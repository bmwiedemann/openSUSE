  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/release-9-5-13.html
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.

    However, if the function marking mistakes mentioned below
    affect you, you will want to take steps to correct your
    database catalogs.
    
    The functions query_to_xml, cursor_to_xml, cursor_to_xmlschema,
    query_to_xmlschema, and query_to_xml_and_xmlschema should be
    marked volatile because they execute user-supplied queries
    that might contain volatile operations. They were not,
    leading to a risk of incorrect query optimization. This has
    been repaired for new installations by correcting the initial
    catalog data, but existing installations will continue to
    contain the incorrect markings. Practical use of these
    functions seems to pose little hazard, but in case of trouble,
    it can be fixed by manually updating these functions' pg_proc
    entries, for example: ALTER FUNCTION
    pg_catalog.query_to_xml(text, boolean, boolean, text) VOLATILE.
    (Note that that will need to be done in each database of the
    installation.) Another option is to pg_upgrade the database to
    a version containing the corrected initial data.

- Update to PostgreSQL 9.5.12:
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/release-9-5-12.html
    A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.

    However, if you run an installation in which not all users are
    mutually trusting, or if you maintain an application or
    extension that is intended for use in arbitrary situations, it
    is strongly recommended that you read the documentation changes
    described in the first changelog entry in the link above, and
    take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or code is
    secure.

    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry in
    the link above may cause functions used in index expressions or
    materialized views to fail during auto-analyze, or when
    reloading from a dump. After upgrading, monitor the server logs
    for such problems, and fix affected functions.

- Security and bugfix release 9.5.2: (bnc# 978456)
  This release closes security hole CVE-2016-2193, where a query
  plan might get reused for more than one ROLE in the same session.
  This could cause the wrong set of Row Level Security (RLS)
  policies to be used for the query.

  The update also fixes CVE-2016-3065, a server crash bug triggered
  by using pageinspect with BRIN index pages. Since an attacker
  might be able to expose a few bytes of server memory, this crash
  is being treated as a security issue.

  - Fix two bugs in indexed ROW() comparisons
  - Avoid data loss due to renaming files
  - Prevent an error in rechecking rows in SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE
  - Fix bugs in multiple json_ and jsonb_ functions
  - Log lock waits for INSERT ON CONFLICT correctly
  - Ignore recovery_min_apply_delay until reaching a consistent
    state
  - Fix issue with pg_subtrans XID wraparound
  - Fix assorted bugs in Logical Decoding
  - Fix planner error with nested security barrier views
  - Prevent memory leak in GIN indexes
  - Fix two issues with ispell dictionaries
  - Avoid a crash on old Windows versions
  - Skip creating an erroneous delete script in pg_upgrade
  - Correctly translate empty arrays into PL/Perl
  - Make PL/Python cope with identifier names

- changes from 9.5.1 (bnc# 966435 bnc# 966436 bnc# 978323)
  This release closes security hole CVE-2016-0773, an issue with
  regular expression (regex) parsing. Prior code allowed users to
  pass in expressions which included out-of-range Unicode
  characters, triggering a backend crash. This issue is critical
  for PostgreSQL systems with untrusted users or which generate
  regexes based on user input.

  The update also fixes CVE-2016-0766, a privilege escalation issue
  for users of PL/Java. Certain custom configuration settings
  (GUCS) for PL/Java will now be modifiable only by the database
  superuser.

  In addition to the above, many other issues were patched in this
  release based on bugs reported by our users over the last few
  months. This includes multiple fixes for new features introduced
  in version 9.5.0, as well as refactoring of pg_dump to eliminate
  a number of chronic issues with backing up EXTENSIONs. Among them
  are:

  - Fix many issues in pg_dump with specific object types
  - Prevent over-eager pushdown of HAVING clauses for GROUPING SETS
  - Fix deparsing error with ON CONFLICT ... WHERE clauses
  - Fix tableoid errors for postgres_fdw
  - Prevent floating-point exceptions in pgbench
  - Make \det search Foreign Table names consistently
  - Fix quoting of domain constraint names in pg_dump
  - Prevent putting expanded objects into Const nodes
  - Allow compile of PL/Java on Windows
  - Fix "unresolved symbol" errors in PL/Python execution
  - Allow Python2 and Python3 to be used in the same database
  - Add support for Python 3.5 in PL/Python
  - Fix issue with subdirectory creation during initdb
  - Make pg_ctl report status correctly on Windows
  - Suppress confusing error when using pg_receivexlog with older
    servers
  - Multiple documentation corrections and additions
  - Fix erroneous hash calculations in gin_extract_jsonb_path()
  - This update also contains tzdata release 2016a, with updates
    for Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, Trans-Baikal Territory
    (Zabaykalsky Krai), and Pakistan.

- changes from 9.5.0
  A most-requested feature by application developers for several
  years, "UPSERT" is shorthand for "INSERT, ON CONFLICT UPDATE",
  allowing new and updated rows to be treated the same. UPSERT
  simplifies web and mobile application development by enabling the
  database to handle conflicts between concurrent data changes.
  This feature also removes the last significant barrier to
  migrating legacy MySQL applications to PostgreSQL.

  Developed over the last two years by Heroku programmer Peter
  Geoghegan, PostgreSQL's implementation of UPSERT is significantly
  more flexible and powerful than those offered by other relational
  databases. The new ON CONFLICT clause permits ignoring the new
  data, or updating different columns or relations in ways which
  will support complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) toolchains
  for bulk data loading. And, like all of PostgreSQL, it is
  designed to be absolutely concurrency-safe and to integrate
  with all other PostgreSQL features, including Logical
  Replication.

  PostgreSQL continues to expand database security capabilities
  with its new Row Level Security (RLS) feature. RLS implements
  true per-row and per-column data access control which integrates
  with external label-based security stacks such as SE Linux.
  PostgreSQL is already known as "the most secure by default." RLS
  cements its position as the best choice for applications with
  strong data security requirements, such as compliance with PCI,
  the European Data Protection Directive, and healthcare data
  protection standards.

  RLS is the culmination of five years of security features added
  to PostgreSQL, including extensive work by KaiGai Kohei of NEC,
  Stephen Frost of Crunchy Data, and Dean Rasheed. Through it,
  database administrators can set security "policies" which filter
  which rows particular users are allowed to update or view. Data
  security implemented this way is resistant to SQL injection
  exploits and other application-level security holes.

  PostgreSQL 9.5 includes multiple new features for bigger
  databases, and for integrating with other Big Data systems. These
  features ensure that PostgreSQL continues to have a strong role
  in the rapidly growing open source Big Data marketplace. Among
  them are:

  BRIN Indexing: This new type of index supports creating tiny, but
  effective indexes for very large, "naturally ordered" tables. For
  example, tables containing logging data with billions of rows
  could be indexed and searched in 5% of the time required by
  standard BTree indexes.

  Faster Sorts: PostgreSQL now sorts text and NUMERIC data faster,
  using an algorithm called "abbreviated keys". This makes some
  queries which need to sort large amounts of data 2X to 12X
  faster, and can speed up index creation by 20X.

  CUBE, ROLLUP and GROUPING SETS: These new standard SQL clauses
  let users produce reports with multiple levels of summarization
  in one query instead of requiring several. CUBE will also enable
  tightly integrating PostgreSQL with more Online Analytic
  Processing (OLAP) reporting tools such as Tableau.

  Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs): These already allow using
  PostgreSQL as a query engine for other Big Data systems such as
  Hadoop and Cassandra. Version 9.5 adds IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA and
  JOIN pushdown making query connections to external databases both
  easier to set up and more efficient.

  TABLESAMPLE: This SQL clause allows grabbing a quick statistical
  sample of huge tables, without the need for expensive sorting.

  "The new BRIN index in PostgreSQL 9.5 is a powerful new feature
  which enables PostgreSQL to manage and index volumes of data that
  were impractical or impossible in the past. It allows scalability
  of data and performance beyond what was considered previously
  attainable with traditional relational databases and makes
  PostgreSQL a perfect solution for Big Data analytics," said Boyan
  Botev, Lead Database Administrator, Premier, Inc.

- Security and bugfix release 9.3.3:
  * Shore up GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION restrictions
    (CVE-2014-0060, bnc#864845)
  * Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
    functions (CVE-2014-0061, bnc#864846)
  * Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL
    (CVE-2014-0062, bnc#864847)
  * Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings
    (CVE-2014-0063, bnc#864850)
  * Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size
    calculations (CVE-2014-0064, bnc#864851)

    bnc#864853)
  * Document risks of make check in the regression testing
    instructions (CVE-2014-0067)

  * Rework tuple freezing protocol. The logic for tuple freezing
    was unable to handle some cases involving freezing of
    multixact IDs, with the practical effect that shared row-level
    locks might be forgotten once old enough. Fixing this required
    changing the WAL record format for tuple freezing. While this
    is no issue for standalone servers, when using replication it
    means that STANDBY SERVERS MUST BE UPGRADED TO 9.3.3 OR LATER
    BEFORE THEIR MASTERS ARE.

- Updated to version 9.2.4 (bnc#812525):
  * CVE-2013-1899: Fix insecure parsing of server command-line
    switches. A connection request containing a database name that
    begins with "-" could be crafted to damage or destroy files
    within the server's data directory, even if the request is
    eventually rejected.
  * CVE-2013-1900: Reset OpenSSL randomness state in each
    postmaster child process. This avoids a scenario wherein
    random numbers generated by "contrib/pgcrypto" functions might
    be relatively easy for another database user to guess. The
    risk is only significant when the postmaster is configured
    with ssl = on but most connections don't use SSL encryption.
  * CVE-2013-1901: Make REPLICATION privilege checks test current
    user not authenticated user.  An unprivileged database user
    could exploit this mistake to call pg_start_backup() or
    pg_stop_backup(), thus possibly interfering with creation of
    routine backups.

  * Reduce PANIC to ERROR in some occasionally-reported btree
    failure cases, and provide additional detail in the resulting
    error messages.

  * Fix incorrect search logic for partial-match queries with GIN
    indexes.

  * Prevent show_session_authorization() from crashing within
    autovacuum processes.

  * Defend against functions returning setof record where not all
    the returned rows are actually of the same rowtype.

  * Fix possible corruption of pending trigger event lists during
    subtransaction rollback.

  * Fix possible failure when hashing a pass-by-reference function
    result.

  * Improve merge join's handling of NULLs in the join columns.

  * Take care to fsync the contents of lockfiles (both
    postmaster.pid and the socket lockfile) while writing them.

  * Avoid recursion while assigning XIDs to heavily-nested
    subtransactions.

  * Avoid holding open old WAL segments in the walwriter process.

  * Fix log_line_prefix's %i escape, which could produce junk
    early in backend startup.

  * Prevent misinterpretation of partially-specified relation
    options for TOAST tables.

  * Fix inheritance count tracking in ALTER TABLE ... ADD
    CONSTRAINT.

  * Fix possible data corruption in ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE
    when archiving is enabled.

  * Allow CREATE DATABASE and ALTER DATABASE ... SET TABLESPACE to
    be interrupted by query-cancel.

  * Improve CREATE INDEX's checking of whether proposed index
    expressions are immutable.

  * Fix REASSIGN OWNED to handle operator classes and families.

  * Fix possible core dump when comparing two empty tsquery values.

  * Fix LIKE's handling of patterns containing % followed by _

  * Re-allow input of Julian dates prior to 0001-01-01 AD.

  * Fix PL/pgSQL to throw an error, not crash, if a cursor is
    closed within a FOR loop that is iterating over that cursor.

  * In PL/Python, defend against null pointer results from
    PyCObject_AsVoidPtr and PyCObject_FromVoidPtr

  * In libpq, fix full SSL certificate verification for the case
    where both host and hostaddr are specified.

  * Make psql recognize DISCARD ALL as a command that should not
    be encased in a transaction block in autocommit-off mode.

  * Fix some issues in pg_dump's handling of SQL/MED objects.

  * Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's handling of non-seekable
    archive files. This is important for proper functioning of
    parallel restore.

  * Improve parallel pg_restore's ability to cope with selective
    restore (-L option).

  * Fix ecpg to process data from RETURNING clauses correctly.

  * Fix some memory leaks in ecpg.

  * Improve contrib/dblink's handling of tables containing dropped
    columns.

  * Fix connection leak after "duplicate connection name" errors
    in contrib/dblink.

  * Fix contrib/dblink to handle connection names longer than 62
    bytes correctly.

  * Add hstore(text, text) function to contrib/hstore.

- Security and bugfix release 8.4.4:

  * Enforce restrictions in plperl using an opmask applied to the
    whole interpreter, instead of using Safe.pm. Recent
    developments have convinced us that Safe.pm is too insecure to
    rely on for making plperl trustable. This change removes use of
    Safe.pm altogether, in favor of using a separate interpreter
    with an opcode mask that is always applied. Pleasant side
    effects of the change include that it is now possible to use
    Perl's strict pragma in a natural way in plperl, and that
    Perl's $a and $b variables work as expected in sort routines,
    and that function compilation is significantly
    faster. (CVE-2010-1169)

  * Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from
    pltcl_modules.  PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from
    a database table could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks,
    because there was no restriction on who could create or insert
    into that table. This change disables the feature unless
    pltcl_modules is owned by a superuser. (However, the
    permissions on the table are not checked, so installations that
    really need a less-than-secure modules table can still grant
    suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.) Also, prevent
    loading code into the unrestricted "normal" Tcl interpreter
    unless we are really going to execute a pltclu
    function. (CVE-2010-1170)

  * Fix data corruption during WAL replay of ALTER ... SET
    TABLESPACE.  When archive_mode is on, ALTER ... SET TABLESPACE
    generates a WAL record whose replay logic was incorrect. It
    could write the data to the wrong place, leading to
    possibly-unrecoverable data corruption. Data corruption would
    be observed on standby slaves, and could occur on the master as
    well if a database crash and recovery occurred after committing
    the ALTER and before the next checkpoint.

  * Fix possible crash if a cache reset message is received during
    rebuild of a relcache entry. This error was introduced in 8.4.3
    while fixing a related failure.

  * Apply per-function GUC settings while running the language
    validator for the function.

  * This avoids failures if the function's code is invalid without
    the setting; an example is that SQL functions may not parse if
    the search_path is not correct.

  * Do constraint exclusion for inherited UPDATE and DELETE target
    tables when constraint_exclusion = partition. Due to an
    oversight, this setting previously only caused constraint
    exclusion to be checked in SELECT commands.

  * Do not allow an unprivileged user to reset superuser-only
    parameter settings.  Previously, if an unprivileged user ran
    ALTER USER ... RESET ALL for himself, or ALTER DATABASE
    ... RESET ALL for a database he owns, this would remove all
    special parameter settings for the user or database, even ones
    that are only supposed to be changeable by a superuser. Now,
    the ALTER will only remove the parameters that the user has
    permission to change.

  * Avoid possible crash during backend shutdown if shutdown occurs
    when a CONTEXT addition would be made to log entries.  In some
    cases the context-printing function would fail because the
    current transaction had already been rolled back when it came
    time to print a log message.

  * Fix erroneous handling of %r parameter in recovery_end_command.
    The value always came out zero.

  * Ensure the archiver process responds to changes in
    archive_command as soon as possible.

  * Fix pl/pgsql's CASE statement to not fail when the case
    expression is a query that returns no rows.

  * Update pl/perl's ppport.h for modern Perl versions.

  * Fix assorted memory leaks in pl/python.

  * Handle empty-string connect parameters properly in ecpg.

  * Prevent infinite recursion in psql when expanding a variable
    that refers to itself.

  * Fix psql's \copy to not add spaces around a dot within \copy
    (select ...). Addition of spaces around the decimal point in a
    numeric literal would result in a syntax error.

  * Avoid formatting failure in psql when running in a locale
    context that doesn't match the client_encoding.

  * Fix unnecessary "GIN indexes do not support whole-index scans"
    errors for unsatisfiable queries using contrib/intarray
    operators.

  * Ensure that contrib/pgstattuple functions respond to cancel
    interrupts promptly.

  * Make server startup deal properly with the case that shmget()
    returns EINVAL for an existing shared memory segment.

    This behavior has been observed on BSD-derived kernels
    including OS X. It resulted in an entirely-misleading startup
    failure complaining that the shared memory request size was too
    large.

- Security and bugfix release 8.4.2:

  * CVE-2009-4136: Protect against indirect security threats
    caused by index functions changing session-local state. This
    change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions from
    possibly subverting a superuser's session.

  * CVE-2009-4034: Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded
    null byte in the common name (CN) field. This prevents
    unintended matching of a certificate to a server or client
    name during SSL validation.

  * Fix hash index corruption. The 8.4 change that made hash
    indexes keep entries sorted by hash value failed to update the
    bucket splitting and compaction routines to preserve the
    ordering. So application of either of those operations could
    lead to permanent corruption of an index, in the sense that
    searches might fail to find entries that are present. To deal
    with this, it is recommended to REINDEX any hash indexes you
    may have after installing this update.

 * Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache
   initialization

 * Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary

 * Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times. This
   fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's
   already committed its tuple movements, as well as transient
   errors if a plain VACUUM is interrupted after having truncated
   the table.

 * Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
   calculation. This could occur with extremely large planner
   estimates for the size of a hashjoin's result.

 * Fix crash if a DROP is attempted on an internally-dependent
   object.

 * Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons.

 * Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared
   transactions are not ignored.

 * Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
   accessed within a subtransaction.

 * Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
   logfile.

 * Fix memory leak in postmaster when re-parsing "pg_hba.conf".

 * Make FOR UPDATE/SHARE in the primary query not propagate into
   WITH queries.

 * Fix bug with a WITH RECURSIVE query immediately inside another
   one.

 * Fix concurrency bug in hash indexes. Concurrent insertions
   could cause index scans to transiently report wrong results.

 * Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
   depends on a non-first column of the index.

 * Fix wrong search results for a multi-column GIN index with
   fastupdate enabled.

 * Fix bugs in WAL entry creation for GIN indexes. These bugs were
   masked when full_page_writes was on, but with it off a WAL
   replay failure was certain if a crash occurred before the next
   checkpoint.

 * Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails
   at the end of checkpoint. It's better to treat the problem as
   non-fatal and allow the checkpoint to complete. Future
   checkpoints will retry the removal. Such problems are not
   expected in normal operation, but have been seen to be caused
   by misdesigned Windows anti-virus and backup software.

 * Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows. This is
   another symptom that could happen if some other process
   interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed file.

 * Fix PAM password processing to be more robust.  The previous
   code is known to fail with the combination of the Linux
   pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
   domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since
   it was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the
   PAM stack would pass to it.

 * Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size
   in GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods.  While the old
   2000-byte limit was more than enough for Unix Kerberos
   implementations, tickets issued by Windows Domain Controllers
   can be much larger.

 * Ensure that domain constraints are enforced in constructs like
   ARRAY[...]::domain, where the domain is over an array type.

 * Fix foreign-key logic for some cases involving composite-type
   columns as foreign keys.

 * Ensure that a cursor's snapshot is not modified after it is
   created. This could lead to a cursor delivering wrong results
   if later operations in the same transaction modify the data the
   cursor is supposed to return.

 * Fix CREATE TABLE to properly merge default expressions coming
   from different inheritance parent tables. This used to work but
   was broken in 8.4.

 * Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences. This
   used to work but was broken in 8.3.

 * Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
   FUNCTION.

 * Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions.  In some cases
   these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't -- they're
   equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.

 * Fix incorrect plan construction when using hash aggregation to
   implement DISTINCT for textually identical volatile
   expressions.

 * Fix Assert failure for a volatile SELECT DISTINCT ON expression.

 * Fix ts_stat() to not fail on an empty tsvector value.

 * Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes.

 * Fix encoding handling in xml binary input. If the XML header
   doesn't specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8 by default;
   the previous handling was inconsistent.

 * Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa. An
   error exit from the inner function could result in crashes due
   to failure to re-select the correct Perl interpreter for the
   outer function.

 * Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
   redefined.

 * Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL
   arrays when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function. This
   worked correctly already for non-set-returning functions.

 * Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python.

 * Fix ecpg problem with comments in DECLARE CURSOR statements.

 * Fix ecpg to not treat recently-added keywords as reserved
   words.  This affected the keywords CALLED, CATALOG, DEFINER,
   ENUM, FOLLOWING, INVOKER, OPTIONS, PARTITION, PRECEDING, RANGE,
   SECURITY, SERVER, UNBOUNDED, and WRAPPER.

 * Re-allow regular expression special characters in psql's \df
   function name parameter.

 * In "contrib/pg_standby", disable triggering failover with a
   signal on Windows. This never did anything useful, because
   Windows doesn't have Unix-style signals, but recent changes
   made it actually crash.

 * Put FREEZE and VERBOSE options in the right order in the VACUUM
   command that "contrib/vacuumdb" produces.

 * Fix possible leak of connections when "contrib/dblink"
   encounters an error.

 * Ensure psql's flex module is compiled with the correct system
   header definitions.  This fixes build failures on platforms
   where --enable-largefile causes incompatible changes in the
   generated code.

 * Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
   connection request packets, to improve compatibility with
   future libpq versions.

 * Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current reality
   This includes adding IDT to the default timezone abbreviation
   set.

- Security and bugfix release 8.4.1:

  * Fix WAL page header initialization at the end of archive
    recovery. This could lead to failure to process the WAL in a
    subsequent archive recovery.
  * Fix "cannot make new WAL entries during recovery" error.
  * Fix problem that could make expired rows visible after a crash.
    This bug involved a page status bit potentially not being set
    correctly after a server crash.
  * Disallow RESET ROLE and RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION inside
    security-definer functions. This covers a case that was missed
    in the previous patch that disallowed SET ROLE and SET SESSION
    AUTHORIZATION inside security-definer functions.
    (See CVE-2007-6600)
  * Make LOAD of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op.
  * Formerly, LOAD would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
    but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
  * Make window function PARTITION BY and ORDER BY items always be
    interpreted as simple expressions. In 8.4.0 these lists were
    parsed following the rules used for top-level GROUP BY and
    ORDER BY lists. But this was not correct per the SQL standard,
    and it led to possible circularity.
  * Fix several errors in planning of semi-joins.  These led to
    wrong query results in some cases where IN or EXISTS was used
    together with another join.
  * Fix handling of whole-row references to subqueries that are
    within an outer join. An example is SELECT COUNT(ss.*) FROM
    ... LEFT JOIN (SELECT ...) ss ON .... Here, ss.* would be
    treated as ROW(NULL,NULL,...) for null-extended join rows,
    which is not the same as a simple NULL. Now it is treated as a
    simple NULL.
  * Fix Windows shared-memory allocation code.  This bug led to the
    often-reported "could not reattach to shared memory" error
    message.
  * Fix locale handling with plperl.
    This bug could cause the server's locale setting to change when
    a plperl function is called, leading to data corruption.
  * Fix handling of reloptions to ensure setting one option doesn't
    force default values for others.
  * Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate
    open sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in
    progress.
  * Avoid memory leak for array_agg() in GROUP BY queries.
  * Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
   'HH'/'HH12'. It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
  * Include the fractional part in the result of EXTRACT(second)
    and EXTRACT(milliseconds) for time and time with time zone
    inputs.
    This has always worked for floating-point datetime
    configurations, but was broken in the integer datetime code.
  * Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when x is more than 2 million
    and integer datetimes are in use.
  * Improve performance when processing toasted values in index
    scans. This is particularly useful for PostGIS.
  * Fix a typo that disabled commit_delay.
  * Output early-startup messages to postmaster.log if the server
    is started in silent mode.  Previously such error messages were
    discarded, leading to difficulty in debugging.
  * Remove translated FAQs. They are now on the wiki. The main FAQ
    was moved to the wiki some time ago.
  * Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if postgresql.conf
    is empty.
  * Fix several errors in pg_dump's --binary-upgrade mode.
  * pg_dump --binary-upgrade is used by pg_migrator.
  * Fix contrib/xml2's xslt_process() to properly handle the
    maximum number of parameters (twenty).
  * Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors
    during COPY FROM STDIN.

  * Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files
    when both libraries are installed.

  * Work around gcc bug that causes "floating-point exception"
    instead of "division by zero" on some platforms.

Mon Jul 27 20:24:35 CEST 2009 - poeml@suse.de

- postgresql-8.4.0-sle10-timestamptz.patch added, and applied
  _only_ on SLE10. It fixes a build failure due to a test case that
  seems to be confused by daylight saving time in the time zone
  that the test expects its result (PDT vs. PST). Since this
  failure happened only on SLE10, I assume that the test case isn't
  broken, and some peculiarity on that (rather old now) platform is
  to blame (possibly too old timezone files). Also, the testcase is
  checking correctness when converting timezones > 32 bit, which
  actually seems to work.

    searches failing to find rows they should have found.
  * Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
    localized error message.
  * Fix possible crash in bytea-to-XML mapping.
  * Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked
    from a trigger.
  * Improve optimization of "expression" IN ("expression-list")
    queries.
  * Fix mis-expansion of rule queries when a sub-SELECT appears
    in a function call in FROM, a multi-row VALUES list, or a
    RETURNING list.
  * Fix Assert failure during rescan of an IS NULL search of
    a GiST index.
  * Fix memory leak during rescan of a hashed aggregation plan.
  * Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL

  * Force a checkpoint before "CREATE DATABASE" starts to copy
    files This prevents a possible failure if files had recently
    been deleted in the source database.
  * Prevent possible collision of relfilenode numbers when moving
    a table to another tablespace with "ALTER SET TABLESPACE".
  * Fix incorrect text search headline generation when single
    query item matches first word of text.

    values when using a non-ISO datestyle in an
    "--enable-integer-datetimes" build.
  * Make ILIKE compare characters case-insensitively even when
    they're escaped.
  * Ensure "DISCARD" is handled properly by statement logging.
  * Fix incorrect logging of last-completed-transaction time
    during PITR recovery.
  * Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when
    the passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers
    of columns.
 * Fix small memory leak when using libpq's gsslib parameter.
 * Ensure libgssapi is linked into libpq if needed.
 * Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE ROLE".

Mon Sep 11 16:37:58 CEST 2000 - fober@suse.de

- made postgres run&autobuild on s390:

- src/include/port/linux.h, src/include/storage/s_lock.h:
  s390-assembler test-and-set (thanks to Andreas Jaeger)

- src/template/.similar, src/template/linux_s390:
  created linux_s390-Template from linux_ppc.
  TODO: is -O0 really needed?

- regression test passes (with minor deviations in floating point
  arithmetics)

  TODO: the regression test will not run out of the box as we install
  it.  this is the missing piece, either in postgres-source or in
  .spec
