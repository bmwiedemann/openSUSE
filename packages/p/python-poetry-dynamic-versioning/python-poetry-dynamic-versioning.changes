- update to 1.7.0:
  * The enable command now supports the bypass/override environment variables
    to use a different placeholder version than 0.0.0.
  * The enable command would add "version" to project.dynamic even if it were
    already present.
  * The enable command would set tool.poetry.version to "0.0.0" even if the
    field were already present with a different value.
- update to 1.6.0:
  * CLI: show command to print the version without changing any files.
- update to 1.5.2:
  * The formatting of project.dynamic and tool.poetry.version could be changed
    when triggering the plugin via poetry dynamic-versioning or pip install
    (but not via poetry build or poetry-dynamic-versioning).
- update to 1.5.1:
  * Array formatting was not preserved when changing project.dynamic in
    pyproject.toml.

Mon Jan  6 13:13:22 UTC 2025 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 1.5.0:
  * CLI: When pyproject.toml contains the project section, the enable command
    will add the required fields for Poetry 2.0.0+.
  * For compatibility with Poetry 2.0.0, adjusted Poetry constraint from ^1.2.0
    to >=1.2.0
  * For compatibility with Poetry 2.0.0, when inserting the dynamic version
    into pyproject.toml with PEP 621 mode activated, the plugin ensures not to
    set project.version and tool.poetry.version at the same time.
  * An UnboundLocalError could happen when pyproject.toml was misconfigured.
