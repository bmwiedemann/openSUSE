  <title>JSON converter that Does What I Want</title>
  <description>Other JSON modules require setting several parameters before calling the
conversion methods to do what I want. This module does things by default
that I think should be done when working with JSON in Perl. This module
also encodes and decodes faster than the JSON manpage.pm and the JSON::Syck
manpage in my benchmarks.

This means that any piece of data in Perl (assuming it's valid unicode)
will get converted to something in JSON instead of throwing an exception.
It also means that output will be strict JSON, while accepted input will be
flexible, without having to set any options.

For a list of changes in recent versions, see the documentation for the
JSON::DWIW::Changes manpage.

This module can be downloaded from the
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DO/DOWENS/ manpage.</description>
