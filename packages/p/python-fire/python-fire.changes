Thu Apr  2 01:40:27 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.0:
  * Use Fire on third-party code without making any code changes:
    python -m fire <module>
  * Docstring parsing fix for all lines are blank f01aad3
  * Improved parsing of numpy-style docstrings
  * #187 Expose built-in functions from the standard library (e.g. sin, cos)
  * #149 Support objects implementing __getattr__
  * #205 Fix ctrl-C handling in help screens
  * Support functools.wraps and lru_cache decorated functions
  * Better support for objects with properties
  * Objects with custom __str__ are now treated as Values. E.g. If such an
    object appears in a dict, the dict will still print in line-by-line mode
    rather than showing a help screen by default.
  * Formatting on Windows works properly now

- version update to 0.2.0
  * Help and usage screens
  * Help screens now have a man-page appearance and are shown with less-style pagination. Usage screens are shown when a user-error is encountered. The help and usage screens are considerably cleaner than the default output in previous versions of Fire.
  * Custom serialization
  * If you define a custom __str__ method on an object, that will be used to serialize the object when it is the final result of a Fire command. This means better support for numpy arrays, and better support for custom types.
  * Docstring parsing
  * Notably, docstrings are parsed in order to determine the descriptions to use for arguments in the help screens. We largely support (but not fully) Google, numpy, and RST style docstrings. These are the three most common styles of docstring used in Python code.
  * Access --help naturally
  * You no longer need to separate --help from your command with an extra --. Simply running command -h or command --help will give help, provided there isn't an argument named help in your component.
  * NamedTuples can be indexed both by their field names and by their indexes.
  * Callable objects can both be called, and their members can be accessed.
  * You must use flag syntax to call a callable object; you cannot pass their arguments positionally.
  * Single-hyphen flags are supported
  * You can now specify -flag instead of --flag if preferred. Both work.
  * Short-flags are permitted when their use is unambiguous
  * E.g. if your function has argument alpha, then you can specify its value with -a.
  * Fish completion support
