Sat Jun 29 16:02:19 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.2.0:
  * Email addresses with internationalized local parts could,
    with rare Unicode characters, be returned as valid but
    actually be invalid in their normalized form (returned in the
    `normalized` field). Local parts now re-validated after
    Unicode NFC normalization to ensure that invalid characters
    cannot be injected into the normalized address and that
    characters with length-increasing NFC normalizations cannot
    cause a local part to exceed the maximum length after
    normalization.
  * The length check for email addresses with internationalized
    local parts is now also applied to the original address
    string prior to Unicode NFC normalization, which may be
    longer and could exceed the maximum email address length, to
    protect callers who do not use the returned normalized
    address.
  * Improved error message for IDNA domains that are too long or
    have invalid characters after Unicode normalization.
  * A new option to parse `My Name <address@domain>` strings,
    i.e. a display name plus an email address in angle brackets,
    is now available. It is off by default.
  * Improvements to Python typing.
  * Some additional tests added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 19 07:08:36 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.2:
  * The domain name length limit is corrected from 255 to 253
    IDNA ASCII characters. I misread the RFCs.
  * When a domain name has no MX record but does have an A or
    AAAA record, if none of the IP addresses in the response are
    globally reachable (i.e. not Private-Use, Loopback, etc.),
    the response is treated as if there was no A/AAAA response
    and the email address will fail the deliverability check.
  * When a domain name has no MX record but does have an A or
    AAAA record, the mx field in the object returned by
    validate_email incorrectly held the IP addresses rather than
    the domain itself.
  * Fixes in tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 07:38:28 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.1:
  * Fixed typo 'marking' instead of 'marketing' in case-
    insensitive mailbox name list.
  * When DNS-based deliverability checks fail, in some cases
    exceptions are now thrown with `raise ... from` for better
    nested exception tracking.
  * Fixed tests to work when no local resolver can be configured.
  * This project is now licensed under the Unlicense (instead of
    CC0).
  * Minor improvements to tests.
  * Minor improvements to code style.
- drop dont-require-resolv-tests.patch: obsolete

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 10:02:55 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.0:
  * Python 3.8+ is now required (support for Python 3.7 was
    dropped).
  * The old `email` field on the returned `ValidatedEmail`
    object, which in the previous version was superseded by
    `normalized`, will now raise a deprecation warning if used.
    See https://stackoverflow.com/q/879173 for strategies to
    suppress the DeprecationWarning.
  * A `__version__` module attribute is added.
  * The email address argument to validate_email is now marked as
    positional-only to better reflect the documented usage using
    the new Python 3.8 feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 08:23:47 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Add dont-require-resolv-tests.patch to make tests run without an
  existing /etc/resolv.conf file
- Update to 2.0.0:
  This is a major update to the library, but since email address specs
  haven't changed there should be no significant changes to which
  email addresses are considered valid or invalid with default
  options. There are new options for accepting unusual email addresses
  that were previously always rejected, some changes to how DNS errors
  are handled, many changes in error message text, and major internal
  improvements including the addition of type annotations. Python 3.7+
  is now required. Details follow:

  * Python 2.x and 3.x versions through 3.6, and dnspython 1.x, are no
    longer supported. Python 3.7+ with dnspython 2.x are now required.
  * The dnspython package is no longer required if DNS checks are not
    used, although it will install automatically.
  * NoNameservers and NXDOMAIN DNS errors are now handled differently:
    NoNameservers no longer fails validation, and NXDOMAIN now skips
    checking for an A/AAAA fallback and goes straight to failing
    validation.
  * Some syntax error messages have changed because they are now
    checked explicitly rather than as a part of other checks.
  * The quoted-string local part syntax (e.g. multiple @-signs,
    spaces, etc. if surrounded by quotes) and domain-literal addresses
    (e.g. @[192.XXX...] or @[IPv6:...]) are now parsed but not
    considered valid by default. Better error messages are now given
    for these addresses since it can be confusing for a technically
    valid address to be rejected, and new allow_quoted_local and
    allow_domain_literal options are added to allow these addresses if
    you really need them.
  * Some other error messages have changed to not repeat the email
    address in the error message.
  * The email field on the returned ValidatedEmail object has been
    renamed to normalized to be clearer about its importance, but
    access via .email is also still supported.
  * Some mailbox names like postmaster are now normalized to lowercase
    per RFC 2142.
  * The library has been reorganized internally into smaller modules.
  * The tests have been reorganized and expanded. Deliverability tests
    now mostly use captured DNS responses so they can be run off-line.
  * The main tool now reads options to validate_email from environment
    variables.
  * Type annotations have been added to the exported methods and the
    ValidatedEmail class and some internal methods.
  * The old dict-like pattern for the return value of validate_email
    is deprecated.

  Versions 2.0.0.post1 and 2.0.0.post2 corrected some packaging
  issues. 2.0.0.post2 also added a check for an invalid combination of
  arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 28 13:39:59 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.1:
  * The new SPF 'v=spf1 -all' (reject-all) deliverability check is removed
    in most cases. It now is performed only for domains that do not have MX
    records but do have an A/AAAA fallback record.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 08:06:34 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.0:
  * Deliverability checks now check for 'v=spf1 -all' SPF records as a way to reject more bad domains.
  * Special use domain names now raise EmailSyntaxError instead of EmailUndeliverableError since they are performed even if check_deliverability is off.
  * New module-level attributes are added to override the default values of the keyword arguments and the special-use domains list.
  * The keyword arguments of the public methods are now marked as keyword-only.
  * pyIsEmail's test cases are added to the tests.
  * Recommend that check_deliverability be set to False for validation on login pages.
  * Added an undocumented globally_deliverable option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  8 07:24:18 UTC 2022 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * Rejecting domains with NULL MX records (when deliverability checks are
    turned on).
  * Rejecting unsafe unicode characters. (Some of these checks you should be
    doing on all of your user inputs already!)
  * Rejecting most special-use reserved domain names. A new test_environment
    option is added for using @*.test domains.
  * example and example.com/net/org are removed from the special-use domains
    list.
  * SPECIAL_USE_DOMAIN_NAMES is now a documented part of the API (and it is a
    list instead of a tuple)
  * New module-level attributes ALLOW_SMTPUTF8, CHECK_DELIVERABILITY,
    TEST_ENVIRONMENT, and DEFAULT_TIMEOUT can be used to change the default
    values of the keyword arguments.
- Add patch ignore-urllib3-pyopenssl-warning.patch:
  * Ignore warning as error from requests-toolbelt via dnspython.
