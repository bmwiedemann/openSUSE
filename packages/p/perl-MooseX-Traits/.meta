  <title>Automatically Apply Roles at Object Creation Time</title>
  <description>Often you want to create components that can be added to a class
arbitrarily. This module makes it easy for the end user to use these
components. Instead of requiring the user to create a named class with the
desired roles applied, or apply roles to the instance one-by-one, he can
just create a new class from yours with &quot;with_traits&quot;, and then
instantiate that.
