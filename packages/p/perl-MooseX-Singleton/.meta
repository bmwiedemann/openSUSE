  <title>Turn your Moose class into a Singleton</title>
  <description>A singleton is a class that has only one instance in an application.
&quot;MooseX::Singleton&quot; lets you easily upgrade (or downgrade, as it were)
your Moose class to a singleton.

All you should need to do to transform your class is to change &quot;use Moose&quot;
to &quot;use MooseX::Singleton&quot;. This module uses metaclass roles to do its
magic, so it should cooperate with most other &quot;MooseX&quot; modules.
