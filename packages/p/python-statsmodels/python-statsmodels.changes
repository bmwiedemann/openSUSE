- Update to Release 0.8.0rc1
  + Release summary
    The main features of this release are several new time series models based
    on the statespace framework, multiple imputation using MICE as well as many
    other enhancements. The codebase also has been updated to be compatible with
    recent numpy and pandas releases.
  + Statespace Models
   * Building on the statespace framework and models added in 0.7, this release
     includes additional models that build on it.
  + Kalman Smoother
    * The Kalman smoother (introduced in #2434) allows making inference on the
      unobserved state vector at each point in time using data from the entire
      sample. In addition to this improved inference, the Kalman smoother is required
      for future improvements such as simulation smoothing and the expectation
      maximization (EM) algorithm.
    * As a result of this improvement, all state space models now inherit a `smooth`
      method for producing results with smoothed state estimates. In addition, the
      `fit` method will return results with smoothed estimates at the maximum
      likelihood estimates.
  + Postestimation
    * Improved post-estimation output is now available to all state space models
      (introduced in #2566). This includes the new methods `get_prediction` and
      `get_forecast`, providing standard errors and confidence intervals as well
      as point estimates, `simulate`, providing simulation of time series following
      the given state space process, and `impulse_responses`, allowing computation
      of impulse responses due to innovations to the state vector.
  + Diagnostics
    * `test_normality` implements the Jarque-Bera test for normality of residuals
    * `test_heteroskedasticity` implements a test for homoskedasticity of
      residuals similar to the Goldfeld-Quandt test
    * `test_serial_correlation` implements the Ljung-Box (or Box-Pierce) test for
      serial correlation of residuals
  + Unobserved Components
    * The class of univariate Unobserved Components models (also known as structural
      time series models) are now available (introduced in #2432). This includes as
      special cases the local level model and local linear trend model. Generically
      it allows decomposing a time series into trend, cycle, seasonal, and
      irregular components, optionally with exogenous regressors and / or
      autoregressive errors.
  + Multivariate Models
    * Two standard multivariate econometric models - vector autoregressive
      moving-average model with exogenous regressors (VARMAX) and Dynamic Factors
      models - are now available (introduced in #2563). The first is a popular
      reduced form method of exploring the covariance in several time series, and the
      second is a popular reduced form method of extracting a small number of common
      factors from a large dataset of observed series.
  + Recursive least squares
    * A model for recursive least squares, also known as expanding-window OLS, is
      now available in `statsmodels.regression` (introduced in #2830).
  + Other improvements to the state space framework include:
    * Improved missing data handling #2770, #2809
    * Ongoing refactoring and bug fixes in fringes and corner cases
  + New functionality in statistics
    * Contingency Tables #2418 (Kerby Shedden)
    * Local FDR, multiple testing #2297 (Kerby Shedden)
    * Mediation Analysis #2352 (Kerby Shedden)
    * weighted quantiles in DescrStatsW #2707 (Kerby Shedden)
  + Duration
    * Kaplan Meier Survival Function #2614 (Kerby Shedden)
    * Cumulative incidence rate function #3016 (Kerby Shedden)
    * frequency weights in Kaplan-Meier #2992 (Kerby Shedden)
  + Imputation
    * new subpackage in `statsmodels.imputation`
    * MICE #2076  (Frank Cheng GSOC 2014 and Kerby Shedden)
    * Imputation by regression on Order Statistic  #3019 (Paul Hobson)
  + Time Series Analysis
    * Markov Switching Models
      Markov switching dynamic regression and autoregression models are now
      available (introduced in #2980 by Chad Fulton). These models allow regression
      effects and / or autoregressive dynamics to differ depending on an unobserved
      "regime"; in Markov switching models, the regimes are assumed to transition
      according to a Markov process.
  + Statistics
    * KPSS stationarity, unit root test #2775 (N-Wouda)
    * The Brock Dechert Scheinkman (BDS) test for nonlinear dependence is now
      available (introduced in #934 by Chad Fulton)
  + Penalized Estimation
    * Elastic net: fit_regularized with L1/L2 penalization has been added to
      OLS, GLM and PHReg (Kerby Shedden)
  + GLM
    * Tweedie is now available as new family #2872 (Peter Quackenbush, Josef Perktold)
    * frequency weights for GLM (currently without full support) #
    * more flexible convergence options #2803 (Peter Quackenbush)
  + Multivariate
    * new subpackage that currently contains PCA
    * PCA was added in 0.7 to statsmodels.tools and is now in statsmodels.multivariate
  + Documentation
    * New doc build with latest jupyter and Python 3 compatibility (Tom Augspurger)
  + several existing functions have received improvements
    * seasonal_decompose: improved periodicity handling #2987 (ssktotoro ?)
    * tools add_constant, add_trend: refactoring and pandas compatibility #2240 (Kevin Sheppard)
    * acf, pacf, acovf: option for missing handling #3020 (joesnacks ?)
    * acf, pacf plots: allow array of lags #2989 (Kevin Sheppard)
    * io SimpleTable (summary): allow names with special characters #3015 (tvanessa ?)
    * tsa tools lagmat, lagmat2ds: pandas support #2310 #3042 (Kevin Sheppard)
    * CompareMeans: from_data, summary methods #2754 (Valery Tyumen)
  + Major Bugs fixed
    * see github issues
  + Backwards incompatible changes and deprecations
    * predict now returns a pandas Series if the exog argument is a DataFrame
    * PCA moved to multivariate compared to 0.7
- Update to Release 0.7.0 (never officially released)
  + Principal Component Analysis
    * Options to control the standardization (demeaning/studentizing)
    * Scree plotting
    * Information criteria for selecting the number of factors
    * R-squared plots to assess component fit
    * NIPALS implementation when only a small number of components are required
      and the dataset is large
    * Missing-value filling using the EM algorithm
  + Regression graphics for GLM/GEE
    * Added variable plots, partial residual plots, and CERES residual plots
      are available for GLM and GEE models by calling the methods
      `plot_added_variable`, `plot_partial_residuals`, and
      `plot_ceres_residuals` that are attached to the results classes.
  + State Space Models
    * State space methods provide a flexible structure for the estimation and
      analysis of a wide class of time series models. The Statsmodels implementation
      allows specification of state models, fast Kalman filtering, and built-in
      methods to facilitate maximum likelihood estimation of arbitrary models. One of
      the primary goals of this module is to allow end users to create and estimate
      their own models. Below is a short example demonstrating the ease with which a
      local level model can be specified and estimated:
  + Time Series Models (ARIMA) with Seasonal Effects
    * Additive and multiplicative seasonal effects
    * Flexible trend specications
    * Regression with SARIMA errors
    * Regression with time-varying coefficients
    * Measurement error in the endogenous variables
  + Generalized Estimating Equations GEE
    * EquivalenceClass covariance structure allows covariances to be specified by
      arbitrary collections of equality constraints #2188
    * add weights #2090
    * refactored margins #2158
  + MixedLM
    * added variance components support for MixedLM allowing a wider range of
      random effects structures to be specified
    * performance improvements from use of sparse matrices internally for
      random effects design matrices.
  + Other important new features
