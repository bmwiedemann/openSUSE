    - Remove internal commands from HTML and man command references.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Update PostgreSQL versions used to build user guides. Also add 
      version ranges to indicate that a user guide is accurate for a 
      range of PostgreSQL versions even if it was built for a 
      specific version.
    - Update FAQ for expiring a specific backup set.
    - Update FAQ to clarify default PITR behavior.

- update to version 2.27 Expiration Improvements Compression Drivers
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix issue checking if file links are contained in path links.
    - Allow pg-path1 to be optional for synchronous archive-push.
    - The expire command now checks if a stop file is present.
    - Handle missing reason phrase in HTTP response.
    - Increase buffer size for lz4 compression flush.
    - Ignore pg-host* and repo-host* options for the remote command.
    - Fix possibly missing pg1-* options for the remote command.
  + Features:
    - Time-based retention for full backups. 
      The --repo-retention-full-type option allows retention of full 
      backups based on a time period, specified in days.
    - Ad hoc backup expiration. Allow the user to remove a specified
      backup regardless of retention settings.
    - Zstandard compression support. Note that setting compress-type=zst
      will make new backups and archive incompatible (unrestorable)
      with prior versions of pgBackRest.
    - bzip2 compression support. Note that setting compress-type=bz2
      will make new backups and archive incompatible (unrestorable) 
      with prior versions of pgBackRest.
    - Add backup/expire running status to the info command.
  + Improvements:
    - Expire WAL archive only when repo-retention-archive threshold 
      is met. WAL prior to the first full backup was previously 
      expired after the first full backup. Now it is preserved 
      according to retention settings.
    - Add local MD5 implementation so S3 works when FIPS is enabled.
    - PostgreSQL 13 beta1 support. Changes to the control/catalog/WAL
      versions in subsequent betas may break compatibility but 
      pgBackRest will be updated with each release to keep pace.
    - Reduce buffer-size default to 1MiB.
    - Throw user-friendly error if expire is not run on repository host.
- Packaging : add bz2 buildrequire 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  1 16:13:03 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to version 2.26 : Non-blocking TLS
  + Bug Fix : Remove empty subexpression from manifest regular 
    expression. MacOS was not happy about this though other
    platforms seemed to work fine.
  + Improvements:
    - N on-blocking TLS implementation.
    - Only limit backup copy size for WAL-logged files. The prior
      behavior could possibly lead to postgresql.conf or 
      postgresql.auto.conf being truncated in the backup.
    - TCP keep-alive options are configurable.
    - Add io-timeout option.
- update to version 2.25 : LZ4 Compression Support
  + Features:
    - Add lz4 compression support. Note that setting 
      compress-type=lz4 will make new backups and archive incompatible
      (unrestorable) with prior versions of pgBackRest.
    - Add --dry-run option to the expire command. Use dry-run to see
      which backups/archive would be removed by the expire command 
      without actually removing anything.
  + Improvements:
    - Improve performance of remote manifest build.
    - Fix detection of keepalive options on Linux.
    - Add configure host detection to set standards flags correctly.
    - Remove compress/compress-level options from commands where unused.
    - Limit backup file copy size to size reported at backup start. 
      If a file grows during the backup it will be reconstructed by 
      WAL replay during recovery so there is no need to copy the 
      additional data.
- Packaging:
  + Add new requirement lz4
  + Redo patch libpq-fe.h_localisation.patch to include configure

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 24 14:34:27 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to 2.24 version : Bugfix
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Prevent defunct processes in asynchronous archive commands.
    - Error when archive-get/archive-push/restore are not run on a
      PostgreSQL host.
    - Read HTTP content to eof when size/encoding not specified.
    - Fix resume when the resumable backup was created by Perl. In
      this case the resumable backup should be ignored, but the C
      code was not able to load the partial manifest written by Perl
      since the format differs slightly.
      Add validations to catch this case and continue gracefully.
  + Features:
    - Auto-select backup set on restore when time target is specified.
      Auto-selection is performed only when --set is not specified.
      If a backup set for the given target time cannot not be found,
      the latest (default) backup set will be used.
  + Improvements:
    - Skip pg_internal.init temp file during backup.
    - Add more validations to the manifest on backup.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Prevent lock-bot from adding comments to locked issues.
- Packaging
  + use %autopatch
  + use a normalized name for source %name-%version.tar.gz
  + spec cleaning
  + Refresh patch libpq-fe.h_localisation.patch
  + Delete merged upstream_wrongly_bring_back_pg_config.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 27 20:27:02 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to 2.23 : Bugfix
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix missing files corrupting the manifest. If a file was
    removed by PostgreSQL during the backup (or was missing from
    the standby) then the next file might not be copied and updated
    in the manifest. If this happened then the backup would error
    when restored.
  + Improvements:
    - Use pkg-config instead of xml2-config for libxml2 build options.
    - Validate checksums are set in the manifest on backup/restore.
- Introduce upstream_wrongly_bring_back_pg_config.patch to fix
  upstream code (using pg_config in client code)
  Upstream issue #920

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 14:26:33 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to 2.22 : Bugfix
  + Fix error in timeline conversion. The timeline is required to
  verify WAL segments in the archive after a backup. The conversion
  was performed base 10 instead of 16, which led to errors when the
  timeline was ≥ 0xA.
- update to 2.21 : C Migration Complete
  + Bug Fixes
    - Fix options being ignored by asynchronous commands. The
    asynchronous archive-get/archive-push processes were not
    loading options configured in command configuration sections,
    e.g. [global:archive-get].
    - Fix handling of \ in filenames. \ was not being properly
    escaped when calculating the manifest checksum which prevented
    the manifest from loading. Since instances of \ in cluster
    filenames should be rare to nonexistent this does not seem
    likely to be a serious problem in the field.
  + Features:
    - pgBackRest is now pure C.
    - Add pg-user option. Specifies the database user name when
    connecting to PostgreSQL. If not specified pgBackRest will
    connect with the local OS user or PGUSER, which was the previous
    behavior.
    - Allow path-style URIs in S3 driver.
  + Improvements:
    - The backup command is implemented entirely in C.
- update to 2.20 : Bug fixes
  + Fix archive-push/archive-get when PGDATA is symlinked. These
  commands tried to use cwd() as PGDATA but this would disagree
  with the path configured in pgBackRest if PGDATA was symlinked.
  If cwd() does not match the pgBackRest path then chdir() to the
  path and make sure the next cwd() matches the result from the
  first call.
  + Fix reference list when backup.info is reconstructed in expire
  command. Since the backup command is still using the Perl version
  of reconstruct this issue will not express unless 1) there is a
  backup missing from backup.info and 2) the expire command is run
  directly instead of running after backup as usual. This unlikely
  combination of events means this is probably not a problem in the
  field.
  + Fix segfault on unexpected EOF in gzip decompression.
- Update and cleanup spec
  + Remove all uneeded Perl related part
  + Update copyright

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  4 13:47:03 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- update to 2.19 : C Migrations and Bug Fixes
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix remote timeout in delta restore. When performing a delta
   restore on a largely unchanged cluster the remote could timeout
   if no files were fetched from the repository within
   protocol-timeout. Add keep-alives to prevent remote timeout.
    - Fix handling of repeated HTTP headers. When HTTP headers are
    repeated they should be considered equivalent to a single
    comma-separated header rather than generating an error, which
    was the prior behavior.
  + Improvements:
    - JSON output from the info command is no longer pretty-printed.
    Monitoring systems can more easily ingest the JSON without linefeeds.
    External tools such as jq can be used to pretty-print if desired.
    - The check command is implemented entirely in C.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Document how to contribute to pgBackRest.
    - Document maximum version for auto-stop option.
  + Test Suite Improvements:
    - Fix container test path being used when --vm=none.
    - Fix mismatched timezone in expect test.
    - Don't autogenerate embedded libc code by default.
- Cleanup spec (license and pkgconfig)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  6 14:09:55 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to 2.18 version PostgreSQL 12 Support
  + Features:
    - PostgreSQL 12 support.
    - Add info command set option for detailed text output.
    - Add standby restore type. This automatically adds
      standby_mode=on to recovery.conf for PostgreSQL < 12
      and creates standby.signal for PostgreSQL ≥ 12, creating a
      common interface between PostgreSQL versions.
  + Improvements:
    - The restore command is implemented entirely in C.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Document the relationship between db-timeout and protocol-timeout.
    - Add documentation clarifications regarding standby repositories.
    - Add FAQ for time-based Point-in-Time Recovery.
- Update to 2.17 version C Migrations and Bug Fixes
  + Bug fixes:
    - Improve slow manifest build for very large quantities of
      tables/segments.
    - Fix exclusions for special files.
  + Improvements:
    - The stanza-create/update/delete commands are implemented entirely in C.
    - The start/stop commands are implemented entirely in C.
    - Create log directories/files with 0750/0640 mode.
  + Documentation Bug Fixes:
    - Fix yum.p.o package being installed when custom package specified.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Build pgBackRest as an unprivileged user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 24 16:31:39 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to 2.16 release C Migrations and Bug Fixes
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Retry S3 RequestTimeTooSkewed errors instead of immediately
    terminating.
    - Fix incorrect handling of transfer-encoding response to HEAD
      request.
    - Fix scoping violations exposed by optimizations in gcc 9.
  + Features:
    - Add repo-s3-port option for setting a non-standard S3
      service port.
  + Improvements:
    - The local command for backup is implemented entirely in C.
    - The check command is implemented partly in C.
- Packaging adding new libpq-fe dependency
- Added patch libpq-fe.h_localisation.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 12:09:42 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to 2.15.1 release
  + Bug Fixes:
    Fix archive retention expiring too aggressively.
  + Improvements:
    The expire command is implemented entirely in C.
    The local command for restore is implemented entirely in C.
    Remove hard-coded PostgreSQL user so $PGUSER works.
    Honor configure --prefix option.
    Rename repo-s3-verify-ssl option to repo-s3-verify-tls.
    The new name is preferred because pgBackRest does not support
    any SSL protocol versions (they are all considered to be insecure).
    The old name will continue to be accepted.
- Packaging:
  + export %optflag as CFLAG
  + fix make install with new supported prefix

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 05:59:01 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Emergency rollback, 2.14 segv

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 15:24:17 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to 2.14 release
  + Bug Fixes:
    Fix segfault when process-max > 8 for archive-push/archive-get.
  + Improvements:
    Bypass database checks when stanza-delete issued with force.
    Add configure script for improved multi-platform support.
  + Documentation Features:
    Add user guides for CentOS/RHEL 6/7.
- 2.13 release
  + Bug Fixes:
    Fix zero-length reads causing problems for IO filters that
    did not expect them.
    Fix reliability of error reporting from local/remote processes.
    Fix Posix/CIFS error messages reporting the wrong filename on
    write/sync/close.
- 2.12 release
  + IMPORTANT NOTE: The new TLS/SSL implementation forbids dots in
   S3 bucket names per RFC-2818. This security fix is required for
   compliant hostname verification.
  + Bug Fixes:
    Fix issues when a path option is / terminated.
    Fix issues when log-level-file=off is set for the archive-get
    command.
    Fix C code to recognize host:port option format like Perl does.
    Fix issues with remote/local command logging options.
   + Improvements:
    The archive-push command is implemented entirely in C.
    Increase process-max limit to 999.
    Improve error message when an S3 bucket name contains dots.
   + Documentation Improvements:
    Clarify that S3-compatible object stores are supported.
- Packaging: add autoconf upstream is now using configure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 11 09:10:56 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

    - Fix info command missing WAL min/max when stanza specified.
    - Fix non-compliant JSON for options passed from C to Perl.
  + Improvements:
    - The archive-get command is implemented entirely in C.
    - Enable socket keep-alive on older Perl versions.
    - Error when parameters are passed to a command that does not
      accept parameters.
    - Add hints when unable to find a WAL segment in the archive.
    - Improve error when hostname cannot be found in a
      certificate.
    - Add additional options to backup.manifest for debugging
      purposes.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Update default documentation version to PostgreSQL 10.
- Packaging:
  + Remove merge upstream patch (2cd204f.patch)
  + Fix install destination to %{_bindir}

Fri Feb  8 20:02:00 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to 2.09 version bug fixes and improvements
  + Fix issue with multiple async status files causing a hard error.
  + info command is implemented entirely in C.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 16:25:46 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Fix packaging : Avoid segv backtrace
  + Don't package and distribute perl or LibC
  They are already in final binary.
  Ref https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/issues/558
  + As a result : tests are no more usable, (only vagrant runs)
  use a simple call of the binary (pgbackrest version) to exclude
  futur backtrace
  + Clean spec: licence and remove macro for file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 11 07:49:49 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Critical bug fix release 2.04 (Backup Resume)
  + IMPORTANT NOTE: This release fixes a critical bug in the backup
    resume feature. All resumed backups prior to this release should
    be considered inconsistent.
    See more information https://pgbackrest.org/release.html
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix critical bug in resume that resulted in inconsistent
    backups. A regression in v0.82 removed the timestamp comparison
    when deciding which files from the aborted backup to keep on
    resume.
    - Fix error in selective restore when only one user database
    exists in the cluster.
    - Fix non-compliant ISO-8601 timestamp format in S3 authorization
    headers. AWS and some gateways were tolerant of space rather than
    zero-padded hours while others were not.
  + Features:
    - PostgreSQL 11 Beta 2 support.
  + Improvements:
    - Improve the HTTP client to set content-length to 0 when not
    specified by the server. S3 (and gateways) always set
    content-length or transfer-encoding but HTTP 1.1 does not require
    it and proxies (e.g. HAProxy) may not include either.
    - Set search_path = 'pg_catalog' on PostgreSQL connections
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Create a new section to describe building pgBackRest and
    build on a separate host.
    - Add sample S3 policy to restrict bucket privileges.
- Packaging :
  + Explicitly requires all perl deps
  + Define make_build for 42.3 compilation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 28 08:21:30 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Urgent fix : add perl as BuildRequires and Requires to force
  presence of libperl.so : Otherwise pgbackrest binary can't find
  it
- Spec : use %make_build macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 23 09:55:27 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update release 2.03 version
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix potential buffer overrun in error message handling.
    - Fix archive write lock being taken for the synchronous
      archive-get command.
  + Improvements:
    - Embed exported C functions and Perl modules directly into
      the pgBackRest executable.
    - Use time_t instead of __time_t for better portability.
    - Print total runtime in milliseconds at command end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 10 10:12:23 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to bugfix & improvement 2.02 version
  Parallel Asynchronous Archive Get and Configuration Includes
  Released May 6, 2018
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fix directory syncs running recursively when only the
      specified directory should be synced.
    - Fix archive-copy throwing "path not found" error for incr/diff
      backups.
    - Fix failure in manifest build when two or more files in PGDATA
      are linked to the same directory.
    - Fix delta restore failing when a linked file is missing.
    - Fix rendering of key/value and list options in help.
  + Features:
    - Add asynchronous, parallel archive-get. This feature maintains
      a queue of WAL segments to help reduce latency when PostgreSQL
      requests a WAL segment with restore_command.
    - Add support for additional pgBackRest configuration files in the
      directory specified by the --config-include-path option.
      Add --config-path option for overriding the default base path
      of the --config and --config-include-path option.
    - Add repo-s3-token option to allow temporary credentials tokens
      to be configured. pgBackRest currently has no way to request new
      credentials so the entire command (e.g. backup, restore) must
      complete before the credentials expire.
  + Improvements:
    - Update the archive-push-queue-max, manifest-save-threshold,
      and buffer-size options to accept values in KB, MB, GB, TB, PB
      where the multiplier is a power of 1024.
    - Make backup/restore path sync more efficient. Scanning the
      entire directory can be very expensive if there are a lot of
      small tables. The backup manifest contains the path list so use
      it to perform syncs instead of scanning the backup/restore path
    - Show command parameters as well as command options in initial
      info log message.
    - Rename archive-queue-max option to archive-push-queue-max to
      avoid confusion with the new archive-get-queue-max option.
      The old option name will continue to be accepted.
  + Documentation Bug Fixes:
    - Update docs with 32-bit support and caveats.
      32-bit support was added in v1.26.
  + Documentation Improvements:
    - Add monitoring examples using PostgreSQL and jq.
    - Add example of command section usage to archiving configuration.
    - Remove documentation info --output=json as experimental.
    - Update out-of-date description for the spool-path option.
  + Test Suite Features:
    - Use lcov for C unit test coverage reporting. Switch from
      Devel::Cover because it would not report on branch coverage
      for reports converted from gcov. Incomplete branch coverage
      for a module now generates an error. Coverage of unit tests
      is not displayed in the report unless they are incomplete for
      either statement or branch coverage.
- Changes of previous 2.01 version from March 6th 2018
  + Bug Fixes:
   - Fix --target-action and --recovery-option options being reported
     as invalid when restoring with --type=immediate.
   - Immediately error when a secure option (e.g. repo1-s3-key) is
     passed on the command line. Since pgBackRest would not pass
     secure options on to sub-processes an obscure error was thrown.
     The new error is much clearer and provides hints about how to fix
     the problem. Update command documentation to omit secure options
     that cannot be specified on the command-line.
   - Fix issue passing --no-config to embedded Perl.
   - Fix issue where specifying log-level-stderr > warn would cause a
     local/remote process to error on exit due to output found on
     stderr when none was expected. The max value for a local/remote
     process is now error.
   - Fix manifest test in the check command when tablespaces are
     present.
  + Improvements:
   - Error when multiple arguments are set in the config file for an
     option that does not accept multiple arguments.
   - Remove extraneous sudo commands from src/Makefile.
  + Documentation Improvements:
   - Show index in examples for indexed options, i.e. repo-*, pg-*.
   - Simplify table of contents on command page by only listing
     commands.
   - Remove references to the C library being optional.
  + Test Suite Features:
   - Add CentOS/RHEL package builds.
   - Use clang for static code analysis. Nothing found initially
     except for some functions that should have been marked
     __noreturn__.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 15:16:24 UTC 2018 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Packaging :
  + modernize spec with spec-cleaner -m
  + remove pgbackrest-release-1.00_datadir.patch pgbackrest is now
    written in C
  + Build C binary and lib C
  + Adjust new parameter name in pgbackrest-conf.patch
- Update to new 2.0 version
  + Features:
    The archive-push command is now partially coded in C which
    allows the PostgreSQL archive_command to run significantly
    faster when processing status messages from the asynchronous
    archive process. (Reviewed by Cynthia Shang.)
  + Improvements:
    - Improve check command to verify that the backup manifest can be
    built. (Contributed by Cynthia Shang.)
    - Improve performance of HTTPS client. Buffering now takes the
    pending bytes on the socket into account (when present) rather
    than relying entirely on select(). In some instances the final
    bytes would not be flushed until the connection was closed.
    - Improve S3 delete performance. The constant S3_BATCH_MAX had
    been replaced with a hard-coded value of 2, probably during
    testing.
    - Allow any non-command-line option to be reset to default on
    the command-line. This allows options in pgbackrest.conf to be
    reset to default which reduces the need to write new config
    files for specific needs.
    - The C library is now required. This eliminates conditional
    loading and eases development of new library features.
    - The pgbackrest executable is now a C binary instead of Perl.
    This allows certain time-critical commands (like async
    archive-push) to run more quickly.
    - Rename db-* options to pg-* and backup-* options to repo-* to
    improve consistency. repo-* options are now indexed although
    currently only one is allowed.
    ** This imply you need to revisit your pgbackrest.conf **
- Packaging :
  + Use make install (now fixed upstream) for bin

- Upgrade to 1.28 bugfix version
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed inability to restore a single database contained in a
    tablespace using --db-include. (Fixed by Cynthia Shang.)
    - Ensure latest db-id is selected on when matching archive.info
    to backup.info. This provides correct matching in the event
    there are system-id and db-version duplicates
    (e.g. after reverting a pg_upgrade).
    (Fixed by Cynthia Shang. Reported by Adam K. Sumner.)
    - Fixed overly chatty error message when reporting an invalid
    command. (Reported by Jason O'Donnell.)
  + Features:
    Add stanza-delete command to cleanup unused stanzas.
    (Contributed by Cynthia Shang. Suggested by Magnus Hagander.)
  + Improvements:
    Improve stanza-create command so that it does not error when
    the stanza already exists. (Contributed by Cynthia Shang.)
