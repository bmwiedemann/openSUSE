- Disable python3 building as the mockito is py2 only (git master
  is py3 compatible so hopefully next release should be supported)

- Update to 1.1.1:
  * Added forget_invocations function. Thanks to @maximkulkin
  * Fix: The context manager (with) has now a proper implementation
  * Fix: Calling patch with two arguments can now be used with with
  * Fix: Do not treat the placeholder arguments (Ellipsis, args, kwargs) as special on call time anymore. (T.i. they only have a meaning when stubbing or verifying.)
  * Enhancement: Changed some truthy or equality tests to identity (is) tests. This reduces edge-cases where some user object defines __eq__ or __bool__. (Hello _numpy_!)
- Run tests

Mon Dec 11 19:47:18 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 1.0.12
 * see CHANGES.txt for a detailed changelog
 * changes in version 1.0.12:
  - Better error messages for failed verifications.
 * changes in version 1.0.7 - 1.0.10
  - ``verifyZeroInteractions`` implemented. This is actually a *breaking change*, because ``verifyZeroInteractions`` was an alias for ``verifyNoMoreInteractions`` (sic!).
  - All `verify*` functions now warn you if you pass in an object which was never stubbed.
 * changes in version 1.0.0 - 1.0.5
  - mockito's strict mode is far more strict than before
  - ``mock``, ``when``, ``verify`` return mostly empty objects. It is unlikely to have a method_name clash.
  - ``Mock()`` is now an implementation detail; it is **not** exported anymore. Use ``mock()``.
 * changes in version 0.7.1:
  - bugfixes
 * changes in version 0.7.0:
  - bugfixes
 * changes in version 0.6.1:
  - Added ``thenAnswer(callable)``. The callable will be called to compute the answer the stubbed method will return. For that it will receive the arguments of the caller.
 * changes in version 0.6.0:
  - Breaking change: Throw early when calling not expected methods in strict mode.
 * changes in version 0.5.3:
  - Remove hard coded distribute setup files.
- Remove no longer needed patch python-mockito-0.5.2-setup.py.patch
