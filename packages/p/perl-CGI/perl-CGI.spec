%description
CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and
preparing HTTP requests and responses. Major features including processing
form submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string
generation and manipulation, and processing and preparing HTTP headers.

CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also comes
with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as FastCGI.

It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years with input
from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands of websites.
CGI.pm was included in the perl distribution from perl v5.4 to v5.20,
however is has now been removed from the perl core...
