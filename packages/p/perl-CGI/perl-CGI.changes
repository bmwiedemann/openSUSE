        This has been done in a way to ensure any $MultipartBuffer package

        explicitly using MultipartBuffer in a form such as:
  
          MultipartBuffer->new
  
        your code will break. you should be calling:
  
          CGI->new->new_MultipartBuffer( $boundary,$length );
  
        to ensure the correctly package is called. if you are extending the
        MultipartBuffer package though use of ISA or base (or parent) then you
        will need to update your code to use CGI::MultipartBuffer

- fixed build-dependencies

- updated to 4.14

    [ RELEASE NOTES ]
    - This release removes the AUTOLOAD and compile optimisations from CGI.pm
      that were introduced into CGI.pm twenty (20) years ago as a response to
      its large size, which meant there was a significant compile time penalty.

    - This optimisation is no longer relevant and makes the code difficult to
      deal with as well as making test coverage metrics incorrect. Benchmarks
      show that advantages of AUTOLOAD / lazy loading / deferred compile are
      less than 0.05s, which will be dwarfed by just about any meaningful code
      in a cgi script. If this is an issue for you then you should look at
      running CGI.pm in a persistent environment (FCGI, etc)

    - To offset some of the time added by removing the AUTOLOAD functionality
      the dependencies have been made runtime rather than compile time. The
      POD has also been split into its own file. CGI.pm now contains around
      4000 lines of code, which compared to some modules on CPAN isn't really
      that much

    - This essentially deprecates the -compile pragma and ->compile method. The
      -compile pragma will no longer do anything, whereas the ->compile method
      will raise a deprecation warning. More importantly this also REMOVES the
      -any pragma because as per the documentation this pragma needed to be
      "used with care or not at all" and allowing arbitrary HTML tags is almost
      certainly a bad idea. If you are using the -any pragma and using arbitrary
      tags (or have typo's in your code) your code will *BREAK*

    - Although this release should be back compatible (with the exception of any
      code using the -any pragma) you are encouraged to test it throughly as if
      you are doing anything out of the ordinary with CGI.pm (i.e. have bugs
      that may have been masked by the AUTOLOAD feature) you may see some issues.

    - References: GH #162, GH #137, GH #164

- updated to 4.13

[ RELEASE NOTES ]
    - CGI::Pretty is now DEPRECATED and will be removed in a future release.
      Please see GH #162 (https://github.com/leejo/CGI.pm/issues/162) for more
      information and discussion (also GH #140 for HTML function deprecation
      discussion: https://github.com/leejo/CGI.pm/issues/140)

      exported by the HTML::Entities module (GH #157)
    - change BUILD_REQUIRES to TEST_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL as these are test
      dependencies not build dependencies (GH #159)

    [ SPEC / BUG FIXES ]
    - favour -content-type arg in header if -type and -charset options are also
      passed in (GH #155, thanks to kaoru for the test case). this change also
      sorts the hash keys in the rearrange method in CGI::Util meaning the order
      of the arrangement will always be the same for params that have multiple
      aliases. really you shouldn't be passing in multiple aliases, but this will
      make it consistent should you do that

    [ RELEASE NOTES ]
    - with this release the large backlog of issues against CGI.pm has been
      cleared. All fixes have been made in the versions 4.00 and above so if
      you are upgrading from 3.* you should thoroughly test your code against
      recent versions of CGI.pm
    - an effort has been made to retain back compatibility against previous
      versions of CGI.pm for any fixes made, however some changes related to
      the handling of temporary files may have consequences for your code
    - please refer to the RELEASE NOTES for version 4.00 and above for all
      recent changes and file an issue on github if there has been a regression.
    - please do *NOT* file issues regarding HTML generating functions, these
      are no longer being maintained (see perldoc for rationale)

      charset force numeric encoding of all characters, because that does not
      happen

      of multi_param()
 
    [ SPEC / BUG FIXES ]
    - don't sub out PATH_INFO in url if PATH_INFO is the same as SCRIPT_NAME

      without having to disable the $LIST_CONTEXT_WARN flag (see RELEASE NOTES
      for version 4.05 on why calling param() in list context could be a bad

    - don't set binmode on STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN if a none standard layer
      is already set on them on none UNIX platforms (RT #57524)
    - make XForms:Model data accesible through POSTDATA/PUTDATA param
      (RT #75628)

    [ RELEASE NOTES ]
    - this release removes some long deprecated modules/functions and
      includes refactoring to the temporary file handling in CGI.pm. if
      you are doing anything out of the ordinary with regards to temp
      files you should test your code before deploying this update as
      temp files may no longer be stored in previously used locations
 
    [ REMOVED / DEPRECATIONS ]
    - startform and endform methods removed (previously deprecated, you
      should be using the start_form and end_form methods)
    - both CGI::Apache and CGI::Switch have been removed as these modules
      1) have been deprecated for *years*, and 2) do nothing whatsoever
 
    [ SPEC / BUG FIXES ]
    - handle multiple values in X-Forwarded-Host header, we follow the
      logic in most other frameworks and take the last value from the list
      (RT #54487)
    - reverse the order of TEMP dir placement for WINDOWS: TEMP > TMP > WINDIR
      (RT #71799, thanks to jeff@math.tntech.edu), this returns the behaviour
      to pre e24d04e9bc5fda7722444b02fec135d8cc2ff488 but with the undefined
      fix still in place
    - refactor CGITempFile::find_tempdir to use File::Spec->tmpdir
      (related: RT #71799)
    - fix warnings when QUERY_STRING has empty key=value pairs (RT #54511)
    - pad custom 500 status response messages to > 512 for MSIE (RT #81946)
    - make Vars tied hash delete method return the value deleted from the hash
      making it act like perl's delete (RT #51020)
 
    [ TESTING ]
    - add .travis.yml (https://travis-ci.org)
    - test case for RT #53966 - disallow filenames with ~ char
    - test case for RT #55166 - calling Vars to get the filename does not return
      a filehandle, so this cannot be used in the call to uploadinfo, also
      update documentation for the uploadInfo to show that ->Vars should not be
      used to get the filename for this method
    - fix t/url.t to pass on Win32 platforms that have the SCRIPT_NAME env
      variable set (RT #89992)
    - add procedural call tests for upload and uploadInfo to confirm these work
      as should (RT #91136)
 
    [ DOCUMENTATION ]
    - tweak perldoc for -utf8 option (RT #54341, thanks to Helmut Richter)
    - explain the HTML generation functions should no longer be used and that
      they may be deprecated in a future release
 
4.03 2014-07-02
 
    [ REMOVED / DEPRECATIONS ]
    - the -multiple option to popup_menu is now IGNORED as this did not
      function correctly. If you require a menu with multiple selections
      use the scrolling_list method. (RT #30057)
 
    [ SPEC / BUG FIXES ]
    - support redirects in mod_perl2, or fall back to using env variable
      for up to 5 redirects, when getting the query string (RT #36312)
    - CGI::Cookie now correctly supports the -max-age argument, previously
      if this was passed the value of the -expires argument would be used
      meaning there was no way to supply *only* this argument (RT #50576)
    - make :all actually import all methods, except for :cgi-lib, and add
      :ssl to the :standard import (RT #70337)
 
    [ DOCUMENTATION ]
    - clarify documentation regarding query_string method (RT #48370)
    - links fixed in some perldoc (Thanks to Michiel Beijen)
 
    [ TESTING ]
    - add t/changes.t for testing this Changes file
    - test case for RT #31107 confirming multipart parsing is to spec
    - improve t/rt-52469.t by adding a timeout check

- update to 3.63
  * CR escaping for Set-Cookie and P3P headers was improved. There was potential
    for newline injection in these headers. 

- changes from 3.62: 
  - Changed how the  deprecated endform function was defined for compatibilty
    with the development version of Perl. 
   Fix failures in t/tmpdir.t when run as root
    https://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/issues/22, RT#80659)

   Made it possible to force a sorted order for things like hash
    attributes so that tests are not dependent on a particular hash
    ordering. This will be required in modern perls which will
    change the ordering per process. (Yves, RT#80659)

- update to 3.57:
  * Test::More requirement has been bumped to 0.98

- changes from 3.56:
  * SECURITY: use public and documented FCGI.pm API in CGI::Fast: CGI::Fast was
    using an FCGI API that was deprecated and removed from documentation more

Tue Aug 23 15:03:43 UTC 2011 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 3.55:
  + [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
    url() was fixed to return "PATH_INFO" when it is explicitly requested
    with either the path=>1 or path_info=>1 flag.
    If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are 
    calling self_url() or you are calling url() and passing path_info=>1, 
    These methods will actually be returning PATH_INFO now, as you have 
    explicitly requested, or has self_url() has requested on your behalf.
  
    The PATH_INFO has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was 
    introduced in the 3.12 release in December, 2005. 
     
    This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or
    workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.
  + The DELETE HTTP verb is now supported (RT#52614)
  + [NEW FEATURES]
    - A new option to set $CGI::Carp::TO_BROWSER = 0, allows you to 
      explicitly exclude a particular scope from triggering printing to 
      the browser when fatatlsToBrowser is set. (RT#62783)
    - The <script> tag now supports the "charset" attribute.
      (RT#62907)
    - In CGI::Cookie, "Max-Age" is now supported for better 
      spec compliance.
  + Further improvements have been made to guard against newline
    injections in headers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 24 21:15:30 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 3.50:
  * Fixed two security issues: 
  ** The MIME boundary in multipart_init is now random.
  ** Further improvements to handling of newlines embedded in header 
     values. An exception is thrown if header values contain 
     invalid newlines.
  * Correcting/clarifying documentation for param_fetch().
  * Fixing https test in http.t.
  * Tests were added for multipart_init().
