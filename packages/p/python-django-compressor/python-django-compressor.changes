-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 08:39:13 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.3:
- *Backward incompatible changes*

  -  Dropped support for Python 2.5. Removed ``any`` and ``walk`` compatibility 
     functions in ``compressor.utils``.
  
  - Removed compatibility with Django 1.2 for default values of some settings:

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_ROOT` no longer uses ``MEDIA_ROOT`` if ``STATIC_ROOT`` is
      not defined. It expects ``STATIC_ROOT`` to be defined instead.

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_URL` no longer uses ``MEDIA_URL`` if ``STATIC_URL`` is
      not defined. It expects ``STATIC_URL`` to be defined instead.

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND` no longer uses ``CACHE_BACKEND`` and simply 
      defaults to ``default``.

- Added precompiler class support. This enables you to write custom precompilers
  with Python logic in them instead of just relying on executables.

- Made CssAbsoluteFilter smarter: it now handles URLs with hash fragments or
  querystring correctly. In addition, it now leaves alone fragment-only URLs.

- Removed a ``fsync()`` call in ``CompilerFilter`` to improve performance.
  We already called ``self.infile.flush()`` so that call was not necessary.

- Added an extension to provide django-sekizai support. 
  See :ref:`django-sekizai Support <django-sekizai_support>` for more 
  information.
- Fixed a ``DeprecationWarning`` regarding the use of ``django.utils.hashcompat``
- Updated bundled ``rjsmin.py`` to fix some JavaScript compression errors.

Tue Nov 13 22:47:11 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 1.2:
  * Added compatibility with Django 1.4 and dropped support for Django 1.2.X.
  * Added contributing docs. Be sure to check them out and start contributing!
  * Moved CI to Travis: http://travis-ci.org/jezdez/django_compressor
  * Introduced a new compressed context dictionary that is passed to the
    templates that are responsible for rendering the compressed snippets.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change if you've overridden any of the included templates:
      compressor/css_file.html
      compressor/css_inline.html
      compressor/js_file.html
      compressor/js_inline.html
    The variables passed to those templates have been namespaced in a
    dictionary, so it's easy to fix your own templates.
    For example, the old compressor/js_file.html:
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url }}"></script>
    The new compressor/js_file.html:
      <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ compressed.url }}"></script>
  * Removed old templates named compressor/css.html and compressor/js.html
    that were originally left for backwards compatibility. If you've
    overridden them, just rename them to compressor/css_file.html or
    compressor/js_file.html and make sure you've accounted for the backwards
    incompatible change of the template context mentioned above.
  * Reverted an unfortunate change to the YUI filter that prepended
    'java -jar' to the binary name, which doesn't alway work, e.g. if the YUI
    compressor is shipped as a script like /usr/bin/yui-compressor.
  * Changed the sender parameter of the post_compress() signal to be either
    compressor.css.CssCompressor or compressor.js.JsCompressor for easier
    customization.
  * Correctly handle offline compressing files that are found in {% if %}
    template blocks.
  * Renamed the second option for the COMPRESS_CSS_HASHING_METHOD setting from
    'hash' to 'content' to better describe what it does. The old name is also
    supported, as well as the default being 'mtime'.
  * Fixed CssAbsoluteFilter, src attributes in includes now get transformed.
  * Added a new hook to allow developers to completely bypass offline
    compression in CompressorNode subclasses: is_offline_compression_enabled.
  * Dropped versiontools from required dependencies again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 13:26:25 UTC 2012 - saschpe@suse.de

  * Simplified macro usage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 19:03:33 UTC 2012 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 1.1.2:
  * Fixed an installation issue related to versiontools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 26 06:01:29 UTC 2011 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 1.1.1:
  - Fixed a stupid ImportError bug introduced in 1.1
  - Fixed Jinja2 docs of since JINJA2_EXTENSIONS expects a class, not a module
  - Fixed a Windows bug with regard to file resolving with staticfiles finders
  - Stopped a potential memory leak when memoizing the rendered output
  - Fixed the integration between staticfiles (e.g. in Django <= 1.3.1) and
    compressor which prevents the collectstatic management command to work
  - Warning - Make sure to remove the path method of your custom remote
    storage class!
- 1.1:
  - Made offline compression completely independent from cache (by writing a
    manifest.json file)
  - You can now easily run the compress management command locally and
    transfer the COMPRESS_ROOT dir to your server
  - Updated installation instructions to properly mention all dependencies,
    even those internally used
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0 which would prevent the proper deactivation
    of the compression in production
  - Added a Jinja2 contrib extension
  - Made sure the rel attribute of link tags can be mixed case
  - Avoid overwriting context variables needed for compressor to work
  - Stopped the compress management command to require model validation
  - Added missing imports and fixed a few PEP 8 issues
- 1.0.1:
  - Fixed regression in compressor.utils.staticfiles compatibility module
- 1.0:
  - BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE Stopped swallowing exceptions raised by rendering
    the template tag in production (DEBUG = False). This has the potential to
    breaking lots of apps but on the other hand will help find bugs
  - BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE The default function to create the cache key
    stopped containing the server hostname. Instead the cache key now only has
    the form 'django_compressor.<KEY>'
  - To revert to the previous way simply set the COMPRESS_CACHE_KEY_FUNCTION
    to 'compressor.cache.socket_cachekey'
  - BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE Renamed ambigously named COMPRESS_DATA_URI_MAX_SIZE
    setting to COMPRESS_DATA_URI_MAX_SIZE. It’s the maximum size the
    compressor.filters.datauri.DataUriFilter filter will embed files as data:
    URIs
  - Added COMPRESS_CSS_HASHING_METHOD setting with the options 'mtime'
    (default) and 'hash' for the CssAbsoluteFilter filter. The latter uses the
    content of the file to calculate the cache-busting hash
  - Added support for {{ block.super }} to compress management command
  - Dropped Django 1.1.X support
  - Fixed compiler filters on Windows
  - Handle new-style cached template loaders in the compress management
    command
  - Documented included filters
  - Added Slim It filter
  - Added new CallbackOutputFilter to ease the implementation of Python-based
    callback filters that only need to pass the content to a callable
  - Make use of django-appconf for settings handling and versiontools for
    versions
  - Uses the current context when rendering the render templates
  - Added post_compress signal
