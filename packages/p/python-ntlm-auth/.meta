  <title>NTLM low-level Python library</title>
  <description>This library handles the low-level details of NTLM authentication for
use in authenticating with a service that uses NTLM. It will create
and parse the 3 different message types in the order required and
produce a base64 encoded value that can be attached to the HTTP
header.

The goal of this library is to offer full NTLM support including
signing and sealing of messages as well as supporting MIC for message
integrity and the ability to customise and set limits on the messages
sent.
