- Update to version 1.1.0
  + quoted data urls which are not base64 encoded keep their spaces now (#8)
  + Add x86_64, i686 and aarch64 wheels
  + Update python support: 2.7, 3.6+
  + Both python 2 and 3 now accept bytes and text as input. All other types now
    raise a TypeError. Before they possibly have been converted to a string,
    depending on the python version and the implementation. Python 3 also
    accepts bytearray input.
  + Support for PyPy and Jython is no longer tested. Patches are accepted,
    though.
  + The python version will only accept the C implementation if the versions
    match exactly. This should prevent using older installed C versions.
    Fixes #11. This issue is now more relevant since #7 is fixed.
  + Minor adaptions for GCC 8
  + Docs are no longer installed locally.
  + Rework the setup and project management system. Add some real tests. Get rid
    of epydoc in favor of sphinx. Adapt to latest sphinx version.
