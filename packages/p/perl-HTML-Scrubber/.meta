  <title>Perl extension for scrubbing/sanitizing html</title>
  <description>If you wanna &quot;scrub&quot; or &quot;sanitize&quot; html input in a reliable and flexible
fashion, then this module is for you.

I wasn't satisfied with HTML::Sanitizer because it is based on
HTML::TreeBuilder, so I thought I'd write something similar that works
directly with HTML::Parser.</description>
