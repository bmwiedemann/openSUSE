- updated to 0.22
      - Fix issues where the metaclass gets reinitialized after the call to
        'extends' but before 'make_immutable'. This could happen if a role
        used an extension which provided an application_to_class metarole,
        since the role application would then apply a metarole to the class,
        and metarole application currently causes metaclass reinitialization
        in Moose. (ugh.)

- updated to 0.21
        - Allow this module to work with constructors with names other than
          'new'. If you're extending a class with a constructor named something
          other than 'new', you should declare this when calling extends, as in:
  
            extends 'Foo' => { -constructor_name => 'create' };
  
          This will ensure that calling 'create' will also call Moose's
          constructor.
  
        - fix warning when passing inline_constructor => 0 with no superclass new
          method (rafl).
  
        - don't die if superclass doesn't have a 'new' method
  
        - forward compat for Moose 2.0
