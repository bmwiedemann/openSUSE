  <title>Easy subclassing of non-Moose classes</title>
  <description>&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot; allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this, such
as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and installing (and
inlining, at &quot;make_immutable&quot; time) a constructor that makes sure things
like &quot;BUILD&quot; methods are called.
