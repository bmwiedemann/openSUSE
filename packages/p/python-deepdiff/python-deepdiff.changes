- Skip test failing on Python 3.13

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 23:03:15 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 8.0.1:
  * With the introduction of `threshold_to_diff_deeper`, the
    values returned are different than in previous versions of
    DeepDiff. You can still get the older values by setting
    `threshold_to_diff_deeper=0`. However to signify that enough
    has changed in this release that the users need to update the
    parameters passed to DeepDiff, we will be doing a major
    version update.
  * [x] `use_enum_value=True` makes it so when diffing enum, we
    use the enum's value. It makes it so comparing an enum to a
    string or any other value is not reported as a type change.
  * [x] `threshold_to_diff_deeper=float` is a number between 0
    and 1. When comparing dictionaries that have a small
    intersection of keys, we will report the dictionary as a
    `new_value` instead of reporting individual keys changed. If
    you set it to zero, you get the same results as DeepDiff
    7.0.1 and earlier, which means this feature is disabled. The
    new default is 0.33 which means if less that one third of
    keys between dictionaries intersect, report it as a new
    object.
  * [x] Deprecated `ordered-set` and switched to `orderly-set`.
    The `ordered-set` package was not being maintained anymore
    and starting Python 3.6, there were better options for sets
    that ordered. I forked one of the new implementations,
    modified it, and published it as `orderly-set`.
  * [x] Added `use_log_scale:bool` and
    `log_scale_similarity_threshold:float`. They can be used to
    ignore small changes in numbers by comparing their
    differences in logarithmic space. This is different than
    ignoring the difference based on significant digits.
  * [x] json serialization of reversed lists.
  * [x] Fix for iterable moved items when `iterable_compare_func`
    is used.
  * [x] Pandas and Polars support.

Sat Apr 20 13:56:16 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.0.1:
  * When verbose=2, return `new_path` when the `path` and
    `new_path` are different (for example when ignore_order=True
    and the index of items have changed).
  * Dropping support for Python 3.7
  * Introducing serialize to flat rows for delta objects.
  * fixes the issue with hashing `datetime.date` objects
    where it treated them as numbers instead of dates (fixes
    #445).
  * upgrading orjson to the latest version
  * Fix for bug when diffing two lists with ignore_order and
    providing compare_func
  * Supporting Python 3.12 in the build process by Leo Sin
  * Include type info and change the "unknown" value for flat
    rows to something that is friendly for Postgres enums

    quotes in keys`
