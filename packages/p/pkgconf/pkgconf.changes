Fri Oct  3 14:16:40 UTC 2025 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.5.1:
  + Fix processing of empty dependency lists.
- Changes from version 2.5.0:
  + Added a manual page for bomtool.
  + Add support for preloaded packages.
  + Refactor Windows registry PKG_CONFIG_PATH support so that it
    augments the main directory search list instead of being
    treated as a special case.
  + Processing of `--with-path` arguments by the pkgconf CLI is
    now deferred until libpkgconf is fully initialized, effectively
    aligning behavior with PKG_CONFIG_PATH processing.
  + Fix several minor memory safety bugs which were identified by
    the GCC 15 static analyzer.
  + Added support for pledge(2) and unveil(2) on systems where
    this functionality is available.
  + Significant improvements to pkgconf's manual pages.
  + Remove questionable default-static assumption on Windows that
    was inherited from the original pkg-config.  Most distributions
    of pkgconf on Windows were already patching this out.
  + Add -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L to the build definitions, which
    is needed for readlinkat on glibc.
- Changes from version 2.4.3:
  + Fix additional logic errors relating to the new fragment trees
    functionality.
- Changes from version 2.4.2:
  + Fix several logic errors in the pkg-config file parser that
    were surfaced by recent refactoring work.
  + Fix BSD make compatibility so that it generates the test data
    before running kyua on BSD make implementations.
- Changes from version 2.4.1:
  + Ensure the full DAG is solved for all query types.
- Changes from version 2.4.0:
  + Allow multiple package names in solution-based queries such as
    `--print-requires`, `--print-requires-private` and
    `--print-provides`.
  + Use `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` where appropriate on Meson.
  + Add an abstract buffer type and use it when loading files from
    disk instead of a 64KB buffer.  This ensures large pkg-config
    files are not truncated.
  + Disable graph recursion in `--variable` queries as it was
    generating duplicate output.
  + Add infrastructure for tracking fragment group relations and
    convert storage of fragments to use a tree-like structure
    instead of string concatenation.
  + Add support for tracking linker groups, e.g.
    -Wl,--start-group -la -lb -lc -Wl,--end-group
    as fragment groups.
  + Properly contextualize the sysroot directory when processing
    package information, ensuring packages where ${pc_sysrootdir}
    does not match the default are properly processed.
- Changes from version 2.3.0:
  + Fix compile with Meson on Solaris by defining __EXTENSIONS__.
  + Add support for the PKG_CONFIG_RELOCATE_PATHS environmental
    variable. When set, the program will act as if --define-prefix
    is always enabled.
  + Color solution nodes that were part of the original query, and
    use that coloring to skip over dependencies when generating
    DocumentNames in bomtool.
  + Enhance --env option to support variables with both
    --variable=varname and --print-variables.
  + Add --exists-cflags option which creates synthetic preprocessor
    definition flags for every queried dependency when found.
  + Document that Requires.private is always used for header paths.
  + Fix minor documentation typos.
  + Ensure string comparisons using <ctype.h> functions are done
    with unsigned bytes to avoid undefined behavior.
  + Fix parsing edge-case bugs with dependency versions.
  + Change PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG autoconf macro to add a customizable
    failure handler if pkg-config is not found.

Sat May 25 09:28:03 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 2.2.0:
  * Significant solver rework to flatten both requires and
    requires.private dependencies in a single pass.  Improves
    performance slightly and ensures proper dependency order.
  * Improve --digraph output to reflect more of the solver's state
    in the rendered dependency graph.
  * Do not reference the graph root by name when presenting error
    messages about directly requested dependency nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    which avoids revisiting already visited nodes
  * Add a regression test to check that the dependency flattener is
    working as expected

    to specify that static linking should be used by default.
  + Support for the PKG_CONFIG_MSVC_SYNTAX environment variable has
    been added.  Patch by Dan Kegel.
  + Support for the PKGCONF_PKG_PKGF_DONT_MERGE_SPECIAL_FRAGMENTS

  + Fixed a memory leak when deduplicating paths.
  + Fixed strndup-related build regression on Windows.
  + Added --modversion description to pkgconf(1) man page.
  + Properly tokenize versions. Versions cannot logically contain

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  1 12:32:54 UTC 2019 - Neal Gompa <ngompa13@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.6.1
  + Fixed an issue where a personality may not be properly selected
    due to argv[0] containing a full path.
  + Fixed a regression where having an empty PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
    environment variable would not eliminate the default search
    paths.
  + Use POSIX realpath(3) instead of readlink() for deduplicating the
    search path.  Use _fullpath() on Windows for the same purpose.
  + The dequoting logic for tuples has been improved to ensure that
    quotes *inside* a value remain quoted when necessary.
  + Fixed issue where packages which referenced missing packages in
    Requires.private may have crashed due to memory corruption issues
    in some circumstances.
  + Fixed warnings reported by GCC 8 diagnostics.
  + Add LIBPKGCONF_VERSION and LIBPKGCONF_VERSION_STR macros for
    determining libpkgconf version.
  + Add pkgconf_fragment_copy_list() to copy a fragment list to
    another fragment list.
  + Fix edge cases for path canonicalization (especially on Windows)

  + Fix edge cases involving dequoting zero-length tuples that can lead to a
    buffer overflow under the right circumstances.  Thanks to A. Wilcox for
    reporting and supplying a patch. (boo#1105438 - CVE-2018-1000221) 
  + Ensure environment variables override values learned from personality files
    or built-in defaults.
  + Add pkgconf-personality(5) manpage documenting the personality file format.
- Drop BR pkgconfig and manually specified pkgconfig() Provides for
  devel subpackage to avoid dependency loops.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 20 10:51:58 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.5.1
  - fixed a crash with some invalid multi-line .pc files

- Update to version 1.5.0
  - pkgconf now supports the proposed Requires.internal pkg-config extension,
    by merging it with the Requires.private list (there is no functional difference
    between the two in our resolver implementation)
  - Support for cross-compilation personalities have been added.  To make use of this
    functionality, create a file in the new personality.d directory that sits inside
    the pkgconfig directory.  The personality file format is described in
    pc-personality(5).
  - Support for Haiku has been added, including interpretation of BELIBRARIES and
    other toolchain specifics.
  - tuples are now appropriately dequoted when added by the parser
- Applied spec-cleaner

      when satisfied by an indirect provider (gh#pkgconf/pkgconf#172)
    - revert some quoting changes because they don't work well
      with certain GCC edge cases (gh#pkgconf/pkgconf#168)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
