Sat May 25 09:28:03 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 2.2.0:
  * Significant solver rework to flatten both requires and
    requires.private dependencies in a single pass.  Improves
    performance slightly and ensures proper dependency order.
  * Improve --digraph output to reflect more of the solver's state
    in the rendered dependency graph.
  * Do not reference the graph root by name when presenting error
    messages about directly requested dependency nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Reintroduce an optimization to the dependency graph walker
    which avoids revisiting already visited nodes
  * Add a regression test to check that the dependency flattener is
    working as expected

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Fix a possible out of boundary access in the parser for the
    cross-compile database.  Patch by Tobias Stöckmann.
  + Missing files for building with Meson are now included in the

    configuration option have been added.  This allows for toolchains
    to specify that static linking should be used by default.
  + Support for the PKG_CONFIG_MSVC_SYNTAX environment variable has
    been added.  Patch by Dan Kegel.
  + Support for the PKGCONF_PKG_PKGF_DONT_MERGE_SPECIAL_FRAGMENTS
    client flag which disables emulation of freedesktop.org pkg-config
    fragment merging semantics has been added.
    Patch by Karen Arutyunov.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 09:35:34 UTC 2019 - Neal Gompa <ngompa13@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.6.3
  + Fixed a memory leak when deduplicating paths.
  + Fixed strndup-related build regression on Windows.
  + Added --modversion description to pkgconf(1) man page.
  + Properly tokenize versions. Versions cannot logically contain
    whitespace, as dependency-lists would not properly tokenize if
    they could. A diagnostic is generated for malformed version
    strings containing whitespace when --validate is used.

Wed May  1 12:32:54 UTC 2019 - Neal Gompa <ngompa13@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.6.1
  + Fixed an issue where a personality may not be properly selected
    due to argv[0] containing a full path.
  + Fixed a regression where having an empty PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
    environment variable would not eliminate the default search
    paths.
  + Use POSIX realpath(3) instead of readlink() for deduplicating the
    search path.  Use _fullpath() on Windows for the same purpose.
  + The dequoting logic for tuples has been improved to ensure that
    quotes *inside* a value remain quoted when necessary.
  + Fixed issue where packages which referenced missing packages in
    Requires.private may have crashed due to memory corruption issues
    in some circumstances.
  + Fixed warnings reported by GCC 8 diagnostics.
  + Add LIBPKGCONF_VERSION and LIBPKGCONF_VERSION_STR macros for
    determining libpkgconf version.
  + Add pkgconf_fragment_copy_list() to copy a fragment list to
    another fragment list.
  + Fix edge cases for path canonicalization (especially on Windows)
- Add personality.d directories for cross-targets
- Add pkgconf rpm macros for pkgconf directories
- Simplify platform-pkg-config wrapper to work with POSIX sh

- Update to 1.5.3
  + Fix edge cases involving dequoting zero-length tuples that can lead to a
    buffer overflow under the right circumstances.  Thanks to A. Wilcox for
    reporting and supplying a patch. (boo#1105438 - CVE-2018-1000221) 
  + Ensure environment variables override values learned from personality files
    or built-in defaults.
  + Add pkgconf-personality(5) manpage documenting the personality file format.
- Drop BR pkgconfig and manually specified pkgconfig() Provides for
  devel subpackage to avoid dependency loops.

Wed Jun 20 10:51:58 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.5.1
  - fixed a crash with some invalid multi-line .pc files

- Update to version 1.5.0
  - pkgconf now supports the proposed Requires.internal pkg-config extension,
    by merging it with the Requires.private list (there is no functional difference
    between the two in our resolver implementation)
  - Support for cross-compilation personalities have been added.  To make use of this
    functionality, create a file in the new personality.d directory that sits inside
    the pkgconfig directory.  The personality file format is described in
    pc-personality(5).
  - Support for Haiku has been added, including interpretation of BELIBRARIES and
    other toolchain specifics.
  - tuples are now appropriately dequoted when added by the parser
- Applied spec-cleaner

      with certain GCC edge cases (gh#pkgconf/pkgconf#168)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
