- Remove  python-Flask-SQLAlchemy-no-mock.patch merged upstream
- Update to v3.0.2
  * Update compatibility with SQLAlchemy 2.
- from v3.0.1
  * Export typing information instead of using external typeshed definitions.
  * If default engine options are set, but SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI is not set,
    an invalid default bind will not be configured.
- from v3.0.0
  * Drop support for Python 2, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
  * Bump minimum version of Flask to 2.2.
  * Bump minimum version of SQLAlchemy to 1.4.18.
  * Remove previously deprecated code.
  * The session is scoped to the current app context instead of the thread.
    This requires that an app context is active. This ensures that the
    session is cleaned up after every request.
  * An active Flask application context is always required to access session
    and engine, regardless of if an application was passed to the constructor.
  * Different bind keys use different SQLAlchemy MetaData registries,
    allowing tables in different databases to have the same name.
    Bind keys are stored and looked up on the resulting metadata rather
    than the model or table.
  * SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI does not default to sqlite:///:memory:.
    An error is raised if neither it nor SQLALCHEMY_BINDS define any engines.
  * Configuring SQLite with a relative path is relative to app.instance_path
    instead of app.root_path. The instance folder is created if necessary.
  * Added get_or_404, first_or_404, one_or_404, and paginate methods to the
    extension object. These use SQLAlchemy's preferred session.execute(select())
    pattern instead of the legacy query interface.
  * Setup methods that create the engines and session are renamed with a
    leading underscore. They are considered internal interfaces which may
    change at any time.
  * All parameters to SQLAlchemy except app are keyword-only.
  * Renamed the bind parameter to bind_key and removed the app parameter
    from various SQLAlchemy methods.
  * The extension object uses __getattr__ to alias names from the SQLAlchemy
    package, rather than copying them as attributes.
  * The extension object is stored directly as app.extensions["sqlalchemy"].
  * The session class can be customized by passing the class_ key in the session_options parameter.
  * SignallingSession is renamed to Session.
  * Session.get_bind more closely matches the base implementation.
  * Model classes and the db instance are available without imports in flask shell.
  * The CamelCase to snake_case table name converter handles more patterns correctly.
    If model that was already created in the database changed, either use Alembic
    to rename the table, or set __tablename__ to keep the old name.
  * Model repr distinguishes between transient and pending instances.
  * A custom model class can implement __init_subclass__ with class parameters.
  * db.Table is a subclass instead of a function.
  * The engine_options parameter is applied as defaults before per-engine configuration.
  * SQLALCHEMY_BINDS values can either be an engine URL, or a dict of engine options
    including URL, for each bind. SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS
    correspond to the None key and take precedence.
  * Engines are created when calling init_app rather than the first time they are accessed.
  * db.engines exposes the map of bind keys to engines for the current app.
  * get_engine, get_tables_for_bind, and get_binds are deprecated.
  * SQLite driver-level URIs that look like sqlite:///file:name.db?uri=true are supported.
  * SQLite engines do not use NullPool if pool_size is 0.
  * MySQL engines use the "utf8mb4" charset by default.
  * MySQL engines do not set pool_size to 10.
  * MySQL engines don't set a default for pool_recycle if not using a queue pool.
  * Query is renamed from BaseQuery.
  * Added Query.one_or_404.
  * The query class is applied to backref in relationship.
  * Creating Pagination objects manually is no longer a public API.
    They should be created with db.paginate or query.paginate.
  * Pagination.iter_pages and Query.paginate parameters are keyword-only.
  * Pagination is iterable, iterating over its items.
  * Pagination count query is more efficient.
  * Pagination.iter_pages is more efficient.
  * Pagination.iter_pages right_current parameter is inclusive.
  * Pagination per_page cannot be 0.
  * Pagination max_per_page defaults to 100.
  * Added Pagination.first and last properties, which give the
    number of the first and last item on the page.
  * SQLALCHEMY_RECORD_QUERIES is disabled by default, and is not
    enabled automatically with app.debug or app.testing.
  * get_debug_queries is renamed to get_recorded_queries
    to better match the config and functionality.
  * Recorded query info is a dataclass instead of a tuple.
    The context attribute is renamed to location.
    Finding the location uses a more inclusive check.
  * SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS is disabled by default.
  * SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN is deprecated. It can cause various
    design issues that are difficult to debug. Call db.session.commit() directly instead.

- do not require python-mock for build
- added patches
  fix https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-sqlalchemy/commit/20864ddfe4f9b70f20d38e5dc3f8d49c1ca99207
  + python-Flask-SQLAlchemy-no-mock.patch

Thu Mar  3 11:35:08 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Work around test suite failure inside OBS: BuildRequire krb5.
  krb5 is a dependency to python (via tirpc), and inside OBS we get
  a slightly limited version of it as krb5-mini. The test suite of
  this package fails to pass with the mini flavor though. As -mini
  is never offered to actual users, we can get away with this
  workaround.

    when using polymorphic models. (#651)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 02:50:06 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 2.3.2:
  * Don't mask the parent table for single-table inheritance
    models. (#561)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 10 01:54:46 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * increased SQLAlchemy dependency to >= 0.8
  * changed from nose to pytest
  * added fdupes to remove some rpmlint warnings

- update to version 2.3.1:
  * If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the
    metadata, use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected
    tables were not picked up by models. (#551)
  * Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no
    primary key. (#556)
  * Fix repr on models that don't have an identity because they have
    not been flushed yet. (#555)
  * Allow specifying a max_per_page limit for pagination, to avoid
    users specifying high values in the request args. (#542)
  * For paginate with error_out=False, the minimum value for page is 1
    and per_page is 0. (#558)

- changes from version 2.3.0:
  * Multiple bugs with __tablename__ generation are fixed. Names will
    be generated for models that define a primary key, but not for
    single-table inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a
    declared_attr. PrimaryKeyConstraint is detected. (#541)
  * Passing an existing declarative_base() as model_class to
    SQLAlchemy.__init__ will use this as the base class instead of
    creating one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to
    construct the base. (#546)
  * The undocumented DeclarativeMeta internals that the extension uses
    for binds and table name generation have been refactored to work
    as mixins. Documentation is added about how to create a custom
    metaclass that does not do table name generation. (#546)
  * Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new models
    module. _BoundDeclarativeMeta is renamed to DefaultMeta; the old
    name will be removed in 3.0. (#546)
  * Models have a default repr that shows the model name and primary
    key. (#530)
  * Fixed a bug where using init_app would cause connectors to always
    use the current_app rather than the app they were created
    for. This caused issues when multiple apps were registered with
    the extension. (#547)

- changes from version 2.2:
  * Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of
    sqlalchemy.inspect.
  * Added support for custom query_class and model_class as args to
    the SQLAlchemy constructor. (#328)
  * Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on db.session. (#364)
  * Allow __bind_key__ on abstract models. (#373)
  * Allow SQLALCHEMY_ECHO to be a string. (#409)
  * Warn when SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI is not set. (#443)
  * Don't let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (#460)
  * Drop support of Flask < 0.10. This means the db session is always
    tied to the app context and its teardown event. (#461)
  * Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties
    unless they are declared_attr. (#467)
