    <version>2.3.2</version>

    <comment>- update to version 2.3.2:
  * Don't mask the parent table for single-table inheritance
    models. (#561)
- specfile:
  * increased SQLAlchemy dependency to &gt;= 0.8
  * changed from nose to pytest
  * added fdupes to remove some rpmlint warnings
- update to version 2.3.1:
  * If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the
    metadata, use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected
    tables were not picked up by models. (#551)
  * Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no
    primary key. (#556)
  * Fix repr on models that don't have an identity because they have
    not been flushed yet. (#555)
  * Allow specifying a max_per_page limit for pagination, to avoid
    users specifying high values in the request args. (#542)
  * For paginate with error_out=False, the minimum value for page is 1
    and per_page is 0. (#558)
- changes from version 2.3.0:
  * Multiple bugs with __tablename__ generation are fixed. Names will
    be generated for models that define a primary key, but not for
    single-table inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a
    declared_attr. PrimaryKeyConstraint is detected. (#541)
  * Passing an existing declarative_base() as model_class to
    SQLAlchemy.__init__ will use this as the base class instead of
    creating one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to
    construct the base. (#546)
  * The undocumented DeclarativeMeta internals that the extension uses
    for binds and table name generation have been refactored to work
    as mixins. Documentation is added about how to create a custom
    metaclass that does not do table name generation. (#546)
  * Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new models
    module. _BoundDeclarativeMeta is renamed to DefaultMeta; the old
    name will be removed in 3.0. (#546)
  * Models have a default repr that shows the model name and primary
    key. (#530)
  * Fixed a bug where using init_app would cause connectors to always
    use the current_app rather than the app they were created
    for. This caused issues when multiple apps were registered with
    the extension. (#547)
- changes from version 2.2:
  * Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of
    sqlalchemy.inspect.
  * Added support for custom query_class and model_class as args to
    the SQLAlchemy constructor. (#328)
  * Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on db.session. (#364)
  * Allow __bind_key__ on abstract models. (#373)
  * Allow SQLALCHEMY_ECHO to be a string. (#409)
  * Warn when SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI is not set. (#443)
  * Don't let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (#460)
  * Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always
    tied to the app context and its teardown event. (#461)
  * Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties
    unless they are declared_attr. (#467)
- convert to single spec
- update copyright
- Update to Version 2.1
  - Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
    subclassing mixins and abstract models.
  - Allow using a custom MetaData object.
  - Add support for binds parameter to session.
- Update to Version 2.0
  - Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
    sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
    not existing.
  - Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
  - Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
    for customizing session creation.
  - If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
    longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
  - Added working table reflection support.
  - Enabled autoflush by default.
  - Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
- Update to Version 1.0
  - Added Python 3.3 support.
  - Dropped 2.5 compatibility.
  - Various bugfixes
  - Changed versioning format to do major releases for each update now.
- Require python-setuptools instead of distribute (upstreams merged)
- Update to version 0.16:
  + New distribution format (flask_sqlalchemy)
  + Added support for Flask 0.9 specifics.
- Fix bnc#732325
- Update to version 0.15:

    <comment>- Work around test suite failure inside OBS: BuildRequire krb5.
  krb5 is a dependency to python (via tirpc), and inside OBS we get
  a slightly limited version of it as krb5-mini. The test suite of
  this package fails to pass with the mini flavor though. As -mini
  is never offered to actual users, we can get away with this
  workaround.
