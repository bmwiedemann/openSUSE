    <comment>Split python-tornado packages by version. tornado 5 is the version supported by the most packages, and the default. Some packages still only work with tornado 4. tornado 6 is the most recent version. Having split versions allows packages that depend on a particular version to still work.

This is the python-tornado version 4 package. This is will stop working with python 3.8, so it automatically disables python 3 builds for that version.</comment>

    <comment>- Replace %fdupes -s with plain %fdupes; hardlinks are better.

- Provide versioned python-tornado symbol, making this package a
  full option in case the meta package is not applicable.

- Per discussion with RM switch back to python-tornado&lt;version&gt;
  system with python-tornado standing in as a metapkg

- Provide also python-tornado symbol not just py2/py3-tornado

- Add tornado-impl provide to fix the collision for OBS resolver
  in dlpy before new python-torando containing version 6 is included
  in openSUSE TW

- Switch to pytest like approach for tornado
- Do not install tests

- Reduce the conflicts even more</comment>
