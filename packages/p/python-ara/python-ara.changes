Wed Apr  3 14:32:36 UTC 2024 - Markéta Machová <mmachova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.7.1
  * Address deprecation of yaml.dump in ruamel.yaml when generating
    the default server settings.yaml file (#524)
  * Don't use setuptools/pkg_resources to retrieve the version of ara
    since it is not always installed by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 25 14:02:22 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.7.0:
  * Update bootstrap CSS from 4.6.0 to 5.3.0 and fix broken layout
    and components as a result of the update
  * Removed separate light/dark themes via bootstrap-darkly and
    bootstrap-flatly: bootstrap 5.3 features a new built-in dark
    theme
  * Re-worked the dark/light theme selection to match the new
    bootstrap built-in dark theme including pygments highlighting
    for pretty-printed output
  * Removed jquery, it is no longer required with bootstrap
  * Re-worked implementation of file line highlighting since it
    relied on jquery
  * Fixed tooltip implementation (i.e, for task tags) since the
    implementation in bootstrap had changed
  * Large chunks of templating were moved out to partials/tables and
    partials/search in order to improve readability.
  * Round of template cleanups and fixes as reported by djlint
  * Will continue to be a work in progress to simplify and standardize
    templates.
  * Raised the requirement on django from >=3.2,<3.3 to >=3.2,<4.3 to
    allow installation with the latest LTS release of django.
   * Raised the requirement on python from >=3.6 to >=3.8 to accomodate
    django 4.2.
  * Ignored Django warning about the lack of a STATIC_ROOT directory.
    ara uses whitenoise for serving static files which makes the warning
    superfluous. (#492)

Tue Jul 18 15:42:54 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.1 (2022-12-12):
  - callback: Changed how ANSIBLE_TMP is found to work around a
    behavior change in ansible-core 2.14 that ended up creating a
    directory named {{ ANSIBLE_HOME ~ "
  - Added a mysql extra to the python packaging for installing
    the mysqlclient library. This is in addition to the existing
    server and postgresql extra. They are used like this: pip
    install ara[server,mysql,postgresql]
- Update 1.6.0 (2022-12-01):
  It features a new "tasks" page to browse and search for
  tasks across playbook runs as well as many updates, fixes and
  improvements.
  - UI
    - Added a new "Tasks" page similar to the existing pages
      for Playbooks and Hosts. It provides a browseable and
      searchable overview of tasks across playbook runs.
    - Refreshed the host index page:
      - Added a column as well as search arguments for playbook
        name (or path)
      - Replaced the playbook status by a concise summary of task
        status for the host
    - Updated the playbook summary card to include the playbook
      id, the version of ara as well as the version of python.

  - callback plugin
    - Added support for recording the user who ran the playbook
    - Added support for recording the version of ara as well as
      the version of python used when running the playbook
    - Added options ARA_RECORD_USER and ARA_RECORD_CONTROLLER
      that can be set to false to avoid recording the user and
      controller hostname
    - Added support for specifying a SSL key, certificate and
      certificate authority for authenticating with a remote ara
      API server using ARA_API_KEY, ARA_API_CERT and ARA_API_CA
      respectively.
    - Fixed host fact recording to ensure it works when using
      FQCN-style tasks (ex: setup & ansible.builtin.setup)
    - Increased reliability and accuracy when recording results
      that can arrive out of order when using multi-threading
      or the free strategy by using the task uuid provided by
      Ansible
    - Truncate playbook, play, host and label names in
      circumstances where their length exceeds 255 characters
    - Ignore and don't record files in ~/.ansible/tmp by default
  - API Server
    - Bumped django requirement from 2.2 LTS to 3.2 LTS and
      removed the pin on the version of psycopg2 accordingly
    - Added a new configuration option, ARA_BASE_PATH, to let
      the server listen on an alternate path. It will continue
      to default to "/" but it could, for example, be set to
      "/ara/".
    - Lifted requirement on tzlocal, improve timezone detection
      and mitigate when the timezone can't be found by defaulting
      to UTC
  - Several new database model and API fields:
    - Added client_version and server_version fields to
      playbooks, meant to represent the version of the ara
      callback and server used in recording the playbook
    - Added python_version field to playbooks to save the version
      of python used by Ansible and the callback plugin when
      recording a playbook
    - Added a new "failed" status for tasks that is used by the
      callback plugin when there is at least one failed result
      for a given task
    - Added a new "uuid" field for tasks which is the uuid
      provided by Ansible for a task. It is used by the callback
      plugin to increase the reliability and accuracy when
      recording results even if they arrive out of order.
  - Several fixes and improvements for the distributed sqlite
    database backend:
    - Added a new index page for listing and linking to available
      databases. This is a work in progress that is intended to
      be improved in the future.
    - Return a HTTP 405 error when trying to write to read-only
      endpoints
    - Fixed the /healthcheck/ endpoint to make sure it is routed
      properly
    - Improved database engine settings and WSGI application

      information
    - Improved troubleshooting documentation and tips to improve
      playbook recording performance

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 12 16:43:03 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Clean up the SPEC file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  4 08:41:00 UTC 2022 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.8:
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - Improved debug logging to include some hooks that were missing (#374)
  - Added a localhost_to_hostname toggle in the callback (#336)
    This adds two configuration parameters to the callback:
    - ARA_LOCALHOST_AS_HOSTNAME
    - ARA_LOCALHOST_AS_HOSTNAME_FORMAT
    These are useful in use cases where playbooks are run against localhost,
    whether directly (with ansible-playbook) or indirectly (via
    ansible-pull).
    When enabled, ara will save results under the hostname (or fqdn) of
    'localhost' instead of associating every result to localhost.
    This is meant to make it easier to distinguish results between different
    hosts even though the playbooks may have all run against 'localhost'.
  Server
  ------
  - Added a setting for CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS (#345)
  - Fixed logging configuration to avoid conflicting with ansible (#367)
    See upgrade notes for changes to the server's settings.yaml.
  UI
  --
  - API browser: disable forms to improve performance (#323)
  - Include the version of ara when generating static reports (#318)
  - Add a column in task results for displaying the task's tags (#281,#375)
  CLI
  ---
  - Added "--latest" to "ara host list" to show only the latest playbook (#327)
  Docs
  ----
  - Refreshed authentication docs and recommend using EXTERNAL_AUTH
    with nginx or apache in front (#319)
  - Add database and authentication tips to troubleshooting (#355)
  Packaging and dependencies
  --------------------------
  - API Server container images have been bumped to fedora35 and centos8-stream
  - Updated setup.cfg to fix a deprecation warning for python 3.10 (#371)
  - Fixed distutils.sysconfig deprecation warning on python 3.10 (#369)
  - Fixed dynaconf deprecation warning when loading settings (#369)
  - psycopg2 has been pinned to <2.9 due to incompatibility with django 2.2 (#321,#326)
  - dynaconf has been pinned to <3.0 when using python3.5 (#372)
    dynaconf>=3.0 supports python>=3.6.
  Misc
  ----
  - General CI maintenance
  - Updated Zuul to test the latest versions of ansible and ansible-core
  - Re-enabled container image updates on DockerHub and Quay.io
  - Added an example script with ansible-runner (#343)
  Upgrade notes
  -------------
  - There have been fixes to logging which requires changes to the
    server's settings.yaml or LOGGING configuration. (#367)
    A warning will be printed if the configuration file must be updated
    and it can be updated manually or by generating a new configuration file.
  - ara 1.5.8 is the last release that will support python3.5.
    Python 3.5 reached the end of its life on September 13th, 2020.
    An upcoming release will update the version of django to the next LTS (2.2 to 3.2)
    which will bump the requirement to python>=3.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 24 08:35:20 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.7:
  UI
  --
  - Added a new "hosts" page to browse and search reports by host name
  - Improved page HTML titles to be dynamic based on the context
  - Added a note highlighting if a task has been delegated to another host
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/282)
  - Improved how long file paths or playbook names are truncated and displayed
  API
  ---
  - Added a new read-only API endpoint: /api/v1/latesthosts
    It provides the latest playbook result for each host name.
    Under the hood, it implements the machinery for updating the latest host
    every time a host is created or deleted and includes a SQL migration to
    initially populate a new database table with the latest hosts.
  - Added a `delegated_to` field to results in order to record a host id to which
    a task has been delegated.
  - Added support for finding results delegated to a specific host:
    /api/v1/results?delegated_to=<host_id>
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - Fixed tasks and results being recorded out of order when using "strategy: free"
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/260)

  Documentation
  -------------
  - Removed an unused sphinx lexer to allow recent versions of sphinx>=4
  - Created a new troubleshooting guide with common issues:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html
  - Added a database relationship graph to the endpoint documentation:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-documentation.html#relationship-between-objects
  Upgrade notes
  -------------
  It is always recommended to take a backup of your database before upgrading.
  This release includes two database migrations that must be run:
  - One for populating the data for the new /api/v1/latesthosts endpoint as well
    as the new 'hosts' page
  - One for adding a `delegated_to` field in the results.
    Note that delegated tasks will only be recorded as such from 1.5.7 on.
  - After upgrading to 1.5.7, database migrations can be run manually with the
    `ara-manage migrate` command if they are not taken care of automatically by the
    callback plugin.
  Known issues
  ------------
  - ara will not record task delegation for tasks that are skipped or for
    items in a loop that are skipped because Ansible doesn't provide the
    necessary information in those cases.
- from version 1.5.6
  UI
  --
  - Refactored the built-in reporting UI with the bootstrap CSS framework using themes from bootswatch
  - Added a dark theme in addition to the default light theme (toggle at the top right)

  - bugfix: Fixed broken documentation link to ara_record (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/219)
  API
  ---
  - Playbook references will now always include CLI arguments, for example:
    /api/v1/tasks/1 ->
    {
      "id": 1,
      "playbook": {
        "id": 1,
        "arguments": {
          #...
        }
      }
    }
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - bugfix: Truncate play UUIDs given back by ansible-runner when running
    in serial (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/211)
- from version 1.5.5
  API
  ---
  - Added support for searching playbooks by ansible_version, for example:
    /api/v1/playbooks?ansible_version=2.10
  UI
  --

  - ara playbook metrics: provides stats aggregated by name, path, ansible version or controller
  - ara host metrics: provides task result stats for hosts across playbooks
  - ara task metrics: provides duration stats aggregated by task name, action/module or path
  - Threading is now disabled by default to avoid running into sqlite locking contention
    For details, see: https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/195
  - The callback didn't provide a timezone for timestamps which could result in a wrong
    interpretation by the API server. Timestamps are now provided as UTC.
  - The hostname of the controller that ran the playbook is now recorded by ara
  - ARA API server container images are now published to quay.io/recordsansible/ara-api
    in addition to hub.docker.com/r/recordsansible/ara-api.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 14:57:08 UTC 2019 - Itxaka serrano <igarcia@suse.com>

- Move some requirements into recommends.
  Ara has changed and its no longer bundling the server with the
  main package, so most of the requirements related to the
  django server can be moved into recommends. Ara will raise a
  message if a user tries to execute the server part but the
  requirements are missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 30 12:12:16 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>
