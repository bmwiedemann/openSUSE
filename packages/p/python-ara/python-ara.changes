Wed Jul 12 16:43:03 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Clean up the SPEC file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  4 08:41:00 UTC 2022 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.8:
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - Improved debug logging to include some hooks that were missing (#374)
  - Added a localhost_to_hostname toggle in the callback (#336)
    This adds two configuration parameters to the callback:
    - ARA_LOCALHOST_AS_HOSTNAME
    - ARA_LOCALHOST_AS_HOSTNAME_FORMAT
    These are useful in use cases where playbooks are run against localhost,
    whether directly (with ansible-playbook) or indirectly (via
    ansible-pull).
    When enabled, ara will save results under the hostname (or fqdn) of
    'localhost' instead of associating every result to localhost.
    This is meant to make it easier to distinguish results between different
    hosts even though the playbooks may have all run against 'localhost'.
  Server
  ------
  - Added a setting for CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS (#345)
  - Fixed logging configuration to avoid conflicting with ansible (#367)
    See upgrade notes for changes to the server's settings.yaml.
  UI
  --
  - API browser: disable forms to improve performance (#323)
  - Include the version of ara when generating static reports (#318)
  - Add a column in task results for displaying the task's tags (#281,#375)
  CLI
  ---
  - Added "--latest" to "ara host list" to show only the latest playbook (#327)
  Docs
  ----
  - Refreshed authentication docs and recommend using EXTERNAL_AUTH
    with nginx or apache in front (#319)
  - Add database and authentication tips to troubleshooting (#355)
  Packaging and dependencies
  --------------------------
  - API Server container images have been bumped to fedora35 and centos8-stream
  - Updated setup.cfg to fix a deprecation warning for python 3.10 (#371)
  - Fixed distutils.sysconfig deprecation warning on python 3.10 (#369)
  - Fixed dynaconf deprecation warning when loading settings (#369)
  - psycopg2 has been pinned to <2.9 due to incompatibility with django 2.2 (#321,#326)
  - dynaconf has been pinned to <3.0 when using python3.5 (#372)
    dynaconf>=3.0 supports python>=3.6.
  Misc
  ----
  - General CI maintenance
  - Updated Zuul to test the latest versions of ansible and ansible-core
  - Re-enabled container image updates on DockerHub and Quay.io
  - Added an example script with ansible-runner (#343)
  Upgrade notes
  -------------
  - There have been fixes to logging which requires changes to the
    server's settings.yaml or LOGGING configuration. (#367)
    A warning will be printed if the configuration file must be updated
    and it can be updated manually or by generating a new configuration file.
  - ara 1.5.8 is the last release that will support python3.5.
    Python 3.5 reached the end of its life on September 13th, 2020.
    An upcoming release will update the version of django to the next LTS (2.2 to 3.2)
    which will bump the requirement to python>=3.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 24 08:35:20 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.7:
  UI
  --    
  - Added a new "hosts" page to browse and search reports by host name
  - Improved page HTML titles to be dynamic based on the context
  - Added a note highlighting if a task has been delegated to another host
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/282)
  - Improved how long file paths or playbook names are truncated and displayed
  API
  ---
  - Added a new read-only API endpoint: /api/v1/latesthosts
    It provides the latest playbook result for each host name.
    Under the hood, it implements the machinery for updating the latest host
    every time a host is created or deleted and includes a SQL migration to
    initially populate a new database table with the latest hosts.
  - Added a `delegated_to` field to results in order to record a host id to which
    a task has been delegated.
  - Added support for finding results delegated to a specific host:
    /api/v1/results?delegated_to=<host_id>
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - Fixed tasks and results being recorded out of order when using "strategy: free"
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/260)
  - Added support for recording 'delegate_to' on tasks
  Documentation
  -------------
  - Removed an unused sphinx lexer to allow recent versions of sphinx>=4
  - Created a new troubleshooting guide with common issues:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html
  - Added a database relationship graph to the endpoint documentation:
    https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-documentation.html#relationship-between-objects
  Upgrade notes
  -------------
  It is always recommended to take a backup of your database before upgrading.
  This release includes two database migrations that must be run:
  - One for populating the data for the new /api/v1/latesthosts endpoint as well
    as the new 'hosts' page
  - One for adding a `delegated_to` field in the results.
    Note that delegated tasks will only be recorded as such from 1.5.7 on.
  - After upgrading to 1.5.7, database migrations can be run manually with the
    `ara-manage migrate` command if they are not taken care of automatically by the
    callback plugin.
  Known issues
  ------------
  - ara will not record task delegation for tasks that are skipped or for
    items in a loop that are skipped because Ansible doesn't provide the
    necessary information in those cases.
- from version 1.5.6
  UI
  --    
  - Refactored the built-in reporting UI with the bootstrap CSS framework using themes from bootswatch
  - Added a dark theme in addition to the default light theme (toggle at the top right)
  - Improved the mobile version of the reporting interface
  - Improved the playbook and task result tables
  - Revamped search forms for playbook and playbook results

  - Moved ansible-playbook CLI arguments to a modal
  - Added an "about" modal with the version of ara and links to resources
  - Moved the link to the documentation to the "about" modal
  - Clicking on a host or task name in a playbook report will now filter results for that host or task
  - bugfix: Links to files including a lineno will now highlight that line (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/154)
  - bugfix: Fixed broken documentation link to ara_record (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/219)
  API
  ---
  - Playbook references will now always include CLI arguments, for example:
    /api/v1/tasks/1 ->
    {
      "id": 1,
      "playbook": {
        "id": 1,
        "arguments": {
          #...
        }
      }
    }
  Callback plugin
  ---------------
  - bugfix: Truncate play UUIDs given back by ansible-runner when running
    in serial (https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/211)
- from version 1.5.5
  API
  ---    
  - Added support for searching playbooks by ansible_version, for example:
    /api/v1/playbooks?ansible_version=2.10
  UI
  --
  - Added syntax highlighting to task results
  - Added support for rendering nested results for tasks with loops
  - Added support for rendering diffs provided by "ansible-playbook --diff"

Mon Mar 15 08:27:33 UTC 2021 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

  - ara playbook metrics: provides stats aggregated by name, path, ansible version or controller
  - ara host metrics: provides task result stats for hosts across playbooks

  - Threading is now disabled by default to avoid running into sqlite locking contention
    For details, see: https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/195
  - The callback didn't provide a timezone for timestamps which could result in a wrong
    interpretation by the API server. Timestamps are now provided as UTC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 14:57:08 UTC 2019 - Itxaka serrano <igarcia@suse.com>

- Move some requirements into recommends.
  Ara has changed and its no longer bundling the server with the
  main package, so most of the requirements related to the
  django server can be moved into recommends. Ara will raise a
  message if a user tries to execute the server part but the
  requirements are missing.
