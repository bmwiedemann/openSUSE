    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.5.1:
  * A new 'ara' CLI API client is now available.
  * New settings have been added:
    + ARA_EXTERNAL_AUTH for enabling Django's external authentication.
    + ARA_DATABASE_OPTIONS for passing options to the Django database
      backend such as SSL.
  * Nested children resources are no longer returned, improving performance
    considerably for larger playbooks.
  * A new status was added for playbooks, plays and tasks: &quot;expired&quot;.
  * URLs have been pluralized to match the endpoints provided by the API.
  * The introduction of the new CLI adds a requirement on the cliff python
    library.
  * ara 1.5.0 introduces significant API changes, some of which aren't
    backwards compatible such as no longer returning nested resources.
  * Two small SQL migrations have been added to remove result statuses and
    add the expired status for playbooks, plays and tasks. Run them with
    &quot;ara-manage migrate&quot;.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.5.4:
  - ara playbook metrics: provides stats aggregated by name, path, ansible version or controller
  - ara host metrics: provides task result stats for hosts across playbooks
  - ara task metrics: provides duration stats aggregated by task name, action/module or path
  - Threading is now disabled by default to avoid running into sqlite locking contention
    For details, see: https://github.com/ansible-community/ara/issues/195
  - The callback didn't provide a timezone for timestamps which could result in a wrong
    interpretation by the API server. Timestamps are now provided as UTC.
  - The hostname of the controller that ran the playbook is now recorded by ara
  - ARA API server container images are now published to quay.io/recordsansible/ara-api
    in addition to hub.docker.com/r/recordsansible/ara-api.

  - Removed a temporary workaround for dynaconf switching from PyYAML to ruamel.yaml
  - Added missing information about the play when browsing details for a task result
- switch to single build, this is a ansible plugin and cli tool</comment>

    <version>1.6.1</version>
    <time>1689786659</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.6.1 (2022-12-12):
  - callback: Changed how ANSIBLE_TMP is found to work around a
    behavior change in ansible-core 2.14 that ended up creating a
    directory named {{ ANSIBLE_HOME ~ &quot;
  - Added a mysql extra to the python packaging for installing
    the mysqlclient library. This is in addition to the existing
    server and postgresql extra. They are used like this: pip
    install ara[server,mysql,postgresql]
- Update 1.6.0 (2022-12-01):
  It features a new &quot;tasks&quot; page to browse and search for
  tasks across playbook runs as well as many updates, fixes and
  improvements.
  - UI
    - Added a new &quot;Tasks&quot; page similar to the existing pages
      for Playbooks and Hosts. It provides a browseable and
      searchable overview of tasks across playbook runs.
    - Refreshed the host index page:
      - Added a column as well as search arguments for playbook
        name (or path)
      - Replaced the playbook status by a concise summary of task
        status for the host
    - Updated the playbook summary card to include the playbook
      id, the version of ara as well as the version of python.
    - Re-ordered and resized columns in tables to optimize width
      and improve consistency
    - Resized and aligned fields in search forms to use the full
      width available
    - Improved how task tags are displayed
    - Updated HTML page titles to be consistent across pages
    - Replaced fields for searching by task ID and host ID by
      task name and host name
    - Truncate name fields to prevent exceedinly large names to
      distort entire tables
    - Corrected card header font sizes in the host report page
  - callback plugin
    - Added support for recording the user who ran the playbook
    - Added support for recording the version of ara as well as
      the version of python used when running the playbook
    - Added options ARA_RECORD_USER and ARA_RECORD_CONTROLLER
      that can be set to false to avoid recording the user and
      controller hostname
    - Added support for specifying a SSL key, certificate and
      certificate authority for authenticating with a remote ara
      API server using ARA_API_KEY, ARA_API_CERT and ARA_API_CA
      respectively.
    - Fixed host fact recording to ensure it works when using
      FQCN-style tasks (ex: setup &amp; ansible.builtin.setup)
    - Increased reliability and accuracy when recording results
      that can arrive out of order when using multi-threading
      or the free strategy by using the task uuid provided by
      Ansible
    - Truncate playbook, play, host and label names in
      circumstances where their length exceeds 255 characters
    - Ignore and don't record files in ~/.ansible/tmp by default
  - API Server
    - Bumped django requirement from 2.2 LTS to 3.2 LTS and
      removed the pin on the version of psycopg2 accordingly
    - Added a new configuration option, ARA_BASE_PATH, to let
      the server listen on an alternate path. It will continue
      to default to &quot;/&quot; but it could, for example, be set to
      &quot;/ara/&quot;.
    - Lifted requirement on tzlocal, improve timezone detection
      and mitigate when the timezone can't be found by defaulting
      to UTC
  - Several new database model and API fields:
    - Added client_version and server_version fields to
      playbooks, meant to represent the version of the ara
      callback and server used in recording the playbook
    - Added python_version field to playbooks to save the version
      of python used by Ansible and the callback plugin when
      recording a playbook
    - Added a new &quot;failed&quot; status for tasks that is used by the
      callback plugin when there is at least one failed result
      for a given task
    - Added a new &quot;uuid&quot; field for tasks which is the uuid
      provided by Ansible for a task. It is used by the callback
      plugin to increase the reliability and accuracy when
      recording results even if they arrive out of order.
  - Several fixes and improvements for the distributed sqlite
    database backend:
    - Added a new index page for listing and linking to available
      databases. This is a work in progress that is intended to
      be improved in the future.
    - Return a HTTP 405 error when trying to write to read-only
      endpoints
    - Fixed the /healthcheck/ endpoint to make sure it is routed
      properly
    - Improved database engine settings and WSGI application
      configuration The WSGI application should now always
      be &quot;ara.server.wsgi&quot; instead of needing to specify
      &quot;ara.server.wsgi.distributed_sqlite&quot;
  - API client
    - Added support for specifying a SSL key, certificate and
      certificate authority for authenticating with a remote ara
      API server
    - Remove InsecureRequestWarning for insecure requests when
      SSL verification is not enabled.
  - CLI
    - Fixed wrong parsing of durations longer than 24 hours
    - Added support for searching playbooks by user
    - Added support for specifying a SSL key, certificate and
      certificate authority for authenticating with a remote ara
      API server using ARA_API_KEY, ARA_API_CERT and ARA_API_CA
      respectively.
  - Docs
    - Refreshed and improved the README, reformatted it from rst
      to markdown
    - Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file and refreshed contribution
      documentation
    - Explicitly call out and recommend setting up authentication
      for production use in order to prevent leaking sensitive
      information
    - Improved troubleshooting documentation and tips to improve
      playbook recording performance

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- update to 1.7.0:
  * Update bootstrap CSS from 4.6.0 to 5.3.0 and fix broken layout
    and components as a result of the update
  * Removed separate light/dark themes via bootstrap-darkly and
    bootstrap-flatly: bootstrap 5.3 features a new built-in dark
    theme
  * Re-worked the dark/light theme selection to match the new
    bootstrap built-in dark theme including pygments highlighting
    for pretty-printed output
  * Removed jquery, it is no longer required with bootstrap
  * Re-worked implementation of file line highlighting since it
    relied on jquery
  * Fixed tooltip implementation (i.e, for task tags) since the
    implementation in bootstrap had changed
  * Large chunks of templating were moved out to partials/tables and
    partials/search in order to improve readability.
  * Round of template cleanups and fixes as reported by djlint
  * Will continue to be a work in progress to simplify and standardize
    templates.
  * Raised the requirement on django from &gt;=3.2,&lt;3.3 to &gt;=3.2,&lt;4.3 to
    allow installation with the latest LTS release of django.
   * Raised the requirement on python from &gt;=3.6 to &gt;=3.8 to accomodate
    django 4.2.
  * Ignored Django warning about the lack of a STATIC_ROOT directory.
    ara uses whitenoise for serving static files which makes the warning
    superfluous. (#492)
