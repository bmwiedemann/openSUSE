  <title>Perl interface to the UNIX syslog(3) calls</title>
  <description>This module provides an interface to the system logger syslogd(8) via
Perl's XSUBs. The implementation attempts to resemble the native libc-
functions of your system, so that anyone being familiar with syslog.h
should be able to use this module right away.</description>
