-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 00:58:17 UTC 2010 - bitshuffler@opensuse.org

- Updated to 1.0.3
  * Make sure available and used capacity are not printed in a partition's
    properties dialog if they are not known
  * Make sure fsck.msdos does not want to modify a file system when it is being
    called to read the file system usage
  * Warn the user when trying to overwrite an existing partition with another or
    an image file
  * Clear the clipboard if undoing an operation deleted the partition that was in it
  * Keep the current UUID when resizing a swap partition
  * Fix the build by explicitly linking the partition manager executable against
    the KDE libs it uses
  * Do not allow pasting a source partition on a bigger target partition when the
    source partition's file system cannot be grown to fill the target partition

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 25 18:24:40 UTC 2010 - bitshuffler@opensuse.org

- Updated to 1.0.2
  * Copy a file system's UUID to the copied file system when creating a file
    system from another one.
  * Implement a workaround for a libparted bug that makes it sometimes fail to
    commit changes to the OS in versions earlier than 2.2.
  * Update the partition's file system and re-check for constraints if the
    partition's role is changed in the "Create New Partition" dialog. This fixes
    a bug where the user was not able to grow an extended partition if he'd
    previously selected a file system that cannot grow beyond a certain size.
  * Always use the correct icons in modified ok/cancel buttons in dialogs and
    message boxes
  * Fix a crash when operations to create, resize and delete an extended
    partitions where incorrectly merged into one (bug 232092)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 10 11:26:49 UTC 2010 - rwooninck@opensuse.org

- Updated to 1.0.1
   - Fix a bug that made it impossible to activate or deactivate a 
     swap file system.
   - Correctly handle linux swap even with newer parted versions.
   - Ask for an administrator's password on startup so that non-KDE 
     users can run the application from their launcher.
   - Use the "blkid" command as an alternative to "vol_id" if the 
     latter is unavailable.
   - Do not crash when using the Oxygen style under KDE SC 4.4.
   - Do not crash when the user clicks in the partition widget with 
     newer g++ versions.
   - Sort devices by name after scanning.
   - Don't disable updates for the partition widget while applying 
     operations. This leads to corrupted graphics unter Qt4.6.
   - Work around a LibParted segmentation fault when the Linux Device 
     Mapper is used and /dev/mapper has non-existing entries.
   - The above also works around a LibParted problem when the BIOS has 
     a floppy drive configured but none is actually present.
   - Set item height in the partition and devices lists to 32 pixel 
     to make them look less condensed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 02:00:49 UTC 2009 - bitshuffler@opensuse.org

- Updated to 1.0.0
   - Many translations heavily improved.
   - Correctly handle ext4 file systems even with patched parted 1.8.8 (and hopefully 1.8.9 too). Patch by Fatih Asici. (bug #195243)
   - Clear the partition flags for a copied partition in the preview. (bug #202346)
   - Write the new start sector to the partition's boot sector if an NTFS file system was moved or copied. (bug #202329)

   - Sort items in file system combo boxes case-insensitively.
   - Fix a bug where the total free space available could get smaller and smaller when moving an existing partition in a dialog.
   - Fix a bug that the progress information wasn't set as window title for the top level application window.
   - Speed up copying file systems (and thus moving, resizing and copying).
   - Add some basic timing output to the detailed report for copying file systems.
   - Find a file system's mount point even if it is identified by label in fstab.
   - Add support for reading file system labels from FAT16 and FAT32.
   - Fix a bug where the volume label for a linuxswap file system was lost when resizing it.
   - Make sure all interesting information shown in labels anywhere in the application is user-selectable with the mouse.
   - Display the UUID for most file systems that support it.
   - Always show the current file system in the partition properties dialog's file system combo box, even if it cannot be created, is too big or too small.
