-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  2 19:15:01 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.2:
  * Python 3, version 3.5 or later, is required.
  * Installing from source code using Autotools requires Python 3.5 or
    later.
  * dbus.gobject_service, dbus.types.UTF8String and the utf8_strings
  keyword argument were only usable with Python 2, and therefore have
  been removed, along with the rest of the special cases for Python 2.
  * Add methods to Message objects to manipulate the interactive
  authorization flag
  * Add licensing information in REUSE format
  * Raise ValueError instead of crashing with assertion failure when a
  Unix fd index number is greater than the number of fds actually attached
  to the message (firewalld#985; Simon McVittie)
  * Raise ValueError instead of crashing with assertion failure when
  a negative number is passed to the UnixFd constructor
  * Fix undefined escape sequences in docstrings
  * Make `distcheck` compatible with Automake 1.16.4, by forcing an
  appropriate prefix to be used
  * Update AX_PYTHON_DEVEL from autoconf-archive for better
  forwards-compatibility
  * Avoid various deprecation warnings in the build system
  - distutils.sysconfig → sysconfig
  - distutils.util → sysconfig

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 06:30:09 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.2.18:
  * dbus-python will be built for python3
  * Python 2 reached end-of-life on 2020-01-01. A future version of
    dbus-python is likely to remove Python 2 support.
  * Move from collections.Sequence to collections.abc.Sequence on
    Python ≥ 3.3, for Python 3.10 compatibility
  * Avoid another deprecation warning for inspect.getargspec().
    This is similar to the one fixed in 1.2.4, but for dbus.decorators.signal
    rather than dbus.decorators.method. (dbus-python!8; Martin Stumpf)
  * Fix an unlikely fd leak if memory allocation fails for UnixFd
  * Fix memory and fd leak if UnixFd is given an invalid negative
    variant_level
  * Avoid more deprecation warnings
  * Disable -Wdeclaration-after-statement. Python 3.9 relies on intermixed
    declarations and statements in its headers, so we can no longer
    enforce this. (Simon McVittie)
  * Convert examples to Python 3 (Simon McVittie)
  * Use the same Python executable for build and dist/distcheck by default
  * CI fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  9 00:48:35 UTC 2021 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- Enable testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  9 16:16:55 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.2.16:
  * All tests are run even if the tap.py module is not available, although
    diagnostics for failing tests will be better if it is present.
  * Forbid unexpanded AX-prefixed macros more selectively

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 11 17:44:15 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Support builds with more than one python3 flavor
  gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#66
- Remove shebang from examples (rpmlint warning, is in common doc)
- Clean duplicate python flavor variables for configure
- Update the provides/obsoletes tags for old-style dbus-1-$python 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  8 01:19:38 UTC 2020 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Version update to version 1.2.14: 
  * Ensure that the numeric types from dbus.types get the same
    str() under Python 3.8 that they did under previous versions.
  * Disable -Winline.
  * Add Python 3.8 to CI.
  - Changes in version 1.2.12:
  * Don't save and restore the exception indicator when called
    from C code.
  - Changes in version 1.2.10:
  * Rewrite CONTRIBUTING.md document, based on Wayland's equivalent
  * Add clearer license information using SPDX-License-Identifier.
  * Improve test coverage.
  * Don't set deprecated tp_print to NULL under Python 3.
  * Include inherited methods and properties when documenting
    objects, which regressed when migrating from epydoc to sphinx.
  * Add missing variant_level member to UnixFd type, for parity
    with the other dbus.types types (dbus-python!3.
    - Note that this is a potentially incompatible change: unknown
      keyword arguments were previously ignored (!) and are now an
      error.
  * Don't reply to method calls if they have the NO_REPLY_EXPECTED
    flag (fd.o#32529, dbus-python#26.
  * Silence -Wcast-function-type with gcc 8.
  * Fix distcheck with python3.7 by deleting __pycache__ during
    uninstall.
  * Consistently save and restore the exception indicator when
    called from C code.
  * Avoid a long-standing race condition in the automated tests.
  * Fix Qt website URL.
- Up dbus dependency; 1.8 is now required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 15:05:11 UTC 2018 - Nicolas Bock <nicolas.bock@suse.com>

- Add missing dependency for pkg-config files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  4 13:48:04 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to version 1.2.8:
  * Python 2.7 required or 3.4 respectively
  * Tests use tap.py functionality
  * Upstream dropped epydoc completely
  * See NEWS for more

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  4 13:44:57 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Use requires_ge instead of the rpm calls

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 18 13:03:22 UTC 2017 - jmatejek@suse.com

- drop unneeded epydoc requirement properly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  7 11:17:04 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Escape the usage of %{VERSION} when calling out to rpm.
  RPM 4.14 has %{VERSION} defined as 'the main packages version'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 16:26:45 UTC 2017 - jmatejek@suse.com

- drop unneeded epydoc requirement (API docs were not built anyway)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  8 17:21:51 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Rename package from dbus-1-python to python-dbus-python to
  conform to openSUSE package naming guidelines.
- Switch to single-spec version
- Update to version 1.2.4
  + Enhancements:
    * Continous integration metadata for travis-ci.org is now available.
      Similar to dbus, this is split into .travis.yml (Travis-specifics)
      and tools/ci-build.sh (intended to be useful for any CI framework,
      although it does include various workarounds for travis-ci oddities).
      (Simon McVittie)
  + Fixes:
    * Make dbus.version a tuple again, not a list, for consistent sorting.
      This was a regression in 1.2.2. (Debian #816729, Simon McVittie)
    * Use inspect.signature() instead of inspect.getargspec() on Python
      versions that have it. inspect.getargspec() is deprecated in recent
      Python 3 and seems to have disappeared from 3.6 nightly builds.
      (Simon McVittie)
    * Make the tests pass in "narrow" Python builds where unicode objects
      are UTF-16, rather than the UCS-4 used in Linux distributions.
      (fd.o #57140, Simon McVittie)
    * Always include headers in a consistent order (Debian #749133, Simon McVittie)
    * Include config.h in all C code that we compile. This is necessary
      on platforms where it might contain something like "#define _GNU_SOURCE"
      or "#define inline __inline".
     (Simon McVittie)
- Update to version 1.2.2
  + Versioning changes:
    * dbus-python releases now have an even micro version (1.2.0, 1.2.2),
      and snapshots from git have an odd micro version (1.2.1).
  + Dependencies:
    * Building from git (but not from tarballs) now requires
      macros from the GNU Autoconf Archive, for example the autoconf-archive
      package in Debian or Fedora derivatives.
    * Building from git (but not from tarballs) now requires Automake 1.13
      or later.
    * The automated tests and some examples now require PyGI (the gi module),
      not PyGObject 2 (the deprecated glib and gobject modules).
  + Enhancements:
    * There is now a setuptools setup.py, allowing dbus-python to be installed
      into a virtualenv using pip from a standard Automake source release. This
      requires pre-existing system-wide installations of the normal build
      dependencies (pkg-config, libdbus, dbus-glib, a C compiler) and has
      some limitations. For system-wide installations and development,
      please use the Autoconf/Automake build system directly.
      (fd.o #55439; Simon McVittie)
    * dbus-python now uses the common compiler warnings from AX_COMPILER_FLAGS
      (Simon McVittie)
    * The automated tests can now be installed as GNOME-style "installed tests",
      and should be somewhat more reliable (Simon McVittie)
  + Fixes:
    * ``from dbus.service import *`` now imports FallbackObject
     (fd.o #85720; Ben Longbons)
    * The GConf-related examples work again (fd.o #85720; Ben Longbons)
    * Consistently make examples executable, and install them all
      (fd.o #85720; Ben Longbons)
    * Search PATH for an appropriately-versioned pythonX.Y-config, or as a last
      resort python-config, if there isn't a ${PYTHON}-config in the
      same directory as ${PYTHON} (fd.o #92085; Yamashita, Yuu)
    * Add support for the Automake 1.13 parallel test driver (Simon McVittie)
    * Skip building API documentation if "import epydoc" fails (Simon McVittie)
- Add python version-dependent and python version-indepent devel
  packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 16 07:02:42 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add missing dependency on python-gobject (bnc#850792)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  3 18:03:27 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Removed the %{RELEASE} from the dbus-1 Requires: entries (fixes also Factory
  auto check).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  2 20:55:23 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  Dependencies:
  - libdbus 1.6 or later is now required.
  Enhancements:
  - Unicode Corrigendum 9: when used with a suitable version of libdbus
    (1.6.10 or later, or 1.7.2 or later), noncharacters in strings are
    now accepted
  Fixes:
  - Support DBusException('something with non—ASCII') under Python 2
    (Michael Vogt, smcv; fd.o #55899)
  - Correct some misleading wording in COPYING which was written under the
    assumption that libdbus could actually be relicensed to MIT/X11
    (Thiago Macieira)
  - Avoid variable-length arrays, because MSVC++ is still stuck in 1998
    (based on patches from Christoph Höger, fd.o #51725)
  - Remove unnecessary uses of stdint.h (fd.o #51725)
  - Add support for Unix compilers not supporting 'inline', for completeness
  - Use GObject.__class__ instead of GObjectMeta, which can no longer be
    imported from gi.repository.GObject in pygobject 3.8
  - Fix autoreconfiscation on Automake 1.13 (Marko Lindqvist, fd.o #59006)
- Removed libxml2-python runtime requirement (not needed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 19 18:33:18 UTC 2012 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  Dependencies:
  - libdbus 1.6 or later is now recommended. It is not strictly required yet.
  Fixes:
  - Validate UTF-8 according to the rules libdbus uses, falling back to our
    own (inefficient) implementation if not compiled against dbus >= 1.6
    (fdo#40817)
  - Under Python 3, in the absence of introspection or signature='...',
    pass dbus.ObjectPath or dbus.Signature arguments with the obvious
    signature 'o' or 'g', not 's'. This previously only worked in Python 2.
    (fdo#50740)
  From version 1.1.0:
  Deprecations:
  - dbus.gobject_service is deprecated. Use dbus.gi_service and PyGI in new
    code.
  API changes:
  - dbus.gobject_service works in legacy PyGObject 2 applications again,
    like it did before 1.0. The down side is that it doesn't work in all PyGI
    applications any more, unlike 1.0. In PyGI applications, depend on
    dbus-python >= 1.1 and use dbus.gi_service instead - its API is the same.
    (fdo#48904, deb#670516)
  - dbus.gobject_service has been removed from Python 3 builds altogether.
  Enhancements:
  - Use DBusBasicValue from libdbus 1.5, if available, rather than reinventing
    it
  Fixes:
  - Put sockets for the regression tests in /tmp, not the builddir, fixing
    test failures in a really long builddir (fdo#46747)
  - Fix a reference leak in dbus_py_variant_level_set (fdo#47108)
  - Modify AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS so the "another way" works with Python 3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 27 11:04:49 UTC 2012 - highwaystar.ru@gmail.com

- dbus-1-python3 package added 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 20:33:58 UTC 2012 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- New upstream version 1.0.0:
  Dependencies:
  - libdbus 1.4 or later is now required.
  - Python 2.6 or later is now required. If Python 3 is used, it must be
    version 3.2 or later.
  - GNU make (or, at your own risk, another make with the GNU $(patsubst)
    extension) is now required.
  API changes:
  - dbus_bindings, which was never meant to be public API and has been
    deprecated for nearly 5 years, has finally been removed.
  - The repr() of every dbus-python object is now unicode.
  - The Python 3 API is not the same as the Python 2 API; see PY3PORT.rst for
    details.
  Enhancements:
  - Python 3 compatibility (fd.o #26420)
  - MethodCallMessage and SignalMessage now have a more useful repr()
  Fixes:
  - OOM while appending a unicode object to a message no longer leaks a string
  - If libdbus somehow gives us invalid UTF-8, don't crash
  - Fix rst2html failure in non-UTF-8 locales
 From version 0.84.0:
  Enhancements:
  - fd.o #30812: add the UnixFd type, and support Unix fd passing if compiled
    against a new enough libdbus
  - fd.o #34342: add Connection.set_allow_anonymous(bool)
  - fd.o #21017: add configure arguments PYTHON_INCLUDES and PYTHON_LIBS which
    can be used to override $PYTHON-config
  Fixes:
  - fd.o #35626: clear ProxyObject's pending introspection queue after
    execution
  - fd.o #22560: remove duplicate code from example-async-client
  - fd.o #36206: allow signature='x' among ProxyObject method arguments
- Spec file updates:
  - Removed pyrex from BuildRequires: (not needed anymore).
  - Removed "autoreconf -fi" from %build section and also libtool requirement
    (not needed).
  - Added epydoc and python-docutils in BuildRequires: to enable generation of
    HTML docs and API documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 10:23:39 UTC 2012 - cfarrell@suse.com

- license update: MIT
  SPDX format for MIT license

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 20:07:54 UTC 2011 - coolo@suse.com

- add libtool as buildrequire to make the spec file more reliable

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 18 17:17:12 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant tags/sections from specfile
  (cf. packaging guidelines)
- Use %_smp_mflags for parallel build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 17:58:24 UTC 2011 - fcrozat@novell.com

- new upstream version 0.83.2 :
 - libdbus 1.2 is still supported, but libdbus >= 1.4 is 
   recommended.
 - Make BusConnection.list_activatable_names actually call 
   ListActivatableNames, not ListNames
 - Don't override CFLAGS when adding compiler warnings
 - Fix compilation on platforms where Py_ssize_t is larger than 
   int, like x86-64
 - fd.o #21831: deserialize empty byte arrays with byte_arrays=True 
   as ByteArray(''), not ByteArray('None')
 - fd.o #23278, #25105: fix crashes when trying to append more 
   struct entries than the signature allows with libdbus 1.4 
 - fd.o #23831: fix crashes when an embedded Python interpreter 
   imports dbus, is finalized, is re-initialized, and re-imports 
   dbus
 - fd.o #21172: avoid some deprecation warnings in Python 2.6
 - fd.o #15013: add dbus.lowlevel.MESSAGE_TYPE_SIGNAL etc., for 
   those who care about message types at a low level
 - When removing signal matches, clean up internal state, avoiding 
   a memory leak in long-lived Python processes that connect to 
   signals from arbitrarily many object paths (fd.o #17551)
 - When setting the sender of a message, allow it to be 
   org.freedesktop.DBus so you can implement a D-Bus daemon in 
   pure Python

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 31 12:37:02 UTC 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Use %_smp_mflags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  9 08:45:50 CEST 2009 - coolo@novell.com

- use new python macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 00:36:16 CEST 2008 - ro@suse.de

- use py_sitedir macro in filelist 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 29 16:36:27 CEST 2008 - thoenig@suse.de

- new upstream version 0.83.0
 - Add bindings for DBusServer (thanks to Mathias Hasselmann,
   Huang Peng; fd.o #14322, #15514).
 - Omit the service's traceback from certain D-Bus errors:
   specifically, those that were probably deliberately raised as
   part of an API. Subclasses of DBusException that indicate
   programmer error can turn the traceback back on if it seems
   likely to be useful.
 - Don't emit spurious Error messages if libdbus gives object-path
   handlers a message that isn't a method call (most likely because
   of binding to a locally emitted signal, as in fd.o #14199).
 - Make multiple filters added by Connection.add_message_filter
   work (fd.o #15547, thanks to Huang Peng).
 - Make the API docs build correctly when out-of-tree
 - Require dbus 1.0 so we can get rid of DBUS_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 11 10:25:40 CET 2007 - thoenig@suse.de

- supplying reply_handler but not error_handler raises
  MissingReplyHandlerException instead of
  MissingErrorHandlerException, and vice versa (fd.o #12304, patch
  from René Neumann)
- Using non-recursive make for dbus/ directory should fix builds in
  some environments (fd.o #12741) 
- Everything is now under the same MIT/X11 license used for
  Collabora code in the previous release
- Added copyright headers to some files that were still missing
  them

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  5 11:49:42 CET 2007 - thoenig@suse.de

- new upstream version 0.82.3 (skipped 0.82.1 and 0.82.2)
 -  Don't try to distribute COPYING.LGPL-2.1 - no longer exists
 -  Fix NEWS indentation
 -  Mention relicensing in NEWS
 -  Update NEWS, and add regression tests for fd.o #12096 and
    #12403
 -  fd.o #12432: fix documentation for remove_from_connection
 -  dbus.exceptions.DBusException: allow setting _dbus_error_name
    in subclasses
 -  Don't raise KeyError when closing private dbus.Bus.
    (fd.o #12096)
 -  Also deprecate private dbus.Bus in favour of
    dbus.bus.BusConnection - the only things you gain from using
    dbus.Bus are the shared-instance behaviour and some strange
    more-than-one-way-to-do-it APIs.
  - Relicense Collabora code under the MIT/X11 license proposed for
    dbus core, removing all references to the LGPL as a result
  - dbus.service: Don't assume that exceptions passed to
    asynchronous callbacks are the same as the pending exception
    (fd.o #12403, https://dev.laptop.org/ticket/3370)
  - Makefile.am, test/Makefile.am: Use @abs_top_builddir@,
    @abs_top_srcdir@
  - This fixes incorrect Python path for docs and tests if doing
    an out-of-tree
  - build using an absolute path for $(srcdir), and is also
    less ugly.
  - Unset dbus_python_released
  - Release 0.82.2
  - Mention in NEWS that API docs are generated by default
  - Reorganise README to reflect that API docs are generated
    by default
  - Mention incompatibility with 0.82.1 more prominently
  - Check for epydoc version >= 3, and default to building API docs
    if available
  - Update NEWS to mention #11623 fix
  - Add rel_path_keyword to @method (fd.o #11623)
  - Avoid deprecated API in cross-test
  - Fix introspection on objects with more than one connection or
    more than one object path (bugs.fd.o #11794)
  - NEWS: mention the solved build problems related to
    python-config
  - Re-fix checking for Python include paths. Use $PYTHON-config
    like in 0.82.1 if we can, use the hard-coded logic from
    versions prior to 0.82.0 if we can't.
  - Complete the .m4 renaming
  - Move dbus-py-add-rst2htmlflag.m4 to jh-add-cflag.m4 - the
    contents of two of the .m4 files were the opposite of what
    they should be
  - Move jh-add-cflag.m4 to dbuspy-add-rst2htmlflag.m4 - the
    contents of two of the .m4 files were the opposite of what
    they should be
  - Revert "Use python-config to get Python cppflags (patch from
    Ubuntu, fd.o #11282)."
  - Python < 2.5 didn't have python-config (although some
    distributions, e.g. Debian and Ubuntu, shipped it as an
    add-on). Even for 2.5, some distributions install it under
    gratuitously different names (hi, Gentoo). As a result, this
    patch needs replacing with one that doesn't rely on having
    python-config.
  - _dbus_bindings/mainloop.c: Remove Watch and Timeout.
    They were never used, and didn't make a great deal of sense.
    I now believe the right direction for pure-Python mainloop
    support is to define a Pythonic main loop abstraction and
    coerce libdbus to fit into it, rather than pretending the
    objects in libdbus' abstraction are Python objects.
  - NEWS: update with timeout fix
  - Measure async call timeout in seconds as intended, not in
    ms (blocking calls already used seconds). Add regression tests
  - test-client: Avoid deprecated usage - explicitly pass
    SessionBus() to BusName ctor
  - Try to avoid importing things from _dbus_bindings when they
    could be imported from public API
  - Bump version to 0.82.1.YYYYMMDD
  - Avoid cpp directives inside macro calls, to be nice to old
    gcc versions
  - NEWS, configure.ac: 0.82.1, the "double precision" release
  - Use PyArg_ParseTuple correctly, fixing the timeout in
    send_message_with_reply and send_message_with_reply_and_block.
    (bugs.fd.o #11489; thanks to Marco Pesenti Gritti for report
    and initial patch)
  - Unset dbus_python_released
  - .gitignore: ignore patch(1) cruft, and detached signatures
    for the release tarballs
  - dbus.proxies: If making a call with ignore_reply=True, don't
    block for introspection
  - dbus.service: use DBUS_INTROSPECT_1_0_XML_DOCTYPE_DECL_NODE
  - Expose HANDLER_RESULT_HANDLED, HANDLER_RESULT_NOT_YET_HANDLED
    as public API in dbus.lowlevel
  - Get stacklevel right on deprecation of not specifying bus in
    BusName.__init__
  - _dbus_bindings: add DBUS_INTROSPECT_1_0_XML_DOCTYPE_DECL_NODE
    etc.
  - Avoid using deprecated dbus_watch_get_fd()
  - dbus.service: Deprecate the omission of the `bus` argument in
    the BusName constructor.
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Stop using interactive-Python syntax in tutorial to reduce
    user confusion. Closes bugs.fd.o #11209.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 19 19:08:38 CEST 2007 - thoenig@suse.de

- new upstream version 0.82.0 (skipped 0.80.2 and 0.81.0)
  - dbus.service.Object can start off with no Connection or object path, and
    become exported later. If suitable class attributes are set, objects can
    even be exported on multiple connections, or with multiple object-paths,
    or both.
  - dbus.service.FallbackObject implements a whole subtree of object-path space
    (fd.o #9295).
  - ``@method`` accepts a parameter ``connection_keyword`` so methods can find
    out which connection to use for any follow-up actions.
  - ``@signal`` has a new parameter ``rel_path_keyword`` which gets the path at
    which to emit the signal, relative to the path of the FallbackObject.
    ``path_keyword`` is now deprecated, and will raise an exception if used
    on an object with ``SUPPORTS_MULTIPLE_OBJECT_PATHS``, including any
    ``FallbackObject``.
- update to 0.81.0
  - When an Error message on the bus is represented as a DBusException, the
    error name is copied into the exception and can be retrieved by
    get_dbus_name(). Exception handlers should use this instead of looking at
    the stringified form of the exception, unless backwards compatibility
    is needed.
  - DBusException objects now get all arguments from the Error message, not
    just the first (although there will usually only be one). Use the 'args'
    attribute if you need to retrieve them.
  - The Connection, BusConnection and Bus classes have a method
    list_exported_child_objects(path: str) -> list of str, which wraps
    dbus_connection_list_registered()
  - You can remove objects from D-Bus before they become unreferenced, by
    using dbus.service.Object.remove_from_connection()
    (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10457)
- update to 0.80.2
  - Fix numerous memory and reference leaks
  - Only use -Werror if the user specifically asks for it
  - Audit tp_dealloc callbacks to make sure they correctly preserve the
    exception state
  - Relicense files solely owned by Collabora Ltd. more permissively (LGPL/AFL
    rather than GPL/AFL) - this includes the tutorial and all the C code
