  <title>HTTP cookie jars</title>
  <description>This class is for objects that represent a &quot;cookie jar&quot; -- that is, a
database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows
about.

Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to
both store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection.
For more information about cookies refer to
&lt;URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html&gt; and
&lt;URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/&gt;. This module also implements the new
style cookies described in _RFC 2965_. The two variants of cookies are
supposed to be able to coexist happily.</description>
