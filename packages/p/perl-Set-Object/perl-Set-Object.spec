%description
This modules implements a set of objects, that is, an unordered collection
of objects without duplication.

The term _objects_ is applied loosely - for the sake of Set::Object,
anything that is a reference is considered an object.

Set::Object 1.09 and later includes support for inserting scalars
(including the empty string, but excluding 'undef') as well as objects.
This can be thought of as (and is currently implemented as) a degenerate
hash that only has keys and no values. Unlike objects placed into a
Set::Object, scalars that are inserted will be flattened into strings, so
will lose any magic (eg, tie) or other special bits that they went in with;
only strings come out.
