  * In future, HoloViews will not allow non-string values for
    pandas DataFrame column names. This deprecation cycle starts by
    issuing a DeprecationWarning that should not be visible to
    users.
  + Issue DeprecationWarning for invalid DataFrame column types
    (#5457)
- Release 1.15.0
  * This is a major release with a large number of new features and
    bug fixes, as well as updates to Python and Panel
    compatibility.
  ## Compatibility:
  * Python 2 support has finally been dropped with 1.14.9 as the
    last release supporting Python 2
  * HoloViews now requires panel >0.13.1 (#4329)
  * Colormaps for the output of the datashade operation have
    changed to address holoviz/datashader#357; see
    rescale_discrete_levels below. To revert to the old colorbar
    behavior, set ColorbarPlot.rescale_discrete_levels = False in
    the bokeh or mpl plotting modules as appropriate.
  * Updated Sankey algorithm means that some users may need to
    update the node_padding parameter for plots generated with
    earlier releases.
  ## Major features:
  * After a long period of hotfix releases for the 1.14.9 series,
    many new features on the master branch have been released.
    Features relating to datashader support, linked selection and
    improvements to the Bokeh plotting backend are called out in
    their own sections.

  # Datashader features:
  * The following new features have been added to the datashader
    support in HoloViews, mainly focused on Datashader's new
    support for antialiasing lines as well as the new
    rescale_discrete_levels colormapping option.
  * Add automatic categorical legend for datashaded plots (#4806)
  * Implement line_width support when rasterizing spatialpandas
    paths (#5280)
  * Expose rescale_discrete_levels in the Bokeh backend (#5312)

- Update to v1.14.0
  This release brings a number of major features including a
  new IbisInterface, new Plotly Dash support and greatly
  improved Plotly support, and greatly improved interaction
  and integration with Datashader. Many thanks to the many
  contributors to this release, whether directly by submitting
  PRs or by reporting issues and making suggestions.
  Specifically, we would like to thank @philippjfr,
  @jonmmease, and @tonyfast for their work on the
  IbisInterface and @jonmmease for improving Plotly support,
  as well as @kcpevey, @Hoxbro, @marckassay, @mcepl, and
  @ceball for various other enhancements, improvements to
  documentation and testing infrastructure. In addition,
  thanks to the maintainers @jbednar, @jlstevens and
  @philippjfr for contributing to this release. This version
  includes a large number of new features, enhancements, and
  bug fixes.

  It is important to note that version 1.14 will be the last
  HoloViews release supporting Python 2.

  Major features:
  * New Plotly Dash support (#4605)
  * New Plotly support for Tiles element (#4686)
  * New IbisInterface (#4517)
  * Greatly improved Datashader rasterize() (#4567). Previously,
    many of the features of Datashader were available only
    through datashade, which rendered data all the way to RGB
    pixels and thus prevented many client-side Bokeh features
    like hover, colorbars, dynamic colormaps, etc. rasterize now
    supports all these Bokeh features along with nearly all the
    Datashader features previously only available through
    datashade, including (now client-side) histogram
    equalization with cnorm='eq_hist' and easy control of
    transparency via a new Dimension.nodata parameter. See the
    Large Data User Guide for more information.
  Enhancements:
  * Implemented datashader aggregation of Rectangles (#4701)
  * New support for robust color limits (clim_percentile) (#4712)
  * Support for dynamic overlays in link_selections (#4683)
  * Allow clashing Param stream contents (#4677)
  * Ensured pandas does not convert times to UTC (#4711)
  + Removed all use of cyordereddict (#4620)
  * Testing infrastructure moved to GH Actions (#4592)
  Bug fixes:
  * Ensure RangeXY returns x/y ranges in correct order (#4665)
    (#4665)
  * Fix datashader instability with Plotly by disabling padding
    for RGB elements (#4705)
  * Various Dask and cuDF histogram fixes (#4691)
  * Fix handling of custom matplotlib and bokeh colormaps (#4693)
  * Fix cuDF values implementation (#4687)
  * Fixed range calculation on HexTiles (#4689)
  * Use PIL for RGB.load_image (#4639)
  Documentation:
   * Clarified data types accepted by Points (#4430)
   * Updated Introduction notebook (#4682)
   * Fixed releases urls (#4672)
  Compatibility:
  * Warning when there are multiple kdims on Chart elements
    (#4710)
  * Set histogram normed option to False by default (#4258)
  * The default colormap in holoviews is now 'kbc_r' instead of
    'fire'; see issue #3500 for details. This change was made
    mainly because the highest value of the fire colormap is
    white, which meant data was often not visible against a
    white background. To restore the old behavior you can set
    hv.config.default_cmap='fire', which you can do via the
    extension e.g. hv.extension('bokeh',
    config=dict(default_cmap='fire')). There is also
    hv.config.default_gridded_cmap which you can set to 'fire'
    if you wish to use the old colormap for the Raster, Image
    and QuadMesh element types. The default HeatMap colormap has
    also been set to 'kbc_r' for consistency and can be set back
    to the old value of 'RdYlBu_r' via
    hv.config.default_heatmap_cmap.

      easier to use nbconvert. For instance, PNG data will be embedded
      in the notebook if the argument display_formats=['html','png'] is
      supplied to the notebook_extension. (PR #355)
    + Improvements to the display of DynamicMaps as well as many new
      improvements to the Bokeh backend including better VLines/HLines
      and support for the Bars element. (PR #367 , PR #362, PR #339).
    + New Spikes and BoxWhisker elements suitable for representing
      distributions as a sequence of lines or as a box-and-whisker
      plot. (PR #346, PR #339)
    + Improvements to the notebook_extension. For instance, executing
      hv.notebook_extension('bokeh') will now load BokehJS and
      automatically activate the Bokeh backend (if available).
    + Significant performance improvements when using the groupby
      operation on HoloMaps and when working with highly nested
      datastructures. (PR #349, PR #359)
  * Notable bug fixes:
    + DynamicMaps are now properly integrated into the style system
      and can be customized in the same way as HoloMaps. (PR #368)
    + Widgets now work correctly when unicode is used in the dimension
      labels and values (PR #376).
- update to version 1.4.0:
  * Major new features:
    + Data API: The new data API brings an extensible system of to add
      new data interfaces to column based Element types. These
      interfaces allow applying powerful operations on the data
      independently of the data format. The currently supported
      datatypes include NumPy, pandas dataframes and a simple
      dictionary format. (PR #284)
    + Backend API: In this release we completely refactored the
      rendering, plotting and IPython display system to make it easy to
      add new plotting backends. Data may be styled and pickled for each
      backend independently and renderers now support exporting all
      plotting data including widgets as standalone HTML files or with
      separate JSON data.
    + Bokeh backend: The first new plotting backend added via the new
      backend API. Bokeh plots allow for much faster plotting and
      greater interactivity. Supports most Element types and layouts and
      provides facilities for sharing axes across plots and linked
      brushing across plots. (PR #250)
    + DynamicMap: The new DynamicMap class allows HoloMap data to be
      generated on-the-fly while running a Jupyter IPython notebook
      kernel. Allows visualization of unbounded data streams and smooth
      exploration of large continuous parameter spaces. (PR #278)
  * Other features:
    + Easy definition of custom aliases for group, label and Dimension
      names, allowing easier use of LaTeX.
    + New Trisurface and QuadMesh elements.
    + Widgets now allow expressing hierarchical relationships between
      dimensions.
    + Added GridMatrix container for heterogeneous Elements and
      gridmatrix operation to generate scatter matrix showing
      relationship between dimensions.
    + Filled contour regions can now be generated using the contours
      operation.
    + Consistent indexing semantics for all Elements and support for
      boolean indexing for Columns and NdMapping types.
    + New hv.notebook_extension function offers a more flexible
      alternative to %load_ext, e.g. for loading other extensions
      hv.notebook_extension(bokeh=True).
  * Experimental features:
    + Bokeh callbacks allow adding interactivity by communicating
      between bokehJS tools and the IPython kernel, e.g. allowing
      downsampling based on the zoom level.
  * Notable bug fixes:
    + Major speedup rendering large HoloMaps (~ 2-3 times faster).
    + Colorbars now consistent for all plot configurations.
    + Style pickling now works correctly.
  * API Changes:
    + Dimension formatter parameter now deprecated in favor of
      value_format.
    + Types of Chart and Table Element data now dependent on selected
      interface.
    + DFrame conversion interface deprecated in favor of Columns
      pandas interface.

    working extensively on the plotting and rendering system to
    ensure HoloViews is fully backend independent.
  + Highlights/Features:
    * Allowed display of data structures which do not match the
      recommended nesting hierarchy (67b28f3, fbd89c3).

    * Large plotting optimization by computing tight ``bbox_inches`` once
      (e34e339).
    * Widgets now cache frames in the DOM, avoiding flickering in some
      browsers and make use of jinja2 template inheritance. (fc7dd2b)
    * Calling a HoloViews object without arguments now clears any
      associated custom styles. (9e8c343)
  + API Changes

      respectively, while providing backward compatibility for passing
      and accessing the long names (8feb7d2).
    * Combined x/y/zticker plot options into x/y/zticks parameters which
      now accept an explicit number of ticks, an explicit list of tick
      positions (and labels), and a matplotlib tick locator.
    * Changed backend options in %output magic, ``nbagg`` and ``d3`` are
      now modes of the matplotlib backend and can be selected with
      ``backend='matplotlib:nbagg'`` and ``backend='matplotlib:mpld3'``
      respectively. The 'd3' and 'nbagg' options remain supported but will
      be deprecated in future.
    * Customizations should no longer be applied directly to ``Store.options``;
      the ``Store.options(backend='matplotlib')`` object should be
      customized instead.  There is no longer a need to call the
      deprecated ``Store.register_plots`` method.
