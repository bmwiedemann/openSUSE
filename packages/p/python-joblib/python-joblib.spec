%description
Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in
Python. In particular, joblib offers:

  1. transparent disk-caching of the output values and lazy re-evaluation
     (memoize pattern)

  2. parallel computing

  3. logging and tracing of the execution

Joblib can handle large data and has specific optimizations for `numpy` arrays.
