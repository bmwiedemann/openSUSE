  <title>Perl extension for SHA-3</title>
  <description>Digest::SHA3 is written in C for speed. If your platform lacks a C compiler, perhaps you can find the module in a binary form compatible with your particular processor and operating system.

The programming interface is easy to use: it's the same one found in CPAN's Digest module. So, if your applications currently use Digest::SHA and you'd prefer the newer flavor of the NIST standard, it's a simple matter to convert them.</description>
