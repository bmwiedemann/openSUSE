# cymem: A Cython Memory Helper

cymem provides two small memory-management helpers for Cython. They make it
easy to tie memory to a Python object's life-cycle, so that the memory is freed
when the object is garbage collected.

## Overview

The most useful is `cymem.Pool`, which acts as a thin wrapper around the calloc
function:

```python
from cymem.cymem cimport Pool
cdef Pool mem = Pool()
data1 = <int*>mem.alloc(10, sizeof(int))
data2 = <float*>mem.alloc(12, sizeof(float))
```

The `Pool` object saves the memory addresses internally, and frees them when the
object is garbage collected. Typically you'll attach the `Pool` to some cdef'd
class. This is particularly handy for deeply nested structs, which have
complicated initialization functions. Just pass the `Pool` object into the
initializer, and you don't have to worry about freeing your struct at all â€”
all of the calls to `Pool.alloc` will be automatically freed when the `Pool`
expires.
