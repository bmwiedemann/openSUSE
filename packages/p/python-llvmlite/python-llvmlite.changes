    changelog (`Andre Masella <https://github.com/apmasell>`_)

- changes from version 0.39.0:
  * This release predominantly adds new features and improves
    functionality.
    + It's now possible to directly set LLVM "metadata" on global
      variables.
    + Functions and global variables now support the specification of
      a "section" in which they should be placed.
    + The attribute "source_file" had been added to the "ModuleRef"
      class, it returns the module's original file name.
    + The FFI library binding to LLVM is now loaded with "importlib"
      to increase compatibility with other projects and improve
      start-up times.
    + Linux builds now use the parallel option to "make" to speed up
      building the FFI library.
    + Preliminary work to expose LLVM's optimization-remarks interface
      has been undertaken. The bindings are exposed and tested, but
      not yet documented for general use (additional work is needed).
  * Deprecations:
    + The "llvmlite.llvmpy" module has been deprecated as the
      functionality it provides is available through the "llvmlite.ir"
      module. See the deprecation guide in the user documentation for
      details and recommendations regarding replacement.

    pull request #813 from seibert/m1_support (`esc
  * PR `#845 <https://github.com/numba/llvmlite/pull/845>`_: Backport
    #786 for 0.38.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 17:12:17 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.38.0
  * This release makes llvmlite compatible with Python 3.10. It
    also adds an ``abiname`` option to the target machine creation
    interface that mimics the same in LLVM. Further, a large number
    of functions are added to the IR API to support common uses of
    constant expressions. Finally, a number of bugs were fixed!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 30 09:38:41 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- update to 0.37.0
  * The biggest new feature in this release is LLVM 11
    support for all platforms! This is important, because
    the aarch64 platform had been ‘stuck’ on LLVM 9 for
    several releases. A special thanks to David Spickett
    from Linaro for supplying the relevant patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 16 19:59:54 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- update to 0.36.0
  * The main feature in this release is Python 3.9 support.
    Also, some changes to the build scripts were included:
    the llvmdev recipe now supports compilation on Windows 10
    and llvmlite may now be compiled with cmake on POSIX
    systems. Additionally, both the timings from the LLVM
    passes themselves and the time spent within the LLVM
    thread-safe access lock are now available for diagnostic
    purposes. Lastly, several minor cosmetic changes to the
    documentation and project files are included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 10:37:10 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- update to 0.35.0
  * The main feature in this release is a Numba specific
    LLVM pass for pruning reference-count operations. We
    plan to generalize this custom LLVM pass once it is
    proven stable so that it can be configured for other
    uses. In addition, this release contains an updated SVML
    patch that fixes an issue for AVX512, and a patch that
    fixes build issues on Linux and BSD.
- Drop the condtional for older llvm versions on older distros.
  This release as well as previous ones only supports llvm10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 14:56:24 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 0.34.0
  * This release upgrades to LLVM 10 and drops support for LLVM versions older than 9.
    * except aarch64, which stays on LLVM 9 for some reason
- Drop support-clang9.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 25 22:16:52 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Use default compiler (g++) instead of clang++. (boo#1174233)

    and Python <3.6, and making the code base PEP8 compliant.

Tue Jun 18 19:45:06 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- update to version 0.29.0
  * This release upgrades to LLVM 8.0 for all supported platforms except PPC64LE.
    Due to numerous problems with LLVM 8.0 running on PPC64LE,
    we have decided to use LLVM 7.1, which is more stable on PPC64LE.
    In addition, non-host LLVM targets, AMDGPU, NVPTX, and WebAssembly, are enabled
    and they are available in our `llvmlite` builds.
  * Revert "LLVM 7 changed memset intrinsic signature, adjust it"

Fri Mar 23 15:28:15 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.22.0
  * In this release, we have changed the locking strategy that
    protects LLVM from race conditions.  Before, the llvmlite user
    (like Numba) was responsible for this locking.  Now, llvmlite
    imposes a global thread lock on all calls into the LLVM API.
    This should be significantly less error prone.  Future llvmlite
    releases may manually exempt some functions from locking once
    they are determined to be thread-safe.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
