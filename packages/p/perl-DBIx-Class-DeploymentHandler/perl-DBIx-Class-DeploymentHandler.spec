%description
'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' is, as its name suggests, a tool for
deploying and upgrading databases with DBIx::Class. It is designed to be
much more flexible than DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned, hence the use of
Moose and lots of roles.

'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' itself is just a recommended set of roles
that we think will not only work well for everyone, but will also yield the
best overall mileage. Each role it uses has its own nuances and
documentation, so I won't describe all of them here, but here are a few of
the major benefits over how DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned worked (and
DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Deprecated tries to maintain compatibility
with):

  * Downgrades in addition to upgrades.

  * Multiple sql files files per upgrade/downgrade/install.

  * Perl scripts allowed for upgrade/downgrade/install.

  * Just one set of files needed for upgrade, unlike before where one might
need to generate 'factorial(scalar @versions)', which is just silly.

  * And much, much more!

That's really just a taste of some of the differences. Check out each role
for all the details.
