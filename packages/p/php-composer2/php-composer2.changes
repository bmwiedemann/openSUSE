Sun Oct 25 23:13:35 UTC 2020 - Yunhe Guo <i@guoyunhe.me>

- Version 2.0.2
  * Fixed regression handling composer show -s in projects where no
    version can be guessed from VCS
  * Fixed regression handling partial updates/require when a lock
    file was missing
  * Fixed interop issue with plugins that need to update dist URLs
    of packages
- Version 2.0.1
  * Fixed crash on PHP8
- Version 2.0.0
  * Breaking: This is a major release and while we tried to keep things
    compatible for most users, you might want to have a look at the
    UPGRADE guides
  * Many CPU and memory performance improvements
  * The update command is now much more deterministic as it does not
    take the already installed packages into account
  * Package installation now performs all network operations first
    before doing any changes on disk, to reduce the chances of ending
    up with a partially updated vendor dir
  * Partial updates and require/remove are now much faster as they
    only load the metadata required for the updated packages
  * Added a platform-check step when vendor/autoload.php gets initialized
    which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is
    expected and fails hard otherwise. Can be disabled with the
    platform-check config option
  * Added a Composer\InstalledVersions class which is autoloaded in
    every project and lets you check which packages/versions are
    present at runtime
  * Added a composer-runtime-api virtual package which you can require
    (as e.g. ^2.0) to ensure things like the InstalledVersions class
    above are present. It will effectively force people to use Composer
    2.x to install your project
  * Added support for parallel downloads of package metadata and zip
    files, this requires that the curl extension is present and we thus
    strongly recommend enabling curl
  * Added parallel installation of packages (requires OSX/Linux/WSL,
    and that unzip is present in PATH)
  * Added much clearer dependency resolution error reporting for common
    error cases
  * Added support for updating to a specific version with partial
    updates, as well as a --with flag to pass in temporary constraint
    overrides
  * Added automatic removal of packages which are not required anymore
    whenever an update is done, this will purge packages previously
    left over by partial updates and require/remove
  * Added support for TTY mode on Linux/OSX/WSL so that script handlers
    now run in interactive mode
  * Added only, exclude and canonical options to all repositories, see
    repository priorities for details
  * Added support for many new lib-* packages in the platform repository
    and improved version detection for some ext-* and lib-* packages
  * Added pre-operations-exec event to be fired before the packages get
    installed/upgraded/removed
  * Added pre-pool-create event to be fired before the package pool for
    the dependency solver is created, which lets you modify the list
    of packages going in
  * Added post-file-download event to be fired after package dist files
    are downloaded, which lets you do additional checks on the files
  * Added --locked flag to show command to see the packages from the
    composer.lock file
  * Added --unused flag to remove command to make sure any packages
    which are not needed anymore get removed
  * Added --dry-run flag to require and remove commands
  * Added --no-install flag to update, require and remove commands to
    disable the install step and only do the update step (composer.lock
    file update)
  * Added an --ask flag to create-project command to make Composer prompt
    for the install dir name, useful for project install instructions
  * Added support for multiple --repository flags being passed into
    the create-project command, only useful in combination with
    --add-repository to persist them to composer.json
  * Added --with-dependencies and --with-all-dependencies flag aliases
    to require and remove commands for consistency with update
  * Added shorthand aliases -w for --with-dependencies and -W for
    --with-all-dependencies on update/require/remove commands
  * Added more info to vendor/composer/installed.json, a dev key stores
    whether dev requirements were installed, and every package now has
    an install-path key with its install location
  * Added COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK which if set makes Composer do its
    best to run offline. This can be useful when you have poor
    connectivity or to do benchmarking without network jitter
  * Added COMPOSER_DEBUG_EVENTS=1 env var support for plugin authors
    to figure out which events are triggered when
  * Added setCustomCacheKey to PreFileDownloadEvent and fixed a cache
    bug for integrations changing the processed url of package archives
  * Added Composer\Util\SyncHelper for plugin authors to deal with
    async Promises more easily
  * Added $composer->getLoop()->getHttpDownloader() to get access to
    the main HttpDownloader instance in plugins
  * Added --json and --merge flags to config command to allow editing
    complex extra.* values by using json as input
  * Added confirmation prompt when running Composer as superuser in
    interactive mode
  * Added --no-check-version to validate command to remove the warning
    in case the version is defined
  * Added --ignore-platform-req (without s) to all commands supporting
    --ignore-platform-reqs, which accepts a package name so you can
    ignore only specific platform requirements
  * Added --no-dev support to show and outdated commands to skip dev
    requirements
  * Added --format=summary flag to license command
  * Added a cache-read-only config option to make the cache usable in
    read only mode for containers and such
  * Added support for wildcards (*) in classmap autoloader paths
  * Added support for configuring GitLab deploy tokens in addition to
    private tokens, see gitlab-token
  * Added support for package version guessing for require and init
    command to take all platform packages into account, not just php
    version
  * Added support for tar in artifact repositories
  * Added a non-zero exit code (2) and warning to remove command when
    a package to be removed could not be removed
  * Added --apcu-autoloader-prefix (or --apcu-prefix for dump-autoload
    command) flag to let people use apcu autoloading in a deterministic
    output way if that is needed
  * Fixed package ordering when autoloading and especially when loading
    plugins, to make sure dependencies are loaded before their dependents
  * Fixed suggest output being very spammy, it now is only one line
    long and shows more rarely
  * Fixed conflict rules like e.g. >=5 from matching dev-master, as
    it is not normalized to 9999999-dev internally anymore
  * Fixed solver bug resulting in endless loops in some cases
  * Lots of minor bug fixes and improvements
