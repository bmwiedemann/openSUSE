- Update to v0.45
  * Add Python 3.9 support.
  * Drop Python 3.5 support.
  * Switch from pep517 to python-build
  * Add ``--no-build-isolation`` option so check-manifest can
    succeed building pep517-based distributions without an
    internet connection.
    With --no-build-isolation, you must preinstall the
    ``build-system.requires`` beforehand.
- from v0.44
  * Try to avoid passing ``--recurse-submodules`` to ``git ls``
    if the project doesn't use git submodules (i.e. doesn't
    have a ``.gitsubmodules`` file)
    This should make check-manifest work again with older git
    versions, as long as you don't use submodules
- from v0.43
  * Fix collecting files versioned by ``git`` when a project
    has submodules and ``GIT_INDEX_FILE`` is set. This bug was
    triggered when ``check-manifest`` was run from a git hook

- Update to v0.42
  * Added ``-q``/``--quiet`` command line argument. This will reduce the
    verbosity of informational output, e.g. for use in a CI pipeline.
  * Rewrote the ignore logic to be more compatible with setuptools.  This 
    might have introduced some regressions, so please file bugs!  One side
    effect of this is that ``--ignore`` (or the ``ignore`` setting in the
    config file) is now handled the same way as ``global-exclude`` in a
    ``MANIFEST.in``, which means:
    - it's matched anywhere in the file tree
    - it's ignored if it matches a directory
  * Drop Python 2.7 support.
- from v0.41
  * Support `PEP 517`_, i.e. packages using pyproject.toml
  * Ignore subcommand stderr unless the subcommand fails.

Fri May  1 12:09:52 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Switch to multibuild and remove Suggests for bzr.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  8 18:47:22 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Don't build-require bzr, just suggest it, it is not that necessary.
- Switch tests to using pytest as a test runner.

- Update to 0.40

  * You can now use check-manifest as a pre-commit hook (#100).

- Use noun phrase in summary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  8 15:09:17 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove unnecessary bcond test
- Add optional VCS dependencies to BuildDepends and Suggests
- Use fdupes
- Revise Summary replacing confusing 'MANIFEST in' with MANIFEST.in
- Update to v0.38
  * Add Python 3.7 support
  * Drop Python 3.4 support.
  * Added GitHub templates to default ignore patterns
  * Added reading check-manifest config out of tox.ini or pyproject.toml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 19 16:45:46 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com> - 0.37

- update to version 0.37:
  * Drop Python 3.3 support.
  * Support packages using setuptools_scm (#68).
  * Note that setuptools_scm usually makes MANIFEST.in files obsolete.
    Having one is helpful only if you intend to build an sdist and then
    use that sdist to perform further builds, instead of building from
    a source checkout.
