- Update to 0.8.2
  * fix handling of Union in annotation based class definition PR
    #177
- Release 0.8.1
  * add support for Python 3.11 PR #166
- Release 0.8.0
  * This release introduced a new way to declare atom object based
    on type annotations.
  * emit warnings when a magic method points to an undefined member
    PR #139 #149
  * use isort, black and flake8 to ensure a consistent coding style
    PR #141
  * base the version number on the most recent git tag using
    setuptools-scm PR #141
  * make the setup compatible with PEP 517 and PEP 621 compliant PR
    #141 #162 Pip should be used for development install in place
    of directly calling setup.py
  + fix handling of _SpecialGenericAlias (typing.Sequence, ...)
    when used inside an Instance member PR #151
  * add a ChangeDict TypedDict to help annotate observers PR #133
  * add several keyword argument to the AtomMeta metaclass PR #133
    - enable_weakrefs: allow to have weak references to an Atom
      object without having to add the slot by hand. False by
      default.
    - use_annotations: generate members from type annotations.
      Str-like annotations are not supported but allowed when an
      actual member is provided as default value. True by default.
    - type_containers: in conjunction with use_annotations
      determine to what depth to type the content of a container.
      The default is 1 meaning that list[int] will use List(Int())
      but list[list[int]] will use List(List()).
  * allow specifying which change events are emitted when adding
    static observers PR #155

- Update to 0.7.0:
  * allow to use any subscribed type in Typed and Instance. Optional and Union are
    analyzed to extract the tuple of types to validate. The presence of NoneType in
    the tuple will make the member optional. For container types (list, dict, set, etc)
    the content types is not used beyond static type validation. PR #136 #140
    Note however that this usage of Optional and Union breaks static analyzer currently,
    while things deriving from an actual type will work as expected (List[int], list[int],
    Iterable[int])
  * make the factory argument of Typed, Instance and their forwarded version
    keyword only. PR #123
  * add a keyword-only argument to Typed, Instance and their forwarded
    version: ``optional``. When set to False, this will cause those members to
    reject None as a valid value. The default value, None, will resolve to True
    if there is no provided way to build a default value. PR #123 # 131
    This is backward incompatible since previously None was always a valid value.
  * the Instance and Typed variants of the Validate enum have been renamed to
    OptionalInstance, OptionalTyped and new Instance and Typed variant describing
    the validation behavior for the member with optional=False have been added. PR #123
  * consistently use Instance to wrap types passed to containers. PR #123
    For containers, Instance members used for validation are created with
    optional=False by default. This is backward incompatible since None was always
    a valid value previously.
  * add strict argument to FloatRange. PR #124
  * allow to specify the type of ReadOnly and Constant. PR #128
    The validation is done using the Instance validator. The change for ReadOnly
    is backward incompatible since the type or tuple of type is the first argument
    in place of the default value. Specifying the default value by keyword is both
    forward and backward compatible.
  * use python stdlib IntEnum instead of the custom one in atom  PR #122
  * remove the custom atom.IntEnum  PR #122
  * add and distribute type hints PR #122 #132
    This allows static type checkers to resolve the values behind a member.
  * drop official support for Python 3.6 and add support for Python 3.10
- Stop building on Python 3.6 which is no longer supported
