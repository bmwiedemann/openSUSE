    reprogrammed with the HMAC_LT64 flag set.
- Version 2.11 (released 2012-02-10)

    the token-to-user mapping in a multi-value attribute with
    values like "yubikey:publicid", "other-token:something" etc.
    Patch by Remi Mollon <remi.mollon@cern.ch>.
- Version 2.10 (released 2011-12-14)
  - Drop permissions (to the user that is trying to authenticate)
    before accessing files in the users home directory. Largely
    based on a patch by Ricky Zhou <ricky@fedoraproject.org>.
    Thanks!
  - Restore challenge-response support - version 2.7 was supposed
    to make the dependency on libykpers optional, but in reality
    accidentally disabled challenge-response for all
    configurations. As before, use --without-cr to compile
    pam_yubico without the ykpers dependency.
- Version 2.9 (released 2011-11-17)
  - Security: Explicitly request ykclient to verify server
    signature.  ykclient <= 2.5 strangely enough defaults to
    signing requests, but not verifying signatures in responses
    when it is supplied with a client key.  Reported and patched by
    Dominic Rutherford <dominic@rutherfordfamily.co.uk>.
- Version 2.8 (released 2011-08-26)
  - Fix big security hole: Authentication succeeded when no
    password was given, unless use_first_pass was being used.  This
    is fatal if pam_yubico is considered 'sufficient' in the PAM
    configuration.  Reported and patched by Nanakos Chrysostomos
    <nanakos@wired-net.gr>.
- Version 2.7 (released 2011-06-07)
  - Make dependency on libykpers optional.  Use --without-cr to
    force it.  Reported by Jussi Sallinen <jussi@jus.si>.
- Version 2.6 (released 2011-04-11)
  - This release includes lots of patches by members of our open
    source community. Thank you all!
  - Add Challenge-Response mode for offline validation (requires
    YubiKey 2.2). Patch by Tollef Fog Heen.
  - Eliminate all problems with pam_get_data by simply getting rid
    of that code completely. This seems to have caused problems for
    a lot of people.
  - Numerous LDAP bug fixes and improvements, including community
    patches by judas.iscariote and maxsanna81@gmail.com. Change to
    LDAPv3, since v2 has been declared historic for a looong time.
  - Support passing capath parameter to Yubico validation client.
    Patch by Remi Mollon.
  - Support public id's longer/shorter than 6 bytes. Patch by
    fraser.scott@gmail.com.
  - Convert documentation to Asciidoc format used in Github wiki.
  - Try to never log passwords in debug logs.
- new build requires:
  pkg-config
  libyubikey-devel
  libykpers-devel
- use correct license string: BSD-2-Clause
- remove autoreconf call: no longer needed with release tarball
- package more documentation
