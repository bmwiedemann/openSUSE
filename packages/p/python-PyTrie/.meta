  <title>A pure Python implementation of the trie data structure</title>
  <description>A *trie* is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a mapping
where the keys are sequences, usually strings over an alphabet. In addition to
implementing the mapping interface, tries allow finding the items for a given
prefix, and vice versa, finding the items whose keys are prefixes of a given key.</description>
