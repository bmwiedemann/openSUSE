%description
pytrie is a pure Python (2 and 3) implementation of the trie data structure.

A trie is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a mapping
where the keys are sequences, usually strings over an alphabet. In addition to
implementing the mapping interface, tries allow finding the items for a given
prefix, and vice versa, finding the items whose keys are prefixes of a given key.
