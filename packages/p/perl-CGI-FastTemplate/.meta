  <title>Perl extension for managing templates, and performing variable interpolation</title>
  <description>CGI::FastTemplate manages templates and parses templates replacing
variable names with values. It was designed for mid to large scale
web applications (CGI, mod_perl) where there are great benefits to
separating the logic of an application from the specific
implementation details.
