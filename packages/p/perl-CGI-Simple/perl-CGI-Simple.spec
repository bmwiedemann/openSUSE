%description
CGI::Simple provides a relatively lightweight drop in replacement for
CGI.pm. It shares an identical OO interface to CGI.pm for parameter
parsing, file upload, cookie handling and header generation. This module is
entirely object oriented, however a complete functional interface is
available by using the CGI::Simple::Standard module.

Essentially everything in CGI.pm that relates to the CGI (not HTML) side of
things is available. There are even a few new methods and additions to old
ones! If you are interested in what has gone on under the hood see the
Compatibility with CGI.pm section at the end.

In practical testing this module loads and runs about twice as fast as
CGI.pm depending on the precise task.
