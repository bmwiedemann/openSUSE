  <title>PulseAudio Volume Control</title>
  <description>PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume
control tool (&quot;mixer&quot;) for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to
classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of
hardware devices and of each playback stream separately.</description>
