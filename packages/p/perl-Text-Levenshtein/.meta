  <title>An implementation of the Levenshtein edit distance</title>
  <description>This module implements the Levenshtein edit distance. The Levenshtein edit
distance is a measure of the degree of proximity between two strings. This
distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or insertions (&quot;edits&quot;)
needed to transform one string into the other one (and vice versa). When two
strings have distance 0, they are the same. A good point to start is:

&amp;fastdistance can be called with two scalars and is faster in most cases.

See also Text::LevenshteinXS on CPAN if you do not require a perl-only
implementation. It is extremely faster in nearly all cases.

See also Text::WagnerFischer on CPAN for a configurable edit distance, i.e. for
configurable costs (weights) for the edits.
