%description
This is pragma to change Perl 5's standard method resolution order from
depth-first left-to-right (a.k.a - pre-order) to the more sophisticated C3
method resolution order.

*NOTE:* YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS MODULE DIRECTLY - The feature provided is
integrated into perl version >= 5.9.5, and you should use MRO::Compat
instead, which will use the core implementation in newer perls, but
fallback to using this implementation on older perls.
