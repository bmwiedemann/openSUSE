Thu May 15 05:20:40 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.0
  * Python 3.9 support has been dropped and 3.13 is now tested.
  * Checksums can now be verified when deciding to overwrite a file
    and when downloads are completed based on user or server provided
    checksums. (This is opt-in for now)
  * Add checksums support @Cadair (#165)
  * The first request to download a file will now attempt to use the
    HEAD method to read the checksum and content-disposition headers.
    If the HEAD request returns any status code other than 200 the old
    GET behaviour will be tried - Fix a 302 issue @Cadair (#170), Add a
    test for the head or get helper @Cadair (#169), Use a HEAD for the
    first request @Cadair (#168)
  * The URL associated with every downloaded file is now propagated
    through to the Results object
  * Add urls to results @samaloney (#146)
  * Fix a bug where result urls were not updated in retry @samaloney (#153)
  * Fix codecov @Cadair (#167)
  * Add type hints to _get_http @Cadair (#164)
  * Migrate away from setup.cfg and use more ruff @Cadair (#162)
  * Drop Python 3.9 as it's EOL and fix tests @Cadair (#161)
- Use Python 3.11 on SLE-15 by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Aug  2 03:16:15 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.2:
  * Vendor parse_header out of the deprecated cgi module for Python 3.11
    compatibility
  * Fix a bug where an asyncio.CancelledError was not properly caught
  * The file_progress, notebook, use_aiofiles, and header keyword arguments
    to parfive.Downloader have been removed and moved into the
    parfive.SessionConfig object.
  * The timeouts keyword argument has been removed from the run_download()
    and download() methods and replaced by an option in SessionConfig.
  * Add a new SessionConfig object to allow advanced configuration of the
    Downloader
  * Improve the CLI with more options
  * Use tqdm's auto notebook detection
  * Fix issue with small files where the size of a chunk would round down to
    0 bytes
  * Remove the default download timeout of 5 minutes for a single file
  * Cast timeout environment variables to numbers
  * Add a Downloader.simple_download method to easily download a list of
    URLs to a single directory
  * Add support for optionally using aiofiles to write files to disk.
- Switch to pyproject macros.
- Stop using greedy globs in %files.

Fri Apr  9 13:25:01 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.3.0
  * Add environment variable based options to help with debugging
    @Cadair (#70)
  * Any errors encountered downloading files are now logged to the
    built in python logging system at the INFO level @dstansby (#58)
  * Change use of ensure_future to newer create_task @1nF0rmed (#62)
  * Infra Changes @nabobalis (#68)
- Release 1.2.0
  * Make parfive.Downloader.run_download public API and move all of
    the parfive.Downloader.download logic into run_download. This
    enabled using parfive from inside an async context. (#54)
  * Handing a custom loop to Downloader now does nothing, and
    parfive spins up its own loop. This is to prepare for python
    3.10 where support for passing custom loops to various asyncio
    methods will be removed. (#53)
  * Fix a bug where downloads fail if max_conn is changed after
    construction of the parfive.Downloader instance. (#56)
- Skip python36: support ceased, no aioftp

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 07:39:57 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.0:
  * Features
    + Add concurent requests to parfive. This feature splits the download of a single file into multiple parts if the server the file is being downloaded from supports ranged requests. This should improve the performance of all downloads under these circumstances, and also make parfive useful even if downloading a single file. No changes are needed to use this feature, files will be downloaded using 12 concurrent requests by default. To change the number of concurrent requests you can pass max_splits to parfive.Downloader.enqueue_file. (#15)
    + Added CLI interface to Parfive. (#16)
    + Parfive now only supports Python 3.6+. (#22)
    + Support for specifying headers to be used for all requests to parfive.Downloader has been added. (#32)
    + Support for HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables have been added. (#32)
  * Bugfixes
    + Fix a bug where running parfive in the notebook would error if ipywidgets was not installed. (#25)
    + Remove use of the deprecated loop= keyword argument to aiohttp.ClientSession. (#30)
    + Update the notebook detection function due to changes in tqdm (#36)
    + Reduce the number of parallel connections to 25 (5 parallel files, 5 parallel downloads per file). (#37)
- Sprinkle in update-alternatives for parfive wrapper.
