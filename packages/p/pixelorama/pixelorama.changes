- Update to 1.0.5
  Some noteworthy changes from 1.0
  * The config file has been renamed from "cache.ini" to
    "config.ini". This effectively means that preferences edited in
    v0.x will not be automatically be carried over to v1.0.
  * The file format of pxo files has been changed. Pxo files are
    now zip files in disguise.
  * Similarly, the file format of Pixelorama's palette files has
    been changed from .tres back to .json as they used to be in the
    past. This change had to happen due to security concerns
    regarding Godot's resource files.

  Changes from 1.0.5:
  Added:
  * Add density to the square & circle brushes. 100% density means
    that the brush gets completely drawn. Anything less leaves gaps
    inside the brush, acting like a spray tool.
  * Selection expanding, shrinking and borders have been added as
    options in the Select menu.
  * Mouse buttons can now be used as menu shortcuts. #1070
  * Added confirm and cancel buttons in the selection tool options
    to confirm/cancel an active transformation.
  * OKHSL Lightness sorting in palettes has been implemented. #1126
  Changed:
  * The brush size no longer changes by Control + Mouse
    Wheel when resizing the timeline cels or the palette swatches.
  * Improved the UI of the Tile Mode Offsets dialog and added an
    "Isometric" preset button.
  * The Recorder panel now automatically records for the current
    project. This also allows for multiple projects to be recorded
    at the same time.
  Fixed:
  * Opening the Tile Mode Offsets dialog no longer crashes the
    application.
  * Panels no longer get scrolled when using the mouse wheel over a
    slider.
  * Fixed layer effect slider values being rounded to the nearest
    integer.
  * Fixed memory leak where the project remained referenced by a
    drawing tool, even when its tab was closed.
  * Fixed memory leak where the first project remained forever
    references in memory by the Recorder panel.
  * Slightly optimize circle brushes by only calling the ellipse
    algorithms once while drawing
  Removed:
  * The Recorder panel has been removed from the Web version. It
    wasn't functional anyway in a way that was useful, and it's
    unsure if we can find a way to make it work.
