  <title>PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.</title>
  <description>PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.

PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to execute. Then it collects copies of all those files – including the active Python interpreter! – and puts them with your script in a single folder, or optionally in a single executable file.

PyInstaller is tested against Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, it is not a cross-compiler: to make a Windows app you run PyInstaller in Windows; to make a Linux app you run it in Linux, etc. PyInstaller has been used successfully with AIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD, but is not tested against them.

Main Advantages

   - Works out-of-the-box with any Python version 2.7 / 3.3-3.5.
   - Fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.
   - Correctly bundles the major Python packages such as numpy, PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide, Django, wxPython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.
   - Compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (All the required tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)
   - Libraries like PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide, wxPython, matplotlib or Django are fully supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.
   - Working code signing on OS X.
   - Bundles MS Visual C++ DLLs on Windows.
