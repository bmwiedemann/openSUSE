- update to 9.10:
  * NEW: Blocks: Add new experimental general purpose blocks that
    provide a framework for creating fenced block containers for
    specialized parsing. A number of extensions utilizing general
    purpose blocks are included and are meant to be an alternative
    to (and maybe one day replace): Admonitions, Details,
    Definition Lists, and Tabbed. Also adds a new HTML plugin for
    quick wrapping of content with arbitrary HTML elements.
  * NEW: Highlight: When enabling line spans and/or line anchors,
    if a code block has an ID associated with it, line ids will be
    generated using that code ID instead of the code block count.
  * NEW: Snippets: Expand section syntax to allow section names
    with `-` and `_`.
  * NEW: Snippets: When check_paths is enabled, and a specified
    section is not found, raise an error.
  * NEW: Snippets: Add new experimental feature dedent_sections
    that will de-indent (remove any common leading
    whitespace from every line in text) from that block of text.
  * NEW: MagicLink: Update GitLab links to match recent changes and
    to be more correct.
  * NEW: MagicLink: Relax required hash length when performing link
    shortening.

- update to 9.9.2:
  * FIX: Snippets syntax can break in XML comments as XML comments
    do not allow --. Relax Snippets syntax such that
    -8<- (single -) are allowed.
