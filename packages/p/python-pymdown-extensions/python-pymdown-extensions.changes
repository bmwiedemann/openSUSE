- update to 10.7:
  * NEW: Emoji: Update Twemoji and Gemoji data to latest.
  * NEW: Emoji: Due to recent Gemoji update, non-standard emoji
    are no longer indexed. So emoji such as :octocat: are no
    longer resolved.
  * NEW: Highlight: Added new option default_lang which will
    cause code blocks with no language specifier to be
    highlighted with the specified default language instead of
    plain text. This affects indented code blocks and code blocks
    defined with SuperFences.
  * NEW: InlineHilite: style_plain_text can be specified with a
    language string (in addition to its previous boolean
    requirement) to treat inline code blocks with no explicit
    language specifier with a specific default language.
  * NEW: MagicLink: Allow configuring custom
    repository providers based off the existing providers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 10:45:48 UTC 2023 - Elisei Roca <eroca@mailbox.org>

    custom block classes and default titles.

    support interactions with MkDocs.

    properly in attributes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 07:08:13 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 10.1.0:
  * NEW: Add new combine_header_slug option in legacy Tabbed
    extension and new Block Tab extension that will
    prefix a content tab's slug with the parent header's slug. This
    allows for content tab slugs that are scoped to the
    header they are under.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 07:07:05 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 10.0.1:

    specified base path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 07:05:48 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 10.0:
  * Break: Snippets: snippets will restrict snippets to ensure they
    are under the base_path preventing snippets relative to the
    base_path but not explicitly under it. restrict_base_path can
    be set to False for legacy behavior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 24 12:19:08 UTC 2023 - Elisei Roca <eroca@mailbox.org>

- require python-PyYAML from requirements/project.txt

- update to 9.11:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 17 07:29:00 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 9.10:
  * NEW: Blocks: Add new experimental general purpose blocks that
    provide a framework for creating fenced block containers for
    specialized parsing. A number of extensions utilizing general
    purpose blocks are included and are meant to be an alternative
    to (and maybe one day replace): Admonitions, Details,
    Definition Lists, and Tabbed. Also adds a new HTML plugin for
    quick wrapping of content with arbitrary HTML elements.
  * NEW: Highlight: When enabling line spans and/or line anchors,
    if a code block has an ID associated with it, line ids will be
    generated using that code ID instead of the code block count.
  * NEW: Snippets: Expand section syntax to allow section names
    with `-` and `_`.
  * NEW: Snippets: When check_paths is enabled, and a specified
    section is not found, raise an error.
  * NEW: Snippets: Add new experimental feature dedent_sections
    that will de-indent (remove any common leading
    whitespace from every line in text) from that block of text.
  * NEW: MagicLink: Update GitLab links to match recent changes and
    to be more correct.
  * NEW: MagicLink: Relax required hash length when performing link
    shortening.

- update to 9.9.2:
  * FIX: Snippets syntax can break in XML comments as XML comments
    do not allow --. Relax Snippets syntax such that
    -8<- (single -) are allowed.
