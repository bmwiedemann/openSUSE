  <title>Modules for working with AX.25 packets in an amateur packet radio env</title>
  <description>The ax25 and ax25.netrom modules provide structure definitions together with
methods to pack and unpack native AX.25 frames and NET/ROM routing table
updates. These modules work on all platforms, and can be used together with
the transport mechanism(s) of your choice.

The ax25.ports and ax25.socket modules provide facilities for working with
the Linux native AX.25 stack. Unlike other Python AX.25 packages, this includes
the creation and use of connected-mode sessions, and thus it is not limited to
unproto (UI frame) usage.</description>
