- New upstream release 0.7.1

  * Fix license to LGPL 2.1 and later
  * Add keyring for source verification

  Changelog:

  Major change: drop compatibility with Python 2, which allows significant code
  cleanups.

  Other changes:

  * Switch internal implementation of argument parsing to a built-in one
    (`PyUnicode_FSConverter`), which brings automatic support for
    path-like objects in Python 3.6+ (#20), and also a more uniform
    handling of Unicode path arguments with respect to other Python code.
  * Fix missing error check in list operations in `get_all` (#17).
  * Switch test library to pytest; not that a reasonable recent version is
    needed. Additionally, expand test coverage, although not directly
    visible in actual coverage reports…
