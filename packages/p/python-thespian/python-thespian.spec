%description
Thespian is a Python library providing a framework for developing
concurrent, distributed, fault tolerant applications.

Thespian is built on the Actor Model which allows applications to be
written as a group of independently executing but cooperating
"Actors" which communicate via messages.  These Actors run within
the Actor System provided by the Thespian library.

      * Concurrent
      * Distributed
      * Fault Tolerant
      * Scalable
      * Location independent

Actor programming is broadly applicable and it is ideally suited
for Cloud-based applications as well, where compute nodes are
added and removed from the environment dynamically.
