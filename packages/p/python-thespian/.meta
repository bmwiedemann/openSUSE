  <title>Python Actor concurrency library</title>
  <description>Thespian is a Python library providing a framework for developing concurrent, distributed, fault tolerant applications.

Thespian is built on the Actor Model which allows applications to be written as a group of independently executing but cooperating “Actors” which communicate via messages. These Actors run within the Actor System provided by the Thespian library.</description>
