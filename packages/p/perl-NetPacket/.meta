  <title>Assemble/disassemble network packets at the protocol level</title>
  <description>&quot;NetPacket&quot; provides a base class for a cluster of modules related to
decoding and encoding of network protocols. Each &quot;NetPacket&quot; descendent
module knows how to encode and decode packets for the network protocol it
implements. Consult the documentation for the module in question for
protocol-specific implementation.
Note that there is no inheritance in the &quot;NetPacket::&quot; cluster of modules
other than each protocol module being a &quot;NetPacket&quot;. This was seen to be
too restrictive as imposing inheritance relationships (for example between
the IP, UDP and TCP protocols) would make things like tunneling or other
unusual situations difficult.</description>
