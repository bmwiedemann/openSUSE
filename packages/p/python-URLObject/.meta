  <title>A utility class for manipulating URLs</title>
  <description>URLObject is a utility class for manipulating URLs. The latest incarnation of this library builds upon the ideas of its predecessor, but aims for a clearer API, focusing on proper method names over operator overrides. It's also being developed from the ground up in a test-driven manner, and has full Sphinx documentation.</description>
