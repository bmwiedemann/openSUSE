.SH NAME
pmacct \- frontend to pmacctd.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmacct
\fIquery\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmacct
is a frontend to
.BR pmacctd (8)
when used in volatile memory mode.
.PP
The type of query is specified using options.
At least one of the options
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-e\fR, \fB\-s\fR, or \fB\-t\fR
is mandatory, but with \fB\-c\fR either of \fB\-M\fR or
\fB\-N\fR must be used for further specification.

.SH OPTIONS
For displaying data either of these options are used:
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Show full statistics.
.TP
\fB\-c \fI aggregate\fR
Specify primitives in a match aggregation, in order to present 
partial statistics. Either \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-N\fR must be used
to specify matching data for this option. Here \fI aggregate\fR
is a comma separated string constructed from the following
identifiers, in arbitrary order:

src_mac, dst_mac, vlan, src_host, dst_host, src_net, dst_net,
src_mask, dst_mask, src_port, dst_port, tos, proto, src_as,
dst_as, sum_mac, sum_host, sum_net, sum_as, sum_port, in_iface,
out_iface, tag, tag2, flows, class, std_comm, ext_comm, as_path,
peer_src_ip, peer_dst_ip, peer_src_as, peer_dst_as, src_as_path,
src_std_comm, src_med, src_ext_comm, src_local_pref, is_symmetric.

Only entries which match the aggregate are printed.
.PP
Management of the server daemon is offered by three options:

.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Clear all statistics. For a partial clear, see \fB\-r\fR.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Show memory table status.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
Show a table of all active classifiers.

.SH MODIFIERS
The primary options above can be influenced by some secondary options:
.TP
\fB\-p \fR \fI file\fR
Unix socket location for client\-server communication. Default is
\fI/tmp/collect.pipe\fR.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Display all table fields, even currently unused fields.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR
Calculate a summed total of all counters, instead of returning
a counter for each individual match; applies to \fB\-N\fR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR {bytes|packets|flows|all}
Select which counters to print. This applies only to \fB\-N\fR.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR {bytes|packets|flows}
Output statistics ordered by decreasing value of the indicated field.
This option applies to \fB\-M\fR and to \fB\-s\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Reset counters in the present selection after printing their values.
The option applies only to \fB\-M\fR and to \fB\-N\fR.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Perform a locking on the table.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR {\fImatch_data\fR | file:\fIfilename\fR}
Print a formatted table for all entries matching the given data.
An aggregation must be specified using \fB\-c\fR, and the field
order given there must be observed when stating the data here.
The output can be influenced using \fB\-T\fR.
.IP
Here \fImatch_data\fR is a number of substrings separated by
semicolon, each substring being a comma separated list of acceptable
values in a match aggregation. A wildcard \'*\' can be used
to match any value in a specific field.
.IP
As an alternative, a location \fIfilename\fR of a file can be
specified. This file provides the substrings mentioned above
as separate lines. The prefix \'file:\' is a verbatim marker.

.TP
\fB\-N \fI {\fImatch_data\fR | file:\fIfilename\fT}
Print counters only, no text fields, header, or footer.
This presupposes \fB\-c\fR, and can be influenced by \fB\-n\fR
and \fB\-S\fR.  The arguments are identical to those for \fB\-M\fR.
