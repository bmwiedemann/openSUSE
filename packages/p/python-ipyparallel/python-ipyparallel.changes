Mon Nov 15 18:28:22 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Skip flaky imap_infinite test

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 14 15:42:52 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.0.0
  * This is marked as a major revision because of the change to
    pass connection information via environment variables.
    BatchSystem launchers with a custom template will need to make
    sure to set flags that inherit environment variables, such as
    #PBS -V or #SBATCH --export=ALL.
  * More convenient Cluster(engines="mpi") signature for setting
    the engine (or controller) launcher class.
  * The first (and usually only) engine set can be accessed as
    .Cluster.engine_set, rather than digging through the
    Cluster.engines dict.
  * Add environment configuration to all Launchers.
  * Support more configuration via environment variables, including
    passing connection info to engines via $IPP_CONNECTION_INFO,
    which is used by default, avoiding the need to send connection
    files to engines in cases of non-shared filesystems.
  * Launchers send connection info to engines via
    $IPP_CONNECTION_INFO by default. This is governed by
    Cluster.send_engines_connection_env, which is True by default.
  * Support EngineLauncher.get_output via output files in batch
    system launchers
  * Capture output in Batch launchers by setting output file
    options in the default templates.
  * LoadBalancedView.imap returns a LazyMapIterator which has a
    .cancel() method, for stopping consumption of the map input.
  * Support for return_when argument in .AsyncResult.wait and
    ~.AsyncResult.wait_interactive, to allow returning on the first
    error, first completed, or (default) all completed.
  * LoadBalancedView.imap(max_outstanding=n) limits the number of
    tasks submitted to the cluster, instead of limiting the number
    not-yet-consumed. Prior to this, the cluster could be idle if
    several results were waiting to be consumed.
  * output streamed by %%px includes errors and results, for
    immediate feedback when only one engine fails.
  * Various bugs preventing use of non-default Controller launchers
  * Fixed crash in jupyterlab extension when IPython directory does
    not exist
  * ViewExecutor.shutdown() waits for imap results, like Executors
    in the standard library
  * Removed spurious jupyterlab plugin options that had no effect.
  * %autopx streams output just like %%px
  * Add BroadcastView benchmark code
  * Tag releases with tbump

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 17 18:51:14 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 7.1.0
  * New Client.start_and_connect() method for starting a cluster
    and returning a connected client in one call.
  * Support CurveZMQ for transport-level encryption and
    authentication. See security docs for more info.
  * Define _max_workers attribute on view.executor for better
    consistency with standard library Executors.
  * Client.wait_for_engines() will raise an informative error if
    the parent Cluster object notices that its engines have halted
    while waiting, or any engine unregisters, rather than
    continuing to wait for engines that will never come
  * Show progress if %px is taking significant time
  * Improved support for streaming output, e.g. with %px, including
    support for updating output in-place with standard terminal
    carriage-return progress bars.
  * Fix dropped IOPub messages when using large numbers of engines,
    causing AsyncResult.wait_for_output() to hang.
  * Use absolute paths for Cluster.profile_dir, fixing issues with
    Cluster.from_file() when run against a profile created with a
    relative location, e.g. Cluster(profile_dir="./profile")
  * Fix error waiting for connection files when controller is
    started over ssh.
- Release 7.0.1
  * Fix missing setupbase.py in tarball
- Release 7.0.0
  * Require Python 3.6
  * Fix compatibility issues with ipykernel 6 and jupyter-client 7
  * Remove dependency on deprecated ipython-genutils
  * New dependencies on psutil, entrypoints, tqdm
  * New Cluster API for managing clusters from Python, including
    support for signaling and restarting engines. See docs for
    more.
  * New ipcluster list and ipcluster clean commands derived from
    the Cluster API.
  * New Client.send_signal() for sending signals to single engines.
  * New KernelNanny process for signaling and monitoring engines
    for improved responsiveness of handing engine crashes.
  * New prototype BroadcastScheduler with vastly improved scaling
    in ‘do-on-all’ operations on large numbers of engines, c/o
    Tom-Olav Bøyum’s Master’s thesis at University of Oslo.
    Broadcast view documentation.
  * New Client.wait_for_engines() method to wait for engines to be
    available.
  * Nicer progress bars for interactive waits, such as
    AsyncResult.wait_interactive().
  * Add AsyncResult.stream_output() context manager for streaming
    output. Stream output by default in parallel magics.
  * Launchers registered via entrypoints for better support of
    third-party Launchers.
  * New JupyterLab extension (enabled by default) based on
    dask-labextension for managing clusters.
  * LoadBalancedView.imap() consumes inputs as-needed, producing a
    generator of results instead of an AsyncMapResult, allowing for
    consumption of very large or infinite mapping inputs.
  * Greatly improved performance of heartbeat and registration with
    large numbers of engines, tested with 5000 engines and default
    configuration.
  * Single IPController.ports configuration to specify the pool of
    ports for the controller to use, e.g. ipcontroller --ports
    10101-10120.
  * Allow f as keyword-argument to apply, e.g. view.apply(myfunc,
    f=5).
  * joblib backend will start and stop a cluster by default if the
    default cluster is not running.

Thu Mar 30 19:24:51 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 6.0.2
  * Upload fixed sdist for 6.0.1.
- Update to 6.0.1
  * Small encoding fix for Python 2.
- Update to 6.0
  * Due to a compatibility change and semver, this is a major release. However, it is not a big release.
  * The main compatibility change is that all timestamps are now timezone-aware UTC timestamps.
  * This means you may see comparison errors if you have code that uses datetime objects without timezone info (so-called naïve datetime objects).
  *  Rename :meth:`Client.become_distributed` to :meth:`Client.become_dask`.
    :meth:`become_distributed` remains as an alias.
  *  import joblib from a public API instead of a private one
    when using IPython Parallel as a joblib backend.
  *  Compatibility fix in extensions for security changes in notebook 4.3
- Update to 5.2
  *  Fix compatibility with changes in ipykernel 4.3, 4.4
  *  Improve inspection of ``@remote`` decorated functions
  *  :meth:`Client.wait` accepts any Future.
  *  Add ``--user`` flag to :command:`ipcluster nbextension`
  *  Default to one core per worker in :meth:`Client.become_distributed`.
    Override by specifying `ncores` keyword-argument.
  *  Subprocess logs are no longer sent to files by default in :command:`ipcluster`.
- Update to 5.1
  * IPython Parallel 5.1 adds integration with other parallel computing tools,
    such as `dask.distributed <https://distributed.readthedocs.io>`_ and `joblib <https://pythonhosted.org/joblib>`__.
  * IPython parallel now supports the notebook-4.2 API for enabling server extensions,
    to provide the IPython clusters tab
      jupyter serverextension enable --py ipyparallel
      jupyter nbextension install --py ipyparallel
      jupyter nbextension enable --py ipyparallel
    though you can still use the more convenient single-call::
      ipcluster nbextension enable
    which does all three steps above.
  * `Slurm <https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/linux_clusters>`_ support is added to ipcluster.
- Update to 5.0.1
  *  Fix imports in :meth:`use_cloudpickle`, :meth:`use_dill`.
  *  Various typos and documentation updates to catch up with 5.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 13:00:52 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
- update to version 5.0.0:
  * The highlight of ipyparallel 5.0 is that the Client has been
    reorganized a bit to use Futures. AsyncResults are now a Future
    subclass, so they can be `yield`ed in coroutines, etc. Views have
    also received an Executor interface. This rewrite better connects
    results to their handles, so the Client.results cache should no
    longer grow unbounded.
    + The Executor API :class:`ipyparallel.ViewExecutor`
    + Creating an Executor from a Client:
      :meth:`ipyparallel.Client.executor`
    + Each View has an :attr:`executor` attribute
  * Part of the Future refactor is that Client IO is now handled in a
    background thread, which means that :meth:`Client.spin_thread` is
    obsolete and deprecated.
  * Other changes:
    + Add :command:`ipcluster nbextension enable|disable` to toggle
    the clusters tab in Jupyter notebook
  * Less interesting development changes for users: Some
    IPython-parallel extensions to the IPython kernel have been moved
    to the ipyparallel package:
    + :mod:`ipykernel.datapub` is now :mod:`ipyparallel.datapub`
    + ipykernel Python serialization is now in
      :mod:`ipyparallel.serialize`
    + apply_request message handling is implememented in a Kernel
      subclass, rather than the base ipykernel Kernel.
- update to version 4.1.0:
  * Add :meth:`.Client.wait_interactive`
  * Improvements for specifying engines with SSH launcher.
- Split documentation into own subpackage to speed up builds.
