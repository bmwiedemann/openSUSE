  <title>generic web front-end with demo app</title>
  <description>This distro contains a generic framework for developing web front-ends to REST resources. The framework includes a web server (based on Plack and Web::Machine), CSS and HTML for the &quot;frame&quot; where the application displays its screens, and &quot;widgets&quot; for defining the application's login dialog, menus, forms, and actions. 

For illustration, the distro contains a demo app that works with App::Dochazka::REST.
