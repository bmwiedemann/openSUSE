    <comment>dep of starlette, which is a test dep of Authlib, which is already in d-l-py without test being run, Authlib was introduced in https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825427 , which said &quot;tox based tests, require internet connection to run&quot; but of course that is not true, it just depends on a long chain of missing dependencies that are present in Fedora already. https://repology.org/project/python:starlette/versions
Also a dep of fastapi (https://repology.org/project/python:fastapi/versions) and other modern web aio frameworks</comment>
