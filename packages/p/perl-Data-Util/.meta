  <title>A selection of utilities for data and data types</title>
  <description>This module provides utility functions for data and data types, including
functions for subroutines and symbol table hashes (stashes).

The implementation of this module is both Pure Perl and XS, so if you have
a C compiler, all the functions this module provides are really faster.

There are many benchmarks in the _DIST-DIR/benchmark/_ directory.</description>
