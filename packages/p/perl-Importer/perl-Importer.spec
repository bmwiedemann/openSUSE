%description
This module acts as a layer between Exporter and modules which consume
exports. It is feature-compatible with Exporter, plus some much needed
extras. You can use this to import symbols from any exporter that follows
Exporters specification. The exporter modules themselves do not need to use
or inherit from the Exporter module, they just need to set '@EXPORT' and/or
other variables.
