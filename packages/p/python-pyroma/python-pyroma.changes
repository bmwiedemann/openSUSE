Mon Mar 25 04:06:17 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 4.2:
  * Fall back to installing project's build backend in an isolated
    environment if a compatible version isn't installed in the current env
  * Fix metadata extraction failure when project ``long_description`` is
    included as a header rather than a payload in the ``METADTA`` file
  * Add a fallback to restore compatibility with Setuptools <61
  * Add ``python_requires``, update classifiers, add implicit dependencies
    and remove unused deps in Pyroma's own packaging metadata
  * Moved from a custom trove classifiers list to using the
    trove-classifiers package
  * Support checking the Requires-Python metadata
  * Silence noisy build backend output when building metadata
  * Official support for Python 3.11
  * Some string formatting bugs
  * Now follows black and flake8 rules
  * Check if author_email field contains author name
  * The deprecation test for test_suite is no longer needed, as the patched
    setuptools method of gathering metadata as a whole is deprecated.
  * `description_content_type` also needs a mapping in the metadata map.
  * Added support for PEP517 by using `build` to build the metadata as a
    preferred build method over the old patched setuptools method.
  * Add a deprecation for `test_suite`
  * Fixed __getattr__-related crash in tests with python3.7
  * Added support for pre-commit
  * Rewrote parts of the PyPI support, to avoid using the xmlrpc API,
    since it's being heavily rate-limited at the moment. Only one call
    is using it now, which seems to work fine.
  * Backwards incompatible change: As a result of the above change, when
    looking for packages on PyPI, the package name must now be spelled
    exactly correct, including capitalization.
  * Added --quiet option to output only the rating
  * Pyroma is now an executable module, and can be called with
    `python -m pyroma`
- Switch to pyproject and pytest macros.
- No more greedy globs in %files.
- Remove a few unneeded words from the Summary.
