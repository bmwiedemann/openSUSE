%description
This is a small library for generating railroad diagrams (like what JSON.org uses)
using SVG, with both JS and Python ports.

Railroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar in a form that is more
readable than using regular expressions or BNF. They can easily represent any
context-free grammar, and some more powerful grammars. There are several railroad-diagram
generators out there, but none of them had the visual appeal I wanted, so I wrote my own.
