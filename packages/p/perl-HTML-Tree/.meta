  <title>Build and scan parse-trees of HTML</title>
  <description>HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of HTML
source. It consists of mainly two modules, whose documentation you should
refer to: HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element.

HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees. (It uses
HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up into tokens.)

The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the class
HTML::Element.

If you find that you do not properly understand the documentation for
HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element, it may be because you are unfamiliar
with tree-shaped data structures, or with object-oriented modules in
general. Sean Burke has written some articles for _The Perl Journal_
('www.tpj.com') that seek to provide that background. The full text of
those articles is contained in this distribution, as:

* HTML::Tree::AboutObjects

  &quot;User's View of Object-Oriented Modules&quot; from TPJ17.

* HTML::Tree::AboutTrees

  &quot;Trees&quot; from TPJ18

* HTML::Tree::Scanning

  &quot;Scanning HTML&quot; from TPJ19

Readers already familiar with object-oriented modules and tree-shaped data
structures should read just the last article. Readers without that
background should read the first, then the second, and then the third.
