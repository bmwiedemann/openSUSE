- Update to version 0.3.0
  * The plugin now uses JupyterLab instead of Jupyter 
    Notebook to render notebooks. This ensures that the new 
    features developed by the Jupyter team, such as drag 
    and drop to reorder code cells, are available in 
    Spyder.
  * Support for Python 2 is dropped. The plugin now 
    requires Python 3.5 and Spyder 3.1 or later.
  * Notebooks are rendered in a dark theme if Spyder is 
    run using a dark theme.
  * A new item, "Server Info", in the option menu of the 
    plugin. This should help with troubleshooting in case 
    of problems.
  * Translations for Brazilian Portuguese, German and 
    Spanish are now available.
  * When you open Spyder, the plugin will open the 
    notebooks that were open when you last quit Spyder.
