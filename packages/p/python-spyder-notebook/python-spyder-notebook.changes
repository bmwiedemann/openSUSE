- Update to version 0.3.2
  New Features
  * Pressing Shift-Tab now shows the documentation of 
    functions and so on, as in a Jupyter server (Issue 315, PR 
     344)
  * Add an option to Preferences so that you can now have 
    Spyder in a dark theme and notebooks in a light theme, or 
    vice versa (Issue 310, PR 345)
  * Shift-RightClick now shows the browser menu, which allows you to save a plot as a picture (Issue 279, PR 349)
  Bug Fixes
  * Opening a link from a notebook now opens the 
    correct page in your web browser (Issue 185, PR 351)
  * If you change the Python interpreter in the Preferences, 
    then notebooks opened afterwards will use the new 
    environment; previously, you had to restart Spyder (Issue 
    266, PR 352)
  * Update error message when server fails so that it is 
    more helpful (Issue 337, PR 347)
  * Prevent an AttributeError exception when saving or 
    closing notebooks (Issue 311, Issue 333, PR 334)
  * Make saving more robust by waiting longer if necessary 
    (Issue 339, PR 348)
- Changelog for Version 0.3.1
  Bug Fixes
  * Fix compatibility issue which prevented the plugin from 
    working at all if traitlets version 5 is installed (Issue 
    314, PR 326).
  * Add background to code completions to make them visible 
    (Issue 318, PR 329).
  * Make strings brighter in dark mode to increase 
    legibility (Issue 319, PR 331).
  * Prevent JSONDecodeError when closing notebook (Issue 
    317, PR 332).
- Build only for primary interpreter as spyder does the same

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  5 18:17:01 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Rename built package to python-spyder-notebook
  * The `Requires:` tags were in the wrong place. The 
    spyder-notebook package did not specify its dependencies.
- Drop spyder-notebook-destroyqtwidgets.patch
  * No segfault after test anymore. Apparently a fix in a 
    dependency package
  * gh#pytest-dev/pytest-qt#319

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 17:45:33 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.3.0
  * The plugin now uses JupyterLab instead of Jupyter 
    Notebook to render notebooks. This ensures that the new 
    features developed by the Jupyter team, such as drag 
    and drop to reorder code cells, are available in 
    Spyder.
  * Support for Python 2 is dropped. The plugin now 
    requires Python 3.5 and Spyder 3.1 or later.
  * Notebooks are rendered in a dark theme if Spyder is 
    run using a dark theme.
  * A new item, "Server Info", in the option menu of the 
    plugin. This should help with troubleshooting in case 
    of problems.
  * Translations for Brazilian Portuguese, German and 
    Spanish are now available.
  * When you open Spyder, the plugin will open the 
    notebooks that were open when you last quit Spyder.
