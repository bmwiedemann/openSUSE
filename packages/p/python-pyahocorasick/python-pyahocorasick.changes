- Update to version 2.1.0
  * Drop support for Python 3.6 and 3.7. Use older version for
    pre-built wheels. Note that it may work on these older version,
    we are just no longer supporting and testing these Python versions.
  * Add support for Python 3.12
- from version 2.0.0
  * Drop support for Python 2
  * Drop support for 32 bits OSes
  * Re-organize code such that sources are under src/, utilities
    under etc/ and tests are under tests/
  * Use pytest for testing and streamline tests to use a more conventional
    Python approach
  * Build more compatible Linux wheels using "ci-build-wheel"
- Restrict package to 64-bit architectures as 32-bit architectures
  are no longer supported upstream and the testsuite fails on these
- Split off tests into separate -test package
- Switch package to modern Python Stack on SLE-15
  * Use Python 3.11 on SLE-15 by default
  * Drop support for older Python versions
- Switch build system from setuptools to pyproject.toml
