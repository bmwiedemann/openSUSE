%description
**pyahocorasick** is a fast and memory efficient library for exact or
approximate multi-pattern string search meaning that you can find
multiple key strings occurrences at once in some input text.  The
library provides an `ahocorasick` Python module that you can use as
a plain dict-like Trie or convert a Trie to an automaton for efficient
Aho-Corasick search.

It is implemented in C and tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4+. It works on
Linux, Mac and Windows.

The license is BSD-3-clause. Some utilities, such as tests and the pure
Python automaton are dedicated to the Public Domain.
