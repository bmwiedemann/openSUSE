- update to 1.3.0:
  * Added:
    - Add partial address expansion in IPNetwork via the
      expand_partial switch, this enables opting into pre-1.1.0
      behavior
  * Fixed:
    - Fix running the test suite on musl systems
    - Fix IPAddress IPv6 parsing with ZEROFILL enabled
    - Fix handling of the NOHOST flag in the IPNetwork copy
      constructor

Thu Mar 21 09:13:43 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * Fix bad version 1.2.0 upload to PyPI – now yanked. No changes to
    the package.
- 1.2.0:
  * Add CLI tool subcommand to display cli-network-info.
  * Support running interactive-shell without IPython installed.
  * Explicitly raise TypeError is a non-string value is passed to
    valid_ipv4 or valid_ipv6.
- 1.1.0:
  * Add the required Python version to the package metadata (#365).
  * Add expand_partial_ipv4_address to the public API.
  * Fix IPNetwork(...) in IPRange(...) false negatives (#157).
  * Fix a few IPNetwork slicing edge cases (#214).
  * Fix support for partial IP addresses accidentally left in IPNetwork in 1.0.0.
  * Fixed an incorrect license classifier in the package metadata.
- 1.0.0:
  * Removed:
    * Drop support for Python versions lower than 3.7.
    * Remove the flag shorthands: N, P and Z. Use NOHOST, INET_PTON
      and ZEROFILL instead.
    * Remove abbreviated CIDR format support in IPNetwork (implicit_prefix=True),
      use cidr_abbrev_to_verbose if you need this behavior.
    * Remove the IPAddress.is_private method.
  * Changed:
    * Stop accepting leading zeros when parsing IPv4 addresses in INET_PTON mode
      (it's been allowed on some platforms).
    * Stop parsing IPv4 addresses permissively (inet_aton()-like) by default.
    * Apply the two changes above to valid_ipv4 as well.
    * Update the address databases to the 2024-02-10 versions.

    :data:`ZEROFILL` flag.
  * Raise an exception if invalid flags are passed to
    ``IPAddress``, ``IPNetwork`` or ``IPRange``.

Wed Oct  6 01:41:45 UTC 2010 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 0.7.5:
  * Python 3.x is now fully supported. The paint is still drying on this so
    please help with testing and raise bug tickets when you find any issues!
  * Moved code hosting to github. All history ported thanks to the most
    excellent tool, svn2git (http://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git).
  * All netaddr objects now use approx. 65% less memory due to the use of
    __slots__ in classes throughout the codebase. Thanks to Stefan Nordhausen
   and his Python guru for this suggestion!
  * Applied many optimisations and speedups throughout the codebase.
  * Fixed the behaviour of the IPNetwork constructor so it now behaves in
    a much more sensible and expected way (i.e. no longer uses inet_aton
    semantics which is just plain odd for network addresses).
  * One minor change to behaviour in this version is that the .value property
    on IPAddress and IPNetwork objects no longer support assignment using a
    string IP address. Only integer value assignments are now valid. The impact
    of this change should be minimal for the majority of users.
  * FIXED Issue 49 - http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/issues/detail?id=49
    - Incorrect IP range recognition on IPs with leading zeros
  * FIXED Issue 50 - http://code.google.com/p/netaddr/issues/detail?id=50
