  <title>Pythonic manipulation of IPv4, IPv6, CIDR, EUI and MAC network addresses</title>
  <description>A pure Python network address representation and manipulation library.

netaddr provides a Pythonic way of working with:
    - IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets (including CIDR notation);
    - MAC (Media Access Control) addresses in multiple formats;
    - IEEE EUI-64, OUI and IAB identifiers;
    - a user friendly IP glob-style format.

Included are routines for:
    - generating, sorting and summarizing IP addresses;
    - converting IP addresses and ranges between various different formats;
    - performing set based operations on groups of IP addresses and subnets;
    - arbitrary IP address range calculations and conversions;
    - querying IEEE OUI and IAB organisational information;
    - querying of IP standards related data from key IANA data sources.</description>
