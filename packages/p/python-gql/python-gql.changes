- update to 3.5.2:
  * Now supporting graphql-core v3.2.4 again (See issue #534)
    - Allow graphql-core 3.2.4 by retrofitting introspection
      commits #535
- update to 3.5.1:
  Issue #529 reported that by default the AIOHTTPTransport was not
  validating ssl certificates (a self-certificate was accepted by
  default).
  This version adds a warning to warn users (See PR #533).
  As a workaround, using ssl=True in the transport arguments fix
  the issue.
  graphql-core has been restricted to <3.2.4 to fix tests.
  A new stable version will be made shortly.
