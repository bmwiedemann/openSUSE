- update to 5.1.0:
  * Improve the performance of `hash128()`, `hash64()`, and
    `hash_bytes()` by using METH_FASTCALL, reducing the overhead
     of function calls
  * Drop support for Python 3.8, as it has reached the end of
    life on 2024-10-07
  * Fix the issue that the package cannot be built from the
    source distribution
  * Add support for Python 3.13.
  * Improve the performance of the `hash()` function with
  * METH_FASTCALL, reducing the overhead of function calls. For
    data sizes between 1–2 KB (e.g., 48x48 favicons), performance
    is 10%–20% faster. For smaller data (~500 bytes,
    like 16x16 favicons), performance increases by approximately 30%
  * Add `digest` functions that support the new buffer protocol
