- bsc#1205433 Update to 1.8.3:
  * Fix CVE-2022-45197: missing certificate hostname validation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 01:06:59 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.8.2
  - Improve error handling for certificate errors
  - Add an XEP-0454 implementation (OMEMO Media sharing)
  - Fix support for RFC 3920 sessions 

- Update to version 1.8.1
  * Fix a mypy issue, a test issue, and do not enable defusedxml unless
    explicitly asked.

- Update to version 1.8.0 
   * The most important part of this release is that it fixes compatibility with
   python 3.10, but there are also plenty of changes and bugfixes!
   Many XEPs have been modified to accomodate an internal change, and as a
   result their public APIs have been modified. Slixmpp has an "internal API"
   for plugins, inherited from SleekXMPP which allows users of the library to
   substitute internal functions with their own, in order to e.g. provide a
   different storage backend (many default to in-memory), etc. This API has
   always been synchronous, which is not ideal in an asyncio library, and puts
   huge limits on what is possible to do.

   This change makes it possible to use async functions with the internal API,
   and as a result it forces us to change XEPs using this API to async in the
   relevant methods.

   As a rule of thumb, thin wrappers around del/set are generally preserved and return a
   future to guarantee that the task is done, while getters (which would require awaiting
   anyway when returning a future) are now pure coroutines. This inconsistency is a
   tradeoff to prevent wider changes across slixmpp internals and programs using it.

     - XEP-0012, Last Activity:
      - `begin_idle`, `end_idle`, `start_uptime`, `set_last_activity`,
        `del_last_activity` now return futures.
      - XEP-0027: GPG
      - `get_keyids` and `get_keyid` are now coroutines.
      - `set_keyid` and `del_keyid` now return a Future.
     - XEP-0030: Disco
      - `supports`, `has_identity`, `get_info`, `get_items` are now coroutines
      - `set_info``set_items`, `del_items`, `add_item`, `add_identity`,
        `del_identity`, `set_identities`, `del_identities`, `add_feature`,
        `del_feature`, `set_feature`, `set_features`, `del_features`
        now return a Future
     - XEP-0054: Vcard-Temp
      - `get_vcard`, `publish_vcard` are now coroutines.
     - XEP-0095: Stream Initiation
      - `accept` and `decline` are now coroutines.
     - XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities
      - `get_verstring`, `get_caps` are now coroutines.
      - `assign_verstring`, `cache_caps` now return a Future.
     - XEP-0128: Extended disco
      - `set_extended_info`, `add_extended_info` and `del_extended_info` return Futures.
     - XEP-0231: BoB
      - `get_bob` and `set_bob` are now coroutines.
      - `del_bob` returns a Future.
     - XEP-0319: Idle
      - `idle` and `active` are now coroutines.

   XMLStream.process() is now deprecated, and will be removed in the next version.
   This shorthand makes things more confusing for new users, and complicates
   integration with other asyncio libraries.

   - If defusedxml is available, it will be used, to mitigate XML parser vulns

   - `XMLStream.ca_certs` should be a list of paths to the CA certificates

   Nicoco (Nicolas Cedilnik) contributed an implementation of XEP-0356
   (privileged entities), and XEP-100 (gateway interaction).

   The Form element (`{jabber:x:data}x`) can now be accessed properly if their are
   several available in a parent element, through a 'forms' multi attribute.

   - Add an async join method (returns once the rooms is properly joined, or
     raises on error).
   - Deprecate the old join_muc() API

   Nicoco added the possibility to register with components to the existing
   XEP-0077 implementation.

   - MAM preferences have been split into an XEP-0441 plugin.
   - Tests have been added
   - An `iterate()` method has been added, which should be easier to use.

  - XEP-0369: add events for participant and channels
  - XEP-0405: Add a method to retrieve annotated roster items
  - Add a simple MIX bot

  - Make `StanzaBase.get_plugin` a public API, so that slixmpp users can check
    for the existence of a substanza without risking to create it.

  - Change the sphinx theme to [Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) which
    has a dark mode, and looks good. See
    [slixmpp.readthedocs.io](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io).

  - Improve the toctree to be more logical
  - Update obsolete documentation and tutorials (and add some)
  - Update the event index
  - Add the proper XEP title instead of the number to the index, for easier
    discovery and search.
  More integration and stanza/stream tests have been added, which gives us
  more confidence on the overall stability.
  The HTTPUpload example has been updated to include an oob reference, because
  many people were reusing the code as-is and wondering why clients were not
  displaying their images inline.
  A lot of work in this release has been to incrementally type the internals of
  slixmpp as well as the public interfaces, to make it easier to validate changes
  and integrate seemlessy with the various IDEs and typecheckers. It is still
  very much a work in progress, in part due to the dynamicity of the API, but
  it should help catch some errors.
  The library now ships with a py.typed file to indicate that it is shipping
  type annotations.
