%description
This package contains type stubs and a custom mypy plugin to provide more precise static types and type inference for
Django framework. Django uses some Python "magic" that makes having precise types for some code patterns problematic.
This is why we need this project. The final goal is to be able to get precise types for most common patterns.

%package ext
Summary:       Extensions and monkey-patching for django-stubs 

%description ext
This package contains extensions and monkey-patching functions for the django-stubs package. Certain features of
django-stubs (i.e. generic django classes that don't define the "__class_getitem__" method) require runtime
monkey-patching, which can't be done with type stubs. These extensions were split into a separate package so library
consumers don't need mypy as a runtime dependency (https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/pull/526).
