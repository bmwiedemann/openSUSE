  <title>Sort lexically, but sort numeral parts numerically</title>
  <description>This module exports two functions, nsort and ncmp; they are used in
implementing my idea of a &quot;natural sorting&quot; algorithm. Under natural
sorting, numeric substrings are compared numerically, and other word-
characters are compared lexically.</description>
