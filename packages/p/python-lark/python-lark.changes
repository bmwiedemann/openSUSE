Fri Jul  3 09:25:30 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.0
  * Added error handling to LALR!
    + on_error option to Lark.parse().
    + Parser now comes with a puppet for advanced error handling.
  * Support for better regexps with the regex module, when using
    Lark(..., regex=True)

- Update to 0.8.9
  * Bugfix for PyInstaller (2) (Fixing the last two releases)

- Update to 0.8.8
  * Reverted EOF commit due to unexpected problems.

- Update to 0.8.7
  * Bugfix for PyInstaller

- Update to 0.8.6
  * Grammar caching: It's now possible to cache the results of the
    LALR grammar analysis, for x2 to x3 faster loading. Use
    Lark(..., cache=True) or specify a file name.
  * Grammar templates: Added support for grammar "functions" that
    expand in preprocessing.
  * Lark online IDE: Technically not a feature, but it's possible to
    run Lark in the browser. Now we also have a simple IDE on github
    pages: https://lark-parser.github.io/lark/ide/app.html
  * Other changes:
    + Improved performance for large grammars
    + More debug prints when in debug mode
    + Better support for PyInstaller
    + Lots of bugfixes: mypy stubs, v_args, docs, and more.

Wed Apr 15 10:54:30 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.5
  * Updated js2py version (for the optional nearley support)
  * Added the g_regex_flags option, to allow applying flags to all terminals.
  * The standalone parser is now MPL2, instead of GPL. The Mozilla 
    Public License is much less restrictive, so this shouldn't affect 
    anyone who's already using the standalone parser. But it should 
    make it easier for other users to adopt it.
  * The biggest change to this release is a new LALR engine, that is 
    capable of dealing with a few edge cases that the previous parser couldn't.
  * Transformers now visit tokens, as well as rules (an alternative to 
    lexer_callbacks)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 27 14:28:26 UTC 2019 - Lars Vogdt <lars@linux-schulserver.de>

- Update to 0.7.7:
  * Fixed a bug in Earley where running it from different threads 
    produced bad results
  * Improved error reporting when using LALR
  * Added 'edit_terminals' option, to allow programmatical manipulation
    of terminals, for example to support keywords in different languages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 13:06:32 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.5:
  * Lark transformers can now visit tokens as wel
  * Fixed long-standing non-determinism and prioritization bugs in Earley.
  * Serialize tool now supports multiple start symbols
  * iter_subtrees, find_data and find_pred methods are now included in standalone parser
  * Bugfixes for the transformer interface, for the custom lexer, for grammar imports, and many more

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 13:28:28 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Drop no longer necessary disable_test.patch
- Replace %doc entry docs/ with docs/* to avoid extra sub-directory
- Added Suggests: python-Js2Py for optional runtime dependency
- Update to v0.7.3
  * Added a new tool called Serialize, that stores Lark's internal
    state as JSON. That will allow for integration with other languages.
  * Minor bugfix regarding line-counting and the \s regex
- from v0.7.2
  * Lark now allows you to specify the start symbol when calling
    Lark.parse() (requires pre-declaration of all possible start states,
    see the start option)
  * Negative priority now allowed in rules and terminals
  * Also includes many minor bugfixes, optimizations, and improvements
    to documentation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 14:06:52 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 0.7.1
    Lark can now serialize its parsers, resulting in simplified stand-alone code.
    Bugfix for v_args (Issue #350)
    Improvements and bugfixes for importing rules from grammar files
    Performance improvement for the reconstructor feature
    New Earley implementation with SPPF support
    Added support for importing rules between grammars. The import mechanism
      is namespace-aware.
    Added the maybe_placeholders option, which causes optionals of the form
     [expr] to return None when not matched, instead of just not appearing.
     (optionals of the form expr? maintain the previous behavior of not
     appearing unless matched)
    Plenty of bugfixes, better errors, and better docs
