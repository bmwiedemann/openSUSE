  <title>Extra sets of Chinese encodings</title>
  <description>Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese encodings,
including the most used CP950, CP936 (also known as GBK), Big5,
Big5-HKSCS, EUC-CN, HZ, and ISO-IR-165.

However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering, and a
complete coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution by
several megabytes; hence, this CPAN module tries to provide the rest of
them.</description>
