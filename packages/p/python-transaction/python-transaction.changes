- Update to version 2.1.2
  * To avoid leaking memory, don’t include unexpected value in
    warnings about non-text transaction meta data.
  2.1.1:
    * For backward compatibility, relax the requirements that
      transaction meta data (user or description) be text:
      + If None is assigned, the assignment is ignored.
      + If a non-text value is assigned, a warning is issued and
        the value is converted to text. If the value is a binary
        string, it will be decoded with the UTF-8 encoding the
        replace error policy.
  2.1.0:
  * Added a transaction-manager explicit mode. Explicit mode makes
    some kinds of application bugs easier to detect and potentially
    allows data managers to manage resources more efficiently.
    (This addresses
    https://github.com/zopefoundation/transaction/issues/35.)
  2.0.3:
  * The user and description fields must now be set with text
    (unicode) data. Previously, if bytes were provided, they’d be
    decoded as ASCII. It was decided that this would lead to bugs
    that were hard to test for.
  * Also, the transaction meta-data field, extended_info has
    been renamed to extension.
  2.0.2:
  * Fixed: Some legacy applications expect the transaction
    _extension attribute to be mutable and it wasn’t.
  2.0.1:
    * The transaction user and description attributes are now
      defined to be text (unicode) as opposed to Python the str
      type.
  * Added the extended_info transaction attribute which contains
    transaction meta data. (The _extension attribute is retained
    as an alias for backward compatibility.)
  * The transaction interface, ITransaction, now requires
    extended_info keys to be text (unicode) and values to be
    JSON-serializable.
  * Removed setUser from ITransaction. We’ll keep the method
    indefinitely, but it’s unseemly in ITransaction. :)
  The main purpose of these changes is to tighten up the text
  specification of user, description and extended_info keys, and
  to give us more flexibility in the future for serializing
  extended info. It’s possible that these changes will be
  breaking, so we’re also increasing the major version number.
  1.7.0:
  * Added a transaction-manager run method for running a
    function as a transaction, retrying as necessary on transient
    errors.
  * Fixed the transaction manager attempts method. It didn’t
    stop repeating when there wasn’t an error.
  * Corrected ITransaction by removing beforeCommitHook (which
    is no longer implemented) and removing ‘self’ from two methods.
  1.6.1:
  * Fixed: Synchonizers that registered with transaction
    managers when transactions were in progress didn’t have their
    newTransaction methods called to let them know of the
    in-progress transactions.
  1.6.0:
  * New transaction API for storing data on behalf of objects,
    such as data managers.
  * Drop references to data managers joined to a transaction
    when it is committed or aborted.
  1.5.0:
  * Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.
  * Add support for Python 3.5.
  * Added APIs for interogating and clearing internal state to
    support client tests.
  1.4.4:
  * Use the standard valuerefs() method rather than relying on
    implementation details of WeakValueDictionary in WeakSet.
  * Add support for PyPy3.
  * Require 100% branch coverage (in addition to 100% statement
    coverage).

- Converted to single-spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 09:56:45 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 1.4.3:
  * Added support for Python 3.4.
  * release 1.4.2 (skipped)
- switch the source archive to tar.gz
- pass -q to the test to avoid spamming the build log

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 18:27:32 UTC 2013 - hpj@urpla.net

- Update to 1.4.1 version:
  * Document that values returned by sortKey must be strings, in order
    to guarantee total ordering.
  * Fix occasional RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
     errors in transaction.weakset on Python 3.

- Generate and install documentation in separate package
- Run tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 15 15:52:04 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Initial python3 support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 15 15:49:33 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 1.4.0 version:
  * Updated Trove classifiers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 15 15:48:03 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to 1.4.0b1 version:
  * Converted existing doctests into Sphinx documentation (snippets
    are exercised via 'tox').
  * 100% unit test coverage.
  * Backward incompatibility: raise ValueError rather than AssertionError
    for runtime errors:
    - In Transaction.doom if the transaction is in a non-doomable state.
    - In TransactionManager.attempts if passed a non-positive value.
    - In TransactionManager.free if passed a foreign transaction.
  * Declared support for Python 3.3 in setup.py, and added tox testing.
  * When a non-retryable exception was raised as the result of a call to
    transaction.manager.commit within the "attempts" machinery, the exception
    was not reraised properly. Symptom: an unrecoverable exception such as
    Unsupported: Storing blobs in <somestorage> is not supported. would be
    swallowed inappropriately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  6 16:07:36 UTC 2012 - os-dev@jacraig.com

- Update to 1.3.0:
  * Added Sphinx API docuementation.
  * Added explicit support for PyPy.
  * Dropped use of Python3-incompatible zope.interface.implements class advisor
    in favor of zope.interface.implementer class decorator.
  * Added support for continuous integration using tox and jenkins.
  * Added setup.py docs alias (installs Sphinx and dependencies).
  * Added setup.py dev alias (runs setup.py develop plus installs nose and
    coverage).
  * Python 3.3 compatibility.
  * Fix "for attempt in transaction.attempts(x)" machinery, which would not
    retry a transaction if its implicit call to .commit() itself raised a
    transient error. Symptom: seeing conflict errors even though you thought
    you were retrying some number of times via the "attempts" machinery (the
    first attempt to generate an exception during commit would cause that
    exception to be raised).

Mon Oct 11 10:00:37 UTC 2010 - coolo@novell.com

- update to 1.1.1
 * Code in ``_transaction.py`` held on to local references to traceback
  objects after calling ``sys.exc_info()`` to get one, causing
  potential reference leakages.
 * Fixed ``hexlify`` NameError in ``transaction._transaction.oid_repr``
  and add test.

Wed Jul 21 12:23:50 UTC 2010 - cfarrell@novell.com

- Updated to 1.1.0
   New Features:
     - Transaction managers and the transaction module can be used with the
       with statement to define transaction boundaries
     - There is a new iterator function that automates dealing with
       transient errors (such as ZODB confict errors).
   Bugs fixed:
     - Fixed a bug that caused extra commit calls to be made on data
       managers under certain special circumstances.
     - When threads were reused, transaction data could leak accross them,
       causing subtle application bugs.
- Fixed zopeinterface require as per bnc#623255 
- Added %doc section
