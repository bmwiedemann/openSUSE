  <title>Find and use installed modules in a (sub)category</title>
  <description>Module::Find lets you find and use modules in categories. This can be very useful for auto-detecting driver or plugin modules. You can differentiate between looking in the category itself or in all subcategories.

If you want Module::Find to search in a certain directory on your harddisk (such as the plugins directory of your software installation), make sure you modify @INC before you call the Module::Find functions.</description>
