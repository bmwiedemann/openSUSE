%description
Module::Find lets you find and use modules in categories. This can be very
useful for auto-detecting driver or plugin modules. You can differentiate
between looking in the category itself or in all subcategories.

If you want Module::Find to search in a certain directory on your harddisk
(such as the plugins directory of your software installation), make sure
you modify '@INC' before you call the Module::Find functions.
