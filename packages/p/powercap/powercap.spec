%description
This project provides the powercap library -- a generic C interface to the
Linux power capping framework (sysfs interface). It includes an implementation
for working with Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL).

It also provides the following applications:

powercap-info - view powercap control type hierarchies or zone/constraint-specific configurations
powercap-set - set powercap control type zone/constraint-specific configurations
