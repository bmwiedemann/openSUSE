Sat Feb 25 18:35:30 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Promote tables-debundled-blosc2.patch to
  tables-pr1000-debundled-blosc2.patch
  * Do not require python-blosc2 for anything
  * gh#PyTables/PyTables#1000
- Remove pre-compiled libblosc2.so gh#PyTables/PyTables#1001
- Split out test into multibuilds: Even the "light" test suite
  takes more than 1 hour for all 4 python flavors executed
  sequentially

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 17 21:15:02 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Use python-blosc2 and c-blosc2
- Drop environement vars which would have only been used with
  embedded c-blosc
- Disable building docs (sphinx update broke it)
- Add tables-debundled-blosc2.patch gh#PyTables/PyTables#1000

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 18:39:24 UTC 2023 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * require python >= 3.8

- update to version 3.8.0:
  * Improvements
    + Support for Python 3.11 has been added (PR #962).
    + Support for Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 has been dropped (PR
      #966).
    + Added a new (registered) HDF5 filter for Blosc2 compressor (PR
      #969).
    + Added optimized paths for Blosc2 reading and writing in
      tables. This bypasses the HDF5 filter pipeline by building the Blosc2 CFrames
      and sending them to the HDF5 direct chunking machinery (PR #969).
    + Internal C-Blosc sources updated to 1.21.2.
    + Thanks to Oscar Guiñon, Francesc Alted for implementing Blosc2
      the support and NumFOCUS for providing a grant for that.
  * Other changes
    + Starting form this release, C source files generated by Cython
      are no longer included in the source distribution package.
    + Pre-built HTML documentation is no longer included in the source
      package.

  * Internal C-Blosc sources updated to 1.21.1 (#931). Note that,
    starting from C-Blosc 1.19 does not include the Snappy codec
    sources anymore, so Snappy will be not available if you compile
    from included sources; other packages (like conda or wheels),
    may (or may not) include it.
  * Switch to git submodule for the management of vendored c-blosc
    sources.
  * Improved code formatting and notation consistency (#873, #868,
    #865 thanks to Miroslav Šedivý).
  * Improve the use of modern Python including :mod:pathlib,
    f-strings (#859, #855, #839 and #818 thanks to Miroslav
    Šedivý).
  * Simplified management of version information.
  * Drop dependency on the deprecated distutils.
  * Modernize the setup script and add support for PEP517 (#907).
  * Fix pkg-config (setup.py) for Python 3.9 on Debian. Thanks to
    Marco Sulla PR #792.
  * Fix ROFileNode fails to return the fileno() (#633).
  * Do not flush read only files (#915 thanks to @lrepiton).
  * Drop the deprecated hdf5Version and File.open_count.
  * the :func:get_tables_version and :func:get_hdf5_version
    functions are now deprecated please use the coresponding
    :data:tables.__version__ and :data:tables.hdf5_version instead.

- %python3_only -> %python_alternative

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  9 15:08:18 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * make it python3 only
  * remove six
  * update required version for numpy and numexpr

- update to version 3.6.1:
  * Maintenance release to fix packaging issues. No new features or
    bugfixes.

- changes from version 3.6.0:
  * PyTables 3.6 no longer supports Python 2.7 see PR #747.
  * Improvements
    + Full python 3.8 support.
    + On Windows PyTables wheels on PyPI are linked to
      `pytables_hdf5.dll` instead of `hdf5.dll` to prevent collisions
      with other packages/wheels that also vendor `hdf5.dll`. This
      should prevent problems that arise when a different version of a
      dll is imported that the version to which the program was linked
      to. This problem is known as "DLL Hell". With the renaming of
      the HDF5 DLL to `pytables_hdf5.dll` these problems should be
      solved.
  * Bugfixes
    + Bugfix for HDF5 files/types with padding. For details see
      :issue:`734`.
    + More fixes for python 3.8 compatibility: Replace deprecated
      time.clock with time.perf_counter Thanks to Sergio Pascual
      (sergiopasra). see :issue:`744` and PR #745.
    + Improvements in tests as well as clean up from dropping Python
      2.7 support.  Thanks to Seth Troisi (sethtroisi).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 16:58:48 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.5.2
  * Fixed compatibility with python 3.8: Fixed `Dictonary keys changed during
    iteration` RuntimeError while moving/renameing a node.
    Thanks to Christoph Gohlke for reporting and Miro Hroncok for help with
    building PyTables for python 3.8alpha (cython compatibility).
  * Fixed a bug in offset calculations producing floats instead of ints
    affecting python 3. See PR #736. Thanks to Brad Montgomery.
- Update to 3.5.1
  * Maintenance release to fix how PyPi repo is handling wheel versions.
- Update to 3.5.0
  * When copying data from native HDF5 files with padding in compound types,
    the padding is not removed now by default.  This allows for better
    compatibility with existing HDF5 applications that expect the padding
    to stay there.
    Also, when the `description` is a NumPy struct array with padding, this
    is honored now.  The previous behaviour (i.e. getting rid of paddings) can
    be replicated by passing the new `allow_padding` parameter when opening
    a file.  For some examples, see the new `examples/tables-with-padding.py`
    and `examples/attrs-with-padding.py`.  For details on the implementation
  * Added a new flag `--dont-allow-padding` in `ptrepack` utility so as to
    replicate the previous behaviour of removing padding during file copies.
    The default is to honor the original padding in copies.
  * Improve compatibility with numpy 1.16.
  * Improve detection of the LZO2 library at build time.
  * Suppress several warnings.
  * Add AVX2 support for Windows.

Wed May  2 10:31:55 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 3.4.3:
  * On interactive python sessions, group/attribute __dir__() method
    autocompletes children that are named as valid python identifiers.
  * Implement Group.__getitem__() to have groups act as python-containers,
    so code like this works: hfile.root['some child'].
  * Enable building with Intel compiler (icc/icpc).
  * PEP 519 support, using new os.fspath method.
  * Optional disable recording of ctime (metadata creation time) when
    creating datasets that makes possible to get bitwise identical output

- update to version 3.2.3:
  * Improvements
    + It is now possible to use HDF5 with the new shared library
      naming scheme (>= 1.8.10, hdf5.dll instead of hdf5dll.dll) on
      Windows (gh-540). Thanks to Tadeu Manoel.
    + Now :program: ptdump sorts output by node name and does not
      print a backtrace if file cannot be opened. Thanks to Zbigniew
      Jędrzejewski-Szmek.
  * Bugs fixed
    + Only run tables.tests.test_basics.UnicodeFilename if the
      filesystem encoding is utf-8. Closes gh-485.
    + Add lib64 to posix search path. (closes gh-507) Thanks to Mehdi
      Sadeghi.
    + Ensure cache entries are removed if fewer than 10 (closes
      gh-529). Thanks to Graham Jones.
    + Fix segmentation fault in a number of test cases that use
      index.Index (closes gh-532 and gh-533). Thanks to Diane Trout.
    + Fixed the evaluation of transcendental functions when numexpr is
      compiled with VML support (closes gh-534, PR #536). Thanks to
      Tom Kooij.
    + Make sure that index classes use buffersizes that are a multiple
      of chunkshape[0] (closes gh-538, PR #538). Thanks to Tom Kooij.
    + Ensure benchmark paths exist before benchmarks are executed (PR
      #544). Thanks to rohitjamuar.

  * Fix issues with Cython 0.23. See gh-481.
  * Only run tables.tests.test_basics.UnicodeFilename if the

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 09:07:43 UTC 2015 - benoit.monin@gmx.fr

- update to version 3.2.0:
  Improvements
  * The nrowsinbuf is better computed now for EArray/CArray having
    a small chunkshape in the main dimension. Fixes #285.
  * PyTables should be installable very friendly via pip, including
    NumPy being installed automatically in the unlikely case it is
    not yet installed in the system. Thanks to Andrea Bedini.
  * setup.py has been largely simplified and now it requires
    setuptools. Although we think this is a good step, please keep
    us informed this is breaking some installation in a very bad
    manner.
  * setup.py now is able to used pkg-config, if available, to
    locate required libraries (hdf5, bzip2, etc.). The use of
    pkg-config can be controlled via setup.py command line flags or
    via environment variables. Please refer to the installation
    guide (in the User Manual) for details. Closes gh-442.
  * It is now possible to create a new node whose parent is a
    softlink to another group (see gh-422). Thanks to Alistair
    Muldal.
  * link.SoftLink objects no longer need to be explicitly
    dereferenced. Methods and attributes of the linked object are
    now automatically accessed when the user acts on a soft-link
    (see gh-399). Thanks to Alistair Muldal.
  * Now ptrepack recognizes hardlinks and replicates them in the
    output (repacked) file. This saves disk space and makes
    repacked files more conformal to the original one. Closes
    gh-380.
  * New pttree script for printing HDF5 file contents as a pretty
    ASCII tree (closes gh-400). Thanks to Alistair Muldal.
  * The internal Blosc library has been downgraded to version
    1.4.4. This is in order to still allow using multiple threads
    inside Blosc, even on multithreaded applications (see gh-411,
    gh-412, gh-437 and gh-448).
  * The print_versions() function now also reports the version of
    compression libraries used by Blosc.
  * Now the setup.py tries to use the ‘-march=native’ C flag by
    default. In falls back on ‘-msse2’ if ‘-march=native’ is not
    supported by the compiler. Closes gh-379.
  * Fixed a spurious unicode comparison warning (closes gh-372 and
    gh-373).
  * Improved handling of empty string attributes. In previous
    versions of PyTables empty string were stored as scalar HDF5
    attributes having size 1 and value ‘0’ (an empty null
    terminated string). Now empty string are stored as HDF5
    attributes having zero size
  * Added a new cookbook recipe and a couple of examples for simple
    threading with PyTables.
  * The redundant utilsextension.get_indices() function has been
    eliminated (replaced by slice.indices()). Closes gh-195.
  * Allow negative indices in point selection (closes gh-360)
  * Index wasn’t being used if it claimed there were no results.
    Closes gh-351 (see also gh-353)
  * Atoms and Col types are no longer generated dynamically so now
    it is easier for IDEs and static analysis tool to handle them
    (closes gh-345)
  * The keysort functions in idx-opt.c have been cythonised using
    fused types. The perfomance is mostly unchanged, but the code
    is much more simpler now. Thanks to Andrea Bedini.
  * Small unit tests re-factoring
  Bugs fixed
  * Fixed compatibility problems with numpy 1.9 and 1.10-dev
    (closes gh-362 and gh-366)
  * Fixed compatibility with Cython >= 0.20 (closes gh-386 and
    gh-387)
  * Fixed support for unicode node names in LRU cache (only Python
    2 was affected). Closes gh-367 and gh-369.
  * Fixed support for unicode node titles (only Python 2 was
    affected). Closes gh-370 and gh-374.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the silent truncation of unicode
    attributes containing the ‘0’ character. Closes gh-371.
  * Fixed descr_from_dtype() to work as expected with complex
    types. Closes gh-381.
  * Fixed the tests.test_basics.ThreadingTestCase test case. Closes
    gh-359.
  * Fix incomplete results when performing the same query twice and
    exhausting the second iterator before the first. The first one
    writes incomplete results to seqcache (gh-353)
  * Fix false results potentially going to seqcache if
    tableextension.Row.update() is used during iteration (see
    gh-353)
  * Fix Column.create_csindex() when there’s NaNs
  * Fixed handling of unicode file names on windows (closes gh-389)
  * No longer not modify sys.argv at import time (closes gh-405)
  * Fixed a performance issue on NFS (closes gh-402)
  * Fixed a nasty problem affecting results of indexed queries.
    Closes gh-319 and probably gh-419 too.
  * Fixed another problem affecting results of indexed queries too.
    Closes gh-441.
  * Replaced “len(xrange(start, stop, step))” -> “len(xrange(0,
    stop - start, step))” to fix issues with large row counts with
    Python 2.x. Fixes #447.
  Other changes
  * Cython is not a hard dependency anymore (although developers
    will need it so as to generated the C extension code).
  * The number of threads used by default for numexpr and Blosc
    operation that was set to the number of available cores have
    been reduced to 2. This is a much more reasonable setting for
    not creating too much overhead.
- add python-setuptools as a new build dependency
- pass -q to %setup to avoid spamming the build log
- rename README.txt to README.rst: changed upstream
- add new binary pttree to the package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  8 11:15:34 UTC 2014 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- New version 3.1.1
  - Fixed a critical bug that caused an exception at import time.
    The error was triggered when a bug in long-double detection is detected
    in the HDF5 library (see :issue:`275`) and numpy_ does not expose
    `float96` or `float128`. Closes :issue:`344`.
  - The internal Blosc_ library has been updated to version 1.3.5.
    This fixes a false buffer overrun condition that made c-blosc to fail,
    even if the problem was not real.
- New version 3.1.0
  - New features¶
    - Now PyTables is able to save/restore the default value 
      of EnumAtom types.
    - Implemented support for the H5FD_SPLIT driver.
    - New quantization filter: the filter truncates floating point 
      data to a specified precision before writing to disk. 
      This can significantly improve the performance of compressors.
    - Added new VLArray.get_row_size() method to VLArray for querying
      the number of atoms of a VLArray row. Closes gh-24 and gh-315.
    - The internal Blosc library has been updated to version 1.3.2. 
      All new features introduced in the Blosc 1.3.x series, and in 
      particular the ability to leverage different compressors within 
      Blosc (see the Blosc Release Notes), are now available in 
      PyTables via the blosc filter.
  - Improvements¶
    - The node caching mechanism has been completely redesigned to 
      be simpler and less dependent from specific behaviours of 
      the __del__ method. Now PyTables is compatible with the 
      forthcoming Python 3.4. Closes gh-306.
    - PyTables no longer uses shared/cached file handlers. 
      This change somewhat improves support for concurrent reading 
      allowing the user to safely open the same file in different 
      threads for reading (requires HDF5 >= 1.8.7). More details 
      about this change can be found in the Backward incompatible 
      changes section. See also gh-130, gh-129 gh-292 and gh-216.
    - PyTables is now able to detect and use external installations 
      of the Blosc library (closes gh-104). If Blosc is not found in 
      the system, and the user do not specify a custom installation 
      directory, then it is used an internal copy of the Blosc source 
      code.
    - Automatically disable extended float support if a buggy version
      of HDF5 is detected (see also Issues with H5T_NATIVE_LDOUBLE).
    - Documented an unexpected behaviour with string literals in query 
      conditions on Python 3 (closes gh-265)
    - The deprecated getopt module has been dropped in favour of 
      argparse in all command line utilities (close gh-251)
    - Improved the installation section of the PyTables User’s Guide.
        - instructions for installing PyTables via pip have been added.
        - added a reference to the Anaconda, Canopy and Christoph 
          Gohlke suites (closes gh-291)
    - Enabled Travis-CI builds for Python 3.3
    - Tables.read_coordinates() now also works with boolean indices input.
    - Improved compatibility with numpy >= 1.8 (see gh-259)
    - The code of the benchmark programs (bench directory) has been updated.
    - Fixed some warning related to non-unicode file names 
      (the Windows bytes API has been deprecated in Python 3.4)
  - Bugs fixed¶
    - Fixed detection of platforms supporting Blosc
    - Fixed a crash that occurred when one attempts to write a numpy array
      to an Atom (closes gh-209 and gh-296)
    - Prevent creation of a table with no columns.
    - Fixed a memory leak that occured when iterating over 
      CArray/EArray objects.
    - Make NaN types sort to the end. Closes gh-282 and gh-313
    - Fixed selection on float columns when NaNs are present.
    - Fix computation of the buffer size for iterations on rows. 
      The buffers size was overestimated resulting in a MemoryError 
      in some cases. Closes gh-316. Thamks to bbudescu.
    - Better check of file open mode. Closes gh-318.
    - The Blosc filter now works correctly together with fletcher32. Closes gh-21.
    - Close the file handle before trying to delete the corresponding file. 
      Fixes a test failure on Windows.
    - Use integer division for computing indices (fixes some warning on Windows)
- Use external python-blosc.  The internal one builds a bad version
  of zlib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Since this release PyTables provides full support to Python_ 3
      (closes :issue:`188`).
    - The entire code base is now more compliant with coding style guidelines
      describe in the PEP8_ (closes :issue:`103` and :issue:`224`).
      See `API changes`_ for more details.
    - Basic support for HDF5 drivers.  Now it is possible to open/create an
      HDF5 file using one of the SEC2, DIRECT, LOG, WINDOWS, STDIO or CORE
      drivers.  Users can also set the main driver parameters (closes
      :issue:`166`).
      Thanks to Michal Slonina.
    - Basic support for in-memory image files.  An HDF5 file can be set from or
      copied into a memory buffer (thanks to Michal Slonina).  This feature is
      only available if PyTables is built against HDF5 1.8.9 or newer.
      Closes :issue:`165` and :issue:`173`.
    - New :meth:`File.get_filesize` method for retrieving the HDF5 file size.
    - Implemented methods to get/set the user block size in a HDF5 file
      (closes :issue:`123`)
    - Improved support for PyInstaller_.  Now it is easier to pack frozen
      applications that use the PyTables package (closes: :issue:`177`).
      Thanks to Stuart Mentzer and Christoph Gohlke.
    - All read methods now have an optional *out* argument that allows to pass a
      pre-allocated array to store data (closes :issue:`192`)
    - Added support for the floating point data types with extended precision
      (Float96, Float128, Complex192 and Complex256).  This feature is only
      available if numpy_ provides it as well.
      Closes :issue:`51` and :issue:`214`.  Many thanks to Andrea Bedini.
    - Consistent ``create_xxx()`` signatures.  Now it is possible to create all
      data sets :class:`Array`, :class:`CArray`, :class:`EArray`,
      :class:`VLArray`, and :class:`Table` from existing Python objects (closes
      :issue:`61` and :issue:`249`).  See also the `API changes`_ section.
    - Complete rewrite of the :mod:`nodes.filenode` module. Now it is fully
      compliant with the interfaces defined in the standard :mod:`io` module.
      Only non-buffered binary I/O is supported currently.
      See also the `API changes`_ section.  Closes :issue:`244`.
    - New :program:`pt2to3` tool is provided to help users to port their
      applications to the new API (see `API changes`_ section).
  * Improvements
    - Improved runtime checks on dynamic loading of libraries: meaningful error
      messages are generated in case of failure.
      Also, now PyTables no more alters the system PATH.
      Closes :issue:`178` and :issue:`179` (thanks to Christoph Gohlke).
    - Improved list of search paths for libraries as suggested by Nicholaus
      Halecky (see :issue:`219`).
    - Removed deprecated Cython_ include (.pxi) files. Contents of
      :file:`convtypetables.pxi` have been moved in :file:`utilsextension.pyx`.
      Closes :issue:`217`.
    - The internal Blosc_ library has been upgraded to version 1.2.3.
    - Pre-load the bzip2_ library on windows (closes :issue:`205`)
    - The :meth:`File.get_node` method now accepts unicode paths
      (closes :issue:`203`)
    - Improved compatibility with Cython_ 0.19 (see :issue:`220` and
      :issue:`221`)
    - Improved compatibility with numexpr_ 2.1 (see also :issue:`199` and
      :issue:`241`)
    - Improved compatibility with development versions of numpy_
      (see :issue:`193`)
    - Packaging: since this release the standard tar-ball package no more includes
      the PDF version of the "PyTables User Guide", so it is a little bit smaller
      now.  The complete and pre-build version of the documentation both in HTML
      and PDF format is available on the file `download area`_ on SourceForge.net.
      Closes: :issue:`172`.
    - Now PyTables also uses `Travis-CI`_ as continuous integration service.
      All branches and all pull requests are automatically tested with different
      Python_ versions.  Closes :issue:`212`.
  * Other changes
    - PyTables now requires Python 2.6 or newer.
    - Minimum supported version of Numexpr_ is now 2.0.
  * API changes
    The entire PyTables API as been made more PEP8_ compliant (see :issue:`224`).

    This means that many methods, attributes, module global variables and also
    keyword parameters have been renamed to be compliant with PEP8_ style
    guidelines (e.g. the ``tables.hdf5Version`` constant has been renamed into
    ``tables.hdf5_version``).

    We made the best effort to maintain compatibility to the old API for existing
    applications.  In most cases, the old 2.x API is still available and usable
    even if it is now deprecated (see the Deprecations_ section).

    The only important backwards incompatible API changes are for names of
    function/methods arguments.  All uses of keyword arguments should be
    checked and fixed to use the new naming convention.

    The new :program:`pt2to3` tool can be used to port PyTables based applications
    to the new API.

    Many deprecated features and support for obsolete modules has been dropped:
    - The deprecated :data:`is_pro` module constant has been removed
    - The nra module and support for the obsolete numarray module has been removed.
      The *numarray* flavor is no more supported as well (closes :issue:`107`).
    - Support for the obsolete Numeric module has been removed.
      The *numeric* flavor is no longer available (closes :issue:`108`).
    - The tables.netcdf3 module has been removed (closes :issue:`68`).
    - The deprecated :exc:`exceptions.Incompat16Warning` exception has been
      removed
    - The :meth:`File.create_external_link` method no longer has a keyword
      parameter named *warn16incompat*.  It was deprecated in PyTables 2.4.
    - The :meth:`File.create_array`, :meth:`File.create_carray`,
      :meth:`File.create_earray`, :meth:`File.create_vlarray`, and
      :meth:`File.create_table` methods of the :class:`File` objects gained a
      new (optional) keyword argument named ``obj``.  It can be used to initialize
      the newly created dataset with an existing Python object, though normally
      these are numpy_ arrays.
      The *atom*/*descriptor* and *shape* parameters are now optional if the
      *obj* argument is provided.
    - The :mod:`nodes.filenode` has been completely rewritten to be fully
      compliant with the interfaces defined in the :mod:`io` module.
      The FileNode classes currently implemented are intended for binary I/O.
      Main changes:
      * the FileNode base class is no more available,
      * the new version of :class:`nodes.filenode.ROFileNode` and
        :class:`nodes.filenode.RAFileNode` objects no more expose the *offset*
        attribute (the *seek* and *tell* methods can be used instead),
      * the *lineSeparator* property is no more available end the ``\n``
        character is always used as line separator.
    - The `__version__` module constants has been removed from almost all the
      modules (it was not used after the switch to Git).  Of course the package
      level constant (:data:`tables.__version__`) still remains.
      Closes :issue:`112`.
    - The :func:`lrange` has been dropped in favor of xrange (:issue:`181`)
    - The :data:`parameters.MAX_THREADS` configuration parameter has been dropped
      in favor of :data:`parameters.MAX_BLOSC_THREADS` and
      :data:`parameters.MAX_NUMEXPR_THREADS` (closes :issue:`147`).
    - The :func:`conditions.compile_condition` function no more has a *copycols*
      argument, it was no more necessary since Numexpr_ 1.3.1.
      Closes :issue:`117`.
    - The *expectedsizeinMB* parameter of the :meth:`File.create_vlarray` and of
      the :meth:`VLArrsy.__init__` methods has been replaced by *expectedrows*.
      See also (:issue:`35`).
    - The :meth:`Table.whereAppend` method has been renamed into
      :meth:`Table.append_where` (closes :issue:`248`).
  * Other possibly incompatible changes
    - All methods of the :class:`Table` class that take *start*, *stop* and
      *step* parameters (including :meth:`Table.read`, :meth:`Table.where`,
      :meth:`Table.iterrows`, etc) have been redesigned to have a consistent
      behaviour.  The meaning of the *start*, *stop* and *step* and their default
      values now always work exactly like in the standard :class:`slice` objects.
      Closes :issue:`44` and :issue:`255`.
    - Unicode attributes are not stored in the HDF5 file as pickled string.
      They are now saved on the HDF5 file as UTF-8 encoded strings.
    - System attributes are now stored in the HDF5 file using the character set
      that reflects the native string behaviour: ASCII for Python 2 and UTF8 for
      Python 3.  In any case, system attributes are represented as Python string.
    - The :meth:`iterrows` method of :class:`*Array` and :class:`Table` as well
      as the :meth:`Table.itersorted` now behave like functions in the standard
      :mod:`itertools` module.
      If the *start* parameter is provided and *stop* is None then the
      array/table is iterated from *start* to the last line.
      In PyTables < 3.0 only one element was returned.
  * Deprecations
    - As described in `API changes`_, all functions, methods and attribute names
      that was not compliant with the PEP8_ guidelines have been changed.
      Old names are still available but they are deprecated.
    - The use of upper-case keyword arguments in the :func:`open_file` function
      and the :class:`File` class initializer is now deprecated.  All parameters
      defined in the :file:`tables/parameters.py` module can still be passed as
      keyword argument to the :func:`open_file` function just using a lower-case
      version of the parameter name.
