Wed Feb 27 02:30:05 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Remove build dependency on pytest-flake8 and pytest-sugar, dropping
  fix-lint.patch which is now unnecessary modification.
- Remove doc dependencies as the docs are not being built, and have limited
  value beyond information not already present in the rst files.
- Remove redundant build dependency on python-jaraco.base, which is a
  dependency of the other listed 'real' jaraco dependencies.
- Remove build dependency on python-six
- Add runtime dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Aug 23 08:48:15 UTC 2018 - dheidler@suse.de

- Update to version 16.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 14 19:42:26 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 16.0
  * Removed deprecated ``execute_*`` methods on ``Connection``
    and ``Reactor`` as introduced in 15.0.
  * Fixed link in README.
  15.1.1:
  * New ``send_items`` method takes star args for simplicity
    in the syntax and usage.
  15.1:
  * Introduce ``ServerConnection.send_items``, consolidating
    common behavior across many methods previously calling
    ``send_raw``.
  15.0.6:
  * Now publish `documentation
    <https://python-irc.readthedocs.io/>`_ to Read The Docs.
  15.0.5:
  * #119: Handle broken pipe exception in IRCClient _send()
    (server.py).
  15.0.4:
  * #116: Correct invocation of execute_every.
  15.0.3:
  * #115: Fix AttributeError in ``execute_at`` in scheduling
    support.
  15.0.2:
  * #113: Use preferred scheduler in the bot implementation.
  15.0.1:
  * Deprecated calls to Connection.execute_* and
    Reactor.execute_*. Instead, call the equivalently-named
    methods on the reactor's scheduler.
  15.0:
  * The event scheduling functionality has been decoupled
    from the client.Reactor object. Now the reactor will
    construct a Scheduler from the scheduler_class property,
    which must be an instance of irc.schedule.IScheduler.
    The ``_on_schedule`` parameter is no longer accepted
    to the Reactor class. Implementations requiring a
    signal during scheduling should hook into the ``add``
    method of the relevant scheduler class.
  * Moved the underlying scheduler implementation to
    `tempora <https://pypi.org/project/tempora>`_, allowing
    it to be re-used for other purposes.

- Added -doc subpackage

- Converted to single-spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 30 18:24:12 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 14.2.2 (changes since 8.5.4):
  * Drop support for Python 2.6.
  * Drop support for Python 3.2.
  * Introduce ‘Manifold’ as an alias for irc.client.IRC. This
    better name will replace the IRC name in a future version.
  * Introduce the ‘manifold’ property of SimpleIRCClient as an
    alias for ircobj.
  * Add ‘manifold_class’ property to the client.SimpleIRCClient to
    allow consumers to provide a customised Manifold.
  * Introduce buffer.LenientDecodingLineBuffer for handling input
    in a more lenient way, preferring UTF-8 but falling back to
    latin-1 if the content cannot be decoded as UTF-8. To enable it
    by default for your application, set it as the default decoder.
  * Remove the mutex during process_once.
  * Deprecated buffer.LineBuffer for Python 3.
  * The whois command now accepts a single string or iterable for
    the target.
  * NickMask now returns None when user, host, or userhost are not
    present. Previously, an IndexError was raised.
  * Drop irc.client.LineBuffer and irc.client.DecodingBuffer
    (available in irc.client.buffer).
  * Rename irc.client.IRC to irc.client.Manifold to provide a
    clearer name for that object. Clients supporting 8.6 and later
    can use the Manifold name. Latest clients must use the Manifold
    name.
  * Rename irc.client.Connection.irclibobj property to manifold.
    The property is still exposed as irclibobj for compatibility
    but will be removed in a future version.
  * Remove unused irc.client.mask_matches function.
  * Remove unused irc.client.nick_characters.
  * Add extra numerics for ‘whoisaccount’ and ‘cannotknock’.
  * Add ServerConnection.as_nick, a context manager to set a nick
    for the duration of the context.
  * Rename irc.client.Manifold to irc.client.Reactor. Reactor
    better reflects the implementation as a reactor pattern <. This
    name makes it’s function much more clear and inline with
    standard terminology.
  * Remove deprecated manifold and irclibobj properties from
    Connection. Use reactor instead.
  * Remove deprecated ircobj from SimpleIRCClient. Use reactor
    instead.
  * Decoding errors now log a warning giving a reference to the
    Decoding Input section of the readme.
  * Remove dependency on jaraco.util. Instead depend on surgical
    packages.
  * Deprecate irc.logging in favour of jaraco.logging.
  * Remove changelog from package metadata.
  * Better handling of Python 3 in testbot.py script.
  * Fix broken references to irc.client members.
  * Add numeric for WHOX reply.
  * Add support for tags in message processing and Event class.
  * Fix apparent escaping issue with IRCv3 tags.
  * Move Throttler class to jaraco.functools 1.5.
  * Update schedule module to properly support timezone aware times
    and use them by default. Clients that rely on the timezone
    native datetimes may restore the old behaviour by overriding
    the schedule.now and schedule.from_timestamp functions.
  * Clients that were previously patching
    schedule.DelayedCommand.now will need to instead patch the
    aforementioned module-global methods. The classmethod technique
    was a poor interface for effectively controlling timezone
    awareness, so was likely unused.
  * ISUPPORT PREFIX now retains the order of permissions for each
    prefix.
  * Fix infinite recursion for irc.strings.IRCFoldedCase and
    irc.strings.lower.
  * In irc.bot, add support for tracking admin status (mode ‘a’) in
    channels. Use channel.is_admin or channel.admins to identify
    admin users for a channel.
  * Remove deprecated irc.logging module.
  * Now remove mode for owners, halfops, and admins when the user is
    removed from a channel.
  * Refactor the Channel class implementation for cleaner, less
    repetitive code.
  * Expand tests coverage for Channel class.
  * Dropped deprecated constructor
    connection.Factory.from_legacy_params. Use the natural
    constructor instead.
  * connection.Factory no longer attempts to bind before connect
    unless a bind address is specified.
  * SingleServerIRCBot now accepts a recon parameter implementing a
    ReconnectStrategy. The new default strategy is
    ExponentialBackoff, implementing an exponential backoff with
    jitter. The reconnection_interval parameter is now deprecated
    but retained for compatibility. To customise the minimum time
    before reconnect, create a custom ExponentialBackoff instance
    or create another ReconnectStrategy object and pass that as the
    recon parameter. The reconnection_interval parameter will be
    removed in future versions.
  * The ExponentialBackoff implementation now protects from
    multiple scheduled reconnects, avoiding the issue where
    reconnect attempts accumulate exponentially when the bot is
    immediately disconnected by the server.
  * Move buffer module to jaraco.stream for use in other packages.
  * Update docs to remove missing or deprecated modules.
  * Declare Gitter support as a badge in the docs.
  * Add an ugly hack to force build_sphinx command to have the
    requisite libraries to build module documentation.
- Correct licence: MIT.
- Remove python-irclib obsoletion: different non-conflicting
  package.
