  <title>Create generic methods for OO Perl</title>
  <description>This module solves the problem of having to continually write accessor
methods for your objects that perform standard tasks.

The argument to 'use' is an *arrayref*, as pairs whose &quot;keys&quot; are the names
of types of generic methods generated by MethodMaker and whose &quot;values&quot;
tell method maker what methods to make.

To override any generated methods, it is sufficient to ensure that the
overriding method is defined when Class::MethodMaker is called. Note that
the 'use' keyword introduces a 'BEGIN' block, so you may need to define (or
at least declare) your overriding method in a 'BEGIN' block.</description>
