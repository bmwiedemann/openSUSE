- Drop python2 support
- Remove py34-no-singledispatch.patch
- Replace brotlipy dependency with Brotli
- Remove dependancies that are not needed to build.
- Update to v0.8.0
  * Changes
    + Dropped Python 2 support. If you need it, use the older versions.
    + HTTPolice no longer requires six nor singledispatch.
    + HTTPolice now pulls in Google's Brotli instead of brotlipy,
      but this is merely a packaging change; it can work with either.
    + Notices 1299 and 1300 are no longer reported on Alt-Svc.

- Fix Python 3 tests
- Add py34-no-singledispatch.patch to remove unnecessary 'singledispatch'
  dependency, which is a backport from Python 3.4
- Update to v0.7.0
  * Changes
    + Reflecting changes in RFC 8187 and RFC 8259,
      notices 1253 (bad charset) and 1281 (bad encoding for JSON)
      are now reported for all encodings other than UTF-8, and
      notice 1255 (ISO-8859-1 in Content-Disposition) has been removed.
  * Added
    + Checks for quoted commas and semicolons that might confuse a naive parser
      (notices 1299 and 1300).
    + New checks for Link headers according to RFC 8288 (notices 1307,
      1308, and 1309).
    + Checks for immutable responses (notices 1301, 1302, and 1303).
    + Early hints are now recognized (due to their idiosyncratic semantics,
      they avoid many checks that are applied to all other responses).
    + Checks for the Accept-Post header (notice 1310).
    + Check for no Transfer-Encoding in response to HTTP/1.0 (notice 1306).
    + Check for 100 (Continue) before switching protocols (notice 1305).
    + Check that the sequence of responses to a request makes sense
      (notice 1304).
    + HAR files exported from Chrome and Insomnia are handled slightly better.
  * Fixed
    + Headers like Allow and Accept are now parsed more correctly
      (RFC Errata 5257).
    + gzip-encoded payloads are now decompressed more reliably.
    + When analyzing TCP streams, HTTPolice now uses a stricter heuristic
      for detecting HTTP/1.x streams, producing fewer spurious 1006/1009
      notices.
    + Notice 1291 (Preference-Applied needs Vary) is no longer reported
      on responses to POST.
