%description
Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is a Mojolicious plugin for processing
static assets. The idea is that JavaScript and CSS files should be served
as one minified file to save bandwidth and roundtrip time to the server.

There are many external tools for doing this, but integrating them with
Mojolicious can be a struggle: You want to serve the source files directly
while developing, but a minified version in production. This assetpack
plugin will handle all of that automatically for you.

Your application creates and refers to an asset by its topic (virtual asset
name). The process of building actual assets from their components is
delegated to "pipe objects".
