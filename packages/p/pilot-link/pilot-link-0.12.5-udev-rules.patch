Subject: [PATCH] Fix libpisock udev rule

udev goes on with rules evaluation as long as tests succeed. Thus
"A!=x, B!=y, goto end" will only jump to end if A!=x AND B!=y. In other
words the jump is skipped (and thus the following rules are processed)
if A==x OR B==y. This is clearly not the intent here, as we only want
to act on USB devices being added.

Additionally, we can check SUBSYSTEM instead of SUBSYSTEMS, it is
slightly faster. As far as I know only USB devices have the idVendor
and idProduct attributes so it makes no sense to check for these if we
aren't a USB device ourselves.
