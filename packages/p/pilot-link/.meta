  <title>Pilot-Link Based Synchronization Development Header Files</title>
  <description>pilot-link is a suite of tools used to connect your Palm or PalmOS compatible
handheld with Unix, Linux, and any other POSIX-compatible machine. pilot-link
works with all PalmOS handhelds, including those made by Handspring, Sony,
and Palm, as well as others.

pilot-link includes userspace &quot;conduits&quot; that allow you to synchronize
information to and from your Palm device, as well as libraries of
Palm-compatible functions that allow other applications to take advantage of
the code included in pilot-link.

There are also several language &quot;bindings&quot; that allow you to use your favorite
development language with pilot-link, such as Java, Tcl, Perl, and Python.</description>
