%description
Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture almost anything
sent to STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl, from XS
code or from an external program. Optionally, output can be teed so that it
is captured while being passed through to the original filehandles. Yes, it
even works on Windows (usually). Stop guessing which of a dozen capturing
modules to use in any particular situation and just use this one.
