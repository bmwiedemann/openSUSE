          + Fix : [RT #129539] : fails with v5.27.3 and later with DEBUGGING
                  The module has been amended to accomodate with a change of
                  behaviour of a core macro.
          + Upd : Contact info.

                  localize '$Foo::x' => $var now properly imports $x into Foo.

          + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                  other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                  to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
          + Fix : [RT #112246] : Blead breaks Scope::Upper
                  Dave Mitchell provided a new implementation of reap(),
                  localize_*() and uplevel() to match the new context stack
                  handling in perl 5.24. Many thanks to him.

          + Chg : SUB() and EVAL() will now warn if they cannot find an
                  appropriate context in the current stack. They will still
                  return undef in this case, which is interpreted as the current
                  context when combined with other words.
          + Fix : [RT #104751] : Scope::Upper does not handle exotic stack types
                  Trying to target a scope above the current perl scope will now
                  result in a warning. In that case, the topmost context in the
                  current stack will still be returned.
                  Thanks Rafaël Garcia-Suarez for the report.
          + Fix : Test failures of threads tests on systems with harsh resource
                  constraints causing the threads to exit() during run.
          + Opt : Some internal structures were shrunk, resulting in memory
                  savings and small speedups.

  0.27    2015-03-27 22:10 UTC
          + Chg : The new environment variable to enable thread tests on older
                  perls is PERL_FORCE_TEST_THREADS. Note that this variable
                  should only be turned on by authors.
          + Fix : Segfaults when the module is loaded by several threads (or
                  Windows emulated processes) ran in parallel.
          + Fix : Memory leak with the uid() feature.
          + Fix : Update the Windows ActivePerl + gcc 3.4 workaround for
                  ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.04. Thanks Christian Walde for reporting
                  and feedback on this issue.
          + Fix : reap(), localize(), localize_elem() and localize_delete()
                  will again work correctly on perl 5.19.4+ when the debugger
                  is enabled.
          + Fix : Silence some compiler warnings.
  
  0.26    2015-03-12 23:30 UTC
          + Fix : [RT #100264] : Don't use CvPADLIST on XSUBs
                  Thanks Father Chrysostomos for reporting and contributing a
                  patch.
          + Fix : Be really compatible with the optional OP_PARENT feature.
  
  0.25    2014-09-21 17:10 UTC
          + Add : Support for the PERL_OP_PARENT optional feature introduced in
                  perl 5.21.2.
          + Fix : Work around an assertion failure in perl 5.21.4.

- updated to 0.24
         + Fix : Lexicals returned with unwind(), yield() and leave() will no
                 longer be lost on perl 5.19.4 and above.
         This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
         Satisfied users of version 0.22 can skip this update.
         + Fix : [RT #87178] : typo fixes.
                 Thanks dsteinbrunner@pobox.com for the patch.
         + Fix : [RT #88177] : 5.19.3 block hint test breakage
                 t/07-context_info.t has been taught about perl 5.19.3.
                 Thanks Andrew Main for the patch.
         + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                 They are only made available to authors in the git repository.
         + Tst : "given is experimental" warnings when running tests on perl
                 5.18 and above have been silenced.

- updated to 0.22
       + Chg : perl 5.6.1 is required.
       + Fix : context_info() now ignores %warnings::Bits for perl 5.8.6 and
               below, just like caller().
       + Fix : [RT #82220] : Scope-Upper-0.21 test stuck on Windows perl 5.12.3
               t/93-pod-spelling.t will not crash anymore on perl 5.12 and
               below.
               Thanks Gabor Szabo for reporting and Slaven Rezic for debugging
               this issue.
       + Tst : Rare test failures of t/07-context_info.t on perl 5.6,
               t/55-yield-target.t on perl 5.[68], and t/63-uplevel-ctl.t on
               perl 5.8.[345] have been addressed.

       + Fix : context_info() has been taught about perl 5.17.4.
       + Fix : t/07-context_info.t will no longer fail with perls that have
               sitecustomize enabled (like many perl builds for Windows).
               Thanks Steve Hay and Nicholas Clark for debugging help.
       + Fix : Broken linkage on Windows with gcc 3.4, which appears in
               particular when using ActivePerl's default compiler suite.
               For those setups, the Scope::Upper shared library will now be
               linked against the perl dll directly (instead of the import
               library).

       + Add : The new yield(@values, $context) function can be used to return
               values to any upper scope, including do or map blocks.
               The new leave(@values) function is an alias for
               yield(@values, HERE).
       + Add : The new context_info($context) function return information
               about context $context, similarly to what caller() provides
               but for any upper scope.
       + Chg : Contexts are now normalized. In previous versions, it was
               possible for different contexts to refer to the same scope :
               for example, "for (my $i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) { ... }" was
               reachable through two contexts, while "for (@array) { ... }"
               only by one. Starting from this version, contexts are
               normalized so that they always represent an actual scope.
       + Doc : C++ compilers are officially NOT supported.
       + Fix : Building with a more recent version of perl 5.17.4.
       + Fix : Debugger compatibility with perl 5.17.1 and above.

       + Doc : POD headings have been made linkable.
       + Fix : Building with perl 5.17.4.
       + Fix : BUILD_PREREQS are now set for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
       + Opt : uplevel() private data structure is 7% smaller on 64 bits
               architectures.
       + Tst : Author tests overhaul.

- update to 0.18
     + Add : The uid() function returns an unique identifier for each dynamic
             scope. The validate_uid() function can be used to check whether
             one such identifier is valid (i.e. that the scope it refers to
             is still alive).
     + Chg : It is no longer possible on perl 5.6 to call goto() in an
             uplevel callback to replace the uplevel call. This change was
             needed in order to ensure consistency between platforms
             regarding to the following fix just below.
     + Fix : The uplevel() tests now pass on Windows.
             Thanks C.H. Kang for bringing this to my attention.

- updated to 0.14
       + Fix : [RT #64997] : Compatibility with perl 5.13.10.
               Thanks Dave Mitchell for the notice.
       + Tst : Lengthy tests have been ported to Test::Leaner, making the
               whole test suite about 50% faster.
  
       + Fix : [RT #61904] : Stack corruption when using unwind() under
               Devel::NYTProf.
               Thanks Sergey Aleynikov for contributing a fix.
       + Fix : [RT #63378] : Compatibility with perl 5.13.8.
               Thanks Andreas J. König for bisecting the issue.
       + Tst : Threads tests are now only run on perl 5.13.4 and higher.
               They could segfault randomly because of what seems to be an
               internal bug of Perl, which has been addressed in 5.13.4.
               There is also an environment variable that allows you to
               forcefully run those tests, but it should be set only for
               author testing and not for end users.
