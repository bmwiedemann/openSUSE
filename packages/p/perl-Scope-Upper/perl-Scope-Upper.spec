%description
This module lets you defer actions _at run-time_ that will take place when
the control flow returns into an upper scope. Currently, you can:

  * hook an upper scope end with reap ;

  * localize variables, array/hash values or deletions of elements in higher
contexts with respectively localize, localize_elem and localize_delete ;

  * return values immediately to an upper level with unwind, yield and leave ;

  * gather information about an upper context with want_at and context_info ;

  * execute a subroutine in the setting of an upper subroutine stack frame with
uplevel ;

  * uniquely identify contexts with uid and validate_uid.
