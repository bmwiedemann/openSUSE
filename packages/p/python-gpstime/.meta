  <title>GPS-aware Python datetime module</title>
  <description>This package provides GPS time conversion utilities, including a
gpstime subclass of the built-in datetime class with the addition of
GPS time parsing and conversion methods.

It also provides a command-line GPS conversion utility that uses the
gpstime module, a rough work-alike to LIGO &quot;tconvert&quot; utility.
