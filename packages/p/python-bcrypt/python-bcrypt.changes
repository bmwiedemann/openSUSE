- update to 4.1.3:
  * Bump Rust dependency versions
  * Fixed the type signature on the ``kdf`` method.
  * Fixed packaging bug on Windows.
  * Fixed incompatibility with passlib package detection assumptions.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.6.
  * Bumped MSRV to 1.64. (Note: Rust 1.63 can be used by setting the
    ``BCRYPT_ALLOW_RUST_163`` environment variable)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:22:33 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:40:13 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 06:44:04 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Removed not needed C build dependencies
- Enable for all archs by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 16:32:00 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.1:
  * We now build PyPy manylinux wheels.
  * Fixed a bug where passing an invalid salt to checkpw could result in a
    pyo3_runtime.PanicException. It now correctly raises a ValueError.
- 4.0.0:
  * bcrypt is now implemented in Rust. Users building from source will need to
    have a Rust compiler available. Nothing will change for users downloading
    wheels.
  * We no longer ship manylinux2010 wheels. Users should upgrade to the latest
    pip to ensure this doesn’t cause issues downloading wheels on their
    platform. We now ship manylinux_2_28 wheels for users on new enough
    platforms.
  * NUL bytes are now allowed in inputs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 15:43:50 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Remove not needed python-six dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 19:20:18 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.2.2:
  * Fixed packaging of ``py.typed`` files in wheels so that ``mypy`` works.
  * Added support for compilation on z/OS
  * The next release of ``bcrypt`` with be 4.0 and it will require Rust at
    compile time, for users building from source. There will be no additional
    requirement for users who are installing from wheels. Users on most
    platforms will be able to obtain a wheel by making sure they have an up to
    date ``pip``. The minimum supported Rust version will be 1.56.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 10:13:31 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Don't use deprecated 'python setup.py test', use pytest directly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 11:20:23 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Relax the setuptools dependency on 40.8.0 to 40.5.0 since that
  version is only required by upstream because of a pip issue
  (see https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/commit/bc8a55e70e179a59fa89fb109353182f8f438e00).
  This way we can build in SLE 15 SP2 / Leap 15.2 .

  * Added support for compilation on Haiku.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 11:19:33 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>
