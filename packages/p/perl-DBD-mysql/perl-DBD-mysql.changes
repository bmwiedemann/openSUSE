  YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE, THIS IS A REVERT TO 4.041
  This version is the same as 4.041 with all its bugs and
  limitations. In version 4.042 there were some changes to Unicode handling
  that turned out to be causing issues with existing implementations.
  While it is possible to argue that the old behaviour was wrong and buggy,
  lots of applications and scripts were depending on this behaviour so it
  is NOT a good idea to change this.
  
  There were lots of commits since 4.041, we'll add those back bit by bit
  in a future release, excluding the ones which cause problems.

  2016-11-28 Patrick Galbraith, Michiel Beijen, DBI/DBD community (4.041)
  * Fix use-after-free for repeated fetchrow_arrayref calls when
    mysql_server_prepare=1
  
    Function dbd_st_fetch() via Renew() can reallocate output buffer for
    mysql_stmt_fetch() call. But it does not update pointer to that buffer in
    imp_sth->stmt structure initialized by mysql_stmt_bind_result() function.
    That leads to use-after-free in any mysql function which access
    imp_sth->stmt structure (e.g. mysql_stmt_fetch()).
  
    This patch fix this problem and properly updates pointer in imp_sth->stmt
    structure after Renew() call.
    This is a medium level security issue to which the Debian security team
    assigned identifier CVE-2016-1251. Discovered and fixed by Pali Rohár.
  
  * auto_reconnect now also matches  CR_SERVER_LOST, previously this only
    matched CR_SERVER_GONE.
    Fixes http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27613
    Fix suggested by Wouter de Jong.
  * Fix compilation fixes (Pali Rohár).

  * Since 4.038 we had problems compiling on big-endian architectures, such
    as MIPS, s390 and Sparc. Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso @ Debian project
    (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=844538)
    and Vladimir Marek (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=118835)
    for reporting the issues. Fix by Pali Rohár.
  
    Fix integer types when server side prepare statements are enabled
    Fixed problems:
    * SQL_BIGINT was incorrectly handled as 32bit MYSQL_TYPE_LONG type instead
      64bit MYSQL_TYPE_LONGLONG which led to integer overflow/underflow
    * 32bit MYSQL_TYPE_LONG was used for perl's IV storage when IV was 64bit
      and 64bit MYSQL_TYPE_LONGLONG was used when IV was 32bit
    * All unsigned types were handled as signed, so all high positive values
      were treated as negative
    * Numeric conversions in perl which led to overflow/underflow was ignored
      even when mysql strict mode was enabled
    * Test t/41int_min_max.t was running only for normal non-prepared statements
    * Test t/40server_prepare.t used incorrect SQL type for big (64bit) integers

  * Fixes for compiling against newer libmysqlclient on Windows (kmx)
  * Fix unit test for 40server_prepare_crash on Windows (pali)
  * Perl's IV in scalar can store 64bit integer when perl was compiled
    with 64 bit support (default on 64bit linux with gcc). Use this
    feature and stores MYSQL_TYPE_LONGLONG as integers instead of strings
    when possible. (pali, https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/pull/57)
  
  2016-10-14 Patrick Galbraith, Michiel Beijen, DBI/DBD community (4.037_01)
  * Newest versions of libmysqlclient and the MariaDB C connector no longer
    export the __WIN__ macro. If this macro is not present we would not
    compile in the poll.h-based async-support. Changed to use the _WIN32
    macro instead. Thanks to Sergei Golubchik for suggesting the fix.

    did not compile in SSL support.

    not yet created, we would not correctly create the test database.

  * Test 56connattr.t failed when run when performance schema is enabled, but
    tests were run as a user with limited permissions.
    Reported by Jérôme Étévé.
    (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=115980)
  * In 4.033_03 we added a patch from Petr Písař @ Red Hat for a problem on
    64-bit big-endian systems. The patch was applied but the unit test was not,
    also, there was no entry in the change log.
    Unit test provided by Vladimir Marek.
    t/40server_prepare.t test failed on s390x platform. Server-prepared
    values of types int, smallint, and tinyint are passed to application
    as 32-bit integer. The same buffer was interpreted as long integer
    by DBD::MySQL. This caused misaligned read/write and bogus
    interpretation of the values.
     (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57266)
  * Remove dropdb, createdb, reload and shutdown admin functions from perldoc.
    These are deprecated by the C API.
    Use 'CREATE DATABASE..', 'DROP DATABASE...' and other SQL commands instead.
  * Test rt75353-innodb-lock-timeout.t fails on MySQL Server 5.1 and earlier
    because innodb_lock_wait_timeout is not modifyable per session.
  * Test rt25389-bin-case.t does not work on MySQL Server < 5.1, reported by
    GAAS.
  
  2016-08-01 Patrick Galbraith, Michiel Beijen, DBI/DBD community (4.035_01)
  * Apparently, on t/31insertid.t, there is one test that fails when compiled
    against libmysqlclient 5.7 or up; issuing a SELECT statement on the same
    database handle that previously executed an INSERT clears
    $dbh->{mysql_insertid}, while previously this was retained.
    (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108000)
  * Removed appveyor.yml and mysql.mtest from CPAN releases.
  * Converted README.pod to README.md because of installation failures on
    FreeBSD, reported by Don Randolph.
