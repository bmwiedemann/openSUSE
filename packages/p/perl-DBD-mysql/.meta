  <title>MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)</title>
  <description>DBD::mysql is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database.
In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming
language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational
database management system. Most functions provided by this programming API
are supported. Some rarely used functions are missing, mainly because noone
ever requested them. :-)</description>
