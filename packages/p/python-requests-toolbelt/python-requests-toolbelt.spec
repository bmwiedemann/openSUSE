%description
This is just a collection of utilities for `python-requests`_, but don't
really belong in ``requests`` proper. The minimum tested requests version is
``2.1.0``. In reality, the toolbelt should work with ``2.0.1`` as well, but
some idiosyncracies prevent effective or sane testing on that version.
