  <title>Tool to scan your Perl code for its prerequisites</title>
  <description>Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite is yet another prerequisites scanner. It passes almost all the scanning tests for Perl::PrereqScanner and Module::ExtractUse (ie. except for a few dubious ones), and runs slightly faster than PPI-based Perl::PrereqScanner. However, it doesn't run as fast as Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite (which uses an XS lexer).

Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite also recognizes 'eval'. Prerequisites in 'eval' are not considered as requirements, but you can collect them as suggestions.

Conditional requirements or requirements loaded in a block are treated as recommends. Noed modules are stored separately (since 0.94). You may or may not need to merge them into requires.

Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite can also recognize some of the new language features such as 'say', subroutine signatures, and postfix dereferences, to improve the minimum perl requirement (since 0.9905).</description>
