%description
Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite is yet another prerequisites scanner. It
passes almost all the scanning tests for Perl::PrereqScanner and
Module::ExtractUse (ie. except for a few dubious ones), and runs slightly
faster than PPI-based Perl::PrereqScanner. However, it doesn't run as fast
as Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite (which uses an XS lexer).

Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite also recognizes 'eval'. Prerequisites in
'eval' are not considered as requirements, but you can collect them as
suggestions.

Conditional requirements or requirements loaded in a block are treated as
recommends. Noed modules are stored separately (since 0.94). You may or may
not need to merge them into requires.

Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite can also recognize some of the new
language features such as 'say', subroutine signatures, and postfix
dereferences, to improve the minimum perl requirement (since 0.9905).
