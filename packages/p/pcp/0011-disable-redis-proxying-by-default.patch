Subject: [PATCH] pmproxy: disable Redis protocol proxying by default

If a redis-server has been locked down in terms of connections,
we want to prevent pmproxy from being allowed to send arbitrary
RESP commands to it.

This protocol proxying doesn't affect PCP functionality at all,
its more of a developer/sysadmin convenience when Redis used in
cluster mode (relatively uncommon compared to localhost mode).
