  * The Panel 1.0 release is finally here and it brings a huge

    overhauled its internal layout engine and stylesheet handling,
    making applications significantly more performant and
    customizable going forward.
  * This release marks a huge step forward in the usability of
    Panel but is also just a first step in leveraging many of the
    new capabilities that the updated layout engine and design
    system affords. In the coming months we will continue to
    improve and polish the UI and UX and make it easier for you to
    extend Panel as needed.
  * For now we want to thank the many people that contributed to
    this release either by contributing directly or by testing and
    providing feedback. Many thanks to the core contributors
    @MarcSkovMadsen, @Hoxbro, @maximlt, @jbednar, @droumis and
    @philippjfr and the outside contributors @ahuang11, @cdeil,
    @MridulS, @AndrewMaged814, @midnighter and @wendrul.

    functions by reference for simple and powerful reactivity
    (#4495, #4505, #4603, #4606)
