  =head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 6.12 - 16th Nov 2022

  B<There should be no significant differences in the performance of Devel-NYTProf
  from that of the previous release.>  This release is primarily focused on
  adapting the library to a change in Perl 5 as of release 5.37.6 in November
  2022; code contributed by Tony Cook in L<GH 200: support SSNEW*() macros
  returning SSize_t instead of
  I32|https://github.com/timbunce/devel-nytprof/pull/200>.  Corrections to
  errors in documentation contributed by joshnaitis in L<GH 198: Fix typos in
  /bin report generators|https://github.com/timbunce/devel-nytprof/pull/198>.
  'make' targets dependent on Subversion (former version control system) removed
  in L<GH 196|https://github.com/timbunce/devel-nytprof/pull/196>.  CPAN module
  Sub::Name added as test-time prerequisite.

  =head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 6.11 - 19th Sep 2021

  Removed F<lib/Devel/NYTProf/js/jquery.floatThead.min.js> in L<GH 194: Remove
  jquery.floatThead.min.js|https://github.com/timbunce/devel-nytprof/pull/194>.
  In L<GH 192: nytprofhtml - internal anchor links in html pages go to wrong
  locations|https://github.com/timbunce/devel-nytprof/issues/192> Shawn Laffan
  reported that internal links to anchors in the generated HTML pages were not
  correctly positioned in the vertical dimension.   Discontinuing use of this
  Javascript file appears to correct the problem.
