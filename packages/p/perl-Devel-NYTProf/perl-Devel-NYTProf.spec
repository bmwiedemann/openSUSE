%description
Devel::NYTProf is a powerful, fast, feature-rich perl source code profiler.

  * Performs per-line statement profiling for fine detail

  * Performs per-subroutine statement profiling for overview

  * Performs per-opcode profiling for slow perl builtins

  * Performs per-block statement profiling (the first profiler to do so)

  * Accounts correctly for time spent after calls return

  * Performs inclusive and exclusive timing of subroutines

  * Subroutine times are per calling location (a powerful feature)

  * Can profile compile-time activity, just run-time, or just END time

  * Uses novel techniques for efficient profiling

  * Sub-microsecond (100ns) resolution on supported systems

  * Very fast - the fastest statement and subroutine profilers for perl

  * Handles applications that fork, with no performance cost

  * Immune from noise caused by profiling overheads and I/O

  * Program being profiled can stop/start the profiler

  * Generates richly annotated and cross-linked html reports

  * Captures source code, including string evals, for stable results

  * Trivial to use with mod_perl - add one line to httpd.conf

  * Includes an extensive test suite

  * Tested on very large codebases

NYTProf is effectively two profilers in one: a statement profiler, and a
subroutine profiler.
