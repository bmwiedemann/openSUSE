<package name="perl-YAML-Syck" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper</title>
  <description>This module provides a Perl interface to the *libsyck* data serialization
library. It exports the 'Dump' and 'Load' functions for converting Perl
data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

*NOTE*: If you are working with other language's YAML/Syck bindings (such
as Ruby), please set '$YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping' to '1' before calling
the 'Load'/'Dump' functions. The default setting is for preserving
backward-compatibility with 'YAML.pm'.</description>
