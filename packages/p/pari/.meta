  <title>Computer Algebra System for fast computations in Number Theory</title>
  <description>PARI/GP is a computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves), but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental functions.
