%description
PARI/GP is a computer algebra system designed for fast computations
in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic
curves), but also contains a large number of other useful functions
to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials,
power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of transcendental
functions.
