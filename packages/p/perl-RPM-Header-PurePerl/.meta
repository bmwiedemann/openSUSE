  <title>A Perl only implementation of a RPM header reader</title>
  <description>
RPM::Header::PurePerl is a clone of RPM::Header written in only Perl, so it
provides a way to read a rpm package on systems where rpm is not installed. 
RPM::Header::PurePerl can be used as a drop in replacement for RPM::Header,
if needed also the other way round.
