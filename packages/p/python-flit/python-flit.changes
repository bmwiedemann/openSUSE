Tue Jan 14 02:39:56 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10.1:
  * flit publish can now use PyPI tokens stored in keyring (PR #649), either
    project tokens with a ‘username’ like pypi_token:project:project_name
    (use the normalised form of the name) or user tokens
    (pypi_token:user:username).
  * The --python option can now take the path of a virtualenv folder, as an
    alternative to a Python executable (PR #667).
  * Flit will work with current development versions of Pythona again
    (PR #684).
  * The flit command line package now requires Python 3.8 or above (PR #660).
    flit_core still works with Python 3.6 or above.
  * The metadata in packages now has the names of optional dependency
    groups (“extras”) normalised, complying with version 2.3 of the metadata
    standard (PR #676, PR #697).
  * The flit command line package now depends on pip (PR #647).
  * Fix potential substitution of environment variables into passwords read
    from .pypirc files (PR #652).
  * A warning is now shown when building packages which specify the old
    flit.buildapi backend, which should be replaced by flit_core.buildapi
    (PR #674). It’s a good idea to always set a maximum version for the
    build requirement, to protect against changes in future major versions
    of Flit.
  * Avoid using the deprecated datetime.utcfromtimestamp() (PR #682).
  * Flit now has a SECURITY.md file in the Github repository (PR #665).
  * The tests for flit_core are no longer part of the installed package,
    reducing the size of the wheels (PR #691).

Thu Sep  7 10:50:43 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.9.0:
  * New options :option:`flit build --use-vcs` and :option:`flit
    build --no-use-vcs` to enable & disable including all
    committed files in the sdist. For now --use-vcs is the
    default, but this is likely to change in a
    future version, to bring flit build in line with standard
    build frontends like python -m build
  * Sdist file names, and the name of the top-level folder in an
    sdist, are now normalised, in accordance with PEP 625
  * A statically defined version number can now be parsed from
    files called version.py, _version.py or __version__.py inside
    a packge, as well as from __init__.py, so executing code is
    required in fewer cases
  * Fix setting the flag for regular files in zip metadata
  * The timestamp embedded in the gzip wrapper for sdists now
    defaults to a fixed date, so building an sdist twice on the
    same machine should produce identical results, even without
    any special steps.

Thu Aug 10 09:01:51 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- skip install tests for better interoperability with PEP 668

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 10 06:11:46 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- Remove BuildRequire for PyYAML again. This was needed by the
  response package, which in the meantime got it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 05:53:27 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- BuildRequire PyYAML, see https://github.com/pypa/flit/issues/643

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:25:15 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:41:22 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

- Fix dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 00:29:24 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.8 
  A project name containing hyphens is now automatically translated to use underscores for the import name (PR #566).
  New option flit install --only-deps to install the dependencies of the package, but not the package itself.
  Add support for recursive globbing (**) in sdist includes and excludes (PR #550).
  Python’s bytecode cache files (__pycache__ folders and .pyc files) are now always excluded from sdists (PR #581).
  Use tomllib in Python 3.11, rather than tomli (PR #573, PR #604).
  Fix crash when unable to get a password from keyring (PR #567).
  Fix including modified files in sdist when using Mercurial (PR #541).
  Fix for some cases of determining whether a package supports Python 2 or not (PR #593).
  Fix parsing version number from code using multiple assignments (PR #474).
  Document how to use a PyPI token with FLIT_PASSWORD (PR #602).
  Fix link to information about environment variables for pip (PR #576).
  Link to the docs for the latest stable version in package metadata (PR #589).
  Remove a mention of the toml package, which is no longer needed, from the Developing Flit page (PR #601).
  The bootstrap install script for flit_core accepts a new --install-root option.
  Ensure the license file is included in packages on PyPI (PR #603).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 25 12:11:30 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 3.7.1
  * Support for external data files such as man pages or Jupyter
    extension support files (PR #510).
  * Project names are now lowercase in wheel filenames and
    .dist-info folder names, in line with the specifications (PR
    #498).
  * Improved support for bootstrapping a Python environment, e.g.
    for downstream packagers (PR #511). flit_core.wheel is usable
    with python -m to create wheels before the build tool is
    available, and flit_core sdists also include a script to
    install itself from a wheel before installer is available.
  * Use newer importlib APIs, fixing some deprecation warnings (PR
    #499).
  * Fix building packages which need execution to get the version
    number, and have a relative import in __init__.py (PR #531).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  9 12:21:30 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 3.6
  * flit_core now bundles the tomli TOML parser library (version
    1.2.3) to avoid a circular dependency between flit_core and
    tomli (:ghpull:`492`). This means flit_core now has no
    dependencies except Python itself, both at build time and at
    runtime, simplifying :doc:`bootstrapping <bootstrap>`.
- The above is not fully applicale to openSUSE, we debundle.
- Release notes for Version 3.5.1
  * Fix development installs with flit install --symlink and
    --pth-file, which were broken in 3.5.0, especially for packages
    using a src folder (:ghpull:`472`).
- Release notes for Version 3.5
  * You can now use Flit to distribute a module or package inside a
    namespace package (as defined by PEP 420). To do this, specify
    the import name of the concrete, inner module you are packaging
    - e.g. name = "sphinxcontrib.foo" - either in the [project]
    table, or under [tool.flit.module] if you want to use a
    different name on PyPI (:ghpull:`468`).
  * Flit no longer generates a setup.py file in sdists (.tar.gz
    packages) by default (:ghpull:`462`). Modern packaging tools
    don't need this. You can use the --setup-py flag to keep adding
    it for now, but this will probably be removed at some point in
    the future.
  * Fixed how flit init handles authors' names with non-ASCII
    characters (:ghpull:`460`).
  * When flit init generates a LICENSE file, the new pyproject.toml
    now references it (:ghpull:`467`).
