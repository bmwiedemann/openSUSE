-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 00:29:24 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.8 
  A project name containing hyphens is now automatically translated to use underscores for the import name (PR #566).
  New option flit install --only-deps to install the dependencies of the package, but not the package itself.
  Add support for recursive globbing (**) in sdist includes and excludes (PR #550).
  Pythonâ€™s bytecode cache files (__pycache__ folders and .pyc files) are now always excluded from sdists (PR #581).
  Use tomllib in Python 3.11, rather than tomli (PR #573, PR #604).
  Fix crash when unable to get a password from keyring (PR #567).
  Fix including modified files in sdist when using Mercurial (PR #541).
  Fix for some cases of determining whether a package supports Python 2 or not (PR #593).
  Fix parsing version number from code using multiple assignments (PR #474).
  Document how to use a PyPI token with FLIT_PASSWORD (PR #602).
  Fix link to information about environment variables for pip (PR #576).
  Link to the docs for the latest stable version in package metadata (PR #589).
  Remove a mention of the toml package, which is no longer needed, from the Developing Flit page (PR #601).
  The bootstrap install script for flit_core accepts a new --install-root option.
  Ensure the license file is included in packages on PyPI (PR #603).

- Update to version 3.7.1
  * Support for external data files such as man pages or Jupyter
    extension support files (PR #510).
  * Project names are now lowercase in wheel filenames and
    .dist-info folder names, in line with the specifications (PR
    #498).
  * Improved support for bootstrapping a Python environment, e.g.
    for downstream packagers (PR #511). flit_core.wheel is usable
    with python -m to create wheels before the build tool is
    available, and flit_core sdists also include a script to
    install itself from a wheel before installer is available.
  * Use newer importlib APIs, fixing some deprecation warnings (PR
    #499).
  * Fix building packages which need execution to get the version
    number, and have a relative import in __init__.py (PR #531).

- Update to version 3.6
  * flit_core now bundles the tomli TOML parser library (version
    1.2.3) to avoid a circular dependency between flit_core and
    tomli (:ghpull:`492`). This means flit_core now has no
    dependencies except Python itself, both at build time and at
    runtime, simplifying :doc:`bootstrapping <bootstrap>`.
- The above is not fully applicale to openSUSE, we debundle.
- Release notes for Version 3.5.1
  * Fix development installs with flit install --symlink and
    --pth-file, which were broken in 3.5.0, especially for packages
    using a src folder (:ghpull:`472`).
- Release notes for Version 3.5
  * You can now use Flit to distribute a module or package inside a
    namespace package (as defined by PEP 420). To do this, specify
    the import name of the concrete, inner module you are packaging
    - e.g. name = "sphinxcontrib.foo" - either in the [project]
    table, or under [tool.flit.module] if you want to use a
    different name on PyPI (:ghpull:`468`).
  * Flit no longer generates a setup.py file in sdists (.tar.gz
    packages) by default (:ghpull:`462`). Modern packaging tools
    don't need this. You can use the --setup-py flag to keep adding
    it for now, but this will probably be removed at some point in
    the future.
  * Fixed how flit init handles authors' names with non-ASCII
    characters (:ghpull:`460`).
  * When flit init generates a LICENSE file, the new pyproject.toml
    now references it (:ghpull:`467`).
