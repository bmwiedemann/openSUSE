   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-UUID/Changes

  0.28 Sat Dec 29 00:59:25 EST 2018
    - Add OSSP variant of libuuid. CentOS7 (and presumably other RedHat
      derivatives) have packages for both OSSP and e2fs. Favor e2fs, if
      found, since our implementation of OSSP is probably slower.
      - Thanks to Greg Cox. [rt.cpan.org #128122]

    - REALLY fix do_uuid() typo. Really.
    - Fix pointer problems on BSD
    - Removed uuid_copy() from BSD. How did that get there? =)
    - Added yet another test for OSX segfault!
    - Check and set -DPERL__UUID__UUID_BUF_SZ=?? in Makefile.PL
      (Should be the same everywhere, right? Right?)
  
  0.14 Wed Dec 24 22:39:42 EST 2014
    - Fix typo in Windows do_uuid() for compiler fail on strawberry
    - Now checking for all header files instead of taking first

    - Modified test.pl to hopefully catch where MacOSX fails
    - Heavy mods to Makefile.PL to differentiate between interfaces
    - Makefile.PL *lots* more verbose

  0.11 Mon Dec 22 19:03:09 EST 2014
    - Looks like I've managed to cut the failure reports down a little TOO
      far, so now splitting the search for -luuid into two separate
      phases. The first, which I don't want to deal with right now, tests
      for usability of the -luuid flag by itself. The second, tests for
      usability of individual functions. We'll deal with platforms that
      actually find libuuid first, then MAYBE revisit others.

    - Added clear() and is_null()
