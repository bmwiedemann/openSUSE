  0.28 Sat Dec 29 00:59:25 EST 2018
    - Add OSSP variant of libuuid. CentOS7 (and presumably other RedHat
      derivatives) have packages for both OSSP and e2fs. Favor e2fs, if
      found, since our implementation of OSSP is probably slower.
      - Thanks to Greg Cox. [rt.cpan.org #128122]

  0.27 Fri Sep 23 01:52:00 EDT 2016
    - Update SYNOPSIS to remove ":all". Indiscriminate exports could cause
      problems with other modules, such as File::Copy::copy().

      unbuffered to match Devel::CheckLib
    - Remove uuid_unparse_lower/upper() calls which don't exist
      on SunOS
    - Ignore TEST_REQUIRES on EUMM < 6.64
    - Try to find correct link lib (-lrpcrt4, -luuid, -lc, in order)
    - Make string argument a char** for uuid_to_string()
    - Add note on Linux UUID packages
    - Moved test.pl to t/test.t and updated to Test::More

    - Removed Makefile.PL verbosity
    - Added switch to Makefile.PL to incite verbosity

    - Added build notice for missing header/libraries
    - Bail out of build if uuid_t size == 0
    - Reorganized header/library search to find wayward OSX
      - Thanks to David Wheeler and William Faulk for pointers and
        lots of patience in testing. [rt.cpan.org #104394]

  0.22 Sun Dec 28 08:42:23 EST 2014
    - Ugh! Forgot to include rpcdce.h in UUID.xs
  
  0.21 Sun Dec 28 08:35:23 EST 2014
    - Instead of unistd.h, try rpcdce.h on Win
    - Minor cleanup in test.pl

  0.17 Fri Dec 26 05:05:13 EST 2014
    - Removed two nested comments on BSD /* sigh */
    - Let e2fs machines use sv_cmp too (let's see if OSX Frankenbox works)
    - Changed warns in Makefile.PL to prints
  
  0.16 Thu Dec 25 18:24:23 EST 2014
    - Typo on Windows/BSD

  0.15 Thu Dec 25 05:55:13 EST 2014
    - REALLY fix do_uuid() typo. Really.
    - Fix pointer problems on BSD
    - Removed uuid_copy() from BSD. How did that get there? =)
    - Added yet another test for OSX segfault!
    - Check and set -DPERL__UUID__UUID_BUF_SZ=?? in Makefile.PL
      (Should be the same everywhere, right? Right?)
  
  0.14 Wed Dec 24 22:39:42 EST 2014
    - Fix typo in Windows do_uuid() for compiler fail on strawberry
    - Now checking for all header files instead of taking first
    - Added more detail for failed interface search
    - Added check for uuid struct size

    - Split -luuid search into header file and interface type stages
    - Removed SvPV_nolen everywhere (buffer overflows)
  
  0.12 Wed Dec 24 03:07:50 EST 2014
    - Added support for non-e2fs systems (BSD, OSX, Win)
  
  0.11_01 Tue Dec 23 20:23:29 EST 2014
    - Modified test.pl to hopefully catch where MacOSX fails
    - Heavy mods to Makefile.PL to differentiate between interfaces
    - Makefile.PL *lots* more verbose
    - Lots of #ifdefs added in XS
    - First shot at code that works for BSD style interface
  
  0.11 Mon Dec 22 19:03:09 EST 2014
    - Looks like I've managed to cut the failure reports down a little TOO
      far, so now splitting the search for -luuid into two separate
      phases. The first, which I don't want to deal with right now, tests
      for usability of the -luuid flag by itself. The second, tests for
      usability of individual functions. We'll deal with platforms that
      actually find libuuid first, then MAYBE revisit others.
  
  0.10 Mon Dec 22 11:55:30 EST 2014
    - Added clear() and is_null()
    - Added copy() and compare()
