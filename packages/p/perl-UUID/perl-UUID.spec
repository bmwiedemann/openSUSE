%description
The UUID library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects that
may be accessible beyond the local system. For instance, they could be used
to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple web servers without
communication between the servers, and without fear of a name clash.

The generated UUIDs can be reasonably expected to be unique within a
system, and unique across all systems, and are compatible with those
created by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing
Environment (DCE) utility uuidgen.
