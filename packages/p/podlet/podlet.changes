- update to version 0.3.0~0:
  Big release for Podlet!
  In case you didn't already notice, Podlet is now officially a
  part of the Containers community! As a part of the transition, a
  new code of conduct, security policy, and contribution guidelines
  were added (#76). Additionally, the Podlet container image is now
  available at ghcr.io/containers/podlet. The existing images at
  quay.io/k9withabone/podlet and docker.io/k9withabone/podlet are
  deprecated and will not be receiving updates.

  Under the hood, the library used to deserialize Compose files was
  changed (#73). As a result, only Compose files which follow the
  Compose specification are supported. The top-level version field
  is completely ignored. Most Compose files should still work as
  before.  This was a large change so look out for bugs.

  Added support for Quadlet options introduced in Podman v5.0.0
  (#75). The headline feature is support for generating Quadlet
  .pod files. They can be generated from:
  * A Podman command with podlet podman pod create.
  * A Compose file with podlet compose --pod.
  * An existing pod with podlet generate pod.
    - This creates a .pod file and a .container file for each
      container in the pod.

  Note that the existing option for generating Kubernetes Pod YAML
  from a Compose file was renamed to podlet compose --kube. Both
  the --pod and --kube options of podlet compose do not take an
  argument and instead require the top-level name field in the
  Compose file. The name is used as the name of the pod and in the
  filename of the created files.

  * Features
    - Add podlet --binds-to option.
    - BREAKING (compose) Rename podlet compose --pod to podlet
      compose --kube.
    - (container) Add Entrypoint= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Add StopTimeout= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Support Notify=healthy Quadlet option.
    - (container) Support no-dereference option for Mount=.
    - (container) Add podman run --preserve-fd option.
    - (container) Add podman run --gpus option.

    - Add podman --config global option.
    - (pod) Generate .pod Quadlet file from command.
      - Adds the podlet podman pod create subcommand.
      - The --infra-conmon-pidfile and --pod-id-file options were
        deliberately not implemented as they are set by Quadlet in
        the generated {name}-pod.service file and can't be set
        multiple times.
    - BREAKING (compose) Re-add podlet compose --pod option.
      - The --pod option causes podlet to create a .pod Quadlet
        file in addition to the .container, .volume, and .network
        files. The containers are linked to the pod and their
        published ports are moved.
    - (generate) Quadlet files from an existing pod and its
      containers.
      - Adds the podlet generate pod subcommand.

        - Deserializes the output.
        - Parses the pod creation command.
        - Does the same for each of the pod's containers.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Use Quadlet serializer for Unit Display implementation (#64).
      - Brings Unit inline with the other sections of the generated
        Quadlet file.
    - (container) Add podman run --uts option.
    - (container) --pids-limit range is -1..=u32::MAX.
    - (container) Enforce --blkio-weight range 10..=1000.
    - (container) --blkio-weight-device can be specified multiple
      times.
    - (container) Don't add empty PodmanArgs= when downgrading
      Podman version.
    - Correct use of eyre::bail!() on non-Unix platforms.

      - Suggests the use of conventional commits and clarifies that
        the Signed-off-by footer is required for a PR to be merged.

        integration sections from the README.md file to the new
