- Update to version 0.3.1~0:
  This is a fairly large release which includes a number of bug
  fixes and new features. In the future, the goal is to have
  smaller releases more frequently. Here are some highlights of
  this release:
  * Added support for Quadlet options introduced in Podman v5.1.0
    (#85) and v5.2.0 (#123). This includes support for creating
    .build Quadlet files with podlet podman build and from the
    build section of a service in a Compose file.
  * Added the -s, --split-options option (#168) which allows the
    user to specify which Quadlet options should be split onto
    multiple lines.
    By default, Podlet combines all Quadlet options that can be
    into a space separated list.
    For example, podlet podman run -e ONE=one -e TWO=two image
    results in:

      # image.container
      [Container]
      Environment=ONE=one TWO=two
      Image=image

    While podlet -s Environment podman run -e ONE=one -e TWO=two
    image results in:

      # image.container
      [Container]
      Environment=ONE=one
      Environment=TWO=two
      Image=image

    See podlet --help for more information and all Quadlet options
    that can be split.
  * Fixed a number of bugs related to Compose file handling (#122).
  * Added a Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) policy (#169)
    which can be seen in the contribution guide.
  * Features
    - (container) Add GroupAdd= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Add subpath image mount option.
    - (generate) Add options to ignore unsupported pod options.
      (#86)
      - Added --ignore-infra-conmon-pidfile and
        --ignore-pod-id-file options to podlet generate pod.
      - The --infra-conmon-pidfile and --pod-id-file options are
        deliberately unimplemented by podlet podman pod create as
        they are set by Quadlet when generating the systemd service
        unit file, and cannot be set multiple times. Because podlet
        generate pod uses podlet podman pod create internally, this
        caused an error when attempting to generate a .pod Quadlet
        file from a pod created using either of those options, such
        as those created with the deprecated podman generate
        systemd command.
    - (compose) Merge << keys. (#58)
    - (compose) Perform additional validation.
      - Ensures that networks, volumes (when used across multiple
        services), configs, and secrets used in each service are
        defined in the appropriate top-level field.
    - (container) Add LogOpt= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Add StopSignal= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Add NetworkAlias= Quadlet option.
    - (pod) Add NetworkAlias= Quadlet option.
    - (build) Generate .build Quadlet file from command.
      - Added the podlet podman build subcommand.
    - (compose) .build Quadlet files from Compose. (#100)
      - Added support to podlet compose for converting the build
        section of a Compose service to a .build Quadlet file.
    - (compose) Search for podman-compose.yaml when using podlet
      compose by [@TheRealBecks] in #167.
    - Add --split-options option. (#118)
      - By default, when generating a Quadlet file, Podlet will
        combine all Quadlet options that can be into a space
        separated list (e.g., Environment=ONE=one TWO=two). The
        --split-options option allows the user to specify which
        Quadlet options they would like Podlet to write on separate
        lines.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Support podman pod create --name option by @ananthb in #89.
    - (compose) Append .network to container network name. (#90)
    - (generate) Accept array or object from podman inspect output.
      (#94)
      - Podman v5.0.0 and newer always returns an array from podman
        inspect. Older versions of Podman may return a single JSON
        object if there is only one result, notably for podman pod
        inspect.
    - (compose) Prepend container dependencies with pod name.
      (#114)
      - When the podlet compose --pod option is used, the names of
        the services from the Compose file are prepended with the
        pod name. If a service had a dependency via the depends_on
        attribute, the name of the dependency was not similarly
        prepended with the pod name when added to the [Unit]
        section of the Quadlet file.
    - (compose) Support services[].memswap_limit.
      - The services[].memswap_limit attribute is translated to
        podman run --memory-swap.
    - (container) Support short flag -h for podman run --hostname.
      (#105)
      - Changed short help flag to -? for podlet podman run. This
        could be a potentially minor breaking change for some
        users.
    - (compose) .build Quadlet file error reporting. (#126)
      - If there was an error converting the build section of a
        Compose service it would not be reported to the user. The
        rest of the service would fail to convert to a .container
        Quadlet file as the image would not be set (it's set after
        the build section is successfully converted). The user
        would receive a "image or build is required" error as the
        service error would be reported first.
  * Documentation
    - (readme) Add homebrew to the installation section by
      @cprecioso in #80.
    - (contributing) Add MSRV policy.
      - Set MSRV to 1.85, following the Rust version in Debian
        stable.
    - (readme) Update demo, features, and usage.
  * Refactor
    - Add generic impls of HostPaths trait.
    - Destruct tuples to enhance readability by @Integral-Tech.
    - impl Serialize for podlet::quadlet::File.
      - Changed podlet::serde::quadlet::Serializer to accept
        sequences and tuples in addition to structs. Elements in a
        sequence are serialized as separate sections. Tuples are
        combined into a single section (for combining
        podlet::quadlet::Resource and podlet::quadlet::Globals).
  * Miscellaneous
    - (release-container) Add --all to buildah manifest push. (#82)
    - Add Podman v5.1.0 to PodmanVersion.
    - (deps) Update compose_spec to v0.3.0. (#91, #96, #106, #117)
    - Add Podman v5.2.0 to PodmanVersion.
    - (ci) Add msrv job.
    - Update to Rust 2024 edition.
      - Includes changes to formatting for the Rust 2024 style
        edition.
    - (deps) Replace nix with rustix.
    - (lints) Fix Clippy lints.
    - (release) Update dist.
      - Formerly known as cargo-dist.

- update to version 0.3.0~0:
  Big release for Podlet!
  In case you didn't already notice, Podlet is now officially a
  part of the Containers community! As a part of the transition, a
  new code of conduct, security policy, and contribution guidelines
  were added (#76). Additionally, the Podlet container image is now
  available at ghcr.io/containers/podlet. The existing images at
  quay.io/k9withabone/podlet and docker.io/k9withabone/podlet are
  deprecated and will not be receiving updates.

  Under the hood, the library used to deserialize Compose files was
  changed (#73). As a result, only Compose files which follow the
  Compose specification are supported. The top-level version field
  is completely ignored. Most Compose files should still work as
  before.  This was a large change so look out for bugs.

  Added support for Quadlet options introduced in Podman v5.0.0
  (#75). The headline feature is support for generating Quadlet
  .pod files. They can be generated from:
  * A Podman command with podlet podman pod create.
  * A Compose file with podlet compose --pod.
  * An existing pod with podlet generate pod.
    - This creates a .pod file and a .container file for each
      container in the pod.

  Note that the existing option for generating Kubernetes Pod YAML
  from a Compose file was renamed to podlet compose --kube. Both
  the --pod and --kube options of podlet compose do not take an
  argument and instead require the top-level name field in the
  Compose file. The name is used as the name of the pod and in the
  filename of the created files.

  * Features
    - Add podlet --binds-to option.
    - BREAKING (compose) Rename podlet compose --pod to podlet
      compose --kube.
    - (container) Add Entrypoint= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Add StopTimeout= Quadlet option.
    - (container) Support Notify=healthy Quadlet option.
    - (container) Support no-dereference option for Mount=.
    - (container) Add podman run --preserve-fd option.
    - (container) Add podman run --gpus option.
    - (container) Add podman run --retry option.
    - (container) Add podman run --retry-delay option.
    - Add podman --config global option.
    - (pod) Generate .pod Quadlet file from command.
      - Adds the podlet podman pod create subcommand.
      - The --infra-conmon-pidfile and --pod-id-file options were
        deliberately not implemented as they are set by Quadlet in
        the generated {name}-pod.service file and can't be set
        multiple times.
    - BREAKING (compose) Re-add podlet compose --pod option.
      - The --pod option causes podlet to create a .pod Quadlet
        file in addition to the .container, .volume, and .network
        files. The containers are linked to the pod and their
        published ports are moved.
    - (generate) Quadlet files from an existing pod and its
      containers.
      - Adds the podlet generate pod subcommand.
        - Runs podman pod inspect on the given pod.
        - Deserializes the output.
        - Parses the pod creation command.
        - Does the same for each of the pod's containers.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Use Quadlet serializer for Unit Display implementation (#64).
      - Brings Unit inline with the other sections of the generated
        Quadlet file.
    - (container) Add podman run --uts option.
    - (container) --pids-limit range is -1..=u32::MAX.
    - (container) Enforce --blkio-weight range 10..=1000.
    - (container) --blkio-weight-device can be specified multiple
      times.
    - (container) Don't add empty PodmanArgs= when downgrading
      Podman version.
    - Correct use of eyre::bail!() on non-Unix platforms.
  * Documentation
    - (clippy) Fix Clippy lint warning for Idmap.
    - (compose) --kube help add name requirement.
    - Add code of conduct.
    - Add security policy.
    - Update links to the repository.
      - The repository is now at
        https://github.com/containers/podlet.
    - (contributing) Add contribution guidelines.
      - Adapted from the Buildah/Podman contribution guidelines.
      - Suggests the use of conventional commits and clarifies that
        the Signed-off-by footer is required for a PR to be merged.
      - Moved and expanded upon the building and continuous
        integration sections from the README.md file to the new
        CONTRIBUTING.md file.

    - (compose) Kubernetes YAML from compose_spec::Compose.
    - (container) Destructure in Quadlet option conversion.
    - (compose) Move podlet compose args into their own struct.
  * Miscellaneous
    - (deps) Remove duration-str dependency.
      . All usages were replaced with compose_spec::duration.
    - Add Podman v5.0.0 to Podman versions.
      - Also added v4.9.X aliases to 4.8 and v5.0.X aliases to 5.0.
    - (container) Reorder fields to match Quadlet docs.
    - (lints) Fix new rust 1.78 clippy lints.
