    <comment>- Update F00251-change-user-install-location.patch to install packages
  in /usr/local by default when using pip outside of a RPMBUILD
  environment.
- Update to 3.13.0~b4:
  - Tests
    - gh-121084: Fix test_typing random leaks. Clear typing ABC
      caches when running tests for refleaks (-R option): call
      _abc_caches_clear() on typing abstract classes and their
      subclasses.
    - gh-121160: Add a test for
      readline.set_history_length(). Note that this test may fail
      on readline libraries.
    - gh-121200: Fix test_expanduser_pwd2() of
      test_posixpath. Call getpwnam() to get pw_dir, since it
      can be different than getpwall() pw_dir.
    - gh-121188: When creating the JUnit XML file, regrtest
      now escapes characters which are invalid in XML, such
      as the chr(27) control character used in ANSI escape
      sequences.
  - Library
    - gh-57141: The shallow argument to filecmp.dircmp (new in
      Python 3.13) is now keyword-only.
    - gh-121245: Simplify handling of the history file in
      site.register_readline() helper. The CAN_USE_PYREPL
      variable now will be initialized, when imported.
    - gh-121332: Fix constructor of ast nodes with custom
      _attributes. Previously, passing custom attributes would
      raise a DeprecationWarning. Passing arguments to the
      constructor that are not in _fields or _attributes remains
      deprecated.
    - gh-121279: Avoid NameError for the warnings module when
      accessing the depracated atributes of the importlib.abc
      module.
    - gh-121245: Fix a bug in the handling of the command history
      of the new REPL that caused the history file to be wiped at
      REPL exit.
    - gh-87744: Fix waitpid race while calling send_signal() in
      asyncio.
    - gh-121018: Fixed other issues where argparse.ArgumentParser
      did not honor exit_on_error=False.
    - gh-120678: Fix regression in the new REPL that meant that
      globals from files passed using the -i argument would not
      be included in the REPL’s global namespace.
    - gh-120782: Fix wrong references of the datetime types after
      reloading the module.
    - gh-120713: datetime.datetime.strftime() now 0-pads years
      with less than four digits for the format specifiers %Y and
      %G on Linux.
    - gh-117983: Defer the threading import in importlib.util
      until lazy loading is used.
    - gh-119189: When using the ** operator or pow() with
      Fraction as the base and an exponent that is not rational,
      a float, or a complex, the fraction is no longer converted
      to a float.
    - gh-118714: Allow restart in post-mortem debugging of
      pdb. Removed restart message when the user quits pdb from
      post-mortem mode.
    - gh-105623: Fix performance degradation in
      logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler.
  - IDLE
    - gh-78889: Stop Shell freezes by blocking user access to
      non-method sys.stdout.shell attributes, which are all
      private.
  - Documentation
    - gh-121749: Fix documentation for PyModule_AddObjectRef().
    - gh-120012: Clarify the behaviours of
      multiprocessing.Queue.empty() and
      multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.empty() on closed queues.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-121860: Fix crash when rematerializing a managed
      dictionary after it was deleted.
    - gh-121814: Fixed the SegFault when PyEval_SetTrace() is
      used with no Python frame on stack.
    - gh-121295: Fix PyREPL console getting into a blocked state
      after interrupting a long paste
    - gh-121794: Fix bug in free-threaded Python where a
      resurrected object could lead to a negative ref count
      assertion failure.
    - gh-121657: Improve the SyntaxError message if the user
      tries to use yield from outside a function.
    - gh-121609: Fix pasting of characters containing unicode
      character joiners in the new REPL. Patch by Marta Gomez
      Macias
    - gh-117482: Unexpected slot wrappers are no longer created
      for builtin static types in subinterpreters.
    - gh-121499: Fix a bug affecting how multi-line history was
      being rendered in the new REPL after interacting with the
      new screen cache. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121497: Fix a bug that was preventing the REPL to
      correctly respect the history when an input hook was
      set. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121012: Tier 2 execution now ensures that list iterators
      remain exhausted, once they become exhausted.
    - gh-121439: Allow tuples of length 20 in the freelist to be
      reused.
    - gh-121368: Fix race condition in _PyType_Lookup in the
      free-threaded build due to a missing memory fence. This
      could lead to _PyType_Lookup returning incorrect results on
      arm64.
    - gh-121130: Fix f-strings with debug expressions in format
      specifiers. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121115: PyLong_AsNativeBytes() no longer
      uses __index__() methods by default. The
      Py_ASNATIVEBYTES_ALLOW_INDEX flag has been added to allow
      it.
  - C API
    - gh-89364: Export the PySignal_SetWakeupFd()
      function. Previously, the function was documented but
      it couldn’t be used in 3rd party code. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-113993: PyUnicode_InternInPlace() no longer
      Seprevents its argument from being garbage collected
      Several functions that take char * are now documented
      Seas possibly preventing string objects from being
      Segarbage collected; refer to their documentation
      Sefor details: PyUnicode_InternFromString(),
      SePyDict_SetItemString(), PyObject_SetAttrString(),
      SePyObject_DelAttrString(), PyUnicode_InternFromString(),
      Seand PyModule_Add* convenience functions
    - gh-113601: Removed debug build assertions related to
      interning strings, which were falsely triggered by stable
      ABI extensions.
    - gh-112136: Restore the private _PyArg_Parser structure and
      the private _PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywordsFast() function,
      previously removed in Python 3.13 alpha 1. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
  - Build
    - gh-120371: Support WASI SDK 22 by explicitly skipping
      functions that are just stubs in wasi-libc.
    - gh-121731: Fix mimalloc compile error on GNU/Hurd
    - gh-121487: Fix deprecation warning for ATOMIC_VAR_INIT in
      mimalloc.
    - gh-121467: Fix a Makefile bug that prevented mimalloc
      header files from being installed.
    - gh-121103: On POSIX systems, excluding macOS framework
      installs, the lib directory for the free-threaded build now
      includes a “t” suffix to avoid conflicts with a co-located
      default build installation.
    - gh-120831: The default minimum iOS version was increased to
      13.0.
    - gh-113565: Improve curses and curses.panel dependency
      checks in configure.
- Remove %suse_update_desktop_file macro as it is not useful any
  more.

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 3.13.0~rc3:
  - The most important change is rolling back the incremental
    cyclic garbage collector (GC), which was added in one of
    the alpha releases. The incremental GC had more significant
    performance regressions in specific workloads than we
    expected.
  - Tests
    - gh-124378: Updated test_ttk to pass with Tcl/Tk 8.6.15.
  - Library
    - gh-124538: Fixed crash when using gc.get_referents() on a
      capsule object.
    - gh-124498: Fix typing.TypeAliasType not to be generic, when
      type_params is an empty tuple.
    - gh-123017: Due to unreliable results on some devices,
      time.strftime() no longer accepts negative years on
      Android.
    - gh-123014: os.pidfd_open() and signal.pidfd_send_signal()
      are now unavailable when building against Android API
      levels older than 31, since the underlying system calls may
      cause a crash.
    - gh-124248: Fixed potential crash when using struct to
      process zero-width ‘Pascal string’ fields (0p).
    - gh-87041: Fix a bug in argparse where lengthy subparser
      argument help is incorrectly indented.
    - gh-124212: Fix invalid variable in venv handling of failed
      symlink on Windows
    - gh-124171: Add workaround for broken fmod() implementations
      on Windows, that loose zero sign (e.g. fmod(-10, 1) returns
      0.0). Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-123934: Fix unittest.mock.MagicMock reseting magic
      methods return values after .reset_mock(return_value=True)
      was called.
    - gh-123968: Fix the command-line interface for the random
      module to select floats between 0 and N, not 1 and N.
    - gh-123892: Add &quot;_wmi&quot; to sys.stdlib_module_names. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-123339: Fix inspect.getsource() for classes
      in collections.abc and decimal (for pure Python
      implementation) modules. inspect.getcomments() now raises
      OSError instead of IndexError if the __firstlineno__ value
      for a class is out of bound.
    - gh-121735: When working with zip archives,
      importlib.resources now properly honors module-adjacent
      references (e.g. files(pkg.mod) and not just files(pkg)).
    - gh-122145: Fix an issue when reporting tracebacks
      corresponding to Python code emitting an empty AST
      body. Patch by Nikita Sobolev and Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-119004: Fix a crash in OrderedDict.__eq__ when operands
      are mutated during the check. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - bpo-44864: Do not translate user-provided strings in
      argparse.ArgumentParser.
  - IDLE
    - gh-112938: Fix uninteruptable hang when Shell gets rapid
      continuous output.
    - gh-120104: Fix padding in config and search dialog windows
      in IDLE.
  - Documentation
    - gh-124720: Update “Using Python on a Mac” section of the
      “Python Setup and Usage” document and include information
      on installing free-threading support.
    - gh-116622: Add an Android platform guide, and flag modules
      not available on Android.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-124567: Revert the incremental GC (in 3.13), since it’s
      not clear the benefits outweigh the costs at this point.
    - gh-124642: Fixed scalability issue in free-threaded builds
      for lock-free reads from dictionaries in multi-threaded
      scenarios
    - gh-116510: Fix a bug that can cause a crash when
      sub-interpreters use “basic” single-phase extension
      modules. Shared objects could refer to PyGC_Head nodes that
      had been freed as part of interpreter cleanup.
    - gh-124547: When deallocating an object with inline values
      whose __dict__ is still live: if memory allocation for the
      inline values fails, clear the dictionary. Prevents an
      interpreter crash.
    - gh-124513: Fix a crash in FrameLocalsProxy constructor:
      check the number of arguments. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-124442: Fix nondeterminism in compilation by sorting the
      value of __static_attributes__. Patch by kp2pml30.
    - gh-123856: Fix PyREPL failure when a keyboard interrupt is
      triggered after using a history search
    - gh-65961: Document the deprecation of setting and using
      __package__ and __cached__.
    - gh-124027: Support &lt;page up&gt;, &lt;page down&gt;, and &lt;delete&gt;
      keys in the Python REPL when $TERM is set to vt100.
    - gh-77894: Fix possible crash in the garbage collector when
      it tries to break a reference loop containing a memoryview
      object. Now a memoryview object can only be cleared if
      there are no buffers that refer it.
    - gh-123339: Setting the __module__ attribute for a class now
      removes the __firstlineno__ item from the type’s dict, so
      they will no longer be inconsistent.
  - C API
    - gh-124160: Fix crash when importing modules containing
      state and single-phase initialization in a subinterpreter.
    - gh-123880: Fixed a bug that prevented circular imports of
      extension modules that use single-phase initialization.
  - Build
    - gh-124487: Windows builds now use Windows 8.1 as their API
      baseline (installation already required Windows 8.1).
    - gh-124043: Building using --with-trace-refs is
      (temporarily) disallowed when the GIL is disabled.
- Remove upstreamed patch:
  - gh-124040-fix-test-math-i586.patch

    <time>1728401098</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 3.13.0:
  Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12
  Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:
  - New features
    - A new and improved interactive interpreter, based on
      PyPy's, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as
      well as colorized exception tracebacks.
    - An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables
      the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run
      more concurrently. The build mode is available as an
      experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as
      well.
    - A preliminary, experimental JIT, providing the ground work
      for significant performance improvements.
    - The locals() builtin function (and its C equivalent)
      now has well-defined semantics when mutating the
      returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more
      consistently.
    - A modified version of mimalloc is now included, optional
      but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and
      required for the free-threaded build mode.
    - Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped,
      reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools
      handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)
    - The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used
      by default when creating new files.
    - WASI is now a Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is
      no longer an officially supported platform (but Pyodide
      continues to support Emscripten).
  - Typing
    - Support for type defaults in type parameters.
    - A new type narrowing annotation, typing.TypeIs.
    - A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts.
    - A new annotation for marking deprecations in the type
      system.
  - Removals and new deprecations
    - PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)
      scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc,
      audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib,
      nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau,
      telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.
    - Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and
      methods in various standard library modules.
    - C API removals and deprecations. (Some removals present
      in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals were
      deemed too disruptive at this time.)
    - New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal
      from Python 3.15 or 3.16.
  - For more details on the changes to Python 3.13, see What's
    new in Python 3.13 in the documentation.
