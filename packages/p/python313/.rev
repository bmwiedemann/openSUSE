    <comment>- Update F00251-change-user-install-location.patch to install packages
  in /usr/local by default when using pip outside of a RPMBUILD
  environment.
- Update to 3.13.0~b4:
  - Tests
    - gh-121084: Fix test_typing random leaks. Clear typing ABC
      caches when running tests for refleaks (-R option): call
      _abc_caches_clear() on typing abstract classes and their
      subclasses.
    - gh-121160: Add a test for
      readline.set_history_length(). Note that this test may fail
      on readline libraries.
    - gh-121200: Fix test_expanduser_pwd2() of
      test_posixpath. Call getpwnam() to get pw_dir, since it
      can be different than getpwall() pw_dir.
    - gh-121188: When creating the JUnit XML file, regrtest
      now escapes characters which are invalid in XML, such
      as the chr(27) control character used in ANSI escape
      sequences.
  - Library
    - gh-57141: The shallow argument to filecmp.dircmp (new in
      Python 3.13) is now keyword-only.
    - gh-121245: Simplify handling of the history file in
      site.register_readline() helper. The CAN_USE_PYREPL
      variable now will be initialized, when imported.
    - gh-121332: Fix constructor of ast nodes with custom
      _attributes. Previously, passing custom attributes would
      raise a DeprecationWarning. Passing arguments to the
      constructor that are not in _fields or _attributes remains
      deprecated.
    - gh-121279: Avoid NameError for the warnings module when
      accessing the depracated atributes of the importlib.abc
      module.
    - gh-121245: Fix a bug in the handling of the command history
      of the new REPL that caused the history file to be wiped at
      REPL exit.
    - gh-87744: Fix waitpid race while calling send_signal() in
      asyncio.
    - gh-121018: Fixed other issues where argparse.ArgumentParser
      did not honor exit_on_error=False.
    - gh-120678: Fix regression in the new REPL that meant that
      globals from files passed using the -i argument would not
      be included in the REPL’s global namespace.
    - gh-120782: Fix wrong references of the datetime types after
      reloading the module.
    - gh-120713: datetime.datetime.strftime() now 0-pads years
      with less than four digits for the format specifiers %Y and
      %G on Linux.
    - gh-117983: Defer the threading import in importlib.util
      until lazy loading is used.
    - gh-119189: When using the ** operator or pow() with
      Fraction as the base and an exponent that is not rational,
      a float, or a complex, the fraction is no longer converted
      to a float.
    - gh-118714: Allow restart in post-mortem debugging of
      pdb. Removed restart message when the user quits pdb from
      post-mortem mode.
    - gh-105623: Fix performance degradation in
      logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler.
  - IDLE
    - gh-78889: Stop Shell freezes by blocking user access to
      non-method sys.stdout.shell attributes, which are all
      private.
  - Documentation
    - gh-121749: Fix documentation for PyModule_AddObjectRef().
    - gh-120012: Clarify the behaviours of
      multiprocessing.Queue.empty() and
      multiprocessing.SimpleQueue.empty() on closed queues.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-121860: Fix crash when rematerializing a managed
      dictionary after it was deleted.
    - gh-121814: Fixed the SegFault when PyEval_SetTrace() is
      used with no Python frame on stack.
    - gh-121295: Fix PyREPL console getting into a blocked state
      after interrupting a long paste
    - gh-121794: Fix bug in free-threaded Python where a
      resurrected object could lead to a negative ref count
      assertion failure.
    - gh-121657: Improve the SyntaxError message if the user
      tries to use yield from outside a function.
    - gh-121609: Fix pasting of characters containing unicode
      character joiners in the new REPL. Patch by Marta Gomez
      Macias
    - gh-117482: Unexpected slot wrappers are no longer created
      for builtin static types in subinterpreters.
    - gh-121499: Fix a bug affecting how multi-line history was
      being rendered in the new REPL after interacting with the
      new screen cache. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121497: Fix a bug that was preventing the REPL to
      correctly respect the history when an input hook was
      set. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121012: Tier 2 execution now ensures that list iterators
      remain exhausted, once they become exhausted.
    - gh-121439: Allow tuples of length 20 in the freelist to be
      reused.
    - gh-121368: Fix race condition in _PyType_Lookup in the
      free-threaded build due to a missing memory fence. This
      could lead to _PyType_Lookup returning incorrect results on
      arm64.
    - gh-121130: Fix f-strings with debug expressions in format
      specifiers. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-121115: PyLong_AsNativeBytes() no longer
      uses __index__() methods by default. The
      Py_ASNATIVEBYTES_ALLOW_INDEX flag has been added to allow
      it.
  - C API
    - gh-89364: Export the PySignal_SetWakeupFd()
      function. Previously, the function was documented but
      it couldn’t be used in 3rd party code. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-113993: PyUnicode_InternInPlace() no longer
      Seprevents its argument from being garbage collected
      Several functions that take char * are now documented
      Seas possibly preventing string objects from being
      Segarbage collected; refer to their documentation
      Sefor details: PyUnicode_InternFromString(),
      SePyDict_SetItemString(), PyObject_SetAttrString(),
      SePyObject_DelAttrString(), PyUnicode_InternFromString(),
      Seand PyModule_Add* convenience functions
    - gh-113601: Removed debug build assertions related to
      interning strings, which were falsely triggered by stable
      ABI extensions.
    - gh-112136: Restore the private _PyArg_Parser structure and
      the private _PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywordsFast() function,
      previously removed in Python 3.13 alpha 1. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
  - Build
    - gh-120371: Support WASI SDK 22 by explicitly skipping
      functions that are just stubs in wasi-libc.
    - gh-121731: Fix mimalloc compile error on GNU/Hurd
    - gh-121487: Fix deprecation warning for ATOMIC_VAR_INIT in
      mimalloc.
    - gh-121467: Fix a Makefile bug that prevented mimalloc
      header files from being installed.
    - gh-121103: On POSIX systems, excluding macOS framework
      installs, the lib directory for the free-threaded build now
      includes a “t” suffix to avoid conflicts with a co-located
      default build installation.
    - gh-120831: The default minimum iOS version was increased to
      13.0.
    - gh-113565: Improve curses and curses.panel dependency
      checks in configure.
- Remove %suse_update_desktop_file macro as it is not useful any
  more.

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 3.13.0~rc3:
  - The most important change is rolling back the incremental
    cyclic garbage collector (GC), which was added in one of
    the alpha releases. The incremental GC had more significant
    performance regressions in specific workloads than we
    expected.
  - Tests
    - gh-124378: Updated test_ttk to pass with Tcl/Tk 8.6.15.
  - Library
    - gh-124538: Fixed crash when using gc.get_referents() on a
      capsule object.
    - gh-124498: Fix typing.TypeAliasType not to be generic, when
      type_params is an empty tuple.
    - gh-123017: Due to unreliable results on some devices,
      time.strftime() no longer accepts negative years on
      Android.
    - gh-123014: os.pidfd_open() and signal.pidfd_send_signal()
      are now unavailable when building against Android API
      levels older than 31, since the underlying system calls may
      cause a crash.
    - gh-124248: Fixed potential crash when using struct to
      process zero-width ‘Pascal string’ fields (0p).
    - gh-87041: Fix a bug in argparse where lengthy subparser
      argument help is incorrectly indented.
    - gh-124212: Fix invalid variable in venv handling of failed
      symlink on Windows
    - gh-124171: Add workaround for broken fmod() implementations
      on Windows, that loose zero sign (e.g. fmod(-10, 1) returns
      0.0). Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-123934: Fix unittest.mock.MagicMock reseting magic
      methods return values after .reset_mock(return_value=True)
      was called.
    - gh-123968: Fix the command-line interface for the random
      module to select floats between 0 and N, not 1 and N.
    - gh-123892: Add &quot;_wmi&quot; to sys.stdlib_module_names. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-123339: Fix inspect.getsource() for classes
      in collections.abc and decimal (for pure Python
      implementation) modules. inspect.getcomments() now raises
      OSError instead of IndexError if the __firstlineno__ value
      for a class is out of bound.
    - gh-121735: When working with zip archives,
      importlib.resources now properly honors module-adjacent
      references (e.g. files(pkg.mod) and not just files(pkg)).
    - gh-122145: Fix an issue when reporting tracebacks
      corresponding to Python code emitting an empty AST
      body. Patch by Nikita Sobolev and Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-119004: Fix a crash in OrderedDict.__eq__ when operands
      are mutated during the check. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - bpo-44864: Do not translate user-provided strings in
      argparse.ArgumentParser.
  - IDLE
    - gh-112938: Fix uninteruptable hang when Shell gets rapid
      continuous output.
    - gh-120104: Fix padding in config and search dialog windows
      in IDLE.
  - Documentation
    - gh-124720: Update “Using Python on a Mac” section of the
      “Python Setup and Usage” document and include information
      on installing free-threading support.
    - gh-116622: Add an Android platform guide, and flag modules
      not available on Android.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-124567: Revert the incremental GC (in 3.13), since it’s
      not clear the benefits outweigh the costs at this point.
    - gh-124642: Fixed scalability issue in free-threaded builds
      for lock-free reads from dictionaries in multi-threaded
      scenarios
    - gh-116510: Fix a bug that can cause a crash when
      sub-interpreters use “basic” single-phase extension
      modules. Shared objects could refer to PyGC_Head nodes that
      had been freed as part of interpreter cleanup.
    - gh-124547: When deallocating an object with inline values
      whose __dict__ is still live: if memory allocation for the
      inline values fails, clear the dictionary. Prevents an
      interpreter crash.
    - gh-124513: Fix a crash in FrameLocalsProxy constructor:
      check the number of arguments. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-124442: Fix nondeterminism in compilation by sorting the
      value of __static_attributes__. Patch by kp2pml30.
    - gh-123856: Fix PyREPL failure when a keyboard interrupt is
      triggered after using a history search
    - gh-65961: Document the deprecation of setting and using
      __package__ and __cached__.
    - gh-124027: Support &lt;page up&gt;, &lt;page down&gt;, and &lt;delete&gt;
      keys in the Python REPL when $TERM is set to vt100.
    - gh-77894: Fix possible crash in the garbage collector when
      it tries to break a reference loop containing a memoryview
      object. Now a memoryview object can only be cleared if
      there are no buffers that refer it.
    - gh-123339: Setting the __module__ attribute for a class now
      removes the __firstlineno__ item from the type’s dict, so
      they will no longer be inconsistent.
  - C API
    - gh-124160: Fix crash when importing modules containing
      state and single-phase initialization in a subinterpreter.
    - gh-123880: Fixed a bug that prevented circular imports of
      extension modules that use single-phase initialization.
  - Build
    - gh-124487: Windows builds now use Windows 8.1 as their API
      baseline (installation already required Windows 8.1).
    - gh-124043: Building using --with-trace-refs is
      (temporarily) disallowed when the GIL is disabled.
- Remove upstreamed patch:
  - gh-124040-fix-test-math-i586.patch

    <time>1728401098</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to 3.13.0:
  Major new features of the 3.13 series, compared to 3.12
  Some of the new major new features and changes in Python 3.13 are:
  - New features
    - A new and improved interactive interpreter, based on
      PyPy's, featuring multi-line editing and color support, as
      well as colorized exception tracebacks.
    - An experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables
      the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing threads to run
      more concurrently. The build mode is available as an
      experimental feature in the Windows and macOS installers as
      well.
    - A preliminary, experimental JIT, providing the ground work
      for significant performance improvements.
    - The locals() builtin function (and its C equivalent)
      now has well-defined semantics when mutating the
      returned mapping, which allows debuggers to operate more
      consistently.
    - A modified version of mimalloc is now included, optional
      but enabled by default if supported by the platform, and
      required for the free-threaded build mode.
    - Docstrings now have their leading indentation stripped,
      reducing memory use and the size of .pyc files. (Most tools
      handling docstrings already strip leading indentation.)
    - The dbm module has a new dbm.sqlite3 backend that is used
      by default when creating new files.
    - WASI is now a Tier 2 supported platform. Emscripten is
      no longer an officially supported platform (but Pyodide
      continues to support Emscripten).
  - Typing
    - Support for type defaults in type parameters.
    - A new type narrowing annotation, typing.TypeIs.
    - A new annotation for read-only items in TypeDicts.
    - A new annotation for marking deprecations in the type
      system.
  - Removals and new deprecations
    - PEP 594 (Removing dead batteries from the standard library)
      scheduled removals of many deprecated modules: aifc,
      audioop, chunk, cgi, cgitb, crypt, imghdr, mailcap, msilib,
      nis, nntplib, ossaudiodev, pipes, sndhdr, spwd, sunau,
      telnetlib, uu, xdrlib, lib2to3.
    - Many other removals of deprecated classes, functions and
      methods in various standard library modules.
    - C API removals and deprecations. (Some removals present
      in alpha 1 were reverted in alpha 2, as the removals were
      deemed too disruptive at this time.)
    - New deprecations, most of which are scheduled for removal
      from Python 3.15 or 3.16.
  - For more details on the changes to Python 3.13, see What's
    new in Python 3.13 in the documentation.

    - gh-126807: Fix extraction warnings in pygettext.py caused
      by mistaking function definitions for function calls.
    - gh-126167: The iOS testbed was modified so that it can be
      used by third-party projects for testing purposes.
  - Tests
    - gh-126909: Fix test_os extended attribute tests to work on
      filesystems with 1 KiB xattr size limit.
    - gh-125041: Re-enable skipped tests for zlib on the
      s390x architecture: only skip checks of the compressed
      bytes, which can be different between zlib’s software
      implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.
    - gh-124295: Add translation tests to the argparse module.

      consistently use the mapped IPv4 address value for deciding
      properties. Properties which have their behavior fixed are
      is_multicast, is_reserved, is_link_local, is_global, and
      is_unspecified.

    <comment>SHOULD GO BACK TO openSUSE:Factory:Staging:O

- adjusted sofilename for &quot;nogil&quot; build correctly.
- Update to 3.13.5:
  - Tests
    - gh-135120: Add test.support.subTests().
  - Library

      implementation of pickle.
    - gh-135276: Backported bugfixes in zipfile.Path from
      zipp 3.23. Fixed .name, .stem and other basename-based
      properties on Windows when working with a zipfile on disk.
    - gh-134151: email: Fix TypeError in
      email.utils.decode_params() when sorting RFC 2231
      continuations that contain an unnumbered section.
    - gh-134152: email: Fix parsing of email message ID with
      invalid domain.
    - gh-127081: Fix libc thread safety issues with os by
      replacing getlogin with getlogin_r re-entrant version.
    - gh-131884: Fix formatting issues in json.dump() when both
      indent and skipkeys are used.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-135171: Roll back changes to generator and list
      comprehensions that went into 3.13.4 to fix gh-127682,
      but which involved semantic and bytecode changes not
      appropriate for a bugfix release.
  - C API
    - gh-134989: Fix Py_RETURN_NONE, Py_RETURN_TRUE and
      Py_RETURN_FALSE macros in the limited C API 3.11 and
      older: don’t treat Py_None, Py_True and Py_False as
      immortal. Patch by Victor Stinner.

  flexible and covering even unexpected changes.
- Update to 3.13.4:
  - Security
    - gh-135034: Fixes multiple issues that allowed tarfile
      extraction filters (filter=&quot;data&quot; and filter=&quot;tar&quot;) to be
      bypassed using crafted symlinks and hard links.
      Addresses CVE-2024-12718 (bsc#1244056), CVE-2025-4138
      (bsc#1244059), CVE-2025-4330 (bsc#1244060), and
      CVE-2025-4517 (bsc#1244032).
    - gh-133767: Fix use-after-free in the “unicode-escape”
      decoder with a non-“strict” error handler (CVE-2025-4516,
      bsc#1243273).
    - gh-128840: Short-circuit the processing of long IPv6
      addresses early in ipaddress to prevent excessive memory
      consumption and a minor denial-of-service.
  - Library
    - gh-134718: ast.dump() now only omits None and [] values if
      they are default values.
    - gh-128840: Fix parsing long IPv6 addresses with embedded
      IPv4 address.
    - gh-134696: Built-in HACL* and OpenSSL implementations of
      hash function constructors now correctly accept the same
      documented named arguments. For instance, md5() could be
      previously invoked as md5(data=data) or md5(string=string)
      depending on the underlying implementation but these calls
      were not compatible. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-134210: curses.window.getch() now correctly handles
      signals. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-80334: multiprocessing.freeze_support() now checks for
      work on any “spawn” start method platform rather than only
      on Windows.
    - gh-114177: Fix asyncio to not close subprocess pipes which
      would otherwise error out when the event loop is already
      closed.
    - gh-134152: Fixed UnboundLocalError that could occur during
      email header parsing if an expected trailing delimiter is
      missing in some contexts.
    - gh-62184: Remove import of C implementation of io.FileIO
      from Python implementation which has its own implementation
    - gh-133982: Emit RuntimeWarning in the Python implementation
      of io when the file-like object is not closed explicitly in
      the presence of multiple I/O layers.
    - gh-133890: The tarfile module now handles
      UnicodeEncodeError in the same way as OSError when cannot
      extract a member.
    - gh-134097: Fix interaction of the new REPL and -X
      showrefcount command line option.
    - gh-133889: The generated directory listing page in
      http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler now only shows the
      decoded path component of the requested URL, and not the
      query and fragment.
    - gh-134098: Fix handling paths that end with
      a percent-encoded slash (%2f or %2F) in
      http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
    - gh-134062: ipaddress: fix collisions in __hash__() for
      IPv4Network and IPv6Network objects.
    - gh-133745: In 3.13.3 we accidentally changed the signature
      of the asyncio create_task() family of methods and how it
      calls a custom task factory in a backwards incompatible
      way. Since some 3rd party libraries have already made
      changes to work around the issue that might break if
      we simply reverted the changes, we’re instead changing
      things to be backwards compatible with 3.13.2 while still
      supporting those workarounds for 3.13.3. In particular, the
      special-casing of name and context is back (until 3.14) and
      consequently eager tasks may still find that their name
      hasn’t been set before they execute their first yielding
      await.
    - gh-71253: Raise ValueError in open() if opener returns a
      negative file-descriptor in the Python implementation of io
      to match the C implementation.
    - gh-77057: Fix handling of invalid markup declarations in
      html.parser.HTMLParser.
    - gh-133489: random.getrandbits() can now generate more that
      231 bits. random.randbytes() can now generate more that 256
      MiB.
    - gh-133290: Fix attribute caching issue when setting
      ctypes._Pointer._type_ in the undocumented and deprecated
      ctypes.SetPointerType() function and the undocumented
      set_type() method.
    - gh-132876: ldexp() on Windows doesn’t round subnormal
      results before Windows 11, but should. Python’s
      math.ldexp() wrapper now does round them, so results may
      change slightly, in rare cases of very small results, on
      Windows versions before 11.
    - gh-133089: Use original timeout value for
      subprocess.TimeoutExpired when the func subprocess.run()
      is called with a timeout instead of sometimes a confusing
      partial remaining time out value used internally on the
      final wait().
    - gh-133009: xml.etree.ElementTree: Fix a crash in
      Element.__deepcopy__ when the element is concurrently
      mutated. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-132995: Bump the version of pip bundled in ensurepip to
      version 25.1.1
    - gh-132017: Fix error when pyrepl is suspended, then resumed
      and terminated.
    - gh-132673: Fix a crash when using _align_ = 0 and _fields_
      = [] in a ctypes.Structure.
    - gh-132527: Include the valid typecode ‘w’ in the error
      message when an invalid typecode is passed to array.array.
    - gh-132439: Fix PyREPL on Windows: characters entered via
      AltGr are swallowed. Patch by Chris Eibl.
    - gh-132429: Fix support of Bluetooth sockets on NetBSD and
      DragonFly BSD.
    - gh-132106: QueueListener.start now raises a RuntimeError if
      the listener is already started.
    - gh-132417: Fix a NULL pointer dereference when a C function
      called using ctypes with restype py_object returns NULL.
    - gh-132385: Fix instance error suggestions trigger potential
      exceptions in object.__getattr__() in traceback.
    - gh-132308: A traceback.TracebackException now correctly
      renders the __context__ and __cause__ attributes from
      falsey Exception, and the exceptions attribute from falsey
      ExceptionGroup.
    - gh-132250: Fixed the SystemError in cProfile when locating
      the actual C function of a method raises an exception.
    - gh-132063: Prevent exceptions that evaluate as
      falsey (namely, when their __bool__ method returns
      False or their __len__ method returns 0) from being
      ignored by concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor and
      concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.
    - gh-119605: Respect follow_wrapped for __init__() and
      __new__() methods when getting the class signature for a
      class with inspect.signature(). Preserve class signature
      after wrapping with warnings.deprecated(). Patch by Xuehai
      Pan.
    - gh-91555: Ignore log messages generated during handling of
      log messages, to avoid deadlock or infinite recursion.
    - gh-131434: Improve error reporting for incorrect format in
      time.strptime().
    - gh-131127: Systems using LibreSSL now successfully build.
    - gh-130999: Avoid exiting the new REPL and offer suggestions
      even if there are non-string candidates when errors occur.
    - gh-130941: Fix configparser.ConfigParser parsing empty
      interpolation with allow_no_value set to True.
    - gh-129098: Fix REPL traceback reporting when using
      compile() with an inexisting file. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-130631: http.cookiejar.join_header_words() is now more
      similar to the original Perl version. It now quotes the
      same set of characters and always quote values that end
      with &quot;\n&quot;.
    - gh-129719: Fix missing socket.CAN_RAW_ERR_FILTER constant
      in the socket module on Linux systems. It was missing since
      Python 3.11.
    - gh-124096: Turn on virtual terminal mode and enable
      bracketed paste in REPL on Windows console. (If the
      terminal does not support bracketed paste, enabling it does
      nothing.)
    - gh-122559: Remove __reduce__() and __reduce_ex__() methods
      that always raise TypeError in the C implementation
      of io.FileIO, io.BufferedReader, io.BufferedWriter
      and io.BufferedRandom and replace them with default
      __getstate__() methods that raise TypeError. This restores
      fine details of behavior of Python 3.11 and older versions.
    - gh-122179: hashlib.file_digest() now raises BlockingIOError
      when no data is available during non-blocking I/O. Before,
      it added spurious null bytes to the digest.
    - gh-86155: html.parser.HTMLParser.close() no longer loses
      data when the &lt;script&gt; tag is not closed. Patch by Waylan
      Limberg.
    - gh-69426: Fix html.parser.HTMLParser to not unescape
      character entities in attribute values if they are followed
      by an ASCII alphanumeric or an equals sign.
    - bpo-44172: Keep a reference to original curses windows in
      subwindows so that the original window does not get deleted
      before subwindows.
  - Tests
    - gh-133744: Fix multiprocessing interrupt test. Add an event
      to synchronize the parent process with the child process:
      wait until the child process starts sleeping. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-133639: Fix
      TestPyReplAutoindent.test_auto_indent_default() doesn’t run
      input_code.
    - gh-133131: The iOS testbed will now select the most
      recently released “SE-class” device for testing if a device
      isn’t explicitly specified.
    - gh-109981: The test helper that counts the list of open
      file descriptors now uses the optimised /dev/fd approach on
      all Apple platforms, not just macOS. This avoids crashes
      caused by guarded file descriptors.
  - IDLE
    - gh-112936: fix IDLE: no Shell menu item in single-process
      mode.
  - Documentation
    - gh-107006: Move documentation and example code for
      threading.local from its docstring to the official docs.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-134908: Fix crash when iterating over lines in a text
      file on the free threaded build.
    - gh-127682: No longer call __iter__ twice in list
      comprehensions. This brings the behavior of list
      comprehensions in line with other forms of iteration
    - gh-134381: Fix RuntimeError when using a not-started
      threading.Thread after calling os.fork()
    - gh-128066: Fixes an edge case where PyREPL improperly threw
      an error when Python is invoked on a read only filesystem
      while trying to write history file entries.
    - gh-134100: Fix a use-after-free bug that occurs when an
      imported module isn’t in sys.modules after its initial
      import. Patch by Nico-Posada.
    - gh-133703: Fix hashtable in dict can be bigger than
      intended in some situations.
    - gh-132869: Fix crash in the free threading build when
      accessing an object attribute that may be concurrently
      inserted or deleted.
    - gh-132762: fromkeys() no longer loops forever when adding
      a small set of keys to a large base dict. Patch by Angela
      Liss.
    - gh-133543: Fix a possible memory leak that could occur when
      directly accessing instance dictionaries (__dict__) that
      later become part of a reference cycle.
    - gh-133516: Raise ValueError when constants True, False or
      None are used as an identifier after NFKC normalization.
    - gh-133441: Fix crash upon setting an attribute with a dict
      subclass. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132942: Fix two races in the type lookup cache. This
      affected the free-threaded build and could cause crashes
      (apparently quite difficult to trigger).
    - gh-132713: Fix repr(list) race condition: hold a strong
      reference to the item while calling repr(item). Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132747: Fix a crash when calling __get__() of a method
      with a None second argument.
    - gh-132542: Update Thread.native_id after fork(2) to ensure
      accuracy. Patch by Noam Cohen.
    - gh-124476: Fix decoding from the locale encoding in the
      C.UTF-8 locale.
    - gh-131927: Compiler warnings originating from the same
      module and line number are now only emitted once, matching
      the behaviour of warnings emitted from user code. This can
      also be configured with warnings filters.
    - gh-127682: No longer call __iter__ twice when creating and
      executing a generator expression. Creating a generator
      expression from a non-interable will raise only when the
      generator expression is executed. This brings the behavior
      of generator expressions in line with other generators.
    - gh-131878: Handle uncaught exceptions in the main input
      loop for the new REPL.
    - gh-131878: Fix support of unicode characters with two or
      more codepoints on Windows in the new REPL.

      string source and a non-None closure. Patch by Bartosz
      Sławecki.

      inconsitently in format specifiers for single-quoted
      f-strings. Patch by Pablo Galindo.

    another method on the object (such as ssl.SSLSocket.send) was
    subsequently called in another thread.
  - gh-137044: Return large limit values as positive integers
    instead of negative integers in resource.getrlimit().
    Accept large values and reject negative values (except
    RLIM_INFINITY) for limits in resource.setrlimit().

    for objects decorated with functools.cache() or
    functools.cached_property.
  - gh-131788: Make ResourceTracker.send from multiprocessing

    disabling profiling or tracing across all threads with
    PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads() or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads()
    or their Python equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads()
    and threading.setprofile_all_threads().

  (CVE-2025-6075, bsc#1252974).

- Add CVE-2025-8291-consistency-zip64.patch which checks
  consistency of the zip64 end of central directory record, and
  preventing obfuscation of the payload, i.e., you scanning for
  malicious content in a ZIP file with one ZIP parser (let's say
  a Rust one) then unpack it in production with another (e.g.,
  the Python one) and get malicious content that the other parser
  did not see (CVE-2025-8291, bsc#1251305)

    <comment>- Add pass-test_write_read_limited_history.patch:
  Fix readline history truncation when length is reduced
 
  The `readline.set_history_length()` function did not previously
  truncate the in-memory history when the new length was set to
  a value smaller than the current number of history items. This
  could lead to unexpected behavior where `get_history_length()`
  would still report the old length and writing the history to a
  file would write more entries than the new limit.
 
  This patch modifies `set_history_length()` to explicitly
  remove the oldest history entries using `remove_history()`
  when the length is decreased, ensuring the in-memory history
  is correctly truncated to the new limit. This brings the
  function's behavior in line with expectations and fixes
  failures in `test_write_read_limited_history`.</comment>
