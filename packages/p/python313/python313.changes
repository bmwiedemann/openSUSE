Fri Jun 28 06:12:20 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 3.13.0~b2:
  * Core and Builtins
    - gh-119462: Make sure that invariants of type versioning are
      maintained:
      * Superclasses always have their version number assigned
        before subclasses
      * The version tag is always zero if the tag is not valid.
      * The version tag is always non-zero if the tag is valid.
    - gh-120437: Fix _CHECK_STACK_SPACE optimization problems
      introduced in gh-118322.
    - gh-120722: Correctly set the bytecode position on return
      instructions within lambdas. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-120367: Fix bug where compiler creates a redundant
      jump during pseudo-op replacement. Can only happen with
      a synthetic AST that has a try on the same line as the
      instruction following the exception handler.
    - gh-113993: Strings interned with sys.intern() are again
      garbage-collected when no longer used, as per the
      documentation. Strings interned with the C function
      PyUnicode_InternInPlace() are still immortal. Internals of
      the string interning mechanism have been changed. This may
      affect performance and identities of str objects.
    - gh-120384: Fix an array out of bounds crash in
      list_ass_subscript, which could be invoked via some
      specificly tailored input: including concurrent
      modification of a list object, where one thread assigns a
      slice and another clears it.
    - gh-120367: Fix crash in compiler on code with redundant
      NOPs and JUMPs which show up after exception handlers are
      moved to the end of the code.
    - gh-120400: Support Linux perf profiler to see Python calls
      on RISC-V architecture.
    - gh-120221: Deliver real signals on Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z in the
      new REPL. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-120346: Respect PYTHON_BASIC_REPL when running in
      interative inspect mode (python -i). Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-93691: Fix source locations of instructions generated
      for the iterator of a for statement.
    - gh-120198: Fix a crash when multiple threads read and write
      to the same __class__ of an object concurrently.
    - gh-120298: Fix use-after free in list_richcompare_impl
      which can be invoked via some specificly tailored evil
      input.
    - gh-119666: Fix a compiler crash in the case where two
      comprehensions in class scope both reference __class__.
    - gh-120225: Fix crash in compiler on empty block at end of
      exception handler.
    - gh-119933: Improve SyntaxError messages for invalid
      expressions in a type parameters bound, a type parameter
      constraint tuple or a default type parameter. Patch by
      Bénédikt Tran
    - bpo-24766: Fix handling of doc argument to subclasses of
      property
  * Library
    - gh-119614: Fix truncation of strings with embedded null
      characters in some internal operations in tkinter.
    - gh-120910: When reading installed files from an egg, use
      relative_to(walk_up=True) to honor files installed outside
      of the installation root.
    - gh-101830: Accessing the tkinter object’s string
      representation no longer converts the underlying Tcl object
      to a string on Windows.
    - gh-120811: Fix possible memory leak in
      contextvars.Context.run().
    - gh-120769: Make empty line in pdb repeats the last command
      even when the command is from cmdqueue.
    - gh-120732: Fix name passing to unittest.mock.Mock object
      when using unittest.mock.create_autospec().
    - gh-120683: Fix an error in logging.LogRecord, when the
      integer part of the timestamp is rounded up, while the
      millisecond calculation truncates, causing the log
      timestamp to be wrong by up to 999 ms (affected roughly 1
      in 8 million timestamps).
    - gh-120633: Move scrollbar and remove tear-off menus in
      turtledemo.
    - gh-120541: Improve the prompt in the “less” pager when
      help() is called with non-string argument.
    - gh-120495: Fix incorrect exception handling in Tab
      Nanny. Patch by Wulian233.
    - gh-120381: Correct inspect.ismethoddescriptor() to
      check also for the lack of __delete__(). Patch by Jan
      Kaliszewski.
    - gh-90425: The OS byte in gzip headers is now always set to
      255 when using gzip.compress().

      after multiline f-strings in the tokenize module.
    - gh-119600: Fix unittest.mock.patch() to not read attributes
      of the target when new_callable is set. Patch by Robert
      Collins.
    - gh-114053: Fix erroneous NameError when calling
      inspect.get_annotations() with eval_str=True` on a class
      that made use of PEP 695 type parameters in a module that
      had from __future__ import annotations at the top of the
      file. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-120268: Prohibit passing None to pure-Python
      datetime.date.fromtimestamp() to achieve consistency with
      C-extension implementation.
    - gh-120244: Fix memory leak in re.sub() when the replacement
      string contains backreferences.
    - gh-120211: Fix tkinter.ttk with Tcl/Tk 9.0.
    - gh-71587: Fix crash in C version of
      datetime.datetime.strptime() when called again on the
      restarted interpreter.
    - gh-120161: datetime no longer crashes in certain complex
      reference cycle situations.

    - gh-65454: unittest.mock.Mock.attach_mock() no longer
      triggers a call to a PropertyMock being attached.
    - gh-81936: help() and showtopic() methods now respect a
      configured output argument to pydoc.Helper and not use the
      pager in such cases. Patch by Enrico Tröger.
    - gh-119577: The DeprecationWarning emitted when testing
      the truth value of an xml.etree.ElementTree.Element now
      describes unconditionally returning True in a future
      version rather than raising an exception in Python 3.14.
    - gh-118908: Limit exposed globals from internal imports and
      definitions on new REPL startup. Patch by Eugene Triguba
      and Pablo Galindo.

      of the non-limited C API.
    - gh-118789: Add

    - gh-118773: Fixes creation of ACLs in os.mkdir() on Windows to
      work correctly on non-English machines.
    - gh-118486: os.mkdir() on Windows now accepts mode of 0o700 to
      restrict the new directory to the current user. This fixes

      the base temporary directory is more permissive than the
      default.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-119724: Reverted improvements to error messages for elif/else
      statements not matching any valid statements, which made in hard
      to locate the syntax errors inside those elif/else blocks.
    - gh-119842: Honor PyOS_InputHook() in the new REPL. Patch by
      Pablo Galindo
    - gh-119821: Fix execution of annotation scopes within classes

      Galindo
    - gh-111999: Fix the signature of str.format_map().
    - gh-119560: An invalid assert in beta 1 has been removed. The
      assert would fail if PyState_FindModule() was used in an
      extension module’s init function before the module def had been
      initialized.
    - gh-119369: Fix deadlock during thread deletion in free-threaded
      build, which could occur when the GIL was enabled at runtime.
    - gh-119525: Fix deadlock involving _PyType_Lookup() cache in the

    - gh-119213: Non-builtin modules built with argument clinic were
      crashing if used in a subinterpreter before the main
      interpreter. The objects that were causing the problem by
      leaking between interpreters carelessly have been fixed.
    - gh-119011: Fixes type.__type_params__ to return an empty tuple
      instead of a descriptor.
    - gh-118692: Avoid creating unnecessary StopIteration instances

      the interpreter’s main thread that occur in free-threaded
      builds.
    - gh-118507: Speedup os.path.isjunction() and os.path.lexists() on
      Windows with a native implementation.
    - gh-118561: Fix race condition in free-threaded build where
      list.extend() could expose uninitialised memory to concurrent
      readers.
    - gh-118263: Speed up os.path.splitroot() & os.path.normpath()
      with a direct C call.
    - gh-117195: Avoid assertion failure for debug builds when calling
      object.__sizeof__(1)
  - Library
    - gh-119819: Fix regression to allow logging configuration with
      multiprocessing queue types.
    - gh-117142: The ctypes module may now be imported in all
      subinterpreters, including those that have their own GIL.
    - gh-118835: Fix _pyrepl crash when using custom prompt with ANSI
      escape codes.
    - gh-117398: The _datetime module (C implementation for datetime)
      now supports being imported in multiple interpreters.
    - gh-89727: Fix issue with shutil.rmtree() where a RecursionError
      is raised on deep directory trees.
    - gh-89727: Partially fix issue with shutil.rmtree() where a
      RecursionError is raised on deep directory trees. A recursion
      error is no longer raised when rmtree.avoids_symlink_attacks is
      false.
    - gh-119118: Fix performance regression in the tokenize module by
      caching the line token attribute and calculating the column
      offset more efficiently.
    - gh-89727: Fix issue with os.fwalk() where a RecursionError was
      raised on deep directory trees by adjusting the implementation
      to be iterative instead of recursive.
    - gh-119588: zipfile.Path.is_symlink now assesses if the given
      path is a symlink.
    - gh-119555: Catch SyntaxError from compile() in the runsource()
      method of the InteractiveColoredConsole. Patch by Sergey B
      Kirpichev.
    - gh-113892: Now, the method sock_connect of
      asyncio.ProactorEventLoop raises a ValueError if given socket is
      not in non-blocking mode, as well as in other loop
      implementations.
    - gh-119443: The interactive REPL no longer runs with from
      __future__ import annotations enabled. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-117398: Objects in the datetime C-API are now all statically
      allocated, which means better memory safety, especially when the
      module is reloaded. This should be transparent to users.
    - gh-118894: asyncio REPL now has the same capabilities as PyREPL.
    - gh-118911: In PyREPL, updated maybe-accept’s logic so that if
      the user hits Enter twice, they are able to terminate the block
      even if there’s trailing whitespace. Also, now when the user
      hits arrow up, the cursor is on the last functional line. This
      matches IPython’s behavior. Patch by Aya Elsayed.
    - gh-111201: Remove dependency to readline from the new Python
      REPL.
    - gh-119174: Fix high DPI causes turtledemo(turtle-graphics

      frame is not available.
    - gh-92081: Fix missing spaces in email headers when the spaces
      are mixed with encoded 8-bit characters.
    - gh-103194: Prepare Tkinter for C API changes in Tcl 8.7/9.0 to
      avoid _tkinter.Tcl_Obj being unexpectedly returned instead of
      bool, str, bytearray, or int.
    - gh-87106: Fixed handling in inspect.Signature.bind() of keyword
      arguments having the same name as positional-only arguments when
      a variadic keyword argument (e.g. **kwargs) is present.

      checker (-R option). Patch by Victor Stinner.  Buil- d
    - gh-119729: On POSIX systems, the pkg-config (.pc) filenames now
      include the ABI flags, which may include debug (“d”) and
      free-threaded (“t”). For example: * python-3.14.pc (default,

      PyGILState_Ensure() calls a destructor that during
      PyThreadState_Clear() that calls back into PyGILState_Ensure()
      and PyGILState_Release(). This might occur when in the
      free-threaded build or when using thread-local variables whose
      destructors call PyGILState_Ensure().
    - gh-119336: Restore the removed _PyLong_NumBits() function. It is
      used by the pywin32 project. Patch by Ethan Smith
    - gh-119247: Added Py_BEGIN_CRITICAL_SECTION_SEQUENCE_FAST and

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  9 08:18:00 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0b1:
  - Security
    - gh-116741: Update bundled libexpat to 2.6.2
    - gh-117233: Detect BLAKE2, SHA3, Shake, & truncated SHA512 support
      in the OpenSSL-ish libcrypto library at build time. This allows
      hashlib to be used with libraries that do not to support every
      algorithm that upstream OpenSSL does.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-118414: Add instrumented opcodes to YIELD_VALUE assertion for
      tracing cases.
    - gh-117953: When a builtin or extension module is imported for
      the first time, while a subinterpreter is active, the module’s
      init function is now run by the main interpreter first before
      import continues in the subinterpreter. Consequently,
      single-phase init modules now fail in an isolated subinterpreter
      without the init function running under that interpreter,
      whereas before it would run under the subinterpreter before
      failing, potentially leaving behind global state and callbacks
      and otherwise leaving the module in an inconsistent state.
    - gh-117549: Don’t use designated initializer syntax in inline
      functions in internal headers. They cause problems for C++ or
      MSVC users who aren’t yet using the latest C++ standard (C++20).
      While internal, pycore_backoff.h, is included (indirectly, via
      pycore_code.h) by some key 3rd party software that does so for
      speed.
    - gh-95382: Improve performance of json.dumps() and json.dump()
      when using the argument indent. Depending on the data the
      encoding using json.dumps() with indent can be up to 2 to 3
      times faster.
    - gh-116322: In --disable-gil builds, the GIL will be enabled
      while loading C extension modules. If the module indicates that
      it supports running without the GIL, the GIL will be disabled
      once loading is complete. Otherwise, the GIL will remain enabled
      for the remainder of the interpreter’s lifetime. This behavior
      does not apply if the GIL has been explicitly enabled or
      disabled with PYTHON_GIL or -Xgil.
    - gh-118513: Fix incorrect UnboundLocalError when two
      comprehensions in the same function both reference the same
      name, and in one comprehension the name is bound while in the
      other it’s an implicit global.
    - gh-118518: Allow the Linux perf support to work without frame
      pointers using perf’s advanced JIT support. The feature is
      activated when using the PYTHON_PERF_JIT_SUPPORT environment
      variable or when running Python with -Xperf_jit. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - gh-117514: Add sys._is_gil_enabled() function that returns
      whether the GIL is currently enabled. In the default build it
      always returns True because the GIL is always enabled. In the
      free-threaded build, it may return True or False.
    - gh-118164: Break a loop between the Python implementation of the
      decimal module and the Python code for integer to string
      conversion. Also optimize integer to string conversion for
      values in the range from 9_000 to 135_000 decimal digits.
    - gh-118473: Fix sys.set_asyncgen_hooks() not to be partially set
      when raising TypeError.
    - gh-118465: Compiler populates the new __firstlineno__ field on a
      class with the line number of the first line of the class
      definition.
    - gh-118492: Fix an issue where the type cache can expose a
      previously accessed attribute when a finalizer is run.
    - gh-117714: update async_generator.athrow().close() and
      async_generator.asend().close() to close their section of the
      underlying async generator
    - gh-111201: The interactive interpreter is now implemented in
      Python, which allows for a number of new features like colors,
      multiline input, history viewing, and paste mode. Contributed by
      Pablo Galindo, Łukasz Langa and Lysandros Nikolaou based on code
      from the PyPy project.
    - gh-74929: Implement PEP 667: converted FrameType.f_locals and
      PyFrame_GetLocals() to return a write-through proxy object when
      the frame refers to a function or comprehension.
    - gh-116767: Fix crash in compiler on ‘async with’ that has many
      context managers.
    - gh-118335: Change how to use the tier 2 interpreter. Instead of
      running Python with -X uops or setting the environment variable
      PYTHON_UOPS=1, this choice is now made at build time by
      configuring with --enable-experimental-jit=interpreter.
    - Beware! This changes the environment variable to enable or
      disable micro-ops to PYTHON_JIT. The old PYTHON_UOPS is no
      longer used.
    - gh-118306: Update JIT compilation to use LLVM 18
    - gh-118160: Annotation scopes within classes can now contain
      comprehensions. However, such comprehensions are not inlined
      into their parent scope at runtime. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-118272: Fix bug where generator.close does not free the
      generator frame’s locals.
    - gh-118216: Don’t consider __future__ imports with dots before
      the module name.
    - gh-118074: Make sure that the Executor objects in the COLD_EXITS
      array aren’t assumed to be GC-able (which would access bytes
      outside the object).
    - gh-107674: Lazy load frame line number to improve performance of
      tracing
    - gh-118082: Improve SyntaxError message for imports without
      names, like in from x import and import cases. It now points out
      to users that import expects at least one name after it.
    - gh-118090: Improve SyntaxError message for empty type param
      brackets.
    - gh-102511: Speed up os.path.splitroot() with a native
      implementation.
    - gh-117958: Added a get_jit_code() method to access JIT compiled
      machine code from the UOp Executor when the experimental JIT is
      enabled. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - gh-117901: Add option for compiler’s codegen to save nested
      instruction sequences for introspection.
    - gh-116622: Redirect stdout and stderr to system log when
      embedded in an Android app.
    - gh-109118: annotation scope within class scopes can now contain
      lambdas.
    - gh-117894: Prevent agen.aclose() objects being re-used after
      .throw().
    - gh-117881: prevent concurrent access to an async generator via
      athrow().throw() or asend().throw()
    - gh-115874: Fixed a possible segfault during garbage collection
      of _asyncio.FutureIter objects
    - gh-117536: Fix a RuntimeWarning when calling
      agen.aclose().throw(Exception).
    - gh-117755: Fix mimalloc allocator for huge memory allocation
      (around 8,589,934,592 GiB) on s390x. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117750: Fix issue where an object’s dict would get out of
      sync with the object’s internal values when being cleared.
      obj.__dict__.clear() now clears the internal values, but leaves
      the dict attached to the object.
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following bytes and
      bytearray methods by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling
      convention:
        count()
        find()
        index()
        rfind()
        rindex()
    - gh-117709: Speed up calls to str() with positional-only
      argument, by using the PEP 590 vectorcall calling convention.
      Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-117680: Give _PyInstructionSequence a Python interface and
      use it in tests.
    - gh-115776: Statically allocated objects are, by definition,
      immortal so must be marked as such regardless of whether they
      are in extension modules or not.
    - gh-117641: Speedup os.path.commonpath() on Unix.
    - gh-117636: Speedup os.path.join().
    - gh-117607: Speedup os.path.relpath().
    - gh-117385: Remove unhandled PY_MONITORING_EVENT_BRANCH and
      PY_MONITORING_EVENT_EXCEPTION_HANDLED events from
      sys.settrace().
    - gh-116322: Extension modules may indicate to the runtime that
      they can run without the GIL. Multi-phase init modules do so by
      calling providing Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED for the Py_mod_gil slot,
      while single-phase init modules call
      PyUnstable_Module_SetGIL(mod, Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED) from their
      init function.
    - gh-116129: Implement PEP 696, adding support for defaults on
      type parameters. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-93502: Add two new functions to the C-API,
      PyRefTracer_SetTracer() and PyRefTracer_GetTracer(), that allows
      to track object creation and destruction the same way the
      tracemalloc module does. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-107674: Improved the performance of sys.settrace()
      significantly
    - gh-95754: Improve the error message when a script shadowing a
      module from the standard library causes AttributeError to be
      raised. Similarly, improve the error message when a script
      shadowing a third party module attempts to access an attribute
      from that third party module while still initialising.
    - gh-99180: Elide uninformative traceback indicators in return and
      simple assignment statements. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-105879: Allow the globals and locals arguments to exec() and
      eval() to be passed as keywords.
  - Library
    - gh-118418: A DeprecationWarning is now emitted if you fail to
      pass a value to the new type_params parameter of
      typing._eval_type() or typing.ForwardRef._evaluate(). (Using
      either of these private and undocumented functions is
      discouraged to begin with, but failing to pass a value to the
      type_params parameter may lead to incorrect behaviour on Python
      3.12 or newer.)
    - gh-118660: Add an optional second type parameter to
      typing.ContextManager and typing.AsyncContextManager,
      representing the return types of __exit__() and __aexit__()
      respectively. This parameter defaults to bool | None.
    - gh-118650: The enum module allows method named _repr_* to be
      defined on Enum types.
    - gh-118648: Add type parameter defaults to typing.Generator and
      typing.AsyncGenerator.
    - gh-101137: Mime type text/x-rst is now supported by mimetypes.
    - gh-118164: The Python implementation of the decimal module could
      appear to hang in relatively small power cases (like 2**117) if
      context precision was set to a very high value. A different
      method to check for exactly representable results is used now
      that doesn’t rely on computing 10**precision (which could be
      effectively too large to compute).
    - gh-111744: breakpoint() and pdb.set_trace() now enter the
      debugger immediately after the call rather than before the next
      line is executed.
    - gh-118500: Add pdb support for zipapps
    - gh-118406: Add signature for sqlite3.Connection objects.
    - gh-101732: Use a Y2038 compatible openssl time function when
      available.
    - gh-118404: Fix inspect.signature() for non-comparable callables.
    - gh-118402: Fix inspect.signature() for the result of the
      functools.cmp_to_key() call.
    - gh-116622: On Android, sysconfig.get_platform now returns the
      format specified by PEP 738.
    - gh-118285: Allow to specify the signature of custom callable
      instances of extension type by the __text_signature__ attribute.
      Specify signatures of operator.attrgetter, operator.itemgetter,
      and operator.methodcaller instances.
    - gh-118314: Fix an edge case in binascii.a2b_base64() strict
      mode, where excessive padding is not detected when no padding is
      necessary.
    - gh-118271: Add the PhotoImage methods read() to read an image
      from a file and data() to get the image data. Add background and
      grayscale parameters to PhotoImage method write().
    - gh-118225: Add the PhotoImage method copy_replace() to copy a
      region from one image to other image, possibly with pixel
      zooming and/or subsampling. Add from_coords parameter to
      PhotoImage methods copy(), zoom() and subsample(). Add zoom and
      subsample parameters to PhotoImage method copy().
    - gh-118221: Fix a bug where sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() could
      fail if a custom row factory was used. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
    - gh-118013: Fix regression introduced in gh-103193 that meant
      that calling inspect.getattr_static() on an instance would cause
      a strong reference to that instance’s class to persist in an
      internal cache in the inspect module. This caused unexpected
      memory consumption if the class was dynamically created, the
      class held strong references to other objects which took up a
      significant amount of memory, and the cache contained the sole
      strong reference to the class. The fix for the regression leads
      to a slowdown in getattr_static(), but the function should still
      be significantly faster than it was in Python 3.11. Patch by
      Alex Waygood.
    - gh-118218: Speed up itertools.pairwise() in the common case by
      up to 1.8x.
    - gh-117486: Improve the behavior of user-defined subclasses of
      ast.AST. Such classes will now require no changes in the usual
      case to conform with the behavior changes of the ast module in
      Python 3.13. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-90848: Fixed unittest.mock.create_autospec() to configure
      parent mock with keyword arguments.
    - gh-118168: Fix incorrect argument substitution when
      typing.Unpack is used with the builtin tuple. typing.Unpack now
      raises TypeError when used with certain invalid types. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-118131: Add command-line interface for the random module.
      Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-118107: Fix zipimport reading of ZIP64 files with file
      entries that are too big or offset too far.
    - gh-117535: Change the unknown filename of warnings from sys to
      <sys> to clarify that it’s not a real filename.
    - gh-114053: Fix erroneous NameError when calling
      typing.get_type_hints() on a class that made use of PEP 695 type
      parameters in a module that had from __future__ import
      annotations at the top of the file. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-116931: Add parameter fileobj check for
      tarfile.TarFile.addfile()
    - gh-117995: Don’t raise DeprecationWarning when a sequence of
      parameters is used to bind indexed, nameless placeholders. See
      also gh-100668.
    - gh-80361: Fix TypeError in email.Message.get_payload() when the
      charset is RFC 2231 encoded.
    - gh-86650: Fix IndexError when parse some emails with invalid
      Message-ID (including one-off addresses generated by Microsoft
      Outlook).
    - gh-117691: Improve the error messages emitted by tarfile
      deprecation warnings relating to PEP 706. If a filter argument
      is not provided to extract() or extractall, the deprecation
      warning now points to the line in the user’s code where the
      relevant function was called. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by omitting an initial
      is_dir() call. As a result of this change, glob() can no longer
      raise OSError.
    - gh-77102: site module now parses .pth file with UTF-8 first, and
      locale encoding if UnicodeDecodeError happened. It supported
      only locale encoding before.
    - gh-76785: We’ve exposed the low-level _interpreters module for
      the sake of the PyPI implementation of PEP 734. It was sometimes
      available as the _xxsubinterpreters module and was formerly used
      only for testing. For the most part, it should be considered an
      internal module, like _thread and _imp. See
      https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-stdlib/41147/26.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by not scanning
      directories for non-wildcard pattern segments.
    - gh-117727: Speed up pathlib.Path.iterdir() by using os.scandir()
      internally.
    - gh-117586: Speed up pathlib.Path.walk() by working with strings
      internally.
    - gh-117722: Change the new multi-separator support in
      asyncio.Stream.readuntil() to only accept tuples of separators
      rather than arbitrary iterables.
    - gh-117692: Fixes a bug when doctest.DocTestFinder was failing on
      wrapped builtin_function_or_method.
    - gh-117348: Largely restored import time performance of
      configparser by avoiding dataclasses.
    - gh-117663: Fix _simple_enum to detect aliases when multiple
      arguments are present but only one is the member value.
    - gh-117618: Support package.module as filename for break command
      of pdb
    - gh-102247: the status codes enum with constants in
      http.HTTPStatus are updated to include the names from RFC9110.
      This RFC includes some HTTP statuses previously only used for
      WEBDAV and assigns more generic names to them.
    - The old constants are preserved for backwards compatibility.
    - gh-117586: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by working with strings
      internally.
    - gh-117225: Add colour to doctest output. Patch by Hugo van
      Kemenade.
    - gh-117566: ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_loopback() will now return
      True for IPv4-mapped loopback addresses, i.e. addresses in the
      ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104 address space.
    - gh-117546: Fix issue where os.path.realpath() stopped resolving
      symlinks after encountering a symlink loop on POSIX.
    - gh-116720: Improved behavior of asyncio.TaskGroup when an
      external cancellation collides with an internal cancellation.
      For example, when two task groups are nested and both experience
      an exception in a child task simultaneously, it was possible
      that the outer task group would misbehave, because its internal
      cancellation was swallowed by the inner task group.
    - In the case where a task group is cancelled externally and also
      must raise an ExceptionGroup, it will now call the parent task’s
      cancel() method. This ensures that a asyncio.CancelledError will
      be raised at the next await, so the cancellation is not lost.
    - An added benefit of these changes is that task groups now
      preserve the cancellation count (asyncio.Task.cancelling()).
    - In order to handle some corner cases, asyncio.Task.uncancel()
      may now reset the undocumented _must_cancel flag when the
      cancellation count reaches zero.
    - gh-117516: Add typing.TypeIs, implementing PEP 742. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-117503: Fix support of non-ASCII user names in bytes paths in
      os.path.expanduser() on Posix.
    - gh-117394: os.path.ismount() is now 2-3 times faster if the user
      has permissions.
    - gh-117313: Only treat '\n', '\r' and '\r\n' as line separators
      in re-folding the email messages. Preserve control characters
      '\v', '\f', '\x1c', '\x1d' and '\x1e' and Unicode line
      separators '\x85', '\u2028' and '\u2029' as is.
    - gh-117142: Convert _ctypes to multi-phase initialisation (PEP
      489).
    - gh-66543: Add the mimetypes.guess_file_type() function which
      works with file path. Passing file path instead of URL in
      guess_type() is soft deprecated.
    - gh-68583: webbrowser CLI: replace getopt with argparse, add long
      options. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-116871: Name suggestions for AttributeError and ImportError
      now only include underscored names if the original name was
      underscored.
    - gh-116023: Don’t show empty fields (value None or []) in
      ast.dump() by default. Add show_empty=False parameter to
      optionally show them.
    - gh-115961: Added name and mode attributes for compressed and
      archived file-like objects in modules bz2, lzma, tarfile and
      zipfile. The value of the mode attribute of gzip.GzipFile was
      changed from integer (1 or 2) to string ('rb' or 'wb'). The
      value of the mode attribute of the readable file-like object
      returned by zipfile.ZipFile.open() was changed from 'r' to 'rb'.
    - gh-82062: Fix inspect.signature() to correctly handle parameter
      defaults on methods in extension modules that use names defined
      in the module namespace.
    - gh-83856: Honor atexit for all multiprocessing start methods
    - gh-113081: Print colorized exception just like built-in
      traceback in pdb
    - gh-112855: Speed up pickling of pathlib.PurePath objects. Patch
      by Barney Gale.
    - gh-111744: Support opcode events in bdb
    - gh-109617: ncurses: fixed a crash that could occur on macOS 13
      or earlier when Python was built with Apple Xcode 15’s SDK.
    - gh-83151: Enabled arbitrary statements and evaluations in pdb
      shell to access the local variables of the current frame, which
      made it possible for multi-scope code like generators or nested
      function to work.
    - gh-110209: Add __class_getitem__() to types.GeneratorType and
      types.CoroutineType for type hinting purposes. Patch by James
      Hilton-Balfe.
    - gh-108191: The types.SimpleNamespace now accepts an optional
      positional argument which specifies initial values of attributes
      as a dict or an iterable of key-value pairs.
    - gh-62090: Fix assertion errors caused by whitespace in metavars
      or SUPPRESS-ed groups in argparse by simplifying usage
      formatting. Patch by Ali Hamdan.
    - gh-102402: Adjust logging.LogRecord to use time.time_ns() and
      fix minor bug related to floating point math.
    - gh-100242: Bring pure Python implementation
      functools.partial.__new__ more in line with the C-implementation
      by not just always checking for the presence of the attribute
      'func' on the first argument of partial. Instead, both the
      Python version and the C version perform an isinstance(func,
      partial) check on the first argument of partial.
    - gh-99730: HEAD requests are no longer upgraded to GET request
      during redirects in urllib.
    - gh-66410: Callbacks registered in the tkinter module now take
      arguments as various Python objects (int, float, bytes, tuple),
      not just str. To restore the previous behavior set tkinter
      module global wantobject to 1 before creating the Tk object or
      call the wantobject() method of the Tk object with argument 1.
      Calling it with argument 2 restores the current default
      behavior.
    - bpo-40943: Fix several IndexError when parse emails with
      truncated Message-ID, address, routes, etc, e.g. example@.
    - bpo-39324: Add mime type mapping for .md <-> text/markdown
    - bpo-18108: shutil.chown() now supports dir_fd and
      follow_symlinks keyword arguments.
    - bpo-30988: Fix parsing of emails with invalid address headers
      having a leading or trailing dot. Patch by tsufeki.
    - bpo-32839: Add the after_info() method for Tkinter widgets.
  - Documentation
    - gh-117928: The minimum Sphinx version required for the
      documentation is now 6.2.1.
  - Build
    - gh-118734: Fixes Windows build when invoked directly (not
      through the build.bat script) without specifying a value for
      UseTIER2.
    - gh-115119: The configure option --with-system-libmpdec now
      defaults to yes. The bundled copy of libmpdecimal will be
      removed in Python 3.15.
    - gh-117845: Fix building against recent libedit versions by
      detecting readline hook signatures in configure.
    - gh-116622: A testbed project was added to run the test suite on
      Android.
    - gh-117645: Increase WASI stack size from 512 KiB to 8 MiB and
      the initial memory from 10 MiB to 20 MiB. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-115119: configure now uses pkg-config to detect decimal
      dependencies if the --with-system-libmpdec option is given.
  - Windows
    - gh-115119: Update Windows installer to use libmpdecimal 4.0.0.
    - gh-118486: os.mkdir() now accepts mode of 0o700 to restrict the
      new directory to the current user.
    - gh-118347: Fixes launcher updates not being installed.
    - gh-118293: The multiprocessing module now passes the
      STARTF_FORCEOFFFEEDBACK flag when spawning processes to tell
      Windows not to change the mouse cursor.
    - gh-115009: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.45.3.
    - gh-90329: Suppress the warning displayed on virtual environment
      creation when the requested and created paths differ only by a
      short (8.3 style) name. Warnings will continue to be shown if a
      junction or symlink in the path caused the venv to be created in
      a different location than originally requested.
    - gh-117786: Fixes virtual environments not correctly launching
      when created from a Store install.
  - macOS
    - gh-115119: Update macOS installer to use libmpdecimal 4.0.0.
    - gh-114099: iOS preprocessor symbol usage was made compatible

    - gh-110850: Add “Raw” variant of PyTime functions
        PyTime_MonotonicRaw()
        PyTime_PerfCounterRaw()
        PyTime_TimeRaw()
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117987: Restore functions removed in Python 3.13 alpha 1:
        Py_SetPythonHome()
        Py_SetProgramName()
        PySys_SetArgvEx()
        PySys_SetArgv()
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117929: Restore removed PyEval_InitThreads() function. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117534: Improve validation logic in the C implementation of
      datetime.datetime.fromisoformat() to better handle invalid
      years. Patch by Vlad Efanov.
    - gh-68114: Fixed skipitem()’s handling of the old ‘w’ and ‘w#’
      formatters. These are no longer supported and now raise an
      exception if used.
    - gh-111997: Add a C-API for firing monitoring events.

- Python 3.13.0 alpha 6:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-117648: Improve performance of os.path.join() and
      os.path.expanduser().
    - gh-117584: Raise TypeError for non-paths in posixpath.relpath().
    - gh-117494: Refactored the instruction sequence data structure
      out of compile.c into instruction_sequence.c.
    - gh-116968: Introduce a unified 16-bit backoff counter type
      (_Py_BackoffCounter), shared between the Tier 1 adaptive
      specializer and the Tier 2 optimizer. The API used for adaptive
      specialization counters is changed but the behavior is (supposed
      to be) identical.
    - The behavior of the Tier 2 counters is changed:
        There are no longer dynamic thresholds (we never varied these).
        All counters now use the same exponential backoff.
        The counter for JUMP_BACKWARD starts counting down from 16.
        The temperature in side exits starts counting down from 64.
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following bytes and
      bytearray methods by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling
      convention:
        endswith()
        startswith()
    - gh-117431: Improve the performance of the following str methods
      by adapting them to the METH_FASTCALL calling convention:
        count()
        endswith()
        find()
        index()
        rfind()
        rindex()
        startswith()
    - gh-117411: Move PyFutureFeatures to an internal header and make
      it private.
    - gh-109120: Added handle of incorrect star expressions, e.g f(3,
      *). Patch by Grigoryev Semyon
    - gh-117381: Fix error message for ntpath.commonpath().
    - gh-117349: Optimise several functions in os.path.
    - gh-117335: Raise TypeError for non-sequences for
      ntpath.commonpath().
    - gh-117266: Fix crashes for certain user-created subclasses of
      ast.AST. Such classes are now expected to set the _field_types
      attribute.
    - gh-99108: Updated the hashlib built-in HACL* project C code from
      upstream that we use for many implementations when they are not
      present via OpenSSL in a given build. This also avoids the rare
      potential for a C symbol name one definition rule linking issue.
    - gh-117108: Change the old space bit of objects in the young
      generation from 0 to gcstate->visited, so that any objects
      created during GC will have the old bit set correctly if they
      get moved into the old generation.
    - gh-117108: The cycle GC now chooses the size of increments based
      on the total heap size, instead of the rate of object creation.
      This ensures that it can keep up with growing heaps.
    - gh-117114: Make os.path.isdevdrive() available on all platforms.
      For those that do not offer Dev Drives, it will always return
      False.
    - gh-116735: For INSTRUMENTED_CALL_FUNCTION_EX, set arg0 to
      sys.monitoring.MISSING instead of None for CALL event.
    - gh-113964: Starting new threads and process creation through
      os.fork() are now only prevented once all non-daemon threads
      exit.
    - gh-116626: Ensure INSTRUMENTED_CALL_FUNCTION_EX always emits
      CALL
    - gh-116554: list.sort() now exploits more cases of partial
      ordering, particularly those with long descending runs with
      sub-runs of equal values. Those are recognized as single runs
      now (previously, each block of repeated values caused a new run
      to be created).
    - gh-114099: Added a Loader that can discover extension modules in
      an iOS-style Frameworks folder.
    - gh-115775: Compiler populates the new __static_attributes__
      field on a class with the names of attributes of this class
      which are accessed through self.X from any function in its body.
    - gh-115776: The array of values, the PyDictValues struct is now
      embedded in the object during allocation. This provides better
      performance in the common case, and does not degrade as much
      when the object’s __dict__ is materialized.
    - gh-108362: Implement an incremental cyclic garbage collector. By
      collecting the old generation in increments, there is no need
      for a full heap scan. This can hugely reduce maximum pause time
      for programs with large heaps.
    - Reduce the number of generations from three to two. The old
      generation is split into two spaces, “visited” and “pending”.
    - Collection happens in two steps:: * An increment is formed from
      the young generation and a small part of the pending space. *
      This increment is scanned and the survivors moved to the end of
      the visited space.
    - When the collecting space becomes empty, the two spaces are
      swapped.
    - gh-109870: Dataclasses now calls exec() once per dataclass,
      instead of once per method being added. This can speed up
      dataclass creation by up to 20%.
    - gh-97901: Mime type text/rtf is now supported by mimetypes.
    - bpo-24612: Improve the SyntaxError that happens when ‘not’
      appears after an operator. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Library
    - gh-117467: Preserve mailbox ownership when rewriting in
      mailbox.mbox.flush(). Patch by Tony Mountifield.
    - gh-114848: Raise FileNotFoundError when getcwd() returns
      ‘(unreachable)’, which can happen on Linux >= 2.6.36 with glibc
      < 2.27.
    - gh-117459: asyncio.asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() now keeps
      the traceback of CancelledError, TimeoutError and
      InvalidStateError which are raised in the coroutine.
    - gh-117337: Deprecate undocumented glob.glob0() and glob.glob1()
      functions. Use glob.glob() and pass a directory to its root_dir
      argument instead.
    - gh-117348: Refactored configparser.RawConfigParser._read() to
      reduce cyclometric complexity and improve comprehensibility.
    - gh-66449: configparser.ConfigParser now accepts unnamed sections
      before named ones, if configured to do so.
    - gh-88014: In documentation of gzip.GzipFile in module gzip,
      explain data type of optional constructor argument mtime, and
      recommend mtime = 0 for generating deterministic streams.
    - gh-117310: Fixed an unlikely early & extra Py_DECREF triggered
      crash in ssl when creating a new _ssl._SSLContext if CPython was
      built implausibly such that the default cipher list is empty or
      the SSL library it was linked against reports a failure from its
      C SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list() API.
    - gh-117294: A DocTestCase now reports as skipped if all examples
      in the doctest are skipped.
    - gh-98966: In subprocess, raise a more informative message when
      stdout=STDOUT.
    - gh-117225: doctest: only print “and X failed” when non-zero,
      don’t pluralise “1 items”. Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
    - gh-117205: Speed up compileall.compile_dir() by 20% when using
      multiprocessing by increasing chunksize.
    - gh-117178: Fix regression in lazy loading of self-referential
      modules, introduced in gh-114781.
    - gh-112383: Fix dis module’s handling of ENTER_EXECUTOR
      instructions.
    - gh-117182: Lazy-loading of modules that modify their own
      __class__ no longer reverts the __class__ to types.ModuleType.
    - gh-117084: Fix zipfile extraction for directory entries with the
      name containing backslashes on Windows.
    - gh-117110: Fix a bug that prevents subclasses of typing.Any to
      be instantiated with arguments. Patch by Chris Fu.
    - gh-109653: Deferred select imports in importlib.metadata and
      importlib.resources for a 14% speedup.
    - gh-70647: Start the deprecation period for the current behavior
      of datetime.datetime.strptime() and time.strptime() which always
      fails to parse a date string with a ValueError involving a day
      of month such as strptime("02-29", "%m-%d") when a year is not
      specified and the date happen to be February 29th. This should
      help avoid users finding new bugs every four years due to a
      natural mistaken assumption about the API when parsing partial
      date values.
    - gh-116987: Fixed inspect.findsource() for class code objects.
    - gh-114099: Modify standard library to allow for iOS platform
      differences.
    - gh-90872: On Windows, subprocess.Popen.wait() no longer calls
      WaitForSingleObject() with a negative timeout: pass 0 ms if the
      timeout is negative. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116957: configparser: Don’t leave ConfigParser values in an
      invalid state (stored as a list instead of a str) after an
      earlier read raised DuplicateSectionError or
      DuplicateOptionError.
    - gh-115538: _io.WindowsConsoleIO now emit a warning if a boolean
      value is passed as a filedescriptor argument.
    - gh-90095: Ignore empty lines and comments in .pdbrc
    - gh-106531: Refreshed zipfile._path from zipp 3.18, providing
      better compatibility for PyPy, better glob performance for
      deeply nested zipfiles, and providing internal access to
      CompleteDirs.inject for use in other tests (like
      importlib.resources).
    - gh-63207: On Windows, time.time() now uses the
      GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime() clock to have a resolution
      better than 1 us, instead of the GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() clock
      which has a resolution of 15.6 ms. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116764: Restore support of None and other false values in
      urllib.parse functions parse_qs() and parse_qsl(). Also, they
      now raise a TypeError for non-zero integers and non-empty
      sequences.
    - gh-116811: In PathFinder.invalidate_caches, delegate to
      MetadataPathFinder.invalidate_caches.
    - gh-116647: Fix recursive child in dataclasses
    - gh-113171: Fixed various false positives and false negatives in
        ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private (see these docs for details)
        ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global
        ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_private
        ipaddress.IPv6Address.is_global
    - Also in the corresponding ipaddress.IPv4Network and
      ipaddress.IPv6Network attributes.
    - gh-63283: In encodings.idna, any capitalization of the the ACE
      prefix (xn--) is now acceptable. Patch by Pepijn de Vos and
      Zackery Spytz.
    - gh-71042: Add platform.android_ver(), which provides device and
      OS information on Android.
    - gh-73468: Added new math.fma() function, wrapping C99’s fma()
      operation: fused multiply-add function. Patch by Mark Dickinson
      and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116608: The importlib.resources functions is_resource(),
      open_binary(), open_text(), path(), read_binary(), and
      read_text() are un-deprecated, and support subdirectories via
      multiple positional arguments. The contents() function also
      allows subdirectories, but remains deprecated.
    - gh-116484: Change automatically generated tkinter.Checkbutton
      widget names to avoid collisions with automatically generated
      tkinter.ttk.Checkbutton widget names within the same parent
      widget.
    - gh-114314: In ctypes, ctype data is now stored in type objects
      directly rather than in a dict subclass. This is an internal
      change that should not affect usage.
    - gh-116401: Fix blocking os.fwalk() and shutil.rmtree() on
      opening named pipe.
    - gh-71052: Implement ctypes.util.find_library() on Android.
    - gh-90535: Fix support of interval values > 1 in
      logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler for when='MIDNIGHT' and
      when='Wx'.
    - gh-113308: Remove some internal protected parts from uuid:
      _has_uuid_generate_time_safe, _netbios_getnode,
      _ipconfig_getnode, and _load_system_functions. They were unused.
    - gh-115627: Fix the ssl module error handling of connection
      terminate by peer. It now throws an OSError with the appropriate
      error code instead of an EOFError.
    - gh-114847: Speed up os.path.realpath() on non-Windows platforms.
    - gh-114271: Fix a race in threading.Thread.join().
    - threading._MainThread now always represents the main thread of
      the main interpreter.
    - PyThreadState.on_delete and PyThreadState.on_delete_data have
      been removed.
    - gh-113538: Add asyncio.Server.close_clients() and
      asyncio.Server.abort_clients() methods which allow to more
      forcefully close an asyncio server.
    - gh-85287: Changes Unicode codecs to return UnicodeEncodeError or
      UnicodeDecodeError, rather than just UnicodeError.
    - gh-113548: pdb now allows CLI arguments to pdb -m.
    - gh-112948: Make completion of pdb similar to Python REPL
    - gh-105866: Fixed _get_slots bug which caused error when defining
      dataclasses with slots and a weakref_slot.
    - gh-96471: Add asyncio.Queue termination with shutdown() method.
    - gh-89739: The zipimport module can now read ZIP64 files.
    - bpo-33533: asyncio.as_completed() now returns an object that is
      both an asynchronous iterator and plain iterator. The new
      asynchronous iteration pattern allows for easier correlation
      between prior tasks and their completed results. This is a
      closer match to concurrent.futures.as_completed()’s iteration
      pattern. Patch by Justin Arthur.
    - bpo-27578: inspect.getsource() (and related functions) work with
      empty module files, returning '\n' (or reasonable equivalent)
      instead of raising OSError. Patch by Kernc.
    - bpo-37141: Accept an iterable of separators in
      asyncio.StreamReader.readuntil(), stopping when one of them is
      encountered.
    - gh-66543: Make mimetypes.guess_type() properly parsing of URLs
      with only a host name, URLs containing fragment or query, and
      filenames with only a UNC sharepoint on Windows. Based on patch
      by Dong-hee Na.
    - bpo-15010: unittest.TestLoader.discover() now saves the original
      value of unittest.TestLoader._top_level_dir and restores it at
      the end of the call.
  - Documentation
    - gh-115977: Remove compatibilty references to Emscripten.
    - gh-114099: Add an iOS platform guide, and flag modules not
      available on iOS.
    - gh-91565: Changes to documentation files and config outputs to
      reflect the new location for reporting bugs - i.e. GitHub rather
      than bugs.python.org.
  - Tests
    - gh-83434: Disable JUnit XML output (--junit-xml=FILE command
      line option) in regrtest when hunting for reference leaks (-R
      option). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-117187: Fix XML tests for vanilla Expat <2.6.0.
    - gh-116333: Tests of TLS related things (error codes, etc) were
      updated to be more lenient about specific error message strings
      and behaviors as seen in the BoringSSL and AWS-LC forks of
      OpenSSL.
    - gh-117089: Consolidated tests for importlib.metadata in their
      own metadata package.
    - gh-115979: Update test_importlib so that it passes under WASI
      SDK 21.
    - gh-112536: Add –tsan to test.regrtest for running TSAN tests in
      reasonable execution times. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - gh-116307: Added import helper isolated_modules as CleanImport
      does not remove modules imported during the context. Use it in
      importlib.resources tests to avoid leaving mod around to impede
      importlib.metadata tests.
  - Build
    - gh-114736: Have WASI builds use WASI SDK 21.
    - gh-115983: Skip building test modules that must be built as
      shared under WASI.
    - gh-71052: Add Android build script and instructions.
  - Windows
    - gh-117267: Ensure DirEntry.stat().st_ctime behaves consistently
      with os.stat() during the deprecation period of st_ctime by
      containing the same value as st_birthtime. After the deprecation
      period, st_ctime will be the metadata change time (or
      unavailable through DirEntry), and only st_birthtime will
      contain the creation time.
    - gh-116195: Improves performance of os.getppid() by using an
      alternate system API when available. Contributed by vxiiduu.
    - gh-88494: On Windows, time.monotonic() now uses the
      QueryPerformanceCounter() clock to have a resolution better than
      1 us, instead of the GetTickCount64() clock which has a
      resolution of 15.6 ms. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116773: Fix instances of <_overlapped.Overlapped object at
      0xXXX> still has pending operation at deallocation, the process
      may crash.
    - gh-91227: Fix the asyncio ProactorEventLoop implementation so
      that sending a datagram to an address that is not listening does
      not prevent receiving any more datagrams.
    - gh-115119: Switched from vendored libmpdecimal code to a
      separately-hosted external package in the cpython-source-deps
      repository when building the _decimal module.
  - C API
    - gh-117642: Fix PEP 737 implementation for %#T and %#N.
    - gh-87193: _PyBytes_Resize() can now be called for bytes objects
      with reference count > 1, including 1-byte bytes objects. It
      creates a new bytes object and destroys the old one if it has
      reference count > 1.
    - gh-117021: Fix integer overflow in PyLong_AsPid() on non-Windows
      64-bit platforms.
    - gh-115756: PyCode_GetFirstFree() is an ustable API now and has
      been renamed to PyUnstable_Code_GetFirstFree(). (Contributed by
      Bogdan Romanyuk in gh-115781)
    - gh-116869: Add test_cext test: build a C extension to check if
      the Python C API emits C compiler warnings. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-116869: Make the C API compatible with
      -Werror=declaration-after-statement compiler flag again. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116936: Add PyType_GetModuleByDef() to the limited C API.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-116809: Restore removed private _PyErr_ChainExceptions1()
      function. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-115754: In the limited C API version 3.13, getting Py_None,
      Py_False, Py_True, Py_Ellipsis and Py_NotImplemented singletons
      is now implemented as function calls at the stable ABI level to
      hide implementation details. Getting these constants still
      return borrowed references. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-115754: Add Py_GetConstant() and Py_GetConstantBorrowed()
      functions to get constants. For example,
      Py_GetConstant(Py_CONSTANT_ZERO) returns a strong reference to
      the constant zero. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-111696: Add support for %T, %T#, %N and %N# formats to
      PyUnicode_FromFormat(): format the fully qualified name of an
      object type and of a type: call PyType_GetModuleName(). See PEP
      737 for more information. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-111696: Add PyType_GetModuleName() function to get the type’s
      module name. Equivalent to getting the type.__module__
      attribute. Patch by Eric Snow and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-111696: Add PyType_GetFullyQualifiedName() function to get
      the type’s fully qualified name. Equivalent to
      f"{type.__module__}.{type.__qualname__}", or type.__qualname__
      if type.__module__ is not a string or is equal to "builtins".
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-85283: The fcntl, grp, pwd, termios, _statistics and
      _testconsole C extensions are now built with the limited C API.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-111140: Add additional flags to PyLong_AsNativeBytes() and
      PyLong_FromNativeBytes() to allow the caller to determine how to
      handle edge cases around values that fill the entire buffer.
    - gh-113024: Add PyObject_GenericHash() function.

- Update to 3.13.0a5:
  - Security
    - gh-115398: Allow controlling Expat >=2.6.0 reparse deferral
      (CVE-2023-52425) by adding five new methods:
        xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser.flush()
        xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLPullParser.flush()
        xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.GetReparseDeferralEnabled()
        xml.parsers.expat.xmlparser.SetReparseDeferralEnabled()
        xml.sax.expatreader.ExpatParser.flush()
    - gh-114572: ssl.SSLContext.cert_store_stats() and
      ssl.SSLContext.get_ca_certs() now correctly lock access to
      the certificate store, when the ssl.SSLContext is shared
      across multiple threads.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-116604: Respect the status of the garbage collector when
      indirect calls are made via PyErr_CheckSignals() and the

      sequences. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-115778: Add tierN annotation for instruction definition
      in interpreter DSL.
    - gh-115733: Fix crash when calling next() on exhausted list

    - gh-115700: The regen-cases build stage now works on
      Windows.
    - gh-115347: Fix bug where docstring was replaced by a
      redundant NOP when Python is run with -OO.
    - gh-115323: Make error message more meaningful for when
      bytearray.extend() is called with a str object.
    - gh-112175: Every PyThreadState now has its own
      eval_breaker, allowing specific threads to be interrupted.
    - gh-115154: Fix a bug that was causing the
      tokenize.untokenize() function to handle unicode named
      literals incorrectly. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112433: Add ability to force alignment of
      ctypes.Structure by way of the new _align_ attribute on the
      class.
    - gh-104090: The multiprocessing resource tracker now
      exits with non-zero status code if a resource leak was
      detected. It still exits with status code 0 otherwise.
    - gh-105858: Improve the constructors for ast
      nodes. Arguments of list types now default to an empty list
      if omitted, and optional fields default to None. AST nodes
      now have an __annotations__ attribute with the expected
      types of their attributes. Passing unrecognized extra
      arguments to AST nodes is deprecated and will become an
      error in Python 3.15. Omitting a required argument to an
      AST node is deprecated and will become an error in Python
      3.15. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-101860: Expose __name__ attribute on property.
    - gh-96497: Fix incorrect resolution of mangled class
      variables used in assignment expressions in comprehensions.
  - Library
    - gh-116600: Fix repr() for global Flag members.
    - gh-116349: platform.java_ver() is deprecated and will be
      removed in 3.15. It was largely untested, had a confusing
      API, and was only useful for Jython support.
    - gh-116143: Fix a race in pydoc _start_server, eliminating a
      window in which _start_server can return a thread that is
      “serving” but without a docserver set.
    - gh-116127: typing: implement PEP 705 which adds
      typing.ReadOnly support to typing.TypedDict.
    - gh-116325: typing: raise SyntaxError instead of
      AttributeError on forward references as empty strings.
    - gh-115957: When asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task is called on
      an inactive asyncio.TaskGroup, the given coroutine will be
      closed (which prevents a RuntimeWarning).
    - gh-115978: Disable preadv(), readv(), pwritev(),
      and writev() on WASI. Under wasmtime for WASI
      0.2, these functions don’t pass test_posix
      (gh-bytecodealliance/wasmtime#7830).
    - gh-88352: Fix the computation of the next rollover
      time in the logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler handler.
      computeRollover() now always returns a timestamp larger
      than the specified time and works correctly during the DST
      change. doRollover() no longer overwrite the already rolled
      over file, saving from data loss when run at midnight or
      during repeated time at the DST change.
    - gh-87115: Set __main__.__spec__ to None when running a
      script with pdb
    - gh-76511: Fix UnicodeEncodeError in
      email.Message.as_string() that results when a message
      that claims to be in the ascii character set actually has
      non-ascii characters. Non-ascii characters are now replaced
      with the U+FFFD replacement character, like in the replace
      error handler.
    - gh-89547: Add support for nested typing special forms like
      Final[ClassVar[int]].
    - gh-65824: Improve the less prompt in pydoc.
    - gh-116040: [Enum] fix by-value calls when second value is
      falsey; e.g. Cardinal(1, 0)
    - gh-115821: [Enum] Improve error message when calling
      super().__new__() in custom __new__.
    - gh-85644: Use the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variable
      in webbrowser to check desktop. Prefer it to the deprecated
      GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID for GNOME detection.
    - gh-75988: Fixed unittest.mock.create_autospec() to pass
      the call through to the wrapped object to return the real
      result.
    - gh-115881: Fix issue where ast.parse() would incorrectly
      flag conditional context managers (such as with (x() if y
      else z()): ...) as invalid syntax if feature_version=(3,
      8) was passed. This reverts changes to the grammar made as
      part of gh-94949.
    - gh-115886: Fix silent truncation of the
      name with an embedded null character in
      multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory.
    - gh-115532: Add kernel density estimation to the statistics
      module.
    - gh-115714: On WASI, the time module no longer get process
      time using times() or CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, system API
      is that is unreliable and is likely to be removed from
      WASI. The affected clock functions fall back to calling
      clock().
    - gh-115809: Improve algorithm for computing
      which rolled-over log files to delete in
      logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler. It is now reliable for
      handlers without namer and with arbitrary deterministic
      namer that leaves the datetime part in the file name
      unmodified.
    - gh-74668: urllib.parse functions parse_qs() and
      parse_qsl() now support bytes arguments containing raw and
      percent-encoded non-ASCII data.
    - gh-67044: csv.writer() now always quotes or escapes '\r'
      and '\n', regardless of lineterminator value.
    - gh-115712: Restore support of space delimiter with
      skipinitialspace=True in csv. csv.writer() now quotes empty
      fields if delimiter is a space and skipinitialspace is true
      and raises exception if quoting is not possible.
    - gh-112364: Fixed ast.unparse() to handle format_spec with
      ", ' or \\. Patched by Frank Hoffmann.
    - gh-112997: Stop logging potentially sensitive callback
      arguments in asyncio unless debug mode is active.
    - gh-114914: Fix an issue where an abandoned StreamWriter
      would not be garbage collected.
    - gh-111358: Fix a bug in
      asyncio.BaseEventLoop.shutdown_default_executor() to ensure
      the timeout passed to the coroutine behaves as expected.
    - gh-115618: Fix improper decreasing the reference count for
      None argument in property methods getter(), setter() and
      deleter().
    - gh-112720: Refactor dis.ArgResolver to make it possible to
      subclass and change the way jump args are interpreted.
    - gh-112006: Fix inspect.unwrap() for types
      with the __wrapper__ data descriptor. Fix
      inspect.Signature.from_callable() for builtins
      classmethod() and staticmethod().
    - gh-101293: Support callables with the __call__() method
      and types with __new__() and __init__() methods set to
      class methods, static methods, bound methods, partial
      functions, and other types of methods and descriptors in
      inspect.Signature.from_callable().
    - gh-103092: Isolate _lsprof (apply PEP 687).
    - gh-113942: pydoc no longer skips global functions
      implemented as builtin methods, such as
      MethodDescriptorType and WrapperDescriptorType.
    - gh-115256: Added DeprecationWarning when accessing the
      tarfile attribute of TarInfo objects. The attribute is
      never used internally and is only attached to TarInfos when
      the tarfile is opened in write-mode, not read-mode. The
      attribute creates an unnecessary reference cycle which may
      cause corruption when not closing the handle after writing
      a tarfile.
    - gh-115197: urllib.request no longer resolves the hostname
      before checking it against the system’s proxy bypass list
      on macOS and Windows.
    - gh-113812: DatagramTransport.sendto() will now send
      zero-length datagrams if called with an empty bytes
      object. The transport flow control also now accounts for
      the datagram header when calculating the buffer size.
    - gh-114763: Protect modules loaded with
      importlib.util.LazyLoader from race conditions when
      multiple threads try to access attributes before the
      loading is complete.
    - gh-114709: posixpath.commonpath() now raises a ValueError
      exception when passed an empty iterable. Previously,
      IndexError was raised.
      posixpath.commonpath() now raises a TypeError exception
      when passed None. Previously, ValueError was raised.
    - gh-114610: Fix bug where pathlib.PurePath.with_stem()
      converted a non-empty path suffix to a stem when given an
      empty stem argument. It now raises ValueError, just like
      pathlib.PurePath.with_suffix() does when called on a path
      with an empty stem, given a non-empty suffix argument.
    - gh-107361: Add ssl.VERIFY_X509_PARTIAL_CHAIN and
      VERIFY_X509_STRICT to the default SSL context created with
      ssl.create_default_context().
    - gh-112281: Allow creating union of types for
      typing.Annotated with unhashable metadata.
    - gh-111775: Fix
      importlib.resources.simple.ResourceHandle.open() for text
      mode, added missed stream argument.
    - gh-90095: Make .pdbrc and -c work with any valid pdb
      commands.
    - gh-107625: Raise configparser.ParsingError from read()
      and read_file() methods of configparser.ConfigParser if a
      key without a corresponding value is continued (that is,
      followed by an indented line).
    - gh-107155: Fix incorrect output of help(x) where x is a
      lambda function, which has an __annotations__ dictionary
      attribute with a "return" key.
    - gh-57141: Add option for non-shallow comparisons to
      filecmp.dircmp like filecmp.cmp(). Original patch by Steven
      Ward. Enhanced by Tobias Rautenkranz
    - gh-69990: Profile.print_stats() has been improved to accept
      multiple sort arguments. Patched by Chiu-Hsiang Hsu and
      Furkan Onder.
    - gh-104061: Add socket.SO_BINDTOIFINDEX constant.
    - gh-60346: Fix ArgumentParser inconsistent with
      parse_known_args.
    - gh-102389: Add windows_31j to aliases for cp932 codec
    - gh-72249: functools.partial`s of :func:`repr() has been
      improved to include the module name. Patched by Furkan
      Onder and Anilyka Barry.
    - gh-100985: Update HTTPSConnection to consistently wrap IPv6
      Addresses when using a proxy.
    - gh-100884: email: fix misfolding of comma in address-lists
      over multiple lines in combination with unicode encoding.
    - gh-95782: Fix io.BufferedReader.tell(),
      io.BufferedReader.seek(), _pyio.BufferedReader.tell(),
      io.BufferedRandom.tell(), io.BufferedRandom.seek() and
      _pyio.BufferedRandom.tell() being able to return negative
      offsets.
    - gh-96310: Fix a traceback in argparse when all options in a
      mutually exclusive group are suppressed.
    - gh-93205: Fixed a bug in
      logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler where multiple
      rotating handler instances pointing to files with the same
      name but different extensions would conflict and not delete
      the correct files.
    - bpo-31116: Add Z85 encoding to base64.
    - bpo-44865: Add missing call to localization function in
      argparse.
    - bpo-43952: Fix multiprocessing.connection.Listener.accept()
      to accept empty bytes as authkey. Not accepting empty bytes
      as key causes it to hang indefinitely.
    - bpo-42125: linecache: get module name from __spec__ if
      available. This allows getting source code for the __main__
      module when a custom loader is used.
    - bpo-41122: Failing to pass arguments properly to
      functools.singledispatchmethod() now throws a TypeError
      instead of hitting an index out of bounds internally.
    - bpo-40818: The asyncio REPL now runs
      sys.__interactivehook__ on startup. The default
      implementation of sys.__interactivehook__ provides
      auto-completion to the asyncio REPL. Patch contributed by
      Rémi Lapeyre.
    - bpo-33775: Add ‘default’ and ‘version’ help text for
      localization in argparse.
  - Documentation
    - gh-115399: Document CVE-2023-52425 of Expat <2.6.0 under
      “XML vulnerabilities”.
    - gh-109653: Improve import time of uuid on Linux.
  - Tests
    - gh-71052: Add test exclusions to support running the test
      suite on Android.
    - gh-71052: Enable test_concurrent_futures on platforms that
      support threading but not multiprocessing.
    - gh-115796: Make ‘_testinternalcapi.assemble_code_object’
      construct the exception table for the code object.
    - gh-115720: Leak tests (-R, --huntrleaks) now show a summary
      of the number of leaks found in each iteration.
    - gh-115122: Add --bisect option to regrtest test runner:
      run failed tests with test.bisect_cmd to identify failing
      tests. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-115596: Fix ProgramPriorityTests in test_os permanently
      changing the process priority.
    - gh-115556: On Windows, commas passed in arguments to
      Tools\buildbot\test.bat and PCbuild\\rt.bat are now
      properly handled.
    - gh-115420: Fix translation of exception hander targets by
      _testinternalcapi.optimize_cfg.
    - gh-115376: Fix segfault in
      _testinternalcapi.compiler_codegen on bad input.

      when the deque is concurrently modified.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-112087: For an empty reverse iterator for list will be
      reduced to reversed(). Patch by Donghee Na
    - gh-114570: Add PythonFinalizationError exception. This exception
      derived from RuntimeError is raised when an operation is blocked
      during the Python finalization. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-114695: Add sys._clear_internal_caches(), which clears all
      internal performance-related caches (and deprecate the
      less-general sys._clear_type_cache() function).
    - gh-114828: Fix compilation crashes in uncommon code examples
      using super() inside a comprehension in a class body.
    - gh-112069: Adapt set and frozenset methods to Argument Clinic.
    - gh-115011: Setters for members with an unsigned integer type now
      support the same range of valid values for objects that has a
      __index__() method as for int.
    - gh-114887: Changed socket type validation in
      create_datagram_endpoint() to accept all non-stream sockets.
      This fixes a regression in compatibility with raw sockets.
    - gh-114944: Fixes a race between PyParkingLot_Park and
      _PyParkingLot_UnparkAll.
    - gh-113462: Limit the number of versions that a single class can
      use. Prevents a few wayward classes using up all the version
      numbers.
    - gh-76763: The chr() builtin function now always raises
      ValueError for values outside the valid range. Previously it
      raised OverflowError for very large or small values.
    - gh-114806: No longer specialize calls to classes, if those
      classes have metaclasses. Fixes bug where the __call__ method of
      the metaclass was not being called.
    - gh-107944: Improve error message for function calls with bad
      keyword arguments via getargs
    - gh-112529: The free-threaded build no longer allocates space for
      the PyGC_Head structure in objects that support cyclic garbage
      collection. A number of other fields and data structures are
      used as replacements, including ob_gc_bits, ob_tid, and mimalloc
      internal data structures.
    - gh-114456: Lower the recursion limit under a debug build of
      WASI.
    - gh-114083: Compiler applies folding of LOAD_CONST with following
      instruction in a separate pass before other optimisations. This
      enables jump threading in certain circumstances.
    - gh-114388: Fix a RuntimeWarning emitted when assign an
      integer-like value that is not an instance of int to an
      attribute that corresponds to a C struct member of type T_UINT
      and T_ULONG. Fix a double RuntimeWarning emitted when assign a
      negative integer value to an attribute that corresponds to a C
      struct member of type T_UINT.
    - gh-114265: Compiler propagates line numbers before optimization,
      leading to more optimization opportunities and removing the need
      for the guarantee_lineno_for_exits hack.
    - gh-112529: The free-threaded build now has its own thread-safe
      GC implementation that uses mimalloc to find GC tracked objects.
      It is non-generational, unlike the existing GC implementation.
    - gh-114050: Fix segmentation fault caused by an incorrect format
      string in TypeError exception when more than two arguments are
      passed to int.
    - gh-112354: The END_FOR instruction now pops only one value. This
      is to better support side exits in loops.
    - gh-113884: Make queue.SimpleQueue thread safe when the GIL is
      disabled.
    - gh-114058: Implement the foundations of the Tier 2 redundancy
      eliminator.
    - gh-113939: frame.clear(): Clear frame.f_locals as well, and not
      only the fast locals. This is relevant once frame.f_locals was
      accessed, which would contain also references to all the locals.
    - gh-112050: Convert collections.deque to use Argument Clinic.
    - gh-112050: Make methods on collections.deque thread-safe when
      the GIL is disabled.
    - gh-113464: Add an option (--enable-experimental-jit for
      configure-based builds or --experimental-jit for PCbuild-based
      ones) to build an experimental just-in-time compiler, based on
      copy-and-patch
    - gh-113055: Make interp->obmalloc a pointer. For interpreters
      that share state with the main interpreter, this points to the
      same static memory structure. For interpreters with their own
      obmalloc state, it is heap allocated. Add free_obmalloc_arenas()
      which will free the obmalloc arenas and radix tree structures
      for interpreters with their own obmalloc state.
    - gh-55664: Add warning when creating type using a namespace
      dictionary with non-string keys. Patched by Daniel Urban and
      Furkan Onder.
    - gh-104530: Use native Win32 condition variables.
  - Library
    - gh-115392: Fix a bug in doctest where incorrect line numbers
      would be reported for decorated functions.
    - gh-114563: Fix several format() bugs when using the C
      implementation of Decimal: * memory leak in some rare cases when
      using the z format option (coerce negative 0) * incorrect output
      when applying the z format option to type F (fixed-point with
      capital NAN / INF) * incorrect output when applying the # format
      option (alternate form)
    - gh-102840: Fix confused traceback when floordiv, mod, or divmod
      operations happens between instances of fractions.Fraction and
      complex.
    - gh-115165: Most exceptions are now ignored when attempting to
      set the __orig_class__ attribute on objects returned when
      calling typing generic aliases (including generic aliases
      created using typing.Annotated). Previously only AttributeError
      was ignored. Patch by Dave Shawley.
    - gh-112903: Fix “issubclass() arg 1 must be a class” errors in
      certain cases of multiple inheritance with generic aliases
      (regression in early 3.13 alpha releases).
    - gh-115133: Fix tests for XMLPullParser with Expat 2.6.0.
    - gh-115059: io.BufferedRandom.read1() now flushes the underlying
      write buffer.
    - gh-79382: Trailing ** no longer allows to match files and
      non-existing paths in recursive glob().
    - gh-67837: Avoid race conditions in the creation of directories
      during concurrent extraction in tarfile and zipfile.
    - gh-115060: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by removing redundant
      regex matching.
    - gh-97928: Partially revert the behavior of tkinter.Text.count().
      By default it preserves the behavior of older Python versions,
      except that setting wantobjects to 0 no longer has effect. Add a
      new parameter return_ints: specifying return_ints=True makes
      Text.count() always returning the single count as an integer
      instead of a 1-tuple or None.
    - gh-114628: When csv.Error is raised when handling TypeError, do
      not print the TypeError traceback.
    - gh-85984: Added _POSIX_VDISABLE from C’s <unistd.h> to termios.
    - gh-114965: Update bundled pip to 24.0
    - gh-114959: tarfile no longer ignores errors when trying to
      extract a directory on top of a file.
    - gh-114894: Add array.array.clear().
    - gh-114071: Support tuple subclasses using auto() for enum member
      value.
    - gh-109475: Fix support of explicit option value “–” in argparse
      (e.g. --option=--).
    - gh-49766: Fix date-datetime comparison. Now the special
      comparison methods like __eq__ and __lt__ return NotImplemented
      if one of comparands is date and other is datetime instead of
      ignoring the time part and the time zone or forcefully return
      “not equal” or raise TypeError. It makes comparison of date and
      datetime subclasses more symmetric and allows to change the
      default behavior by overriding the special comparison methods in
      subclasses.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on Windows ARM64
      platform by setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 32 in stgdict. Patch by
      Diego Russo
    - gh-114678: Ensure that deprecation warning for ‘N’ specifier in
      Decimal format is not raised for cases where ‘N’ appears in
      other places in the format specifier. Based on patch by Stefan
      Krah.
    - gh-70303: Return both files and directories from
      pathlib.Path.glob() if a pattern ends with “**”. Previously only
      directories were returned.
    - gh-109653: Improve import time of importlib.metadata and
      email.utils.
    - gh-113280: Fix a leak of open socket in rare cases when error
      occurred in ssl.SSLSocket creation.
    - gh-77749: email.policy.EmailPolicy.fold() now always encodes
      non-ASCII characters in headers if utf8 is false.
    - gh-83383: Synchronization of the dbm.dumb database is now no-op
      if there was no modification since opening or last
      synchronization. The directory file for a newly created empty
      dbm.dumb database is now created immediately after opening
      instead of deferring this until synchronizing or closing.
    - gh-91602: Add filter keyword-only parameter to
      sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() for filtering database objects to
      dump. Patch by Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-112451: Prohibit subclassing pure-Python datetime.timezone.
      This is consistent with C-extension implementation. Patch by
      Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-69893: Add the close() method for the iterator returned by
      xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse().
    - gh-109653: Reduce the import time of threading module by ~50%.
      Patch by Daniel Hollas.
    - gh-114492: Make the result of termios.tcgetattr() reproducible
      on Alpine Linux. Previously it could leave a random garbage in
      some fields.
    - gh-114315: Make threading.Lock a real class, not a factory
      function. Add __new__ to _thread.lock type.
    - gh-100414: Add dbm.sqlite3 as a backend to dbm, and make it the
      new default dbm backend. Patch by Raymond Hettinger and Erlend
      E. Aasland.
    - gh-113267: Revert changes in gh-106584 which made calls of
      TestResult methods startTest() and stopTest() unbalanced.
    - gh-75128: Ignore an OSError in
      asyncio.BaseEventLoop.create_server() when IPv6 is available but
      the interface cannot actually support it.
    - gh-114423: _DummyThread entries in threading._active are now
      automatically removed when the related thread dies.
    - gh-114257: Dismiss the FileNotFound error in
      ctypes.util.find_library() and just return None on Linux.
    - gh-114321: Expose more platform specific constants in the fcntl
      module on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
    - gh-114328: The tty.setcbreak() and new tty.cfmakecbreak() no
      longer clears the terminal input ICRLF flag. This fixes a
      regression introduced in 3.12 that no longer matched how OSes
      define cbreak mode in their stty(1) manual pages.
    - gh-114281: Remove type hints from Lib/asyncio/staggered.py. The
      annotations in the typeshed project should be used instead.
    - gh-101438: Avoid reference cycle in ElementTree.iterparse. The
      iterator returned by ElementTree.iterparse may hold on to a file
      descriptor. The reference cycle prevented prompt clean-up of the
      file descriptor if the returned iterator was not exhausted.
    - gh-114198: The signature for the __replace__ method on
      dataclasses now has the first argument named self, rather than
      obj.
    - gh-104522: OSError raised when run a subprocess now only has
      filename attribute set to cwd if the error was caused by a
      failed attempt to change the current directory.
    - gh-114149: Enum: correctly handle tuple subclasses in custom
      __new__.
    - gh-83648: Support deprecation of options, positional arguments
      and subcommands in argparse.
    - gh-114087: Speed up dataclasses.asdict up to 1.35x.
    - gh-109534: Fix a reference leak in
      asyncio.selector_events.BaseSelectorEventLoop when SSL
      handshakes fail. Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
    - gh-79634: Accept path-like objects as patterns in
      pathlib.Path.glob() and rglob().
    - gh-112202: Ensure that a asyncio.Condition.notify() call does
      not get lost if the awakened Task is simultaneously cancelled or
      encounters any other error.
    - gh-113951: Fix the behavior of tag_unbind() methods of
      tkinter.Text and tkinter.Canvas classes with three arguments.
      Previously, widget.tag_unbind(tag, sequence, funcid) destroyed
      the current binding for sequence, leaving sequence unbound, and
      deleted the funcid command. Now it removes only funcid from the
      binding for sequence, keeping other commands, and deletes the
      funcid command. It leaves sequence unbound only if funcid was
      the last bound command.
    - gh-97959: Fix rendering class methods, bound methods, method and
      function aliases in pydoc. Class methods no longer have “method
      of builtins.type instance” note. Corresponding notes are now
      added for class and unbound methods. Method and function aliases
      now have references to the module or the class where the origin
      was defined if it differs from the current. Bound methods are
      now listed in the static methods section. Methods of builtin
      classes are now supported as well as methods of Python classes.
    - gh-113796: Add more validation checks in the csv.Dialect
      constructor. ValueError is now raised if the same character is
      used in different roles.
    - gh-113732: Fix support of QUOTE_NOTNULL and QUOTE_STRINGS in
      csv.reader().
    - gh-113225: Speed up pathlib.Path.walk() by using
      os.DirEntry.path where possible.
    - gh-89039: When replace() method is called on a subclass of
      datetime, date or time, properly call derived constructor.
      Previously, only the base class’s constructor was called.
    - Also, make sure to pass non-zero fold values when creating
      subclasses in various methods. Previously, fold was silently
      ignored.
    - gh-112919: Speed-up datetime.datetime.replace(),
      datetime.date.replace() and datetime.time.replace().
    - gh-59013: Set breakpoint on the first executable line of the
      function, instead of the line of function definition when the
      user do break func using pdb
    - gh-112343: Improve handling of pdb convenience variables to
      avoid replacing string contents.
    - gh-112240: Add option to calendar module CLI to specify the
      weekday to start each week. Patch by Steven Ward.
    - gh-111741: Recognise image/webp as a standard format in the
      mimetypes module.
    - gh-43457: Fix the tkinter widget method wm_attributes(). It now
      accepts the attribute name without the minus prefix to get
      window attributes and allows to specify attributes and values to
      set as keyword arguments. Add new optional keyword argument
      return_python_dict: calling
      w.wm_attributes(return_python_dict=True) returns the attributes
      as a dict instead of a tuple. Calling w.wm_attributes() now
      returns a tuple instead of string if wantobjects was set to 0.
    - gh-82626: Many functions now emit a warning if a boolean value
      is passed as a file descriptor argument.
    - gh-111051: Added check for file modification during debugging
      with pdb
    - gh-110345: Show the Tcl/Tk patchlevel (rather than version) in
      tkinter._test().
    - gh-38807: Fix race condition in trace. Instead of checking if a
      directory exists and creating it, directly call os.makedirs()
      with the kwarg exist_ok=True.
    - gh-75705: Set unixfrom envelope in mailbox.mbox and
      mailbox.MMDF.
    - gh-106233: Fix stacklevel in InvalidTZPathWarning during
      zoneinfo module import.
    - gh-105102: Allow ctypes.Union to be nested in ctypes.Structure
      when the system endianness is the opposite of the classes.
    - gh-104282: Fix null pointer dereference in
      lzma._decode_filter_properties() due to improper handling of BCJ
      filters with properties of zero length. Patch by Radislav
      Chugunov.
    - gh-96471: Add queue.Queue termination with shutdown().
    - gh-101599: Changed argparse flag options formatting to remove
      redundancy.
    - gh-85984: Add POSIX pseudo-terminal functions os.posix_openpt(),
      os.grantpt(), os.unlockpt(), and os.ptsname().
    - gh-102512: When os.fork() is called from a foreign thread (aka
      _DummyThread), the type of the thread in a child process is
      changed to _MainThread. Also changed its name and daemonic
      status, it can be now joined.
    - gh-88569: Add os.path.isreserved(), which identifies reserved
      pathnames such as “NUL”, “AUX” and “CON”. This function is only
      available on Windows.
    - Deprecate pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved().
    - bpo-38364: The inspect functions isgeneratorfunction,
      iscoroutinefunction, isasyncgenfunction now support
      functools.partialmethod wrapped functions the same way they
      support functools.partial.
  - Documentation
    - gh-115233: Fix an example for LoggerAdapter in the Logging
      Cookbook.
    - gh-114123: Move the csv module docstring to the csv module
      instead of reexporting it from the internal _csv module, and
      remove __doc__ from csv.__all__.
    - Move csv.__version__ to the csv module instead of reexporting it
      from the internal _csv module, and remove __version__ from
      csv.__all__.  Test- s
    - gh-114099: Added test exclusions required to run the test suite
      on iOS.
    - gh-105089: Fix
      test.test_zipfile.test_core.TestWithDirectory.test_create_directory_with_write
      test in AIX by doing a bitwise AND of 0xFFFF on mode , so that
      it will be in sync with zinfo.external_attr Buil- d
    - gh-115167: Avoid vendoring vcruntime140_threads.dll when
      building with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.
    - gh-113632: Promote WASI to a tier 2 platform and drop Emscripten
      from tier 3 in configure.ac.
    - gh-114099: configure and Makefile were refactored to accomodate
      framework builds on Apple platforms other than macOS.
    - gh-114875: Add getgrent() as a prerequisite for building the grp
      module.  Wind- ows
    - gh-115049: Fixes py.exe launcher failing when run as users
      without user profiles.
    - gh-115009: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.45.1.
    - gh-109991: Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.13.
    - gh-111239: Update Windows builds to use zlib v1.3.1.
    - gh-100107: The py.exe launcher will no longer attempt to run the
      Microsoft Store redirector when launching a script containing a
      /usr/bin/env shebang
    - gh-112984: Adds free-threaded binaries to Windows installer as
      an optional component.
    - gh-89240: Allows multiprocessing to create pools of greater than
      62 processes.
  - IDLE
    - gh-96905: In idlelib code, stop redefining built-ins ‘dict’ and
      ‘object’.
    - gh-103820: Revise IDLE bindings so that events from mouse button
      4/5 on non-X11 windowing systems (i.e. Win32 and Aqua) are not
      mistaken for scrolling.
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-113516: Don’t set LDSHARED when building for WASI.
    - gh-109991: Update GitHub CI workflows to use OpenSSL 3.0.13 and
      multissltests to use 1.1.1w, 3.0.13, 3.1.5, and 3.2.1.
    - gh-115015: Fix a bug in Argument Clinic that generated incorrect
      code for methods with no parameters that use the METH_METHOD |
      METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS calling convention. Only the
      positional parameter count was checked; any keyword argument
      passed would be silently accepted.
  - C API
    - gh-111140: Adds PyLong_AsNativeBytes(), PyLong_FromNativeBytes()
      and PyLong_FromUnsignedNativeBytes() functions.
    - gh-114685: PyBuffer_FillInfo() now raises a SystemError if
      called with PyBUF_READ or PyBUF_WRITE as flags. These flags
      should only be used with the PyMemoryView_* C API.
    - gh-114685: PyObject_GetBuffer() now raises a SystemError if
      called with PyBUF_READ or PyBUF_WRITE as flags. These flags
      should only be used with the PyMemoryView_* C API.
    - gh-114626: Add PyCFunctionFast and PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords
      typedefs (identical to the existing _PyCFunctionFast and
      _PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords typedefs, just without a leading _
      prefix).
    - gh-114329: Add PyList_GetItemRef(), which is similar to
      PyList_GetItem() but returns a strong reference instead of a
      borrowed reference.
    - gh-110850: Add PyTime C API:
      * PyTime_t type.
      * PyTime_MIN and PyTime_MAX constants.
      * PyTime_AsSecondsDouble(), PyTime_Monotonic(), PyTime_PerfCounter(), and PyTime_Time() functions.
    - gh-112066: Add PyDict_SetDefaultRef(): insert a key and value
      into a dictionary if the key is not already present. This is
      similar to dict.setdefault(), but returns an integer value
      indicating if the key was already present. It is also similar to
      PyDict_SetDefault(), but returns a strong reference instead of a
      borrowed reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 18:12:05 UTC 2024 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Add gh115133-XMLPullParserTest-fail.patch to make
  Python building with the current libexpat 2.6.0
  (gh#python/cpython#115133).
- Switch to %%autopatch. Let’s try it as an experiment, and if we
  need conditional patch, we should put condition inside of it.
- Remove double definition of /usr/bin/idle%%{version} in
  %%files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 08:10:09 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0a3
  - Security
    - gh-113659: Skip .pth files with names starting with a dot or
      hidden file attribute.
    - gh-112302: Created a Software Bill-of-Materials document and
      tooling for tracking dependencies.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-107901: Compiler duplicates basic blocks that have an eval
      breaker check, no line number, and multiple predecessors.
    - gh-107901: A jump leaving an exception handler back to normal
      code no longer checks the eval breaker.
    - gh-113655: Set the C recursion limit to 4000 on Windows, and
      10000 on Linux/OSX. This seems to be near the sweet spot to
      maintain safety, but not compromise backwards compatibility.
    - gh-113710: Add typed stack effects to the interpreter DSL, along
      with various instruction annotations.
    - gh-77046: On Windows, file descriptors wrapping Windows handles
      are now created non inheritable by default (PEP 446). Patch by
      Zackery Spytz and Victor Stinner.
    - gh-113853: Guarantee that all executors make progress. This then
      guarantees that tier 2 execution always makes progress.
    - gh-113753: Fix an issue where the finalizer of PyAsyncGenASend
      objects might not be called if they were allocated from a free
      list.
    - gh-107901: Compiler changed so that synthetic jumps which are
      not at loop end no longer check the eval breaker.
    - gh-113703: Fix a regression in the codeop module that was
      causing it to incorrectly identify incomplete f-strings. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-89811: Check for a valid tp_version_tag before performing
      bytecode specializations that rely on this value being usable.
    - gh-111488: Changed error message in case of no ‘in’ keyword
      after ‘for’ in list comprehensions
    - gh-113657: Fix an issue that caused important instruction
      pointer updates to be optimized out of tier two traces.
    - gh-113603: Fixed bug where a redundant NOP is not removed,
      causing an assertion to fail in the compiler in debug mode.
    - gh-113602: Fix an error that was causing the parser to try to
      overwrite existing errors and crashing in the process. Patch by
      Pablo Galindo
    - gh-113486: No longer issue spurious PY_UNWIND events for
      optimized calls to classes.
    - gh-113297: Fix segfault in the compiler on with statement with
      19 context managers.
    - gh-113212: Improve super error messages.
    - gh-111375: Only use NULL in the exception stack to indicate an
      exception was handled. Patch by Carey Metcalfe.
    - gh-112215: Increase the C recursion limit by a factor of 3 for
      non-debug builds, except for webassembly and s390 platforms
      which are unchanged. This mitigates some regressions in 3.12
      with deep recursion mixing builtin (C) and Python code.
    - gh-113054: Fixed bug where a redundant NOP is not removed,
      causing an assertion to fail in the compiler in debug mode.
    - gh-106905: Use per AST-parser state rather than global state to
      track recursion depth within the AST parser to prevent potential
      race condition due to simultaneous parsing.
    - The issue primarily showed up in 3.11 by multithreaded users of
      ast.parse(). In 3.12 a change to when garbage collection can be
      triggered prevented the race condition from occurring.
    - gh-108866: Change the API and contract of _PyExecutorObject to
      return the next_instr pointer, instead of the frame, and to
      always execute at least one instruction.
    - gh-90350: Optimize builtin functions min() and max().
    - gh-112943: Correctly compute end column offsets for multiline
      tokens in the tokenize module. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112125: Fix None.__ne__(None) returning NotImplemented
      instead of False
    - gh-74616: input() now raises a ValueError when output on the
      terminal if the prompt contains embedded null characters instead
      of silently truncating it.
    - gh-112716: Fix SystemError in the import statement and in
      __reduce__() methods of builtin types when __builtins__ is not a
      dict.
    - gh-112730: Use color to highlight error locations in tracebacks.
      Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112625: Fixes a bug where a bytearray object could be cleared
      while iterating over an argument in the bytearray.join() method
      that could result in reading memory after it was freed.
    - gh-112660: Do not clear unexpected errors during formatting
      error messages for ImportError and AttributeError for modules.
    - gh-105967: Workaround a bug in Apple’s macOS platform zlib
      library where zlib.crc32() and binascii.crc32() could produce
      incorrect results on multi-gigabyte inputs. Including when using
      zipfile on zips containing large data.
    - gh-95754: Provide a better error message when accessing invalid
      attributes on partially initialized modules. The origin of the
      module being accessed is now included in the message to help
      with the common issue of shadowing other modules.
    - gh-112217: Add check for the type of __cause__ returned from
      calling the type T in raise from T.
    - gh-111058: Change coro.cr_frame/gen.gi_frame to return None
      after the coroutine/generator has been closed. This fixes a bug
      where getcoroutinestate() and getgeneratorstate() return the
      wrong state for a closed coroutine/generator.
    - gh-112388: Fix an error that was causing the parser to try to
      overwrite tokenizer errors. Patch by pablo Galindo
    - gh-112387: Fix error positions for decoded strings with
      backwards tokenize errors. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-99606: Make code generated for an empty f-string identical to
      the code of an empty normal string.
    - gh-112367: Avoid undefined behaviour when using the perf
      trampolines by not freeing the code arenas until shutdown. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-112320: The Tier 2 translator now tracks the confidence level
      for staying “on trace” (i.e. not exiting back to the Tier 1
      interpreter) for branch instructions based on the number of bits
      set in the branch “counter”. Trace translation ends when the
      confidence drops below 1/3rd.
    - gh-109598: PyComplex_RealAsDouble()/PyComplex_ImagAsDouble() now
      tries to convert an object to a complex instance using its
      __complex__() method before falling back to the __float__()
      method. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-94606: Fix UnicodeEncodeError when
      email.message.get_payload() reads a message with a Unicode
      surrogate character and the message content is not well-formed
      for surrogateescape encoding. Patch by Sidney Markowitz.
    - bpo-21861: Use the object’s actual class name in
      _io.FileIO.__repr__(), _io._WindowsConsoleIO() and
      _io.TextIOWrapper.__repr__(), to make these methods subclass
      friendly.
    - bpo-45369: Remove LibreSSL workarounds as per PEP 644.
    - bpo-34392: Added sys._is_interned().  Libr- ary
    - gh-114077: Fix possible OverflowError in
      socket.socket.sendfile() when pass count larger than 2 GiB on
      32-bit platform.
    - gh-111803: plistlib now supports loading more deeply nested
      lists in binary format.
    - gh-114014: Fixed a bug in fractions.Fraction where an invalid
      string using d in the decimals part creates a different error
      compared to other invalid letters/characters. Patch by Jeremiah
      Gabriel Pascual.
    - gh-108364: sqlite3.Connection.iterdump() now ensures that
      foreign key support is disabled before dumping the database
      schema, if there is any foreign key violation. Patch by Erlend
      E. Aasland and Mariusz Felisiak.
    - gh-113971: The zipfile.ZipInfo previously protected
      ._compresslevel attribute has been made public as
      .compress_level with the old _compresslevel name remaining
      available as a property to retain compatibility.
    - gh-113877: Fix tkinter method winfo_pathname() on 64-bit
      Windows.
    - gh-113868: Added mmap.MAP_NORESERVE, mmap.MAP_NOEXTEND,
      mmap.MAP_HASSEMAPHORE, mmap.MAP_NOCACHE, mmap.MAP_JIT,
      mmap.MAP_RESILIENT_CODESIGN, mmap.MAP_RESILIENT_MEDIA,
      mmap.MAP_32BIT, mmap.MAP_TRANSLATED_ALLOW_EXECUTE,
      mmap.MAP_UNIX03 and mmap.MAP_TPRO. All of them are mmap(2) flags
      on macOS.
    - gh-113848: asyncio.TaskGroup() and asyncio.timeout() context
      managers now handle CancelledError subclasses as well as exact
      CancelledError.
    - gh-113661: unittest runner: Don’t exit 5 if tests were skipped.
      The intention of exiting 5 was to detect issues where the test
      suite wasn’t discovered at all. If we skipped tests, it was
      correctly discovered.
    - gh-96037: Insert TimeoutError in the context of the exception
      that was raised during exiting an expired asyncio.timeout()
      block.
    - gh-113781: Silence unraisable AttributeError when warnings are
      emitted during Python finalization.
    - gh-113238: Add Anchor to importlib.resources (in order for the
      code to comply with the documentation)
    - gh-111693: asyncio.Condition.wait() now re-raises the same
      CancelledError instance that may have caused it to be
      interrupted. Fixed race condition in asyncio.Semaphore.aquire()
      when interrupted with a CancelledError.
    - gh-113791: Add CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW_APPROX and
      CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW_APPROX to time on macOS. These are clocks
      available on macOS 10.12 or later.
    - gh-112932: Restore the ability for zipfile to extractall from
      zip files with a “/” directory entry in them as is commonly
      added to zips by some wiki or bug tracker data exporters.
    - gh-113568: Raise deprecation warnings from pathlib.PurePath and
      not its private base class PurePathBase.
    - gh-113594: Fix UnicodeEncodeError in email when re-fold lines
      that contain unknown-8bit encoded part followed by
      non-unknown-8bit encoded part.
    - gh-113538: In asyncio.StreamReaderProtocol.connection_made(),
      there is callback that logs an error if the task wrapping the
      “connected callback” fails. This callback would itself fail if
      the task was cancelled. Prevent this by checking whether the
      task was cancelled first. If so, close the transport but don’t
      log an error.
    - gh-113626: Add support for the allow_code argument in the
      marshal module. Passing allow_code=False prevents serialization
      and de-serialization of code objects which is incompatible
      between Python versions.
    - gh-85567: Fix resource warnings for unclosed files in pickle and
      pickletools command line interfaces.
    - gh-113537: Support loads str in plistlib.loads().
    - gh-89850: Add default implementations of
      pickle.Pickler.persistent_id() and
      pickle.Unpickler.persistent_load() methods in the C
      implementation. Calling super().persistent_id() and
      super().persistent_load() in subclasses of the C implementation
      of pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler classes no longer causes
      infinite recursion.
    - gh-113569: Indicate if there were no actual calls in unittest
      assert_has_calls() failure.
    - gh-101225: Increase the backlog for
      multiprocessing.connection.Listener objects created by
      multiprocessing.manager and multiprocessing.resource_sharer to
      significantly reduce the risk of getting a connection refused
      error when creating a multiprocessing.connection.Connection to
      them.
    - gh-113568: Raise audit events from pathlib.Path and not its
      private base class PathBase.
    - gh-113543: Make sure that webbrowser.MacOSXOSAScript sends
      webbrowser.open audit event.
    - gh-113028: When a second reference to a string appears in the
      input to pickle, and the Python implementation is in use, we are
      guaranteed that a single copy gets pickled and a single object
      is shared when reloaded. Previously, in protocol 0, when a
      string contained certain characters (e.g. newline) it resulted
      in duplicate objects.
    - gh-113421: Fix multiprocessing logger for %(filename)s.
    - gh-111784: Fix segfaults in the _elementtree module. Fix first
      segfault during deallocation of _elementtree.XMLParser instances
      by keeping strong reference to pyexpat module in module state
      for capsule lifetime. Fix second segfault which happens in the
      same deallocation process by keeping strong reference to
      _elementtree module in XMLParser structure for _elementtree
      module lifetime.
    - gh-113407: Fix import of unittest.mock when CPython is built
      without docstrings.
    - gh-113320: Fix regression in Python 3.12 where Protocol classes
      that were not marked as runtime-checkable would be unnecessarily
      introspected, potentially causing exceptions to be raised if the
      protocol had problematic members. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-53502: Add a new option aware_datetime in plistlib to loads
      or dumps aware datetime.
    - gh-113358: Fix rendering tracebacks with exceptions with a
      broken __getattr__
    - gh-113214: Fix an AttributeError during asyncio SSL protocol
      aborts in SSL-over-SSL scenarios.
    - gh-113246: Update bundled pip to 23.3.2.
    - gh-87264: Fixed tarfile list() method to show file type.
    - gh-112182: asyncio.futures.Future.set_exception() now transforms
      StopIteration into RuntimeError instead of hanging or other
      misbehavior. Patch contributed by Jamie Phan.
    - gh-113225: Speed up pathlib.Path.glob() by using
      os.DirEntry.path where possible.
    - gh-113149: Improve error message when a JSON array or object
      contains a trailing comma. Patch by Carson Radtke.
    - gh-113117: The subprocess module can now use the
      os.posix_spawn() function with close_fds=True on platforms where
      posix_spawn_file_actions_addclosefrom_np is available. Patch by
      Jakub Kulik.
    - gh-113199: Make http.client.HTTPResponse.read1 and
      http.client.HTTPResponse.readline close IO after reading all
      data when content length is known. Patch by Illia Volochii.
    - gh-113191: Add support of os.fchmod() and a file descriptor in
      os.chmod() on Windows.
    - gh-113188: Fix shutil.copymode() and shutil.copystat() on
      Windows. Previously they worked differenly if dst is a symbolic
      link: they modified the permission bits of dst itself rather
      than the file it points to if follow_symlinks is true or src is
      not a symbolic link, and did not modify the permission bits if
      follow_symlinks is false and src is a symbolic link.
    - gh-113119: os.posix_spawn() now accepts env=None, which makes
      the newly spawned process use the current process environment.
      Patch by Jakub Kulik.
    - gh-113202: Add a strict option to batched() in the itertools
      module.
    - gh-61648: Detect line numbers of properties in doctests.
    - gh-113175: Sync with importlib_metadata 7.0, including improved
      type annotations, fixed issue with symlinked packages in
      package_distributions, added EntryPoints.__repr__, introduced
      the diagnose script, added Distribution.origin property, and
      removed deprecated EntryPoint access by numeric index (tuple
      behavior).
    - gh-59616: Add support of os.lchmod() and the follow_symlinks
      argument in os.chmod() on Windows. Note that the default value
      of follow_symlinks in os.lchmod() is False on Windows.
    - gh-112559: signal.signal() and signal.getsignal() no longer call
      repr on callable handlers. asyncio.run() and
      asyncio.Runner.run() no longer call repr on the task results.
      Patch by Yilei Yang.
    - gh-112962: dis module functions add cache information to the
      Instruction instance rather than creating fake Instruction
      instances to represent the cache entries.
    - gh-112989: Reduce overhead to connect sockets with asyncio
      SelectorEventLoop.
    - gh-112970: Use closefrom() on Linux where available (e.g.
      glibc-2.34), rather than only FreeBSD.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on PPC64LE platform by
      setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 64 in stgdict. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-112540: The statistics.geometric_mean() function now returns
      zero for datasets containing a zero. Formerly, it would raise an
      exception.
    - gh-87286: Added LOG_FTP, LOG_NETINFO, LOG_REMOTEAUTH,
      LOG_INSTALL, LOG_RAS, and LOG_LAUNCHD tot the syslog module, all
      of them constants on used on macOS.
    - gh-112800: Fix asyncio SubprocessTransport.close() not to throw
      PermissionError when used with setuid executables.
    - gh-51944: Add the following constants to the termios module.
      These values are present in macOS system headers: ALTWERASE,
      B14400, B28800, B7200, B76800, CCAR_OFLOW, CCTS_OFLOW,
      CDSR_OFLOW, CDTR_IFLOW, CIGNORE, CRTS_IFLOW, EXTPROC, IUTF8,
      MDMBUF, NL2, NL3, NOKERNINFO, ONOEOT, OXTABS, VDSUSP, VSTATUS.
    - gh-79325: Fix an infinite recursion error in
      tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() cleanup on Windows.
    - gh-94692: shutil.rmtree() now only catches OSError exceptions.
      Previously a symlink attack resistant version of shutil.rmtree()
      could ignore or pass to the error handler arbitrary exception
      when invalid arguments were provided.
    - gh-112736: The use of del-safe symbols in subprocess was
      refactored to allow for use in cross-platform build
      environments.
    - gh-112727: Speed up pathlib.Path.absolute(). Patch by Barney
      Gale.
    - gh-74690: Speedup issubclass() checks against simple
      runtime-checkable protocols by around 6%. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-74690: Speedup isinstance() checks by roughly 20% for
      runtime-checkable protocols that only have one callable member.
      Speedup issubclass() checks for these protocols by roughly 10%.
      Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-112645: Remove deprecation error on passing onerror to
      shutil.rmtree().
    - gh-112640: Add kwdefaults parameter to types.FunctionType to set
      default keyword argument values.
    - gh-112622: Ensure name parameter is passed to event loop in
      asyncio.create_task().
    - gh-112618: Fix a caching bug relating to typing.Annotated.
      Annotated[str, True] is no longer identical to Annotated[str,
      1].
    - gh-112334: Fixed a performance regression in 3.12’s subprocess
      on Linux where it would no longer use the fast-path vfork()
      system call when it could have due to a logic bug, instead
      falling back to the safe but slower fork().
    - Also fixed a second 3.12.0 potential security bug. If a value of
      extra_groups=[] was passed to subprocess.Popen or related APIs,
      the underlying setgroups(0, NULL) system call to clear the
      groups list would not be made in the child process prior to
      exec().
    - This was identified via code inspection in the process of fixing
      the first bug.
    - gh-110190: Fix ctypes structs with array on Arm platform by
      setting MAX_STRUCT_SIZE to 32 in stgdict. Patch by Diego Russo.
    - gh-81194: Fix a crash in socket.if_indextoname() with specific
      value (UINT_MAX). Fix an integer overflow in
      socket.if_indextoname() on 64-bit non-Windows platforms.
    - gh-112578: Fix a spurious RuntimeWarning when executing the
      zipfile module.
    - gh-112516: Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.3.1.
    - gh-112510: Add readline.backend for the backend readline uses
      (editline or readline)
    - gh-112328: [Enum] Make EnumDict, EnumDict.member_names,
      EnumType._add_alias_ and EnumType._add_value_alias_ public.
    - gh-112509: Fix edge cases that could cause a key to be present
      in both the __required_keys__ and __optional_keys__ attributes
      of a typing.TypedDict. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-101336: Add keep_alive keyword parameter for
      AbstractEventLoop.create_server() and
      BaseEventLoop.create_server().
    - gh-63284: Added support for TLS-PSK (pre-shared key) mode to the
      ssl module.
    - gh-112414: Fix regression in Python 3.12 where calling repr() on
      a module that had been imported using a custom loader could fail
      with AttributeError. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-112358: Revert change to struct.Struct initialization that
      broke some cases of subclassing.
    - gh-112405: Optimize pathlib.PurePath.relative_to(). Patch by
      Alex Waygood.

    - gh-112361: Speed up a small handful of pathlib methods by
      removing some temporary objects.
    - gh-112345: Improve error message when trying to call
      issubclass() against a typing.Protocol that has non-method
      members. Patch by Randolf Scholz.
    - gh-112137: Change dis output to display no-lineno as “–” instead
      of “None”.
    - gh-112332: Deprecate the exc_type field of
      traceback.TracebackException. Add exc_type_str to replace it.
    - gh-81620: Add extra tests for random.binomialvariate()
    - gh-112292: Fix a crash in readline when imported from a sub
      interpreter. Patch by Anthony Shaw
    - gh-77621: Slightly improve the import time of the pathlib module
      by deferring some imports. Patch by Barney Gale.
    - gh-112137: Change dis output to display logical labels for jump
      targets instead of offsets.
    - gh-112139: Add Signature.format() to format signatures to string
      with extra options. And use it in pydoc to render more readable
      signatures that have new lines between parameters.
    - gh-112105: Make readline.set_completer_delims() work with
      libedit
    - gh-106922: Display multiple lines with traceback when errors
      span multiple lines.
    - gh-111874: When creating a typing.NamedTuple class, ensure
      __set_name__() is called on all objects that define __set_name__
      and exist in the values of the NamedTuple class’s class
      dictionary. Patch by Alex Waygood.
    - gh-68166: Add support of the “vsapi” element type in
      tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create().
    - gh-110275: Named tuple’s methods _replace() and __replace__()
      now raise TypeError instead of ValueError for invalid keyword
      arguments.
    - gh-99367: Do not mangle sys.path[0] in pdb if safe_path is set
    - gh-111615: Fix a regression caused by a fix to gh-93162 whereby
      you couldn’t configure a QueueHandler without specifying
      handlers.
    - gh-75666: Fix the behavior of tkinter widget’s unbind() method
      with two arguments. Previously, widget.unbind(sequence, funcid)
      destroyed the current binding for sequence, leaving sequence
      unbound, and deleted the funcid command. Now it removes only
      funcid from the binding for sequence, keeping other commands,
      and deletes the funcid command. It leaves sequence unbound only
      if funcid was the last bound command.
    - gh-67790: Implement basic formatting support (minimum width,
      alignment, fill) for fractions.Fraction.
    - gh-111049: Fix crash during garbage collection of the io.BytesIO
      buffer object.
    - gh-102980: Redirect the output of interact command of pdb to the
      same channel as the debugger. Add tests and improve docs.
    - gh-102988: email.utils.getaddresses() and
      email.utils.parseaddr() now return ('', '') 2-tuples in more
      situations where invalid email addresses are encountered instead
      of potentially inaccurate values. Add optional strict parameter
      to these two functions: use strict=False to get the old
      behavior, accept malformed inputs. getattr(email.utils,
      'supports_strict_parsing', False) can be use to check if the
      strict paramater is available. Patch by Thomas Dwyer and Victor
      Stinner to improve the CVE-2023-27043 fix.
    - gh-52161: cmd.Cmd.do_help() now cleans docstrings with
      inspect.cleandoc() before writing them. Patch by Filip
      Łapkiewicz.
    - gh-82300: Add track parameter to
      multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory that allows using
      shared memory blocks without having to register with the POSIX
      resource tracker that automatically releases them upon process
      exit.
    - gh-110109: Add private pathlib._PurePathBase class: a base class
      for pathlib.PurePath that omits certain magic methods. It may be
      made public (along with _PathBase) in future.
    - gh-109858: Protect zipfile from “quoted-overlap” zipbomb. It now
      raises BadZipFile when try to read an entry that overlaps with
      other entry or central directory.
    - gh-109786: Fix possible reference leaks and crash when re-enter
      the __next__() method of itertools.pairwise.
    - gh-91539: Small (10 - 20%) and trivial performance improvement
      of urrlib.request.getproxies_environment(), typically useful
      when there are many environment variables to go over.
    - gh-103363: Add follow_symlinks keyword-only argument to
      pathlib.Path.owner() and group(), defaulting to True.
    - gh-102130: Support tab completion in cmd for editline.
    - gh-99437: runpy.run_path() now decodes path-like objects, making
      sure __file__ and sys.argv[0] of the module being run are always
      strings.
    - gh-104003: Add warnings.deprecated(), a decorator to mark
      deprecated functions to static type checkers and to warn on
      usage of deprecated classes and functions. See PEP 702. Patch by
      Jelle Zijlstra.
    - gh-103708: Make hardcoded python name, a configurable parameter
      so that different implementations of python can override it
      instead of making huge diffs in sysconfig.py
    - gh-66515: mailbox.MH now supports folders that do not contain a
      .mh_sequences file (e.g. Claws Mail IMAP-cache folders). Patch
      by Serhiy Storchaka.
    - gh-83162: Renamed re.error to PatternError for clarity, and kept
      re.error for backward compatibility. Patch by Matthias
      Bussonnier and Adam Chhina.
    - gh-91133: Fix a bug in tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup,
      which now no longer dereferences symlinks when working around
      file system permission errors.
    - bpo-43153: On Windows, tempfile.TemporaryDirectory previously
      masked a PermissionError with NotADirectoryError during
      directory cleanup. It now correctly raises PermissionError if
      errors are not ignored. Patch by Andrei Kulakov and Ken Jin.
    - bpo-32731: getpass.getuser() now raises OSError for all failures
      rather than ImportError on systems lacking the pwd module or
      KeyError if the password database is empty.
    - bpo-34321: mmap.mmap now has a trackfd parameter on Unix; if it
      is False, the file descriptor specified by fileno will not be
      duplicated.
    - bpo-35332: The shutil.rmtree() function now ignores errors when
      calling os.close() when ignore_errors is True, and os.close() no
      longer retried after error.
    - bpo-35928: io.TextIOWrapper now correctly handles the decoding
      buffer after read() and write().
    - bpo-26791: shutil.move() now moves a symlink into a directory
      when that directory is the target of the symlink. This provides
      the same behavior as the mv shell command. The previous behavior
      raised an exception. Patch by Jeffrey Kintscher.
    - bpo-41422: Fixed memory leaks of pickle.Pickler and
      pickle.Unpickler involving cyclic references via the internal
      memo mapping.
    - bpo-19821: The pydoc.ispackage() function has been deprecated.
    - bpo-40262: The ssl.SSLSocket.recv_into() method no longer
      requires the buffer argument to implement __len__ and supports
      buffers with arbitrary item size.
    - bpo-39912: warnings.filterwarnings() and warnings.simplefilter()
      now raise appropriate exceptions instead of AssertionError.
      Patch contributed by Rémi Lapeyre.
    - bpo-37260: Fixed a race condition in shutil.rmtree() in which
      directory entries removed by another process or thread while
      shutil.rmtree() is running can cause it to raise
      FileNotFoundError. Patch by Jeffrey Kintscher.
    - bpo-36959: Fix some error messages for invalid ISO format string
      combinations in strptime() that referred to directives not
      contained in the format string. Patch by Gordon P. Hemsley.
    - bpo-18060: Fixed a class inheritance issue that can cause
      segfaults when deriving two or more levels of subclasses from a
      base class of Structure or Union.
    - bpo-29779: Add a new PYTHON_HISTORY environment variable to set
      the location of a .python_history file.
    - bpo-21360: mailbox.Maildir now ignores files with a leading dot.
  - Documentation
    - gh-111699: Relocate smtpd deprecation notice to its own section
      rather than under locale in What’s New in Python 3.12 document
    - gh-110746: Improved markup for valid options/values for methods
      ttk.treeview.column and ttk.treeview.heading, and for Layouts.
    - gh-95649: Document that the asyncio module contains code taken
      from v0.16.0 of the uvloop project, as well as the required MIT
      licensing information.
  - Tests
    - gh-111798: Disable test_super_deep() from test_call under
      pydebug builds on WASI; the stack depth is too small to make the
      test useful.
    - gh-111801: Lower the recursion limit in test_isinstance for
      test_infinitely_many_bases(). This prevents a stack overflow on
      a pydebug build of WASI.
    - gh-111802: Specify a low recursion depth for test_bad_getattr()
      in test.pickletester to avoid exhausting the stack under a
      pydebug build for WASI.
    - gh-44626: Fix os.path.isabs() incorrectly returning True when
      given a path that starts with exactly one (back)slash on
      Windows.
    - Fix pathlib.PureWindowsPath.is_absolute() incorrectly returning
      False for some paths beginning with two (back)slashes.
    - gh-113633: Use module state for the _testcapi extension module.
    - gh-109980: Fix test_tarfile_vs_tar in test_shutil for macOS,
      where system tar can include more information in the archive
      than shutil.make_archive.
    - gh-112769: The tests now correctly compare zlib version when
      zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION contains non-integer suffixes. For
      example zlib-ng defines the version as 1.3.0.zlib-ng.
    - gh-112334: Adds a regression test to verify that vfork() is used
      when expected by subprocess on vfork enabled POSIX systems
      (Linux).
    - gh-108927: Fixed order dependence in running tests in the same
      process when a test that has submodules (e.g. test_importlib)
      follows a test that imports its submodule (e.g.
      test_importlib.util) and precedes a test (e.g. test_unittest or
      test_compileall) that uses that submodule.
    - bpo-40648: Test modes that file can get with chmod() on Windows.
  - Build
    - gh-114013: Fix Tools/wasm/wasi.py to not include the path to
      python.wasm as part of HOSTRUNNER. The environment variable is
      meant to specify how to run the WASI host only, having
      python.wasm and relevant flags appended to the HOSTRUNNER. This
      fixes make test work.
    - gh-113258: Changed the Windows build to write out generated
      frozen modules into the build tree instead of the source tree.
    - gh-112305: Fixed the check-clean-src step performed on out of
      tree builds to detect errant $(srcdir)/Python/frozen_modules/*.h
      files and recommend appropriate source tree cleanup steps to get
      a working build again.
    - gh-112536: Add support for thread sanitizer (TSAN)
    - gh-112867: Fix the build for the case that
      WITH_PYMALLOC_RADIX_TREE=0 set.
    - gh-103065: Introduce Tools/wasm/wasi.py to simplify doing a WASI
      build.
    - bpo-11102: The os.major(), os.makedev(), and os.minor()
      functions are now available on HP-UX v3.
    - bpo-36351: Do not set ipv6type when cross-compiling.
  - IDLE
    - gh-72284: Improve the lists of features, editor key bindings,
      and shell key bingings in the IDLE doc.
    - gh-113903: Fix rare failure of test.test_idle, in
      test_configdialog.
    - gh-113729: Fix the “Help -> IDLE Doc” menu bug in 3.11.7 and
      3.12.1.

- Update to 3.13.0a2:

Python 3.13.0 alpha 2¶
  - Core and Builtins:
    - Don’t include comments in f-string debug expressions. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - Slightly optimize the Tier 2 (uop) interpreter by only
      loading oparg and operand when needed. Also double the
      trace size limit again, to 512 this time.
    - Change docstrings of __dict__ and __weakref__.
    - Lower the max parser stack depth to 1000 under WASI debug
      builds.
    - When Python is built in debug mode, set the C recursion
      limit to 500 instead of 1500. A debug build is likely built
      with low optimization level which implies higher stack
      memory usage than a release build. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Enable translating unspecialized FOR_ITER to Tier 2.
    - Make hashlib related modules thread-safe without the GIL
    - Deprecate assignment to a function’s __code__ field when
      the new code object is of a mismatched type (e.g., from a
      generator to a plain function).
    - Raise exception if frame.clear() is called on a suspended
      frame.
    - Implement native thread ids for GNU KFreeBSD.
    - Use exponential backoff to reduce the number of failed tier
      2 optimization attempts by over 99%.
    - Joining a thread now ensures the underlying OS thread has
      exited. This is required for safer fork() in multi-threaded
      processes.
    - Make sure that tier 2 traces are de-optimized if the code
      is instrumented
    - Specialize slot loads and stores for _Py_T_OBJECT as well
      as Py_T_OBJECT_EX
    - Speed up BaseExceptionGroup.derive(),
      BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup(), and
      BaseExceptionGroup.split() by changing how they parse
      passed arguments.
    - Fix runtime crash when some error happens in opcode
      LOAD_FROM_DICT_OR_DEREF.
    - Add support for sharing tuples between interpreters using
      the cross-interpreter API. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - The oparg of YIELD_VALUE is now 1 if the instruction
      is part of a yield-from or await, and 0 otherwise. The
      SUSPENDED frame state is now split into SUSPENDED and
      SUSPENDED_YIELD_FROM. This simplifies the code in
      _PyGen_yf.
    - Merge the Tier 1 (bytecode) and Tier 2 (micro-ops)
      interpreters together, moving the Tier 2 interpreter
      loop and switch into _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault() in
      Python/ceval.c. The Python/executor.c file is gone. Also
      the TIER_ONE and TIER_TWO macros are now handled by the
      code generator. Beware! This changes the environment
      variables to enable micro-ops and their debugging to
      PYTHON_UOPS and PYTHON_LLTRACE.
    - Speed up Traceback object creation by lazily compute the
      line number. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Allow type comments in parenthesized with statements
    - Add support for sharing floats between interpreters using
      the cross-interpreter API. Patch by Anthony Shaw.
    - Add support for sharing of True and False between
      interpreters using the cross-interpreter API. Patch by
      Anthony Shaw.
    - Fix a bug where iso2022_jp_3 and iso2022_jp_2004 codecs
      read out of bounds
    - Fix an issue in the codeop that was causing SyntaxError
      exceptions raised in the presence of invalid syntax to not
      contain precise error messages. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix a bug that was causing SyntaxWarning to appear twice
      when parsing if invalid syntax is encountered later. Patch
      by Pablo galindo
    - Added a new environment variable PYTHON_FROZEN_MODULES. It
      determines whether or not frozen modules are ignored by
      the import machinery, equivalent of the -X frozen_modules
      command-line option.
    - Remove oparg from YIELD_VALUE. Change oparg of RESUME to
      include information about the except-depth. These changes
      make it possible to simplify the code in generator close.
    - Fix a regression that prevented jumping across is None and
      is not None when debugging. Patch by Savannah Ostrowski.
    - Show source lines in tracebacks when using the -c option
      when running Python. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fix a bug where a global declaration in an except block is
      rejected when the global is used in the else block.
    - Fix error messages for indented blocks with functions
      and classes with generic type parameters. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo
    - Remove unnecessary instruction pointer updates before
      returning from frames.
    - Correctly display the traceback for MemoryError exceptions
      using the traceback module. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Fixed crash due to improperly initialized static
      MemoryError in subinterpreter.
    - Return NULL for PyTrace_RETURN events caused by an
      exception
    - Fix argument parsing by _PyArg_UnpackKeywordsWithVararg
      for functions defining pos-or-keyword, vararg, and kw-only
      parameters.
    - Replace prev_instr on the interpreter frame by instr_ptr
      which points to the beginning of the instruction that
      is currently executing (or will execute once the frame
      resumes).
    - Allow the repl to show source code and complete
      tracebacks. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - Add PYTHON_PRESITE=package.module to import a module
      early in the interpreter lifecycle before site.py is
      executed. Python needs to be built in debug mode for this
      option to exist.
    - Implement biased reference counting in --disable-gil
      builds.
    - Fix regression in Python 3.12 where
      types.CodeType.replace() would produce a broken code object
      if called on a module or class code object that contains a
      comprehension. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
    - Removed chained classmethod descriptors (introduced in
      bpo-19072). This can no longer be used to wrap other
      descriptors such as property. The core design of this
      feature was flawed and caused a number of downstream
      problems. To “pass-through” a classmethod, consider using
      the __wrapped__ attribute that was added in Python 3.10.
    - Use local events for opcode tracing
    - Add mimalloc memory allocator support.
    - When PyConfig.stdlib_dir is explicitly set, it’s now
      respected and won’t be overridden by PyConfig.home.
    - Fix incorrect SystemError about AST constructor recursion
      depth mismatch.
    - Improve error message for unterminated strings with
      escapes.
    - Improved error messages for elif/else statements not
      matching any valid statements. Patch by Jeremiah Vivian.
  - Library
    - Fix SystemError in the TextIOWrapper constructor with
      non-encodable “errors” argument in non-debug mode.
    - Added the NI_IDN constant to the socket module when present
      in C at build time for use with socket.getnameinfo().
    - Issue warning message instead of having RuntimeError be
      displayed when event loop has already been closed at
      StreamWriter.__del__().
    - Fix crashes in io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure() when pass
      invalid arguments, e.g. non-string encoding.
    - curses: restore wide character support (including
      curses.unget_wch() and get_wch()) on macOS, which was
      unavailable due to a regression in Python 3.12.
    - contextlib.suppress now supports suppressing exceptions
      raised as part of a BaseExceptionGroup, in addition to the
      recent support for ExceptionGroup.
    - The mmap.mmap class now has an seekable() method that
      can be used where it requires a file-like object with
      seekable and the seek() method return the new absolute
      position. Patch by Donghee Na.
    - Remove posix.fallocate() under WASI as the underlying
      posix_fallocate() is not available in WASI preview2.
    - Fix truncating arguments on an embedded null character in
      os.putenv() and os.unsetenv() on Windows.
    - wsgiref.util.is_hop_by_hop() is now exposed correctly in
      __all__.
    - Avoid executing the default function in cmd.Cmd in an
      except block
    - Fix doctest for SyntaxError not-builtin subclasses.
    - Add extra argument validation for alias command in pdb
    - time: Make time.clock_gettime() and time.clock_gettime_ns()
      functions up to 2x faster by faster calling
      convention. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Call loop exception handler for exceptions in
      client_connected_cb of asyncio.start_server() so that
      applications can handle it. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix reference leaks in bind_class() and bind_all() methods
      of tkinter widgets.
    - asyncio.loop.create_unix_server() will now automatically
      remove the Unix socket when the server is closed.
    - Added io.text_encoding(), io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, and
      io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder to io.__all__.
    - Remove the code to set the REMOTE_HOST header from wsgiref
      module, as it is unreachable. This header is used for
      performance reasons, which is not necessary in the wsgiref
      module.
    - Speed up pathlib.PurePath.relative_to() and
      is_relative_to().
    - Fixed typo in math.sumprod().
    - Remove mention of not supported “vsapi” element type
      in tkinter.ttk.Style.element_create(). Add tests for
      element_create() and other ttk.Style methods. Add examples
      for element_create() in the documentation.
    - Add show_group parameter to
      traceback.format_exception_only(), which allows to format
      ExceptionGroup instances.
    - Another attempt at fixing asyncio.Server.wait_closed(). It
      now blocks until both conditions are true: the server is
      closed, and there are no more active connections. (This
      means that in some cases where in 3.12.0 this function
      would incorrectly have returned immediately, it will now
      block; in particular, when there are no active connections
      but the server hasn’t been closed yet.)
    - Optimize recursive wildcards in pathlib.
    - Fix time not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Add error checking during _socket module init.
    - Fix _blake2 not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix select not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix ssl not checking for errors when initializing.
    - Fix crash in io.BytesIO.getbuffer() called repeatedly for
      empty BytesIO.
    - Postpone removal version for locale.getdefaultlocale() to
      Python 3.15.
    - Fix doctest output comparison for exceptions with notes.
    - Fix invalid state handling in asyncio.TaskGroup and
      asyncio.Timeout. They now raise proper RuntimeError if they
      are improperly used and are left in consistent state after
      this.
    - Make turtledemo run without default root enabled.
    - Support alias and convenience vars for pdb completion
    - Added newline parameter to pathlib.Path.read_text(). Patch
      by Junya Okabe.
    - Make pdb enter post-mortem mode even for SyntaxError
    - Set f_trace_lines = True on all frames upon pdb.set_trace()
    - Expose the setup and cleanup portions of
      asyncio.run_forever() as the standalone
      methods asyncio.run_forever_setup() and
      asyncio.run_forever_cleanup(). This allows for tighter
      integration with GUI event loops.
    - Support setting the asyncio.Runner loop_factory kwarg in
      unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase
    - Fix tty.setraw() and tty.setcbreak(): previously they
      returned partially modified list of the original tty
      attributes. tty.cfmakeraw() and tty.cfmakecbreak() now make
      a copy of the list of special characters before modifying
      it.
    - Make line number of function breakpoint more precise in pdb
    - Emit deprecation warning for non-integer numbers in gettext
      functions and methods that consider plural forms even if
      the translation was not found.
    - Ensure that select.kqueue() objects correctly appear as
      closed in forked children, to prevent operations on an
      invalid file descriptor.
    - Add __reduce__ method to IPv6Address in order to keep
      scope_id
    - Improve errors for unsupported look-behind patterns. Now
      re.error is raised instead of OverflowError or RuntimeError
      for too large width of look-behind pattern.
    - Add the ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped property, which
      retuns the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.
    - Implement the CLI of the symtable module and improve the
      repr of Symbol.
    - Improved error handling in pdb command line interface,
      making it produce more concise error messages.
    - Change compileall to only strip the stripdir prefix from  .
    Prthe full path recorded in the compiled .pyc file, when    .
    Prthe prefix matches the start of the full path in its      .
    Prentirety. When the prefix does not match, no stripping    .
    Pris performed and a warning to this effect is displayed    .
    Previously all path components of the stripdir prefix that  .
    Prmatched the full path were removed, while those that did  .
    Prnot match were left alone (including ones interspersed    .
    Prbetween matching components)                              .
    - Make the DictProxy and ListProxy types in
      multiprocessing.managers Generic Alias Types for [] use in
      typing contexts.
    - Add glob.translate(). This function converts a pathname
      with shell-style wildcards to a regular expression.
    - Define USE_XATTRS on Cygwin so that XATTR-related functions
      in the os module become available.
    - New methods mailbox.Maildir.get_info(),
      mailbox.Maildir.set_info(), mailbox.Maildir.get_flags(),
      mailbox.Maildir.set_flags(), mailbox.Maildir.add_flag(),
      mailbox.Maildir.remove_flag(). These methods speed up
      accessing a message’s info and/or flags and are useful
      when it is not necessary to access the message’s contents,
      as when iterating over a Maildir to find messages with
      specific flags.
    - Fix returning of empty byte strings after seek in zipfile
      module
    - Added a parameter local_exit for code.interact() to
      prevent exit() and quit from closing sys.stdin and raise
      SystemExit.
    - Change the behavior of tkinter.Text.count(). It now always
      returns an integer if one or less counting options are
      specified. Previously it could return a single count as a
      1-tuple, an integer (only if option "update" was specified)
      or None if no items found. The result is now the same if
      wantobjects is set to 0.
    - Switch the storage of the unicode codepoint names to
      use a different data-structure, a directed acyclic word
      graph. This makes the unicodedata shared library about 440
      KiB smaller. Contributed by Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick
      using code from the PyPy project.
    - Omit the interface scope from an IPv6 address when used as
      Host header by http.client.
    - zipinfo now supports the full range of values in the TZ
      string determined by RFC 8536 and detects all invalid
      formats. Both Python and C implementations now raise
      exceptions of the same type on invalid data.
  - Tests
    - Make the default value of test.support.infinite_recursion()
      to be conditional based on whether optimizations were used
      when compiling the interpreter. This helps with platforms
      like WASI whose stack size is greatly restricted in debug
      builds.
    - Gathering line coverage of standard libraries within the
      regression test suite is now precise, as well as much
      faster. Patch by Łukasz Langa.
    - Make regrtest --verbose3 option compatible with
      --huntrleaks -jN options. The ./python -m test -j1 -R 3:3
      --verbose3 command now works as expected. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - Remove no longer used functions run_unittest() and
      run_doctest() from the test.support module.
    - Fix regrtest if the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment
      variable is defined: use the variable value as the random
      seed. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - test_gdb: Fix detection of gdb built without Python
      scripting support. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Test case matching patterns specified by options --match,
      --ignore, --matchfile and --ignorefile are now tested in
      the order of specification, and the last match determines
      whether the test case be run or ignored.
    - Add unit test for usercustomize and sitecustomize hooks
      from site.
  - Build
    - Make make regen-unicodedata work for out-of-tree builds of
      CPython.
    - Add Tools/build/regen-configure.sh script to regenerate
      the configure with an Ubuntu container image. The
      quay.io/tiran/cpython_autoconf:271 container image
      (tiran/cpython_autoconf) is no longer used. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - For wasi-threads, memory is now exported to fix
      compatibility issues with some wasm runtimes.
    - AIX 32bit needs -latomic to build the _testcapi extension
      module.
    - The errno, md5, resource, winsound, _ctypes_test,
      _multiprocessing.posixshmem, _scproxy, _stat,
      _testimportmultiple and _uuid C extensions are now built
      with the limited C API. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - IDLE
    - Add docstrings to the IDLE debugger module. Fix two
      bugs: initialize Idb.botframe (should be in Bdb); in
      Idb.in_rpc_code, check whether prev_frame is None before
      trying to use it. Greatly expand test_debugger.
  - Tools/Demos
    - Argument Clinic now supports the @critical_section
      directive that instructs Argument Clinic to generate a
      critical section around the function call, which locks the
      self object in --disable-gil builds. Patch by Sam Gross.
  - C API
    - Add again the private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet()
      function as an alias to the new public
      PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() function. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - Restore the removed _PyDict_GetItemStringWithError()
      function. It is used by numpy. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Restore removed private C API functions, macros and
      structures which have no simple replacement for now:
        _PyDict_GetItem_KnownHash()
        _PyDict_NewPresized()
        _PyHASH_BITS
        _PyHASH_IMAG
        _PyHASH_INF
        _PyHASH_MODULUS
        _PyHASH_MULTIPLIER
        _PyLong_Copy()
        _PyLong_FromDigits()
        _PyLong_New()
        _PyLong_Sign()
        _PyObject_CallMethodId()
        _PyObject_CallMethodNoArgs()
        _PyObject_CallMethodOneArg()
        _PyObject_CallOneArg()
        _PyObject_EXTRA_INIT
        _PyObject_FastCallDict()
        _PyObject_GetAttrId()
        _PyObject_Vectorcall()
        _PyObject_VectorcallMethod()
        _PyStack_AsDict()
        _PyThread_CurrentFrames()
        _PyUnicodeWriter structure
        _PyUnicodeWriter_Dealloc()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_Finish()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_Init()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_Prepare()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_PrepareKind()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCIIString()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteLatin1String()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr()
        _PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring()
        _PyUnicode_AsString()
        _PyUnicode_FromId()
        _PyVectorcall_Function()
        _Py_IDENTIFIER()
        _Py_c_abs()
        _Py_c_diff()
        _Py_c_neg()
        _Py_c_pow()
        _Py_c_prod()
        _Py_c_quot()
        _Py_c_sum()
        _Py_static_string()
        _Py_static_string_init()
    - Add again <ctype.h> and <unistd.h> includes in Python.h,
      but don’t include them in the limited C API version 3.13
      and newer. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Add internal-only one-time initialization API: _PyOnceFlag
      and _PyOnceFlag_CallOnce.
    - Add PyDict_Pop() and PyDict_PopString() functions:
      remove a key from a dictionary and optionally return the
      removed value. This is similar to dict.pop(), but without
      the default value and not raising KeyError if the key
      missing. Patch by Stefan Behnel and Victor Stinner.
    - Rename Py_NOGIL to Py_GIL_DISABLED. Patch by Hugo van
      Kemenade.
    - Add PyList_Extend() and PyList_Clear() functions: similar
      to Python list.extend() and list.clear() methods. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - On Windows, Python.h no longer includes the <stddef.h>
      standard header file. If needed, it should now be included
      explicitly. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Implement “Python Critical Sections” from PEP 703. These
      are macros to help replace the GIL with per-object locks in
      the --disable-gil build of CPython. The macros are no-ops
      in the default build.
    - In the limited C API version 3.13, Py_SET_REFCNT() function
      is now implemented as an opaque function call. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - Add PyErr_FormatUnraisable() function.
    - Move the undocumented private _PyArg functions
      and _PyArg_Parser structure to internal C API
      (pycore_modsupport.h). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Support non-ASCII keyword names in
      PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords().
    - Introduced PyUnstable_PerfTrampoline_CompileCode(),
      PyUnstable_PerfTrampoline_SetPersistAfterFork() and
      PyUnstable_CopyPerfMapFile(). These functions allow
      extension modules to initialize trampolines eagerly, after
      the application is “warmed up”. This makes it possible to
      have perf-trampolines running in an always-enabled fashion.
    - Add the PySys_Audit() function to the limited C API. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - Add PyMem_RawMalloc(), PyMem_RawCalloc(),
      PyMem_RawRealloc() and PyMem_RawFree() to the limited C
      API. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - Functions PyDict_GetItem(), PyDict_GetItemString(),
      PyMapping_HasKey(), PyMapping_HasKeyString(),
      PyObject_HasAttr(), PyObject_HasAttrString(), and
      PySys_GetObject(), which clear all errors occurred
      during calling the function, report now them using
      sys.unraisablehook().
    - Remove redundant C-contiguity check in getargs.c, binascii,
      ssl and Argument Clinic. Patched by Stefan Krah and Furkan
      Onder
- Adjust patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - fix_configure_rst.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-test-posix_fadvise.patch

Fri Oct 13 17:35:43 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.13.0a1:
  * Allow the count argument of str.replace() to be a keyword. (Contributed by
    Hugo van Kemenade in gh-106487.)
  * Compiler now strip indents from docstrings. This will reduce the size of
    bytecode cache (e.g. .pyc file). For example, cache file size for
    sqlalchemy.orm.session in SQLAlchemy 2.0 is reduced by about 5%. This
    change will affect tools using docstrings, like doctest. (Contributed by
    Inada Naoki in gh-81283.)
  * The compile() built-in can now accept a new flag, ast.PyCF_OPTIMIZED_AST,
    which is similar to ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST except that the returned AST is
    optimized according to the value of the optimize argument. (Contributed by
    Irit Katriel in gh-108113).
  * multiprocessing, concurrent.futures, compileall: Replace os.cpu_count()
    with os.process_cpu_count() to select the default number of worker threads
    and processes. Get the CPU affinity if supported. (Contributed by Victor
    Stinner in gh-109649.)
  * os.path.realpath() now resolves MS-DOS style file names even if the file is
    not accessible. (Contributed by Moonsik Park in gh-82367.)

- Update to the final release of 3.12.0:
  Python 3.12 is the latest stable release of the Python
  programming language, with a mix of changes to the language and
  the standard library. The library changes focus on cleaning up
  deprecated APIs, usability, and correctness. Of note, the
  distutils package has been removed from the standard library.
  Filesystem support in os and pathlib has seen a number of
  improvements, and several modules have better performance.
  The language changes focus on usability, as f-strings have had
  many limitations removed and ‘Did you mean …’ suggestions
  continue to improve. The new type parameter syntax and type
  statement improve ergonomics for using generic types and type
  aliases with static type checkers.
  This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete
  specification of all new features, but instead gives
  a convenient overview. For full details, you should refer to
  the documentation, such as the Library Reference and Language
  Reference. If you want to understand the complete
  implementation and design rationale for a change, refer to the
  PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually
  are not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully
  implemented.
  - New syntax features:
      - PEP 695, type parameter syntax and the type statement
  - New grammar features:
      - PEP 701, f-strings in the grammar
  - Interpreter improvements:
      - PEP 684, a unique per-interpreter GIL
      - PEP 669, low impact monitoring
      - Improved ‘Did you mean …’ suggestions for NameError,
        ImportError, and SyntaxError exceptions
  - Python data model improvements:
      - PEP 688, using the buffer protocol from Python
  - Significant improvements in the standard library:
      - The pathlib.Path class now supports subclassing
      - The os module received several improvements for Windows
        support
      - A command-line interface has been added to the sqlite3
        module
      - isinstance() checks against runtime-checkable protocols
        enjoy a speed up of between two and 20 times
      - The asyncio package has had a number of performance
        improvements, with some benchmarks showing a 75% speed
        up.
      - A command-line interface has been added to the uuid
        module
      - Due to the changes in PEP 701, producing tokens via the
        tokenize module is up to up to 64% faster.
  - Security improvements:
      - Replace the builtin hashlib implementations of SHA1,
        SHA3, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, and MD5 with formally verified
        code from the HACL* project. These builtin
        implementations remain as fallbacks that are only used
        when OpenSSL does not provide them.
  - C API improvements:
      - PEP 697, unstable C API tier
      - PEP 683, immortal objects
  - CPython implementation improvements:
      - PEP 709, comprehension inlining
      - CPython support for the Linux perf profiler
      - Implement stack overflow protection on supported
        platforms
  - New typing features:
      - PEP 692, using TypedDict to annotate **kwargs
      - PEP 698, typing.override() decorator
  - Important deprecations, removals or restrictions:
      - PEP 623: Remove wstr from Unicode objects in Python’s
        C API, reducing the size of every str object by at least
        8 bytes.
      - PEP 632: Remove the distutils package. See the migration
        guide for advice replacing the APIs it provided. The
        third-party Setuptools package continues to provide
        distutils, if you still require it in Python 3.12 and
        beyond.
      - gh-95299: Do not pre-install setuptools in virtual
        environments created with venv. This means that
        distutils, setuptools, pkg_resources, and easy_install
        will no longer available by default; to access these run
        pip install setuptools in the activated virtual
        environment.
      - The asynchat, asyncore, and imp modules have been
        removed, along with several unittest.TestCase method
        aliases.
- Refresh bluez-devel-vendor.tar.xz from bluez-devel 5.69-1.1.

Wed Sep 20 07:14:17 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0rc3:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-109496: On a Python built in debug mode, Py_DECREF() now
      calls _Py_NegativeRefcount() if the object is a dangling pointer
      to deallocated memory: memory filled with 0xDD “dead byte” by
      the debug hook on memory allocators. The fix is to check the
      reference count before checking for _Py_IsImmortal(). Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109371: Deopted instructions correctly for tool
      initialization and modified the incorrect assertion in
      instrumentation, when a previous tool already sets INSTRUCTION
      events
    - gh-105658: Fix bug where the line trace of an except block
      ending with a conditional includes an excess event with the line
      of the conditional expression.
    - gh-109219: Fix compiling type param scopes that use a name which
      is also free in an inner scope.
    - gh-109341: Fix crash when compiling an invalid AST involving a
      ast.TypeAlias.
    - gh-109195: Fix source location for the LOAD_* instruction
      preceding a LOAD_SUPER_ATTR to load the super global (or
      shadowing variable) so that it encompasses only the name super
      and not the following parentheses.
    - gh-109118: Disallow nested scopes (lambdas, generator
      expressions, and comprehensions) within PEP 695 annotation
      scopes that are nested within classes.
    - gh-109114: Relax the detection of the error message for invalid
      lambdas inside f-strings to not search for arbitrary replacement
      fields to avoid false positives. Patch by Pablo Galindo
    - gh-109118: Fix interpreter crash when a NameError is raised
      inside the type parameters of a generic class.
    - gh-108976: Fix crash that occurs after de-instrumenting a code
      object in a monitoring callback.
    - gh-108732: Make iteration variables of module- and class-scoped
      comprehensions visible to pdb and other tools that use
      frame.f_locals again.
    - gh-108959: Fix caret placement for error locations for subscript
      and binary operations that involve non-semantic parentheses and
      spaces. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Library
    - gh-108682: Enum: require names=() or type=... to create an empty
      enum using the functional syntax.
    - gh-108843: Fix an issue in ast.unparse() when unparsing
      f-strings containing many quote types.
  - Documentation
    - gh-102823: Document the return type of x // y when x and y have
      type float.
  - Tests
    - gh-109396: Fix test_socket.test_hmac_sha1() in FIPS mode. Use a
      longer key: FIPS mode requires at least of at least 112 bits.
      The previous key was only 32 bits. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-104736: Fix test_gdb on Python built with LLVM clang 16 on
      Linux ppc64le (ex: Fedora 38). Search patterns in gdb “bt”
      command output to detect when gdb fails to retrieve the
      traceback. For example, skip a test if Backtrace stopped: frame
      did not save the PC is found. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109237: Fix test_site.test_underpth_basic() when the working
      directory contains at least one non-ASCII character: encode the
      ._pth file to UTF-8 and enable the UTF-8 Mode to use UTF-8 for
      the child process stdout. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109230: Fix test_pyexpat.test_exception(): it can now be run
      from a directory different than Python source code directory.
      Before, the test failed in this case. Skip the test if
      Modules/pyexpat.c source is not available. Skip also the test on
      Python implementations other than CPython. Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - gh-109015: Fix test_asyncio, test_imaplib and test_socket tests
      on FreeBSD if the TCP blackhole is enabled (sysctl
      net.inet.tcp.blackhole). Skip the few tests which failed with
      ETIMEDOUT which such non standard configuration. Currently, the
      FreeBSD GCP image enables TCP and UDP blackhole (sysctl
      net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 and sysctl net.inet.udp.blackhole=1).
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-91960: Skip test_gdb if gdb is unable to retrieve Python
      frame objects: if a frame is <optimized out>. When Python is
      built with “clang -Og”, gdb can fail to retrive the frame
      parameter of _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault(). In this case, tests
      like py_bt() are likely to fail. Without getting access to
      Python frames, python-gdb.py is mostly clueless on retrieving
      the Python traceback. Moreover, test_gdb is no longer skipped on
      macOS if Python is built with Clang. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108962: Skip test_tempfile.test_flags() if chflags() fails
      with “OSError: [Errno 45] Operation not supported” (ex: on
      FreeBSD 13). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108851: Fix test_tomllib recursion tests for WASI buildbots:
      reduce the recursion limit and compute the maximum nested
      array/dict depending on the current available recursion limit.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108851: Add get_recursion_available() and
      get_recursion_depth() functions to the test.support module.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: Add --fail-rerun option option to regrtest: if a test
      failed when then passed when rerun in verbose mode, exit the
      process with exit code 2 (error), instead of exit code 0
      (success). Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: Rename regrtest --verbose2 option (-w) to --rerun.
      Keep --verbose2 as a deprecated alias. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108834: When regrtest reruns failed tests in verbose mode
      (./python -m test --rerun), tests are now rerun in fresh worker
      processes rather than being executed in the main process. If a
      test does crash or is killed by a timeout, the main process can
      detect and handle the killed worker process. Tests are rerun in
      parallel if the -jN option is used to run tests in parallel.
      Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-103186: Suppress and assert expected RuntimeWarnings in
      test_sys_settrace.py
  - Build
    - gh-108740: Fix a race condition in make regen-all. The
      deepfreeze.c source and files generated by Argument Clinic are
      now generated or updated before generating “global objects”.
      Previously, some identifiers may miss depending on the order in
      which these files were generated. Patch by Victor Stinner.
- Python 3.12.0 release candidate 2:
  - Security
    - gh-108310: Fixed an issue where instances of ssl.SSLSocket were
      vulnerable to a bypass of the TLS handshake and included
      protections (like certificate verification) and treating sent
      unencrypted data as if it were post-handshake TLS encrypted
      data. Security issue reported as CVE-2023-40217 by Aapo Oksman.
      Patch by Gregory P. Smith.
    - gh-107774: PEP 669 specifies that
      sys.monitoring.register_callback will generate an audit event.
      Pre-releases of Python 3.12 did not generate the audit event.
      This is now fixed.
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-108520: Fix
      multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.__setstate__() to properly
      initialize multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx.
      This fixes a regression when passing a SemLock accross nested
      processes.
    - Rename multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.is_fork_ctx to
      multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx to avoid
      exposing it as public API.
    - gh-108654: Restore locals shadowed by an inlined comprehension
      if the comprehension raises an exception.
    - gh-108487: Change an assert that would cause a spurious crash in
      a devious case that should only trigger deoptimization.
    - gh-106176: Use a WeakValueDictionary to track the lists
      containing the modules each thread is currently importing. This
      helps avoid a reference leak from keeping the list around longer
      than necessary. Weakrefs are used as GC can’t interrupt the
      cleanup.
    - gh-107901: Fix missing line number on JUMP_BACKWARD at the end
      of a for loop.
    - gh-108390: Raise an exception when setting a non-local event
      (RAISE, EXCEPTION_HANDLED, etc.) in
      sys.monitoring.set_local_events.
    - Fixes crash when tracing in recursive calls to Python classes.
    - gh-91051: Fix abort / segfault when using all eight type watcher
      slots, on platforms where char is signed by default.
    - gh-107724: In pre-release versions of 3.12, up to rc1, the
      sys.monitoring callback function for the PY_THROW event was
      missing the third, exception argument. That is now fixed.
    - gh-107080: Trace refs builds (--with-trace-refs) were crashing
      when used with isolated subinterpreters. The problematic global
      state has been isolated to each interpreter. Other fixing the
      crashes, this change does not affect users.
    - gh-77377: Ensure that multiprocessing synchronization objects
      created in a fork context are not sent to a different process
      created in a spawn context. This changes a segfault into an
      actionable RuntimeError in the parent process.
  - Library
    - gh-108469: ast.unparse() now supports new f-string syntax
      introduced in Python 3.12. Note that the f-string quotes are
      reselected for simplicity under the new syntax. (Patch by Steven
      Sun)
    - gh-108682: Enum: raise TypeError if super().__new__() is called
      from a custom __new__.
    - gh-108295: Fix crashes related to use of weakrefs on
      typing.TypeVar.
    - gh-64662: Fix support for virtual tables in
      sqlite3.Connection.iterdump(). Patch by Aviv Palivoda.
    - gh-108111: Fix a regression introduced in gh-101251 for 3.12,
      resulting in an incorrect offset calculation in
      gzip.GzipFile.seek().
    - gh-105736: Harmonized the pure Python version of OrderedDict
      with the C version. Now, both versions set up their internal
      state in __new__. Formerly, the pure Python version did the set
      up in __init__.
    - gh-108083: Fix bugs in the constructor of sqlite3.Connection and
      sqlite3.Connection.close() where exceptions could be leaked.
      Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - gh-107963: Fix multiprocessing.set_forkserver_preload() to check
      the given list of modules names. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
    - gh-106242: Fixes os.path.normpath() to handle embedded null
      characters without truncating the path.
    - gh-107913: Fix possible losses of errno and winerror values in
      OSError exceptions if they were cleared or modified by the
      cleanup code before creating the exception object.
    - gh-107845: tarfile.data_filter() now takes the location of
      symlinks into account when determining their target, so it will
      no longer reject some valid tarballs with
      LinkOutsideDestinationError.
    - gh-107805: Fix signatures of module-level generated functions in
      turtle.
    - gh-107715: Fix doctest.DocTestFinder.find() in presence of class
      names with special characters. Patch by Gertjan van Zwieten.
    - gh-100814: Passing a callable object as an option value to a
      Tkinter image now raises the expected TclError instead of an
      AttributeError.
    - gh-106684: Close asyncio.StreamWriter when it is not closed by
      application leading to memory leaks. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - gh-107396: tarfiles; Fixed use before assignment of
      self.exception for gzip decompression
    - gh-106052: re module: fix the matching of possessive quantifiers
      in the case of a subpattern containing backtracking.
    - gh-100061: Fix a bug that causes wrong matches for regular
      expressions with possessive qualifier.
    - gh-99203: Restore following CPython <= 3.10.5 behavior of
      shutil.make_archive(): do not create an empty archive if
      root_dir is not a directory, and, in that case, raise
      FileNotFoundError or NotADirectoryError regardless of format
      choice. Beyond the brought-back behavior, the function may now
      also raise these exceptions in dry_run mode.
  - Documentation
    - gh-105052: Update timeit doc to specify that time in seconds is just the default.
  - Tests
    - gh-89392: Removed support of test_main() function in tests. They
      now always use normal unittest test runner.
    - gh-108388: Convert test_concurrent_futures to a package of 7
      sub-tests. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108388: Split test_multiprocessing_fork,
      test_multiprocessing_forkserver and test_multiprocessing_spawn
      into test packages. Each package is made of 4 sub-tests:
      processes, threads, manager and misc. It allows running more
      tests in parallel and so reduce the total test duration. Patch
      by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-105776: Fix test_cppext when the C compiler command -std=c11
      option: remove -std= options from the compiler command. Patch by
      Victor Stinner.
    - gh-107178: Add the C API test for functions in the Mapping
      Protocol, the Sequence Protocol and some functions in the Object
      Protocol.
  - Build
    - gh-63760: Fix Solaris build: no longer redefine the
      gethostname() function. Solaris defines the function since 2005.
      Patch by Victor Stinner, original patch by Jakub Kulík.
    - gh-107814: When calling find_python.bat with -q it did not
      properly silence the output of nuget. That is now fixed.
  - Windows
    - gh-107565: Update Windows build to use OpenSSL 3.0.10.
    - gh-106242: Fixes realpath() to behave consistently when passed a
      path containing an embedded null character on Windows. In strict
      mode, it now raises OSError instead of the unexpected
      ValueError, and in non-strict mode will make the path absolute.
    - gh-106844: Fix integer overflow and truncating by the null
      character in _winapi.LCMapStringEx() which affects
      ntpath.normcase().
  - macOS
    - gh-107565: Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 3.0.10.
  - Tools/Demos
    - gh-107565: Update multissltests and GitHub CI workflows to use
      OpenSSL 1.1.1v, 3.0.10, and 3.1.2.
    - gh-95065: Argument Clinic now supports overriding automatically
      generated signature by using directive @text_signature.
  - C API
    - gh-107916: C API functions PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename(),
      PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilename() and
      PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename() save now the error code
      before calling PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault().
    - gh-107915: Such C API functions as PyErr_SetString(),
      PyErr_Format(), PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename() and many others
      no longer crash or ignore errors if it failed to format the
      error message or decode the filename. Instead, they keep a
      corresponding error.
    - gh-107810: Improve DeprecationWarning for uses of PyType_Spec
      with metaclasses that have custom tp_new.

Mon Aug  7 07:31:27 UTC 2023 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Refresh all patches
- Drop Revert-gh105127-left-tests.patch, in upstream now
- Update to 3.12.0rc1:
  - Reverted the :mod:`email.utils` security improvement change
    released in 3.12beta4 that unintentionally caused
    :mod:`email.utils.getaddresses` to fail to parse email addresses
    with a comma in the quoted name field. See :gh:`106669`.
  - Start initializing ob_digit during creation of
    :c:type:`PyLongObject` objects. Patch by Illia Volochii.
  - Increase C recursion limit for functions other than the main
    interpreter from 800 to 1500. This should allow functions like
    list.__repr__ and json.dumps to handle all the inputs that they
    could prior to 3.12
  - Fix potential unaligned memory access on C APIs involving returned
    sequences of char * pointers within the :mod:`grp` and
    :mod:`socket` modules. These were revealed using a
    -fsaniziter=alignment build on ARM macOS. Patch by Christopher
    Chavez.
  - Add the exception as the third argument to PY_UNIND callbacks in
    sys.monitoring. This makes the PY_UNWIND callback consistent with
    the other exception hanlding callbacks.
  - Raise a ValueError when a monitoring callback funtion returns
    DISABLE for events that cannot be disabled locally.
  - Add a RERAISE event to sys.monitoring, which occurs when an
    exception is reraised, either explicitly by a plain raise
    statement, or implicitly in an except or finally block.
  - Unsupported modules now always fail to be imported.
  - Fix classmethod-style :func:`super` method calls (i.e., where the
    second argument to :func:`super`, or the implied second argument
    drawn from self/cls in the case of zero-arg super, is a type) when
    the target of the call is not a classmethod.
  - Python no longer crashes due an infrequent race when initialzing
    per-interpreter interned strings. The crash would manifest when
    the interpreter was finalized.
  - Python no longer crashes due to an infrequent race in setting
    Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding and Py_FileSystemDefaultEncodeErrors
    (both deprecated), when simultaneously initializing two isolated
    subinterpreters. Now they are only set during runtime
    initialization.
  - Fix a segmentation fault caused by a use-after-free bug in
    frame_dealloc when the trashcan delays the deallocation of a
    PyFrameObject.
  - No longer suppress arbitrary errors in the __annotations__ getter
    and setter in the type and module types.
  - Propagate frozen_modules to multiprocessing spawned process
    interpreters.
  - Prevent out-of-bounds memory access during mmap.find() calls.
  - Seems that in some conditions, OpenSSL will return
    SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL instead of SSL_ERROR_SSL when a certification
    verification has failed, but the error parameters will still
    contain ERR_LIB_SSL and SSL_R_CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED. We are
    now detecting this situation and raising the appropiate
    ssl.SSLCertVerificationError. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix :func:`types.get_original_bases` to only return
    :attr:`!__orig_bases__` if it is present on cls directly. Patch by
    James Hilton-Balfe.
  - Prevent memory leak and use-after-free when using pointers to
    pointers with ctypes
  - Make :func:`gettext.pgettext` search plural definitions when
    translation is not found.
  - Document behavior of :func:`shutil.disk_usage` for non-mounted
    filesystems on Unix.
  - Do not report MultipartInvariantViolationDefect defect when the
    :class:`email.parser.Parser` class is used to parse emails with
    headersonly=True.
  - Fix invalid result from :meth:`PurePath.relative_to` method when
    attempting to walk a ".." segment in other with walk_up enabled. A
    :exc:`ValueError` exception is now raised in this case.
  - Fix potential missing NULL check of d2i_SSL_SESSION result in
    _ssl.c.
  - Update the bundled copy of pip to version 23.2.1.
  - Fixed several bugs in zipfile.Path, including: in Path.match`,
    Windows separators are no longer honored (and never were meant to
    be); Fixed ``name/suffix/suffixes/stem operations when no filename
    is present and the Path is not at the root of the zipfile;
    Reworked glob for performance and more correct matching behavior.

Thu Aug  3 14:13:30 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- IT MEANS THAT bsc#1210638 STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!
- Add Revert-gh105127-left-tests.patch (gh#python/cpython!106941)
  partially reverting CVE-2023-27043-email-parsing-errors.patch,
  because of the regression in gh#python/cpython#106669.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 11 22:20:22 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0b4:
  - gh-issue-102988: CVE-2023-27043 (bsc#1210638): Prevent
    :func:`email.utils.parseaddr` and
    :func:`email.utils.getaddresses` from returning the realname
    portion of an invalid RFC2822 email header in the email
    address portion of the 2-tuple returned after being parsed by
    :class:`email._parseaddr.AddressList`.
  - gh-issue-106396: When the format specification of an
    f-string expression is empty, the parser now generates an
    empty :class:`ast.JoinedStr` node for it instead of an
    one-element :class:`ast.JoinedStr` with an empty string
    :class:`ast.Constant`.
  - gh-issue-106145: Make ``end_lineno`` and ``end_col_offset``
    required on ``type_param`` ast nodes.
  - gh-issue-105979: Fix crash in :func:`!_imp.get_frozen_object`
    due to improper exception handling.
  - gh-issue-98931: Ensure custom :exc:`SyntaxError` error
    messages are raised for invalid imports with multiple
    targets. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - gh-issue-105908: Fixed bug where :gh:`99111` breaks future
    import ``barry_as_FLUFL`` in the Python REPL.
  - gh-issue-105340: Include the comprehension iteration
    variable in ``locals()`` inside a module- or class-scope
    comprehension.
  - gh-issue-105486: Change the repr of ``ParamSpec`` list of
    args in ``types.GenericAlias``.
  - gh-issue-101006: Improve error handling when read
    :mod:`marshal` data.
  - gh-issue-106524: Fix crash in :func:`!_sre.template` with
    templates containing invalid group indices.
  - gh-issue-106510: Improve debug output for atomic groups in
    regular expressions.
  - gh-issue-106503: Fix ref cycle in
    :class:`!asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport` by removing
    ``_write_ready`` in ``close``.
  - gh-issue-105497: Fix flag mask inversion when unnamed flags
    exist.
  - gh-issue-90876: Prevent :mod:`multiprocessing.spawn` from
    failing to *import* in environments where ``sys.executable``
    is ``None``.  This regressed in 3.11 with the addition of
    support for path-like objects in multiprocessing.
  - gh-issue-106292: Check for an instance-dict
    cached value in the :meth:`__get__` method of
    :func:`functools.cached_property`. This better matches the
    pre-3.12 behavior and improves compatibility for users
    subclassing :func:`functools.cached_property` and adding a
    :meth:`__set__` method.
  - gh-issue-106330: Fix incorrect matching of empty paths in
    :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.match`. This bug was introduced in
    Python 3.12.0 beta 1.
  - gh-issue-102541: Make pydoc.doc catch bad module ImportError
    when output stream is not None.
  - gh-issue-106152: Added PY_THROW event hook for
    :mod:`cProfile` for generators
  - gh-issue-106075: Added `asyncio.taskgroups.__all__` to
    `asyncio.__all__` for export in star imports.
  - gh-issue-105987: Fix crash due to improper reference counting
    in :mod:`asyncio` eager task factory internal routines.
  - gh-issue-105974: Fix bug where a :class:`typing.Protocol`
    class that had one or more non-callable members would
    raise :exc:`TypeError` when :func:`issubclass` was called
    against it, even if it defined a custom ``__subclasshook__``
    method. The behaviour in Python 3.11 and lower -- which has
    now been restored -- was not to raise :exc:`TypeError` in
    these situations if a custom ``__subclasshook__`` method was
    defined. Patch by Alex Waygood.
  - gh-issue-96145: Reverted addition of ``json.AttrDict``.
  - gh-issue-105497: Fix flag inversion when alias/mask members
    exist.
  - gh-issue-104554: Add RTSPS scheme support in urllib.parse
  - gh-issue-94777: Fix hanging :mod:`multiprocessing`
    ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` when a child process crashes while
    data is being written in the call queue.
  - gh-issue-106232: Make timeit doc command lines compatible
    with Windows by using double quotes for arguments.  This
    works on linux and macOS also.
  - gh-issue-101634: When running the Python test suite with
    ``-jN`` option, if a worker stdout cannot be decoded from
    the locale encoding report a failed testn so the exitcode is
    non-zero. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - gh-issue-106118: Fix compilation for platforms without
    :data:`!O_CLOEXEC`. The issue was introduced with Python
    3.12b1 in :gh:`103295`. Patch by Erlend Aasland.
  - gh-issue-104692: Include ``commoninstall`` as a prerequisite
    for ``bininstall``
    This ensures that ``commoninstall`` is completed before
    ``bininstall`` is started when parallel builds are used (``make
    -j install``), and so the ``python3`` symlink is only installed
    after all standard library modules are installed.
  - gh-issue-106359: Argument Clinic now explicitly forbids
    "kwarg splats" in function calls used as annotations.
  - gh-issue-105227: The new :c:func:`PyType_GetDict` provides
    the dictionary for the given type object that is normally
    exposed by ``cls.__dict__``. Normally it's sufficient to
    use :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dict`, but for the static
    builtin types :c:member:`!tp_dict` is now always ``NULL``.
    :c:func:`!PyType_GetDict()` provides the correct dict object
    instead.

Wed Jun 28 19:59:03 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0b3:
  - gh-103142: The version of OpenSSL used in Windows and
    Mac installers has been upgraded to 1.1.1u to address
    CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-0465, CVE-2023-0466, CVE-2023-0464,
    as well as CVE-2023-0286, CVE-2022-4303, and CVE-2022-4303
    fixed previously in 1.1.1t (gh-101727).
  - gh-102153: urllib.parse.urlsplit() now strips leading C0
    control and space characters following the specification for
    URLs defined by WHATWG in response to CVE-2023-24329.
  - gh-99889: Fixed a security in flaw in uu.decode() that could
    allow for directory traversal based on the input if no
    out_file was specified.
  - gh-104049: Do not expose the local on-disk
    location in directory indexes produced by
    http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.
  - gh-103935: trace.__main__ now uses io.open_code() for files
    to be executed instead of raw open().
  - gh-102953: The extraction methods in tarfile, and
    shutil.unpack_archive(), have a new filter argument that
    allows limiting tar features than may be surprising or
    dangerous, such as creating files outside the destination
    directory. See Extraction filters for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 25 22:02:04 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.12.0a6:
  - Many new features for Python 3.12 are still being planned and
    written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:
    - Even more improved error messages. More exceptions
      potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the
      user.
    - Support for the Linux perf profiler to report Python
      function names in traces.
    - The deprecated wstr and wstr_length members of the C
      implementation of unicode objects were removed, per PEP
      623.
    - In the unittest module, a number of long deprecated methods
      and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since
      Python 3.1 or 3.2).
    - The deprecated smtpd and distutils modules have been
      removed (see PEP 594 and PEP 632. The setuptools package
      (installed by default in virtualenvs and many other places)
      continues to provide the distutils module.
    - A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions,
      classes and methods have been removed.
    - Invalid backslash escape sequences in strings now warn
      with SyntaxWarning instead of DeprecationWarning, making
      them more visible. (They will become syntax errors in the
      future.)
    - The internal representation of integers has changed in
      preparation for performance enhancements. (This should not
      affect most users as it is an internal detail, but it may
      cause problems for Cython-generated code.)
- Add the refreshed version of
  F00251-change-user-install-location.patch (updated from
  Fedora), which works together with the installation schemes in
  sysconfig.
- Remove distutils-reproducible-compile.patch, which is not
  applicable anymore (because distutils was removed from the
  standard library).
- Remove upstreamed support-expat-CVE-2022-25236-patched.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 14:59:50 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.1:
  - python -m http.server no longer allows terminal control
    characters sent within a garbage request to be printed
    to the stderr server lo This is done by changing the
    http.server BaseHTTPRequestHandler .log_message method to
    replace control characters with a \xHH hex escape before
    printin
  - Avoid publishing list of active per-interpreter audit hooks
    via the gc module
  - The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by socket or
    asyncio related name resolution functions no longer involves
    a quadratic algorithm. This prevents a potential CPU denial
    of service if an out-of-spec excessive length hostname
    involving bidirectional characters were decoded. Some
    protocols such as urllib http 3xx redirects potentially allow
    for an attacker to supply such a name (CVE-2022-45061).
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.5.0
  - Fix a shell code injection vulnerability in the
    get-remote-certificate.py example script. The script no
    longer uses a shell to run openssl commands. Issue reported
    and initial fix by Caleb Shortt. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fix a crash when an object which does not have a dictionary
    frees its instance values.
  - Fix a bug in the tokenizer that could cause infinite
    recursion when showing syntax warnings that happen in the
    first line of the source. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix an issue that could cause frames to be visible to Python
    code as they are being torn down, possibly leading to memory
    corruption or hard crashes of the interpreter.
  - Fix a reference bug in _imp.create_builtin() after the
    creation of the first sub-interpreter for modules builtins
    and sys. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing a buffer overflow if the
    tokenizer copies a line missing the newline caracter from a
    file that is as long as the available tokenizer buffer. Patch
    by Pablo galindo
  - Fix bug where an ExceptionGroup subclass can wrap a
    BaseException.
  - Fix zip path for venv created from a non-installed python on
    POSIX platforms.
  - Fix an issue that could potentially cause incorrect error
    handling for some bytecode instructions.
  - Fix an issue that prevented PyThreadState and
    PyInterpreterState memory from being freed properly.
  - Fix failure in except* with unhashable exceptions.
  - Fix calculation of sys._base_executable when inside a POSIX
    virtual environment using copies of the python binary when
    the base installation does not provide the executable name
    used by the venv. Calculation will fall back to alternative
    names (“python<MAJOR>”, “python<MAJOR>.<MINOR>”).
  - Update faulthandler to emit an error message with the proper
    unexpected signal number. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix location of SyntaxError for a try block with both except
    and except*.
  - Fix the error reporting positions of specialized traceback
    anchors when the source line contains Unicode characters.
  - Fix subscription of type aliases containing bare generic
    types or types like TypeVar: for example tuple[A, T][int] and
    tuple[TypeVar, T][int], where A is a generic type, and T is a
    type variable.
  - Lower the recursion depth for marshal on WASI to support
    wasmtime 2.0/main.
  - Fix multiple crashes in debug mode when str subclasses are
    used instead of str itself.
  - Fix an issue where member descriptors (such as those for
    __slots__) could behave incorrectly or crash instead of
    raising a TypeError when accessed via an instance of an
    invalid type.
  - Suppress ImportError for invalid query for help()
    command. Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix detection of MAC addresses for uuid on certain OSs. Patch
    by Chaim Sanders
  - Print exception class name instead of its string
    representation when raising errors from ctypes calls.
  - os.sched_yield() now release the GIL while calling
    sched_yield(2). Patch by Dong-hee Na.
  - Fix an issue that could delay the specialization of PRECALL
    instructions.
  - Bugfix: PyFunction_GetAnnotations() should return a borrowed
    reference. It was returning a new reference.
  - Ensure that all Python frame objects are backed by “complete”
    frames.
  - Fixed a missing incref/decref pair in
    Exception.__setstate__(). Patch by Ofey Chan.
  - Fix the Python path configuration used to initialized
    sys.path at Python startup. Paths are no longer encoded
    to UTF-8/strict to avoid encoding errors if it contains
    surrogate characters (bytes paths are decoded with the
    surrogateescape error handler). Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Fix overly-broad source position information for chained
    comparisons used as branching conditions.
  - At Python exit, sometimes a thread holding the GIL can
    wait forever for a thread (usually a daemon thread) which
    requested to drop the GIL, whereas the thread already
    exited. To fix the race condition, the thread which requested
    the GIL drop now resets its request before exiting. Issue
    discovered and analyzed by Mingliang ZHAO. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure, fatal error, or SystemError
    if a line tracing event raises an exception while opcode
    tracing is enabled.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in C code of null pointer arithmetic.
  - Make sure that all frame objects created are created from
    valid interpreter frames. Prevents the possibility of invalid
    frames in backtraces and signal handlers.
  - Disable incorrect pickling of the C implemented classmethod
    descriptors.
  - On WASI ENOTCAPABLE is now mapped to PermissionError. The
    errno modules exposes the new error number. getpath.py now
    ignores PermissionError when it cannot open landmark files
    pybuilddir.txt and pyenv.cfg.
  - Allow pdb to locate source for frozen modules in the standard
    library.
  - Raise ValueError instead of SystemError when methods of
    uninitialized io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder objects are
    called. Patch by Oren Milman.
  - Fix a possible assertion failure in io.FileIO when the opener
    returns an invalid file descriptor.
  - Also escape s in the http.server
    BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_message so that it is technically
    possible to parse the line and reconstruct what the original
    data was. Without this a xHH is ambiguious as to if it is a
    hex replacement we put in or the characters r”x” came through
    in the original request line.
  - asyncio.get_event_loop() now only emits a deprecation warning
    when a new event loop was created implicitly. It no longer
    emits a deprecation warning if the current event loop was
    set.
  - Fix bug when calling trace.CoverageResults with valid infile.
  - Fix a bug in handling class cleanups in
    unittest.TestCase. Now addClassCleanup() uses separate lists
    for different TestCase subclasses, and doClassCleanups() only
    cleans up the particular class.
  - Release the GIL when calling termios APIs to avoid blocking
    threads.
  - Fix ast.increment_lineno() to also cover ast.TypeIgnore when
    changing line numbers.
  - Fix bug in urllib.parse.urlparse() that causes URL schemes
    that begin with a digit, a plus sign, or a minus sign to be
    parsed incorrectly.
  - Check the number of arguments in substitution in user
    generics containing a TypeVarTuple and one or more TypeVar.
  - Fix substitution of ParamSpec followed by TypeVarTuple in
    generic aliases.
  - Fix substitution of TypeVarTuple and ParamSpec together in
    user generics.
  - Fixed bug where inspect.signature() reported incorrect
    arguments for decorated methods.
  - Fix SystemError in ctypes when exception was not set during
    __initsubclass__.
  - Remove older version of
    _SSLProtocolTransport.get_write_buffer_limits in
    asyncio.sslproto
  - fix negative numbers failing in verify()
  - Fix statistics.NormalDist pickle with 0 and 1 protocols.
  - enum.auto() is now correctly activated when combined with
    other assignment values. E.g. ONE = auto(), 'some text' will
    now evaluate as (1, 'some text').
  - Update the bundled copy of pip to version 22.3.1.
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in _zoneinfo
  - Clean up refleaks on failed module initialisation in in
    _pickle
  - Clean up refleak on failed module initialisation in _io.
  - Fix memory leak in math.dist() when both points don’t have
    the same dimension. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - [3.11] Applied changes from importlib_metadata 4.11.4
    through 4.13, including compatibility and robustness
    fixes for Distribution objects without _normalized_name,
    disallowing invalid inputs to Distribution.from_name, and
    refined behaviors in PathDistribution._name_from_stem and
    PathDistribution._normalized_name.
  - Fix argument typechecks in _overlapped.WSAConnect() and
    _overlapped.Overlapped.WSASendTo() functions.
  - Prevent crashing in traceback when retrieving the byte-offset
    for some source files that contain certain unicode
    characters.
  - Fix internal error in the re module which in very rare
    circumstances prevented compilation of a regular expression
    containing a conditional expression without the “else”
    branch.
  - Fix asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to call
    protocol.connection_lost callback only once on Windows.
  - Add a mutex to unittest.mock.NonCallableMock to protect
    concurrent access to mock attributes.
  - Fix hang on Windows in subprocess.wait_closed() in asyncio
    with ProactorEventLoop. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix infinite loop in unittest when a self-referencing chained
    exception is raised
  - tkinter.Text.count() raises now an exception for options
    starting with “-” instead of silently ignoring them.
  - On uname_result, restored expectation that _fields and
    _asdict would include all six properties including processor.
  - A createSocket() method was added to SysLogHandler.
  - Fix bug in urllib.parse.urlparse() that causes certain port
    numbers containing whitespace, underscores, plus and minus
    signs, or non-ASCII digits to be incorrectly accepted.
  - Allow venv to pass along PYTHON* variables to ensurepip and
    pip when they do not impact path resolution
  - On macOS, fix a crash in syslog.syslog() in multi-threaded
    applications. On macOS, the libc syslog() function is not
    thread-safe, so syslog.syslog() no longer releases the GIL to
    call it. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Allow BUILTINS to be a valid field name for frozen
    dataclasses.
  - Wrap network errors consistently in urllib FTP support, so
    the test suite doesn’t fail when a network is available but
    the public internet is not reachable.
  - Make sure patch.dict() can be applied on async functions.
  - Earlier in 3.11 we deprecated
    asyncio.Task.cancel("message"). We realized we were too
    harsh, and have undeprecated it.
  - Change deprecate warning message in unittest from It is
    deprecated to return a value!=None to It is deprecated to
    return a value that is not None from a test case
  - Fixes AttributeError when subprocess.check_output() is used
    with argument input=None and either of the arguments encoding
    or errors are used.
  - Fix is_private properties in the ipaddress module. Previously
    non-private networks (0.0.0.0/0) would return True from this
    method; now they correctly return False.
  - Avoid spurious tracebacks from asyncio when default executor
    cleanup is delayed until after the event loop is closed (e.g.
    as the result of a keyboard interrupt).
  - Avoid a crash in the C version of
    asyncio.Future.remove_done_callback() when an evil argument
    is passed.
  - Remove tokenize.NL check from tabnanny.
  - Fix generation of the default name of
    tkinter.Checkbutton. Previously, checkbuttons in different
    parent widgets could have the same short name and share
    the same state if arguments “name” and “variable” are not
    specified. Now they are globally unique.
  - Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.9
  - Fix race condition in asyncio where process_exited() called
    before the pipe_data_received() leading to inconsistent
    output. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fixed check in multiprocessing.resource_tracker that
    guarantees that the length of a write to a pipe is not
    greater than PIPE_BUF.
  - Corrected type annotation for dataclass attribute
    pstats.FunctionProfile.ncalls to be str.
  - Fix repr of Any subclasses.
  - Work around missing socket functions in socket’s __repr__.
  - In inspect, fix overeager replacement of “typing.” in
    formatting annotations.
  - Fix handling of bytes path-like objects in os.ismount().
  - Fix handling compiler warnings (SyntaxWarning and
    DeprecationWarning) in codeop.compile_command() when checking
    for incomplete input. Previously it emitted warnings and
    raised a SyntaxError. Now it always returns None for
    incomplete input without emitting any warnings.
  - To avoid apparent memory leaks when asyncio.open_connection()
    raises, break reference cycles generated by local exception
    and future instances (which has exception instance as its
    member var). Patch by Dong Uk, Kang.
  - Fixed flickering of the turtle window when the tracer is
    turned off. Patch by Shin-myoung-serp.
  - Fix asyncio subprocess transport to kill process cleanly
    when process is blocked and avoid RuntimeError when loop is
    closed. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Prevent error when activating venv in nested fish instances.
  - TarFile.next() now returns None when called on an empty
    tarfile.
  - Document the optional callback parameter of WeakMethod. Patch
    by Géry Ogam.
  - Restrict use of sockets instead of pipes for stdin of
    subprocesses created by asyncio to AIX platform only.
  - shutil.copytree() now applies the ignore_dangling_symlinks
    argument recursively.
  - Fix IndexError in argparse.ArgumentParser when a store_true
    action is given an explicit argument.
  - Document that calling variadic functions with ctypes requires
    special care on macOS/arm64 (and possibly other platforms).
  - Remove extra row
  - Clarified the conflicting advice given in the ast
    documentation about ast.literal_eval() being “safe” for use
    on untrusted input while at the same time warning that it
    can crash the process. The latter statement is true and is
    deemed unfixable without a large amount of work unsuitable
    for a bugfix. So we keep the warning and no longer claim that
    literal_eval is safe.
  - Restructured the documentation for the os.wait* family of
    functions, and improved the docs for os.waitid() with more
    explanation of the possible argument constants.
  - Skip test_normalization() of test_unicodedata if it
    fails to download NormalizationTest.txt file from
    pythontest.net. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correct test_marsh on (32 bit) x86: test_deterministic sets
    was failing.
  - Optional big memory tests in test_sqlite3 now catch the
    correct sqlite.DataError exception type in case of too large
    strings and/or blobs passed.
  - Fix a bug in the typing tests where a test relying
    on CPython-specific implementation details was not
    decorated with @cpython_only and was not skipped on other
    implementations.
  - Add tests for star-unpacking with PEP 646, and some other
    miscellaneous PEP 646 tests.
  - Added explicit coverage of Py_Initialize (and hence
    Py_InitializeEx) back to the embedding tests (all other
    embedding tests migrated to Py_InitializeFromConfig in Python
    3.11)
  - Some C API tests were moved into the new Lib/test/test_capi/
    directory.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int, -Wstrict-prototypes, and
    -Wimplicit-function-declaration compiler warnings in
    configure checks.
  - Fix a compilation issue with GCC 12 on macOS.
  - Fix -Wimplicit-int compiler warning in configure check for
    PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM.
  - Fix a possible fd leak in Programs/_freeze_module.c
    introduced in Python 3.11.
  - Fix build with PYTHON_FOR_REGEN=python3.8.
  - Specify the full path to the source location for make
    docclean (needed for cross-builds).
  - Don’t use vendored libmpdec headers if --with-system-libmpdec
    is passed to configure. Don’t use vendored libexpat headers
    if --with-system-expat is passed to !configure.
  - Fix the build process of clang compiler for _bootstrap_python
    if LTO optimization is applied. Patch by Matthias Görgens and
    Dong-hee Na.
  - wasm32-emscripten builds for browsers now include
    concurrent.futures for asyncio and unittest.mock.
  - wasm32-emscripten platform no longer builds resource module,
    getresuid(), getresgid(), and their setters. The APIs are
    stubs and not functional.
  - Updated pegen regeneration script on Windows to find and
    use Python 3.9 or higher. Prior to this, pegen regeneration
    already required 3.9 or higher, but the script may have used
    lower versions of Python.
  - Fix a bug in the previous bugfix that caused IDLE to
    not start when run with 3.10.8, 3.12.0a1, and at least
    Microsoft Python 3.10.2288.0 installed without the Lib/test
    package. 3.11.0 was never affected.
  - The wasm_build.py script now pre-builds Emscripten ports,
    checks for broken EMSDK versions, and warns about pkg-config
    env vars.
  - The new tool Tools/wasm/wasm_builder.py automates configure,
    compile, and test steps for building CPython on WebAssembly
    platforms.
  - Fix handling of module docstrings in Tools/i18n/pygettext.py.
  - PyBUF_* constants were marked as part of Limited API
    of Python 3.11+. These were available in 3.11.0 with
    Py_LIMITED_API defined for 3.11, and are necessary to use the
    buffer API.
  - Fix use-after-free in Py_SetPythonHome(NULL),
    Py_SetProgramName(NULL) and _Py_SetProgramFullPath(NULL)
    function calls. Issue reported by Benedikt Reinartz. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - Py_InitializeEx now correctly calls PyConfig_Clear after
    initializing the interpreter (the omission didn’t cause a
    memory leak only because none of the dynamically allocated
    config fields are populated by the wrapper function)
- Removed upstreamed patches:
  - 98437-sphinx.locale._-as-gettext-in-pyspecific.patch
  - CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 18:31:23 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add CVE-2022-45061-DoS-by-IDNA-decode.patch to avoid
  CVE-2022-45061 (bsc#1205244) allowing DoS by IDNA decoding
  extremely long domain names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 25 08:39:47 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0 (overall changes from 3.10.*):
  - General changes
    - PEP 657 -- Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in
      Tracebacks
    - PEP 654 -- Exception Groups and except*
    - PEP 680 -- tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the
      Standard Library
    - gh-90908 -- Introduce task groups to asyncio
    - gh-34627 -- Atomic grouping ((?>...)) and possessive
      quantifiers (*+, ++, ?+, {m,n}+) are now supported in
      regular expressions.
    - The Faster CPython Project is already yielding some
      exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than
      Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the
      standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for details.
  - Typing and typing language changes
    - PEP 673 -- Self Type
    - PEP 646 -- Variadic Generics
    - PEP 675 -- Arbitrary Literal String Type
    - PEP 655 -- Marking individual TypedDict items as required
      or potentially-missing
    - PEP 681 -- Data Class Transforms
- (just changes from 3.11.0rc2):
  - Fix multiplying a list by an integer (list *= int): detect
    the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close
    to the maximum size. Issue reported by Jordan Limor. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - On Linux the multiprocessing module returns to using
    filesystem backed unix domain sockets for communication
    with the forkserver process instead of the Linux abstract
    socket namespace. Only code that chooses to use the
    “forkserver” start method is affected. Abstract sockets have
    no permissions and could allow any user on the system in the
    same network namespace (often the whole system) to inject
    code into the multiprocessing forkserver process. This was
    a potential privilege escalation. Filesystem based socket
    permissions restrict this to the forkserver process user as
    was the default in Python 3.8 and earlier. This prevents
    Linux CVE-2022-42919.
  - Fix an issue where several frame objects could be backed by
    the same interpreter frame, possibly leading to corrupted
    memory and hard crashes of the interpreter.
  - Fix possible data corruption or crashes when accessing the
    f_back member of newly-created generator or coroutine frames.
  - Fix a crash occurring when PyEval_GetFrame() is called while
    the topmost Python frame is in a partially-initialized state.
  - Fix command line parsing: reject -X int_max_str_digits option
    with no value (invalid) when the PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS
    environment variable is set to a valid limit. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - Fix undefined behaviour in _testcapimodule.c.
  - When ValueError is raised if an integer is larger than the
    limit, mention the sys.set_int_max_str_digits() function in
    the error message. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correctly raise SyntaxError on exception groups (PEP 654) on
    python versions prior to 3.11
  - Document some places where an assignment expression needs
    parentheses.
  - Update the bundled copies of pip and setuptools to versions
    22.3 and 65.5.0 respectively.
  - fix Flag to use boundary CONFORM
  - This restores previous Flag behavior of allowing flags with
    non-sequential values to be combined; e.g.
  - class Skip(Flag): TWO = 2 EIGHT = 8
  - Skip.TWO | Skip.EIGHT -> <Skip.TWO|EIGHT: 10>
  - Fix ! in c domain ref target syntax via a conf.py patch, so
    it works as intended to disable ref target resolution.
  - Update tutorial introduction output to use 3.10+ SyntaxError
    invalid range.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 10:14:03 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Add 98437-sphinx.locale._-as-gettext-in-pyspecific.patch to
  allow building of documentation with the latest Sphinx 5.3.0
  (gh#python/cpython#98366).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 08:43:07 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0rc2:
  - Converting between int and str in bases other than 2
    (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base
    10 (decimal) now raises a ValueError if the number of digits
    in string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of
    service attacks due to the algorithmic complexity. This is
    a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735.
    This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment
    variable, command line flag, or sys APIs. See the integer
    string conversion length limitation documentation. The
    default limit is 4300 digits in string form.
  - Fix case of undefined behavior in ceval.c
  - Do not expose KeyWrapper in _functools.
  - Ensure that tracing, sys.setrace(), is turned on
    immediately. In pre-release versions of 3.11, some tracing
    events might have been lost when turning on tracing in a
    __del__ method or interrupt.
  - Fix use after free in trace refs build mode. Patch by Kumar
    Aditya.
  - When loading a file with invalid UTF-8 inside a multi-line
    string, a correct SyntaxError is emitted.
  - Make sure that incomplete frames do not show up in
    tracemalloc traces.
  - Remove two cases of undefined behavior, by adding NULL
    checks.
  - Fix possible NULL pointer dereference in
    _PyThread_CurrentFrames. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix AttributeError missing name and obj attributes in
    object.__getattribute__(). Patch by Philip Georgi.
  - Loading a file with invalid UTF-8 will now report the broken
    character at the correct location.
  - Fixed a bug that caused _PyCode_GetExtra to return garbage
    for negative indexes. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - Fix a deadlock in PyGILState_Ensure() when allocating new
    thread state. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - PyType_Ready() now initializes ht_cached_keys and performs
    additional checks to ensure that type objects are properly
    configured. This avoids crashes in 3rd party packages that
    don’t use regular API to create new types.
  - Skip over incomplete frames in PyThreadState_GetFrame().
  - Fix format string in _PyPegen_raise_error_known_location that
    can lead to memory corruption on some 64bit systems. The
    function was building a tuple with i (int) instead of n
    (Py_ssize_t) for Py_ssize_t arguments.
  - Fix misleading contents of error message when converting an
    all-whitespace string to float.
  - ast.parse() will no longer parse function definitions with
    positional-only params when passed feature_version less than
    (3, 8). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
  - Fix incorrect error message in the io module.
  - Fix the faulthandler implementation of
    faulthandler.register(signal, chain=True) if the sigaction()
    function is not available: don’t call the previous signal
    handler if it’s NULL. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - Correct conversion of numbers.Rational’s to float.
  - Fix TypeVarTuple.__typing_prepare_subst__. TypeError was not
    raised when using more than one TypeVarTuple, like [*T, *V]
    in type alias substitutions.
  - Fix asyncio.streams.StreamReaderProtocol to keep a strong
    reference to the created task, so that it’s not garbage
    collected
  - Fix a performance regression in logging
    TimedRotatingFileHandler. Only check for special files when
    the rollover time has passed.
  - Fix unused localName parameter in the Attr class in
    xml.dom.minidom.
  - Fix incorrect condition that causes sys.thread_info.name to
    be wrong on pthread platforms.
  - Remove an incompatible change from bpo-28080 that caused a
    regression that ignored the utf8 in ZipInfo.flag_bits. Patch
    by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix asyncio.Runner to call asyncio.set_event_loop() only
    once to avoid calling attach_loop() multiple times on child
    watchers. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to set event loop before
    calling setup functions. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - When a task catches asyncio.CancelledError and raises some
    other error, the other error should generally not silently be
    suppressed.
  - Fail gracefully if EPERM or ENOSYS is raised when loading
    crypt methods. This may happen when trying to load MD5 on a
    Linux kernel with FIPS enabled.
  - Allow asyncio.StreamWriter.drain() to be awaited concurrently
    by multiple tasks. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Fix ast.unparse() when ImportFrom.level is None
  - Improve discoverability of the higher level
    concurrent.futures module by providing clearer links from the
    lower level threading and multiprocessing modules.
  - What’s New 3.11 now has instructions for how to provide
    compiler and linker flags for Tcl/Tk and OpenSSL on RHEL 7
    and CentOS 7.
  - Mitigate the inherent race condition from using
    find_unused_port() in testSockName() by trying to find an
    unused port a few times before failing. Patch by Ross Burton.
  - Build and test with OpenSSL 1.1.1q
- Use support-expat-CVE-2022-25236-patched.patch from the current
  version of gh#python/cpython#93900 instead of the old
  support-expat-245.patch.
- Reapply fix_configure_rst.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 08:43:49 UTC 2022 - Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

- Increase testsuite timeout for test_freeze_simple_script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 21:31:40 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- fix import_failed.map to refer to the python 3.11 package versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 14:05:21 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0rc1:
  - Core and Builtins
    - Update code object hashing and equality to consider all
      debugging and exception handling tables. This fixes an
      issue where certain non-identical code objects could be
      “deduplicated” during compilation.
    - _PyPegen_Parser_New now properly detects token memory
      allocation errors. Patch by Honglin Zhu.
    - Run Python code in tracer/profiler function at full
      speed. Fixes slowdown in earlier versions of 3.11.
    - Emit a warning in debug mode if an object does not call
      PyObject_GC_UnTrack() before deallocation. Patch by Pablo
      Galindo.
    - Prevented crashes in the AST constructor when
      compiling some absurdly long expressions like
      "+0"*1000000. RecursionError is now raised instead. Patch
      by Pablo Galindo
    - ast.AST node positions are now validated when provided to
      compile() and other related functions. If invalid positions
      are detected, a ValueError will be raised.
    - Fix error detection in some builtin functions when keyword
      argument name is an instance of a str subclass with
      overloaded __eq__ and __hash__. Previously it could cause
      SystemError or other undesired behavior.
  - Library
    - Update bundled pip to 22.2.2.
    - Fix asyncio.TaskGroup to propagate exception when
      asyncio.CancelledError was replaced with another exception
      by a context manger. Patch by Kumar Aditya and Guido van
      Rossum.
    - Update bundled pip to 22.2.1.
    - Fix GC crash when deallocating _lsprof.Profiler by
      untracking it before calling any callbacks. Patch by Kumar
      Aditya.
    - Fix asyncio.run() for asyncio.Task implementations without
      uncancel() method. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix check for existence of os.EFD_CLOEXEC, os.EFD_NONBLOCK
      and os.EFD_SEMAPHORE flags on older kernel versions where
      these flags are not present. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
    - Fix concurrent.futures.Executor.map() to cancel the
      currently waiting on future on an error - e.g. TimeoutError
      or KeyboardInterrupt.
    - Ensure that timeouts scheduled with asyncio.Timeout that
      have already expired are delivered promptly.
    - Suppress writing an XML declaration in open files
      in ElementTree.write() with encoding='unicode' and
      xml_declaration=None.
    - Fix findtext in the xml module to only give an empty string
      when the text attribute is set to None.
  - Documentation
    - Fix stylesheet not working in Windows CHM htmlhelp docs
      and add warning that they are deprecated. Contributed by
      C.A.M. Gerlach.
    - Update library documentation with availability information
      on WebAssembly platforms wasm32-emscripten and wasm32-wasi.
    - Use consistent syntax for platform availability. The
      directive now supports a content body and emits a warning
      when it encounters an unknown platform.
    - Document a limitation in ThreadPoolExecutor where its exit
      handler is executed before any handlers in atexit.
  - Tests
    - Lib/test/test_asyncio/test_ssl.py exposed a bug in the
      macOS kernel where intense concurrent load on non-blocking
      sockets occasionally causes errno.ENOBUFS (“No buffer space
      available”) to be emitted. FB11063974 filed with Apple, in
      the mean time as a workaround buffer size used in tests on
      macOS is decreased to avoid intermittent failures. Patch by
      Fantix King.
    - Fix problem with test_ssl test_get_ciphers on systems that
      require perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers.
    - Add a regression test for re exponentional slowdown when
      using rjsmin.
  - Build
    - Fix a regression in configure script that caused some
      header checks to ignore custom CPPFLAGS. The regression was
      introduced in gh-94802.
    - wasm32-wasi builds no longer depend on WASIX’s pthread
      stubs. Python now has its own stubbed pthread API.
    - Python now detects missing dup function in WASI and works
      around some missing errno, select, and socket constants.
    - Python now skips missing socket functions and methods on
      WASI. WASI can only create sockets from existing fd /
      accept and has no netdb.
    - Platforms wasm32-unknown-emscripten and wasm32-unknown-wasi
      have been promoted to PEP 11 tier 3 platform support.
  - IDLE
    - Document handling of extensions in Save As dialogs.
    - Include prompts when saving Shell (interactive input and
      output).
    - Fix the Shell context menu copy-with-prompts bug of copying
      an extra line when one selects whole lines.
    - In the Edit menu, move Select All and add a new separator.
    - Enable using IDLE’s module browser with .pyw files.
    - Add .pyi as a recognized extension for IDLE on macOS. This
      allows opening stub files by double clicking on them in the
      Finder.
  - C API
    - Restore the 3.10 behavior for multiple inheritance of C
      extension classes that store their dictionary at the end of
      the struct.
    - Added PyCode_GetVarnames(), PyCode_GetCellvars() and
      PyCode_GetFreevars() for accessing co_varnames, co_cellvars
      and co_freevars respectively via the C API.

Tue Jul 26 10:37:31 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0b5:
  - Core and Builtins
    - gh-93351: ast.AST node positions are now validated when
      provided to compile() and other related functions. If
      invalid positions are detected, a ValueError will be
      raised.
    - gh-94438: Fix an issue that caused extended opcode
      arguments and some conditional pops to be ignored when
      calculating valid jump targets for assignments to the
      f_lineno attribute of frame objects. In some cases, this
      could cause inconsistent internal state, resulting in a
      hard crash of the interpreter.
    - gh-95060: Undocumented PyCode_Addr2Location function now
      properly returns when addrq argument is less than zero.
    - gh-95113: Replace all EXTENDED_ARG_QUICK instructions
      with basic EXTENDED_ARG instructions in unquickened
      code. Consumers of non-adaptive bytecode should be able to
      handle extended arguments the same way they were handled in
      CPython 3.10 and older.
    - gh-91409: Fix incorrect source location info caused by
      certain optimizations in the bytecode compiler.
    - gh-94036: Fix incorrect source location info for some
      multi-line attribute accesses and method calls.
    - gh-94739: Allow jumping within, out of, and across
      exception handlers in the debugger.
    - gh-94949: ast.parse() will no longer parse parenthesized
      context managers when passed feature_version less than (3,
      9). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-94947: ast.parse() will no longer parse assignment
      expressions when passed feature_version less than (3,
      8). Patch by Shantanu Jain.
    - gh-91256: Ensures the program name is known for help text
      during interpreter startup.
    - gh-94869: Fix the column offsets for some expressions in
      multi-line f-strings ast nodes. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
    - gh-94822: Fix an issue where lookups of metaclass
      descriptors may be ignored when an identically-named
      attribute also exists on the class itself.
    - gh-91153: Fix an issue where a bytearray item assignment
      could crash if it’s resized by the new value’s __index__()
      method.
    - gh-90699: Fix reference counting bug in
      bool.__repr__(). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - Library
    - gh-95087: Fix IndexError in parsing invalid date in the
      email module.
    - gh-95199: Upgrade bundled setuptools to 63.2.0.
    - gh-95194: Upgrade bundled pip to 22.2.
    - gh-95132: Fix a sqlite3 regression where *args and **kwds

- Switch from %primary_interpreter to prjconf-defined
  %primary_python (gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#127).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 14 15:37:35 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.11.0b4:
- Fixes many bugs and adds following more significant changes
- Security
  - gh-68966: The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject
    Coreunsafe text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into
    shell Corecommands. Instead of using such text, it will
    warn and act Coreas if a match was not found (or for test
    commands, as if the Coretest failed). and Builtins
  - gh-93516: Lazily create a table mapping bytecode offsets to
    line numbers to speed up calculation of line numbers when
    tracing.
  - gh-93461: importlib.invalidate_caches() now drops entries
    from sys.path_importer_cache with a relative path as
    name. This solves a caching issue when a process changes its
    current working directory.
  - FileFinder no longer inserts a dot in the path, e.g.
    /egg/./spam is now /egg/spam.
Library
  - gh-93896: Fix asyncio.run() and
    unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase to always the set event loop
    as it was done in Python 3.10 and earlier. Patch by Kumar
    Aditya.
  - gh-94101: Manual instantiation of ssl.SSLSession objects is
    no longer allowed as it lead to misconfigured instances that
    crashed the interpreter when attributes where accessed on
    them.
  - gh-83658: Make multiprocessing.Pool raise an exception if
    maxtasksperchild is not None or a positive int.
  - gh-61162: Clarify sqlite3 behavior when Using the connection
    as a context manager.
Tools/Demos
  - gh-94538: Fix Argument Clinic output to custom file
    destinations. Patch by Erlend E. Aasland.
C API
  - gh-93937: The following frame functions and type are now
    directly available with #include <Python.h>, it’s no longer
    needed to add #include <frameobject.h>:
        PyFrame_Check()
        PyFrame_GetBack()
        PyFrame_GetBuiltins()
        PyFrame_GetGenerator()
        PyFrame_GetGlobals()
        PyFrame_GetLasti()
        PyFrame_GetLocals()
        PyFrame_Type

  - The Faster Cpython Project is already yielding some exciting
    results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python
    3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard
    benchmark suite. See
    https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython
    for details.

    re-entering.
  - bpo-42369: Fix thread safety of zipfile._SharedFile.tell() to
    avoid a “zipfile.BadZipFile: Bad CRC-32 for file” exception
    when reading a ZipFile from multiple threads.
  - bpo-38256: Fix binascii.crc32() when it is compiled to use
    zlib’c crc32 to work properly on inputs 4+GiB in length
    instead of returning the wrong result. The workaround prior
    to this was to always feed the function data in increments
    smaller than 4GiB or to just call the zlib module function.
  - bpo-39394: A warning about inline flags not at the start of
    the regular expression now contains the position of the flag.
  - bpo-47061: Deprecate the various modules listed by PEP 594:
  - aifc, asynchat, asyncore, audioop, cgi, cgitb, chunk, crypt,
    imghdr, msilib, nntplib, nis, ossaudiodev, pipes, smtpd,
    sndhdr, spwd, sunau, telnetlib, uu, xdrlib
  - bpo-2604: Fix bug where doctests using globals would fail
    when run multiple times.
  - bpo-45997: Fix asyncio.Semaphore re-aquiring FIFO order.
  - bpo-47022: The asynchat, asyncore and smtpd modules have been
    deprecated since at least Python 3.6. Their documentation and
    deprecation warnings and have now been updated to note they
    will removed in Python 3.12 (PEP 594).
  - bpo-46421: Fix a unittest issue where if the command was
    invoked as python -m unittest and the filename(s) began with
    a dot (.), a ValueError is returned.
  - bpo-40296: Fix supporting generic aliases in pydoc.

- Update to 3.10.3:
  - bpo-46940: Avoid overriding AttributeError metadata
    information for nested attribute access calls. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo-46852: Rename the private undocumented
    float.__set_format__() method to float.__setformat__() to fix
    a typo introduced in Python 3.7. The method is only used by
    test_float. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46794: Bump up the libexpat version into 2.4.6
  - bpo-46820: Fix parsing a numeric literal immediately (without
    spaces) followed by “not in” keywords, like in 1not in x. Now
    the parser only emits a warning, not a syntax error.
  - bpo-46762: Fix an assert failure in debug builds when a ‘<’,
    ‘>’, or ‘=’ is the last character in an f-string that’s
    missing a closing right brace.
  - bpo-46724: Make sure that all backwards jumps use the
    JUMP_ABSOLUTE instruction, rather than JUMP_FORWARD with an
    argument of (2**32)+offset.
  - bpo-46732: Correct the docstring for the __bool__() method.
    Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - bpo-46707: Avoid potential exponential backtracking when
    producing some syntax errors involving lots of brackets.
    Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-40479: Add a missing call to va_end() in
    Modules/_hashopenssl.c.
  - bpo-46615: When iterating over sets internally in
    setobject.c, acquire strong references to the resulting items
    from the set. This prevents crashes in corner-cases of
    various set operations where the set gets mutated.
  - bpo-45773: Remove two invalid “peephole” optimizations from
    the bytecode compiler.
  - bpo-43721: Fix docstrings of getter, setter, and deleter to
    clarify that they create a new copy of the property.
  - bpo-46503: Fix an assert when parsing some invalid N escape
    sequences in f-strings.
  - bpo-46417: Fix a race condition on setting a type __bases__
    attribute: the internal function add_subclass() now gets the
    PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses member after calling
    PyWeakref_NewRef() which can trigger a garbage collection
    which can indirectly modify PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46383: Fix invalid signature of _zoneinfo’s module_free
    function to resolve a crash on wasm32-emscripten platform.
  - bpo-46070: Py_EndInterpreter() now explicitly untracks all
    objects currently tracked by the GC. Previously, if an object
    was used later by another interpreter, calling
    PyObject_GC_UnTrack() on the object crashed if the previous
    or the next object of the PyGC_Head structure became
    a dangling pointer. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46339: Fix a crash in the parser when retrieving the
    error text for multi-line f-strings expressions that do not
    start in the first line of the string. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-46240: Correct the error message for unclosed parentheses
    when the tokenizer doesn’t reach the end of the source when
    the error is reported. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-46091: Correctly calculate indentation levels for lines
    with whitespace character that are ended by line continuation
    characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo
  - bpo-43253: Fix a crash when closing transports where the
    underlying socket handle is already invalid on the Proactor
    event loop.
  - bpo-47004: Apply bugfixes from importlib_metadata 4.11.3,
    including bugfix for EntryPoint.extras, which was returning
    match objects and not the extras strings.
  - bpo-46985: Upgrade pip wheel bundled with ensurepip (pip
    22.0.4)
  - bpo-46968: faulthandler: On Linux 5.14 and newer, dynamically
    determine size of signal handler stack size CPython allocates
    using getauxval(AT_MINSIGSTKSZ). This changes allows for
    Python extension’s request to Linux kernel to use AMX_TILE
    instruction set on Sapphire Rapids Xeon processor to succeed,
    unblocking use of the ISA in frameworks.
  - bpo-46955: Expose asyncio.base_events.Server as
    asyncio.Server. Patch by Stefan Zabka.
  - bpo-23325: The signal module no longer assumes that SIG_IGN
    and SIG_DFL are small int singletons.
  - bpo-46932: Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.7
  - bpo-25707: Fixed a file leak in

    dynamically loaded or statically linked libexpat in embedded
    Python.
  - bpo-39327: shutil.rmtree() can now work with VirtualBox
    shared folders when running from the guest operating-system.
  - bpo-46756: Fix a bug in
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password() and
    urllib.request.HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth.is_authenticated()
    which allowed to bypass authorization. For example, access to
    URI example.org/foobar was allowed if the user was authorized
    for URI example.org/foo.
  - bpo-46643: In typing.get_type_hints(), support evaluating
    stringified ParamSpecArgs and ParamSpecKwargs annotations.
    Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-45863: When the tarfile module creates a pax format
    archive, it will put an integer representation of timestamps
    in the ustar header (if possible) for the benefit of older
    unarchivers, in addition to the existing full-precision
    timestamps in the pax extended header.
  - bpo-46676: Make typing.ParamSpec args and kwargs equal to
    themselves. Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46672: Fix NameError in asyncio.gather() when initial
    type check fails.
  - bpo-46655: In typing.get_type_hints(), support evaluating
    bare stringified TypeAlias annotations. Patch by Gregory
    Beauregard.
  - bpo-45948: Fixed a discrepancy in the C implementation of the
    xml.etree.ElementTree module. Now, instantiating an
    xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser with a target=None keyword
    provides a default xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder target
    as the Python implementation does.
  - bpo-46521: Fix a bug in the codeop module that was
    incorrectly identifying invalid code involving string quotes
    as valid code.
  - bpo-46581: Brings ParamSpec propagation for GenericAlias in
    line with Concatenate (and others).
  - bpo-46591: Make the IDLE doc URL on the About IDLE dialog
    clickable.
  - bpo-46400: expat: Update libexpat from 2.4.1 to 2.4.4
  - bpo-46487: Add the get_write_buffer_limits method to
    asyncio.transports.WriteTransport and to the SSL transport.
  - bpo-45173: Note the configparser deprecations will be removed
    in Python 3.12.

    stringified ClassVar and Final annotations inside Annotated.
    Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46491: Allow typing.Annotated to wrap typing.Final and
    typing.ClassVar. Patch by Gregory Beauregard.
  - bpo-46436: Fix command-line option -d/--directory in module
    http.server which is ignored when combined with command-line
    option --cgi. Patch by Géry Ogam.
  - bpo-41403: Make mock.patch() raise a TypeError with
    a relevant error message on invalid arg. Previously it
    allowed a cryptic AttributeError to escape.
  - bpo-46474: In importlib.metadata.EntryPoint.pattern, avoid
    potential REDoS by limiting ambiguity in consecutive
    whitespace.
  - bpo-46469: asyncio generic classes now return
    types.GenericAlias in __class_getitem__ instead of the same
    class.
  - bpo-46434: pdb now gracefully handles help when __doc__ is
    missing, for example when run with pregenerated optimized
    .pyc files.
  - bpo-46333: The __eq__() and __hash__() methods of
    typing.ForwardRef now honor the module parameter of
    typing.ForwardRef. Forward references from different modules
    are now differentiated.
  - bpo-46246: Add missing __slots__ to
    importlib.metadata.DeprecatedList. Patch by Arie Bovenberg.
  - bpo-46266: Improve day constants in calendar.
  - Now all constants (MONDAY … SUNDAY) are documented, tested,
    and added to __all__.
  - bpo-46232: The ssl module now handles certificates with bit
    strings in DN correctly.
  - bpo-43118: Fix a bug in inspect.signature() that was causing
    it to fail on some subclasses of classes with
    a __text_signature__ referencing module globals. Patch by
    Weipeng Hong.
  - bpo-26552: Fixed case where failing asyncio.ensure_future()
    did not close the coroutine. Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - bpo-21987: Fix an issue with tarfile.TarFile.getmember()
    getting a directory name with a trailing slash.
  - bpo-20392: Fix inconsistency with uppercase file extensions
    in MimeTypes.guess_type(). Patch by Kumar Aditya.
  - bpo-46080: Fix exception in argparse help text generation if
    a argparse.BooleanOptionalAction argument’s default is
    argparse.SUPPRESS and it has help specified. Patch by Felix
    Fontein.
  - bpo-44439: Fix .write() method of a member file in ZipFile,
    when the input data is an object that supports the buffer
    protocol, the file length may be wrong.
  - bpo-45703: When a namespace package is imported before
    another module from the same namespace is created/installed
    in a different sys.path location while the program is
    running, calling the importlib.invalidate_caches() function
    will now also guarantee the new module is noticed.
  - bpo-24959: Fix bug where unittest sometimes drops frames from
    tracebacks of exceptions raised in tests.
  - bpo-44791: Fix substitution of ParamSpec in Concatenate with
    different parameter expressions. Substitution with a list of
    types returns now a tuple of types. Substitution with
    Concatenate returns now a Concatenate with concatenated lists
    of arguments.
  - bpo-14156: argparse.FileType now supports an argument of ‘-’
    in binary mode, returning the .buffer attribute of
    sys.stdin/sys.stdout as appropriate. Modes including ‘x’ and
    ‘a’ are treated equivalently to ‘w’ when argument is ‘-’.
    Patch contributed by Josh Rosenberg
  - bpo-46463: Fixes escape4chm.py script used when building the
    CHM documentation file
  - bpo-46913: Fix test_faulthandler.test_sigfpe() if Python is

    Stinner.
  - bpo-46708: Prevent default asyncio event loop policy
    modification warning after test_asyncio execution.
  - bpo-46678: The function make_legacy_pyc in
    Lib/test/support/import_helper.py no longer fails when
    PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX is set to a directory on a different
    device from where tempfiles are stored.
  - bpo-46616: Ensures test_importlib.test_windows cleans up
    registry keys after completion.
  - bpo-44359: test_ftplib now silently ignores socket errors to
    prevent logging unhandled threading exceptions. Patch by
    Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46542: Fix a Python crash in test_lib2to3 when using
    Python built in debug mode: limit the recursion limit. Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-46576: test_peg_generator now disables compiler
    optimization when testing compilation of its own C extensions
    to significantly speed up the testing on non-debug builds of
    CPython.
  - bpo-46542: Fix test_json tests checking for RecursionError:
    modify these tests to use support.infinite_recursion(). Patch
    by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo-13886: Skip test_builtin PTY tests on non-ASCII
    characters if the readline module is loaded. The readline
    module changes input() behavior, but test_builtin is not
    intented to test the readline module. Patch by Victor
    Stinner.
  - bpo-38472: Fix GCC detection in setup.py when
    cross-compiling. The C compiler is now run with LC_ALL=C.
    Previously, the detection failed with a German locale.
  - bpo-46513: configure no longer uses AC_C_CHAR_UNSIGNED macro
    and pyconfig.h no longer defines reserved symbol
    __CHAR_UNSIGNED__.
  - bpo-45296: Clarify close, quit, and exit in IDLE. In the File
    menu, ‘Close’ and ‘Exit’ are now ‘Close Window’ (the current
    one) and ‘Exit’ is now ‘Exit IDLE’ (by closing all windows).
    In Shell, ‘quit()’ and ‘exit()’ mean ‘close Shell’. If there
    are no other windows, this also exits IDLE.
  - bpo-45447: Apply IDLE syntax highlighting to pyi files. Patch
    by Alex Waygood and Terry Jan Reedy.
  - bpo-46433: The internal function _PyType_GetModuleByDef now
    correctly handles inheritance patterns involving static
    types.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 08:52:47 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire rpm-build-python: The provider to inject python(abi)
  has been moved there. rpm-build pulls rpm-build-python
  automatically in when building anything against python3-base, but
  this implies that the initial build of python3-base does not
  trigger the automatic installation.

- Update to 3.9.5:
  * Security
    - bpo-43434: Creating a sqlite3.Connection object now also
      produces a sqlite3.connect auditing event. Previously this
      event was only produced by sqlite3.connect() calls. Patch
      by Erlend E. Aasland.
    - bpo-43882: The presence of newline or tab characters in
      parts of a URL could allow some forms of attacks.
    - Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by
      WHATWG urllib.parse() now removes ASCII newlines and tabs
      from URLs, preventing such attacks.
    - bpo-43472: Ensures interpreter-level audit hooks receive
      the cpython.PyInterpreterState_New event when called
      through the _xxsubinterpreters module.
    - bpo-36384: ipaddress module no longer accepts any leading
      zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous
      and interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For
      example the legacy function socket.inet_aton() treats
      leading zeros as octal notatation. glibc implementation of
      modern inet_pton() does not accept any leading zeros. For
      a while the ipaddress module used to accept ambiguous
      leading zeros.
    - bpo-43075: Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
      vulnerability in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler.
      The ReDoS-vulnerable regex has quadratic worst-case
      complexity and it allows cause a denial of service when
      identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on
      the client side and needs remote attackers to control the
      HTTP server.
    - bpo-42800: Audit hooks are now fired for frame.f_code,
      traceback.tb_frame, and generator code/frame attribute
      access.
  * Core and Builtins
    - bpo-43105: Importlib now resolves relative paths when
      creating module spec objects from file locations.
    - bpo-42924: Fix bytearray repetition incorrectly copying
      data from the start of the buffer, even if the data is
      offset within the buffer (e.g. after reassigning a slice at
      the start of the bytearray to a shorter byte string).
  * Library
    - bpo-43993: Update bundled pip to 21.1.1.
    - bpo-43937: Fixed the turtle module working with non-default
      root window.
    - bpo-43930: Update bundled pip to 21.1 and setuptools to
      56.0.0
    - bpo-43920: OpenSSL 3.0.0: load_verify_locations() now
      returns a consistent error message when cadata contains no
      valid certificate.
    - bpo-43607: urllib can now convert Windows paths with \\?\
      prefixes into URL paths.
    - bpo-43284: platform.win32_ver derives the windows version
      from sys.getwindowsversion().platform_version which in turn
      derives the version from kernel32.dll (which can be of
      a different version than Windows itself). Therefore change
      the platform.win32_ver to determine the version using the
      platform module’s _syscmd_ver private function to return an
      accurate version.
    - bpo-42248: [Enum] ensure exceptions raised in _missing__
      are released
    - bpo-43799: OpenSSL 3.0.0: define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT 1.1.1
      to suppress deprecation warnings. Python requires OpenSSL
      1.1.1 APIs.
    - bpo-43794: Add ssl.OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF constants
      (OpenSSL 3.0.0)
    - bpo-43789: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Don’t call the password callback
      function a second time when first call has signaled an
      error condition.
    - bpo-43788: The header files for ssl error codes are now
      OpenSSL version-specific. Exceptions will now show correct
      reason and library codes. The make_ssl_data.py script has
      been rewritten to use OpenSSL’s text file with error codes.
    - bpo-43655: tkinter dialog windows are now recognized as
      dialogs by window managers on macOS and X Window.
    - bpo-43534: turtle.textinput() and turtle.numinput() create
      now a transient window working on behalf of the canvas
      window.
    - bpo-43522: Fix problem with hostname_checks_common_name.
      OpenSSL does not copy hostflags from struct SSL_CTX to
      struct SSL.
    - bpo-42967: Allow bytes separator argument in
      urllib.parse.parse_qs and urllib.parse.parse_qsl when
      parsing str query strings. Previously, this raised
      a TypeError.
    - bpo-43176: Fixed processing of a dataclass that inherits
      from a frozen dataclass with no fields. It is now correctly
      detected as an error.
    - bpo-41735: Fix thread locks in zlib module may go wrong in
      rare case. Patch by Ma Lin.
    - bpo-36470: Fix dataclasses with InitVars and replace().
      Patch by Claudiu Popa.
    - bpo-32745: Fix a regression in the handling of ctypes’
      ctypes.c_wchar_p type: embedded null characters would cause
      a ValueError to be raised. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
  * Documentation
    - bpo-43959: The documentation on the PyContextVar C-API was
      clarified.
    - bpo-43938: Update dataclasses documentation to express that
      FrozenInstanceError is derived from AttributeError.
    - bpo-43755: Update documentation to reflect that
      unparenthesized lambda expressions can no longer be the
      expression part in an if clause in comprehensions and
      generator expressions since Python 3.9.
    - bpo-43739: Fixing the example code in
      Doc/extending/extending.rst to declare and initialize the
      pmodule variable to be of the right type.
  * Tests
    - bpo-43961: Fix
      test_logging.test_namer_rotator_inheritance() on Windows:
      use os.replace() rather than os.rename(). Patch by Victor
      Stinner.
    - bpo-43842: Fix a race condition in the SMTP test of
      test_logging. Don’t close a file descriptor (socket) from
      a different thread while asyncore.loop() is polling the
      file descriptor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - bpo-43811: Tests multiple OpenSSL versions on GitHub
      Actions. Use ccache to speed up testing.
    - bpo-43791: OpenSSL 3.0.0: Disable testing of legacy
      protocols TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Tests are failing with
      TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR.
- Refreshed patches:
  - bpo-31046_ensurepip_honours_prefix.patch
  - python-3.3.0b1-fix_date_time_compiler.patch
- Add vendorized files from bluez-devel to enable building support for
  Bluetooth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 28 16:39:54 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.4:
  - bpo#43710: Reverted the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue42500
    as it changed the PyThreadState struct size and broke the 3.9.x ABI
    in the 3.9.3 release (visible on 32-bit platforms using binaries
    compiled using an earlier version of Python 3.9.x headers).
  - bpo#26053: Fixed bug where the pdb interactive run command echoed
    the args from the shell command line, even if those have been
    overridden at the pdb prompt.
  - bpo#42988 (bsc#1183374) CVE-2021-3426: Remove the getfile
    feature of the pydoc module which could be abused to read
    arbitrary files on the disk (directory traversal
    vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of Python modules
    can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
    reported by David Schwörer.
  - bpo#43285: ftplib no longer trusts the IP address value
    returned from the server in response to the PASV command by
    default. This prevents a malicious FTP server from using the
    response to probe IPv4 address and port combinations on the
    client network. Code that requires the former vulnerable
    behavior may set a trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address attribute
    on their ftplib.FTP instances to True to re-enable it.
  - bpo#43439: Add audit hooks for gc.get_objects(),
    gc.get_referrers() and gc.get_referents(). Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - bpo#43660: Fix crash that happens when replacing sys.stderr
    with a callable that can remove the object while an exception
    is being printed. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43555: Report the column offset for SyntaxError for
    invalid line continuation characters. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo#43517: Fix misdetection of circular imports when using
    from pkg.mod import attr, which caused false positives in
    non-trivial multi-threaded code.
  - bpo#35883: Python no longer fails at startup with a fatal
    error if a command line argument contains an invalid Unicode
    character. The Py_DecodeLocale() function now escapes byte
    sequences which would be decoded as Unicode characters
    outside the [U+0000; U+10ffff] range.
  - bpo#43406: Fix a possible race condition where
    PyErr_CheckSignals tries to execute a non-Python signal
    handler.
  - bpo#42500: Improve handling of exceptions near recursion
    limit. Converts a number of Fatal Errors in RecursionErrors.
  - bpo#43433: xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy no longer ignores query
    and fragment in the URL of the server.
  - bpo#35930: Raising an exception raised in a “future” instance
    will create reference cycles.
  - bpo#43577: Fix deadlock when using ssl.SSLContext debug
    callback with ssl.SSLContext.sni_callback().
  - bpo#43521: ast.unparse can now render NaNs and empty sets.
  - bpo#43423: subprocess.communicate() no longer raises an
    IndexError when there is an empty stdout or stderr IO buffer
    during a timeout on Windows.
  - bpo#27820: Fixed long-standing bug of smtplib.SMTP where
    doing AUTH LOGIN with initial_response_ok=False will fail.
    The cause is that SMTP.auth_login _always_ returns a password
    if provided with a challenge string, thus non-compliant with
    the standard for AUTH LOGIN. Also fixes bug with the test for
    smtpd.
  - bpo#43332: Improves the networking efficiency of http.client
    when using a proxy via set_tunnel(). Fewer small send calls
    are made during connection setup.
  - bpo#43399: Fix ElementTree.extend not working on iterators
    when using the Python implementation
  - bpo#43316: The python -m gzip command line application now
    properly fails when detecting an unsupported extension. It
    exits with a non-zero exit code and prints an error message
    to stderr.
  - bpo#43260: Fix TextIOWrapper can not flush internal buffer
    forever after very large text is written.
  - bpo#42782: Fail fast in shutil.move() to avoid creating
    destination directories on failure.
  - bpo#37193: Fixed memory leak in socketserver.ThreadingMixIn
    introduced in Python 3.7.
  - bpo#43199: Answer “Why is there no goto?” in the Design and
    History FAQ.
  - bpo#43407: Clarified that a result from time.monotonic(),
    time.perf_counter(), time.process_time(), or
    time.thread_time() can be compared with the result from any
    following call to the same function - not just the next
    immediate call.
  - bpo#27646: Clarify that ‘yield from <expr>’ works with any
    iterable, not just iterators.
  - bpo#36346: Update some deprecated unicode APIs which are
    documented as “will be removed in 4.0” to “3.12”. See PEP 623
    for detail.
  - bpo#37945: Fix test_getsetlocale_issue1813() of test_locale:
    skip the test if setlocale() fails. Patch by Victor Stinner.
  - bpo#41561: Add workaround for Ubuntu’s custom OpenSSL
    security level policy.
  - bpo#43288: Fix test_importlib to correctly skip Unicode file
    tests if the fileystem does not support them.
  - bpo#43617: Improve configure.ac: Check for presence of
    autoconf-archive package and remove our copies of M4 macros.
  - bpo#42225: Document that IDLE can fail on Unix either from
    misconfigured IP masquerage rules or failure displaying
    complex colored (non-ascii) characters.
  - bpo#43283: Document why printing to IDLE’s Shell is often
    slower than printing to a system terminal and that it can be
    made faster by pre-formatting a single string before
    printing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 19 16:58:38 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.2:
  - bpo#42938 (bsc#1181126): Avoid static buffers when computing
    the repr of ctypes.c_double and ctypes.c_longdouble
    values. This issue was assigned CVE-2021-3177.
  - bpo#42967 (bsc#1182379): Fix web cache poisoning
    vulnerability by defaulting the query args separator to &,
    and allowing the user to choose a custom separator. This
    issue was assigned CVE-2021-23336.
- Upstreamed patches were removed:
  - CVE-2021-3177-buf_ovrfl_PyCArg_repr.patch
  - bsc1167501-invalid-alignment.patch
  - skip_random_failing_tests.patch
  - CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  9 01:37:59 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add Obsoletes for python3-base when primary interpreter is set to
  properly replace it during upgrades.  (bsc#1181324)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 22:02:03 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.9.1:
  Security bugs:
  - Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion
    when processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary
    format.
  - The plistlib module no longer accepts entity declarations in
    XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should not
    affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular
    plist files.
  - Add volatile to the accumulator variable in
    hmac.compare_digest, making constant-time-defeating
    optimizations less likely.
  Core and Builtins
  - Allow assignment expressions in set literals and set
    comprehensions as per PEP 572. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Fix a regression introduced by the new parser, where an
    unparenthesized walrus operator was not allowed within
    generator expressions.
  - types.GenericAlias objects can now be the targets of
    weakrefs.
  - Fixed a bug in the PEG parser that was causing crashes in
    debug mode. Now errors are checked in left-recursive rules to
    avoid cases where such errors do not get handled in time and
    appear as long-distance crashes in other places.
  - Fixed a possible crash in the PEG parser when checking for
    the ‘!=’ token in the barry_as_flufl rule. Patch by Pablo
    Galindo.
  - Fix handling of errors during creation of PyFunctionObject,
    which resulted in operations on uninitialized memory. Patch
    by Yonatan Goldschmidt.
  - Fix a bug in the parser, where a curly brace following
    a primary didn’t fail immediately. This led to invalid
    expressions like a {b} to throw a SyntaxError with a wrong
    offset, or invalid expressions ending with a curly brace like
    a { to not fail immediately in the REPL.
  - Fix possible buffer overflow in the new parser when checking
    for continuation lines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - Run the parser two times. On the first run, disable all the
    rules that only generate better error messages to gain
    performance. If there’s a parse failure, run the parser
    a second time with those enabled.
  - Document the default implementation of object.__eq__.
  - Fix peephole optimizer misoptimize conditional jump
    + JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH pair.
  - The garbage collector now tracks all user-defined classes.
    Patch by Brandt Bucher.
  - Fixed potential issues with removing not completely
    initialized module from sys.modules when import fails.
  - Star-unpacking is now allowed for with item’s targets in the
    PEG parser.
  - Fixed stack overflow in issubclass() and isinstance() when
    getting the __bases__ attribute leads to infinite recursion.
  - When loading a native module and a load failure occurs,
    prevent a possible UnicodeDecodeError when not running in
    a UTF-8 locale by decoding the load error message using the
    current locale’s encoding.
  - Correctly count control blocks in ‘except’ in compiler.
    Ensures that a syntax error, rather a fatal error, occurs for
    deeply nested, named exception handlers.
  Library
  - types.GenericAlias will now raise a TypeError when attempting
    to initialize with a keyword argument. Previously, this would
    cause the interpreter to crash if the interpreter was
    compiled with debug symbols. This does not affect
    interpreters compiled for release. Patch by Ken Jin.
  - CGIHTTPRequestHandler.run_cgi() HTTP_ACCEPT improperly
    parsed. Replace the special purpose getallmatchingheaders
    with generic get_all method and add relevant tests.
  - inspect.findsource() now raises OSError instead of IndexError
    when co_lineno of a code object is greater than the file
    length. This can happen, for example, when a file is edited
    after it was imported. PR by Irit Katriel.
  - Fix handling of trailing comments by inspect.getsource().
  - ChainMap.__iter__ no longer calls __getitem__ on underlying
    maps
  - TracebackException no longer holds a reference to the
    exception’s traceback object. Consequently, instances of
    TracebackException for equivalent but non-equal exceptions
    now compare as equal.
  - We fixed an issue in pickle.whichmodule in which importing
    multiprocessing could change the how pickle identifies which
    module an object belongs to, potentially breaking the
    unpickling of those objects.
  - Clarify the error message for asyncio.IncompleteReadError
    when expected is None.
  - Extracting a symlink from a tarball should succeed and
    overwrite the symlink if it already exists. The fix is to
    remove the existing file or symlink before extraction. Based
    on patch by Chris AtLee, Jeffrey Kintscher, and Senthil
    Kumaran.
  - Fixed tkinter.ttk.Style.map(). The function accepts now the
    representation of the default state as empty sequence (as
    returned by Style.map()). The structure of the result is now
    the same on all platform and does not depend on the value of
    wantobjects.
  - Fix various issues with typing.Literal parameter handling
    (flatten, deduplicate, use type to cache key). Patch provided
    by Yurii Karabas.
  - Fix the threading.Thread class at fork: do nothing if the
    thread is already stopped (ex: fork called at Python exit).
    Previously, an error was logged in the child process.
  - The onerror callback from shutil.rmtree now receives correct
    function when os.open fails.
  - Fix os.sendfile() on illumos.
  - Fixed writing binary Plist files larger than 4 GiB.
  - The repr() of typing types containing Generic Alias Types
    previously did not show the parameterized types in the
    GenericAlias. They have now been changed to do so.
  - webbrowser: Ignore NotADirectoryError when calling
    xdg-settings.
  - binhex.binhex() consisently writes macOS 9 line endings.
  - Fix a stack overflow error for asyncio Task or Future repr().
  - The overflow occurs under some circumstances when a Task or
    Future recursively returns itself.

    package requires them they typically add them with a python
    version qualifier and the packages have their own version
    numbers.

  - bpo-41162: Audit hooks are now cleared later during
    finalization to avoid missing events.
  - bpo-29778: Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations

    characters in http.client.putrequest(…).
  - bpo-41295: Resolve a regression in CPython 3.8.4 where defining
    “__setattr__” in a multi-inheritance setup and
    calling up the hierarchy chain could fail if builtins/extension
    types were involved in the base types.
  - bpo-41247: Always cache the running loop holder when running
    asyncio.set_running_loop.
  - bpo-41252: Fix incorrect refcounting in
    _ssl.c’s _servername_callback().
  - bpo-41215: Use non-NULL default values in the PEG parser
    keyword list to overcome a bug that was '
    preventing Python from being properly compiled when using the
    XLC compiler. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
  - bpo-41218: Python 3.8.3 had a regression where compiling with
    ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT would
    aggressively mark list comprehension with CO_COROUTINE. Now only
    list comprehension making use of async/await will tagged as so.
  - bpo-41175: Guard against a NULL pointer dereference within
    bytearrayobject triggered by the bytearray() + bytearray() operation.

    loaded more than once. It now uses a global state rather than a module state.
  - bpo-39384: Fixed email.contentmanager to allow set_content() to set a
    null string.
  - bpo-41300: Save files with non-ascii chars.
    Fix regression released in 3.9.0b4 and 3.8.4.
  - bpo-37765: Add keywords to module name completion list.
    Rewrite Completions section of IDLE doc.
  - bpo-40170: Revert PyType_HasFeature() change: it reads

  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)
