  <title>A Perl Module to deal with Dimensions of an Image in Several Popular Formats</title>
  <description>The Image::Size library is based upon the &quot;wwwis&quot; script written by
Alex Knowles *(alex@ed.ac.uk)*, a tool to examine HTML and add 'width'
and 'height' parameters to image tags. The sizes are cached internally
based on the file name, so multiple calls on the same file name (images
used in bulleted lists, for example) do not result in repeated
computations.</description>
