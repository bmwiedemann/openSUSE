  <title>Subroutine metadata &amp; wrapping framework</title>
  <description>Subroutines are an excellent unit of reuse, in some ways they are even
superior to objects (simpler, map better to HTTP/network programming due to
being stateless, etc). Sub::Spec aims to make your subs much more useful,
reusable, powerful.
