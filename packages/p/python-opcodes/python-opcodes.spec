%description
The goal of this project is to document instruction sets in a format convenient
for tools development. An instruction set is represented by three files:

- An XML file that describes instructions
- An XSD file that describes the structure of the XML file
- A Python module that reads the XML file and represents it as a set of Python
  objects

This project is a spin-off from <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy
