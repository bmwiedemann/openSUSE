%description
DEAP is intended to be an easy to use distributed evolutionary algorithm
library in the Python language. Its two main components are modular and
can be used separately. The first module is a Distributed Task Manager
(DTM), which is intended to run on cluster of computers. The second
part is the Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (EAP) framework.
