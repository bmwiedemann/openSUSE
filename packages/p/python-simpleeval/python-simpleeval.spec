%description
A quick single file library for easily adding evaluatable expressions
into python projects. Say you want to allow a user to set an alarm volume,
which could depend on the time of day, alarm level, how many previous alarms
had gone off, and if there is music playing at the time.

Or if you want to allow simple formulare in a web application, but don’t want
to give full eval() access, or don’t want to run in javascript on the client side.
