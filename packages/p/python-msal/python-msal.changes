  * New feature: Support reading ConfidentialClientApplication's
    cert from a pfx file (#684, #699)
  * New feature: TokenCache class has a new search() method which will

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 24 10:25:59 UTC 2023 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.25.0
  + Deprecation: allow_broker will be replaced by enable_broker_on_windows (#613)
  + Bugfix: Device Code Flow (and Username Password Flow) and its subsequent silent
    request will automatically bypass broker and succeed. (#569)
  + Enhancement: acquire_token_interactive() supports running inside Docker
  + Observability: Successful token response will contain a new token_source field
    to indicate where the token was obtained from: identity_provider, cache or broker.
    (#610)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 09:52:17 UTC 2023 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.24.1
  + Includes minor adjustments on handling acquire_token_interactive().
    The scope of the issue being addressed was limited to a short-lived
    sign-in attempt. The potential misuse vector complexity was high,
    therefore it is unlikely to be reproduced in standard usage scenarios;
    however, out of abundance of caution, this fix is shipped to align
    ourselves with Microsoft's policy of secure-by-default.
- from version 1.24.0
  + Enhancement: There may be a new msal_telemetry key available in MSAL's
    acquire token response, currently observed when broker is enabled. Its
    content and format are opaque to caller. This telemetry blob allows
    participating apps to collect them via telemetry, and it may help
    future troubleshooting. (#575)
  + Enhancement: A new enable_pii_log parameter is added into ClientApplication
    constructor. When enabled, the broker component may include PII (Personal
    Identifiable Information) in logs. This may help troubleshooting. (#568, #590)
- Remove temporary version override

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 14 13:29:06 UTC 2023 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.24.0b1
  + Experimental: Surface MSAL telemetry as a long opaque string (#575).
    This behavior is useful if your app has your own telemetry mechanism
    and wants to also collect MSAL's telemetry.
- from version 1.23.0
  + acquire_token_for_client() will automatically look up tokens from cache (#577)
- Override upstream version with 1.24.0~b1

  + Test matrix covers Python 3.11 (#512)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 13 08:02:41 UTC 2022 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.20.0
  + New feature: If your app uses MSAL's acquire_token_interactive(), you can
    now opt in to use broker on Windows platform to achieve Single-Sign-On (SSO)
    and also obtain more secure tokens, all without switching the log-in experience
    to a browser. See details in this online doc, and try it out from this sample.
    (#451, #415)
- from version 1.19.0
  + New feature: A new ClientApplication(..., instance_discovery=False) parameter
    to turn off MSAL's Instance Discovery behavior. See more details in its full
    documentation. Also, ADFS authority will no longer trigger Instance Discovery. (#496)
  + Enhancement: Use provided authority port when building the tenant discovery endpoint (#484)
  + Bugfix: Fix a regression in regional endpoint which affects MSAL Python 1.14+ (#485)
  + Enhancement: Tolerate home_account_id to be None
- from version 1.18.0
  + New feature: Optional initiate_auth_code_flow(..., response_mode="form_post")
    to allow the auth code being delivered to your app by form post, which is
    considered even more secure. (#396, #469)
  + New feature: acquire_token_interactive(..., prompt="none") can obtain some
    tokens from within Cloud Shell, without any prompt. (#420)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 10:35:23 UTC 2022 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.18.0b1
  + New feature: Optional initiate_auth_code_flow(..., response_mode="form_post")
    to allow the auth code being delivered to your app by form post, which is
    considered even more secure. (#396, #469)
  + New feature: acquire_token_interactive(..., prompt="none") can obtain some
    tokens from within Cloud Shell, without any prompt. (#420)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 24 12:27:46 UTC 2022 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.17.0
  + New: Define some Cloud Instance constants and the usage
    pattern of using them (#221, #433)
  + Enhancement: Lazy-load dependencies so that the start-up
    and run time will usually be faster. (#423, #454)
  + Enhancement: Bubble up token refresh exceptions (#431, #434)
  + Enhancement: Documents a simpler http_cache usage pattern (#439)
  + Enhancement: Expose authority discovery error for troubleshooting (#443)
  + Enhancement: Actionable exception message when local machine

    password flow encounters errors with ADFS (#456, #458)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 12:11:05 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.16.0
  + New feature: Introducing a new http_cache parameter, whose documentation
    is available by searching http_cache (dict) from our API Reference Doc
    (Implementation #407). If an app utilizes this feature, it will also
    address #80 & #334.
  + Improvement: Prevent concurrent interactive flows listening on same port
    when running on Windows (#427)
  + Improvement: Detecting Regional Endpoint from env var. Also ensure the
    entire regional endpoint behavior needs to opt in. (#425)
- from version 1.15.0
  + New feature: Now both initiate_auth_code_flow() and acquire_token_interactive()
    accept a new optional parameter max_age which is the allowable elapsed time
    in seconds since the last time the End-User was actively authenticated. If
    the elapsed time is greater than this value, Microsoft identity platform
    will actively re-authenticate the End-User. (#381, #389)
  + Improvement: MSAL will now automatically utilize a backup authentication
    system, to provide better resiliency. (#376, #395, #409)
  + Improvement: Previously, acquire_token_interactive() was not able to be aborted
    by CTRL+C when running on Windows. It is now fixed. (#393, #404)
  + Bugfix: The http cache feature shipped in #379 came with an unexpected side
    effect to slow down the Device Code Flow. Now fixed. (#408, #410)
  + Change: Adopting cryptography 35.0.0 (#414)
- from version 1.14.0
  UPDATE: There was a bug in this version, being fixed in subsequent
          1.15.0. We recommend everyone to upgrade to msal>=1.15.0,<2.
  There is no API-level change in this MSAL release. So, all existing
  apps do not need any code changes. Just upgrade, and your app will
  gain the following behaviors.
  + Behavior Change: By default, MSAL Python will launch Edge browser when
    running on Linux, when Edge is installed on current desktop. (#388)
  + Behavior Change: MSAL Python will use an in-memory http-level cache.
    This would improve the latency in normal cases, and improve responsiveness
    for invalid requests and outage. (#159, #379)
  + Behavior Change: MSAL Python will no longer use env var REGION_NAME as
    the Azure region name. (#394, #382)
  + Bugfix: MSAL Python will no longer throw exception when your app
    excludes the profile scope. (#387, #390)
- from version 1.13.0
  + New feature: MSAL supports a confidential client being authenticated
    by a pre-signed assertion. Usage:

    cca = ConfidentialClientApplication(
        ...,
        client_credential={"client_assertion": "...a JWT with claims aud, exp, iss, jti, nbf, and sub..."},
        ...)

    This can be useful for where the signing takes place externally for
    example using Azure Key Vault (AKV). AKV sample included (#161, #271).

   + Improvement: Skip unnecessary and repetitive region detection. (#372, #373)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 29 12:40:07 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.12.0
  + New feature: MSAL Python supports ConfidentialClientApplication(..., azure_region=...).
    If your app is deployed in Azure, you can use this new feature to pin a region.
    (#295, #358)
  + New feature: Historically MSAL Python attempts to acquire a Refresh Token (RT) by
    default. Since this version, MSAL Python supports ConfidentialClientApplication(...,
    excluse_scopes=["offline_access"]) to opt out of RT (#207, #361)
  + Improvement: acquire_token_interactive(...) can also trigger browser when
    running inside WSL (8d86917)
  + Adjustment: get_accounts(...) would automatically combine equivalent accounts,
    so that your account selector widget could be easier to use (#349)
  + Document: MSAL Python has long been accepting acquire_token_interactive(..., prompt="create"),
    now we officially documented it. (#356, #360)
- from version 1.11.0
  + Enhancement: ConfidentialClientApplication also supports
    acquire_token_by_username_password() now. (#294, #344)
  + Enhancement: PublicClientApplication's acquire_token_interactive() also supports WSL Ubuntu
    18.04 (#332, #333)
  + Enhancement: Enable a retry once behavior on connection error. (But this is only available
    from the default http client. If your app supplies your customized http_client via MSAL
    constructors, it is your http_client's job to decide whether retry.) (#326)
  + Enhancement: MSAL improves the internal telemetry mechanism. (#137, #175, #329, #345)
  + Bugfix: Better compatibility on handling SAML token when using
    acquire_token_by_username_password() with ADFS. (#336)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 25 13:35:20 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.10.0
  + Enhancement: Proactive access token (AT) refreshing. Previously, an AT is
    either valid or expired. If an AT expires and your network happens to have
    a glitch, your app wouldn't be able to auth. Now, MSAL Python attempts to
    refresh some AT (typically long-lived AT) half way towards their expiration,
    and silently ignores the error and retries next time, so that your app would
    be more resilient. All these happen automatically, without any code change
    to your app. (#176, #312, #320)
  + Adjustment: MSAL Python will keep RT in token cache even when its usage
    encounters an "invalid_grant" error, so that the RT would likely still
    be used by other requests. (#314, #315)
- from version 1.9.0
  + Enhancement: Starting from this version, MSAL will be compatible with both
    PyJWT 1.x and PyJWT 2.x (#293, #296)
  + Enhancement: Better support for upcoming Azure CLI's SSH extension (#300, #298)
  + Enhancement: Better deprecation message for get_authorization_request_url()
    and acquire_token_by_authorization_code(). (#301, #303)
  + Enhancement: Better exception message when using incorrect case in client_id.
    (#304, #307)
  + Other improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 11 15:39:40 UTC 2021 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.8.0
  + New feature: A new extra_scopes_to_consent parameter is introduced
    to the acquire_token_interactive(...) API (#212, #286)
  + Adjustment to previous version 1.7.0: Lazy import webbrowser module
    only when necessary (#287, #288)
- from version 1.7.0
  + New feature: A new initiate_auth_code_flow() & acquire_token_by_auth_code_flow()
    API, which automatically provides PKCE protection for you (#276, #255).
    (You are recommended to use these 2 new APIs to replace the previous
    get_authorization_request_url() and acquire_token_by_authorization_code().)
  + New feature: A new acquire_token_interactive() (#138, #260, #282), comes with
    a sample (#283)
  + Bugfix: Now MSAL Python can properly access those Refresh Tokens which were
    keyed slightly differently by different apps. (#279, #280)

    key encrypted by a passphrase. (#232, #270)
  + Enhancement: Provides different exception and messages while
    encountering transient error during tenant discovery (#263, #269)
- from version 1.5.1
  + Bugfix: We now cache tokens by specified environment, not by OIDC Discovery.
    This won't matter most of the time, but it can be needed when your tenant is
    in transitional state while migrating to a different cloud. (#247)
  + Bugfix: We now make sure one app's sign-out operation would be successful even
    when another app is acquiring token from cache at the same time. (#258, #262)
- Update Requires from setup.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 19:53:50 UTC 2020 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.3.0
  + New feature: class ```ClientApplication``` accepts a new optional parameter
    ```http_client```. You can provide your own HTTP client to have different
    behavior. (#169) Please refer to API Reference doc.
  + New feature: method ```get_authorization_request_url()``` accepts a new optional
    parameter ```domain_hint```. (#158, #181)
    Please refer to API Reference doc.
  + New feature: A new method ```acquire_token_by_refresh_token()``` to help migrating
    refresh tokens from elsewhere to MSAL Python. (#193)
    Its usage is demonstrated in this sample.
- from version 1.2.0
  + New ```nonce``` parameter is provided in ```both get_authorization_request_url(..., nonce=...)```
    and ```acquire_token_by_authorization_code(..., nonce=...)``` method, so
    that you can use them to mitigate replay attacks, per OIDC specs. (#128, #173).
- from version 1.1.0
    + New ```acquire_token_silent_with_error(...)``` method to expose conditional
      access error classifications (#143, closes #57).
    + App developers can opt in to provide their app's name and version for Microsoft
      Telemetry, so that we can understand your usage pattern and serve you better.
      (#136 closes #130)
    + Internally,
      * Collect anonymous telemetry data to help us improve MSAL Python (#103)
      * Test cases cover ADFS 2019 on-premise scenarios (#142, closes #132)
      * Switched to our latest lab apis for better test infrastructure (#108, #133, #134, #135)
