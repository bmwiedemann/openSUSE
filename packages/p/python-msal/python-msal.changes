- Update to version 1.3.0
  + New feature: class ```ClientApplication``` accepts a new optional parameter
    ```http_client```. You can provide your own HTTP client to have different
    behavior. (#169) Please refer to API Reference doc.
  + New feature: method ```get_authorization_request_url()``` accepts a new optional
    parameter ```domain_hint```. (#158, #181)
    Please refer to API Reference doc.
  + New feature: A new method ```acquire_token_by_refresh_token()``` to help migrating
    refresh tokens from elsewhere to MSAL Python. (#193)
    Its usage is demonstrated in this sample.
- from version 1.2.0
  + New ```nonce``` parameter is provided in ```both get_authorization_request_url(..., nonce=...)```
    and ```acquire_token_by_authorization_code(..., nonce=...)``` method, so
    that you can use them to mitigate replay attacks, per OIDC specs. (#128, #173).
- from version 1.1.0
    + New ```acquire_token_silent_with_error(...)``` method to expose conditional
      access error classifications (#143, closes #57).
    + App developers can opt in to provide their app's name and version for Microsoft
      Telemetry, so that we can understand your usage pattern and serve you better.
      (#136 closes #130)
    + Internally,
      * Collect anonymous telemetry data to help us improve MSAL Python (#103)
      * Test cases cover ADFS 2019 on-premise scenarios (#142, closes #132)
      * Switched to our latest lab apis for better test infrastructure (#108, #133, #134, #135)
