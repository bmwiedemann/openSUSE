  <title>Assertion methods for those who like JUnit.</title>
  <description>This class provides a set of assertion methods useful for writing tests.
The API is based on JUnit4 and the Test::Unit::Lite manpage and the methods
die on failure.

These assertion methods might be not useful for common the Test::Builder
manpage-based (the Test::Simple manpage, the Test::More manpage, etc.) test
units.

The assertion methods can be used in class which is derived from
'Test::Assert' or used as standard Perl functions after importing them into
user's namespace.

'Test::Assert' can also wrap standard the Test::Simple manpage, the
Test::More manpage or other the Test::Builder manpage-based tests.

The assertions can be also used for run-time checking.
