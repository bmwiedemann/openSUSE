- Add versions to dependencies
- Remove python-sasl from build dependencies
- Update to version 2.4.1
  * To avoid breaking the API basic_consume() now returns the consumer tag
    instead of a tuple when nowait is True.
  * Fix crash in basic_publish when broker does not support connection.blocked
    capability.
  * read_frame() is now Python 3 compatible for large payloads.
  * Support float read_timeout/write_timeout.
  * Always treat SSLError timeouts as socket timeouts.
  * Treat EWOULDBLOCK as timeout.
- from 2.4.0
  * Fix inconsistent frame_handler return value.
    The function returned by frame_handler is meant to return True
    once the complete message is received and the callback is called,
    False otherwise.
    This fixes the return value for messages with a body split across
    multiple frames, and heartbeat frames.
  * Don't default content_encoding to utf-8 for bytes.
    This is not an acceptable default as the content may not be
    valid utf-8, and even if it is, the producer likely does not
    expect the message to be decoded by the consumer.
  * Fix encoding of messages with multibyte characters.
    Body length was previously calculated using string length,
    which may be less than the length of the encoded body when
    it contains multibyte sequences. This caused the body of
    the frame to be truncated.
  * Respect content_encoding when encoding messages.
    Previously the content_encoding was ignored and messages
    were always encoded as utf-8. This caused messages to be
    incorrectly decoded if content_encoding is properly respected
    when decoding.
  * Fix AMQP protocol header for AMQP 0-9-1.
    Previously it was set to a different value for unknown reasons.
  * Add support for Python 3.7.
    Change direct SSLSocket instantiation with wrap_socket.
  * Add support for field type "x" (byte array).
  * If there is an exception raised on Connection.connect or
    Connection.close, ensure that the underlying transport socket
    is closed.  Adjust exception message on connection errors as well.
  * TCP_USER_TIMEOUT has to be excluded from KNOWN_TCP_OPTS in BSD platforms.
  * Handle negative acknowledgments.
  * Added integration tests.
  * Fix basic_consume() with no consumer_tag provided.
  * Improved empty AMQPError string representation.
  * Drain events before publish.
    This is needed to capture out of memory messages for clients that only
    publish. Otherwise on_blocked is never called.
  * Don't revive channel when connection is closing.
    When connection is closing don't raise error when Channel.Close
    method is received.

Sun Jun 24 15:30:55 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 2.3.2:
  * Fix a regression that occurs when running amqp under Python 2.7 on
    OSX.  TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is not available when running on OSX.  We
    now remove it from the set of known TCP options.

- changes from version 2.3.1:
  * Fix a regression that occurs when running amqp under Python 2.7.
    #182 mistakingly replaced a type check with unicode to string_t
    which is str in Python 2.7. text_t should have been used instead.
    This is now fixed and the tests have been adjusted to ensure this
    never regresses again.

- changes from version 2.2.0:
  * Fix random delays in task execution.  This is a bug that caused

    contributed by **Robert Kopaczewski**
