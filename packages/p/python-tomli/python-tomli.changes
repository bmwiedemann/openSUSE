- Upgrade to 2.0.0:
  - Removed Python 3.6 support
  - Support for text file objects as load input. Use binary file
    objects instead.
  - First argument of load and loads can no longer be passed by
    keyword.
  - Allow lower case "t" and "z" in datetimes
  - Raise an error when dotted keys define values outside the
    "current table". Technically speaking TOML v1.0.0 does allow
    such assignments but that isn't intended by specification
    writers, and will change in a future specification version
    (see the pull request).
  - Illegal characters in error messages were surrounded by two
    pairs of quotation marks
  - TOMLDecodeError.__module__ is now the public import path
    (tomli) instead of private import path (tomli._parser)
  - Eliminated an import cycle when typing.TYPE_CHECKING is
    True. This allows sphinx-autodoc-typehints to resolve type
    annotations.

- BuildIgnore ca-certificates: python-pip brings it in for regular
  operation, but as we do not ever do https:// connections during a
  build we do not depend on certificates. Allows us to break up a
  build cycle.
