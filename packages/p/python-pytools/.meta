  <title>A tool box of the missing python fonctionalities</title>
  <description>Pytools is a big bag of things that are &quot;missing&quot; from the Python standard library. This is mainly a dependency of other software packages (pycuda, pyopencl, etc ), and is probably of little interest to you unless you use those. If you're curious nonetheless, here's what's on offer:
* A ton of small tool functions such as len_iterable, argmin, tuple generation,
  permutation generation, ASCII table pretty printing, GvR's mokeypatch_xxx() hack,
  the elusive flatten, and much more.
* Michele Simionato's decorator module
* A time-series logging module, pytools.log.
* Batch job submission, pytools.batchjob.
* A lexer, pytools.lex.
