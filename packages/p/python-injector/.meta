  <title>Python dependency injection framework, inspired by Guice</title>
  <description>Dependency injection as a formal pattern is less useful in Python than
in other languages, primarily due to its support for keyword
arguments, the ease with which objects can be mocked, and its dynamic
nature.

That said, a framework for assisting in this process can remove a lot
of boiler-plate from larger applications. That's where Injector can
help. It automatically and transitively provides keyword arguments
with their values. As an added benefit, Injector encourages nicely
compartmentalised code through the use of Module s.

While being inspired by Guice, it does not slavishly replicate its
API. Providing a Pythonic API trumps faithfulness.
