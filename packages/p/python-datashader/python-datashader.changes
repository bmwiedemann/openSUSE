Mon Nov 21 19:58:10 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.14.3
  * This release fixes a bug related to spatial indexing of
    spatialpandas.GeoDataFrames, and introduces enhancements to
    antialiased lines, benchmarking and GPU support.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Improvements to antialiased lines:
    - Fit antialiased line code within usual numba/dask framework
      (#1142)
    - Refactor stage 2 aggregation for antialiased lines (#1145)
    - Support compound reductions for antialiased lines on the CPU
      (#1146)
  * New benchmark framework:
    - Add benchmarking framework using asv (#1120)
    - Add cudf, dask and dask-cudf Canvas.line benchmarks (#1140)
  * Improvements to GPU support:
    - Cupy implementation of eq_hist (#1129)
  * Improvements to dependency management (#1111, #1116)
  * Improvements to CI (#1132, #1135, #1136, #1137, #1143)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Ensure spatial index _sindex is retained on dataframe copy
    (#1122)
- Version 0.14.2
  * This is a bug fix release to fix an important divide by zero
    bug in antialiased lines, along with improvements to
    documentation and handling of dependencies.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Improvements to handling of dependencies:
    - Correct dask and bokeh dependencies (#1104)
    - Add requests as an install dependency (#1105)
    - Better handle returned dask npartitions in tests (#1107)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix antialiased line divide by zero bug (#1099)
- Version 0.14.1
  * This release provides a number of important bug fixes and small
    enhancements from Ian Thomas along with infrastructure
    improvements from Maxime Liquet and new reductions from
    @tselea.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Improvements to antialiased lines:
    - Support antialiased lines for categorical aggregates (#1081,
      #1083)
    - Correctly handle NaNs in antialiased line coordinates (#1097)
  * Improvements to rescale_discrete_levels for how='eq_hist':
    * Correct implementation of rescale_discrete_levels (#1078)
    * Check before calling rescale_discrete_levels (#1085)
    * Remove empty histogram bins in eq_hist (#1094)
  * Implementation of first and last reduction (#1093) for data
    types other than raster.
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Do not snap trimesh vertices to pixel grid (#1092)
  * Correctly orient (y, x) arrays for xarray (#1095)
  * Infrastructure/build fixes (#1080, #1089, #1096)
- Version 0.14.0
  * This release has been nearly a year in the making, with major
    new contributions from Ian Thomas, Thuy Do Thi Minh, Simon
    Høxbro Hansen, Maxime Liquet, and James Bednar, and additional
    support from Andrii Oriekhov, Philipp Rudiger, and Ajay Thorve.
  ## Enhancements:
  * Full support for antialiased lines of specified width (#1048,
    #1072). Previous antialiasing support was limited to
    single-pixel lines and certain floating-point reduction
    functions. Now supports arbitrary widths and arbitrary
    reduction functions, making antialiasing fully supported.
    Performance ranges from 1.3x to 14x slower than the simplest
    zero-width implementation; see benchmarks.
  * Fixed an issue with visibility on zoomed-in points plots and on
    overlapping line plots that was first reported in 2017, with a
    new option rescale_discrete_levels for how='eq_hist' (#1055)
  * Added a categorical color_key for 2D (unstacked) aggregates
    (#1020), for producing plots where each pixel has at most one
    category value
  ## Bugfixes:
  * Fixed details of the raster coordinate calculations to match
    other primitives, making it simpler to overlay separately
    rendered results (#959, #1046)
  * Various fixes and extensions for cupy/CUDA, e.g. to use cuda
    for category_binning, spread, and dynspread, including
    cupy.interp where appropriate (#1015, #1016, #1044, #1050,
    #1060)
  * Infrastructure/build/ecosystem fixes (#1022, #1025, #1027,
    #1036, #1045, #1049, #1050, #1057, #1061, #1062, #1063, #1064)
  ## Compatibility:
  * Canvas.line() option antialias=True is now deprecated; use
    line_width=1 (or another nonzero value) instead. (#1048)
  * Removed long-deprecated bokeh_ext.py (#1059)
  * Dropped support for Python 2.7 (actually already dropped from
    the tests in Datashader 0.12) and 3.6 (no longer supported by
    many downstream libraries like rioxarray, but several of them
    are not properly declaring that restriction, making 3.6 much
    more difficult to support.) (#1033)
- Drop upstreamed fixes
  * datashader-pr1022-RaggedTests.patch
  * datashader-pr1025-testfixes.patch

- Remove skip_python310, it is not needed anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 21:47:35 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.13.0
  * Defined new dynspread metric based on counting the fraction of
    non-empty pixels that have non-empty pixels within a given
    radius. The resulting dynspread behavior is much more intuitive
    than the old behavior, which counted already-spread pixels as
    if they were neighbors (#1001)
  * Added ds.count() as the default reduction for ds.by (#1004)
  * Fixed array-bounds reading error in dynspread (#1001)
  * Fix color_key argument for dsshow (#986)
  * Added Matplotlib output to the 3_Interactivity getting started
    page. (#1009)
  * Misc docs fixes (#1007)
  * Fix nan assignment to integer array in RaggedArray (#1008)
  * Any usage of dynspread with datatypes other than points should
    be replaced with spread(), which will do what was probably
    intended by the original dynspread call, i.e. to make isolated
    lines and shapes visible. Strictly speaking, dynspread could
    still be useful for other glyph types if that glyph is
    contained entirely in a pixel, e.g. if a polygon or line
    segment is located within the pixel bounds, but that seems
    unlikely.
  * Dynspread may need to have the threshold or max_px arguments
    updated to achieve the same spreading as in previous releases,
    though the new behavior is normally going to be more useful
    than the old.

Wed May 27 07:06:34 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 0.11.0
  New features (see getting_started/2_Pipeline.ipynb for examples):
    New by() categorical aggregator, extending count_cat to work with other reduction functions, no longer just count. Allows binning of aggregates separately per category value, so that you can compare how that aggregate is affected by category value. (#875, #902, #904, #906)
    Support for negative and zero values in tf.shade for categorical aggregates. (#896, #909, #910, #908)
    Support for span in _colorize(). (#875, #910)
    Support for Dask-based quadmesh rendering for rectilinear and curvilinear mesh types (#885, #913)
    Support for Dask-based raster mesh rendering (via Canvas.quadmesh) (#872)
    Faster TMS tileset generation (#886)
    Expanded performance guide (#868)
  Bugfixes:
    Misc bugfixes and improvements (#874, #882, #888, #889, #890, #891)
  Compatibility (breaking changes and deprecations):
    To allow negative-valued aggregates, count_cat now weights categories according to how far they are from the minimum aggregate value observed, while previously they were referenced to zero. Previous behavior can be restored by passing color_baseline=0 to count_cat or by.
    count_cat is now deprecated and removed from the docs; use by(..., count()) instead.
    Result of a count() aggregation is now uint32, not int32, to distinguish counts from other aggregation types (#910).
    tf.shade now only treats zero values as missing for count aggregates (uint); zero is otherwise a valid value distinct from NaN (#910).
    alpha is now respected as the upper end of the alpha range for both _colorize() and _interpolate() in tf.shade; previously only _interpolate respected it.
    Added new nansum_missing utility for working with Numpy>1.9, where nansum no longer returns NaN for all-NaN values.
    ds.geo and ds.spatial modules are now deprecated; their contents have moved to xarray_spatial and spatialpandas, respectively. (#894)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  1 18:28:58 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 0.6.5
  + New features:
    - Trimesh support: Rendering of irregular triangular meshes
      using Canvas.trimesh() (see user guide) (#525,#552)
    - Added a new website at datashader.org, with new Getting
      Started pages and an extensive User Guide, with about 50%
      new material not previously in example notebooks. Built
      entirely from Jupyter notebooks, which can be run in the
      examples/ directory. Website is now complete except for
      sections on points (see the nyc_taxi example in the
      meantime).
    - Canvas.raster() now accepts xarray Dataset types, not just
      DataArrays, with the specific DataArray selectable from the
      Dataset using the column= argument of a supplied
      aggregation function.
    - tf.Images() now displays anything with an HTML
      representation, to allow laying out Pandas dataframes
      alongside datashader output.
  + Bugfixes and compatibility:
    - Changed Raster API to match other glyph types:
      > Now accepts a reduction function via an agg= argument
        like Canvas.line(), Canvas.points(), etc. The previous
        downsample_method is still accepted for this release, but
        is now deprecated.
      > upsample_method is now interpolate, accepting linear=True
        or linear=False; the previous spelling is now deprecated.
      > The layer= argument previously accepted a 1-based integer
        index, which was confusing given the standard Python
        0-based indexing elsewhere. Changed to accept an xarray
        coordinate, which can be a 1-based index if that's what is
        defined on the array, but also works with arbitrary
        floating-point coordinates (e.g. for a depth parameter in
        an image stack).
      > Now auto-ranges in x and y when not given explicit ranges,
        instead of raising an error.
    - Fixed various bugs, including one generating incorrect output
      in Canvas.raster(agg='mode')
