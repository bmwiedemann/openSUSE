- version update to 0.11.0
  New features (see getting_started/2_Pipeline.ipynb for examples):
    New by() categorical aggregator, extending count_cat to work with other reduction functions, no longer just count. Allows binning of aggregates separately per category value, so that you can compare how that aggregate is affected by category value. (#875, #902, #904, #906)
    Support for negative and zero values in tf.shade for categorical aggregates. (#896, #909, #910, #908)
    Support for span in _colorize(). (#875, #910)
    Support for Dask-based quadmesh rendering for rectilinear and curvilinear mesh types (#885, #913)
    Support for Dask-based raster mesh rendering (via Canvas.quadmesh) (#872)
    Faster TMS tileset generation (#886)
    Expanded performance guide (#868)
  Bugfixes:
    Misc bugfixes and improvements (#874, #882, #888, #889, #890, #891)
  Compatibility (breaking changes and deprecations):
    To allow negative-valued aggregates, count_cat now weights categories according to how far they are from the minimum aggregate value observed, while previously they were referenced to zero. Previous behavior can be restored by passing color_baseline=0 to count_cat or by.
    count_cat is now deprecated and removed from the docs; use by(..., count()) instead.
    Result of a count() aggregation is now uint32, not int32, to distinguish counts from other aggregation types (#910).
    tf.shade now only treats zero values as missing for count aggregates (uint); zero is otherwise a valid value distinct from NaN (#910).
    alpha is now respected as the upper end of the alpha range for both _colorize() and _interpolate() in tf.shade; previously only _interpolate respected it.
    Added new nansum_missing utility for working with Numpy>1.9, where nansum no longer returns NaN for all-NaN values.
    ds.geo and ds.spatial modules are now deprecated; their contents have moved to xarray_spatial and spatialpandas, respectively. (#894)

- Update to 0.6.5
  + New features:
    - Trimesh support: Rendering of irregular triangular meshes
      using Canvas.trimesh() (see user guide) (#525,#552)
    - Added a new website at datashader.org, with new Getting
      Started pages and an extensive User Guide, with about 50%
      new material not previously in example notebooks. Built
      entirely from Jupyter notebooks, which can be run in the
      examples/ directory. Website is now complete except for
      sections on points (see the nyc_taxi example in the
      meantime).
    - Canvas.raster() now accepts xarray Dataset types, not just
      DataArrays, with the specific DataArray selectable from the
      Dataset using the column= argument of a supplied
      aggregation function.
    - tf.Images() now displays anything with an HTML
      representation, to allow laying out Pandas dataframes
      alongside datashader output.
  + Bugfixes and compatibility:
    - Changed Raster API to match other glyph types:
      > Now accepts a reduction function via an agg= argument
        like Canvas.line(), Canvas.points(), etc. The previous
        downsample_method is still accepted for this release, but
        is now deprecated.
      > upsample_method is now interpolate, accepting linear=True
        or linear=False; the previous spelling is now deprecated.
      > The layer= argument previously accepted a 1-based integer
        index, which was confusing given the standard Python
        0-based indexing elsewhere. Changed to accept an xarray
        coordinate, which can be a 1-based index if that's what is
        defined on the array, but also works with arbitrary
        floating-point coordinates (e.g. for a depth parameter in
        an image stack).
      > Now auto-ranges in x and y when not given explicit ranges,
        instead of raising an error.
    - Fixed various bugs, including one generating incorrect output
      in Canvas.raster(agg='mode')
