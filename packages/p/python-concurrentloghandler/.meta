  <title>Concurrent logging handler</title>
  <description>This module provides an additional log handler for Python's standard logging
package (PEP 282). This handler will write log events to log file which is
rotated when the log file reaches a certain size. Multiple processes can safely
write to the same log file concurrently.</description>
