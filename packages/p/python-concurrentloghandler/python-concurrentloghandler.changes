Update to 0.9.19:
    0.9.19: Fix Python 2 compatibility (again), thanks @buddly27
            Fix accidental detection of 'darwin' (Mac OS) as
            Windows in setup.py
    0.9.18: Remove ez_setup from the setup.py
    0.9.17: Contains the following fixes:
      - Catch exceptions when unlocking the lock.
      - Clarify documentation, esp. with use of multiprocessing
      - In Python 2, don't request/allow portalocker 2.0 which
        won't work. (Require portalocker<=1.7.1)
    0.9.16: Fix publishing issue with incorrect code included in
            the wheel Affects Python 2 mainly - see Issue #21
    0.9.15: Fix bug from last version on Python 2. (Issue #21)
            Thanks @condontrevor Also, on Python 2 and 3, apply
            unicode_error_policy (default: ignore) to convert
            a log message to the output stream's encoding. I.e.,
            by default it will filter out (remove) any characters
            in a log message which cannot be converted to the
            output logfile's encoding.
    0.9.14: Fix writing LF line endings on Windows when encoding
            is specified. Added newline and terminator kwargs to
            allow customizing line ending behavior. Thanks to
            @vashek
    0.9.13: Fixes Crashes with ValueError: I/O operation on
            closed file (issue #16) Also should fix issue #13
            with crashes related to Windows file locking. Big
            thanks to @terencehonles, @nsmcan, @wkoot, @dismine
            for doing the hard parts
    0.9.12: Add umask option (thanks to @blakehilliard) This adds
            the ability to control the permission flags when
            creating log files.
    0.9.11: Fix issues with gzip compression option (use
            buffering)
    0.9.10: Fix inadvertent lock sharing when forking Thanks to
            @eriktews for this fix
    0.9.9: Fix Python 2 compatibility broken in last release
    0.9.8: Bug fixes and permission features
      - Fix for issue #4 - AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has
        no attribute 'write' This error could be caused if
        a rollover occurred inside a logging statement that was
        generated from within another logging statement's
        format() call.
      - Fix for PyWin32 dependency specification (explicitly
        require PyWin32)
      - Ability to specify owner and permissions (mode) of
        rollover files [Unix only]
    0.9.7/0.9.6: Fix platform specifier for PyPi
    0.9.5: Add use_gzip option to compress rotated logs. Add an
           optional threaded logging queue handler based on the
           standard library's logging.QueueHandler.
    0.9.4: Fix setup.py to not include tests in distribution.
    0.9.3: Refactoring release
      - For publishing fork on pypi as concurrent-log-handler
        under new package name.
      - NOTE: PyWin32 is required on Windows but is not an
        explicit dependency because the PyWin32 package is not
        currently installable through pip.
      - Fix lock behavior / race condition
    0.9.2: Initial release of fork by Preston Landers based on
           a fork of Lowell Alleman's ConcurrentLogHandler 0.9.1
      - Fixes deadlocking issue with recent versions of Python
      - Puts .__ prefix in front of lock file name
      - Use secrets or SystemRandom if available.
      - Add/fix Windows support
- Remove ConcurrentLogHandler-0.9.1-testpath.patch, which is
  unnecessary
