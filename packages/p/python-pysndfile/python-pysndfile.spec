%description
pysndfile is a python package providing PySndfile a
Cython wrapper class around libsndfile . PySndfile
provides methods for reading and writing a large variety of soundfile
formats on a variety of plattforms. PySndfile provides a rather complete
access to the different sound file manipulation options that are
available in libsndfile.

Due to the use of libsndfile nearly all sound file formats, (besides mp3
and derived formats) can be read and written with PySndfile.

The interface has been designed such that a rather large subset of the
functionality of libsndfile can be used, notably the reading and writing
of strings into soundfile formats that support these, and a number of
sf\_commands that allow to control the way libsndfile reads and writes
the samples. One of the most important ones is the use of the clipping
command.
