          + Fix : [RT #127118] : Fails on perl >= v5.28.0 with -DDEBUGGING
                  The module has been amended to accomodate with a change of
                  behaviour of a core macro.
          + Upd : Contact info.

                  Thanks Father Chrysostomos for reporting and contributing a
                  patch.

          + Chg : A large chunk of boilerplate XS code, which is also used in
                  other XS modules, has been factored out of the main .xs file
                  to a collection of .h files in the xsh subdirectory.
          + Fix : [RT #115392] : Intermittent segfaults with heredocs
                  Heredocs should now be handled correctly.
                  Thanks Graham Knop for reporting.

          + Fix : [RT #104312] : fatal hides perl errors in modules
                  no indirect 'fatal' will no longer hide compilation errors
                  occurring before indirect constructs.
                  Thanks Lukas Mai for reporting.

          + Fix : The module could end being disabled in one thread if it was
                  first loaded in another thread and that thread was immediately
                  terminated. This is now fixed and should address test failures
                  of t//09-load-threads.t and t/42-threads-global.t.
  
  0.34    2015-04-02 19:50 UTC
          + Chg : The new environment variable to enable thread tests on older
                  perls is PERL_FORCE_TEST_THREADS. Note that this variable
                  should only be turned on by authors.
          + Fix : [RT #100068] : add link to historical tchrist post
                  The link has been added to the documentation. Thanks Olivier
                  MenguÃ© for reporting.
          + Fix : Segfaults when the module is loaded by several threads (or
                  Windows emulated processes) ran in parallel.
          + Fix : Update the Windows ActivePerl + gcc 3.4 workaround for
                  ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.04. Thanks Christian Walde for reporting
                  and feedback on this issue.
          + Fix : Be really compatible with the optional OP_PARENT feature.
          + Tst : $ENV{$Config{ldlibpthname}} is now preserved on all platforms,
                  which will address failures of t/41-threads-teardown.t and
                  t/50-external.t with unusual compilers (like icc) that link all
                  their compiled objects to their own libraries.
  
  0.33    2014-09-29 20:20 UTC
          + Fix : [RT #99083] : Breaks eval in an END block in Win32 pseudo-forks.
                  Thanks Graham Knop for reporting.
          + Fix : Segfaults during global destruction of a thread or a
                  pseudo-fork.
  
  0.32    2014-09-21 20:15 UTC
          + Add : Support for the PERL_OP_PARENT optional feature introduced in
                  perl 5.21.2.
          + Fix : [RT #92806] : Tests that use run_perl() fail on Android
                  Thanks Brian Fraser for the patch.
          + Fix : indirect constructs will no longer segfault while inside
                  the empty package on perl 5.8.x. This fix may also prevent
                  some segfaults during global destruction.

- updated to 0.31
         + Fix : [RT #88428] : no indirect in eval can trigger for direct calls
                 on __PACKAGE__
                 Thanks Graham Knop for reporting.
         + Tst : Author tests are no longer bundled with this distribution.
                 They are only made available to authors in the git repository.
         + Fix : [RT #83806] : false positives with Devel::Declare
                 [RT #83839] : false positive using ? : syntax
                 Thanks Andrew Main for the patch.
                 However, please note that the reason this patch seems to fix
                 thinks has not been explained.
         + Fix : [RT #84649] : incorrect RT link in metadata
                 Thanks Karen Etheridge for reporting.
         + Fix : [RT #83659] : false positives
                 Proper method calls in string-like environments (like
                 "@{[ $x->new ]}" will no longer be reported as indirect.
                 This was a regression in 0.28.
                 Thanks Andrew Main for reporting.
         + Fix : Broken linkage on Windows with gcc 3.4, which appears in
                 particular when using ActivePerl's default compiler suite.
                 For those setups, the indirect shared library will now be
                 linked against the perl dll directly (instead of the import
                 library).
         + Fix : [RT #83450] : newlines confuse indirect
                 Perl sometimes resets the line buffer between the object and
                 the method name (e.g. for "sort Class\n->method" outside of
                 eval), and this could cause direct method calls to be reported
                 as indirect.
