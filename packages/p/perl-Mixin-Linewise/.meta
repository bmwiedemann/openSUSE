  <title>write your linewise code for handles; this does the rest</title>
  <description>It's boring to deal with opening files for IO, converting strings to
handle-like objects, and all that. With the Mixin::Linewise::Readers
manpage and the Mixin::Linewise::Writers manpage, you can just write a
method to handle handles, and methods for handling strings and filenames
are added for you.</description>
