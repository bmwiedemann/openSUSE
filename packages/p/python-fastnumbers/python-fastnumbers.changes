- Update to 3.1.0:
  * Added
    + query_type function to determine what as type fastnumbers will
      interpret a given input
  * Fixed
    + Support for Python 3.9 (eliminate use of private Python C function
      that is now hidden in 3.9)

Thu Jan 30 14:50:20 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 3.0.0
  + Added
    * Support and tests for Python 3.8
    * Text to highlight that `fastnumbers` is not always faster that native Python
    * `on_fail` option that is identical to `key`, but has a more descriptive name
    * Windows testing to Travis-CI
    * Code quality checks to Travis-CI
    * Deployment from Travis-CI
    * RELEASING.md
  + Changed
    * Cleaned up all test code so that it no longer includes unused code
      and also conformes to flake8/black
    * Near-complete re-write of the README, hopefully to make the functionality
      of `fastnumbers` clearer, to support better navigation, and to better
      highlight caveats.
    * Made all named options keyword-only except for `default`
  + Deprecated
    * `key` function (it will forever remain allowed, but is "hidden" and cannot
      be given with `on_fail`)
  + Fixed
    * Bug where the `coerce` option of `real()` was ignored
    * Improved testing reproducibility by pinning all test dependencies
  + Removed
    * Support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4
    * Appveyor service

Sun Sep 30 16:20:37 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 2.1.1:
  * Fix compile error on FreeBSD where fastnumbers’ “string.h”
    shadowed the system “string.h”.
  * Add a high-level description of the fastnumbers algorithm in the
    documentation.

- changes from version 2.1.0:
  * Fix bug in converting unicode numbers on Python 3.7.
  * Restructure code base, hopefully improving simplicity.
  * Speedup of conversions of ASCII-like unicode in Python 3.
  * Speedup of conversions for large integers and large floats -
    fastnumbers should now be at least as fast as built-in functions.

- changes from version 2.0.5:
  * Fix bug in fast_real that resulted in an OverflowError when given
    very large int-like floats.
  * Source files are sorted before compilation.
