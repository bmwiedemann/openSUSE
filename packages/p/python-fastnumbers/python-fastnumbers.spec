%description
fastnumbers is a Python module with three objectives:

1. To provide drop-in replacements for the Python built-in `int` and
   `float` that, on average, are around 2x faster. These functions
   should behave identically to the Python built-ins except for a few
   specific corner-cases as mentioned in the API documentation.
2. To provide a set of convenience functions that wrap the above int
   and float replacements and provide error handling.
3. To provide a set of functions that can be used to identify whether
   an input could be converted to int or float.
