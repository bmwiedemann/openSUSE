Sun Dec 20 09:38:35 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.0.8:
  - Added `validator` parameter to `input_dialog`.
  - New "placeholder" parameter added to `PromptSession`.
  - Fixes
  - The SSH/Telnet adaptors have been refactored and improved in several ways.
    See issues #876 and PR #1150 and #1184 on GitHub.
    * Handle terminal types for both telnet and SSH sessions.
    * Added pipe input abstraction. (base class for `PosixPipeInput` and
      `Win32PipeInput`).
    * The color depth logic has been refactored and moved to the `Output`
      implementations. Added `get_default_color_depth` method to `Output`
      objects.
    * All line feets are now preceded by a carriage return in the telnet
      connection stdout.
  - Introduce `REPLACE_SINGLE` input mode for Vi key bindings.
  - Improvements to the checkbox implementation:
      * Hide the scrollbar for a single checkbox.
      * Added a "checked" setter to the checkbox.
  - Expose `KeyPressEvent` in key_binding/__init__.py (often used in type
    annotations).
  - The renderer has been optimized so that no trailing spaces are generated
    (this improves copying in some terminals).

Wed Mar 18 15:27:06 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.4
  * Python 2 support has been dropped.
  * Native asyncio, so some async code becomes slightly different.
  * (almost) 100% type annotated.
  * Added shift-based text selection (use shift+arrows to start selecting text).
  * Accept an empty prompt continuation.
  * Improved support for "dumb" terminals.
  * `ShiftControl` has been replaced with `ControlShift` and `s-c` with `c-s` in
    key bindings. Aliases for backwards-compatibility have been added.

Thu Oct 10 08:31:46 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.10:
  * minor bugfixes around

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  2 05:14:33 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 2.0.9:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fixed `Application.run_system_command` on Windows.
    + Fixed bug in ANSI text formatting: correctly handle 256/true
      color sequences.
    + Fixed bug in WordCompleter. Provide completions when there's a
      space before the cursor.

- changes from version 2.0.8:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fixes the issue where changes made to the buffer in the accept
      handler were not reflected in the history.
    + Fix in the application invalidate handler. This prevents a
      significat slow down in some applications after some time
      (especially if there is a refresh interval).
    + Make `print_container` utility work if the input is not a pty.
  * New features:
    + Underline non breaking spaces instead of rendering as '&'.
    + Added mouse support for radio list.
    + Support completion styles for `READLINE_LIKE` display method.
    + Accept formatted text in the display text of completions.
    + Added a `FuzzyCompleter` and `FuzzyWordCompleter`.
    + Improved error handling in Application (avoid displaying a
      meaningless AssertionError in many cases).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  1 22:41:46 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 2.0.7:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fixed assertion in PromptSession: the style_transformation check
      was wrong.
    + Removed 'default' attribute in PromptSession. Only ask for it in
      the `prompt()` method. This fixes the issue that passing
      `default` once, will store it for all consequent calls in the
      `PromptSession`.
    + Ensure that `__pt_formatted_text__` always returns a
      `FormattedText` instance. This fixes an issue with
      `print_formatted_text`.
  * New features:
    + Improved handling of situations where stdin or stdout are not a
      terminal.  (Print warning instead of failing with an assertion.)
    + Added `print_container` utility.
    + Sound bell when attempting to edit read-only buffer.
    + Handle page-down and page-up keys in RadioList.
    + Accept any `collections.abc.Sequence` for HSplit/VSplit children
      (instead of lists only).
    + Improved Vi key bindings: return to navigation mode when Insert
      is pressed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 13 16:03:06 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 2.0.6:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Don't use the predefined ANSI colors for colors that are defined
      as RGB.  (Terminals can assign different color schemes for ansi
      colors, and we don't want use any of those for colors that are
      defined like #aabbcc for instance.)
    + Fix in handling of CPRs when patch_stdout is used.
  * Backwards incompatible changes:
    + Change to the `Buffer` class. Reset the buffer unless the
      `accept_handler` returns `True` (which means: "keep_text"). This
      doesn't affect applications that use `PromptSession`.
  * New features:
    + Added `AdjustBrightnessStyleTransformation`. This is a simple
      style transformation that improves the rendering on terminals
      with light or dark background.
    + Improved performance (string width caching and line height
      calculation).
    + Improved `TextArea`:
       o Exposed `focus_on_click`.
       o Added attributes: `auto_suggest`, `complete_while_typing`,
         `history`, `get_line_prefix`, `input_processors`.
       o Made attributes writable: `lexer`, `completer`,
         `complete_while_typing`, `accept_handler`, `read_only`,
         `wrap_lines`.

- changes from version 2.0.5:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix in `DynamicContainer`. Return correct result for
      `get_children`. This fixes a bug related to focusing.
    + Properly compute length of `start`, `end` and `sym_b` characters
      of progress bar.
    + CPR (cursor position request) fix.
  * Backwards incompatible changes:
    + Stop restoring `PromptSession` attributes when exiting prompt.
  * New features:
    + Added `get_line_prefix` attribute to window. This opens many
      possibilities:
       o Line wrapping (soft and hard) can insert whitespace in front of
         the line, or insert some symbols in front. Like the Vim
         "breakindent" option.
       o Single line prompts also support line continuations now.
       o Line continuations can have a variable width.
    + For VI mode: implemented temporary normal mode (control-O in
      insert mode).
    + Added style transformations API. Useful for swapping between
      light and dark color schemes. Added `swap_light_and_dark_colors`
      parameter to `prompt()` function.
    + Added `format()` method to ANSI formatted text.
    + Set cursor position for Button widgets.
    + Added `pre_run` argument to `PromptSession.prompt()` method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 28 03:43:16 UTC 2018 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 2.0.4
  + Bug fixes:
    * Fix render height for rendering full screen applications in Windows.
    * Fix in `TextArea`. Set `accept_handler` to `None` if not given.
    * Go to the beginning of the next line when enter is pressed in Vi navigation
      mode, and the buffer doesn't have an accept handler.
    * Fix the `default` argument of the `prompt` function when called multiple
      times.
    * Display decomposed multiwidth characters correctly.
    * Accept `history` in `prompt()` function again.
  + Backwards incompatible changes:
    * Renamed `PipeInput` to `PosixPipeInput`. Added `Win32PipeInput` and
      `create_input_pipe`.
    * Pass `buffer` argument to the `accept_handler` of `TextArea`.
  + New features:
    * Added `accept_default` argument to `prompt()`.
    * Make it easier to change the body/title of a Frame/Dialog.
    * Added `DynamicContainer`.
    * Added `merge_completers` for merging multiple completers together.
    * Add vt100 data to key presses in Windows.
    * Handle left/right key bindings in Vi block insert mode.
- Update to  2.0.3
  + Bug fixes:
    * Fix in 'x' and 'X' Vi key bindings. Correctly handle line endings and args.
    * Fixed off by one error in Vi line selection.
    * Fixed bugs in Vi block selection. Correctly handle lines that the selection
      doesn't cross.
    * Python 2 bugfix. Handle str/unicode correctly.
    * Handle option+left/right in iTerm.
- Update to 2.0.2
  + Bug fixes:
    * Python 3.7 support: correctly handle StopIteration in asynchronous generator.
    * Fixed off-by-one bug in Vi visual block mode.
    * Bugfix in TabsProcessor: handle situations when the cursor is at the end of
      the line.
- Update to 2.0.1
  + Changes:
    * No automatic translation from \r into \n during the input processing. These
      are two different keys that can be handled independently. This is a big
      backward-incompatibility, because the `Enter` key is `ControlM`, not
      `ControlJ`. So, now that we stopped translating \r into \n, it could be that
      custom key bindings for `Enter` don't work anymore. Make sure to bind
      `Keys.Enter` instead of `Keys.ControlJ` for handling the `Enter` key.
    * The `CommandLineInterface` and the `Application` classes are merged. First,
      `CommandLineInterface` contained all the I/O objects (like the input, output
      and event loop), while the `Application` contained everything else. There was
      no practical reason to keep this separation. (`CommandLineInterface` was
      mostly a proxy to `Application`.)
    * prompt_toolkit no longer depends on Pygments, but it can still use Pygments
      for its color schemes and lexers. In many places we used Pygments "Tokens",
      this has been replaced by the concept of class names, somewhat similar to
      HTML and CSS.
      > `PygmentsStyle` and `PygmentsLexer` adaptors are available for
         plugging in Pygments styles and lexers.
      > Wherever we had a list of `(Token, text)` tuples, we now have lists of
        `(style_string, text)` tuples. The style string can contain both inline
        styling as well as refer to a class from the style sheet. `PygmentsTokens`
        is an adaptor that converts a list of Pygments tokens into a list of
        `(style_string, text)` tuples.
    * Changes in the `Style` classes.
      > `style.from_dict` does not exist anymore. Instantiate the ``Style`` class
        directory to create a new style. ``Style.from_dict`` can be used to create
        a style from a dictionary, where the dictionary keys are a space separated
        list of class names, and the values, style strings (like before).
      > `print_tokens` was renamed to `print_formatted_text`.
      > In many places in the layout, we accept a parameter named `style`. All the
        styles from the layout hierarchy are combined to decide what style to be
        used.
      > The ANSI color names were confusing and inconsistent with common naming
        conventions. This has been fixed, but aliases for the original names were
        kept.
    * The way focusing works is different. Before it was always a `Buffer` that
      was focused, and because of that, any visible `BufferControl` that contained
      this `Buffer` would be focused. Now, any user control can be focused. All
      of this is handled in the `Application.layout` object.
    * The `buffers` dictionary (`CommandLineInterface.buffers`) does not exist
      anymore. Further, `buffers` was a `BufferMapping` that keeps track of which
      buffer has the focus. This significantly reduces the freedom for creating
      complex applications. We wanted to move toward a layout that can be defined
      as a (hierarchical) collection of user widgets. A user widget does not need
      to have a `Buffer` underneath and any widget should be focusable.
      > `layout.Layout` was introduced to contain the root layout widget and keep
        track of the focus.
    * The key bindings were refactored. It became much more flexible to combine
      sets of key bindings.
      > `Registry` has been renamed to `KeyBindings`.
      > The `add_binding` function has been renamed to simply `add`.
      > Every `load_*` function returns one `KeyBindings` objects, instead of
        populating an existing one, like before.
      > `ConditionalKeyBindings` was added. This can be used to enable/disable
        all the key bindings from a given `Registry`.
      > A function named `merge_key_bindings` was added. This takes a list of
        `KeyBindings` and merges them into one.
      > `key_binding.defaults.load_key_bindings` was added to load all the key
        bindings.
      > `KeyBindingManager` has been removed completely.
      > `input_processor` was renamed to `key_processor`.
      > The `Key` class does not exist anymore. Every key is a string and it's
        considered fine to use string literals in the key bindings. This is more
        readable, but we still have run-time validation. The `Keys` enum still
        exist (for backwards-compatibility, but also to have an overview of which
        keys are supported.)
      > 'enter' and 'tab' are key aliases for 'c-m' and 'c-i'.
    * User controls can define key bindings, which are active when the user control
      is focused.
      > `UIControl` got a `get_key_bindings` (abstract) method.
    * Changes in the layout engine:
      > `LayoutDimension` was renamed to `Dimension`.
      > `VSplit` and `HSplit` now take a `padding` argument.
      > `VSplit` and `HSplit` now take an `align` argument.
        (TOP/CENTER/BOTTOM/JUSTIFY) or (LEFT/CENTER/RIGHT/JUSTIFY).
      > `Float` now takes `allow_cover_cursor` and `attach_to_window` arguments.
      > `Window` got an `WindowAlign` argument. This can be used for the alignment
        of the content. `TokenListControl` (renamed to `FormattedTextControl`) does
        not have an alignment argument anymore.
      > All container objects, like `Window`, got a `style` argument. The style for
        parent containers propagate to child containers, but can be overriden.
        This is in particular useful for setting a background color.
      > `FillControl` does not exist anymore. Use the `style` and `char` arguments
        of the `Window` class instead.
      > `DummyControl` was added.
      > The continuation function of `PromptMargin` now takes `line_number` and
        `is_soft_wrap` as input.
    * Changes to `BufferControl`:
      > The `InputProcessor` class has been refactored. The `apply_transformation`
        method should now takes a `TransformationInput` object as input.
      > The text `(reverse-i-search)` is now displayed through a processor. (See
        the `shortcuts` module for an example of its usage.)
    * `widgets` and `dialogs` modules:
      > A small collection of widgets was added. These are more complex collections
        of user controls that are ready to embed in a layout. A `shortcuts.dialogs`
        module was added as a high level API for displaying input, confirmation and
        message dialogs.
      > Every class that exposes a ``__pt_container__`` method (which is supposed
        to return a ``Container`` instance) is considered a widget. The
        ``to_container`` shortcut will call this method in situations where a
        ``Container`` object is expected. This avoids inheritance from other
        ``Container`` types, but also having to unpack the container object from
        the widget, in case we would have used composition.
      > Warning: The API of the widgets module is not considered stable yet, and
        can change is the future, if needed.
    * Changes to `Buffer`:
      > A `Buffer` no longer takes an `accept_action`.  Both `AcceptAction` and
        `AbortAction` have been removed. Instead it takes an `accept_handler`.
    * Changes regarding auto completion:
      > The left and right arrows now work in the multi-column auto completion
        menu.
      > By default, autocompletion is synchronous. The completer needs to be
        wrapped in `ThreadedCompleter` in order to get asynchronous autocompletion.
      > When the completer runs in a background thread, completions will be
        displayed as soon as they are generated. This means that we don't have to
        wait for all the completions to be generated, before displaying the first
        one. The completion menus are updated as soon as new completions arrive.
    * Changes regarding input validation:
      > Added the `Validator.from_callable` class method for easy creation of
        new validators.
    * Changes regarding the `History` classes:
      > The `History` base class has a different interface. This was needed for
        asynchronous loading of the history. `ThreadedHistory` was added for this.
    * Changes related to `shortcuts.prompt`:
      > There is now a class `PromptSession` which also has a method `prompt`. Both
        the class and the method take about the same arguments. This can be used to
        create a session. Every `prompt` call of the same instance will reuse all
        the arguments given to the class itself.
        The input history is always shared during the entire session.
        Of course, it's still possible to call the global `prompt` function. This
        will create a new `PromptSession` every time when it's called.
      > The `prompt` function now takes a `key_bindings` argument instead of
        `key_bindings_registry`. This should only contain the additional bindings.
        (The default bindings are always included.)
    * Changes to the event loops:
      > The event loop API is now closer to how asyncio works. A prompt_toolkit
        `Application` now has a `Future` object. Calling the `.run_async()` method
        creates and returns that `Future`. An event loop has a `run_until_complete`
        method that takes a future and runs the event loop until the Future is set.
        The idea is to be able to transition easily to asyncio when Python 2
        support can be dropped in the future.
      > `Application` still has a method `run()` that underneath still runs the
        event loop until the `Future` is set and returns that result.
      > The asyncio adaptors (like the asyncio event loop integration) now require
        Python 3.5. (We use the async/await syntax internally.)
      > The `Input` and `Output` classes have some changes. (Not really important.)
      > `Application.run_sub_applications` has been removed. The alternative is to
        call `run_coroutine_in_terminal` which returns a `Future`.
    * Changes to the `filters` module:
      > The `Application` is no longer passed around, so both `CLIFilter` and
        `SimpleFilter` were merged into `Filter`. `to_cli_filter` and
        `to_simple_filter` became `to_filter`.
      > All filters have been turned into functions. For instance, `IsDone`
        became `is_done` and `HasCompletions` became `has_completions`.
        This was done because almost all classes were called without any arguments
        in the `__init__` causing additional braces everywhere. This means that
        `HasCompletions()` has to be replaced by `has_completions` (without
        parenthesis).
        The few filters that took arguments as input, became functions, but still
        have to be called with the given arguments.
        For new filters, it is recommended to use the `@Condition` decorator,
        rather then inheriting from `Filter`.
    * Other renames:
      > `IncrementalSearchDirection` was renamed to `SearchDirection`.
      > The `use_alternate_screen` parameter has been renamed to `full_screen`.
      > `Buffer.initial_document` was renamed to `Buffer.document`.
      > `TokenListControl` has been renamed to `FormattedTextControl`.
      > `Application.set_return_value` has been renamed to `Application.set_result`.
    * Other new features:
      > `DummyAutoSuggest` and `DynamicAutoSuggest` were added.
      > `DummyClipboard` and `DynamicClipboard` were added.
      > `DummyCompleter` and `DynamicCompleter` were added.
      > `DummyHistory` and `DynamicHistory` was added.
      > `to_container` and `to_window` utilities were added.
