  * Bug fixes
  * Bug fixes and updates to make API more complete
  * Update dependency checking

    XDG_CONFIG_DIR/containers/containers.cfg. The podman system connection is
    used to curate connections.
  * docstrings were cleaned up to aid in future sphinx generated documentation.
  * ssh:// service addresses are supported by the use of an external ssh client.
  * tcp:// connections are not secure.

    allowing access to Podman unique functionality such as Pods.
