- update to 3.2.1:
  * Update packaging
  * Update CI to support testing against released and main podman branches
  * Cleanup CI configuration
  * Bug fixes
  * Bug fixes and updates to make API more complete
  * Update dependency checking
  * PodmanClient() now supports service addresses using ssh:// and tcp://
    schemes. The keyword connection has been added, using its value as a key
    into the connections that have been defined in
    XDG_CONFIG_DIR/containers/containers.cfg. The podman system connection is
    used to curate connections.
  * docstrings were cleaned up to aid in future sphinx generated documentation.
  * ssh:// service addresses are supported by the use of an external ssh client.
  * tcp:// connections are not secure.
  * PodmanClient() introduces docker-py functionality, while additionally
    allowing access to Podman unique functionality such as Pods.
  * Note: APIConnection() and it's support classes will be deprecated.
- add python310.patch: support python 3.10
