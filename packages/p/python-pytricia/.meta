  <title>IP Address Lookup</title>
  <description>Pytricia is a new python module to store IP prefixes in a patricia tree. It's based on Dave Plonka's modified patricia tree code, and has three things to recommend it over related modules (including py-radix and SubnetTree):

1. it's faster
2. it works in Python 3, and
3. there are a few nicer library features for manipulating the structure.</description>
