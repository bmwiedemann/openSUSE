  <title>multidict implementation</title>
  <description>HTTP Headers and URL query string require specific data structure: multidict. It behaves mostly like a regular dict but it may have several values for the same key.

multidict has four multidict classes: MultiDict, MultiDictProxy, CIMultiDict and CIMultiDictProxy.

Immutable proxies (MultiDictProxy and CIMultiDictProxy) provide a dynamic view for the proxied multidict, the view reflects underlying collection changes. They implement the collections.abc.Mapping interface.

Regular mutable (MultiDict and CIMultiDict) classes implement collections.abc.MutableMapping and allows to change their own content.
