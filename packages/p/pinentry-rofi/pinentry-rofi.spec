%description
Simple pinentry gui using rofi.

It's similar in functionality as the gist and the previous
script, but on the MicroOS, where I work now, it is essential
to install as few as possible additional software, so Guile is
certainly too much.

To use pinentry-rofi with gpg-agent, you can set it as the
pinentry-program in the ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf. Note that you
need to use the full path to the binary.
