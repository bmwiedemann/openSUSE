    would be found and believed to be unmeasured HTML template files

  * Drop support for Python 3.4 and 3.5.
  * A setting is available: template_extensions lets you set the file
    extensions that will be considered when looking for unused templates
  * Fix an issue on Windows where file names were being compared
    case-sensitively, causing templates to be missed
  * Fix an issue where tag libraries can't be found if imported
    during test collection.
