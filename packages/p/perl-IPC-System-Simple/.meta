  <title>Run commands simply, with detailed diagnostics</title>
  <description>Calling Perl's in-built &quot;system()&quot; function is easy, determining if it was
successful is *hard*. Let's face it, $? isn't the nicest variable in the
world to play with, and even if you *do* check it, producing a
well-formatted error string takes a lot of work.
&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot; takes the hard work out of calling external
commands.
