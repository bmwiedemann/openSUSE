- Update to 0.17.4
  * Make sure include dir is found even if the lib is not present
    in #974.
- Release 0.17.3
  * A small release related to PYTHON_LIBRARY handling changes in
    0.17.2; scikit-build 0.17.3 returns an empty string from
    get_python_library if no Python library is present (like on
    manylinux), where 0.17.2 returned None, and previous versions
    returned a non-existent path. Note that adding REQUIRED to
    find_package(PythonLibs will fail, but it is incorrect (you
    must not link to libPython.so) and was really just injecting a
    non-existent path before.
  ## Bug fixes
  * Keep get_python_library return type string if python lib
    non-existing for now in #959.
  * Avoid 'not found' warning if libs are not found by
    FindPythonExtensions in #960.
  * FindNumPy should not call FindPythonLibs in #958.

  * Remove unused variable warnings by in #930
- Release 0.17.0
  * A lot of bug fixes are present in this release, focusing on
    Windows, PyPy, and cross compiling. We've also improved the
    compatibility with default setuptools behaviors a little, and
    enabled some things that were previously unavailable, like
    overriding the build type via the cmake argument environment
    variables. We've expanded our CI matrix to include Windows and
    macOS PyPy and some Fortran tests on Linux. This release
    requires Python 3.7+.
  ## Bug fixes

Wed Dec 21 22:23:44 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.4
  * This releases backports additions for Windows ARM
    cross-compiling via cibuildwheel from scikit-build-core 0.1.4.
  * Initial experimental support for Windows ARM cross-compile in
    #824 and #818
  * Replace mailing list with GitHub Discussions board in #823
  * Some CI updates in #811 and #812
- Version 0.16.3

    affecting our tests. Pytest 7.2+ is now supported. setup.py
    <command> and setup_requires are deprecated, and tests are
    marked as such.
  * Fix typo in usage.rst in #795, thanks to @chohner.
  * Support pytest 7.2+ in #801.
  * Change warning filtering in #802.
  * Handle logging changes in setuptools 65.6+ in #807.
  * Add deprecated markers to some tests in #807.
  * Allow known warnings to show up in the tests #807.

  * This addresses one more small regression with the FindPython
    change from 0.16.0 that was affecting conda. #793

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 15:32:48 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.1
  * Patch release that fixes a missing Python requires setting and
    some missing files #790, and addresses a warning from
    setuptools in the tests.
- Drop skbuild-pr785-ignoredeprecation.patch fixed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 12:54:06 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.0
  * This release adds support for Python 3.11 and removes support
    for Python 2.7 and 3.5 (#688). Testing and static checking
    improved, including being fully statically typed internally
    (though setuptools is not fully typed, so it is of limited
    use).
  * All deprecated setuptools/distutils features are also
    deprecated in scikit-build, like the test command,
    easy_install, etc. Editable mode is still unsupported. Python
    3.6 support is deprecated. Older versions of CMake (<3.15) are
    not recommended; a future version will remove support for older
    CMake's (along with providing a better mechanism for ensuring a
    proper CMake is available). If you need any of these features,
    please open or find an issue explaining what and why you need
    something.
  * Cython module now supports FindPython mode. #743
  * PyPy is discovered without extra settings in FindPython mode
    #744
  * FindPython mode uses a new path specification, should help make
    it usable. #774
  * Better flushing and output streams for more consistent output
    ordering. #781
- Add skbuild-pr785-ignoredeprecation.patch
  * gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#785

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 09:44:45 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.15.0
  * Add support for FindPython (including 2 and 3). Thanks

  * Add support for Cygwin. Thanks @ax3l and @DWesl and @poikilos
    for the help! See #485.
  * Fixed issue with distutils usage in Python 3.10. Thanks to
    @SuperSandro2000 for the contribution in #700.
- Release 0.14.1
  * Fix issue with SKBUILD_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS not being read.
  * Reverted manifest install changes.
- Release 0.14.0
  * Add support for --install-target scikit-build command line
    option. And cmake_install_target in setup.py. Allows providing
    an install target different than the default install. Thanks
    @phcerdan for the contribution. See #477.
  * The manifest install location computation was fixed. Thanks
    @kratsg for the contribution in #682.
  * Byte-compilation was skipped due to a missing return. Thanks
    @pekkarr in #678.
  * Packages can now be computed from the same shared collections,
    before this could confuse Scikit-build. Thanks @vyasr in #675.
  * Fixed library detection for PyPy 3.9. Thanks @rkaminsk in #673.
  * Scikit-build now uses pyproject.toml and setuptools_scm to
    build. If you are packaging scikit-build itself, you might need
    to update your requirements. See #634.
  * The codebase is now formatted with Black. #665

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 09:44:44 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Skip a test failing with setuptools 62+

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 20:50:59 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Replace a stray mock import by unittest.mock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 25 13:17:01 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.13.1
  * Do not throw an error when printing info and a logger is
    disconnected. #652

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  5 17:40:26 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.13.0
  * If you are using scikit-build via pyproject.toml, please
    remember to include setuptools and wheel. A future version of
    scikit-build may remove the setuptools install-time hard
    requirement.
  * CMake module /cmake-modules/Cython now uses Cython default
    arguments. This no longer adds --no-docstrings in Release and
    MinSizeRel builds, so Cython docstrings are now retained by
    default. Additionally, --embed-positions is no longer added to
    Debug and RelWithDebInfo builds. Users can enable these and
    other Cython arguments via the option CYTHON_FLAGS. See #518
    and #519, thanks to @bdice for the improvement.
  * Experimental support for ARM64 on Windows. Thanks to
    @gaborkertesz-linaro in #612.
  * Support for MSVC 2022. Thanks to @tttapa for the contribution
    in #627.
  * Support the modern form of target_link_libraries, via
    SKBUILD_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD (somewhat experimental). Thanks
    to @maxbachmann in #611.
  * Update the Ninja path if using the ninja package. This fixes
    repeated isolated builds. Further path inspection and updates
    for isolated builds may be considered in the future. #631,
    thanks to @RUrlus and @segevfiner for help in tracking this
    down.
  * Allow OpenBSD to pass the platform check (untested). See #586.
  * Avoid forcing the min macOS version. Behaviour is now inline
    with setuptools. Users should set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET when
    building (automatic with cibuildwheel), otherwise you will get
    the same value Python was compiled with. Note: This may seem
    like a regression for PyPy until the next release (7.3.8),
    since it was compiled with 10.7, which is too old to build with
    on modern macOS - manually set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
    (including setting it if unset in your setup.py) for PyPy until
    7.3.8. #607
  * Fix logging issue when using Setuptools 60.2+. #623
  * MacOS cross compiling support fix (for conda-forge) for
    built-in modules. Thanks to @isuruf for the contribution in
    #622.
  * Better detection of the library path, fixes some issues with
    PyPy. Thanks to @rkaminsk for the contribution in #620 and
    #630. PyPy is now part of our testing matrix as of #624. Also
    @robtaylor in #632.
  * Fixed issue when cross-compiling on conda-forge (probably
    upstream bug, but easy to avoid). #646.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 10 10:24:26 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.12.0
  * Fixed a regression that caused setuptools to complain about
    unknown setup option (cmake_process_manifest_hook).
  * If it applies, ensure generator toolset is used to configure
    the project.
  * Read CYTHON_FLAGS where needed, instead of once, allowing the
    user to define multiple modules with different flags.
  * Avoid an IndexError if prefix was empty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  3 00:02:25 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Support multiple python3 flavors
  gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#66

  * Support using scikit-build with conan where distro<1.2.0 is required.
    Thanks @AntoinePrv and @Chrismarsh for reporting issue gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#472
    and gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#488.  
  * Fix link in `Conda: Step-by-step` release guide available in `/make_a_release` section.
- Changelog for version 0.11.0    
  * Add a hook to process the cmake install manifest building the wheel. The hook
    function can be specified as an argument to the `setup()` function. This can be used e.g.
    to prevent installing cmake configuration files, headers, or static libraries with the wheel.
    Thanks @SylvainCorlay for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#473.
  * Add support for passing :ref:`CMake configure options <usage_cmake_configure_options>` like `-DFOO:STRING:bar`
    as global `setuptools` or `pip` options.
  * Add support for building project using PyPy or PyPy3. See https://pypy.org
    See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#407.
  * Add support for OS/400 (now known as IBM i).
    Thanks @jwoehr for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#444.
  * Display CMake command used to configure the project.
    Thanks @native-api for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#443.
  * Improve CMake module `/cmake-modules/F2PY` adding `add_f2py_target()` CMake function
    allowing to generate `*-f2pywrappers.f` and `*module.c` files from `*.pyf` files.
    Thanks @xoviat for the contribution.
  * Update CMake module `/cmake-modules/PythonExtensions` adding `add_python_library()`
    and `add_python_extension()`.
    Thanks @xoviat for the contribution.
  * Fix python 2.7 installation ensuring setuptools < 45 is required. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#478.
  * Fix unclosed file resource in :meth:`skbuild.cmaker.CMaker.check_for_bad_installs`.
    Thanks @Nic30 for the suggestion. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#429.
  * Update CMake module `/cmake-modules/PythonExtensions`:
  * Ensure correct suffix is used for compiled python module on windows. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#383.
  * Fix warning using `EXT_SUFFIX` config variable instead of deprecated `SO` variable. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#381.
  * Honor the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable if it is defined on
    macOS. Thanks @certik for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#441.
  * Fix CMake module `/cmake-modules/F2PY` to ensure the `f2py` executable specific to
    the python version being used is found. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#449. Thanks @bnavigator for
    the contribution.
  * Replace `platform.linux_distribution()` which was removed in Python 3.8 by a call to
    `distro.id()`. This adds the `distro` package as dependency. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#458. Thanks
    @bnavigator for the contribution.
  * Add `/notes` section to the `For maintainers` top-level category that includes a comparison between
    `sysconfig` and `distutils.sysconfig` modules.
  * Remove obsolete comment in `cmaker.py`. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#439. Thanks @isuruf
  * Update `initialize_git_repo_and_commit` to prevent signing message on system with commit signing
    enabled globally.
- Remove obsolete patches
