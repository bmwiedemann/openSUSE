Sat Jan 21 17:22:01 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.6
  * Fix a discovery regression in 0.16.5 when a cmake folder or
    cmake.py was present in #848.

  * Fixed a rare encoded error output string on Windows in #842.
  * Better granularity in extras in #838.
  * Add test markers for nosetuptoolsscm and isolated (helpful for

    in #837.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  4 16:30:24 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Remove pyproject.toml tool.pylint entries not relevant for us and
  failing old py3.6 pip in 15.X
- Old setuptools_scm in 15.X does not pull in toml automatically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 22:23:44 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.4
  * This releases backports additions for Windows ARM
    cross-compiling via cibuildwheel from scikit-build-core 0.1.4.
  * Initial experimental support for Windows ARM cross-compile in
    #824 and #818
  * Replace mailing list with GitHub Discussions board in #823
  * Some CI updates in #811 and #812
- Version 0.16.3
  * This release fixes logging issues using setuptools 65.6+
    affecting our tests. Pytest 7.2+ is now supported. setup.py
    <command> and setup_requires are deprecated, and tests are
    marked as such.
  * Fix typo in usage.rst in #795, thanks to @chohner.
  * Support pytest 7.2+ in #801.
  * Change warning filtering in #802.
  * Handle logging changes in setuptools 65.6+ in #807.
  * Add deprecated markers to some tests in #807.
  * Allow known warnings to show up in the tests #807.
- Version 0.16.2
  * This addresses one more small regression with the FindPython
    change from 0.16.0 that was affecting conda. #793

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 15:32:48 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.1
  * Patch release that fixes a missing Python requires setting and
    some missing files #790, and addresses a warning from
    setuptools in the tests.
- Drop skbuild-pr785-ignoredeprecation.patch fixed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 29 12:54:06 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.16.0
  * This release adds support for Python 3.11 and removes support
    for Python 2.7 and 3.5 (#688). Testing and static checking
    improved, including being fully statically typed internally
    (though setuptools is not fully typed, so it is of limited
    use).
  * All deprecated setuptools/distutils features are also
    deprecated in scikit-build, like the test command,
    easy_install, etc. Editable mode is still unsupported. Python
    3.6 support is deprecated. Older versions of CMake (<3.15) are
    not recommended; a future version will remove support for older
    CMake's (along with providing a better mechanism for ensuring a
    proper CMake is available). If you need any of these features,
    please open or find an issue explaining what and why you need
    something.
  * Cython module now supports FindPython mode. #743
  * PyPy is discovered without extra settings in FindPython mode
    #744
  * FindPython mode uses a new path specification, should help make
    it usable. #774
  * Better flushing and output streams for more consistent output
    ordering. #781
- Add skbuild-pr785-ignoredeprecation.patch
  * gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#785

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 09:44:45 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.15.0
  * Add support for FindPython (including 2 and 3). Thanks
    @hameerabbasi for the contribution. See #712.
  * Add support for Cygwin. Thanks @ax3l and @DWesl and @poikilos
    for the help! See #485.
  * Fixed issue with distutils usage in Python 3.10. Thanks to
    @SuperSandro2000 for the contribution in #700.
- Release 0.14.1
  * Fix issue with SKBUILD_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS not being read.
  * Reverted manifest install changes.
- Release 0.14.0
  * Add support for --install-target scikit-build command line
    option. And cmake_install_target in setup.py. Allows providing
    an install target different than the default install. Thanks
    @phcerdan for the contribution. See #477.
  * The manifest install location computation was fixed. Thanks
    @kratsg for the contribution in #682.
  * Byte-compilation was skipped due to a missing return. Thanks
    @pekkarr in #678.
  * Packages can now be computed from the same shared collections,
    before this could confuse Scikit-build. Thanks @vyasr in #675.
  * Fixed library detection for PyPy 3.9. Thanks @rkaminsk in #673.
  * Scikit-build now uses pyproject.toml and setuptools_scm to
    build. If you are packaging scikit-build itself, you might need
    to update your requirements. See #634.
  * The codebase is now formatted with Black. #665

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 24 09:44:44 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Skip a test failing with setuptools 62+

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 20:50:59 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Replace a stray mock import by unittest.mock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 25 13:17:01 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.13.1
  * Do not throw an error when printing info and a logger is
    disconnected. #652

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  5 17:40:26 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.13.0
  * If you are using scikit-build via pyproject.toml, please
    remember to include setuptools and wheel. A future version of
    scikit-build may remove the setuptools install-time hard
    requirement.
  * CMake module /cmake-modules/Cython now uses Cython default
    arguments. This no longer adds --no-docstrings in Release and
    MinSizeRel builds, so Cython docstrings are now retained by
    default. Additionally, --embed-positions is no longer added to
    Debug and RelWithDebInfo builds. Users can enable these and
    other Cython arguments via the option CYTHON_FLAGS. See #518
    and #519, thanks to @bdice for the improvement.
  * Experimental support for ARM64 on Windows. Thanks to
    @gaborkertesz-linaro in #612.
  * Support for MSVC 2022. Thanks to @tttapa for the contribution
    in #627.
  * Support the modern form of target_link_libraries, via
    SKBUILD_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD (somewhat experimental). Thanks
    to @maxbachmann in #611.
  * Update the Ninja path if using the ninja package. This fixes
    repeated isolated builds. Further path inspection and updates
    for isolated builds may be considered in the future. #631,
    thanks to @RUrlus and @segevfiner for help in tracking this
    down.
  * Allow OpenBSD to pass the platform check (untested). See #586.
  * Avoid forcing the min macOS version. Behaviour is now inline
    with setuptools. Users should set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET when
    building (automatic with cibuildwheel), otherwise you will get
    the same value Python was compiled with. Note: This may seem
    like a regression for PyPy until the next release (7.3.8),
    since it was compiled with 10.7, which is too old to build with
    on modern macOS - manually set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
    (including setting it if unset in your setup.py) for PyPy until
    7.3.8. #607
  * Fix logging issue when using Setuptools 60.2+. #623
  * MacOS cross compiling support fix (for conda-forge) for
    built-in modules. Thanks to @isuruf for the contribution in
    #622.
  * Better detection of the library path, fixes some issues with
    PyPy. Thanks to @rkaminsk for the contribution in #620 and
    #630. PyPy is now part of our testing matrix as of #624. Also
    @robtaylor in #632.
  * Fixed issue when cross-compiling on conda-forge (probably
    upstream bug, but easy to avoid). #646.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 10 10:24:26 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.12.0
  * Fixed a regression that caused setuptools to complain about
    unknown setup option (cmake_process_manifest_hook).
  * If it applies, ensure generator toolset is used to configure
    the project.
  * Read CYTHON_FLAGS where needed, instead of once, allowing the
    user to define multiple modules with different flags.
  * Avoid an IndexError if prefix was empty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  3 00:02:25 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Support multiple python3 flavors
  gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#66

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  1 17:33:56 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 0.11.1 
  * Support using scikit-build with conan where distro<1.2.0 is required.
    Thanks @AntoinePrv and @Chrismarsh for reporting issue gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#472
    and gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#488.  
  * Fix link in `Conda: Step-by-step` release guide available in `/make_a_release` section.
- Changelog for version 0.11.0    
  * Add a hook to process the cmake install manifest building the wheel. The hook
    function can be specified as an argument to the `setup()` function. This can be used e.g.
    to prevent installing cmake configuration files, headers, or static libraries with the wheel.
    Thanks @SylvainCorlay for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#473.
  * Add support for passing :ref:`CMake configure options <usage_cmake_configure_options>` like `-DFOO:STRING:bar`
    as global `setuptools` or `pip` options.
  * Add support for building project using PyPy or PyPy3. See https://pypy.org
    See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#407.
  * Add support for OS/400 (now known as IBM i).
    Thanks @jwoehr for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#444.
  * Display CMake command used to configure the project.
    Thanks @native-api for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#443.
  * Improve CMake module `/cmake-modules/F2PY` adding `add_f2py_target()` CMake function
    allowing to generate `*-f2pywrappers.f` and `*module.c` files from `*.pyf` files.
    Thanks @xoviat for the contribution.
  * Update CMake module `/cmake-modules/PythonExtensions` adding `add_python_library()`
    and `add_python_extension()`.
    Thanks @xoviat for the contribution.
  * Fix python 2.7 installation ensuring setuptools < 45 is required. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#478.
  * Fix unclosed file resource in :meth:`skbuild.cmaker.CMaker.check_for_bad_installs`.
    Thanks @Nic30 for the suggestion. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#429.
  * Update CMake module `/cmake-modules/PythonExtensions`:
  * Ensure correct suffix is used for compiled python module on windows. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#383.
  * Fix warning using `EXT_SUFFIX` config variable instead of deprecated `SO` variable. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#381.
  * Honor the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable if it is defined on
    macOS. Thanks @certik for the contribution. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#441.
  * Fix CMake module `/cmake-modules/F2PY` to ensure the `f2py` executable specific to
    the python version being used is found. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#449. Thanks @bnavigator for
    the contribution.
  * Replace `platform.linux_distribution()` which was removed in Python 3.8 by a call to
    `distro.id()`. This adds the `distro` package as dependency. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#458. Thanks
    @bnavigator for the contribution.
  * Add `/notes` section to the `For maintainers` top-level category that includes a comparison between
    `sysconfig` and `distutils.sysconfig` modules.
  * Remove obsolete comment in `cmaker.py`. See gh#scikit-build/scikit-build#439. Thanks @isuruf
  * Update `initialize_git_repo_and_commit` to prevent signing message on system with commit signing
    enabled globally.
