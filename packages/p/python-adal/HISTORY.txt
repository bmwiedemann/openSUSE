ADAL Python 1.0.0

    This release includes a breaking change which we have planned for more than 1 year.
    The default value of api_version parameter in the AuthenticationContext constructor has been changed from "1.0" to None. You can still explicitly set it to "1.0" to maintain the old behavior, if needed. (See details in #137)
    This release is otherwise exactly the same as 0.7.0. If you do not want this new behavior, you can pin your environment with 0.7.0. Going forward, new development will happen in 1.x series.
    We discovered and fixed an incorrect cache behavior in 0.6.0, 0.7.0, 1.0.0, 1.0.1. Please upgrade to 1.0.2 or later.

NOT be affected by this change. (#89, #91)
