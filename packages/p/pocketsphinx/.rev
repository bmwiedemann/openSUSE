    <comment>- Update to 5.0.3:
  * This release mainly fixes building for Python 3.12, but also
    fixes a serious bug in the NGramModel wrapper class along the
    way. Note that Python 3.6 and 3.7 are no longer supported.
  * Switch to scikit-build-core and tox to fix many issues.
- Update to 5.0.2:
    Removed unnecessary shinxbase in package config
    Do not attempt to align phones to impossibly short durations (fixes #339)
    Require specific setuptools version to fix editable install (fixes: #353)
- Update to 5.0.1:
    Include examples of live recognition on various platforms
    Add missing close brace for C++
    Use a separate search for ps_set_align_text()
    Fix regression tests and -phone_align in main program
    Use trailing slash with include directory
    Removed unnecessary libpthread in package config
    fix: fix a stray #if WORDS_BIGENDIAN (fixes: #343)
- Update to 5.0.0. Includes among other these notable changes:
  * pocketsphinx_continuous is gone, replaced by plain old
    pocketsphinx, which is documented in the README file.
  * The configuration interface is now quite different. It is not a
    &quot;command-line parser&quot; anymore and the configuration parameters
    have lost their leading dashes.
  * All of the SphinxBase &quot;utility&quot; headers have also been made
    internal and their symbols will no longer be exported on
    Windows. Conversely, the JSGF and N-Gram language model API has
    been included in &lt;pocketsphinx/model.h&gt;.
  * The sphinx_fe and sphinx_cepview utilities have been moved to
    SphinxTrain.
  * The audio interface (&lt;sphinxbase/ad.h&gt;) has been removed.
  * The -remove_noise option is now controlled by the acoustic
    model as it needs to match the training.
  * The -remove_silence option has been removed as it is a Bad Idea
    and Considered Harmful for batch mode recognition. Please use
    the endpointer API as detailed in &lt;pocketsphinx/endpointer.h&gt;
    and examples/live.c or examples/live.py.
  * The -cmninit option is not controlled by the default acoustic
    model anymore. This may cause some problems for live
    recognition as the defaults may not match the feature
    extraction parameters.
  * The SWIG wrappers have been removed. Only Python 3 is directly
    supported as a dynamic language binding. Node.js may be
    supported in the near future. The C API is specifically
    designed to be easily supported through FFI, so you can do
    that.
  * Python support is much improved, fully documented, and builds a
    proper module directly from the (top level of the) source tree
    with pip or build.
  * Android support is gone but may come back (contributions
    welcome, I don't have time to support anything other than Linux
    on x86_64 and s390x)
  * Other changes:
  * Change the &lt;pocketsphinx/search.h&gt; API to be slightly more
    intuitive
  * New force-alignment API and two-pass alignment to get
    phone/state durations
  * Uniformize API and test fixed-point mode properly
  * Fix float-to-int underflows (#199, #252)
  * Disallow multiple search types in config or command-line
  * Revert incorrect optimizations to JSGF compiler (fixes #53)
  * Make seg_iter and hyp behave as expected in kws search
    (fixes #122)
  * feat: add -config and config to parse and save JSON
  * Resurrect GStreamer support
  * Remove sphinxbase and modernize configuration API
  * Add support for input files to pocketsphinx command line
  * Add compatibility with pocketsphinx-python 0.1.5
  * Rename pocketsphinx5 to pocketsphinx
  * Updated the en-us dict
  * Fix memory leak in allphone_search.c
  * Forward declare allphone_clear_segments in allphone_search.c
  * Make force alignment accessible from pocketsphinx_batch and
    the ps_decoder API
  * Improve linking for internal headers
  * Fix memory leak in bin_mdef_read_text
  * Large build system and small API modernizations
  * Fix windows build
  * Fix endianness issues in binary trie LM code
  * Build a proper Python package
  * Update -cmninit parameter when CMN is updated
  * Switch back to Cython and use scikit-build for Python module
  * Document Python module better and build ReadTheDocs with
    (the other) Sphinx
  * Fix install command for Mac and iOS builds
  * Incoporate WebRTC VAD code
  * Reorganize header files
  * Remove thread library
  * Add a proper API for cepstral mean normalization
  * Make -samprate an int after all these years
- Obsoletes the pocketsphinx5/sphinxbase/sphinxbase5 packages and
  remove the use of update-alternatives since it's not needed
  anymore.
- Add _service file.
- Add _multibuild to build the python package.
- Drop patches that don't seem to be needed anymore:
  * pocketsphinx-doxygen.patch
  * pocketsphinx-largefile.patch
  * pocketsphinx-long-utterance.patch
  * use-python3.patch
- Add patch to fix installation directory of python module:
  * fix-python-installation.patch
