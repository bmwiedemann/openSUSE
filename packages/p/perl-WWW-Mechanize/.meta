  <title>Handy web browsing in a Perl object</title>
  <description>WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate interaction with a
website. It supports performing a sequence of page fetches including following
links and submitting forms. Each fetched page is parsed and its links and
forms are extracted. A link or a form can be selected, form fields can be
filled and the next page can be fetched. Mech also stores a history of the
URLs you've visited, which can be queried and revisited.</description>
