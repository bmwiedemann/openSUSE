  <title>Traces memory leaks</title>
  <description>'Test::LeakTrace' provides several functions that trace memory leaks. This
module scans arenas, the memory allocation system, so it can detect any
leaked SVs in given blocks.

*Leaked SVs* are SVs which are not released after the end of the scope they
have been created. These SVs include global variables and internal caches.
For example, if you call a method in a tracing block, perl might prepare a
cache for the method. Thus, to trace true leaks, 'no_leaks_ok()' and
'leaks_cmp_ok()' executes a block more than once.</description>
