  <title>Tree to tree correction between xml documents</title>
  <description>XMLdiff shows the differences between two similar XML files in the same
way 'diff' does with text files. It can also be used as a library or as
a command line tool and can work either with XML files or DOM trees.
The implementation is based on &quot;Change detection in hierarchically
structured information&quot;, by S. Chawathe, A. Rajaraman, H.
Garcia-Molina, and J. Widom, Stanford University, 1996.</description>
