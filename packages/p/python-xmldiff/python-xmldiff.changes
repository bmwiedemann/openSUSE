Tue Nov  5 14:15:34 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 2.7.0
  * Changed the comparison to make accurate and standard more accurate,
    although fast gets less accurate as a result.
  * Changed usage of deprecated `pkg_resources` package to `importlib.metadata`.
  * A `use_replace` flag was added to the `XMLFormatter` by Thomas Pfitzinger.
    It changes text replacement from delete and insert tags to a replace tag.
    It's not currently accessaible thtough the CLI, the question is it is better
    to add a new formatter name, or an option to pass in formatter flags.
    + Added option to XMLFormatter to use replace tags
    + in _make_diff_tags after diffing, neighboring delete/insert diffs are
      joined to a replace tag
    + the deleted text is added as an attribute ("old-text")
    + the inserted text is the element's text
- Drop README.txt from %files section, removed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 04:33:13 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.6.3:
  * Solved an error in the xmlformatter when using default namespaces. #89
  * #108: Fixed an error that happens if using namespaces like ns0 or ns1.
  * Added `InsertNamespace` and `DeleteNamespace` actions for better handling
    of changing namespaces. Should improve any "Unknown namespace prefix"
    errors. Changing the URI of a a namespace prefix is not supported, and
    will raise an error.
  * Used geometric mean for the node_ratio, for better handling of simple nodes.
  * Added an experimental --best-match method that is slower, but generate
    smaller diffs when you have many nodes that are similar.
  * The -F argument now also affects the --fast-match stage.
  * Make it possible to adjust the attributes considered when comparing nodes.
  * Python versions 3.7 to 3.11 are now supported.
  * Improved node matching method, that puts more emphasis similarities than
    differences when weighing attributes vs children.
  * Added a parameter to return error code 1 when there are differences
    between the files
  * Added a parameter for ignoring attributes in comparison.
  * Solved a bug in xmlpatch in certain namespace situations.
  * Added a --diff-encoding parameter to xmlpatch, to support diff-files
    that are not in your system default encoding.
- Switch to autosetup and pyproject macros.
- No more greedy globs in %files.
- Drop python-xmldiff-src-upgrades.patch, now included upstream.
- Drop python-xmldiff-no-six-remains.patch, no longer required.

Wed Oct 30 12:37:21 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

    attributes for tree matching.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  9 08:12:37 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- package reworked from scratch
- version update to 2.3
  - A complete, bottom-up, pure-python rewrit
  - A new default output format with new actions
  - A format intended to be parseable by anyone parsing the old format.
  - XML with changes marked though tags and attributes
  - Added options for faster node comparisons. The "middle" option is now
    default, it had very few changes in matches, but is much faster.
  - Implemented a Fast Match algorithm for even faster diffing.
  - Speed improvements through caching
  - Fixed a bug where MoveNode actions sometimes was in the wrong order
  - Added an InsertComment action, as comments require different handling,
    so it's easier to deal with them this way. You can still use DeleteNode and
    UpdateTextIn for them with no special handling.
  - When renaming tags the XMLFormatter will mark them with "diff:rename"
    instead of making a new tag and deleting the old.
  - Tags will now be moved first, and updated and renamed later, as the new
    tag name or attributes might not be valid in the old location.
  - Changed the substitution unicode character area to use the Private Use Area
    in BMP(0), to support narrow Python builds
  - Added --unique-attributes argument.
  - A workaround for dealing with top level comments and the xml formatter
  - Added a simple ``xmlpatch`` command and API.
  - Multiple updates to documentation and code style
- deleted patches
  - xmldiff-0.6.7-clean-tmp.patch (not needed)
  - xmldiff-0.6.7-xsldata.patch (not needed)
