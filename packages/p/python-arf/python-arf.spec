%description
The Advanced Recording Format ARF is an open standard for storing
data from neuronal, acoustic, and behavioral experiments in a
portable, high-performance, archival format. The goal is to enable
labs to share data and tools, and to allow data to be accessed and
analyzed for many years in the future.

ARF is built on the the HDF5 format, and all arf files are accessible
through standard HDF5 tools, including interfaces to HDF5 written for
other languages (e.g. MATLAB, Python, etc). ARF comprises a set of
specifications on how different kinds of data are stored.
