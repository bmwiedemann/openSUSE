Wed Aug 31 10:34:08 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.8:
  - (crypto) Fixed parsing /keys/claim responses with no failures
    field.
  - (bridge) Fixed parsing e2ee key sharing allow/minimum level
    config.
  - (util.async_db) Added init_commands to run commands on
    each SQLite connection (e.g. to enable PRAGMAs). No-op on
    Postgres.
  - (bridge) Added check to make sure e2ee keys are intact on
    server. If they aren't, the crypto database will be wiped and
    the bridge will stop.
  - (bridge) Added hidden option to use appservice login for
    double puppeting.
  - (client) Fixed sync handling throwing an error if event
    parsing failed.
  - (errors) Added M_UNKNOWN_ENDPOINT error code from MSC3743
  - (appservice) Updated MSC3202 support to handle one time keys
    correctly.
  - (types) Added m.read.private to receipt types.
  - (appservice) Stopped ensure_registered and invite_user
    raising IntentErrors (now they raise the original Matrix
    error instead).
  - (bridge) Started rejecting reusing access tokens when
    enabling double puppeting. Reuse is detected by presence of
    encryption keys on the device.
  - (client.api) Added wrapper method for the /context API.
  - (api, errors) Implemented new error codes from MSC3848.
  - (types) Disabled deserializing m.direct content (it didn't
    work and it wasn't really necessary).
  - (client.state_store) Updated set_encryption_info to allow raw
    dicts. This fixes the bug where sending a m.room.encryption
    event with a raw dict as the content would throw an error
    from the state store.
  - (crypto) Fixed error when fetching keys for user with no
    cross-signing keys (thanks to @maltee1 in #109).
  - (types) Updated BeeperMessageStatusEventContent fields.
  - (api) Updated request logging to log full URL instead of only
    path.
  - (bridge) Fixed migrating key sharing allow flag to new config
    format.
  - (appservice) Added beeper_new_messages flag for batch_send
    method.
  - (crypto) Fixed Python 3.8/9 compatibility broken in v0.17.0.
  - (crypto) Added some tests for attachments and store code.
  - (crypto) Improved logging when device change validation
    fails.
  - Breaking change (bridge) Added options to check cross-signing
    status for bridge users. This requires changes to the base
    config.
        New options include requiring cross-signed devices (with
        TOFU) for sending and/or receiving messages, and an
        option to drop any unencrypted messages.
  - Breaking change (crypto) Removed sender_key parameter from
    CryptoStore's has_group_session and put_group_session, and
    also OlmMachine's wait_for_session.
  - Breaking change (crypto.store.memory) Updated the key of the
    _inbound_sessions dict to be (room_id, session_id), removing
    the identity key in the middle. This only affects custom
    stores based on the memory store.
  - (crypto) Added basic cross-signing validation code.
  - (crypto) Marked device_id and sender_key as deprecated in
    Megolm events as per Matrix 1.3.
  - (api) Bumped request logs to DEBUG level.
        Also added new sensitive parameter to the request method
        to prevent logging content in sensitive requests. The
        login method was updated to mark the content as sensitive if a
        password or token is provided.
  - (bridge.commands) Switched the order of the user ID parameter
    in set-pl, set-avatar and set-displayname.
  - (bridge) Started requiring Matrix v1.1 support from
    homeservers.
  - (bridge) Added hack to automatically send a read receipt for
    messages sent to Matrix with double puppeting (to work around
    weird unread count issues).
  - (client) Added support for knocking on rooms (thanks to
    @maltee1 in #105).
  - (bridge) Added config option to set key rotation settings
    with e2be.
  - (bridge) Updated e2be helper to stop bridge if syncing fails.
  - (util.async_db) Updated asyncpg connector to stop program
    if an asyncpg InternalClientError is thrown. These errors
    usually cause everything to get stuck.
        The behavior can be disabled by passing meow_exit_on_ice
        = false in the db_args.

    - Disabled by default, you need to set the default_retry_count field in HTTPAPI (or Client), or the default_http_retry_count field in AppService to enable.
    - Can also be enabled with HTTPAPI.request()s retry_count parameter.
    - The mautrix.util.network_retry module was removed as it became redundant.
  - Fixed GET requests having a body (#44).
