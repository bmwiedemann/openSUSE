  <title>Python bindings for the GTK+ widget set</title>
  <description>PyGTK is an extension module for python that gives you access to the
GTK+ widget set.  Just about anything you can write in C with GTK+ you
can write in python with PyGTK (within reason), but with all of
python's benefits.</description>
