%description
Packit (Packet toolkit) is a network auditing tool. It
can customize, inject, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic.
By being able to construct nearly all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP,
RARP, and Ethernet header options, Packit can be useful in testing
firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, port scanning,
simulating network traffic, and general TCP/IP auditing.
