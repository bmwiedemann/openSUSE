- Update to version 2.2.1:
  * New features
    - Minuit.profile, Minuit.mnprofile, Minuit.contour,
      Minuit.draw_profile, Minuit.draw_mnprofile, and
      Minuit.draw_contour can now be called with subtract_min=True
      even if Minuit.fmin is None.
    - iminuit.__version__ now also displays the ROOT version of
      the C++ Minuit2 library.
    - Support for adding constant numbers to cost functions, this
      allows you to write sum(cost1, cost2, ...) and may be useful
      to subtract a constant bias from the cost.
  * Other
    - Documentation improvements - Further transition to numpydoc.
    - Clarified that iminuit is based on ROOT code - List full
      iminuit version including ROOT version in docs.
    - Added type hints to many interfaces (incomplete).
    - Renamed iminuit._minuit to iminuit.minuit, making the module
      public.
    - Renamed iminuit._minimize to iminuit.minimize, making the
      module public.
    - pydocstyle added to pre-commit checks.

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * New features:
    - Cost functions in iminuit.cost are now additive, creating a
      new cost function with the union of parameters that returns
      the sum of the results of the individual cost functions.
    - iminuit.cost.NormalConstraint was added as a means to add
      soft constraints on a parameter, can also be used to set up
      a covariance matrix between several parameters.
  * Other: Documentation improvements, started transition to numpydoc
- Drop _service file and tests.tar.xz source, since tests are now
  included in the iminuit source tarball.

- Update to version 2.0.0:
  * Long list of changes, see
    <https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#december-7-2020>.
- Add _service file to download tests from github directly as they
  are not included in the pypi tarball any more
  (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#572).
- New BuildRequires: cmake >= 3.13.

- Update to version 1.5.4:
    Fixed broken sdist package in 1.5.3
- Changes from version 1.5.3:
  * Fixed a crash when throw_nan=True is used and the throw is
    triggered.
  * Add python_requires (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#496) by @henryiii.
  * Fixed buggy display of text matrix if npar != 2
    (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#493).
  * Switch extern Minuit2 repo to official root repo
    (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#500), ROOT state: a5d880a434.
  * Add ngrad and ngrad_total to FMin display, rename ncalls to
    nfcn_total (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#489).
  * Use __getattr__ to hide deprecated interface from Python
    help() (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#491).
  * Improvements to tutorials by @giammi56.
  * Show number of gradient calls in FMin display (if nonzero)
    instead of errordef value.
  * Deprecated:
    - Minuit.ncalls, use Minuit.nfcn instead
    - Minuit.ngrads, use Minuit.ngrad instead

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  - Fixed regression of the convergence rate of Minuit.migrad for
    low precision cost functions by restoring a heuristic that
    calls Migrad several times if convergence is not reached on
    first try; made this heuristic configurable with iterate
    keyword.
  - Clarify in FMin display how the EDM convergence criterion uses
    the EDM goal.
- Changes from version 1.5.1:
  - Fixed mistake in “parameter at limit” warning, which did not
    report correctly if parameter was at the upper limit.
- Changes from version 1.5.0:
  * New features
    - New more compact function minimum display with warning about
      parameters at limit.
    - Colours adjusted in HTML display to enhance contrast for
      people with color blindness.
    - Allow subclasses to use Minuit.from_array_func
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#467).
    - Nicer tables on terminal thanks to unicode characters.
    - Wrapped functions’ parameters are now recognised by iminuit.
    - Dark theme friendlier HTML style
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#481).
  * Bug-Fixes
    - Fixed reported EDM goal for really small tolerances.
    - Minuit.np_merrors now works correctly when some parameters
      are fixed.
    - Fixed HTML display of Minuit.matrix when some diagonal
      elements are zero.
  * Deprecated
    - Removed nsplit option from Minuit.migrad
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#462).

- Update to version 1.4.9:
  * Fixes an error introduced in 1.4.8 in Minuit.minos when var
    keyword is used and at least one parameter is fixed.
- Changes from versions 1.3.9 through 1.4.8: See
  https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html.
- Drop python2 builds: no longer supported upstream.
- Drop python-pytestrunner BuildRequires for test in favour of
  python-pytest.
- Fix unresolved status for Leap 15.x on account of multiple
  choices for python3-importlib-metadata
  (python3-importlib-metadata and python3-importlib_metadata).
- Simplify %check section by dropping directory renaming (no
  longer seems to be needed).
