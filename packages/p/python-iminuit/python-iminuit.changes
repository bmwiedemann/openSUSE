- Update to version 2.6.0:
  * Builtin cost functions now report the number of data points
    with the attribute Cost.ndata.
  * New attribute Minuit.ndof returns the degrees of freedom if
    the cost function reports it or NaN.
  * New attribute FMin.reduced_chi2 to report the reduced chi2 of
    the fit; returns NaN if the reduced chi2 cannot be computed
    for the cost function, in case of unbinned maximum-likelihood
    or when the attribute Cost.ndata is missing.

- Do not build for Python 3.6, due to no NumPy. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 22:53:00 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.4.0:
  * New features:
    - iminuit.minimize: Keyword method now accepts "migrad" and
      "simplex".
    - iminuit.minimize: Keyword option now supports keyword "stra"
      to set Minuit.strategy.
    - iminuit.minimize: OptimizeResult.message now states if
      errors are not reliable.
  * Minuit now supports functions wrapped with functools.partial.
  * Upgrade Minuit2 C++ code in ROOT to latest master with
    following improvements:
    - improvement of seed when using an analytical gradient.
    - fix of last minimum state added twice to vector of minimum
      states in some cases (saves a bit of memory).
  * Documentation improvements.
  * Updated tutorial about automatic differentiation, added
    comparison of numba.njit and jax.jit.
- Changes from version 2.3.0:
  * New features: iminuit.cost.BinnedNLL and
    iminuit.cost.ExtendedBinnedNLL now support weighted binned
    data.
  * Bug-fixes: FMin.edm_goal now remains unchanged if Minuit.hesse
    is run after Minuit.migrad.
  * Other: Update to cibuildwheels-1.8.0 and workflow
    simplification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 28 02:08:11 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.2.1:
  * New features
    - Minuit.profile, Minuit.mnprofile, Minuit.contour,
      Minuit.draw_profile, Minuit.draw_mnprofile, and
      Minuit.draw_contour can now be called with subtract_min=True
      even if Minuit.fmin is None.
    - iminuit.__version__ now also displays the ROOT version of
      the C++ Minuit2 library.
    - Support for adding constant numbers to cost functions, this
      allows you to write sum(cost1, cost2, ...) and may be useful
      to subtract a constant bias from the cost.
  * Other
    - Documentation improvements - Further transition to numpydoc.
    - Clarified that iminuit is based on ROOT code - List full
      iminuit version including ROOT version in docs.
    - Added type hints to many interfaces (incomplete).
    - Renamed iminuit._minuit to iminuit.minuit, making the module
      public.
    - Renamed iminuit._minimize to iminuit.minimize, making the
      module public.
    - pydocstyle added to pre-commit checks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 15:12:23 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * New features:
    - Cost functions in iminuit.cost are now additive, creating a
      new cost function with the union of parameters that returns
      the sum of the results of the individual cost functions.
    - iminuit.cost.NormalConstraint was added as a means to add
      soft constraints on a parameter, can also be used to set up
      a covariance matrix between several parameters.
  * Other: Documentation improvements, started transition to numpydoc
- Drop _service file and tests.tar.xz source, since tests are now
  included in the iminuit source tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 12 02:08:39 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.0.0:
  * Long list of changes, see
    <https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#december-7-2020>.
- Add _service file to download tests from github directly as they
  are not included in the pypi tarball any more
  (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#572).
- New BuildRequires: cmake >= 3.13.

Sun Nov 29 17:18:42 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.4:
    Fixed broken sdist package in 1.5.3
- Changes from version 1.5.3:

    triggered.
  * Add python_requires (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#496) by @henryiii.
  * Fixed buggy display of text matrix if npar != 2
    (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#493).

    instead of errordef value.

Sat Oct 31 14:20:33 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  - Fixed regression of the convergence rate of Minuit.migrad for
    low precision cost functions by restoring a heuristic that
    calls Migrad several times if convergence is not reached on
    first try; made this heuristic configurable with iterate
    keyword.
  - Clarify in FMin display how the EDM convergence criterion uses
    the EDM goal.
- Changes from version 1.5.1:
  - Fixed mistake in “parameter at limit” warning, which did not
    report correctly if parameter was at the upper limit.
- Changes from version 1.5.0:
  * New features
    - New more compact function minimum display with warning about
      parameters at limit.
    - Colours adjusted in HTML display to enhance contrast for
      people with color blindness.
    - Allow subclasses to use Minuit.from_array_func
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#467).
    - Nicer tables on terminal thanks to unicode characters.
    - Wrapped functions’ parameters are now recognised by iminuit.
    - Dark theme friendlier HTML style
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#481).
  * Bug-Fixes
    - Fixed reported EDM goal for really small tolerances.
    - Minuit.np_merrors now works correctly when some parameters
      are fixed.
    - Fixed HTML display of Minuit.matrix when some diagonal
      elements are zero.
  * Deprecated
    - Removed nsplit option from Minuit.migrad
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#462).

  https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html.
- Drop python2 builds: no longer supported upstream.
- Drop python-pytestrunner BuildRequires for test in favour of
  python-pytest.
- Fix unresolved status for Leap 15.x on account of multiple
  choices for python3-importlib-metadata
  (python3-importlib-metadata and python3-importlib_metadata).
- Simplify %check section by dropping directory renaming (no
  longer seems to be needed).
