- Update to version 2.8.3:
  * util.propagate now discriminates between diverging derivates
    (using the value NaN for the derivate) and non-converging
    derivatives (using the best value computed so far for the
    derivative).
  * Update documentation.
- Changes from version 2.8.2:
  * Minuit.draw_mncontour can now be used by passing a single
    float to keyword cl, in addition to passing a list of floats.
  * Use pybind11::ssize_t everywhere instead of non-standard
    ssize_t to fix compilation against Python-3.10 on Windows.
  * Update documentation.

- Update to version 2.8.0:
  * Minor API change: Minuit.mncontour now raises RuntimeError
    instead of ValueError if it is not called at a valid minimum
    point.
  * New features: Minuit.mncontour can now be called at any point
    without running a minimiser before, similar to Minuit.minos.
  * Fixes: Minuit.mncontour used to fail if called twice in a row.

- Update to version 2.6.1:
  * Calling Minuit.fixed[...] = False on parameter that was not
    fixed before lead to undefined behaviour in Minuit2 C++ code
    (patch submitted to ROOT).
  * Upgrade Minuit2 C++ code to latest ROOT master with simplified
    internal class structure and class tags replaced with enums.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  5 00:10:39 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmai.com>

- Update to version 2.6.0:
  * Builtin cost functions now report the number of data points
    with the attribute Cost.ndata.
  * New attribute Minuit.ndof returns the degrees of freedom if
    the cost function reports it or NaN.
  * New attribute FMin.reduced_chi2 to report the reduced chi2 of
    the fit; returns NaN if the reduced chi2 cannot be computed
    for the cost function, in case of unbinned maximum-likelihood
    or when the attribute Cost.ndata is missing.

  * Upgrade Minuit2 C++ code in ROOT to latest master with
    following improvements:
    - improvement of seed when using an analytical gradient.

Mon Dec 28 02:08:11 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.2.1:
  * New features
    - Minuit.profile, Minuit.mnprofile, Minuit.contour,
      Minuit.draw_profile, Minuit.draw_mnprofile, and
      Minuit.draw_contour can now be called with subtract_min=True
      even if Minuit.fmin is None.
    - iminuit.__version__ now also displays the ROOT version of
      the C++ Minuit2 library.
    - Support for adding constant numbers to cost functions, this
      allows you to write sum(cost1, cost2, ...) and may be useful
      to subtract a constant bias from the cost.
  * Other
    - Documentation improvements - Further transition to numpydoc.
    - Clarified that iminuit is based on ROOT code - List full
      iminuit version including ROOT version in docs.
    - Added type hints to many interfaces (incomplete).
    - Renamed iminuit._minuit to iminuit.minuit, making the module
      public.
    - Renamed iminuit._minimize to iminuit.minimize, making the
      module public.
    - pydocstyle added to pre-commit checks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 15:12:23 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  * New features:
    - Cost functions in iminuit.cost are now additive, creating a
      new cost function with the union of parameters that returns
      the sum of the results of the individual cost functions.
    - iminuit.cost.NormalConstraint was added as a means to add
      soft constraints on a parameter, can also be used to set up
      a covariance matrix between several parameters.
  * Other: Documentation improvements, started transition to numpydoc
- Drop _service file and tests.tar.xz source, since tests are now
  included in the iminuit source tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  - Fixed regression of the convergence rate of Minuit.migrad for
    low precision cost functions by restoring a heuristic that
    calls Migrad several times if convergence is not reached on

    keyword.
  - Clarify in FMin display how the EDM convergence criterion uses
    the EDM goal.
- Changes from version 1.5.1:
  - Fixed mistake in “parameter at limit” warning, which did not
    report correctly if parameter was at the upper limit.
- Changes from version 1.5.0:
  * New features
    - New more compact function minimum display with warning about
      parameters at limit.
    - Colours adjusted in HTML display to enhance contrast for
      people with color blindness.
    - Allow subclasses to use Minuit.from_array_func
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#467).
    - Nicer tables on terminal thanks to unicode characters.
    - Wrapped functions’ parameters are now recognised by iminuit.
    - Dark theme friendlier HTML style
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#481).
  * Bug-Fixes
    - Fixed reported EDM goal for really small tolerances.
    - Minuit.np_merrors now works correctly when some parameters
      are fixed.
    - Fixed HTML display of Minuit.matrix when some diagonal
      elements are zero.
  * Deprecated
    - Removed nsplit option from Minuit.migrad
      (gh#scikit-hep/iminuit#462).

  (python3-importlib-metadata and python3-importlib_metadata).
- Simplify %check section by dropping directory renaming (no
  longer seems to be needed).
