- Update to version 2.12.1:
  * cost.BarlowBeestonLite: method “hpd” has been modified to fix
    performance in cases where bins are not dominated by a single
    template.

- Update to version 2.12.0:
  * New
    - New cost function cost.BarlowBeestonLite for template fits
      with templates obtained from simulation or sWeighted data
    - Formerly private chi2 utility cost functions
      (cost.poisson_chi2, etc.), are now part of public API
    - Support custom grid in Minuit.profile, iminuit.mncontour,
      iminuit.contour
    - Handle common CL values in Minuit.mnprofile and
      Minuit.mncontour without scipy
  * Fixes
    - Skip tests that use np.float128 on platforms where this type
      is not supported

  * Documentation: New study about template fits
  * Minuit no longer warns when a function is used that has no
    errordef attribute and Minuit.errordef is not explicitly set.
    The function is assumed to be chi-square-like up to an
    arbitrary constant, unless errordef is explicitly set to
    something else.
  * More type correctness in API, better hiding of private objects
    in library
  * Add option to use external pybind11
- Pass cmake option to build against external pybind11; add
