  <title>Expand template text with embedded Perl</title>
  <description>This is a library for generating form letters, building HTML pages, or
filling in templates generally. A `template' is a piece of text that
has little Perl programs embedded in it here and there. When you `fill
in' a template, you evaluate the little programs and replace them with
their values.</description>
