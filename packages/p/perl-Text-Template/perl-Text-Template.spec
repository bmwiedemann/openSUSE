%description
This is a library for generating form letters, building HTML pages, or
filling in templates generally. A `template' is a piece of text that has
little Perl programs embedded in it here and there. When you `fill in' a
template, you evaluate the little programs and replace them with their
values.

You can store a template in a file outside your program. People can modify
the template without modifying the program. You can separate the formatting
details from the main code, and put the formatting parts of the program
into the template. That prevents code bloat and encourages functional
separation.
