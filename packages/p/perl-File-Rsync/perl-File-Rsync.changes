  	* version 0.49: fix infun, broken since 0.46 refactor
  
  	Michal Krupicka ( Michal dot Krupicka at skoda-auto dot cz ) reported
  	that I broke the the input function (it worked differently from 0.45
  	and the documentation) when I converted to using IPC::Run3.  This restores
  	compatability with 0.45. Thanks Michal.

  	* version 0.48: fix list option parsing
  
  	Bill Shunn ( proprietor at shunn dot net ) found a bug in list option
  	parsing that broke filters (and probably others as well).

  	* version 0.47: fixed hash ref parsing
  
  	Andreas Koenig ( andk at cpan dot org ) pointed out a problem
  	with the hash ref compatibility code, and then graciously provided
  	a test case to help me track down the problem. Added another
  	test to confirm.

  Wed Jul 29 09:32:05 CDT 2015 ( leakin at dfw dot nostrum dot com )
  
  	* version 0.46: added support for new options up to 3.1.1
  
  	Max Maischein ( corion at corion dot net ) provided code and
  	insight on how to support Windows OS, as well as some improved
  	tests.  IPC::Open3 was replaced with IPC::Run3 as part of this
  	effort, thanks to Max for showing me this module.  It simplified
  	a big chunk of code and I was able to take advantage of its
  	features in a few places (see infun and files-from below).
  
  	Gavin Carr ( gavin at openfusion dot com dot au ) enlightened me
  	some time ago of the advantages of ordered args with rsync.
  	Order of args is now preserved.  This is a long overdue change.
  	Rsync itself performs some things differently based on the order
  	of some args, hopefully this is a big improvement in functionality
  	and doesn't break anyone.  Passing options as a hash ref is now
  	deprecated.  Thanks Gavin, sorry it took me so long to implement.
  
  	Petya Kohts ( kohts at yandex-team dot ru ) suggested code
  	for srchost that would properly handle the rsync:// prefix
  
  	Neil Hooey ( nhooey at gmail dot com) provided a better
  	algorithm for the status method.
  
  	Erez Schatz ( moonbuzz at gmail dot com ) sent improved pod
  	formatting that should work better with pod2html
  
  	The module debug option has become moddebug so it does not conflict
  	with the rsync debug option.
  
  	infun can now be an array ref, contents are fed to stdin via IPC::Run3
  
  	files-from can also be an array ref, this is handled in the module
  	by setting infun to the array ref and --files-from='-'
  
  	Added several more tests.
