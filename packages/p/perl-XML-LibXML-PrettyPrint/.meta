  <title>Add pleasant whitespace to a DOM tree</title>
  <description>Long XML files can be daunting for humans to read. Of course, XML is
really designed for computers to read - not people - but there are times
when mere mortals do need to read and edit XML by hand. For example, if
your application stores its configuration in XML, or you need to dump some
XML to STDOUT for debugging purposes.
Syntax highlighting helps, but to really make sense of some XML, proper
indentation can be vital. Hence &quot;XML::LibXML::PrettyPrint&quot; - it can be
applied to an XML::LibXML DOM tree to reformat it into a more readable
result.
Pretty-printing XML is not as CPU-efficient as dumping it out sloppily, so
unless you're pretty sure that a human is going to need to make sense of
your XML, you should probably not use this module.
