  <title>Extend your Attribute Interfaces</title>
  <description>This distribution is deprecated. The features it provides have been added to
the Moose core code as Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native. This distribution should
not be used by any new code.

While Moose attributes provide you with a way to name your accessors, readers,
writers, clearers and predicates, this library provides commonly used attribute
helper methods for specific types of data.</description>
