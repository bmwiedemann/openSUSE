Fri Mar 17 07:58:09 UTC 2023 - Johannes Kastl <kastl@b1-systems.de>

- update to 1.4.2:
  * Officially support Python 3.11 (#3020)
    - Note: Simply upgrading to Python 3.11 can cut off 10-15% of
      your site's build time.
  * Support multiple instances of the same plugin (#3027)
  * If a plugin is specified multiple times in the list under the
    plugins: config, that will create 2 (or more) instances of the
    plugin with their own config each.
  * Previously this case was unforeseen and, as such, bugged.
  * Now even though this works, by default a warning will appear
    from MkDocs anyway, unless the plugin adds a class variable
    supports_multiple_instances = True.
  * Bugfix (regression in 1.4.1): Don't error when a plugin puts a
    plain string into warnings (#3016)
  * Bugfix: Relative links will always render with a trailing
    slash (#3022)
  * Previously under use_directory_urls, links from a sub-page to
    the main index page rendered as e.g. `<a href="../..">` even
    though in all other cases the links look like
    `<a href="../../">`. This caused unwanted behavior on some
    combinations of Web browsers and servers. Now this special-case
    bug was removed.
  * Built-in "mkdocs" theme now also supports Norwegian language
    (#3024)
  * Plugin-related warnings look more readable (#3016)
- adjust spec file to build with hatch and pyproject.toml
- update to 1.4.1:
  * Support theme-namespaced plugin loading (#2998)
  * Plugins' entry points can be named as 'sometheme/someplugin'.
    That will have the following outcome:
    - If the current theme is 'sometheme', the plugin
      'sometheme/someplugin' will always be preferred over
      'someplugin'.
    - If the current theme isn't 'sometheme', the only way to use
      this plugin is by specifying plugins: [sometheme/someplugin].
  * One can also specify plugins: ['/someplugin'] instead of
    plugins: ['someplugin'] to definitely avoid the
    theme-namespaced plugin.
  * Bugfix: mkdocs serve will work correctly with non-ASCII paths
    and redirects (#3001)
  * Windows: 'colorama' is now a dependency of MkDocs, to ensure
    colorful log output (#2987)
  * Plugin-related config options have more reliable validation
    and error reporting (#2997)
  * Translation sub-commands of setup.py were completely dropped.
    See documentation [1] [2] for their new replacements (#2990)
  * The 'mkdocs' package (wheel and source) is now produced by
    Hatch build system and pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
    (#2988)
- update to 1.4.0:
  * Large update, full changelog at
    https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/releases/tag/1.4.0
