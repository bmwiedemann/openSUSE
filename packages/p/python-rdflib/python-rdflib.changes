    * A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
      up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/
    * The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.
    * Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
      (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
      NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
      fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.
    * ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing

      empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
      a general clean-up, see: [#309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)
    * After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

Fri Dec  6 13:57:34 UTC 2013 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 4.0.1
  * Bugfixes
- Update to 4.0
  * The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should work out of the box.
  * Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
    * A new DataSet class
    * XMLLiteral and HTMLLiterals
    * BNode (de)skolemization is supported through BNode.skolemize, URIRef.de_skolemize, Graph.skolemize and Graph.de_skolemize
  * Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison (for normal == operator) and value space (using new Node.eq methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible changes, but was necessary, as the old version had inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the literals not working correctly in dicts/sets. The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works. For the full details, see:
  * Iterating over QueryResults will generate ResultRow objects, these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a dict. I.e.
  * "Slicing" of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar: (#271)
  * The SPARQLStore and SPARQLUpdateStore are now included in the RDFLib core
  * The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples for most features have been added.
- Update to 3.4
  * This release introduced new parsers for structured data in HTML. In particular formats: hturtle, rdfa, mdata and an auto-detecting html format were added. Thanks to Ivan Herman for this!
  * This release includes a lot of admin maintentance - correct dependencies for different python versions, etc. Several py3 bugs were also fixed.
  * This release drops python 2.4 compatability - it was just getting too expensive for us to maintain. It should however be compatible with any cpython from 2.5 through 3.3.
  * node.md5_term is now deprecated, if you use it let us know.

    This should avoid getting strings and other things in the store.
    https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/200
  * Added a specific TurtleParser that does not require the store to be 
    non-formula aware.

    http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/trig/

    (also fixed better by dzinxed)
  * Illegal BNode IDs removed from NT output:
