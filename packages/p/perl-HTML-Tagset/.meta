  <title>Data tables useful in parsing HTML</title>
  <description>This module contains several data tables useful in various kinds of HTML
parsing operations.

Note that all tag names used are lowercase.

In the following documentation, a &quot;hashset&quot; is a hash being used as a set
-- the hash conveys that its keys are there, and the actual values
associated with the keys are not significant. (But what values are there,
are always true.)</description>
