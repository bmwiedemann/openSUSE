    <comment>- remove dependency on abandoned (upstream) python-coards
- fix update_alternative on uninstallation
- remove check boundary condition and skip completely broken tests
- run spec-cleaner
- use %license for license
- Implement single spec version
- Update to version 3.2.2
  * Python 3.3 is no longer supported. This is in line with
    other similar projects (Numpy, Xarray, ...) and it preempts the
    expected python 3.3 EOL in September 2017.
  + Server improvements
    * Merges pydap.handlers.netcdf into the main code base
    * Adds a lightweight testing/development server
    * Rewrites the server docs to reflect a post-paster world
  + Miscellaneous bug fixes
    * Ensures Byte use is consistent with DAP2 standards
    * Fixes client authentication to UK's CEDA
    * Fixes client communcation with ERDDAP servers
    * Fixes regression bug in model.GridType (#43)
    * Fixes bug where the iteration does not replace previous_chunk
    * Fixes bugs in command-line server (#52 and #53)
  + Fix mapping scheme for SequenceType (PR #89)
    * Makes all types a mapping and protects the mapping semantics for sequence data
    * Converts dict in StructureType to OrderedDict, changing
      _original_keys handling (#3) and convers test_model.py to pytest
      semantics (#82).
    * Updats docs and docstrings. Added basic automatic
      doctests. Doctests use integers for easy continuous integration
    * 100% test coverage in src/pydap/model.py.
  + Various codebase improvements
    * Transition tests from nose to pytest
    * Tests with flake8 on all Python version
  + Adds timeout option to open_urls and open_dods
- Update to version 3.2.1
  + PyDAP client fixes
    * Adds workaround to the client when making requests to older ESGF OPENDAP servers
    * Fixes a bug where mechanicalsoup wouldn't its browser
    * Adds handling for values of -NaN
    * Overhauls URS authentication to use the requests library
    * Sets a default charset when connecting to servers that do not
  + Packaging fixes
    * Moves gunicorn in to server_extras dependency list
    * Adds test data to the release tarball
  + Code base improvements
    * Adds flake8 linting/checking to the code base
    * Improves testing for client authentication
    * Drops support for Python &lt; 2.7
    * Converts internal imports to be explicit relative
  + Miscellaneous bug fixes
    * Fixes bug in fix_slices() when `stop` &gt; len
    * Fixes unexpected flattening of sliced arrays (#41)
    * Fixes bug where attributes were not propagated to nested structures (#75)
- Update to version 3.2.0
  * Adds some optimizations to the server for DAP sequences
  * Rewrite of the client so that it's now able to stream real time data
  * Simplifies the design of handlers, eliminating DAP-related details
    (so that developers can focus only on the data parsing when creating
    new handlers).
  * Full test coverage and continuous integration
  * Adds support for Python version 3.3 through 3.5
  * Adds support for federated authentication through the Earth System
    Grid Federation (ESGF) and NASA User Registration System (URS).
  * Fixes HTML response to show all dimensions for BaseType variables
- Initial version
