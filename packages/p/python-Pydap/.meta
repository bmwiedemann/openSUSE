  <title>Pure Python Opendap/DODS client and server</title>
  <description>Pydap is an implementation of the Opendap/DODS protocol, written from
scratch. You can use Pydap to access scientific data on the internet
without having to download it; instead, you work with special array
and iterable objects that download data on-the-fly as necessary, saving
bandwidth and time. The module also comes with a robust-but-lightweight
Opendap server, implemented as a WSGI application.
