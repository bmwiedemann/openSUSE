  <title>Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter</title>
  <description>psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
language.  psycopg2 was written with the aim of being very small and fast,
and stable as a rock.

psycopg2 is different from the other database adapter because it was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
UPDATEs. psycopg2 also provide full asycronous operations and support
for coroutine libraries.</description>
