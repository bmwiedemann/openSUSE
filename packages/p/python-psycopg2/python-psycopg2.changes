    the session characteristics as it may create problems with external 
    connection pools such as pgbouncer; use BEGIN options instead (ticket #503).

  - `connection` and `cursor` objects can be used in ``with`` statements as
    context managers as specified by recent DBAPI extension.

    a database error.  Many thanks to Matthew Woodcraft for the implementation
    (ticket #149).
  - Added `connection.cursor_factory` attribute to customize the default
    object returned by `connection.cursor()`.
  - Added support for backward scrollable cursors. Thanks to Jon Nelson for
    the initial patch (ticket #108).
  - Added a simple way to customize casting of composite types into Python
    objects other than namedtuples. Many thanks to Ronan Dunklau and Tobias
    Oberstein for the feature development.

    supporting it.

  - Fixed bad interaction of ``setup.py`` with other dependencies in
    Distribute projects on Python 3 (ticket #153).

    overriding of the 'cursor_factory' argument. Thanks to Corry Haines for

    invoking a Python API function, which could cause interpreter crash.
    Thanks to Manu Cupcic for the report (ticket #110).
  - Close a green connection if there is an error in the callback. Maybe a
    harsh solution but it leaves the program responsive (ticket #113).
  - 'register_hstore()', 'register_composite()', 'tpc_recover()' work with
    RealDictConnection and Cursor (ticket #114).
  - Fixed broken pool for Zope and connections re-init across ZSQL methods in
    the same request (tickets #123, #125, #142).

    tool, which has revealed several unchecked return values, possible
    NULL dereferences, reference counting problems. Many thanks to David
    Malcolm for the useful tool and the assistance provided using it.

      it was messing with some projects using logging (and a library
      should not initialize the logging system anyway.)
    * psycopg now correctly handles time zones with seconds in the 
      UTC offset. The old register_tstz_w_secs() function is deprecated 
      and will raise a warning if called.
    * Exceptions raised by the column iterator are propagated.
    * Exceptions raised by executemany() interators are propagated.

- Add --optimize=2 to build .pyo files, correct License and Url

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 13:14:38 UTC 2009 - jfunk@funktronics.ca

- Update to 2.0.12:
  * psycopg/lobject_int.c: fixed problem with writing large data using
    lo_write: apparently the large objects code does not like non-blocking
    connections.
  * setup.py: fixed version detection for PostgreSQL rc, as
    suggested by Sok Ann Yap.
  * ZPsycopgDA/db.py: applied serialization error retry from Brian
    Sutherland.
  * Implemented connection.reset() method to reset the connection to
    well-know default parameters. This is much faster than closing and
    reopening the connection. (Suggested by a bug report by Glenn
    Maynard.)
  * psycopg/cursor_type.c: unified size macro definitions in COPY TO
    and COPY FROM operations: now the buffer for column names is 8192
    bytes that should be enough even for very large tables.
  * Applied patch from Robert Munro to fix version check
    in ZPsycopgDA.
- Release 2.0.11:
  * lib/extras.py: fixed crash in fetchone() when prefetching using
    a RealDictCursor.
  * psycopg/cursor_ext.c: now raise correct exception when fetching
    using a custom row factory results in an error.
  * lib/extras.py: applied DictRow "diet" patch from Marko Kreen.
  * setup.py: applied patch from Elvis Pranskevichus to make
    PostgreSQL version detection more robust.
