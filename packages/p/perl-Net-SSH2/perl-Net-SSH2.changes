  0.59_01  2016-04-11
          *** WARNING: this release includes lots of changes, some
              visible, most internal. Regressions are expected. Also,
              it introduces some minor backward incompatible changes -
              but in those cases, the old behavior was broken or insane
              anyway.
  
          - libssh2 version 1.7.0 is now recommended. The module would
            still compile against older versions, but not all its
            features will be available.
          - Makefile.PL has been refactored and improved. Now it is
            better able to find the library libssh2 and compile code
            using it.
          - Lots of XS code refactoring has been performed in order to
            simplify the module internals. Specifically, now typemaps
            are used extensively to convert between C and Perl
            types. Also, some complex non-performance-critical functions
            have been moved to the Perl side or broken in a high level
            Perl wrapper and a low level simpler C wrapper.
          - KnownHost methods now return undef on error instead of
            die'ing. Note that this submodule is still marked as
            experimental.
          - Die when data containing wide characters is passed
            (i.e. outside the latin1 range). In previous versions,
            methods on this module would happily accept strings
            internally encoded as latin1 or utf8 and pass then along
            untouched, resulting in unreliable behavior.
          - In 32bit perls, return offsets and file sizes as NVs when
            required to avoid overflow.
          - Method "new" now also accepts the options "compress" and
            "sigpipe".
          - Passing options to "connect" is now deprecated.
          - Passing a file descriptor number to "connect" is not
            supported anymore (it was already broken).
          - Method "connect" consistently returns undef on error. The
            error code can be retrieved calling the "error" method
            (requires libssh2 1.7.0). In previous versions, some errors
            made the method die.
          - Timeouts are handled correctly inside "connect".
          - Report EAGAIN in the same way as any other error. This
            introduces a minor backward incompatibility, but the old
            behavior was utterly insane and undocumented, and so
            probably, nobody was using it right anyway!
          - Use libssh2_session_set_last_error function for storage of
            the Perl level errors (required libssh2 1.7.0). This may
            introduce some minor backward incompatibilities, but the old
            code was broken and unreliable anyway.
