%description
Net::SSH2 is a Perl interface to the libssh2 (http://www.libssh2.org)
library. It supports the SSH2 protocol (there is no support for SSH1) with
all of the key exchanges, ciphers, and compression of libssh2.

Even if the module can be compiled and linked against very old versions of
the library, nothing below 1.5.0 should really be used (older versions were
quite buggy and unreliable) and version 1.7.0 or later is recommended.
