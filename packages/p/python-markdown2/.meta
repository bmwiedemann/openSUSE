  <title>A fast and complete implementation of Markdown in Python</title>
  <description>Markdown2 is a fast and complete Python implementation of Markdown.
It was written to closely match the behaviour of the original
Perl-implemented Markdown.pl. Markdown2 also comes with a number of
extensions (called &quot;extras&quot;) for things like syntax coloring, tables,
header-ids.</description>
