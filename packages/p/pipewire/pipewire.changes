Thu Dec 16 16:42:31 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Revert the merge of spa-plugins and modules into the library
  package.
- Move some of the files between packages where they make more
  sense.
- Rename the modules subpackage to modules-%{apiver_str} so
  it can be versioned more easily (there still are some unversioned
  files in the package, but it's a step in the right direction)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 14:03:56 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove unneccesary Conflicts with packages that are Obsoleted

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 12:32:49 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.42:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes a bug in pulse-server underrun handling that broke qemu
      and orca.
    - A fix was added to pulse-server to handle quantum changes
      gracefully.
    - Fix module-echo-cancel again.
    - Fix a bug where the bluetooth headset capture was producing
      noise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:28:10 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove the dependency on wireplumber-audio which was pulling in
  pulseaudio. We'll require wireplumber-audio directly from
  wireplumber.
- Remove pipewire-rpmlintrc since the filters don't apply anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:27:44 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Merge the pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2 and pipewire-modules
  packages into the libpipewire package just as the fedora packages
  do and simplify the filelist a bit by using some recursive
  listing instead of explicitly listing all files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 10:33:29 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Use the gcc9-c++ compiler in SLE/Leap so it builds successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 09:45:21 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.41:
  * Highlights
    - Improved compatibility for flatpaks. Flatpaks with newer
      PipeWire version can connect to an older server in all cases.
    - A new RAOP module was added to stream to Apple Airplay
      devices.
    - OBS can now capture from the monitor devices again when using
      WirePlumber.
    - Improved JACK compatibility. Improved stability in Carla and
      Ardour when changing buffer size. Improved latency
      calculations and playback latency in Ardour.
    - Improved pulse-server handling of underruns and buffer size
      changes.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - The systemd service files now have better names.
    - client.access permission checks are improved.
    - Fix some memory leaks in error paths.
    - Objects now have a global serial number that is unique for
      the lifetime of the server.
    - Make clock.rate, clock.allowed-rates and clock.quantum
      runtime tunable parameters with the settings metadata.
    - Add some additional memory checks in client-node to avoid
      sending invalid memory to clients. (#1859)
    - Improve buffer memory allocation. If one of the nodes is a
      remote node, ensure we only use memory that can be shared.
    - Version checks when binding to objects is removed. This means
      that newer clients can now bind to older servers, which is a
      typical case for a flatpak.
    - A bug in the latency calculations was fixed where it would in
      some cases report the wrong minumum latency.
  * modules
    - module-echo-cancel has voice-detection enabled now.
    - module-raop-sink and module-raop-discover to stream audio to
      an Apple Airplay device.
    - module-filter-chain now has preliminary support for LV2
      plugins.
  * SPA
    - The audio resampler now has improved buffer size
      calculations. In some cases it was too small and would cause
      distortions.
    - More checks are done when doing volume changes so that the
      channelmap is correct.
    - Audioadapter now exposes most config options with params so
      that they can be adjusted at runtime.
    - The resampler can now calculate the expected input buffer
      size before receiving the first buffer, which avoids some
      confusion when starting streams.
    - Support was added for some 10bit video formats.
    - MONO channel handling was improved.
    - Most plugins now set a clock name and this is configurable
      where it makes sense. The clock.system.monotonic clock name
      is used for most plugins that use the system clock for
      timing.
  * pulse-server
    - implement module-raop-discover
    - Use STREAM_CAPTURE_SINK property when capturing from a
      monitor source to better inform the session manager. This
      fixes some issues where OBS would capture from the
      microphone instead of the output monitor.
    - Limit the amount of cache messages to 16MB and don't add
      large memory blocks to the cache. This should fix some
      excessive memory usage that people reported.
    - Fix a potential memory leak when cleaning up a client.
    - Do some additional checks to avoid buffer overruns.
    - Improve recovery from underruns better. (#1857) This improves
      seeking in gnome-music.
    - Improve recovery when the quantum is forced larger that the
      stream configured latency.
    - The prebuf state is now handled correctly.
  * JACK
    - A per type object cache is now implemented. This ensures that
      port objects remain valid for a longer time because many JACK
      applications inspect objects after they are destroyed. This
      improves catia/carla compatibility.
    - Recompute the latencies when the buffer-size changes. Fix
      some cases where we would end up with negative latencies.
    - Handle regcomp errors to avoid some crashes later.
    - Latency calculations are improved a lot.
    - More care is taken to not call a process callback while a
      buffer size change is pending. This fixes some crashes in
      Carla, which expect that all clients are paused when one
      handles the buffersize callback.
    - Loopback links to a client are now handled correctly and
      without latency. This fixes playback latency in ardour6
      (#1839)
  * ALSA
    - ALSA devices now keep track of the samplerate of the card
      and ensure that all PCM use the same rate. This is a
      workaround for a kernel bug that is fixed in 5.16.
    - Refactor the ALSA plugin a little.
    - The ALSA plugin now reports correct delay for a capture PCM.
      (#1697)
    - The ALSA nodes now expose all config options with params
      that can be changed at runtime.
    - The ALSA node has a configurable clock name. Adaptive
      resampling to match clock rates is avoided when the driver
      has the same clock name as the ALSA node. This can be used
      to link alsa devices together with a word clock.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 16:21:56 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Drop server packages from baselibs.conf. Only the client parts
  are needed in there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 10 09:31:47 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Minor aesthetic changes in the spec file 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 12:14:23 UTC 2021 - Neal Gompa <ngompa@opensuse.org>

- Enable AAC support for Leap 15.4+

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 11:33:29 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Replace the Recommends wireplumber to a Suggests since there's
  already a Require dependency on a pipewire-session-manager and
  when in doubt the Suggested package is selected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 10:34:27 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Unconditionally enable AAC support now that fdk-aac-free is in
  Factory (adapted from SR 936225 by Neal Gompa
  <ngompa@opensuse.org>)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  3 09:06:42 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Makes sure if we're using wireplumber and pulseaudio that
  we don't enable the audio devices in pipewire by requiring
  wireplumber-audio or pulseaudio if wireplumber is installed

- Better integration with PulseAudio (bsc#1188516) made by tiwai:
  * Add Requires pulseaudio-setup package for the extra setups
    in the %post section
  * Add the missing Recommends alsa-plugins-pulse to
    pipewire-pulseaudio package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 12:47:56 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.40:
  * Highlights:
    - Producers and consumers can now incrementally negotiate a
      format by narrowing down the options. This can be used to
      select an optimal combination of format and modifiers.
    - Driver nodes such as the consumer of a headless compositor
      can now throttle the speed based on a new trigger_done event.
    - Headless compositors can now signal a damage event to
      consumers to start the processing of the graph.
    - Compatibility improvements in JACK.
    - Draining and resuming is now working correctly in pulse and
      alsa.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire:
    - Many BSD fixes.
    - clang compilation fixes.
    - Fix map implementation on big-endian machines.
    - Improve tracking of param changes in pw-stream.
    - Add support for renegotiation. With this change, producer and
      consumer can incrementally renegotiate a format until it is
      fixed. This will be used to do complex negotiation of DRM
      modifiers.
    - Add a trigger-done event in the stream. This can be used to
      know when processing of the complete graph has finished after
      issuing a trigger_process() and it can be used to throttle
      processing.
    - Add a RequestProcess node event and command. This can be used
      by non-driver nodes to suggest to a driver to start
      processing. One case is where a compositor can emit this
      event as a result of a screen update to let the headless
      compositor start an update.
    - Fix zeroconf sample format.
    - pw-mon outputs to stderr now and has colors.
  * SPA:
    - Fix compilation on ppc and armv7.
    - Fix port type check for ALSA seq midi ports so that they are
      not falsely listed as hardware.
    - Fix crash when running SSE code on unsupported HW.
    - The libcamera plugin was rewritten. It now supports hotplug,
      format enumeration and an easier to read codebase.
    - Fix compatibility some more for cards with 64 channels.
  * pulse-server:
    - Flush data in pause in combine-sink to avoid stray audio
      fragments.
    - Fix a race where not all objects were removed correctly.
    - The latency calculations and setup was improved to more
      closely match pulseaudio behaviour. PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC should
      now resemble pulseaudio more closely.
    - The drained reply is now sent only once and new data will be
      accepted once the drain completes.
    - Fix a potential crasher bug where the stream started
      processing before the setup was completed.
    - The server will now drop the client connections when the
      pipewire connection is lost.
  * JACK:
    - Rework the jack_port_get_buffer() method to return the same
      memory when called multiple times during the process()
      callback. This makes things work on a new Hydrogen.
    - Add an option to disable showing the monitor ports.
    - JACK ports are now sorted per node/client and port_id. This
      should more closely match JACK behaviour and avoid random
      port order.
  * v4l2:
    - Fix v4l2 LD_PRELOAD script.
    - Make sure we destroy the proxy when the global is destroyed.
  * ALSA:
    - _prepare should exit the draining state.
    - Fix the precision of the _delay function by taking into
      account the amount of queued samples are the correct
      samplerate.
- Drop patches fixed upstream:
  * 0001-cpu-fix-compilation-on-some-architectures.patch
  * 0001-map-make-_insert_at-fail-on-a-removed-item.patch
  * 0002-map-use-uintptr_t-for-the-next-pointer.patch

  built in Leap15.3/SLE15-SP3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 10:10:40 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Fix %systemd_user_post using the now separated
  pipewire-media-session.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 09:27:57 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.39
  * Highlights
    - media-session is now moved into a separate module to speed up
      its deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
    - There is now an LD_PRELOAD v4l2 emulation library to run some
      existing v4l2 applications on top of PipeWire.
    - Filter-chains should now flush out remaining samples when
      paused. There is now also the option to let a filter-chain
      drain so that long filters
    such as reverbs can fade out properly.
    - Stability and compatibility improvements in JACK apps.
    - Better Bluetooth compatibility with more devices.
    - libcamera plugin improvements.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements all over the map.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix compilation on ARM.
    - Log topics are added to most modules.
    - Documentation updates. Many improvements to the layout.
      Reorganisation of the modules and groups.
    - Share a work queue for all links and nodes. This removes the
      need for a separate eventfd per link and per node.
    - Catch errors in the map implementation.
    - Add option to compile without dbus support.
    - Fix biquad frequency. It was using the wrong sample rate.
    - Fix a potential crash when destroying nodes, in some cases
      the node would not be deactivated properly.
    - Add some more helpers for dealing with properties and their
      values.
    - Implement flush and reset on virtual sinks/sources.
    - Make it possible to let virtual sinks/filter-chains run and
      drain after being idle.
    - Fix a bug where the quantum could exceed the maximum because
      it was scaled with the sample rate.
    - Fix channel_map parsing in module-zeroconf-discover so that
      the remote channel map is used.
    - pw-stream errors emitted on the proxy are reported but not
      fatal any more. They are usually used by the session manager
      to signal status to the client but otherwise does not really
      cause an error on the client.
    - Links now also store the output and input node id in the
      global properties so that applications can parse and use them
      regardless of how the link was made. (#1723)
    - pw-stream and pw-filter now have an event to notify commands.
    - The echo-cancel module can now operate on larger quantums.
    - pw-cat now uses the right metadata to find the default
      devices in --list-targets.
  * media-session
    - Don't try to remix unpositioned streams when linking. This
      ensures that linking to Pro-Audio nodes does not remix the
      stream channels but links them as they are, one by one.
    - media-session is now moved to a separate module to accelerate
      its deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
  * SPA
    - Many libcamera improvements, handle MemFd buffers, handle
      errors gracefully.
    - Small improvements to make interface fall-backs easier to
      implement.
    - Add support to enable flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero
      to avoid high CPU usage when dealing with denormals.
    - AUX13 channels are no longer reported as AUX12. (#1727)
    - Devices with more than 32 channels in Pro-Audio mode now only
      uses AUX channels.
    - Improve windowing function of the resampler to reduce
      aliasing and improve the quality.
  * JACK
    - Port connect callbacks will not only be emitted after the
      port has negotiated buffers, which improves compatibility
      with applications that try to use the port right after the
      callback (jack_midi_latency_test).
    - Fix crash when midi ports were removed and being monitored,
      like in Ardour.
  * pulse-server
    - The pulse tunnel will now use the specified
      format/rate/channels.
    - Improve lookup of default source and fall back to the
      monitors when no sources are available.
    - Mark some nodes as network nodes so that we can set the
      NETWORK flag correctly.
  * GStreamer
    - The GStreamer element not releases the buffers in the stream
      again in all cases so that they can be reused by other
      streams.
  * v4l2
    - Add a v4l2 LD_PRELOAD library to emulate v4l2 system calls on
      top of PipeWire. This is tested with firefox and GStreamer
      and is known to not work with Chrome.
  * Bluetooth
    - AAC compatibility improvements.
    - Disable hardware volume for "Tribit MAXSound Plus" and
      "SoundCore mini".
    - Add quirk to disable faststream. Disable faststream on
      "FiiO BTR3".
    - Add a dummy AVRCP player to improve compatibility with some
      devices.
- Remove patch:
  * 0001-fix-compilation-on-ARM.patch
- Add patch from upstream:
  * 0001-cpu-fix-compilation-on-some-architectures.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 09:10:51 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix compilation on ARM (boo#1191600):
  * 0001-fix-compilation-on-ARM.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 30 10:03:37 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.38:
  * Highlights
    - Topic based logging was added to improve debugging.
    - An off-by-one error was fixed in the audio resampler that could
      cause distortion when downsampling.
    - Various bluetooth compatibility improvements.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - module-pulse-tunnel now has better default latency to make it work
      better in more cases. There is also an option to configure the
      desired latency.
    - pw-cli now has readline support.
    - Topic based logging was added. Log lines can now be filtered by
      topic using wildcards. This should improve debugging.
    - The systemd service files should now have better descriptions.
    - Fix a crash in module-zeroconf-discover when unloading.
    - Fix a crash in filter-chain when using unaligned memory.
  * ALSA
    - Sync the udev rules and profiles with pulseaudio.
    - Fix a memory leak.
  * SPA plugins
    - An off-by-one error was fixed in the resampler that could cause
      distortion when downsampling. (#1646)
  * Bluetooth
    - Avoid probing the native backend because it might block for DBus
      activation. This fixes some long startup times.
    - Fix the kernel version check, 5.14.x kernels should also support
      mSBC.
    - Fix FastStream microphone support in more cases.
    - Add workaround for Intel AX200.
    - SCO sink should now also work in follower mode.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Make the service file require a session manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 29 18:51:13 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(readline) so pw-cli is built with
  readline support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 09:20:46 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.37:
  * Highlights
    - Capture and playback is now avoided even more on unavailable
      devices. This should fix some issues where an unusable
      microphone was selected by default. It should now also again
      be possible to select an unavailable device as the default.
    - Native DSD audio playback is now supported. pw-cat can now
      also play DSF files with the -d option.
    - JACK stability improvements with buffer-size and samplerate
      changes in some apps.
    - Many cleanups and bugfixes all over the place.
  * PipeWire
    - pw-metadata -d does not cause an infinite loop anymore.
      (#1622)
    - Increase some plugin buffer sizes to fix some issues with
      many channels. (#1620)
    - Protect the global plugin list with a lock. Make sure
      pw_init() is locked. Fixes some issues with concurrent ALSA
      plugin usage.
  * media-session
    - Unavailable devices can be set as the default again. (#1624)
    - Do a better check if a device has available routes and avoid
      selecting devices with unavailable routes as default.
    - Media-session was moved to its own directory. It used to live
      in examples but it is past the example stage and it
      interferes with the build options for the real examples.
  * Bluetooth
    - The hardware quirk database is now loaded by the plugin
      instead of the session manager. This makes it also work with
      wireplumber.
  * ALSA
    - The ALSA mixer now handles device removal much better.
      (#1627)
  * libcamera
    - Many fixes and improvement to the libcamera plugin. (#1513)
  * pulse-server
    - Improve compatibility with pulseaudio module arguments.
    - Parse channel_map arguments in module-loopback. (#1486)
  * JACK
    - Delay emiting the samplerate and buffersize callbacks until
      the client is active. This fixes some crashes with Carla and
      other JACK apps.

- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-media-session-dont-use-after-free-if-linking-node-removed.patch
  * 0002-update-version-number-as-well.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 20 06:51:15 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patches from upstream to fix an "use-after-free" error and
  to set the version number correctly:
  * 0001-media-session-dont-use-after-free-if-linking-node-removed.patch
  * 0002-update-version-number-as-well.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 14:23:44 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.36:
  * Highlights
    - A quick update with mostly only bugfixes and small
      improvements.
    - Capture and playback is now avoided on unavailable devices.
      This should fix some issues where an unusable microphone was
      selected by default.
    - MIDI output should not stop randomly now.
    - The GStreamer elements are much improved, cheese should work
      a lot better now.
    - Virtual sinks and sources should now always show up
      immediately.
    - JACK processing is now delayed until buffersize and
      samplerate are emited. This should improve stability of many
      JACK apps.
    - JACK transport sync is now implemented correctly so that
      preroll in bitwig works.
  * PipeWire
    - The module dir environment variable can now contain multiple
      paths.
    - Documentation now contains dot graphs of dependencies.
      (#1585)
    - config min/max/default quantum values are now scaled with the
      samplerate.
    - A potential crash was fixed where destroyed memory was still
      used by a node. This could cause crashes in cheese.
  * pipewire-media-session
    - Only allow passthrough for passthrough formats (S/PDIF) for
      now. (#1587)
    - Improve bluetooth profile autoswitch.
    - Don't try to route audio to nodes with unavailable routes.
  * ALSA
    - Pass the right AES bits to the alsa device when opening an
      S/PDIF stream.
    - Fix a bug in the MIDI bridge port management logic. When a
      port was added and immediately removed, output would stop.
  * GStreamer
    - The GStreamer source now handles the flushing state
      correctly.
    - All blocking operations now have a 30 seconds timeout, to
      avoid infinite locks.
  * Plugins
    - V4l2 Device formats and controls are now passed on the node,
      just like with audio devices.
    - audioconvert now also exposes the softMute property.
  * JACK
    - Improve stability when changing buffer size and sample rate
      dynamically by pausing the processing until the application
      has handled the callback.
    - Improve handling of timebase master. When the master was
      moved to another driver, it did not attempt to become a new
      timebase master on the new driver. (#1589)
    - Implement transport sync to make preroll in bitwig work.
      (#1589)
  * pulse-server
    - Fix an issue where virtual sinks/sources would not show up
      immediately. (#1588)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  9 08:49:42 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.35:
  * Highlights:
    - S/PDIF passthrough over optical or HDMI is now implemented.
    - Some critical fixes to MIDI, draining of streams and various
      modules.
    - skypeforlinux should work better now after adding it to the
      quirks database.
    - Bluetooth codecs are now in separate plugins to make it
      easier to ship them.
  * PipeWire: 
    - Drain was fixed in pw-stream. In some cases it would not
      clear the drain state correctly. Fixes the issue where
      speaker-test would only play one channel.
    - Loopback connections to a driver will now activate the
      driver. This fixes an issue where MIDI connections between
      devices or some applications (puredata) would not get any
      MIDI messages. (#1559)x.
    - The audiomixer can now mix more formats. Together with the
      passthrough improvements this can be used to avoid
      conversions to/from the DSP format in some cases.
    - Make sure we idle drivers when removing a node from it in all
      cases. JACK clients could keep a driver node busy.
    - Add new methods to accumulate object info. The old one was
      difficult to use when applications need to accumulate
      multiple changes.
    - A new interface to load modules has been added. Plugins can
      use this to ask the host (PipeWire) to load spa plugins.
    - Increase param buffer size to handle larger params. Nodes
      with a large number of channels would sometimes not have
      properties. (#1574)
    - Concurrent link negotiation that caused some links to not
      work, is now avoided. This fixes monitor ports in Ardour6.
    - Small tweaks to how the quantum and rate are handled when
      nodes move between drivers. Make node.lock-quantum work with
      node.latency
  * PipeWire modules:
    - The convolver plugin in filter-chain has been optimized some
      more.
    - The echo-cancel stream properties were improved so that it
      actually can remember the streams it links to. (#1557)
    - module-pulse-tunnel had the buffer attributes wrong and would
      cause high latency with older pulseaudio servers. (#1434)
    - module-roc had the properties configured wrongly, which would
      cause it to not work at all in most cases. (#1538)
    - There is now an example of a 7.1 virtual surround sink using
      the hesuvi impulse responses.
    - The convolver now supports dirac pulses as the IR.
  * ALSA:
    - UCM config is now cached per device, using up less memory. It
      also temporarily works around a problem in alsa-lib that is
      now being patched and rolled out. Should stop devices from
      disappearing when logging out and back in. (#1553)
    - Fix the MIDI clock rate matching. It was too sensitive to
      small changes and would spiral out of control and break MIDI
      rather quickly.
  * pipewire-media-session:
    - The media session can now save and restore IEC958 (S/PDIF)
      codecs for the sinks.
    - Passthrough of IEC958 (S/PDIF) content is now possible. If
      the client and the sink contain a compatible set of codecs,
      an exclusive connection can be made between client and sink to pass
      the encoded S/PDIF content directly to the device.
    - Use new introspection info update methods to suspend nodes in
      all cases. Sometimes, nodes would fail to suspend because the
      state info was not evaluated.
    - The media session can now work in non-DSP mode, which will
      try to avoid any audio conversions between client and device
      when possible. But, this will also disable compatibility with
      JACK applications.
  * Bluetooth
    - Bluetooth codecs are now compiled into separate plugins which
      are dynamically loaded. This makes it possible to change the
      plugin implementation or ship plugins separately without
      having to recompile the bluetooth module.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Delay stream create reply until the stream is linked to a
      sink/source.
    - The device-restore extension is now implemented. This makes
      it possible to configure the IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs supported
      by the sink with pavucontrol.
    - skypeforlinux now uses the same quirks as teams to make the
      sinks show up in all cases. This fixes the issue of not being
      able to hear the remote end in skypeforlinux.
  * JACK
    - Improve catia and carla compatibility by caching objects a
      little longer after being removed. (#1531)
    - JACK ports now notify the negotiated format correctly.
    - A potential deadlock was fixed when multiple threads would
      perform a call that would require a roundtrip.
    - Improve bufsize callback, it should not be called right after
      doing activate() but only when the buffersize changes later.
    - Add tweak to disable the process lock. Some older apps might
      not expect it. (#1576)
  * Docs
    - man pages are now generated with rst2man.
    - DMA-BUF docs were updated.
    - Documentation updates.
- Replace BuildRequires xmltoman with docutils (rst2man)
- Update libcamera Buildrequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 08:33:01 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libcap) since it's being searched
  by the build scripts.
- Replace BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libopenaptx) with libfreeaptx
  since openaptx has a license issue
- Use bcond_with to enable/disable the usage of libcamera
  (the defaults are not changed: it's disabled in Leap since
  upstream doesn't recommend enabling it yet and enabled in TW
  since we can allow some experimental support there)
- Changes suggested by darix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 26 12:27:15 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.34:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes some critical issues with previous release. Such as
      devices not showing up and default devices being lost.
    - Support for consumer driver streams to make the producer
      v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless compositor
      setup.
    - Improvements to routing of streams.
    - Bluetooth battery status support for head-set profile and
      using Apple extensions. aptX-LL and FastStream codec support
      was added.
    - Internal latency of ALSA devices can now be configured.
    - A fast convolver was added to the filter-chain to implement
      virtual surround sinks or reverbs.
  * PipeWire
    - Add support for streams that are driver nodes for the graph.
      This was already possible for source streams but it is now
      also possible for playback streams. This can be used to let
      a producer v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless
      compositor setup. (#1484)
    - State files are now stored in XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
      XDG_CONFIG_HOME. They will still be loaded from the config
      home if they are not in the new state home, to ease
      migration.
    - Set a driver on inactive nodes to make transport work in
      xjadeo. (#1491)
    - Fix parsing of filter-chain controls.
    - A new FFT based convolver was added to module-filter-chain.
      It uses a 0-latency 2 stage convolver with small FFT for the
      head and a large FFT for the tail of the convolution. A
      convolution can be used to implement IR based reverbs, HRIR
      surround sound or other convolution based operations. An
      example HRIR virtual surround sound sink has been added as
      well.
    - module-filter-chain was reworked a bit to support more config
      options for the plugins.
    - Endian conversion and alaw/ulaw formats are now supported for
      streams.
    - pw-cat will now suggest a samplerate for the graph.
    - SPA_PLUGIN_DIR can now search in multiple paths separated
      with a ':'.
    - Passthrough mode has been worked on and has been partially
      merged. S/PDIF definitions have been added and ALSA devices
      updated to report and configure S/PDIF formats. The session
      manager changes to fully configure and enable passthrough
      mode will hopefully be merged next time.
    - Fix a race in pw-stream where it would not always emit the
      right events.
  * ALSA
    - Fix volume changed check. It was checking against the wrong
      value and this could cause rounding errors.
    - The ALSA plugin now also uses RT scheduling.
    - Fix the behringer UMC202 usb device id, it was using a
      generic TI chip ID that caused problems.
    - Fix USB devices that don't show up anymore. Use an ALSA
      workaround to fix this. (#1478)
    - Add a rule for the new firmware of Sennheiser GSX 1200.
    - ALSA sink and source can now use ProcessLatency param to
      configure the internal latency. The latencyOffsetNsec
      property is also exposed so that the latency can be adjusted
      in pavucontrol as well.
  * media-session
    - Fix a critical issue where the default device was not
      remembered anymore when it was removed.
    - Fix the issue where some apps need to be restarted when
      nodes go away and reappear.
    - Improve routing of streams. Streams that have a specific
      target set will now be moved to the target when it appears
      instead of staying on the fallback.
    - Small memory leak fixes.
    - Try to switch back to the user selected profile after
      finishing a Bluetooth recording.
  * Bluetooth
    - Add support for HF indicator 2 battery status.
    - Add support for XAPL battery status.
    - Set the Communication intended role for HFP profile.
    - Enable SBC-XQ by default if not disabled by quirks.
    - Fix some potential crashes due to excessive polling.
    - Add aptx-LL codec and enable duplex for aptx-LL devices.
    - Add FastStream codec. This is a codec that can use a
      duplex SBC channel.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Suggests a samplerate for the graph.
    - Support for handling S/PDIF (IEC958) formats was added. This
      will start working when the session manager supports
      configuring streams and nodes in passthrough mode.
    - Be smarter when handling devices without a negotiated format
      yet so that they are visible as well. This makes virtual
      devices show up immediately.
  * ALSA plugin
    - Now suggests a samplerate for the graph.
  * JACK
    - The jack.pc file can only be generated with meson >= 0.59.0.
      When the jack-devel option is enabled, it will generate an
      error with older meson.
    - Small stability improvements when connecting/disconnecting in
      Ardour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  5 14:54:31 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.33:
  * Highlights
    - Better support for virtual sinks/sources for Pro Audio
      profile.
    - Better DMA-BUF format modifier negotiation.
    - Support multiple sample rates in the graph. Not enabled
      by default yet.
    - Bluetooth can now automatically switch between headset
      and audio profile.
    - Documentation updates.
    - Many improvements and crasher fixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Make AUX channels an official channel map, use this for the
      PRO audio profile so that we can name the channels. This
      make it possible to define virtual sources and sinks for
      Pro Audio devices in a more reliable way.
    - Fix scheduling of some virtual sinks/sources. (#1407)
    - Fix potential corruption of ringbuffer because of multiple
      concurrent writers. This might be the cause for many reported
      crashes. (#1451)
    - Don't place sockets in $HOME. (#1443)
    - Improve DMA-BUF negotiation. Add a flag to avoid fixation
      of a property so that producers can negotiate more
      efficiently. This is used to negotiate DMA-BUF modifiers,
      which should make more efficient use of the GPU. (#1084)
    - Add support for multipe sample rates. The graph can switch
      when IDLE to one of the supported rates. Add an option to
      lock the rate as well. This is not enabled by default yet
      because of driver bugs that need to be worked around first.
    - Add node.lock-quantum property that can be used to lock the
      quantum in place.
    - Improve latency reporting in the loopback module.
    - Make new client-node method to send the peer port id to the
      mixer. This can be used to know where the buffers entering the
      mixer are coming from. (#1471)
  * Tools
    - pw-top should now also correctly show bluetooth devices.
      (#1540)
  * media-session
    - Handle unset of the default node.
    - Added a module that can switch the bluetooth profile to headset
      profile when a stream wants to record from it.
  * JACK
    - Only call the jack callbacks when the client is active. Some
      JACK applications don't expect callbacks before the client is
      active and crash (x42-dpl). (#1461)
    - Emit client unregister event.
    - Add per-client match rules in the config file to set app
      specific configuration and tweaks. (#1456)
    - Use peer_id to implement jack_port_get_buffer() from one of
      our peer ports to get the data before it enters the mixer.
      Makes the capture monitors work in Ardour6.8. (#1471)
  * Bluetooth
    - Add some broken kernel versions to the mSBC blocklist
    - Avoid looping and consuming CPU when we can't write to the
      BT socket.
    - Use libfreeaptx instead of libopenaptx.
    - Fix rounding errors in HW volume conversion.
  * PulseAudio server
    - implement module-switch-on-connect to emulate pulseaudio
      behaviour of new devices. Some desktop environments expect
      this behaviour and break otherwise.
    - Fix stream cleanup, make sure the stream is stopped before
      destroying it. Might be cause for some of the reported
      crashes.
    - Update message API to use the JSON format.
  * Other
    - Many documentation updates.
    - Many cleanups and small improvements.
    - Support the latest libcamera version. (#1435)
- Drop pipewire-fix-libcamera-build.patch, merged upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 06:23:36 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Move with-{alsa,jack,pulseaudio} from the media-session package
  to the packages that implement each support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 22 07:55:13 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Add patch pipewire-fix-libcamera-build.patch: fix build with
  latest libcamera.
- Do no build libcamera support on Leap 15.3 or lower (too old
  libcamera) and change name of BuildRequires from camera to
  libcamera.
- Update minimal version for alsa buildrequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 20 12:46:57 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.32:
  * Highlights
    - Real-time priority handling for threads was reworked.
      Freewheeling will now drop RT priorities to avoid being
      killed.
    - Problems with filter chains and echo-cancel being linked in
      a loop was fixed.
    - alsamixer should now be able to see the mixer controls again.
    - JACK has seen some latency reporting improvements that make
      Ardour report latencies correctly.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a bug in the neon audio resampler code.
    - There is now a node.link-group property to relate linked
      streams. this can be used to track the dataflow with
      coupled streams.
    - Fix a crash when recalculating latency on a destroyed
      port. (#1371)
    - Filter chains and other modules that create streams can
      now also be added to the daemon config itself. (#1309)
    - Fix some potential deadlocks in timerfd. (#1377)
    - Feedback links are skipped when recalculating latency to
      avoid loops.
    - The dummy driver and null-sink now stop the timerfd when
      following another driver instead of generating useless
      graph wakeups.
    - rt.limit was increased to 2 seconds. Some applications got
      killed because they run lengthy code in the Real-Time
      thread. (#1344)
    - Fix s24_32 to float, it was not sign extending
      properly. (#1393)
    - The performance of the feedback loop check algorithm was
      improved a lot, making complex graphs start much much faster.
    - The zeroconf publish module now doesn't republish nodes
      every time the volume changes. (#1406)
    - A potential memory corruption error has been fixed in the
      loop that could cause random crashes.
    - Mempools can now be created from multiple threads at the
      same time.
  * media-session
    - Loops in coupled streams are now avoided. (#1394)
    - Port changes for inactive profiles are ignored now by
      the default-route module. (#1403)
  * ALSA
    - Make sure tha alibpref is not part of the device node name
      because it is random. (#1362)
    - Fixed an off-by-one that could cause midi events to end up
      with a wrong timestamp and thus being discarded by
      some apps. (#1395)
    - Fix some memory leaks when destroying a card object.
  * JACK
    - Fix some invalid cycle wakeups that could cause JACK
      application to run with a 0 buffer size. (#1386)
    - JACK can now use rtkit to manage realtime priorities
      on threads.
    - The Real-time priority is dropped when entering freewheel
      mode to make sure we don't get killed when using
      too much CPU.
    - jack_recompute_total_latencies() is now implemented, fixing
      the latency reporting in Ardour. (#1388)
    - Fix some overflows in time calculations.
    - Ensure frame_rate in position is never 0.
    - Graph callbacks are now emitted as well.
  * Bluetooth
    - RTP payload type is now set correctly for aptX, LDAC and
      SBC, which should improve compatibility with devices that
      care about this.
  * PulseAudio server
    - There is now a quirks database to deal with bad clients.
      The database is builtin but can be made external later.
          Teams is now lied to and told all sink/sources use
          s16 samples to make it show all sinks/sources.
          Firefox is forced to remove the DONT_MOVE flag on
          capture streams so that you can move firefox streams
          with other tools.
    - The UNDERFLOW warnings are now made into info log messages
      to not spam the log too much. Many application just let
      things underrun and PulseAudio did not warn about this
      either. (#910)
  * ALSA plugin
    - The alsa plugin now uses the right metadata for finding the
      default source and sink, which makes the volume controls
      reappear. (#1384)
  * Other
    - Cleanups in pulse-server and pipewire.
    - Documentation additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 14:52:35 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Make the jack replacement libraries really replace jack libraries
  just like Fedora does (adding the path to the pipewire
  replacement libraries to ld.so.conf.d and conflicting with jack).
- Remove the spec code that forced the packages not to provide the
  jack libraries. They seem to be ready to replace jack libraries
  now.
- Add a pipewire-libjack-0_3-devel package with development files
  for pipewire's jack replacement.
- Enable the libcamera module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 29 06:12:36 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %pre and %post sections to the new media-session subpackage.
- Move the references to the media-session service from the
  workaround in pipewire's %post section to the workaround in the
  new subpackage's %post section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 28 16:14:29 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.31:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes for alsa-lib 1.2.5
    - New pulseaudio modules: module-avahi-zeroconf,
      module-pipe-source, module-roc-sink, module-roc-source
    - JACK has seen massive stability improvements. Locking
      and correctness wrt to callbacks and has been reworked. Also
      thread priorities have improved.
    - Handle various crashes and lockups when running out of file
      descriptors.
    - Bluetooth now uses a hardware database to disable
      non-working features on listed devices.
    - Scheduling quantum and rate can now be changed dynamically
      with pw-metadata.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Improve cleanup of context in error cases.
    - There is now a pw-test framework for improved unit tests.
    - Improve property serialization to valid JSON.
    - Fix some macros to work with better with coverity.
    - Metadata permissions are checked now. Clients need the
      M permission on an object to be able to set metadata for
      it.
    - The core metadata object will now remove metadata for
      removed objects, the implementor does not need to worry
      about that anymore.
    - Audioadapter will now follow the rate of the graph with
      the resampler adjusting itself dynamically.
    - Core now has a metadata implementation helper. A context
      will expose a metadata with settings that can be changed
      at runtime. This can be used to change the lowlevel or
      graph quantum and samplerate on the fly.
    - An infinite loop was fixed in the audio converter.
    - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully. Handle truncated
      control data by dropping the client connection.
    - Fix profiler crash with many streams.
    - Improve latency handling in pw-filter. There is now a
      default handler and a ProcessLatency parameter to simplify
      latency reporting.
    - Latency reporting was improved in devices and streams.
    - And example sink/source was added.
  * ALSA
    - hardware mute and volume are now properties on the
      Route param to make things easier.
    - More fixes for alsa-ucm 1.2.5.
  * Tools
    - spa-json-dump now properly encodes string and keys
    - pw-dump now shows the correct subject of the metadata.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Ensure the node.description is set, some applications
      crash otherwise (TeamSpeak).
    - Module loading and unloading was improved.
    - module-avahi-zeroconf was implemented.
    - module-pipe-source was implemented
    - module-roc-sink and module-roc-source was implemented
    - The maximum amount of connections has been limited to 64,
      like pulseaudio.
    - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully.
    - Fix overflow of read/write pointers.
    - source and sink state are now decoupled from the monitor
      state and will report IDLE when not playing anything.
  * media-session
    - Port switching should now happen to/from the port that
      actually changed.
  * JACK
    - The locking was reviewed. All callbacks are not emited
      from the PipeWire thread with the lock released and
      the process function will be disabled for the duration
      of the callback. This ensures that no two callbacks are
      called at the same time.
    - Improve internal consistency and try to never call callbacks
      with invalid objects.
    - Monitor port can now be accessed with system:monitor_%d
    - client threads are now created with SCHED_FIFO and module-rt
      is used to create the other RT threads. This should avoid
      SIGKILL from RTKit in some cases.
  * Bluetooth
    - Various bugfixes to improve connections to devices.
    - Handle delayed UUID connection.
    - There is now a hardware database that can disable features
      in listed devices.
    - Use libusb to detect availability of mSBC.
  * ALSA
    - The virtual device name can now also contain a media role.

- Add BuildRequires(libusb-1.0) to detect mSBC support for Bluetooth.
- Move media-session to a separate package (similar to Fedora),
  allowing to switch to another session manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 13 17:35:06 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- added pipewire-alsa to baselibs.conf
  pipewire-alsa-32bit is needed to run BIT.TRIP Runner 2 from Steam,
  which is a 32bit application and uses ALSA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 10 11:08:24 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Move %{_udevrulesdir}/90-pipewire-alsa.rules to the main pipewire
  package (boo#1187108)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Jun  3 13:01:45 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.29
  * Highlights
    - Latency reporting is now implemented.
    - Many documentation updates and cleanups.
    - module-combine-sink was added to PulseAudio server.
    - Better handling of multichannel input profiles.
    - Fix 100% volume issue when monitor suspends or profile
      changes in some cases.
    - Bugfixes and crashes
  * PipeWire
    - A new module-rt was added to acquire real-time scheduling
      priviledges without using RTKit.
    - Documentation fixes and updates. Docs are now using a
      custom theme.
    - There is now a MANDATORY flag on properties that influence
      how properties are filtered.
    - Filter-chain now parses the LADSPA_PATH correctly when it
      contains a colon separated list.
    - Move `#pipewire` IRC channel to oftc.net.
    - Fix an error where param changes were not emited in all
      cases.
    - Implement Latency reporting. Latency values are propagated
      through the graph so that each node knows the latency to
      the output/input device. Synchronization in pw-stream has
      been updated to use this.
    - Some more upmix cases are added so that LFE, SIDE and REAR
      can be generated from a mono channel as well.
    - pw-stream and pw-filter will now emit the process event from
      the real-time thread in a safe way, potentially avoiding some
      of the harder to debug crashes.
    - Fix potential stack overflow with serialize_dict.
    - Add PIPEWIRE_NO_CONFIG to run without custom config files.
    - The WebRTC echo canceler was added. Next versions will
      integrate this better.
  * PulseAudio server
    - module-combine-sink was implemented.
    - Fix some segfaults when DBus connections fail.
    - Support for listening on IPv6 was added.
    - Fix a bug where many flushes could result in requests for too
      much data from the client, causing sync, latency and garbled
      sound problems after many seeks.
  * ALSA
    - Also probe input paths for multichannel mappings. This makes
      multichannel input ports show up in more cases.
    - Fix headphones/front volume issue on some cards.
    - Fix max volume issue when profile changes.
    - Fix issue with UCM local config that was not available when
      the device was opened in the server but the UCM was opened by
      the session manager. Fixes alsa 1.2.5 compatibility.
  * JACK
    - Implement latency reporting with the new Latency params.
- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(webrtc-audio-processing)
  which is required by the new WebRTC echo canceler.
- Remove patch which is already included:
  * 0001-alsa-mixer-only-use-switch-to-mute-Front-in-the-Headphone-path.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  1 07:31:49 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to use the independent switch to mute
  Lineout or Speaker instead of setting the volume, which on
  some soundcards might be shared by Headphone and Lineout or
  Headphone and Speaker (fixes boo#1186572):
  * 0001-alsa-mixer-only-use-switch-to-mute-Front-in-the-Headphone-path.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 25 07:12:32 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Introduce a workaround for systems where %systemd_user_post
  didn't enable the user services correctly due to different
  reasons . This workaround is only executed once, and only if
  it's really needed. In order to execute only once a lock file
  is created in /var/lib/pipewire. The lockfile can be removed
  when the workaround is removed.

  Everyone who upgraded their TW system between (aprox.) the 14th
  of January and the 16th of March and who didn't enable the
  services manually is affected by this. It also happens for
  everyone who installed a new TW system since (aprox.) the 14th
  of January and also for everyone doing a new installation of
  SLE15-SP3 / Leap 15.3 from the iso (new installations using
  online repositories will work fine once the fix in
  systemd-presets-common-SUSE is released).

  Fixes boo#1184852, boo#1183012 and boo#1186561.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 14:46:32 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.27
  * Highlights
    - Fix bug that caused bluetooth devices to stop working.
    - Fix session-manager crash when switching users caused by
      the DBus plugin cleanup errors.
    - Improve volume handling of monitor ports.
    - Fix GStreamer v4l2 support.
    - Implement module-remap-sink and module-remap-source in
      pipewire-pulse.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Move the loopback code into a module. Use this in pw-loopback
      and pipewire-pulse. Fix some cleanup crashes.
    - A dummy echo-cancel module was added. Later versions will
      include the webrtc echo-canceler.
    - State files don't have the X permission anymore.
    - Move i18n core into a private header file.
    - Stream can now advertize properties and receive property
      updates.
    - Fix an issue where the wrong index was used to address a port.
      It caused Bluetooth devices to stop working.
  * SPA plugins
    - Only do LFE filtering on channels we created.
    - Improve name and description of devices.
    - Improve cleanup in DBus connections and sources to avoid crash
      when destroying.
    - Improved volume handling. Hardware, Software and Monitor
      volumes are now properly separated and handled.
    - Support for S8 and S8P formats was added.
  * Tools
    - pw-cli can now also create Struct from JSON arrays.
  * Session-manager
    - The session manager can now also create passive links. This
      makes is possible to suspend effect chains together with the
      sinks when not in use.
    - Match rules now check the complete property value instead of
      only the start.
    - Handle multiple pending param enumerations, take only last
      result. This fixes some volume update issues.
  * GStreamer plugins
    - GStreamer plugins now advertize handling DMABUF explicitly. This
      is currently the only way to avoid a memcpy for v4l2 devices.
  * Device support
    - sync ACP with pulseaudio, merge upstream patch instead of our
      hack to workaround missing duplex devices.
    - V4l2 devices don't expose their fd anymore. Previously the fd
      and mmap offsets were passed to the client to access the buffer
      memory but that could create security issues.
  * Bluetooth
    - Don't unregister the profiles on shutdown because this can cause
      delay, just close the dbus connection.
    - Bluetooth devices now try to use the global samplerate from the
      graph.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Implement remap-sink and remap-source modules using the
      new loopback module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  3 03:06:31 UTC 2021 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Disable gstreamer device provider by now because the timestamp
  bug makes cheese video record abnormally longer than it should be
  (rh#1884260).
- Replace all tab characters to space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 29 11:16:51 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %systemd_ordering so systemd is installed before pipewire
  on fresh installations. This allows to set the service presets
  correctly on new systems since the %systemd_user_* macros don't
  do anything if systemd is not installed (boo#1185459).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 22 17:54:17 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Update to 0.3.26:

      ports by name so that it can be used in scripts.
    - Add module-protocol-simple that can stream raw audio on a
      socket.
    - Added i18n support. Merge PulseAudio translations for the ACP
      library so that we don't cause regressions.
    - Support more than 19 channels in the channel mixer. This
      makes all channels usable on 32 and 64 channel cards.
    - Detect if we're running in a VM and allow for tweaking some
      settings such as the max-quantum to make things work better
      in VMs.
    - Fix a potential crash when connecting a client and updating
      permissions.
    - Fix a potential crash when trying to link incompatible ports.
    - Lingering links in error will now be destroyed automatically.
  + Tools:
    - Added new pw-link tool to list and monitor ports and to list,
      monitor, create and destroy links between them.
    - pw-cli can now also list params by name.
    - pw-dump now outputs Spa:String:JSON types in metadata as
      properly parsed and formatted JSON so that tools can parse
      the metadata values using a JSON parser.
  + Session-manager:
    - Add logind support. The bluetooth monitor can only be started
      for one user at the time, so use logind detect active seats.
    - ALSA icon names were improved to match what PulseAudio does.
    - Improve the bluetooth icon name. Also use the device alias as
      the device description, like PulseAudio.
  + Device support:

  + PulseAudio server:
    - Fix module-loopback connections to monitor ports.
    - Implement module-native-protocol-tcp.
    - Handle nodes and streams with > 32 channels. The PulseAudio
      API only supports up to 32 channels so only make those 32
      first channels available with the PA API.
    - Implement module-simple-protocol-tcp.
    - Improve events emitted by the server.
    - Improvements to channels and channel_map properties on
      modules. One can imply the other and they should match when
      both given.
    - null-sink will now have their volume work correctly by
      default.
  + JACK: JACK developement files can now optionally be installed.

    - make sure midi port names are stable across reboots.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 17:43:41 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Enable or disable the ldac codec depending if ldacBT is available
  or not to fix build in s390x (where it's not available)

  changelog entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 12:02:35 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.24:
  + This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with
    previous 0.3.x releases.
  + Highlights
    - Many JACK midi improvements and device support.
    - Fixes in gnome-control-center default sink/source handling.
    - Many small performance improvements in alsa device handling
      and latency. There should also be less cracks/pops and xruns
      now.
    - More bluetooth compatibility improvements.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Implement simple upmixing
    - Disable the resampler when not used. This improves latency
      and CPU usage.
    - Handle max-quantum on devices and try to not make the quantum
      larger than the device buffer size.
    - improvements to how nodes and links are activated. It should
      now result in less xruns and cracks/pops.
    - meson uses the feature options everywhere now
    - Handle volume remap in the channelmixer. This fixes the
      channels on multichannel devices.
    - Try to escape invalid JSON string characters
    - Keep better track of changed parameters in audioconvert.
    - Improve config files, make arrays where needed.
    - Respect NO_COLOR where possible
    - Support in-place config file parsing to avoid allocations and
      improve startup performance.
    - There is no a config option to enable non-power-of-two
      quantums.
    - Preliminary support for upmixing and generating LFE channels.
  + Session-manager
    - default nodes are not stored as JSON in the metadata. This
      is more readable and introspectable.
    - More default-nodes and default-routes improvements. port
      switching should work better now.
    - Wait until all devices are scanned before linking clients.
    - Fixes some crashes
    - Sinks (monitors) can now be set as default sources.
  + Device support
    - Fix startup timers for alsa devices.
    - Improve timers in alsa when quantum changes. It should cause
      less xruns and cracks.
    - Fix UCM setup of capture devices.
    - Only disable IRQ in alsa when not batch. For batch devices
      the hw pointers are updated each IRQ so we need to keep them
      enabled. This massively improves latency on USB batch devices
      to the same level as JACK (with small enough period size).
  + Bluetooth
    - Improvements to profile switches.
    - Improvements to volume handling.
    - Fixes for A2DP sources

      in gnome-control-center.
    - Fix some races by replying to some requests after the
      operation completed.
    - Prefer formats of the extended format API.
    - Create a pid file on startup to improve compatibility with

    - Move midi ports back to the midi client
    - Only mark midi hardware ports as terminal/physical
    - Use the same midi names as a2jmidid
    - match system ports in get_ports.
    - Improve compatibility with some apps that require a
      fixed latency.
    - Beginnings of the libjackserver implementation.
- Switch off libopenaptx and fdk-aac (because they are
  patent-encumbered) and libcamera (problems in building).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 17 17:15:02 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- systemd-rpm-macros doesn't have a consistent versioning between
  distributions, so better assume it's updated enough to support
  %systemd_user_pre

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 16 11:21:02 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add systemd rpm macros for pipewire.service as well as
  pipewire.socket .
- Use the new %systemd_user_pre macro on %pre to be able to
  recognize when a service was installed for the first time and
  enable it on %systemd_user_post (boo#1183012)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  9 16:46:52 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.23:
  + Highlights
    - Fixes for some critical bugs in last release.
    - Fix bug where audio was not drained properly at the end of
      playback, causing repeating sound.
    - Profile and route switching was improved and should mimic
      more what pulseaudio did.
    - Various fixes for xruns in capture and playback.
    - Bluetooth now supports delay adjustment and various other
      improvements.
    - The pulseaudio server now correctly identifies AC3 and DTS
      streams and returns a not supported error instead of playing
      static.
    - Multichannel support was improved in the alsa plugin and
      the channel mixer. Channels should now play on the right
      speakers in all cases.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Small fixes and improvements in JSON parsing and encoding.
    - Improvements to param handling in audioconverter. It would
      previously not always notify of changes.
    - Avoid updating some properties that we use internally such
      as the object id and the node.id.
    - log.level in the config files is now actually used.
    - the PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variable should always override
      any application settings in filter/stream/jack.
    - The config file can now contain filer and stream properties
      to, for example, control the resampler, mixer and latency.
    - Add sandboxing to the systemd services
    - Various FreeBSD fixes.
    - Improve draining and a way to exit the drain state as well.
    - Many multichannel fixes. Channel remapping should now be
      correct.
    - Fix bug with repeating audio at the end of playback because
      the drain in the resampler was not draining all channels.
    - RTKit default rt.prio has been increased to 88. This will
      likely still be clamped to 20 until distros increase the
      max priority.
  + Session-manager
    - Don't try to switch to Pro Audio profile, this should be
      a user choice only.
    - Don't crash when metadata was disabled such as when not
      using the audio features of pipewire.
    - Rework the profile and route handling.
    - Add systemd unit files for the media-session
    - Device names should now also have sane names so that tab
      pactl completion works on them.
  + Device support
    - Fix ALSA format enumeration in more cases. Use the channels
      and rate as a filter.
    - Make sure the graph doesn't ever use buffers larger than
      the alsa device buffer size or we get xruns.
    - Tuning of the alsa device timeout handling and dynamic
      resampler. There should now not be any xruns when streams
      appear and disappear or when the quantum changes.
    - Fix bug in alsa device when reassigning to a new driver,
      in some cases the dynamic resampler was not activated and
      things would drift out of sync and fail.
    - Fixes in quantum changes for ALSA capture and how the
      resampler is drained and fed with the new samples.
  + Bluetooth
    - Delay adjustment has been implemented now. Bluetooth
      devices should now be more synchronized with video due
      to proper delay reporting. Because BT delays can be
      large, it can cause hickups in some players.
    - Fix volume in bluetooth devices.
    - Codec switch improvements.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Latency offset adjustment is now implemented and functional
      for bluetooth devices. It is not working for alsa devices
      yet.
    - Handle unsupported formats. Previously we would accept encoded
      formats and play noise. This fixes AC3 playback in vlc.
    - Move some of the configurable parameters to the config file.
    - Fix a fatal use after free when playing samples
    - Improve module handling. loaded modules now show up in the
      list of modules and can be unloaded. This also prepares the
      core for more module implementations later.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Fix drain with very large buffers, we need to manually start
      the stream before draining.
    - Fix the channel layout handling.
    - Improve compatibility with apps that expect the poll to only
      return when there is activity.
    - Fix drain for capture
  + JACK
    - Add a config option to shorten and filter client names
    - Increase the length of the client name size and make sure
      we don't exceed the allocated size.
    - We now include our own jack header files so we can build
      without depending on another jack-devel package. We don't
      yet install the headers or provide pkgconfig files.
- Move alsa-card-profiles to modules subpackage, they are always
  needed.

Thu Mar  4 15:39:47 UTC 2021 - Niklas Haas <obs@haasn.xyz>

- Build/install the `pw-top` tool:
  + Add pkgconfig(ncurses) BuildRequires to satisfy the build deps
    of pw-top.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 11:10:46 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Do not provide pulseaudio, but pulseaudio-daemon so we can
  specify in the patterns that we prefer the pulseaudio package
  (boo#1182730)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 07:32:58 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.22:
  + Highlights
    - Per client config files replace the module-profiles. It's
      now possible to tweak settings and load custom modules.
    - Pro Audio card profile support. You can now select the
      Pro Audio profile and have raw device access with the
      maximum number of channels and no mixer controls. This is
      the usual setup for managing high end Pro Audio cards.
    - Many fixes and improvements in the JACK library to make
      devices look and integrate better.
    - Many bluetooth improvements. Playback should be more
      reliable and better synchronized. Support for the HFP HF
      profile.
    - Small fixes and improvements all over the map.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Add support for restrictions requested by a client. This
      makes it possible to implement Flatpak policy for emulated
      PulseAudio clients as well.
    - Fix removal of params in objects. Previously they would not
      be removed from the cache.
    - Remove mlock warnings by default. There is an option to
      enable them again if you want to check if your system is
      optimized.
    - Remove LimitMEMLOCK lines from the service files. They can
      only lower the system settings and are thus not useful.
    - Implement per-client config files. Each pipewire client will
      now read a config file that you can use to configure the
      context of the client.
    - Implement state and config load/save in pipewire. This is
      used by the session manager or other apps.
    - Make an option to disable dbus support.
    - Add tool to convert pipewire config to JSON.
  + Session-manager
    - Give all permissions to Manager flatpak apps. In the future
      we will use the Permission store to remember user settings.
    - Improvements to default audio/sink handling.
    - Add option to configure device suspend time.
    - Small fixes in route handling.
  + Device support
    - Complain when ACP profile files are not found and use
      a fallback in order to get something working.
    - Add volume support to monitor ports.
    - Fix resume from suspend for ALSA in more cases.
    - ALSA ACP cards now have a Pro Audio profile that exposes
      the raw card devices.
  + Bluetooth
    - Enable A2DP delay reporting. This improves audio/video sync
      when playing audio over bluetooth.
    - Fix stuttering in A2DP source
    - Tweak buffer size and latency settings to avoid stuttering
    - More work on HSP and HFP support
    - Fix initial profile configuration
    - Add HFP HF support
  + PulseAudio server
    - Small tweaks in capture packet size to avoid crashes in some
      apps.
    - Detect Flatpak apps and requests the flatpak permissions from
      the session manager. This means that Flatpak pulseaudio apps
      will now run with reduced permissions.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Reduce min buffer size in the plugin for lower possible
      latency.
  + JACK
    - implement some missing methods to make qjackctl work again.
    - Use the context data thread instead of making our own. This
      fixes the issue where the data thread was not given RT
      priority correctly.
    - Pass extra jack flags around in port properties. This makes
      CV ports in carla work.
    - Many tweaks to the port names and aliases. Unwanted
      characters are filtered out, giving better names to jack
      apps. Default device names are now equal to those seen in
      pulseaudio apps.
    - Add an option to make a separate client for the monitor
      ports of a device. This makes it more usable in apps.
    - add support for system:playback_N and system:capture_N port
      names for apps that hardcode these port names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 24 11:29:58 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Re-add the Provides: pulseaudio; patterns-base now suggests
  pulseaudio, which should help zypp in doing a smarter decision
  (boo#1182730).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 09:30:54 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- ldacBT only builds on little endian architectures, so we can't
  buildrequire it on big endian systems like s390, s390x or ppc64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 17:02:06 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dleuenberger@suse.com>

- Remove the pulseaudio provides from pipewire-pulseaudio:
  We first need to ensure our KDE patterns (and others) become
  smart enough to favor pulseaudio until we are ready for the
  switch (boo#1182730).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 17:02:31 UTC 2021 - Dominik Schmidt <dev@dominik-schmidt.de>

- Update to version 0.3.21:
  + Highlights
    - Many PulseAudio compatibility fixes. Handling of corked
      streams, the prebuf setting, seek modes and stream flags
      are now implemented correctly.
    - Ports and Profiles are now managed by the session manager
      and can save and restore previous settings.
      ALSA device handling has been tweaked for maximum
      compatibility at the expense of latency. There are tuning
      options in the config file.
    - Improved Bluetooth support. HSP is disabled by default
      because it is old and deprecated and in some cases causes
      conflicts with the newer HFP profile. Codec switching is
      now implemented as well.
      PipeWire accepts donations with liberapay now.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Improve draining in pw-stream.
      pw-stream now uses busy metadata by default. This makes sure
      that no writer can write to buffers when readers are still
      busy.
    - Fix handling of empty array/choice instead of failing.
    - Fix crashes when creating properties from empty strings.
    - Make it possible to pass an array to module-access
      access.allowed variables
    - Fix small bug in argument parsing in pw-cat
  + Session-manager
    - Restore route volumes in all cases, also when switching
      routes.
    - Use a default route volume for unknown routes instead of
      letting the system decide on a default.
      Improve profile handling. Don't try to restore unavailable
      profiles. Implement the profile switching in the session
      manager now.
    - Fix handling of Virtual sources as defaults.
    - Handle port switching in the session manager. Implement
      save and restore of default ports per profile.
  + GStreamer
    - Fix a crash with zero SPA_PARAM_BUFFERS_size
  + Device support
    - v4l2-source will now respect the requested memory types.
    - ALSA buffering has been tweaked. USB devices should have
      less XRuns by default. Parameters can be tweaked to
      decrease the latency on capable devices. Also fix a case
      where a quantum change would cause an xrun.
    - Fix mute in bluetooth devices
      bluetooth devices are not paused in idle anymore for
      improved compatibility.
    - Codec switching for bluetooth is implemented along with
      config options to select the codecs manually.
    - HSP for bluetooth is now disabled by default. Most devices
      support the newer HFP profile and some devices fail when
      both are available.
    - Reduce the amount of events the ALSA plugins emit by bundling
      them.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Implement the suspend command
    - Fixes volume in sample info
    - Fix playback of samples, sometimes samples would be clipped
      short. Also implement the target sink for the sample.
    - Use rate match to feed samples. This way the latency can
      be kept to a minimum.
    - Latency has been tuned some more, more closely emulating
      pulseaudio behaviour.
    - Improve default sink/source handling. Make sure all events
      are sent correctly when defaults change.
    - Handle underrun better without causing sync issues. Make sure
      to pause in corked state.
    - Implement rewind due to seeks, fixes GStreamer seeking.
- Do not remove alsa-card-profiles, they are required

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 15:32:37 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Provide pulseaudio by pipewire-pulseaudio: there are various
  packages in the distro that require pulseaudio, but essentially,
  they should be happy with pipewire-pulseaudio as a replacement.
  Do not provide the symbol though, as we do not (yet) want to
  automatically migrate users over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 12:12:43 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add pkgconfig(ldacBT-abr) and pkgconfig(ldacBT-enc)
  BuildRequires: Build bluetooth ldac codec support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 15:50:31 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.20:
  + Highlights
    - Latency was reduced in ALSA and PulseAudio and time
      reporting has improved a lot.
    - Bluetooth now has a native HFP backed, SBC XQ and
      mSBC support.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements, improved device
      support.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - pw-dump can now dump all objects such as Endpoints
    - pw-dump has a -m option to monitor changes
    - pw-dump can now dump metadata
    - pw-stream can now use the rate-match io to exactly
      produce the required number of samples for the
      current cycle. When using this feature, a stream can
      achieve the same low-latency as pw-filter.
    - spa-acp-tool can now load a custom profile-set and
      correctly parses the volume updates
    - There is now a nofail option when loading modules
    - The connection has been made reentrant to fix some
      strange random problems with metadata.
    - Turn some errors into warnings or simply info.
    - Executables are now built with PIE

    - Remove mlock warnings. Add support for mlockall with
      a config option.
  + Session-manager
    - There are now config files for bluez and v4l2 modules
    - Improve ALSA device and node properties
    - Bluetooth devices have better properties now.
    - The default device routing has been improved.
  + Device support
    - Port priorities are updated for UCM devices
    - ACP devices notify change in routes in all cases
    - There is now RW support in ALSA devices to increase
      compatibility.
    - Many improvements to Bluetooth. SBC XQ support can now
      be enabled with a config option. mSBC can be enabled
      with an option.
    - Bluetooth devices not expose Routes so that they look
      more like how PulseAudio handles them
    - Gracefully handle missing profile-sets
    - There is now a native HFP backend
    - Improve card names in some cases.
    - pause-on-idle is now disabled for ALSA devices. This can
      reduce pops and clicks when the device is stopped.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Use rate-match to reduce the latency
    - Implement a _delay() function to get smoother timestamps.
    - Fix property parsing. Fixes volume changes in alsamixer.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Use rate-match to reduce the latency. This also reduces
      the buffering in audioconvert and improves timestamp
      reporting.
    - Implement rate changes now that we have rate-match
      support.
    - pactl stats will now work
    - Fix excessive memory usage when a capture client doesn't
      read fast enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 09:07:19 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.19:
  + Highlights
    - Startup after login should be fixed now with inotify
      used to wait for permissions.
    - Channels should be mapped correctly now.
    - Many bluetooth improvements in LDAC, AptX-HD. AAC was
      also added. Headsets should work better now.
    - pipewire-libpulse was removed. It is now completely
      replaced by pipewire-pulse.
    - Fix a crasher bug in pipewire-pulse and some memory leaks.
    - Fix a bug with feedback loop that would cause 100% CPU.
    - A new pw-top tool to display real-time graph performance.
    - The example session manager now has config files.
    - The config file format was changed to use the SPA JSON
      tokenizer. This makes it more flexible and extensible.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Fix debug of id in format channels
    - Audioconvert should now remap channels correctly in all
      cases.
    - Feedback loops were not scheduled correctly and would
      cause 100% CPU usage.
    - Small improvements to the profiler to also log incomplete
      graph status.
    - a new tool pw-top was added that prints real-time performance
      stats of the graph.
    - the rtkit module now sets the nice level to -11
  + Session-manager
    - The session manager would sometimes link dont-reconnect
      nodes to another node, which would leak monitor streams in
     pipewire-pulse.
    - The session manager now has configuration files. Config files
      can also be placed in the user home directory to make custom
      configurations.
    - The session managers now creates unique device and node
      names for alsa and v4l2 devices.
  + Device support
    - Many improvements in Bluetooth codecs, LDAC stuttering,
      AptX-HD negotiation, LDAC ABR support
    - Bluetooth supports AAC audio now.
    - Many fixes to Bluetooth SCO transport used in headsets.
    - inotify support in device monitors
    - ACP was synced with the latest pulseaudio code
    - Fix a bug in enumeration of device ports.
  - PulseAudio server
    - seek flags and offset are now supported, making gstreamer
      pulse elements work better.
    - Fix a crasher bug in pipewire-pulse, we sometimes would
      write too much to the ringbuffer
    - Fix some memory leaks in error cases.
    - Fix handling of NULL string to locate default sink/source
  + JACK layer
    - Ports can also be found with the aliases now, making
      qjackctl work in more cases.
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.18:
  + Highlights
    - More work in the PulseAudio server. It should be compatible
      with more applications.
    - Bluetooth now support extra codecs such as AptX/HD and LDAC.
    - Support for virtual sources and sink was improved a lot.
    - Added a new pw-dump tool to dump the objects in JSON formats
      and for filtering them with tools like jq.
    - Many more stability fixes and improvements.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Silence some harmless warnings
    - pw-cli can now be used to set parameters.
    - Streams now perform the correct channel mapping when linked
      to non-standard multichannel devices. Previously channels
      would get swapped.
    - port, node and device params are now cached in the server.
      This avoids opening and closing devices whenever some client
      enumerates formats, which improves performance a lot,
      especially in cases where opening a device is slow.
    - Add a command to keep a device open during negotiation. This
      is used to enumerate and set a format while opening the
      device just once, improving performance.
    - The null-sink scheduling was fixed.
    - A memory corruption bug was fixed in format conversion, this
      could cause crashes, silent channels or other undefined
      behaviour.
    - There is now a simple JSON parser.
  + Session-manager
    - Settings files are now stored in JSON. With the json parser
      this is easier to parse and extend
  + Device support
    - Bluetooth now supports additional codecs: LDAC, AptX and
      AptX HD. LDAC is known to not work very well yet.
    - ALSA devices will now default to the max supported channels
      if nothing else is specified. This makes it possible to use
      8+ channel cards with the alsa-pcm module, which is not
      supported with the default alsa-acp module.
    - Enable mSBC support in oFono.
    - Add an option to disable hardware mixers
    - ALSA now improves support for batch devices.
    - The udev rules had references to Pulseaudio removed in order
      to not create conflicts.
    - Fix a potential crash in bluetooth devices when
      disconnecting.
    - UCM cards now use HW volume when possible.
  + PulseAudio server
    - The id can now be used as the name to locate cards and
      devices
    - Report streams with planar formats as well
    - Better error reporting when stream create fails
    - module-null-sink can now handle channels, rate and
      channel_map properties
    - Add support for 3 types of virtual devices: source,
      sink and duplex.
    - set-port was fixed
    - Some buffer parameters were tweaked to improve
      performance, compatibility and stuttering with lower
      latency.
    - NULL can be used as a name for the device sink/source
    - Support lookup of monitor names
    - Set properties more like pulseaudio so that some
      clients (Teamspeak) don't crash anymore
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.17:
  + Highlights
    - Fix crasher bug for kwin when screensharing stopped.
    - Massive improvements and compatibility fixes in the
      PulseAudio server.
    - The session manager now has a config directory in
      /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ It will look for files there
      to activate session manager modules. Packagers can use
      this to only activate the audio modules when the PulseAudio
      server, libjack.so or the alsa modules are installed.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - We now clear hooks before adding them. Some application
      did not clear them and had random data for the destroy
      callback.
    - Return -ENOENT from unknown resources so apps can handle
      this better. It's a common problem when an app tries to
      introspect and object but it disappeared before the message
      reached the server. Apps should ignore this.
    - channelmap information is now passed with the volume
    settings.
    - DMABuf is not mmapp()ed anymore with the FLAG_MAP_BUFFERS in
      the stream or filter. This is because DMABuf usually
      requires more that just a simple mmap and is better left
      for the application.
    - increase the maximum number of ports for a client-node.
    - adapter and node-factory now support the linger option to
      keep the objects alive after the creating client disconnected.
  + Device support
    - ALSA now handles error in close(), like when unplugging a
      USB device.
  + Session-manager
    - The session manager is now handling DONT_RECONNECT streams
      without a target node. They get connected to a default node
      once and then fail to reconnect.
    - The session manager now exposes the stream setting as
      metadata. This makes it possible for other components, such
      as pulse-server to use this information. Information is stored
      as a json object for easier consumption.
    - The session manager now has a config directory in
      /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ packagers can use this
  + PulseAudio server
    - Pulse server now acquire the dbus name.
    - Improvements in timing and compatibility with many apps.
    - The stream-restore extension is now implemented so that
      the event volume can be configured.
    - Many stability fixes and improvements.
    - Fix some issues with module-load/unload
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.16:
  + Highlights
    - Fix screensharing for old 0.2 clients
    - Many pulse-server improvements. There is now a
      pipewire-pulse binary that is the prefered solution for
      PulseAudio compatibility. The replacement libpulse
      libraries are now deprecated. This also makes audio in
      Flatpak work.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Fix cleanup of listeners everywhere. Force remove of
      listeners in _destroy to avoid crashes.
    - Add support for a journald logger module.
    - Various memory leak fixes
    - Silence some warnings that spammed the logs.
    - Fix flush in pw_stream. This fixes small glitches when
      switching streams in music players.
    - Various FreeBSD fixes and improvements.
    - Fix some crashes when destroying objects.
  + Device support
    - Reload the ALSA configuration when creating a node so that
      hotplugged devices work in all cases.
    - Fix memory leaks in ACP library. This also fixes issues
      where the mixer device was not closed.
    - Bluetooth now has support for the mSBC codec for SCO
      source and sink.
  + pulse-server
    - Many introspection and compatibility improvements. It should
      now be as good or better than the replacement library.
    - Implement sample cache to make notification events work.
  + JACK layer
    - handle errors when linking, fixes jack_connect hang when
      the ports were already linked.
- Drop patches do-not-use-snd_pcm_ioplug_hw_avail.patch and
  fix-memfd_create-call.patch, no longer needed on SLE/Leap which
  have updated glibc / alsa.
- Drop do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch, remove files at
  install time instead.
- pw-pulse wrapper is gone, remove all mentions of it.
- Package pulseaudio replacement in a subpackage and drop
  pipewire-libpulse-0_3 (pipewire will use pulseaudio libraries
  directly).
- Create an alsa subpackage and move alsa pipewire plugin to this
  subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 10:37:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.15:
  + Highlights
    - This is a quick update to fix critical issues with the
      0.3.14 update, which broke screen sharing and accidentally
      enabled the experimental pulse-server.
    - Fix some compatibility issues in pulse-server with
      pavucontrol and fix an issue that would block the complete
      server.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Permission checks for new clients are now done from a
      global context, which makes it possible to assign initial
      permissions to objects.
    - Handle EINTR everywhere
    - Fix an issue with the node state changes where a quick
      pause/play would hang a client.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Disable the bluez5 and pulse-bridge modules by default
      because they interfere with pulseaudio. These options should
      only be enabled if pulseaudio is removed or disabled in the
      system.
    - Fix an issue where the session manager could end up in
      infinite recursion while scanning for things to do.
    - The session manager will now always configure nodes to remix
      to the channel configuration of the device. This fixes the
      case where mono streams would only end up on one channel of a
      stereo device.
  + Device support
    - Initial merge of A2DP extra codec support using the new
      bluez5 API.
  + pulse-server
    - Create the runtime directory when it doesn't exist.
    - Don't ever block the server, use non-blocking IO everywhere.
    - Fill description of profiles with the name if not otherwise
      set, this fixes a crash in pavucontrol.
    - the connection debug catergory will now also debug pulse
      messages.
    - Respect the no_remix flag to make the control panel channel
      check work.
  + ALSA plugin
    - implement pause

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 08:11:46 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.14:
  + Highlights
    - This release focuses on bugfixes and stability
      improvements.
    - A new experimental pulse-server module was added. This
      module implements the pulseaudio protocol on top of
      PipeWire and can be used to make flatpaks work with
      PipeWire. It looks like this might be a better way
      forward compared to the libpulse.so replacement library.
    - A2DP bluetooth was reworked. Playback should work a lot
      better now. Support was also added to automatically link
      an A2DP source to a playback device, which makes it possible
      to use PipeWire as a bluetooth receiver as well.
    - Improvements to the routing and volume restore features
      of the session manager.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - The channelmixer does not normalize volumes anymore. Volumes
      are only normalized for monitoring streams now.
    - Streams can actually start in the inactive state now.
    - The channelmixer can now also convert volume updates from one
      channel layout to another. This makes saved volumes work
      even when streams have different channel layouts.
    - Clients are only registered after the properties have been
      updated.
    - Links now have a new active state.
    - Drivers can now also specify a minimum quantum. This makes it
      possible for bluetooth devices to specify an optimum quantum
      for the given codec settings and MTU.
    - The amount of data sent over the socket was reduced by only
      sending the data that changed.
    - Client objects are now exposed after they uploaded their
      properties, which makes the new object more useful.
  + Tools improvements
    - pw-cat will now add metadata to the PipeWire streams.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Fix crashes when reading bad data in stored settings.
    - volume and routing is improved. Settings are now remembered
      per application or media-role.
    - The session manager remembers the last device used per stream
    - Fix a bug when moving streams where it could sometimes end
      up with linking a stream to multiple devices.
    - Use RTKit to set realtime priority on the data thread in the
      session manager. This improves performance of the pulse-server
      and bluetooth devices.
    - Add a new property to mark streams that want to capture from
      the monitor of the default sink.
    - NODE_TARGET can now also contain the node name. This avoids
      some lookups in the pulseaudio layer when selecting target
      nodes by name.
    - the -e and -d options are more usable now and can be used to
      add and remove modules from the default list of modules.
  + Device support
    - v4l2: add some workarounds for buggy drivers. Add Limited
      support for droidcam.
    - ACP: improve selection of default port and profiles.
    - ACP: add support for using the hardware mixer for more than
      8 channel streams.
    - ACP: support the new port type and availability group found
      in PulseAudio.
    - A2DP bluetooth timings were reworked. Automatic linking of
      A2DP sources was added to make it possible for PipeWire to
      act as a bluetooth receiver. The code was reworked to allow
      other codecs such as APTX and LDAC in the future.
    - Try harder to recover from ALSA errors.
  + GStreamer improvements
    - Fix some crashes in the monitor that cause
      gnome-initial-setup to crash.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Many compatibility improvements. Improved playback in
      chrome. Fix a crash in firefox when the daemon is stopped.
    - Fix a leak in the formats.
    - Fix !ADJUST_LATENCY streams like paplay.
    - Make the device option in paplay work.
    - Fix volume/mute notifications, this makes plasma volume updates
      work again.
    - Do the conversion between PulseAudio cubic volumes and PipeWire
      linear volumes. Volume levels should behave now like they did
      with PulseAudio.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - Return an error when we run out of midi events. Some application
      rely on this behaviour.
  + ALSA plugin improvements
    - The ALSA plugin now also supports the node name in the
      playback_node and capture_node properties.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 27 17:32:57 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Rename 99-pipewire-default.conf to
  99-pipewire-default.conf.example so it's disabled by default and
  all ALSA I/O doesn't get redirected to pipewire (which was only
  overrided by pulseaudio's configuration in alsa-plugins-pulse
  casually). Thanks to Takashi Iwai for noticing (boo#1178104,
  boo#1177166 and probably boo#1175584)
- Add baselibs.conf (boo#1177555)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 08:29:36 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.13:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Add pw-reserve tool to reserve or monitor a device on DBus.
    - Install spa-resample, a tool to resample a file.
    - Install spa-acp-tool, a tool to inspect the card profile.
    - Various fixes and improvements
    - Fix a bug in pw-stream where a capture stream could run out
      of buffers and become silent.
    - Rework the processing loops in the adapter and stream. There
      is now less latency in PulseAudio and ALSA layers.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Improve the device reservation code. We now try to acquire
      the device using the dbus device reservation API before we
      probe the device. This avoids conflicts with a running
      PulseAudio where devices would disappear (because they were
      locked by the other process).
    - Don't fail on invalid input from the config files.
    - Audio devices now have the same name as what PulseAudio
      would assign.
  + Device support
    - v4l2: try to use the format before enumerating the size and
      framerate. Some drivers don't check the format and might now
      work better.
    - v4l2: Fall back to MMAP when EXPBUF fails. Fix MMAP access,
      just export the fd and the mapoffset. This should make more
      devices work.
    - Fix crash in ALSA Card Profile (ACP) code.
    - ACP: fix selection of default profile. Prefer any possibly
      available profile over 'Off'. This makes some card at least
      start with something.
    - Fix soft volume. After setting the volume to 0, it would stay
      at 0 until pushed over the max volume. This should fix
      various volume related issues.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Rework the buffering and latency measurements and tweak the
      buffer attributes. This should make browsers and media
      players work better. This should also improve speechd
      performance.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - Fix compilation against newer JACK.

- Rebase patch:
  + do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 12:37:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.12:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - The channelmap converter now handles unknown and strange
      channel layouts much better.
    - The resampler is now cleared correctly, avoiding clicks and
      pops at the start of sound.
    - Fixes for various crasher bugs. (paplay drain, vlc shutdown,
      pactl info, ...)
    - Fix a race condition in the node state changes that caused
      all kinds of sync and other issues (vlc, mpv, ...)
    - Improve the binary name property of applications
    - Fix the scheduling again of nodes that always need a driver
      such as the jack clients.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Fix routing to default nodes. Sometimes nodes were not routed
      to the default node (bluetooth)
  + Device support
    - Disable channelmap from ALSA by default. This is what
      PulseAudio does and thus provides better compatibility.
    - Fix a bug in how the resampler was used in the ALSA source,
      causing distortion and errors when using low latency capture
      clients. (Discord, webrtc, ...)
    - Small bluetooth improvements. More work is needed for
      reliable bluetooth playback.
  + GStreamer plugins
    - The device provider now stops the processing loop before
      shutting down, which avoids crashes (gnome-initial-setup).
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - The buffer attributes were reworked to ensure compatibility
      with many more applications such as mpv and audacious.
    - The pulseaudio layer will now try hard to not hand out
      invalid channel maps to the application. (avoids crashes in
      gnome-volume-control). The channel map will now also look
      more like what PulseAudio does.
    - The @DEFAULT_SINK/SOURCE/MONITOR@ wildcards now work. This
      fixes the problem with volume keys when they are bound to
      scripts using pactl and the default sink/source wildcards.
    - The PIPEWIRE_LATENCY environment variable now works again
    - Fix some leaks of ports and port info. Also fix the leak of
      the context when the mainloop is stopped.
    - The sink/source format_info array is now filled up
      completely, this is actually not implemented yet in the real
      PulseAudio.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - jack now returns version 3.0.0 and has PipeWire in the
      version string so that apps can report this.
- Drop patch:
  + 0001-alsa-dont-change-the-resampler-delay-value.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 05:32:09 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.11:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Properly cleanup the mixer structures when a port is removed,
      this should fix client crashes related to port config changes
      and other random crashes.
    - Optimize the preferred formats in the audio converter. Higher
      quality formats with higher performance are chosen first.
    - Make sure the time reported by pw_stream is always
      increasing, even when the driver and clock changes.
    - There is now also a system service and socket that can be
      used to enable PipeWire systemwide. This is however not
      recommended and disabled by default.
    - Fix channelmixer 5.1 to stereo mix matrix. It was not reading
      the conversion matrix correctly and cause channels to be
      dropped. The channelmixer will now also normalize the volume,
      like what pulseaudio does.
    - The channelmixer will now just copy channels when no layout
      has been given. It has also optimized paths for this. This
      makes it possible for apps to request > 8 channels from the
      alsa plugin (ardour).
    - Port, Node and Link will now also emit an error on the
      resources in addition to updating the error in the info. This
      would make it easier to track negotiation errors in the
      session manager later.
    - many small fixes and cleanups.
    - Fix compatibility:
      - DOSBox: fix crash because of double free in pw_stream
  + Session manager improvements
    - The session manager will now try to configure the client to
      the channel configuration of the sink/source. It will only
      do this for downmixing, never for upmixing and also never
      when the client has the dont-remix property set. It will
      also renegotiate the channel layout when moving a stream to
      a new sink/source.
    - Configuration state is now saved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
      Previously it was saved in $HOME/.pipewire-media-session/
      You can migrate the state by moving the files to
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire-media-session (or
      $HOME/.config/pipewire-media-session as a fallback when
      XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).
  + Device support
    - Bluetooth sources and sinks should work better now.
    - There is now also a new bluetooth backend using hsphfpd.
    - fix the ALSA UCM Off profile for alsa pcm devices
    - improve ALSA port and profile switching. The ACP device will
      now switch to the best port and profile when availability
      changes.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Implement some more callbacks. The pulse layer will now also
      notify applications of stream moved, started and latency
      changes.
    - Fix error code when an object was not found. We now return
      PA_ERR_NOENTITY instead of PA_ERR_INVALID.
    - Add some support for loading new null sinks. Applications
      such as pulseeffects use this. Note that pulseeffects does
      not yet work reliably but can start now.
    - Improve handling of profile and port updates, it should work
      much more reliable now. Apps should now also again receive
      volume updates from sinks/sources.
    - Fix compatibility:
  	- openal-soft 1.20
  	- pavucontrol (checks PA_ERR_NOENTITY)
  + JACK layer improvements
    - improve default source and sink handling. It was not updated
      correctly in all cases.
    - add samplerate and period to the pw-jack wrapper to easily
      configure the desired samplerate and perdiod for the app.
  + ALSA plugin improvements
    - Add a mixer entry in the alsa config file.
    - Implement support for planar types, rework the processing
      function to make it more robust.
    - refuse to load the alsa plugin when linked against 0.2. This
      catches some old apps linked against 0.2 that want to use the
      alsa plugin.
    - Fix compatibility:
      - linphone (ALSA SIGFPE when _status() is called
        before _prepare()).
- Includes fix for a division by 0 error (boo#1176515):
  + 0021-alsa-protect-against-SIGPFE.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix audio stutters in discord and probably
  other applications when using alsa directly.
  + 0001-alsa-dont-change-the-resampler-delay-value.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 27 06:00:06 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.10:
  + Many improvements to the pulse layer.
    - GStreamer pulsesink element now works.
    - Fixes some segfaults.
    - Enable rtkit for client threads.
    - fixes capture of monitor stream by name
    - implement some more extensions, this makes paman
      work and removes some warnings.
  + Many improvements to the GStreamer elements
    - negotiation rework, avoid calling GStreamer methods from
      the PipeWire callbacks because they might block and cause
      deadlocks.
    - Add support for non-string property values.
    - improve stability after buffer and format
      renegotiation.
    - Rework the device provider.
    - pipewiresink can now provide a stream that can
      be consumed by apps like cheese.
  + Many improvements to the JACK layer:
    - Rework the buffer_size callbacks. Make sure we call
      the callback from a 'safe' thread and that we don't
      call the process callback while the application is
      handling the callback. This improves stability in
      apps like Carla when PipeWire dynamically changes
      the buffer size.
    - Improve compatibility with apps that call
      get_buffer_frames() with a 0 size (calfjackrack)
    - JACK can now create nodes that can be set as a
      sink/source in PulseAudio/ALSA apps (you can make an
      effects rack and set that as default sink for
      apps).
  + Added a group id property for nodes. This makes it
    possible to schedule nodes with the same driver even
    when they are otherwise not linked together. To make
    this work well a new flag needed to be added to nodes
    to signal when they are ready for processing.
    Together with the GStreamer fixes, this makes things
    like:
     gst-launch-1.0 -v pipewiresrc path=51 stream-properties="props,node.group=1" !
           audio/x-raw ! pipewiresink stream-properties="props,node.group=1"
    work as expected with PipeWire managing the resampling
    to keep the clocks of the devices in sync.
    This can later also be used to force devices to be grouped
    together to create a JACK-like scheduling group.
  + Streams and filter now use PIPEWIRE_NODE and
    PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variables as fallback.
  + ACP add per device port list. This makes UCM devices
    expose the right ports.
  + Fix some segfaults in ACP and UCM.
  + make pw-cat use the metadata to find default devices.
  + The media session can now save and load audio device
    Profiles and Routes (volumes), stream volumes and
    the default sink and sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 13 11:28:16 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.9:
  + Fix bad audio in chrome
  + Remove some errors that are not real errors.
  + Fix 100% cpu when disconnecting devices.
  + Improve pulseaudio introspection of formats
  + Fix JACK metadata handling, carla can now monitor the
    port it creates and insert midi.
  + Add a new permission bit (M) that is needed to be able
    to configure metadata on an object. Improve security of
    metadata some more, only allow metadata on objects that
    are visible to the client setting the metadata.
  + Add support for videocrop in the GStreamer elements.
  + Improve handling of the runtime directory for the
    server sockets. Add some reasonable fallback when
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set, as suggested in the spec.
  + Improve ALSA device names from ACP.
  + Fix various crasher bugs. One in the pulse layer, one in
    the session manager.
  + Make alsa plugin respect the PIPEWIRE_REMOTE env variable.
  + Various compile fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 07:50:45 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.8:
  + Fix an embarrassing crasher in the JACK layer when metadata
    keys were removed.
  + Make it possible to add properties to jack clients with a
    PIPEWIRE_PROPS env variable. This can be used to make JACK
    nodes look like a device (like an effects rack).
  + Improvements in the session manager in how it links ports.
    Now it will try to link matching channels first and be more
    intelligent otherwise. The session manager will also configure
    the stream to the device port configuration when needed.
  + Add ofono backend for Bluetooth HeadSet support.
  + Improve default source and sink handling. They are now stored
    with their id, instead of name, in the metadata. This makes it
    work better with JACK because of JACK's limited name length.
  + Improve environment variables to make it possible to create
    and connect to servers other than "pipewire-0". Implement
    this in pulseaudio, JACK and alsa layers.
  + Add an alsa mixer plugin so that alsamixer works with PipeWire.
    It will configure the default source/sink volumes.
  + Fix capture devices. There was something wrong with how the
    resampler was used that caused corruption in the signal when
    the resampler was active.
  + We now ship alsa card paths, profile-sets configuration files
    and udev rules so that we don't have to rely on the pulseaudio
    ones.
  + Many build and stability fixes.

- Update to version 0.3.7:
  + Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
    code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
    all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
    mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
    be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
    in how it presents and manages devices.
    Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
    and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
    it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
    compatibility layer for those who want to try.
  + Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
    pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
    the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
    screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
    still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
    elements can now also share a connection between them.
  + Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
    and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
    fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.
  + Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
    where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
    memory.
  + Support for passive links is added again. These are links
    that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
    This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
    to suspend as a group when not in use.
  + Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
    the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
    to how links and node states were handled. More work is
    needed to implement more use cases.
  + Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
    was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
    in reuse of the wrong memory.
  + Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.
  + Improved error handling in the session manager.
  + Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
    sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
    to the default device. Changing the default device will
    move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
    respect the default source/sinks.
  + Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
    a stream and the session manager will move streams when
    the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
    implement the move_stream feature.
  + Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
    has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
    apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
    objects. Security related properties are made read-only
    now. Different access modules can now coexist.
  + The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
    - a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
    - a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.

  modified in every package update:
  + fix-meson-required-version.patch
- Add patch to not install alsa card paths, profile-sets
  configuration files and udev rules which upstream installs
  "so that we don't have to rely on the pulseaudio ones".
  + do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 15 07:26:01 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Recommend pipewire from libpipewire, so if the library is
  installed the daemon gets pulled in since we want a daemon
  to connect to.
- Require pipewire-spa-plugins from pipewire instead of
  recommending it since the support plugin is actually required
  for most uses (like screen sharing in wayland, which we want to
  support out-of-the-box).
- Enable the pipewire.socket systemd user service in %post
  (using pulseaudio's %post section as an example of how to do it
  since systemd-presets-common-SUSE currently lacks support for
  user services). Also disable it in %preun and %postun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 08:25:49 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

  + fix-memfd_create-call.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 16 09:04:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.6 (boo#1171433, jsc#ECO-2308):
  + Extensive memory leak fixing and stress testing was done.
    A big leak in screen sharing with DMA-BUF was fixed.
  + Compile fixes
  + Stability improvements in jack and pulseaudio layers.
  + Added the old portal module to make the Camera portal
    work again. This will be moved to the session manager in
    future versions.
  + Improvements to the GStreamer source and sink shutdown.
  + Fix compatibility with v2 clients again when negotiating
    buffers.
- Disable vulkan if the vulkan package is too old (as in
  SLE 15 SP0 and SP1)
- Add patch to build with meson >= 0.46.0 since 0.50.0 is not
  really needed:
  + fix-meson-required-version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 08:50:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

Wed Apr  1 07:35:48 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Use the License rpm tag to specify that although most of
  pipewire is licensed under MIT,  the pulseaudio replacement
  library is licensed under LGPL-2.1+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 15:11:45 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Use gcc9 to build in SLE-15 / Leap 15, since at least gcc8 is
  needed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 10:48:28 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.2:
  + build fixes
  + Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
    possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
    and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
    format.
  + Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
  + Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
    to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
    negotiate.
  + Fix JACK midi output.
  + Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
    AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
  + Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
    shader.
  + Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
    processing and use the values from the processing
    context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
  + Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
    config file.
  + Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
    cause the server to leak all buffers.
  + Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
  + Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
  + Try to select higher quality formats first when
    negotiating a format with an audio device.
  + Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
  + Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
    do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
    pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
    default and has options to select a different server.
  + Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
    samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.

- Add doxygen, graphviz and xmltoman BuildRequires and pass docs
  and man = true to meson, build documentation. Package docs in a
  new docs sub-package.
- Add check section and run meson_test macro, run tests during
  build.
- Add fdupes BuildRequires and pass fdupes macro, remove duplicate
  files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 16:11:08 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.1:
  + This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
    with previous 0.3.x releases.
  + Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
    sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
    Only enable this for the jack library for now.
  + Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
    signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
    the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
  + Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
  + improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
    warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
    started the operation or is the owner of the object.
  + pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
    in verbose mode
  + fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
  + Fix and update some examples
  + jack: check arguments and don't crash when invalid
  + Fix buffer memory upload.
  + jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
    install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
    handling.
  + fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
  + add support for control ports in pw_filter
  + fix cleanup of the metadata module
  + improve param enumeration.
  + Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
  + Add create-object command in the config file to create
    object from a factory.
  + Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
    nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
  + Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
    about a boolean.
  + pulseaudio: improve compatibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 15:13:15 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

  + fix-memfd_create-call.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 12:32:01 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires for pkgconfig(sndfile) and pkgconfig(vulkan)
  so the vulkan plugin is built.
- Version the spa-plugins subpackage so different versions of
  the plugins can be co-installed in the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 18:54:53 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.0:
  + The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the developement of
    PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
    mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
    layer with comparable performance to JACK2.
  + The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
    developement files and runtime paths are versioned so that
    future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
    exising applications.
  + PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
    that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
    session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
    expected that future version will either switch to a more
    flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
    configuration options of the example session manager.
  + PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
    compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
    of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
    point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
    libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
    compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
    switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
    or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
    anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
    compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.
    PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
    produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
    working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
    to be somewhat problematic for now.
- Add pkgconfig(bluez) and pkgconfig(libpulse) BuildRequires: New
  dependencies.
- Bump libpipewire, apiver and spa_ver define following upstreams
  changes. Also add a new sover define.
- Package new subpackages: libjack-pw0_3_0,
  libpulse-mainloop-glib-pw0_3_0, libpulse-pw0_3_0 and
  libpulse-simple-pw0_3_0, as well as handle them in post(un).
- Adjust options passed to meson following upstreams changes.

  + Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
  + deviceprovider: fix probing without starting
  + add sentinel to some functions
  + compiler fixes for musl
  + Revert object tree permission checks that broke things, this is
    probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
    be removed later)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 16:33:08 UTC 2019 - Markus S <kamikazow@opensuse.org>
