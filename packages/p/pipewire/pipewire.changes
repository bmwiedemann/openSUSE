Wed Jun 26 09:54:23 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.1.83:
  * This is the third and hopefully the last 1.2 release candidate
    that is API and ABI compatible with previous 1.0.x releases.
  * Highlights
    - Rework how peers are linked and the counters are updated.
      Resume the peers when a node is unlinked and not yet
      processed. This should cause less occasional dropouts in the
      graph when reconnecting things.
    - Improve xruns in module-ffado.
    - Many GStreamer element updates.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Rework how peers are linked and the counters are updated.
      Resume the peers when a node is unlinked and not yet
      processed. This should cause less dropouts in the graph when
      reconnecting. (#4026)
    - Improve debug of xruns.
    - Evaluate node.rules and device.rules before loading the
      plugin so that extra properties can be passed to the plugin
      init function.
  * Modules
    - Improve timing reporting in module-ffado some more.
    - Prealloc less memory in the profiler by default.
    - Improve xrun handling in module-ffado.
  * Tools
    - Fix a crash in pw-link when a link fails.
    - Fix pw-dump update for metadata. (#4053)
  * SPA
    - Improve handling of controls. (#4028)
    - Fix the string size in v4l2 to hold the device and vendor id.
    - Support meta_videotransform on buffers in v4l2. This can be
      used to signal that the buffer was rotated for example.
    - Add HDMI/AC3 profile to ALSA when supported.
    - Make it possible to disable the webrtc dependency
  * GStreamer
    - Improve caps handling in the elements.
    - Set buffer duration when we can.
    - Post an element error when all the elements buffers are
      removed. (#1980)
    - Improve DMA_DRM caps selection.
    - Some refactoring work.
    - Improve state handling in the elements.
  * JACK
    - Improve how links are activated.
    - Fix some races when freeing memory.
  * Bluetooth
    - Support multiple BIS in the broadcast source.
- Add patch recommended by upstream to fix compilation for vulkan:
  * 0001-vulkan-fix-compilation.patch

- Update to version 1.1.82:
  * This is the second 1.2 release candidate that is API and ABI
    compatible with previous 1.0.x releases.
  * Highlights
    - Fix problem when moving nodes that could cause nodes to be
      scheduled wrongly and cause errors. (#4017)
    - Add snapcast-discover module to stream to snapcast servers.
    - Work around wrong kernel provided MTU for USB controllers.
    - Fix some spelling mistakes all over the codebase.
    - More small fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Remove the private cleanup.h header and use the public SPA
      version.
    - Fix problem when moving nodes that could cause nodes to be
      scheduled wrongly and cause errors. (#4017)
  * Modules

      allocation.
    - Add snapcast-discover module to stream to snapcast servers.
  * Bluetooth
    - Work around wrong kernel provided MTU for USB controllers.

- Update to version 1.1.81:
  * This is the first 1.2 release candidate that is API and ABI
    compatible with previous 1.0.x releases.
  * Highlights
    - Support for asynchronous processing has been implemented.
      Nodes can choose (or be forced) to be scheduled
      asynchronously. The graph will not wait for the output of the
      node to continue processing but it will use the output of the
      previous cycle (or silence) instead. This adds one cycle of
      latency but it can avoid having some nodes blocking the
      processing graph. Non realtime streams and filters now also
      use this asynchronous processing instead of their own
      slightly broken version.
    - The concept of node.sync-group was added. This groups nodes
      with overlapping sync-group together when one of them sets
      the node.sync = true. This is now used to make sure all nodes
      are scheduled together when JACK transport is started so that
      they all see the same time.
    - Config parsing errors are reported earlier and much better
      with line and column numbers where the parsing started to
      fail.
    - Add support for mandatory metadata when negotiation buffer
      parameters. This can be used to only negotiate extra buffer
      planes when certain metadata is negotiated. One use case is
      the explicit sync support that requires 2 extra fds for the
      timelines.
    - Support was added for making and using multiple data-loops in
      the server and clients. Support for CPU affinity and
      priorities was added to the data-loops as well.
    - The log topic debug levels can now be changed at runtime with
      metadata.
    - The log levels in the pulse server can be dynamically changed
      with a /core message.
    - The UCM conflicting devices patches were merged.
  * PipeWire
    - snap support has been added.
    - Implement async processing. (#3509)
    - Support for explicit sync was added.
    - Config parsing errors are reported earlier and much better.
    - A -P option was added to provide extra properties to the
      context. This can be used to enable some features that use
      rules.
    - properties.rules was added to enhance properties based on
      some rules. This deprecates the vm.overrides.
    - Support was added for security-context. This makes it
      possible for a flatpak to request a socket with specific
      properties from pipewire to mount in the flatpak. The session
      manager can then assign permissions based on the connection
      properties.
    - Support for fixed arrays in pw_array was improved.
    - Pipewire server and clients can now use multiple threads to
      process the nodes in parallel.
    - device.rules and node.rules were added to update device and
      node properties based on rules.
    - device.param and node.param can now be used to configure
      params when devices and nodes are created.
    - Memory will now try to use MFD_NOEXEC_SEAL.
    - The driver id of a node is now placed in the properties.
    - A potential race was fixed when adding and removing ports to
      the scheduling lists.
  * Modules
    - Priorities for the FFADO threads can be configured now.
    - The loopback module now has support for up and downmixing.
    - Extra properties can now be configured per native-connection
      socket.
    - The pulse-tunnel can now automatically reconnect when the
      connection is broken.
    - The RTP module now supports the PTP management protocol.
    - The RTP sender can now use a timer to send out multiple
      packets per quantum.
    - A new module was added for loading Parametric EQ.
    - The simple-protocol module now has per stream configurable
      properties and can also be used to interface with a snapcast
      server.
    - Support for local services was added to raop, rtp and pulse
      avahi discoverers. Support for IPv6 on local services was
      added to RAOP.
  * SPA
    - Support for reporting JSON parsing errors has been added.
    - Some extra checks are added when iterating POD structures.
    - Port and profiles can now be hidden from ALSA nodes with
      api.acp.hidden-ports and api.acp.hidden-profiles properties.
    - The UCM conflicting devices patches were merged.
    - Profiles and Routes can now also be set by name.
    - Hires timestamps are now used when possible in IRQ based
      scheduling to get more accurate wakup times.
    - udev can now be an optional dependency.
    - audioadapter now has an option to automatically configure
      its ports.
    - Camera rotation was added to the libcamera node.
    - invoke on loops can now be done from multiple threads at the
      same time.
    - Make sure we use CLOCK_MONOTONIC everywhere in the io_clock.
    - Vulkan bit and convert filters were added.
    - ALSA will now always read the HW ringbuffer pointer when
      followers are not on the same card.
    - Support for larger MIDI sysex messages was improved.
      Configuration of the client input and output pool was added.
      (#4005)
  * Bluetooth

    - The log level of the pulse server can dynamically be changed
      with a core object message.
    - snap access control was added to pulse-server.
    - The old pacmd describe-module functionality is now
      implemented with a core message
      pipewire-pulse:describe-module.
    - An option was added to disable module loading and unloading.
  * JACK
    - OSC messages can now also be placed in JACK MIDI and the
      translation layer will detect and tag the right PipeWire
      control message types.
    - A jack.other-connect-mode was added to limit the connections
      that an app can do to ports it doesn't own.
    - The way the transport is started and how the nodes are
      grouped together in the transport was improved using the new
      sync groups. (#3850)

- Move the jack spa plugin from the pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2
  package to a new pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2-jack package. This
  allows to not Suggest the pipewire-libjack package from 
  pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2 since that's only used to connect
  pipewire as a client to a jack server which is not common at all
  (boo#1222253).

Tue Mar 12 11:01:21 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Require pipewire-pulseaudio from pipewire-alsa so when
  pipewire-alsa is installed, pipewire has audio support (or put
  in other words, so pipewire-alsa isn't installed with the real
  pulseaudio). Fixes boo#1221235.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 06 17:01:46 UTC 2024 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Add patch from upstream submitted at glfo#pipewire/pipewire#1932

  old and generates broken docs (boo#1217886)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 17:44:12 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add a conflict in -pulseaudio with
  pipewire-modules-%{apiver} < 1.0.0 since the
  libpipewire-module-protocol-pulse.so module was included in
  -modules before 1.0.0 so we should avoid a file conflict.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  7 15:11:14 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.81:
  * Highlights
    - jackdbus support is now enabled by default.
    - IRQ based scheduling in ALSA was improved and enabled by
      default for Pro-Audio profile. It will also link the pcms
      together to get lower latency. This now matches what JACK
      does and gives equal latency to PipeWire for Pro-Audio
      profiles.
    - Support both old and new versions of webrtc-audio-processing
      to make the transition easier.
    - Forced quantum changes by nodes or metadata will now also
      force a suspend and resume of the graph, like the rate
      changes to make sure all nodes adapt to the new quantum.
      This is important for Pro-Audio nodes that need to
      reconfigure the hardware to a new period in IRQ-based
      scheduling.
    - Fix a regression in regex parsing.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - jackdbus is by default enabled now. The idea is that when
      jackdbus is installed, the real libjack.so is in the path and
      we can become a real JACK client.
    - Forces quantum changes by nodes or metadata will now also
      force a suspend and resume in the graph, like the rate
      changes to make sure all nodes adapt to the new quantum.
      This is important for Pro-Audio nodes that need to
      reconfigure the hardware to a new period.
    - The stream now has an EARLY_PROCESS option that can be used
      to implement custom buffer fill levels.
    - Fix a regression in regex parsing.
    - Fix a bug in position reporting in the driver node.
    - Destroying a link will now recalculate the graph correctly.

  * Modules
    - The RAOP sink has seen some cleanups and improvements.
      It will now ask for feedback every 2 seconds to keep some
      devices alive.
    - A bug in filter-chain was fixed where it would fail to apply
      the gain when when mixing just one source.
    - The filter-chain can now pass the stream volume to a control
      in the filter-chain graph.
    - Improve volume handling in RAOP sink.
  * Pulse-server
    - Some cleanup in the pending_stream handling.
    - Fix a regression in the event emission code where it failed
      to emit a changed event when a node was linked.
    - Lower the realtime priority of pulseaudio clients.
    - Set pulse.module.id on the echo-cancel streams.
  * SPA
    - Support both old and new versions of webrtc-audio-processing
      to make the transition easier.
    - The ALSA driver now does the synch of all followers directly
      from the wakeup event. This results in more stable rate
      matching.
    - IRQ based scheduling in ALSA was improved and enabled by
      default for Pro-Audio profile. It will also link the pcms
      together to get lower latency. This now matches what JACK
      does and gives equal latency to PipeWire for Pro-Audio
      profiles.
    - GNU/Hurd support was added.
    - Some improvements to passthrough handling.
  * Bluetooth
    - Improvements to the codec handling when PipeWire is used as
      Audio Gateway.
    - Adapt to new Bluez API for BAP devices.
  * JACK
    - When the jack library is set in the default library path,
      avoid using LD_LIBRARY_PATH because this can cause confusion.
    - Handle clearing the latency on a port.
    - jack_property now always manages to actually change the
      metadata because it waits for a roundtrip before exiting.

Fri Aug 25 09:15:38 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.78:
  * Highlights
    - An old regression was fixed with where some nodes would not
      run.
    - A regression was fixed where removed events would not be

      in audio clients.
    - Fix an off-by-one in the vban audio receiver. Tweak the rate
      adaption a little.
    - ACP will now set a UCM verb before probing the pro-audio

    - More bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - An old regression was fixed with where some nodes would not
      run. (#3405)
    - Suspend was improved a little to avoid races when the session
      manager would suspend right when a driver was starting.
  * Modules
    - module-rtp-sap does not use the deprecated inet_aton anymore.
    - Fix an off-by-one in the vban audio receiver. Tweak the rate
      adaption a little. (#3380)

      encoder resets.
    - Improve enumeration of codec profiles for BAP and A2DP.
  * JACK
    - Ensure we can't iterate ports from a deactivated client. Also
      make sure the JACK clients with the node.always-process=false
      always show their ports. (#3416)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  5 12:23:12 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.77:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a bug in ALSA source where the available number of
      samples was miscaluclated and resulted in xruns in some
      cases.
    - A new L permission was added to make it possible to force a
      link between nodes even when the nodes can't see eachother.
    - The VBAN module now supports midi send and receive as well.
    - Many cleanups and small fixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Global objects now only show permissions that apply to them.
      The permissions required to perform various API calls are
      documented.
    - A new L permission was added to make it possible to force a
      link between nodes even when the nodes can't see eachother.
    - Config files need to end with .conf.
    - The client.api is added the to global properties of a node.
  * modules
    - The VBAN module now supports midi send and receive as well.
    - Fix module-profiler alignment and make sure we don't overrun
      our buffers with many nodes.
    - Protect libcanberra calls with a mutex because it is not
      thread safe.
  * SPA
    - Support older compilers for spa_clear_ptr().
    - Fix a bug in ALSA source where the available number of
      samples was miscaluclated and resulted in xruns.
    - Don't set inotify on /dev but on the videoX devices directly.
      Setting inotify on /dev would cause a lot of spurious wakeups
      and lock contention in the fsnotify subsystem on some
      benchmarks.
    - Audioconvert now rate limits the warnings when it runs out of
      buffers.
  * pulse-server
    - Some bugs and inconsistencies were fixed in device lookup.
    - Improve subscribe event emission, detect changes to the sink
      or the monitor and send the right sink/source event.
  * JACK
    - The libjack.so now has a minor version of 3 and a micro
      version of the pipewire version.
    - JACK clients will now see portregistration from other jack
      clients when they activate/deactivate like real JACK.
  * bluetooth
    - Use some more autoptr cleanups, fix some leaks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 28 10:35:03 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.76:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a regression that would cause the MPV pipewire backend
      to fail because of a spurious thread-loop signal.
    - Fix a crash when DBus is not found.
    - ALSA hires timestamps are now disabled by default.
    - Some more fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - A new option was added to pw-thread-loop to signal when the
      thread starts.
    - This is only used in module-rt to avoid regressions in mpv.
      (#3374)
    - Fix a compilation problem.
    - Stream flags now only set the properties when not already
      set. This fixes a regression with node autoconnect. (#3382)
  * Tools
    - pw-cat will now stop when the stream is disconnected. (#2731)
    - Improve the pw-cat man page, mention that stdin/stdout
      handling is only on raw data.
  * modules
    - module-rt will now not crash when dbus is not available but
      error out as before.
    - A new VBAN (vb-audio.com) sender and receiver was added.
      (#3380)
  * SPA
    - Add an option in audioconvert to disable volume updates.
      (#3361)
    - ALSA hires timestamps are disabled by default because many
      drivers seem to give wrong timestamps and cause extra delay.
  * bluetooth
    - LE Audio support is now enabled by default when liblc3 is
      available now that bluez has support for detecting the
      hardware features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 25 08:19:55 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add code in the spec file to modify the patch file 
  reduce-meson-dependency.patch (used to build in SLE/Leap) so that
  we don't need to rebase it manually for every version update.
- Use gcc 11 in SLE/Leap since gcc 9 fails to build 0.3.75 with
  ../spa/include/spa/utils/cleanup.h:52:13: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘DIR’ {aka ‘struct __dirstream’}
     52 |  __typeof__(*(ptr)) *_old_value = spa_steal_ptr(ptr); \

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 23 01:16:45 UTC 2023 - llyyr <llyyr.public@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.75:
  * Highlights
    - Link permissions between nodes are now enforced. This avoids 
      potential portal managed screencast nodes to link to the
      camera even though it was not assigned permissions to do so
      by the session manager (boo#1213682).
    - Libcamera and v4l2 devices now have properties so that 
      duplicates can be filtered out by the session manager.
    - A bug with draining was fixed where a buffer would be marked 
      EMPTY and would not play when it contained drained samples.
    - Many fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Permissions for links between nodes are now enforced. The
      link will now check that the owner clients of the nodes can
      see each other before allowing the link. This avoids
      screensharing clients to accidentally being linked to the
      camera nodes by the session manager. A side effect is that
      patchbay tools will no longer be able to link portal managed
      screencast nodes to the camera, for this we need a new
      permission for those patchbay clients.
    - The stream.rules/filter.rules are now evaluated when
      connecting the stream/filter so that more properties can be
      matched.
    - Move some internal events from the context to the nodes to
      better handle per-node threads in the future.
    - The thread-loop will now signal when the thread is started.
  * modules
    - A timestamp workaround in module-raop was reverted because it 
      does not work in all cases. Instead latency was increased to 
      1.5 seconds, which also makes the problematic device in 
      question work.
    - The profiler module was reworked a bit to use the new node 
      realtime events. It should now also handle dynamically added
      and removed drivers.
    - The module-rt now does the rtkit calls from a separate thread 
      so that it does not block the main thread. This could cause 
      deadlocks during startup in some cases.
  * SPA
    - Atomic operation macros were move from internal pipewire API
      to public API.
    - The video-info structure now has a new 
      SPA_VIDEO_FLAG_MODIFIER_FIXATION_REQUIRED flag to instruct
      the application to fixate the modifiers. This simplifies some
      logic in applications a lot.
    - The libcamera and v4l2 nodes now have properties to enumerate 
      the device id they are using. This can be used to match v4l2
      devices and libcamera devices and filter out duplicates.
    - A bug with draining was fixed where a buffer would be marked 
      EMPTY and would not

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 12 10:03:52 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.74:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a critical bug where audio to bluetooth devices would cut
      out randomly.
    - Improve RAOP compatibility.
    - Avoid crashes after an update.
    - Small fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Mix info on port is now created explicitly.
    - Remove the node as a driver peer when stopping. This caused
      some problem with playback on and other remote bluetooth
      devices.
    - Work on avoiding crashes when loading new modules that use
      internal API with old libpipewire. This is typical after an
      update where the old library is still loaded by an
      application but when a new stream is created, updated modules
      are loaded.
  * Modules
    - The RTP source module now has an option to ignore the SSRC,
      which is useful to continue to receive the stream when the
      sender is restarted.
    - The native protocol will refuse to load twice now instead of
      silently ignoring the error.
    - module-raop is compatible with more devices.
  * SPA
    - plugins will now warn when running out of buffers. This is
      always a bad thing.
    - Merge scope based cleanup macros.
    - Add ratelimit function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  8 15:24:48 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.73:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes an ALSA resume after suspend error.
    - Handle and disable seemingly wrong hires timestamps from
      ALSA.
    - Filter-chain now has loadable plugin modules. The LV2 and
      sofa plugins are moved to a separate .so file to make things
      more modular.
    - Rate changes in the graph should now be handled more
      gracefully by loopback and filter-chain.
    - A regression in the rtp-sap module was fixed where it would
      in some cases fail to start.
    - A potential crash in the peaks resampler was fixed.
    - Many cleanups and other small bug fixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a potential segfault when no fallback driver was set in
      the config.
    - Improve OPUS detection.
    - Add ASYNC flag to pw-filter and pw-stream when queue/dequeue
      is not called from the process function. This ensure we
      allocate an extra buffer.
    - Discard pending process callbacks when disconnecting.
    - Cleanups and improvements to the debug environment variable
      parsing.
    - The graph rate was tweaked to better handle very low rates
      such as those requested by pavucontrol when it does the
      signal monitoring.
  * Modules
    - An example filter module was added.
    - Filter-chain and loopback now disable the resamplers if no
      rate is specified and will always follow the graph rate.
    - Improve setup of filter-chain. The graph is now created when
      starting because this ensure the target graph rate is known.
    - Filter-chain can now link notify ports to control ports in
      the graph.
    - Filter-chain now has loadable plugin modules. The LV2 and
      sofa plugins are moved to a separate .so file.
    - A regression in the rtp-sap module was fixed where it would
      in some cases fail to start.
    - Module-rt now has options to disable rlimits, portal and
      rtkit.
    - module-raop-discover now has an options to set the latency.
  * Tools
    - pw-cat now supports overriding all stream properties.
  * SPA
    - Disable rate negotiation when the resampler is disabled. We
      will always follow the graph rate. 
    - Set device.icon property for UCM ports as well.
    - Improve ALSA recover when using hires timestamps. This fixes
      some problems after resume from suspend.
    - ALSA will now warn and disable hires timestamp when they seem
      wrong.
      They can also be disabled manually with a property.
    - V4l2 will now gracefully handle ENOTTY when enumerating frame
      sizes and frame rates.
    - A potential crash in the peaks resampler was fixed.
  * pulse-server
    - A client crash in pavucontrol is avoided by always setting a
      card name.
    - The graph rate is now taken correctly when using the FIX
      flags.
    - An option was added to ignore the FIX flags of a stream. Also
      the documentation for those options was updated.
    - module-raop-discover now support latency_msec.
  * Bluetooth
    - Remove an assert and issue a warning/recover instead when a
      buffer is too small.
  * GStreamer
    - The device provider does locking when destroying the
      registry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 26 09:30:37 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.72:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a critical bug that would refuse to update the samplerate
      or buffersize in JACK clients.
    - A new module-netjack2-driver and module-netjack2-manager were
      added that are compatible with NETJACK2. This allows PipeWire
      to become a NETJACK2 manager or a driver between JACK2 or
      PipeWire servers.
    - Support was added for firewire devices with FFADO. This is
      untested for now and MIDI is not implemented yet.
    - The node scheduling was optimized some more. External drivers
      are now as efficient as in-server ones. This should improve
      performance of various drivers such as bluetooth and JACK
      based drivers.
    - Many, many bug fixes and a ton of improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - pw-filter can now be used to write sinks and sources.
    - The node activation for drivers was changed. The driver now
      does not need to go to the server to start the processing
      cycle. This makes out-of-server drivers as efficient as
      in-server drivers.
    - Don't try to use drivers with 0 priority as fallback drivers.
      This avoids making the screencast driver a driver for audio.
    - Improve xrun count reporting in pw-top and the profiler. Now
      each node has their own xrun counter updated when it fails to
      complete processing during the cycle.
    - pw-filter now also has support for TRIGGER.
    - A potential fd leak was found when fds were send to a zombie
      client.
    - Fix a bug where monitor or capture streams were logged twice
      in the profiler.
    - Remove stream hooks safely.
    - A bug in serialization of container properties was fixed.
      This could result in truncated property values.
    - The PIPEWIRE_AUTOCONNECT environment variable now always
      overrides the autoconnect settings of streams.
    - Node, port and link destroy now avoids some useless work.
    - Port will now try to renegotiate a new format when idle.
  * Modules
    - The module-sap now is more compatible with AES67.
    - A new FFADO driver module was added. This is completely
      untested because of lack of hardware. Please test and report
      issues.
    - A new NETJACK2 driver and a NETJACK2 manager module were
      added. These should be drop in replacements for the JACK2
      parts.
    - The RAOP discover module now tries harder to only list
      devices once.
    - The zeroconf discover module now tries harder to only list
      devices once.
    - The RAOP sink module now handles latency better and is
      compatible with some more devices.
    - The loopback and filter-chain modules now always dequeue the
      last input buffer to avoid stuttering in some cases.
    - The SPA node factory module can now also export nodes. This
      is used to export the PTP clock from the AES67 config file.
    - A bug in module-jack-tunnel was fixed that would cause
      stuttering and corrupted output in some cases.
    - The resampler is now disabled in module-loopback and
      filter-chain when the samplerate is set to follow the graph
      rate.
    - The way the mixer peer is sent to clients was improved. It is
      now also possible to let a remote node know about mixer port
      removes, which can avoid memory leaks and some code
      simplifications.
  * SPA
    - Monitor ports now report latency correctly.
    - The ALSA plugin now uses htimestamp to get a more accurate
      ringbuffer position to estimate the clock skew.
    - The channelmixer now has min/max-volume settings to limit or
      fix the volume.
    - The ALSA plugin can now control the playback and capture rate
      of USB gadgets. This can avoid resampling and instead use the
      USB feedback to control the rate.
    - The ALSA output to multiple devices has been improved, some
      lockups are avoided when the device ringbuffer is full.
    - The compress-offload sink has improved negotiation.
  * pulse-server
    - Only try to use GSettings when the schema exists.
    - @DEFAULT_SOURCE@, @DEFAULT_SINK@ and @DEFAULT_MONITOR@ are
      now correctly handled as targets in playback and capture
      streams.
    - 2 new quirks are added to disable volume updates on
      sinks/sources.
    - The virtual-sink and virtual-source modules were added. These
      are really example modules but actually also work and are
      useful on PulseAudio so implement them as well.
    - Fix initial stream volumes.
  * Bluetooth
    - Only register A2DP or BAP when we have codecs.
    - Include codec into the media.name
  * JACK
    - Fix a critical bug that would refuse to update the samplerate
      or buffersize.
    - Improve updates of samplerate/buffersize, delay the updates
      until the client is activated.
    - Use the new mix-info updates to simplify the mixer setup and
      peer detection.
  * GStreamer
    - Fill default strides instead of 0 on pipewire video buffers.
- Remove patch already included upstream:
  * 0001-jack-update-bufsize-and-samplerate-when-skipping-not.patch
- Move libjack* conflicts from package pipewire-libjack-0_3 (which
  has coinstallable libraries) to pipewire-jack (which includes
  the ld.so.conf.d file).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 31 06:50:17 UTC 2023 - Dominique Leuenberger <dleuenberger@suse.com>

- Have pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2 suggest pipewire-libjack-%{apiver_str}:
  this package requires libjack.so.0, so we best use our own
  implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 17:26:12 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Add patch from upstream to fix JACK buffersize updates:
  * 0001-jack-update-bufsize-and-samplerate-when-skipping-not.patch
- Create a pipewire-jack package that provides jack-daemon (and
  conflicts with any other) and requires the pipewire-libjack
  library.
  Move the ld configuration from pipewire-libjack, so that only
  pipewire-jack forces PipeWire to be the default JACK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 15:18:10 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.71:
  * Highlights
    - A new zero-latency jackdbus bridge was added. This works
      similar to what PulseAudio has to offer and creates a
      sink/source when jackdbus is started. It is however much more
      efficient and runs the complete PipeWire graph as a
      synchronous JACK client with no added latency.
    - Many performance improvements. Activation of remote nodes is
      more efficient, fewer eventfds are required on the clients,
      less callback overhead in performence critical paths and an
      optimized poll function was added. This was mainly driven by
      the jackdbus module to get the lowest possible overhead when
      running the graph.
    - The JACK notify callback implementation was reworked to
      emulate better what JACK does, improving compatibility with
      ardour7 and the JACK stress test.
    - More work on BAP devices. Device latency is now passed on to
      applications also for multi-device headsets, and channel
      allocation is handled better.
    - Many more improvements and bugfixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Remove the hardcoded limit on io_areas. This is used to link
      nodes together and exchange buffers, it was limited to 2048
      but now dynamically scales based on requirements.
    - Rate and quantum changes are now applied correctly in more
      cases. (#3159)
    - Updates to client-node to more efficiently process the
      driver.
    - The profiler information was improved to be more accurate.
      It should now work better for remote drivers.
    - Some potential memory map errors were fixed in the protocol
      because in some case with large messages, some fds were
      closed too soon.
    - pw-filter now implements the pw_filter_set_active() method.
    - A potential out-of-buffers case was fixed in capture
      pw-streams where buffers were not moved to the recycle queue
      when the node suspended.
    - Nodes are now always woken up with the eventfd. Previously
      there were some optimiztions in the server to directly call
      into the node process function but that optimization is not
      necessary. Without this optimization it is now possible to
      run nodes in different threads.
    - pw-stream trigger is now implemented correctly in all cases.
    - Remote nodes now use one eventfd less because they get
      triggered with the node eventfd directly.
    - Monitor ports are now ignored in latency updates.
    - A potential race when reporting an error to a client was
      fixed. (#3192)
    - Fix a bug where always_process nodes would sometimes IDLE.
      (#3189)
    - Optimize peer activation. Nodes are now activated more
      efficiently and independent of the number of links. It also
      reduces the number of eventfds and memory in remote clients.
    - A bug in property serialization was fixed. Values with spaces
      would only serialize the first part of the value.
  * Modules
    - Correctly handle the echo-canceler plugin init method
      fallback. The samplerate was not correctly configured. This
      is only a regression for people that have external
      echo-canceler plugins.
    - RAOP sink now only sets the volume on the remote end when the
      stream is recording. (#3175)
    - RAOP discover now tries to deduplicate entries from the same
      host.
    - A new zero-latency jackdbus bridge was added. This works
      similar to what pulseaudio has to offer and creates a
      sink/source when jackdbus is started. It is however much more
      efficient and runs the complete PipeWire graph as a
      synchronous JACK client.
    - The access module uses a more secure way to check the
      application executable.
    - module-combine-stream now has configurable delay and latency
      for each stream. This can be used to align sinks/sources with
      different latencies.
    - A potential crash in module-pulse-tunnel was fixed when
      shutting down. (#3199)
    - Module-rt will now clamp the nice value to the min allowed
      value to avoid errors from rtkit. (#3186)
    - Fix a bug with the session counters in module-rtp-sap. Also
      use the right format for L24. Improve the AES67 example
      config.
    - Improve some warning and info messages in module-rt. (#3194)
    - module-rtp-session should now do something when started
      without arguments.
    - A potential crash in module-rtp-session was fixed. (#3217)
    - module-filter-chain has better error reporting when a
      convolver fails to load. (#3223)
  * SPA
    - Move some things around to avoid compiler warnings. (#3171)
    - Increase mixer ports. Reorganize some things and bump mixer
      input ports from 128 to 512.
    - Fix a potential crash when a node is scheduled before it
      completes the setup.
    - The JACK sink and source SPA plugins have seen some
      improvements.
    - Allow the peaks resampler still if we disabled resampling.
    - Perform more cleanup in audioadapter when in error.
    - An optimized non-cancellable loop implementation was added.
    - Callbacks were optimized with a _fast() varsion that doesn't
      check the version and method. When this check is performed
      earlier, it can be skipped in performance critical places.
    - Some of the callbacks and system methods are now using the
      fast function calls in critical paths.
    - A potential division by zero was fixed in the ALSA plugins.
    - Improve rate and quantum when starting audioconvert.
    - Make it possible to override node.driver in the SPA
      null-audio-driver. (#3220)
  * pulse-server
    - The audio info parameter parsing was refactored and improved.
    - Fix some races with clients exiting when playing samples.
    - An option was added to change or disable the dbus name
      registration. (#2987)
  * Bluetooth
    - Implement battery reporting using AT+XEVENT.
    - Disable hardware volume for 3M WorkTunes.
    - Implement BAP audio locations (channel positions) by using
      the new bluez properties.
  * JACK
    - Fix some errors reported by JACK test.cpp. (#2638)
    - Add jack.show-midi option to show/hide midi ports.
    - Add jack.max-client-ports option. JACK also has a port limit
      and so PipeWire needs it as well to make the tests happy.
    - Call the shutdown callback only when the server stopped, not
      when there is a random error. (#3070)
    - Avoid registering the same port name twice.
    - Call port registration callbacks in activate/deactivate.
    - Improve jack_port_connected().
    - Improve some error reporting.
    - The JACK headers were updated to a newer version.
    - JACK callbacks are now managed with an event queue to
      simulate more what JACK does. This avoids emiting callbacks
      when a method is blocking for a reply and causing deadlocks.
      (#3183)
    - Assign unique names to JACK clients. (#2833)
    - Fix a potential crash when the thread_utils was used after
      free.
    - Aliases are now not filled in by default to improve JACK
      compatibility. (#3154)
  * ALSA
    - The ALSA plugin will now wait for negotiation to complete or
      an error before _prepare() completes. This makes more
      applications deal correctly with the potential errors.
  * Docs
    - A new document about how scheduling is implemented was added.
    - Update the pw-cli man page. (#2988)
    - Document the SPA Pod serialization.
    - Document the PipeWire native protocol.

      changes to the remote end.
    - More bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a bug in the graph scheduler where some nodes might stay
      IDLE in some cases (like when connecting the source of the
      echo-canceler to the sink).
    - pw-metadata can now be created from the factory with initial
      values for the metadata. (#3076)
    - Conditions were added to the pipewire config file to make it
      possible to configure the access module and the exec sections.
    - Support was added in pw-stream to intercept and override
      properties for the adapter. This can be used to implement
      custom volume control, for example.
  * Tools
    - pw-metadata can now list all available metadata objects with
      the -l option.
    - A new pw-config tool was added to debug configuration file
      loading and parsing.
  * Modules
    - The webrtc echo canceler now supports beamforming. You can
      provide the coordinates of the microphones and let webrtc
      perform beamforming on the captured samples to improve
      quality and remove noise.
    - Fix a regression in the filter-chain with biquad filters.
      (#3161) and improve error reporting.
    - The pulse-tunnel will now proxy the volume changes to the
      remote end.
    - The RAOP sink will now send volume parameters to control the
      volume remotely. (#2061)
  * SPA
    - One ALSA commit was not correctly reverted and might cause 
      crashes.
    - The ALSA sink and source now calculate the ALSA ringbuffer
      memory location more correctly wich might improve
      compatibility with some hardware.
    - v4l2 now sets the values of the controls in the Props param.
  * Pulse-server
    - The echo-canceler aec_args are now parsed like they would be
      under pulseaudio.
  * Bluetooth
    - More work on synchronizing BAP devices.
  * GStreamer
    - The GStreamer source can now renegotiate the format when it
      changes.
    - The GStreamer source now uses the BaseSrc clocking code to
      implement the clock and timing code.
- Rebase patch:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 19:23:05 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.69:
  * Highlights:
    - Reverted the UCM changes, they seem to cause regressions
      causing audio to be muted in some cases.
    - Fix a regression in the scheduler where a driver node might
      not be marked as runnable in some cases, like when
      echo-cancel is used.
    - Handle links from the driver to itself. This makes the midi
      bridge work again.
    - ALSA rate matching for sources was fixed. It would previously
      wait too long for rate matching and then cause drift. This
      should reduce crackling and stuttering whan capturing in
      low latency.
    - Fix the GStreamer clock to make cheese video recording work
      again.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire:
    - Fix a regression in the scheduler where a driver node might
      not be marked as runnable in some cases, like when
      echo-cancel is used.
    - Handle links from the driver to itself. This makes the midi
      bridge work again.
    - Some man pages were improved.
    - Fix a potential crash when thread-loop is destroyed before
      the loop.
  * Modules:
    - A new raw biquad filter was added to filter-chain. You can
      manually set the 6 parameters and you can use this to create
      custom filters per sample rate.
    - The echo-canceller now supports different channels for the
      capture and playback streams.
  * SPA:
    - A SB Audigy specific profile set was added to make better use
      of the controls.
    - More ALSA IRQ based scheduling improvements.
    - ALSA rate matching for sources was fixed. It would previously
      wait too long for rate matching and then cause drift. This
      should reduce crackling and stuttering whan capturing in
      low latency.
    - The echo-cancel plugin API has a new method to make it
      possible to have different channels for capture, source and
      playback.
    - Reverted the UCM changes, they seem to cause regressions
      causing audio to be muted in some cases.
  * Bluetooth:
    - Many more BAP fixes and improvements. Devices are now
      created as a set and can be combined into one device by the
      session manager.
  * GStreamer:
    - Fix the GStreamer clock to make cheese video recording work
      again.
- Enable gstreamer-device-provider (rh#2183691).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  6 14:12:51 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.68:
  * Highlights:
    - Symbolic links to the pipewire binary are now used instead of
      recompiling the same binary multiple times.
    - Changes to the graph scheduler related to quantum/rate
      updates and calculation of the node states. Things should
      start and switch between quantums and rates more smoothly now
      and especially virtual devices should now only run when
      required.
    - A new RTP session module was added. This uses the Apple MIDI
      protocol to configure low-latency bidirectional MIDI (and
      with a PipeWire specific extension, also audio) between
      machines. OPUS encoding was added to the RTP formats.
      The SAP module was separated from the rtp-sink/source module
      to make it more usable.
    - A new runtime debug property was added to all streams and
      nodes to trigger a save of the raw samples to a wav file.
      Support for this has also been added to the echo-canceler to
      debug potential issues.
    - Module pulse-tunnel has improved rate matching and
      synchronisation support. It should also not drift anymore for
       capture devices.
    - The link-factory now ignores by default the link.passive
      property. This means that tools like pw-link or jack clients
      and wireplumber can't make passive links anymore. The reason
      is that there is now much more advanced logic in PipeWire
      itself to handle passive links based on node and port
      properties.
    - The RAOP sink was ported to new OpenSSL functions. Digest
      passwords are handled correctly now and support for more
      devices was added.
    - The ACP code was updated with new PulseAudio UCM code:
      "Create multiple profiles per verb for conflicting devices".
      This might change the names of devices, profiles and ports so
      scripts might need to be updated.
    - Upmixing is disabled again by default. We now ship config
      files that distros can install to enable upmixing again. The
      reason being that PipeWire should not apply fancy DSP
      processing to audio by default.
    - Many cleanups and bugfixes, including some crashes and memory
      corruption bugs.
  * PipeWire:
    - Don't crash when calling _connect twice in stream/filter.
    - Links are now installed instead of compiling the pipewire
      binary multiple times.
    - There is now a new core event bound_props that augments the
      bound_id event with the global properties. This can be used
      to get the global.serial among other global properties.
      It also makes it possible in the future to let the server
      allocate unique names or uuids.
    - Fix a bug where the server could go into an infinite
      reconfigure loop when the samplerate of a driver would
      change.
    - When a samplerate was forced, restore the previous best
      samplerate when the samplerate is no longer forced.
    - Rework how the states of the nodes in the graph are
      calculated. A more refined algorithm is now used that only
      runs nodes that need to run.
    - Rework how the quantum change is applied to the graph.
      Drivers are now responsible for using the new updated
      rate/quantum before starting a new cycle. This avoids
      starting a cycle with an old quantum first.
    - pw-stream and pw-filter will now ensure that the Trigger
      event is called from the main thread.
    - node.force-rate=0 will now force the node.rate on the graph,
      forcefully switching the hardware into the new rate if
      possible.
    - Additional checks were added to the thread-loop to check
      locking order.
    - Additional checks were added to pw-stream and pw-filter to
      check if methods are called from the right thread context.
  * modules:
    - A new RTP session module was added. This uses the Apple MIDI
      protocol to configure bidirectional MIDI (or audio) between
      machines.
    - SAP support was removed from module-rtp-source and
      module-rtp-sink and moved to a separate module. This makes it
      possible to use the RTP modules without SAP support as well.
    - The echo-cancel module now has support to save the signals to
      a wav file for debugging purposes.
    - The RTP modules now have support for the OPUS codec.
    - The RAOP module was ported to new openssl encryption
      functions and handles digest passwords correctly now.
    - module-raop-discover now has match rules to be able to select
      the streams and set properties.
    - Module pulse-tunnel has improved rate matching and
      synchronisation support.
    - Fix potential memory corruption and infinite loops because
      module-pulse-tunnel was unloaded from the wrong thread. 
    - The link-factory now ignores by default the link.passive
      property. This means that tools like pw-link or jack clients
      and wireplumber can't make passive links anymore. The reason
      is that there is now much more advanced logic in PipeWire
      itself to handle passive links based on node and port
      properties.
    - module-echo-cancel will now clear its buffers after a suspend
      to avoid playing stray samples.
    - module-raop-sink will now handle 0 timing_port replies.
  * SPA:
    - The adapter module now has support for saving the raw audio
      to a wav file for debugging purposes.
    - The ACP code was updated with new PulseAudio UCM code:
      "Create multiple profiles per verb for conflicting devices".
      This might change the names of devices, profiles and ports so
      scripts might need to be updated.
    - Upmixing was disabled again by default. We now ship config
      files that distros can install to enable upmixing again.
    - audioadapter and audioconvert have seen improvements in the
      experimental non-DSP/passthrough mode.
    - Fix a potential race where the dummy drivers could fail to
      stop a timer and cause endless warnings in the logs.
    - The ALSA plugin has experimental support for IRQ based
      scheduling. This should decrease latency for some
      (mostly USB) drivers. This should bring latency within JACK
      latency.
    - Audioconvert now has support for volume ramping.
    - A new loop method was added the check if a thread is
      currently running the loop.
    - channelmix.disable and resample.disable now generate an error
      when true and channelmixing or resampling is required in the
      converter.
  * Bluetooth:
    - Fix a crash in some cases when a device was disconnected.
    - Support async transport state changes. This avoids some
      lockups when the bluetooth backend is having issues.
    - Align BAP sinks. This improves synchronization between
      earpieces.
  * ALSA:
    - Improve properties in pw-top and pavucontrol.
  * pulse-server:
    - Improve error handling from pulse-tunnel.
    - Generate silence correctly for unsigned formats as well.
    - Review buffer params. The streams should now just work with
      1 or 2 buffers.
    - module-rtp-send and module-rtp-recv now have support for the
      OPUS codec.
  * JACK:
    - Make sure we don't call any callbacks anymore when
      deactivating.
  * GStreamer:
    - Sort the device by priority in deviceprovider.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 19 08:51:17 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add pkgconfig(lc3) BuildRequires, and pass
  bluez5-codec-lc3=enabled to meson.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  9 13:57:10 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.67:
  * Highlights:
    - The loopback module and other couples streams will now not
      randomly fail in some cases.
    - The RTP module now has support for sending and receiving MIDI
      as well.
    - The compress offload sink has seen many improvements. It now
      uses ioctls directly to bypass limitations of tinycompress
      (to be able to detect the available codecs, for example).
    - Pulse server compatibility was improved for some apps by
      improving the format parsing and FIX_ stream flag handling.
    - The min quantum in the pulse server was changed from
      256/48000 to 128/48000 to fix some issues with games that
      expect 5ms or less of latency.
    - The Bluetooth plugin has seen many improvements in packet
      scheduling to attempt to reduce stuttering on some devices.
    - The ALSA plugin now handles some impossible cases better.
      This fixes recording in QEMU again.
  * PipeWire:
    - SPDX tags were added to the code for copyright information.
    - The random number functions were made more usable.
    - The port property code was moved from the adapter to the port
      implementation itself to make it more useful and unified for
      the cases where no adapter is used (midi and video).
    - Fix a potential overflow in mixer areas.
    - Improve runnable state calculations of nodes. This is part of
      ongoing work to avoid running nodes that should not need to
      run.
    - The stream will now always call the process function when
      using trigger, even if there are no buffers. This avoids
      stalls of the processing graph in some cases.
    - Links are now marked as passive by PipeWire itself so that
      the right thing happens in all cases.
    - Implement the in/out/true values for the node.passive
      property.
    - Place a passive state on ports to make passive links on a
      port by port basis.
  * Tools: pw-cat has seen improvements in the encoded file
    playback case.
  * Modules:
    - The rtp module has support for MIDI now.
    - DSCP is now configurable in the RTP module.
    - The loopback module doesn't randomly fail to work anymore.
  * SPA:
    - The null-audio sink can now be given a format and it will
      return this instead of the default float ones. This makes it
      possible to make a null-sink that has a given format.
    - The compress offload sink has seen many improvements. It now
      no longer uses tinycompress to be able to detect the
      available codecs.
    - The ALSA plugin now handles some impossible cases better.
    - Fix compilation on older compilers.
  * Pulse-server:
    - The FIX_ flags are now implemented more correctly by fixating
      the stream to the format of the sink/source they ask to be
      connected to.
    - There is now also an option to override the fixation based on
      rules.
    - Format parsing was improved and should now support all format
      strings supported by pulseaudio including upper and lower
      case variants and shortcuts.
    - Channelmap parsing was improved and should now reject invalid
      channelmaps as well as support the shortcuts supported by
      pulseaudio.
    - Escape codes in module arguments now work as it does in
      pulseaudio.
    - The min quantum was changed from 256/48000 to 128/48000 to
      fix some issues with games that expect 5ms or less of
      latency.
  * JACK:
    - jack.passive-links can now be used to have a JACK client make
      passive links and the node.passive property is no longer used
      for this because it has a different function.
    - The qsynth rule was updated to the new node.passive features.
      It is now only passive on the output side.
  * Bluetooth:
    - BAP delay and transport latency are handled now.
    - A2DP and SCO can now use bigger buffers to improve quality
      when the reception is jittery.
    - The AT+BCC command is now implemented.
    - Packet encoding now happens ahead of time when possible to
      avoid delays before sending it.
    - Source should now always produce complete (padded) buffers to
      avoid sync problems.
    - Don't set unnecessary socket options.
  * GStreamer:
    - The pipewiresrc now has an autoconnect argument.
    - The metadata plane count is now handled correctly in more
      cases.
    - Stream errors are now handled correctly to stop the GStreamer
      elements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 13:08:53 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add a suggests on the pipewire-jack packages to avoid the jack
  versions getting picked for dependency resolution

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 16 13:08:02 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.66:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a regression in the pulseaudio module-combine-stream
      because the new module-combine-stream was not installed.
    - PipeWire can now generate a limits.d config file with our
      recommended settings for priorities and memlock.
    - Modules, exec and objects can now be loaded depending on
      conditions. One example is the X11-bell module that can now
      be disabled with a custom property override.
    - Filter-chain has a new mysofa based spacialiser plugin.
    - Support was added for different clocks that allow the RTP
      modules to work with a PTP clock, for example.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Avoid rate switches when the graph is idle.
    - The rate selection algorithm was improved. This ensures
      minimal performance and quality loss when resampling.
    - The default min.quantum was set to 32 again after it got
      erronously changed to (the too low) 16 in version 0.3.45.
    - Fix compilation issues with rust bindings because of macros
      in defines. Work around it for now.
    - Invalid file mappings are now refused.
    - Modules, exec and objects can now be loaded depending on
      conditions. One example is the X11-bell module that can now
      be disabled with a custom property override.
    - Filter now also supports _trigger_process() to drive the
      graph.
    - TID is now added to the journald log.
    - PipeWire generates and installs
      `/etc/security/limits.d/25-pw-rlimits.conf` that by default
      contains project's recommended settings. Creation of the
      pipewire group is left to the distro or user
      ( `groupadd -r pipewire` ). See the rlimits-* Meson options
      for controlling this behaviour.
    - Additionally there is now by default disabled Meson option
      that will install
      `/etc/security/limits.d/20-pw-defaults.conf` with the current
      Linux default memlock value. Distros with only kernels >=5.16
      or always using systemd v251 or newer do not need this.
      But all other builds should set the
      `-Dpam-defaults-install=true` Meson option to ensure that the
      memlock value is always large enough.
  * modules
    - Install module-combine-stream.
    - RTP source now has support for custom channel names.
    - RTP source will now stop when inactive.
    - Filter-chain has a new mysofa based spacializer plugin.
    - The RTP modules can now use direct clock timestamps to send
      and receive packets. This makes it possible to synchronise
      sender and receiver with a PTP clock, for example.
    - Filter-chain now has an invert plugin to invert the polarity
      of a signal.
  * SPA
    - There is now an option to set the channels used for probing
      Pro Audio devices. This could unlock more samplerates for
      some devices when they are probed with fewer channels.
    - Support was added for other clocks than the MONOTONIC clock
      in the driver nodes. This can be used to synchronise the
      graph to a PTP clock, for example.
    - The ALSA source has some more headroom when rate matching to
      avoid stuttering when following another driver.
    - libcamera controls are now mapped to standard PipeWire
      property values.
    - The channelmixer has seen some improvements.
      MONO and undefined channel layouts are now upmixed and
      downmixed more correctly.
  * Bluetooth
    - Many BAP support fixes.
  * GStreamer
    - The gstreamer elements now support buffer video metadata so
      that strides are correctly handled.
    - pipewiresrc will now error out correctly in more cases.
  * JACK
    - The frame to/from time functions are improved to also work
      with negative time and frame offsets.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-modules-also-install-module-combine-stream.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 26 12:21:31 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.65:
  * Highlights
    - Add back the deprecated symbols but make sure a deprecated
      warning is emitted for them. This fixes compilation issues in
      bindings.
    - Fix an error in the AVX code that could cause crackling in
      filter-chain when using the mixer.
    - The convolver in filter-chain can now select an IR from a
      list of IRs that best matches the current samplerate. Also
      resampling of the IR  has been improved.
    - A new native module-combine-stream was added. You can use
      this to create a 5.1 device from 3 stereo soundcards, for
      example, or direct the output to multiple sinks at once.
    - Support for Bluetooth MIDI was added. This requires a
      wireplumber addition as well.
    - An ALSA plugin rule was added to tweak the buffer settings in
      Davinci Resolve so that it now runs with acceptable latency.
    - Support for compress offload was added using tinycompress.
      This allows compressed formats to be decoded in hardware
      using ALSA on some devices.
    - Many more buffixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Add back the deprecated symbols but make sure a deprecated
      warning is emitted for them.
    - Fix a regression when running older servers and newer clients
      (such as flatpaks on older server) where the server would run
      clients too soon, causing crashes.
    - Ensure that environment variables override any config values.
  * Tools
    - pw-cli has received some improvements in the output.
    - pw-cat can now use ffmpeg to demux streams for compress
      offload.
  * modules
    - The convolver IR volume is now preserved after resampling.
    - Adapter ports can now have a custom prefix.
    - module-rt now clamps the realtime priority to the user
      allowed one if it is within an acceptable range. Before it
      would fall back to RTKit immediately.
    - The module-echo-cancel can now have per stream channel
      layouts which makes it possible to link to specific audio
      ports on a device.
    - Fix an error in the AVX code that could cause crackling in
      filter-chain when using the mixer.
    - The convolver in filter-chain can now select an IR from a
      list of IRs that best matches the current sample-rate.
    - module-pipe-* now better matches the pulseaudio properties.
    - A new combine-stream module was added to combine multiple
      sinks into one sink. It is also possible to merge multiple
      sources into one.
    - module-rtp-source now has match rules to select what SAP
      sessions to stream from. There were also improvements to the
      buffering and latency handling.
    - module-rtp-sink now handles multicast loopback correctly.
    - module-rtp-sink implements min-ptime and max-ptime to control
      the send packet latency.
  * SPA
    - A new modifier flag was added to the video format parser
      helper to allow 0 (linear) as a valid modifier.
    - Params includes were reorganized to make it more scalable.
      Many compressed audio formats were added.
    - The alsa pcm plugin now handles invalid values from the
      driver gracefully.
    - Fix some potential stuttering cause by wrong scaling and
      overflow of the output buffers in audioconvert.
    - Debug output is now also sent to the log instead of stdout.
    - A debug context was added to debug macros to implement custom
      debug handling. This is used to redirect the debug of pods to
      the debug log instead of using some custom duplicated code.
    - Fix some warnings for potentially undefined shifts in format
    conversion.
    - Support for compress offload was added using tinycompress.
      This is mostly used on some embedded hardware where decoding
      of audio formats can be done in hardware.
  * Bluetooth
    - Some fixes for LE audio were added.
    - Support for Bluetooth MIDI was added. This requires a
      wireplumber addition as well.
    - Reply OK to empty commands.
    - Improve compatibility with some devices that send stray \n
      such as the Sennheiser HD 350BT.
  * pulse-server
    - Devices with unsupported formats (by the pulseaudio API) are
      now also listed in the pulseaudio API (with invalid formats).
    - The native module-combine-stream is used for
      module-combine-sink.
  * JACK
    - Make jack.merge-monitor default to true to better match the
      jack1/2 behaviour. Add an exception for mixxx, which is more
      usable with unmerged monitors.
  * ALSA
    - The property handling in the ALSA plugin was improved.
      alsa.properties and alsa.rules can now be added to the config
      file.
    - A rule was added to tweak the buffer settings in
      Davinci Resolve so that it can run with acceptable latency.
    - ALSA volume will now also use cubic volumes, like pulseaudio.
    - The ALSA ctl plugin now also uses the client-rt.conf file.
    - A new alsa.volume-method was added to configure cubic or
      linear volume.
      This can be set per application using the rules.
  * GStreamer
    - pipewiresrc will now advertise DMABUF support if the pipeline
      supports this.
    - pipewiresrc will now always be a live source unless told
      otherwise.
- Drop reduce-meson-dependency.patch: openSUSE Leap 15.3 is
  no longer supported.
- Add patch to install module-combine-stream:
  * 0001-modules-also-install-module-combine-stream.patch
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-cpu-arm-Fix-incorrect-free.patch
  * 0001-alsa-guard-against-some-invalid-values.patch
  * 0001-spa-Fix-audioconvert-overflow-when-scaling.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 17 08:28:49 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to avoid division by 0 and other issues
  with invalid values (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2953):
  * 0001-alsa-guard-against-some-invalid-values.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix causing an overflow resulting in
  choppy sound in some cases (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2680):
  * 0001-spa-Fix-audioconvert-overflow-when-scaling.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Add patch from upstream to fix a crash on arm:
  * 0001-cpu-arm-Fix-incorrect-free.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 07:46:11 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.64:
  * Highlights
    - Clear old buffer memory on ports to fix some SIGBUS errors.
    - It is now possible to assign custom port names to the ports
      from an adapter. This feature is helpful to those who use a
      multichannel interface with long-term connections. This way
      they can label each port with its designation, such as an
      instrument name or anything else to be displayed in a
      patchbay or DAW.
    - Fix some issues with node suspend and quantum and rate
      calculations.
    - Fix some regressions in pulse-tunnel and RTP-source adaptive
      resampling that could cause synchronization problems.
    - UCM devices now also have a Pro Audio profile.
    - NODE_TARGET (with the object.id) is now deprecated, use
      TARGET_OBJECT (with the object.serial, which is not reused
      and can avoid races).
  * PipeWire
    - Clear all peer input port buffers when suspending. This fixes
      some SIGBUS errors when some plugins were using old memory.
      (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2914)
    - Fix a case where nodes that were not supposed to be
      suspended, were kept suspended on a rate change.
      (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2929)
    - Fix an error in the quantum and rate calculations that could
      cause nodes to run with wrong quantum and rates when multiple
      rates were allowed. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2925)
  * Tools
    - pw-dump will now sort dictionaries to make it easier to
      compare different outputs.
    - Improve output of pw-reserve.
    - pw-loopback uses TARGET_OBJECT so you will need to use the
      serial id (or better the name) as the target instead of the
      object id.
  * modules
    - The filter-chain modules has seen some cleanups, refactoring
      and optimizations in the various DSP functions.
    - The ROC module now supports setting a custom samplerate.
    - ROC 0.2.X is now required.
    - The pulse tunnel and RTP source were not updating the rate
      field correctly which could cause synchronization problems.
      (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2891)
    - The filter-chain now supports an arbitrary number of control
      properties. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2933)
    - It is now possible to assign custom port names to the ports
      from an adapter with the PW_KEY_NODE_CHANNELNAMES.
    - Support was added for capture and playback props in
      echo-cancel. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2939)
  * SPA
    - The ACP code now has an option to set the probe samplerate.
      (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#1599)
    - UCM devices now also have a Pro Audio profile.
    - Filtering of Step ranges is now implemented.
  * Pulse-Server
    - The channel-map is now set correctly on the echo-cancel
      module.
    - source_master and sink_master are now correctly handled in
      module echo-cancel.
    - Fix a regression in DRAIN where resuming after a DRAIN would
      fail. This caused problems for espeak.
      (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2928)
    - TARGET_OBJECT is now used to make it possible to use the
      indexes as a target.
    - ladspa-source and remap-source can now also link to monitors.
  * ALSA
    - The ALSA plugin now handles the target.object correctly when
      set to -1. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2893)
  * V4L2
    - The v4l2 replacement library now also follows symlinks.
    - Support for getting and setting controls was added.
    - Support for G_PARM was added.
    - The environment variable PIPEWIRE_V4L2_TARGET can be used to
      force an application onto a specific camera.
  * Bluetooth
    - Fix compilation without ldac_abr.
    - Fix a missing brace in CIND reply. This could cause some
      devices to fail.
    - Fix configuration of the initial latency.
  * GStreamer
    - The device provider now supports setting an fd so that it can
      connect to PipeWire sessions from the portal.
    - DMABuf support was re-enabled in gstpipewiresrc.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Remove patches from upstream

Thu Jan  5 20:07:10 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Disable ffmpeg support, only needed for pw-play and pw-record.
  Break a circular dependency with ffmpeg-5. Do this via disabling
  pkgconfig(libavcodec), pkgconfig(libavfilter) and
  pkgconfig(libavformat) BuildRequires as well as passing
  ffmpeg=disabled to meson.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  4 11:25:48 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

Thu Dec 15 17:37:52 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.63:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a critical bug that causes audio distortion in some cases
      when using AVX2.
    - Fix a crash in mpv caused by deinit of PipeWire.
    - Resample the convolver IR to match the graph samplerate for
      better results.
    - Many more small bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a segfault in the PipeWire deinit code triggered by mpv
      in some cases.
    - Fix docs about SPA_PLUGIN_DIR.
    - Always dlclose by default (even under valgrind). Add an
      option with PIPEWIRE_DLCLOSE to select alternative behaviour.
    - Improve PIPEWIRE_DEBUG category handling.
  * modules
    - Resample the IR for the convolver when the IR samplerate and
      graph rate don't match.
  * SPA
    - Handle spurious reads from timerfd gracefully.
    - Fix potential stack-use-after-scope when starting Audacity.
    - Fix distorted audio when using AVX2.
    - Remove fallback to default channel map in channelmix.
    - Improve sorting of MIDI events, use the same order as Ardour.
    - Enable LFE downmixing by default.
    - Make IEC958/AC3 and IEC958/DTS work better by enforcing a
      fixed minimal buffering for the encoder to avoid stuttering.
  * Pulse-Server
    - Add a new pulse.cmd config section to execute pulse commands,
      currently only for loading modules. This removes the
      dependency on pactl.
    - Improve debug of messages.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Add patch to add channel-map in the echo-cancel module:
  * 0001-pulse-server-add-channel-map-in-echo-cancel-module.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 10 14:04:50 UTC 2022 - Predrag Ivanović <predivan@mts.rs>

- Refresh reduce-meson-dependency.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  9 13:25:35 UTC 2022 - Predrag Ivanović <predivan@mts.rs>

- Update to version 0.3.62:
  * Highlights
    - A regression in screensharing was fixed. It was caused by a race when
      activating links and driver nodes.
    - Video transform metadata was added so that cameras and screen sharing
      can report the video orientation and transformations.
    - Support for the PulseAudio module-gsettings was added to make paprefs
      work.
    - Support for bluetooth offloading was added. This allows for the bluetooth
      reception, decoding and playback to happen completely in hardware.
      This also requires some support in WirePlumber.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.

  * PipeWire
    - More work on stopping nodes in a more controlled way.
    - Fix a race in starting nodes and drivers. In some cases the driver
      node would already be started while the link to the peer node was not
      ready yet. This caused regressions in screen sharing. The driver is
      now only started after all the followers and links completed.
    - Fix a case where a slow capture stream would not recycle buffers
      anymore and stall. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2874)
    - Fix a subtle bug in pw_loop_invoke that could cause callbacks to be
      delayed and cause crashes in some cases.
    - Fix a case where IPC was done from the data-thread and could cause
      crashes.

  * Tools
    - Silence some expected errors in the pw-top output.

  * modules
    - The filter-chain has seen some optimizations in the copy plugin and
      the convolver.
    - The zeroconf plugin will now only unpublish services from the server
      that was removed.
    - Fix a potential crash when stopping pw-loopback.
    - Some harmless errors were turned into info messages.
    - Fix some cases where pw_stream methods were called from the data-thread
      that could cause segfaults. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2633)

  * SPA
    - There is now a video transform metadata that indicates how a video
      frame was transformed (rotated/flipped). libcamera and the GStreamer
      elements now have support for this metadata.
    - The SPA volume plugin is now disabled from the default build.
    - Handle missing control info in libcamera.
    - Handle errors from loop better, don't call the callbacks on errors.
    - Somewhat improve performance in some audioconvert AVX2 code for format
      conversion.
    - Fix PortConfig and EnumPortConfig params in audioconvert and
      audioadapter to reflect what is actually going on instead of using
      hardcoded values.
    - Pass ignore-dB property correctly in all cases.
    - Probing is now done in 48KHz again. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2857)

  * Pulse-server
    - IPv4 addresses are now added first to the list and exposed first with
      zeroconf discover.
    - module-gsettings was added to make paprefs work.
    - The pulse.idle.timeout option was disabled by default and only enabled
       for selected apps (speech-dispatcher) because it caused some problems
       for other apps. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2880)

  * JACK
    - Only process valid ports. Could fix some crashes. (glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2863)

  * Bluetooth
    - Support was added for offloading bluetooth handling. Some hardware can
      receive, decode and play the bluetooth audio directly in hardware.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  4 15:48:22 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Drop dependency on SDL2; this leads to a build cycle with SDL2
  itself, and is only needed for pipewire example code anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 24 22:05:43 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.61:
  * Highlights
    - Fix a bug in audioadapter that could cause crashes when
      switching bluetooth profiles.
    - Fix sound in QEMU, deadbeef and openal again.
    - libcamera plugin fixes, dynamic add and remove should now
      work with the next wireplumber version.
    - Fix a regression in pw-midiplay where the first buffer would
      not play and some events would be missing.
    - The network module now doesn't export other network sources
      anymore.
    - pulse-server now detects clients that keep underrunning for a
      long time and will pause them to save power.
    - Many more bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Optimise away some useless graph recalculations.
    - Increase alternative sample rates from 16 to 32.
    - Silence some module loading errors when the error can be
      ignored.
    - Fix initial buffer requested size for pw-stream when
      operating in async mode. This also indirectly fixes the first
      buffer in pw-midiplay.
  * Modules
    - Set the network property on pulse-tunnel streams so that they
      are not exported anymore.
    - Filter-chain has optimized mix functions now.
  * SPA
    - Handle some errors in libcamera better.
    - Fix libcamera remove events. Fix the id allocation for
      devices.
    - Fix a bug in audioadapter where it would not renegotiate
      after a port reconfiguration, leading to crashes, especially
      when automatically switching profiles in bluetooth.
    - Do ALSA probing in 44100Hz again. Some devices seem to fail
      otherwise for some unknown reason.
    - Force playback start when the ALSA buffer is full. This fixes
      sound in QEMU.
    - Support Digital 5.1 AC3 for Asus Xonar SE.
    - Improve format renegotiation in audioadapter. This makes the
      ALSA plugin work again for deadbeef.
    - Fix latency reporting on adapter DSP ports.
  * pulse-server
    - Fix a bug where openal based applications would hang.
    - Improve zeroconf publish. Only publish on the address of the
      first running server. This avoids duplicate entries for IPv4
      and IPv6.
      Add support for republish entries when new servers are
      started.
    - Add a pulse.idle.timeout option (default to 5 seconds) to
      pause streams that have been underrunning for this amount of
      time. Badly behaving clients will then not keep the graph and
      device busy so that devices can be suspended to save battery.
      This should give better default behaviour with
      speech-dispatcher.
  * JACK
    - Add an option to configure the filter character.
    - Fix connect_callbacks. It was only called once for output

Thu Nov 10 16:07:42 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.60:
  * Highlights
    - The filter-chain now handles errors better and has fixes for
      many crasher bugs.
    - A new RTP module was added with a sender and receiver.
      It uses SAP to announce and consume RTP streams and is
      compatible with the PulseAudio RTP modules.
    - Many small bluetooth improvements and fixes.
    - The alsa plugin will now only start playback when there is
      data. This results in better synch and lower latency between
      capture and playback.
    - The v4l2 and libcamera plugins have seen a lot of
      improvements. They support control properties now. Also
      pw-v4l2 has seen many improvements and mostly passes the
      v4l2-compliance test now.
    - Many more bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Code cleanups, compiler warning fixes.
    - Add some extra checks to avoid scheduling an inactive node.
    - Rework the sequence of events to start and stop nodes.
    - Improve param enumeration.
    - An option was added to give priority to the Buffer params of
      the consumer. This makes it possible to use the default
      values of the consumer (instead of the producer) when
      capturing from a source.
    - The graph rate selection was improved to pick a rate closest
      to the requested one (instead of picking the default).
  * Modules
    - Fix some crashes in filter-chain.
    - X11 Bell module will now be loaded by default when available.
    - A new RTP module was added with a sender and receiver. It
      uses SAP to announce and consume RTP streams and is
      compatible with the PulseAudio RTP modules.
    - Improve RAOP compatibility.
    - The echo-cancel module now uses the resampler prefill option
      to align input and output samples without buffering. Better
      latency control when starting and stopping has been
      implemented.
    - The pulse tunnel will now write aligned samples to pulseaudio
      even when the ringbuffer wraps around. This fixes playback
      issues with multichannel sinks.
    - Add a delay option to module-loopback using a ringbuffer.
    - Implement echo-cancel params.
    - The filter-chain module has better error reporting.
    - The LADSPA search path was extended with some more common
      paths.
    - The echo-cancel input can now also be a monitor of a sink.
      This improves compatibility with some proton games that
      expect a real sink instead of a virtual one.
  * Tools
    - Better error reporting in pw-link.
    - pw-top now also shows IEC958 passthrough formats and
      JPEG/H264 video formats.
    - pw-top refreshes the screen faster.
    - pw-top now prints the state of the node and shows less info
      for inactive nodes.
    - pw-dump now uses the new seq field in the spa_param_info to
      discard old param updates and avoid duplicate params in the
      output.
  * Bluetooth
    - Add ModemManager support in the native backend.
    - Clean up GetManagedObjects handling.
    - Handle QoS from the endpoints in the codec.
    - Increase the socket buffer to have more control over the rate
      and QoS.
    - Simplify the packet flushing code.
    - Stop processing nodes before destroying them.
    - Fix timers when a source switches drivers.
    - Codecs can now share endpoints. This reduces the amount of
      endpoints and avoids problems with devices that can't handle
      a large amount of codec endpoints.
    - Report batery status to UPower for HFP AG.
    - Fix bitpool increase.
  * SPA
    - The audioresampler now avoids clicks and pops between
      activating and deactivating the adaptive resampler when used
      by the stream API.
    - Use default locale to parse float parameters.
    - The upmix functions now have SSE optimisations.
    - Avoid recalculating the complete channelmix setup when only
      the volume changes.
    - The alsa plugin will now only start playback when there is
      data. This results in better synch and lower latency between
      capture and playback.
    - The ALSA MIDI sequencer will now pull data from the graph
      even when it did not output anything. Fixes some graph stalls
      with the sequencer in some cases.
    - v4l2 and libcamera sources now recycle buffers when nothing
      is consuming them. This avoids stalling the graph.
    - libcamera now suggests a more appropriate frame size than the
      smallest poster frame.
    - Improve state changes in audioconvert.
    - A new seq field was added to spa_param_info to keep track of
      pending param updates.
    - Support speaker output only on RealTek ALC4080.
    - The v4l2 source now supports setting controls.
    - The libcamera plugin now supports enumerating and setting
      controls.
    - A new unit test for 6.1 channel mapping was added.
      More debug info was added to audioconvert for the channel
      matrix.
    - Audioconvert will now also upmix a rear-center channel when
      needed.
  * pulse-server
    - Add support for the RTP send and recv modules with the new
      native RTP module.
    - Add option to set latency for pulse-tunnel streams and
      module-zeroconf-discover.
    - The socket will now be given the same permissions as what
      pulseaudio did (0777).
    - Implement module-loopback latency_msec correctly with the new
      delay parameter.
    - sysfs.path is now filled with the same data as pulseaudio.
    - The manager now uses the new seq field in the spa_param_info.
    - Fix a bug where in some cases the read pointer would get out
      of synch and cause too large requests.
  * ALSA
    - The alsa plugin now reuses the stream in prepare which
      results in better performance.
    - Some deadlocks have been fixed in the ALSA plugin.
    - The ALSA plugin reports more accurate timing information in
      some cases.
  * V4l2
    - The v4l2 compatibility layer has received a lot of updates.
    - Improved node names and format enumeration.
    - Support for multiple /dev/videoX devices, each mapped to a
      unique PipeWire node.
    - Passes the v4l2-compliance test now with both the v4l2 and
      libcamera backend in PipeWire.
    - Improved mmap support for inline buffer memory.
      This makes it possible to consume PipeWire streams.
    - Negotiation works more reliably now.
  * JACK
    - Implement jack_acquire_real_time_scheduling() and
      jack_drop_real_time_scheduling() by keeping the thread utils
      in a global state.
    - Fix jack_client_thread_id() to return NULL when the client is
      not active, just like jack1 and jack2.
    - An option was added to let the jack_set_buffer_size()
      function update the global metadata. A quirk was added so
      that jack_bufsize uses this new feature to make the buffer
      size settings persistent and global, just like jack.
    - jack_port_register() and jack_port_unregister() can be called
      on an active client so make this thread safe.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-filter-chain-iterate-the-port-correctly.patch
  * 0002-spa-support-the-speakers-output-only-case-in-report_.patch
- Add patch to make Telegram playback work again:
  * 0001-pulse-server-also-advance-read-pointer-in-underrun.patch

      suspend and rate switch.
    - module-filter-chain can now adapt to the graph samplerate.
    - Fix some potential stuttering and crackling in pulse-server.
    - Add Bluetooth LE support. This requires experimental kernel
      and bluez support.
    - The ALSA plugin has more options to control the buffer size.
      This can be used to work around high latency in
      davinci resolve.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Add audio capture example with volume meter.
    - Fix a case where a rate switch would not suspend all the

      history with 0 so that we don't have smaller buffers at the
      start.
    - Make sure that when an overflow corrupts a POD, that it will
      always stay corrupted.
    - Rate limit some ALSA warnings and reduce some unwanted
      warnings.
    - Don't recalculate the audioconverter state for each

    - Increase max number of periods.
    - The parameters handling was improved. There is now an option
      to set the buffer-bytes of the ALSA plugin.
    - PIPEWIRE_ALSA can now be used as an environment variable to
      restrict the plugin formats and buffer size.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      and streams.
    - Fix some potential crashes when starting streams.
    - The ALSA plugin has had improved timing reporting and poll
      descriptor handling that should improve compatibility.
    - Many more improvements and bugfixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Avoid scheduling nodes before they are added to the graph.
      This could avoid some crashes when scheduling nodes that
      were not completely started yet. (#2677)
  * Tools
    - pw-top now also shows the negotiated formats of streams and
      devices. (#2566)
    - pw-top prints microseconds as "us" now to avoid unicode
      problems.
  * Modules
    - Fix compilation with newer lv2.
    - Fix setting realtime priority with RTKit, it was not setting
      rlimit correctly and RTKit would refuse to change the
      priority.
    - Fix some playback problems with RAOP sink. (#2673)
    - Filter chain will now warn when a non-existing control
      property is used in the config file. (#2685)
    - Filter chain can now handle control port names with ":"
      in the name. (#2685)
    - The echo-cancel module and interface now has
      activate/deactivate functions to make it possible for plugins
      to reset their state.
  * SPA
    - Make sure audioconvert uses the given channelmap and channels
      for the volumes, even when not negotiated yet. This makes it
      possible to change the volume before the node has been
      negotiated.
    - Refactor the peaks resampler. Fix an error in the SSE code.

      the correct PID/TID mappings to make realtime also work from
      flatpaks.
    - Fix rate adjustement logic in pulse-tunnel. This would cause
      increasing delays and hickups when using tunnels.
    - Add OPUS as a new vendor codec. Add OPUS-A2DP spec.
      PipeWire can now send and reveive OPUS data over bluetooth.
    - An AAC decoder was added so that PipeWire can now also
      function as an A2DP AAC receiver.
    - Fix some issues where the wrong samplerate was used.
    - Fix rate match for sources. This fixes an error where

    - Improve ALSA format negotiation. If the ALSA node is not
      running and there was a previously configured format, close
      and reopen the device to enumerate and accept all possible
      formats again.
  * ALSA
    - The alsa plugin will now also save the volumes set with the
      control API. This saves the volumes set with alsa-mixer, for

Tue Jul 19 14:00:39 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.56:
  * Highlights
    - A critical bug that could crash JACK applications was fixed.
    - Some more regressions in audiomixer were fixed. This should
      fix crackling and stuttering in some cases as well as some
      channel mapping regressions.
    - A bug in the alsa plugin was fixed that could cause
      stuttering in VMs.
    - Bluetooth sources should have improved latency and rate
      control.
    - Many more bugfixes and improvements.
  * Modules
    - An experimental AVB module was added. It can expose PipeWire
      as an AVB entity and initiate (broken) streaming between
      entities.
    - module-loopback now handles the cases where the input and
      output channels are different without crashing or producing
      silence.
    - The filter-chain module now correctly calculates the output
      size without crashing in some cases. It also skips invalid
      ports instead of crashing.
    - Handle and report pthread errors better.
  * SPA
    - The resampler qualities were tweaked a little.
    - A bug that would sometimes cut off the last part of a buffer
      was fixed in the alsa plugin. This could cause broken audio
      in VMs.
    - Access to the alsa mixer and devices is now checked more
      thoroughly.
    - The spa-resample tool can now also handle large downsampling
      rates without crashing.
    - Audioconverter now uses rounding for float to int
      conversions, which reduces distortions. Compilation of the C
      subroutines was separated and uses its own optimisation flags
      now.
    - Noise shaping was improved in audioconvert. A new Wannamaker
      3 tap shaper was added.
    - Audioconvert now uses a pattern for generating keep alive
      noise. This should have much less energy and be even more
      inaudible.
    - A channel mapping bug was fixed in audioconvert.
    - The dsp audio mixer would sometimes not mix enough and cause
      dropouts.
  * JACK
    - A critical bug in the mixer was fixed. It would cause most
      JACK applications to segfault at start-up.
  * Bluetooth
    - A new rate control algorithm was implemented for the sources.
    - The media role on HSP/HFP streams is now fixed.
  * Pulse Server
    - Add the resampler delay to delay reporting as well.

      snippets that can be dropped in .conf.d/ directories, such as
      the filter-chain.conf.d/ one.
    - Start suggesting to use target.object instead of node.target
      in docs and examples.
  * SPA
    - Use the cosh window again for the resampler. It should now
      give better resampler quality.
    - Rework the mixer functions. They were rewritten for higher
      precision and better performance. Add unit tests and
      benchmarks.
    - Improve format conversion for 32bits for avoid errors in
      clang because of undefined behaviour at extreme ranges.
    - Fix a bug in audioconvert where it would not consume the
      right amount of samples when the resampler was disabled.
      This could cause skipping and hickups.
    - Fix bug in audioconvert where it would try to convert the
      input samples multiple times, causing strange artefacts when
      upmixing.
    - Be more strict about valid JSON floats.
    - device.vendor.id and device.product.id should now always show
      up in 0xXXXX format and should not be converted to floats in
      pw-dump anymore.
    - Add triangular dither, add unit tests for noise generation,
      add some more optimisations.
  * Bluetooth
    - HFP and A2DP now expose different routes and thus can have
      different volumes.
    - HW Volumes for HFP are now synchronised better.
      Volume changes from HW buttons are now also saved.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Add 0001-jack-only-mix-when-we-have-input-to-mix.patch: Fix an
  Ardour start-up crash.

Thu Jul  7 08:50:16 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.54:
  * Highlights
    - Some critical bugs in the new audioconvert were fixed. The
      old adapter had internal buffering that was abused in some
      places.
    - The bluetooth sources were rewritten using a ringbuffer to
      make them more reliable to jitter and remove old audioconvert
      behaviour.
    - Many improvements to the audio converter.
    - Native DSD128 and up is now supported by pw-dsdplay.
  * tools
    - Support DSD128 to DSD512 as well by scaling the amount of
      samples to read per time slice.
  * SPA
    - Format conversion is now generated with macros to remove
      duplication of code.
    - 24bits conversions were rewritten to use the generic
      conversion functions.
    - Temporary buffers in audioconvert are now made large enough
      in all cases.
    - Fix draining in audioconvert. This fixes speaker-test.
    - Fix the channel remapping.
    - Audio conversion constants were tweaked to handle the maximum
      ranges and provide lossless conversion between 24bits and
      floats.
    - Vector code and C code are aligned and the unit tests are
      activated again. A new lossless conversion test was added.
    - Fix an underrun case where the adapter would not ask for more
      data.
    - Fix PROP_INFO for audioconvert.
    - Use the blackman window again for the resampler, the cosh
      window has some bugs that can cause distortion in some cases.
    - Add more unit tests for audioconvert. Add end-to-end
      conversion tests.
    - Don't leak memory in format converter.
  * pulse-server
    - Card properties are now also added to sinks and sources,
      just like in pulseaudio.
    - Increase the maxlength size to at least 4 times the fragsize
      to avoid xruns.
    - Fix a race when setting default devices.
  * Bluetooth
    - The source was rewritten to use a ringbuffer. This avoids
      regressions caused by audioconvert. 
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-audioconvert-ensure-temp-buffers-are-large-enough.patch
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  1 14:25:49 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Add a patch from upstream to fix segmentation faults in MPV:
  * 0001-audioconvert-ensure-temp-buffers-are-large-enough.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 10:40:53 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.53:
  * Highlights
    - The 44.1KHz samplerate was removed again from the defaults,
      it caused all kinds of problems with various hardware.
    - The ALSA plugin should now be able to deal with unsupported
      samplerates and fall back to the nearest supported one.
    - The audioconvert plugin was rewritten to be more maintainable
      and quicker. It also gained support for control ports and
      dithering with optional noise shaping.
    - An impossible buffering situation is avoided in pulse-server
      that would cause some applications (sunshine, ...) to
      stutter.
  * PipeWire
    - 44.1KHz was removed from the allowed rates again. It caused
      all kinds of regressions due to driver bugs and timing issues
      on HDMI.
  * modules
    - filter-chain now does some more error checking and reporting
      to avoid some crashes.
    - filter-chain now supports more channel layouts for input and
      output that does not need to match the plugin layout.
    - Format parsing is now more consistent in the modules.
  * Tools
    - pw-cli can now also work without readline support.
    - pw-cat can now also read multichannel ulaw/alaw/u8/s8.
  * SPA
    - The audioconvert plugin was rewritten. This should make it
      more maintainable. It also fixed some issues such as CPU
      spikes in some cases and crashes in others. The old plugins
      were removed, for a code reduction of some 6000 lines.
    - The audioconvert plugin now supports control ports, which can
      be enabled on nodes in the session manager. This makes it
      possible to control audioconvert properties using timed
      events or midi.
    - NoteOn 0-velocity MIDI events are no longer filtered out.
      This is a valid event, nodes that can't deal with it should
      fix it up themselves. The JACK layer still filters out these
      events by default but this can now be configured with a
      per-client property.
    - The running status on midi events is now disabled to match
      what JACK does.
    - The ALSA plugin will now deal with driver bugs when a driver
      announces support for a samplerate but then refuses to use it
      later.
    - The ALSA plugin has been optimized a little for sample IO.
    - V4L2 now doesn't error when there are no controls.
    - Error handling was improved in the audio converter.
    - The audioconvert plugin now supports rectangular dithering
      and noise shaping.
    - The audioconvert plugin can now insert additional inaudible
      noise that can be used to keep some amplifiers alive.
    - The audioconvert format conversion was changed so that it now
      produces the full 32 bits range in the C fallback conversion
      code as well.
    - The resampler window function was changed to a cosh() window
      function.
    - Vendor and device id are now in hex.
  * pulse-server
    - Tweak the record buffer attributes some more and make sure
      we don't end up in impossible buffering situations.
      Fixes an issue with distorted sound in sunshine.
    - Fix a potential crash when updating the client property list.
    - Some properties on cards were aligned with pulseaudio.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-settings-remove-44.1KHz-from-allowed-rates-again.patch
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 17:47:19 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to remove 44.1kHz from allowed rates. 
  This reverts the new behaviour in 0.3.52 which is causing
  problems to too many people (boo#1200760):
  * 0001-settings-remove-44.1KHz-from-allowed-rates-again.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  9 15:02:18 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.52:
  * Highlights
    - Add 44.1KHz to allowed samplerates. The server can now switch
      by default between 48KHz and 44.1KHz.
    - Streams now allocate less resources.
    - Fix some bugs that could make the server crash.
    - Bluetooth now supports the LC3plus vendor codec.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Add 44.1KHz to allowed samplerates.
    - Avoid setting the locale.
    - Avoid use-after-free when destroying a node from
      spa-node-factory.
    - Avoid using reallocarray when not available.
    - Set port alias is not otherwise set.
  * Modules
    - Improve filter-chain parsing and error reporting. Handle
      empty nodes.
    - Handle destroy of globals and factory in most modules.
    - Add refcounts to client and resources to handle destroy of
      the protocol.
    - Handle global node.name in filter-chain and loopback again,
      use it to construct unique stream names.
    - Avoid a wrapped pw-node in the adapter. This reduces
      resources allocated for streams.
    - Fix a crash when module-x11-bell was unloaded.
    - Add a new module-pipe-tunnel that can write/read data from a
      UNIX pipe.
  * Tools
    - Fix DSD playback again in pw-cat.
    - Add -n option to pw-loopback to set node names.
    - Add -P option to pw-cat to pass properties to the stream.
    - Support stdin/stdout in pw-cat.
    - pw-dump now also dumps object removal when monitoring
  * SPA
    - Avoid duplicate param results in pw-dump for ports.
    - Avoid endless loops in audioconvert for badly behaving
      clients.
   - Scale max-error in alsa based on quantum and avoid logging a
     warning when starting.
   - Improve debug of failed format conversion.
   - Handle offset in the audio dsp mixer inputs and clamp to the
     maximum buffer size.
   - Add option to disable locale support for JSON number
     conversion.
   - Add support for Astro A20 Gen2.
   - Fix some of the test sources, the flags were not set
     correctly.
   - Add camera location as property in libcamera and let the
     session manager generate a localised description.
   - Fix some crashes due to wrong vargar types in v4l2 controls.
   - Improve ALSA resync behaviour.
   - Add support for Komplete Audio 6 MK2.
   - Improve loop cancel while iterating.
   - Try not to mix surround channels and AUX channels. Make card
     with many ports look better when not using the Pro Audio
     profile.
   - Vulkan filters were added.
  * Bluetooth
   - Add LC3plus vendor codec.
   - Handle unsupported indicators better.
   - Ensure multiple devices on an adapter use different codecs
     because one endpoint can only be used by one device at a time.
   - Fix bitpool control as a follower.
   - Handle bluetooth errors better.
   - Speed up bluetooth connection by only waiting for the profiles
     supported by the adapter.
   - The dummy AVRCP player is disabled by default because it seems
     to break more devices than it fixes.
  * pulse-server
    - Add initial stream latency property so that devices can be
      started with a resonably accurate latency.
    - Fix ringbuffer underrun case.
    - module-native-protocol-tcp now has a auth-anonymous option to
      give full access to the clients.
    - Report a node as being moved when it is still moving. This
      improves compatibility with pasystray.
    - Avoid overallocating message memory.
    - Don't export NETWORK nodes in zeroconf.
    - Fix stride for TrueHD and DTSHD passthrough.
    - Make sure we don't send too small audio fragments. Fixes

    - Rework module handling some more.
    - Use the new native module-pipe-tunnel for pipe-sink and
      pipe-source.
    - Implement the STREAM_MOVED message when a stream got moved.
    - Fix a potential segfault when stopping the server and a TCP
      module as still loaded.
  * ALSA
    - Add support for updating sw_params at runtime, mostly the
      min-avail param.
    - Capture and playback nodes are now assumed to use a different
      clock and will activate the adaptive resampler when linked.
      This assumption is removed in Pro Audio mode. This provide a
      better experience out of the box with most devices.
  * JACK
    - Fix setting properties with PIPEWIRE_PROPS again.
    - Don't use 64 bits atomic operations for sync_timeout.
    - Cleanup in error cases was improved, avoiding some crashes.
  * GStreamer
    - Fix pipewiresink in mode=provide.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 23:13:59 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.51:
  * Highlights
    - Improve graph reconfiguration.
    - Extra configuration options for streams and filters with
      config rules and environment variable.
    - Improve module-pulse-tunnel latency, stability and error
      recovery.
    - pw-top, pw-cli and pw-link improvements.
    - Fix a channelmixer upmixing clipping issue.
    - The ROC module has seen many improvements.
    - Many more bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - The graph reconfiguration code was reworked:
      * Moved nodes will update the new driver quantum correctly.
      * Inactive nodes are ignored more.
      * Nodes that require a driver are now not scheduled anymore
        when they are passive (unused).
      * Improved performance, the graph is reconfigured with a
        minimal amount of changes.
    - Method and event argument names were improved.
    - A linker garbage collection problem was fixed.
    - Properties on threads are now implemented. Use common code to
      set thread name and add an option to set stack-size.
    - Streams and filters always want a driver now. This makes it
      possible to just link a playback stream to a capture stream
      without a driver and have it work.
    - Streams and filters can now also have rules in the config
      file.
    - Streams, filters, JACK, ALSA and v4l2 now support
      PIPEWIRE_PROPS environment variable to override node
      properties.
    - Add config section extensions. This provides a way for modules
      to have specific config to override the default config.
    - Handle realloc errors better.
    - Improve stream and filter property updates.
  * Modules
    - The pulse-tunnel modules has improved latency management and
      should now work a lot better.
    - Module-loopback, module-echo-cancel, module-filter-chain
      unload the module when a stream is destroyed.
    - Biquads in filter-chain now can have more gain (5->20 dB).
    - Filter-chain now has a builtin delay line filter.
    - Filter-chain can now parse the config key correctly in all
      cases.
    - The ROC sink and source saw many improvements. roc-source is
      now a stream by default that connects to the default sink.
      Both modules will try to set a graph rate. Both modules have
      an option to select the FEC mode.
      The ROC source has lower latency now.
    - Handle realloc errors better.
  * tools
    - pw-cat does not have --list-targets anymore, use one of the
      more advanced and less buggy tools such as wpctl or pw-cli to
      list sinks and sources.
    - pw-top has seen many improvements.
      * It now has some timeouts to reset the node values to their
        default state when unused.
      * The man page was improved.
      * Invalid timings and errors are displayed in a better way.
    - pw-cli and pw-link can now create links between all ports of
      given nodes.
    - pw-cat can now save to other file formats than wav, based on
      the extension of the filename.
  * SPA
    - The resampler now uses a different internal method for
      draining. It can now also handle 0 size buffers as input
      without draining.
    - The channelmixer now uses the front channel averages for FC
      and LFE.
    This avoids clipping and results in much better upmixing.
    - ALSA should now work again on 32 bits. (#2271)
    - The JSON parser now converts escaped unicode correctly to UTF8.
  * bluetooth
    - Codec switch improvements when the device is disconnected.
  * pulse-server
    - There is a new module-roc-sink-input module, the PulseAudio
      equivalent.
    - The ROC source and sink-input module now have a much lower
      latency.
    - The ROC module now has an option to select FEC mode.
    - Playback and record rate adjustements should work now.
  * JACK
    - Remove some useless pthread attributes. This makes JACK work
      in QEMU with sandboxing enabled.
    - The buffer_size callback is now only called when something has
      changed since the last process() callback or get_buffer_size()
      method. This fixes a GStreamer issue and is more in line with
      what JACK does.
    - Fix a potential deadlock when the process thread is doing IPC
      and the IPC thread is blocking on the data thread.
    - Allocation errors in metadata are handled better.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 14 11:26:22 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.50:
  * Highlights
    - pw-stream can now report more timing information and can
      suggest the optimal number of samples to queue for playback.
    - pw-dot now works again.
    - module-pulse-tunnel latency was improved.
    - Wine applications using the JACK backend should no longer
      crash.
    - The channelmixer defaults are improved and the muffled sound
      when playing back 5.1 and 7.1 material has been fixed.
    - Many fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - pw-stream now places a suggested amount of samples in the
      pw-buffer for playback. This allows you to remove some places
      where spa_io_rate_match was needed to get this information.
    - pw-stream has new API to request a timing update. New fields
      are added in the timing info, such as number of buffered
      samples in the resampler and the number of queued and
      dequeued buffers.
    - pw-stream has support for double controls now. More controls
      are exposed such as the Rate control to do adaptive
      resampling.
    - The thread-utils object was moved to the context to avoid
      some concurrent use cases that caused crashes.
    - Deactivating an exported node/stream will now remove the node
      from the data-thread immediately so that the process function
      will not be called anymore and resources can be safely freed.
      This could fix some of the last remaining crashes when
      streams are stopped.
    - PipeWire will now fail to load a module that tries to
      register the same export type twice instead of silently doing
      the wrong thing.
  * Modules
    - Many modules now use the NODE_WANT_DRIVER instead of the
      pipewire.dummy NODE_GROUP property. This makes it possible to
      use them with any other driver and can avoid resampling in
      some cases.
    - module-pulse-tunnel now uses an adaptive resampler to keep
      the latency under control. Latency should be much better than
      before and stay constant even when there are network delays.
    - There is now an option for packages to disable building the
      RTKit module, which is still built by default for backwards
      compatibility reasons.
    - A leak was fixed in filter-chain.
    - Module node names are now made more unique with the pid.
  * tools
    - pw-cat verbose output has been improved.
    - pw-link now has a man page.
    - pw-reserve now has an -r option to make it issue a
      RequestRelease command on the owner of the device. This makes
      it possible to ask WirePlumber to close and release a device.
    - Fix pw-dot again. It didn't work anymore because of stray
      done events that were emitted to notify the client of object
      serials.
  * SPA
    - The channelmixer now has PSD upmixing enabled again. We used
      the simple upmixing in the previous release but that just
      sounds too awful to be a good default.
    - The channelmixer will not upmix FC and LFE anymore when
      upmixing is explicitly disabled.
    - The channelmixer will only lowpass filter FC and LFE channels
      when they were upmixed.
    - The defaults of the channelmixer were tweaked a little. There
      is now a little bit more bass in the LFE channel and more
      high fequencies in the FC channel when upmixing. Also the
      channel widening has been disabled by default.
    - Locale independent float parsing now uses a more portable
      solution with uselocale.
    - ALSA will now only allocate a buffer size big enough to hold
      4 times the quantum limit instead of as large as possible.
  * pulse-server
    - Internal cleanups in handling of modules.
    - A quirk to force s16 sample formats for teams-insider has
      been added.
  * JACK
    - The data-loop is now started in activate and stopped in
      deactivate.
      This makes the data-loop respect any custom thread functions
      you configure. This also makes Wine apps using the JACK
      backend work.
    - Port sorting was improved/fixed.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Require RealtimeKit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 15:09:49 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Reorder BuildRequires and space conditions a bit better in the
  spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 07:56:08 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.49:
  * Highlights
    - Sample rate switching should work again.
    - pw-dot can now use the output of pw-dump to render a graph.
    - Bluetooth A2DP streaming was improved that would reduce
      stuttering on some devices.
    - A JACK bug was fixed that would sometimes make it impossible
      to add more tracks in Ardour. (#1714)
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a potential crash when NULL params were configured.
    - Add some simple functional tests to avoid some recent
      regressions. Improve the test framework for this as well.
    - Improvements to the poll loop to avoid some use-after-free
      scenarios.
    - Fix samplerate switching again.
    - setlocale is not called anymore from the pipewire library.
      This should be called by the application. (#2223)
    - pw_init() and pw_deinit() can now be nested and called
      multiple times.
    - pw_stream will now report the resampler delay in the
      pw_time.queued field.
  * modules
    - module-filter-chain now supports arbitrary many properties
      and will use property hints to assign them the right type.
    - The ROC modules now accept a sink/source_properties
      parameter.
    - The module-rt can now also be built without RT-Kit support.
    - module-echo-cancel can now use a fraction to specify the
      delay for more precise control.
  * SPA
    - The channelmixer will now do upmixing by default and will not
      use normalization. It will also use a simple upmixing
      algorithm that duplicates channels by default. A more
      interesting upmix method is also available (PSD) but needs to
      be enabled manually. (#861)
    - Add SSE optimized (de)interleave functions for 32 bits
      samples with and without byteswap.
    - JSON parsing of empty strings will now give an invalid number
      instead of 0.
    - JSON numbers are now parsed and serialized in a locale
      independent way so that , and . are not mixed up.
    - The resampler will now report the resample delay and queued
      samples as the extra delay.
  * tools
    - pw-cat will read more dsf files correctly and will not crash
      at the end.
    - pw-top now has a man page.
    - pw-dot can now use the output of pw-dump to render a graph.
  * bluetooth
    - Improve interactions with oFono.
    - Fix recovery with slow connections.
    - Improve frame size of AptX-ll.
    - A2DP can now use any quantum and will flush packets in
      smaller chunks when needed to adapt. This improves stuttering
      in some cases.
  * pulse-server
    - The server configuration can now be placed in
      pulse.properties section, which also makes it possible to
      have custom overrides.
    - Implement FIX_ flags for capture as well.
    - Small fixes and improvements in module loading.
  * JACK
    - Clear the last error before executing a new action or else we
      could end up with error from a previous action. This causes
      some problems in Ardour where adding a track would fail after
      some time. (#1714) 
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 11:10:53 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.48:
  * Highlights
    - Fix IEC958 passthrough again.
    - Fix pulse-server crashes when playing a sample.
    - Support for more a more advanced upmixing algorithm.
    - filter-chain now supports arbitrary many ports.
    - Fix multichannel support in WINE (with new WirePlumber).
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - The work queue is now created in the context so we can fail
      early and avoid further error checking in various places.
    - Fix a potential use after free with threaded loops.
    - The protocol now has a message footer. This is used to pass
      around global state such as the last registered object
      serial number. This can be used to detect when a client tries
      to bind to old (but reused) object ids. This avoids some
      races in the session manager but also when binding objects.
    - The zero-denormals CPU flag is now not touched anymore unless
      explicitly selected by the user. Denormals are avoided in
      filter-chain now in software. If the zero-denormals are now
      only configured in the data thread. This should fix issues
      with luajit.
    - Configuration parsing will not actually fail on errors.
    - pw-top now correctly clips unicode characters.
    - Many places now use a dynamic POD builder to support
      arbitrary large property sets.
    - pw-stream now support PropInfo parameters so that they can
      announce custom properties.
    - Serial number are now also set on metadata and
      session-manager objects.
  * SPA
    - audioadapter is now smarter when trying to fixate the format.
      It will use the PortConfig format to fill in any wildcards.
      This results in the least amount of conversions when the
      stream can handle it. It also is part of a fix (also requires
      a session manager fix) for WINE multichannel support.
    - Fix 5.1 to 2 channels mixing. It was using the volume of the
      stereo pair on all channels.
    - Fix some weird volume issues when a source is capturing and
      channelmixing.
    - Add stereo to 7.1 upmixing.
    - The channelmix parameters can be changed at runtime now.
    - Many improvements to the upmixing algorithms. Rear channels
      are now constructed from the ambient sound and can have delay
      and phase shift applied to them to improve spacialisation.
      The stereo channels can be filtered so that the dialogue is
      more concentrated in the centre channel.
  * modules
    - Module X11 bell received cleanups and improvements.
    - The module now has a private method to schedule unload later.
      This simplifies cleanup in many modules.
    - module-filter-chain now handles arbitrary many ports and
      control ports.
    - Fix a bug in RAOP where it was reading from the wrong port.
  * pulse-server
    - Nodes with the DONT_MOVE property should fail with -EINVAL
      when they are moved.
    - Fix a segfault when playing a sample.
    - The _FIX flags in pulse-server also now ignore the configured
      sample format, just like pulseaudio does.
    - Fix IEC958 passthrough again. It got accidentally broken
      since 0.3.45 with a fix for another issue.
    - Fix module-null-sink device.description.
  * Bluetooth
    - Don't try to connect HSP/HFP when no backend is available.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-revert-loop-remove-destroy-list.patch
  * 0002-pulse-server-free-pending-sample-reply.patch
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.
- Enable pulseaudio-setup use on openSUSE Leap 15.4.
- Some spec clean-up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 12:24:26 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Add 0001-revert-loop-remove-destroy-list.patch: fix MPD crash.
- Add 0002-pulse-server-free-pending-sample-reply.patch: fix
  "fast volume change".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 14:06:20 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.47:
  * Fix a bug in pulse-server that caused cached notifications to
    play multiple times.
  * Remove a check and warnings to catch leaked listeners on the
    proxy. This might access invalid memory and cause infinite
    loops in older wireplumber.
- Rebase reduce-meson-dependency.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 17 10:42:44 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.46:
  * Highlights:
    - Fix a critical bug in pipewire-pulse buffer size handling
      that made some apps (MuseScore, ... ) stutter.
    - Fix a critical bug where devices would not show when the
      kernel was compiled without VERBOSE_PROCSFS.
    - JACK clients will now use lock-quantum by default. This
      makes sure that all dynamic quantum changes are disabled
      while a JACK app is running. The only way to force a
      quantum chance is through a JACK app or with the metadata.
    - Almost all limits on number of ports, clients and nodes are
      removed.
    - A Dummy fallback sink is now automatically created when
      there are no other sinks. This avoids stalling browsers.
    - Sound sharing with Zoom should work better. A new WirePlumber
      release might be required.
    - Many more fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Update docs with new config overrides.
    - The rule matching logic was moved to config and code is now
      shared with pulse-server and JACK.
    - Add new Romanian translation.
    - When a quantum is forced with metadata, any node that asked
      to lock-quantum is ignored so that the quantum change can
      happen.
    - Fix a bug where a mixer was removed twice, leading to
      potential memory corruption.
    - The port limits on nodes and filters are now removed.
      Some code was simplified.
    - Fix a potential leak because listeners where removed while
      they could be emitted.
    - Improve context.exec and avoid zombie processes.
  * Modules
    - The RAOP module now has a default latency of 2 seconds,
      like PulseAudio.
    - The echo-cancel module now uses the plugin loader to load
      the backends. This makes it possible to add custom, out of
      tree, echo cancel plugins.
  * Tools
    - Improve help of pw-link.
    - Output to stdout and error to stderr. Use setlinebuf for
      stdout to improve piping between apps. (#2110)
  * SPA
    - Improve removing sources when dispatching. Also improve
      performance now that a destroy loop can be removed. (#2114)
    - Fix an fd leak in the logger when logging to a file.
    - Improve loop enter/leave checks and support recursive loops.
  * pulse-server
    - Clamp various buffer attributes to the max length. Fixes some
      issues with various applications. (#2100)
    - Module properties are now remapped correctly from their
      pulseaudio variant to the PipeWire ones.
    - Fix module index in introspect. Use the right index when
      loaded from our internal modules. (#2101)
    - Improve argument parsing and node.description. (#2086)
    - The sink-index should now be filled in correctly when playing
      a sample. (#2129)
    - module-always-sink is now implemented and loaded by default.
      (#1838)
    - Add support for loading some modules only once.
    - Module load and unload now does extra sync to make it appear
      synchronous, like in PulseAudio. This improves sounds sharing
      in Zoom.
  * ALSA
    - Fix critical bug where alsa devices would not show when the
      kernel was compiled without VERBOSE_PROCFS.
    - Some corner cases were fixed in the ALSA timing code. When
      the capture node is follower, it will now not try to read too
      much data and xrun but it will instead produce a cycle of
      silence.
    - Various fixes and improvements to make ALSA devices resync to
      the driver more quickly and accurately.
  * JACK
    - Add an option to name the default device as system to improve
      compatibility with some applications,
    - Use lock-quantum by default. This makes sure that all dynamic
      quantum changes are disabled while a JACK app is running. The
      only way to force a quantum chance is through a JACK app or
      with the metadata.
    - It is now possible to do IPC calls from the data thread. Note
      that this is a very bad idea but required for compatibility
      with JACK2.
  * GStreamer
    - GStreamer sink will now set a default channelmap to make it
      possible to remap to the channel layout of the device.
- Update patch for further uses of "new" meson features used by
  upstream:
  * reduce-meson-dependency.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 15 09:47:31 UTC 2022 - Alois Wohlschlager <alois1@gmx-topmail.de>

- Run ldconfig for pipewire-libjack-0_3
  * The JACK libraries are made available system-wide using
    /etc/ld.so.conf.d. Hence, ldconfig should be run to make sure
    the dynamic linker picks them up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  3 11:56:13 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.45:
  * Highlights
    - Zoom, telegram and other apps should be able to play sound
      again.
    - Implement a better way to force and lock JACK buffersize.
    - Default sink and source names and properties are improved.
    - The config loader can now load and merge fragments in conf.d
      directories for easier user configuration of config files.
    - Many small bug fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - pw-cli can now also send Commands to nodes. This can be used
      to Suspend a device, for example.
    - The eventfd was removed from loops and invoke is now used to
      stop the loop, this saves an fd.
    - New Alpine CI target to test musl builds, various build
      fixes.
    - Add force-quantum and force-rate properties.
    - The config loader can now load and merge fragments in conf.d
      directories. (#207)
    - resource error methods can be called without a resource and
      then just log an error message.
    - link-factory can now also work from the config. (#2095)
  * modules
    - module-simple-protocol has better argument parsing and can
      handle channelmap now. (#2068) It's also possible to
      configure latency and rate.
    - The native protocol now does extra checks for invalid data.
      (#2070)
  * ALSA
    - TI2902 chips as found in various Behringer cards should have
      inputs again.
    - Better handling of busy devices in udev, retry when the
      inotify close event is emited.
  * SPA
    - plugins now handle alignment properly and only expect the max
      alignment required for the CPU. (#2074)
  * Bluetooth
    - SBC-XQ is now enabled for the JBL Endurance RUN BT headset.
    - Support for non-hexadecimal XAPL version strings to improve
      compatibility.
    - Use HCI commands again to probe the adapter msbc capability.
      This improves compatibility with some adapters. (#2030)
    - Set the right startup volume.
    - Better A2DP source idle handling.
    - Fix a timer bug in SCO sink that could cause busy looping.
  * pulse-server
    - A playback issue when the tlength > maxlength was fixed.
      (#2069) This affected Zoom and other applications.
    - The STREAM_BUFFER_ATTR command is now implemented.
    - Module names are improved. (#2076)
    - Many small fixes and improvements.
    - Fix a pavucontrol crash with invalid channels. (#1442)
  * JACK
    - Use the new force-quantum and force-rate properties in the
      JACK API to switch quantum and ensure it can't change for
      the lifetime of the JACK app. (#2079)
- Rebase patch:
  * reduce-meson-dependency.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  1 14:23:13 UTC 2022 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- pipewire should be a true dependency, not just recommended (e.g.,
  so that any setup that use no-recommends, like MicroOS, also work) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 27 14:04:28 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch to reduce the meson requirement so we can build
  pipewire with Leap 15.3. This will be dropped as soon as
  Leap 15.4 is released or if it becomes too hard to maintain
  (whatever happens before):
  * reduce-meson-dependency.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 27 10:45:39 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.3.44:
  * Highlights:
    - It is now possible to run a minimal PipeWire server without a
      session manager, enough to run JACK clients.
    - The maximum buffer size is now configurable and can be larger
      than the previously hardcoded limit of 8192 samples.
      When using high sample rates, the larger buffer size can
      avoid xruns.
    - The default maximum latency was reduced from 170ms to 42ms.
      This should improve overall latency for application that ask
      for a large latency, such as notifications.
    - Better JACK compatibility. Patchbays should now get less
      confused about ports appearing and disappearing.
    - Fix some bluetooth crashes.
    - Fix some races in ALSA device detection.
    - Many bug fixes and improvements all over the place.
  * PipeWire:
    - Bump the meson requirement to 0.59.0.
    - pw-top now reports correct times for filter-chain and
      loopback.
    - max-quantum is now also scaled with the rate. A new
      quantum-limit property was added as a hard limit for the
      quantum. This makes it possible to configure for larger than
      8192 buffer sizes. Note than many JACK applications have a
      hardcoded 8192 limit.
    - The max-quantum was reduced to 2048, This gives a 42ms
      default latency.
    - pw-filter can now return a NULL buffer from _get_dsp_buffer()
    - Add a PIPEWIRE_RATE and PIPEWIRE_QUANTUM env variable to set
      the graph rate and the graph quantum and rate respectively.
    - Fix a potential file descriptor leak in the connection.
    - A new minimal.conf file was added to demonstrate a static
      setup of a daemon that doesn't require a session manager and
      is able to run JACK applicaions.
    - Nice levels are now only changed on the servers, not the
      clients.
    - Add an option to suspend nodes when idle.
    - Make it possible to avoid quantum and rate changes with
      pw-metadata. This is essential in a locked down system.
    - Handle mixer port errors better and fail to create the link
      instead of silently not working.
    - Nodes that are moved to a driver now have all the linked
      nodes moved as well. This makes it possible to run some
      graphs without a driver, such as paplay -> zita-j2n.
    - pw-cli and pw-dump can now also list objects by name, serial
      and object.path using glob style pattern matching.
  * modules:
    - filter-chain can now also configure parameters by index.
    - Fix the client name of module-protocol-simple.
    - module-rtkit was merged into module-rt. This makes it easier
      to ship a default config that works on more systems by
      default.
    - module-adapter can now configure the adapter node from the
      config. Previously, this was a task only performed by the
      session manager.
    - module-metadata can now also create metadata object from the
      config file.
    - The ROC module should now work again.
    - An X11-bell module was added to handle X11 bell events.
    - filter-chain and loopback modules now have better unique
      default names for the streams, which makes it possible to
      save and restore their volumes independently.
    - module-echo-cancel now has properties to control the delay
      and buffer size.
  * ALSA:
    - The monitor names are now correctly parsed.
    - The default period size for batch devices is limited now to
      avoid large latency.
    - The unused min/max-latency properties were removed.
    - Internal latency is now also configurable with params at
      runtime.
    - The udev rule for TI2902 was removed because it causes
      problems.
    - Fix a race where some devices would sometimes be missing.
    - Add some more timeouts to work around a race in udev device
      permission changes when switching VTs.
  * SPA:
    - Fix potential infinite loop in audioconvert.
    - The spa-resample tools can now also use optimised
      implementations.
    - Fix a potential crash in resampler.
    - audioconvert can now also handle F64 formats.
    - The channelmixer now does normalization by default to avoid
      clipping when downmixing is active.
    - The channelmixer will now generate LFE channels when the
      lfe_cutoff frequency is set, even when upmix is disabled.
    - The channelmixer will now always generate FC when the target
      has it.
    - Adapter now reports latency correctly, even after linking the
      monitor ports.
    - Reduce memory usage and preallocated memory in some of the
      audioconvert nodes.
    - Many properties are now exposed in adapter, such as the
      resample quality.
    - The resampler and channelmixer can now be disabled.
  * V4L2:
    - pw-v4l2 now also works for ffplay.
    - Take product names from udev now that the kernel returns 
      generic name.
  * JACK:
    - The jack pkgconfig file now has the
      jack_implementation=pipewire variable to be able to
      distinguish jack implementations.
    - jconvolver now starts correctly again.
    - The object.serial is now used for the port_id. This makes it
      easier to track old objects in the cache.
    - Add a dummy jacknet implementation.
    - A bug in the port allocation was fixed that would make it
      impossible to allocate ports at some point.
  * Bluetooth:
    - Bluetooth profiles are now saved properly by the
      session manager.
    - Improved profile detections, increased timeouts for slow
      devices.
    - Implement HFP call indicator for improved compatibility.
    - Handle the case where bluez does not set the adapter or
      address properties on the device instead of crashing.
    - Improved support for setting the profile from the
      session manager.
  * pulse-server:
    - Monitor sources now have the device.class=monitor for better
      compatibility.
    - Behaviour after seeking is improved. The algorithm for
      requesting bytes from the client was simplified and improved.
    - module-ladspa-sink implements the control argument now.
    - A potential memory leak in the message queue was fixed.
    - Use the object.serial for the pulseaudio object index. The
      index is not supposed to be reused and this would cause
      problems with some clients.
    - Servers should now again be able to listen in IPv4.
    - module-x11-bell was added.
    - There is now support for per-application quirks and
      properties in the pipewire-pulse.conf file. Per-application
      latency and buffering properties can also be configured.
    - Fix a regression in telegram sounds not playing.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-alsa-improve-rate-selection.patch
  * 0001-audioconvert-avoid-infinite-loop.patch
  * 0001-bluez5-dont-create-device-if-adapter-is-missing.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 19 16:49:42 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add several more patches from upstream 
- BlueZ may be missing adapter information for devices in some cases.
  Ignore devices without specified adapter:
  * 0001-bluez5-dont-create-device-if-adapter-is-missing.patch
- Fix a case when pipewwire could never call callbacks or even
  block forever when loop is not running:

- Improve rate selection so we don't select an invalid rate when
  the default is set or the card is already opened in an
  unsupported rate:
  * 0001-alsa-improve-rate-selection.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 16:34:05 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add several patches from upstream
- Avoid an infinite loop when enumerating params of the converter:
  * 0001-audioconvert-avoid-infinite-loop.patch
- When the device or adapter is NULL, skip the quirk checks instead
  of crashing:
  * 0001-bluez5-handle-missing-device-and-adapter-in-quirks.patch
- Remember the last returned value from jack_get_buffer_size and
  only emit a buffersize change event when something new is
  configured. This fixes startup of jconvolver.
  * 0001-jack-remember-last-return-from-jack_get_buffer_size.patch
- Better emulation of pulseaudio which shows monitor sources with
  device.class=monitor so now pipewire does that too:
  * 0001-pulse-server-show-monitor-sources-with-device_class_monitor.patch
- Fix an errno check:
  * 0001-raop-fix-errno-check.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 12 12:48:21 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Added more baselibs packages and their dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  5 16:23:30 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.43:
  * Highlights:
    - Flatpak apps such as Ardour can now remove links again.
    - Many fixes to pulse-server. Memory usage should be improved.
      Some crashes are fixed. Underrun handling should work better.
      Better compatibility with GStreamer based applications after
      seeking.
    - Many of the samplerate and quantum changes bugs in previous
      releases were fixed. This fixes some issues where the
      microphone would fail to work.
    - Many more small fixes and improvements all over the place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 16:42:31 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Revert the merge of spa-plugins and modules into the library
  package.
- Move some of the files between packages where they make more
  sense.
- Rename the modules subpackage to modules-%{apiver_str} so
  it can be versioned more easily (there still are some unversioned
  files in the package, but it's a step in the right direction)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 14:03:56 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove unneccesary Conflicts with packages that are Obsoleted

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 12:32:49 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.42:
  * Highlights

      and orca.
    - A fix was added to pulse-server to handle quantum changes
      gracefully.
    - Fix module-echo-cancel again.
    - Fix a bug where the bluetooth headset capture was producing
      noise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:28:10 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove the dependency on wireplumber-audio which was pulling in
  pulseaudio. We'll require wireplumber-audio directly from
  wireplumber.
- Remove pipewire-rpmlintrc since the filters don't apply anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:27:44 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Merge the pipewire-spa-plugins-0_2 and pipewire-modules
  packages into the libpipewire package just as the fedora packages
  do and simplify the filelist a bit by using some recursive
  listing instead of explicitly listing all files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 10:33:29 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Use the gcc9-c++ compiler in SLE/Leap so it builds successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 09:45:21 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.41:
  * Highlights
    - Improved compatibility for flatpaks. Flatpaks with newer
      PipeWire version can connect to an older server in all cases.
    - A new RAOP module was added to stream to Apple Airplay
      devices.
    - OBS can now capture from the monitor devices again when using
      WirePlumber.
    - Improved JACK compatibility. Improved stability in Carla and
      Ardour when changing buffer size. Improved latency
      calculations and playback latency in Ardour.
    - Improved pulse-server handling of underruns and buffer size
      changes.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - The systemd service files now have better names.
    - client.access permission checks are improved.
    - Fix some memory leaks in error paths.
    - Objects now have a global serial number that is unique for
      the lifetime of the server.
    - Make clock.rate, clock.allowed-rates and clock.quantum
      runtime tunable parameters with the settings metadata.
    - Add some additional memory checks in client-node to avoid
      sending invalid memory to clients. (#1859)
    - Improve buffer memory allocation. If one of the nodes is a
      remote node, ensure we only use memory that can be shared.
    - Version checks when binding to objects is removed. This means
      that newer clients can now bind to older servers, which is a
      typical case for a flatpak.
    - A bug in the latency calculations was fixed where it would in
      some cases report the wrong minumum latency.
  * modules
    - module-echo-cancel has voice-detection enabled now.
    - module-raop-sink and module-raop-discover to stream audio to
      an Apple Airplay device.
    - module-filter-chain now has preliminary support for LV2
      plugins.
  * SPA
    - The audio resampler now has improved buffer size
      calculations. In some cases it was too small and would cause
      distortions.
    - More checks are done when doing volume changes so that the
      channelmap is correct.
    - Audioadapter now exposes most config options with params so
      that they can be adjusted at runtime.
    - The resampler can now calculate the expected input buffer
      size before receiving the first buffer, which avoids some
      confusion when starting streams.
    - Support was added for some 10bit video formats.
    - MONO channel handling was improved.
    - Most plugins now set a clock name and this is configurable
      where it makes sense. The clock.system.monotonic clock name
      is used for most plugins that use the system clock for
      timing.
  * pulse-server
    - implement module-raop-discover
    - Use STREAM_CAPTURE_SINK property when capturing from a
      monitor source to better inform the session manager. This
      fixes some issues where OBS would capture from the
      microphone instead of the output monitor.
    - Limit the amount of cache messages to 16MB and don't add
      large memory blocks to the cache. This should fix some
      excessive memory usage that people reported.
    - Fix a potential memory leak when cleaning up a client.
    - Do some additional checks to avoid buffer overruns.
    - Improve recovery from underruns better. (#1857) This improves
      seeking in gnome-music.
    - Improve recovery when the quantum is forced larger that the
      stream configured latency.
    - The prebuf state is now handled correctly.
  * JACK
    - A per type object cache is now implemented. This ensures that
      port objects remain valid for a longer time because many JACK
      applications inspect objects after they are destroyed. This
      improves catia/carla compatibility.
    - Recompute the latencies when the buffer-size changes. Fix
      some cases where we would end up with negative latencies.
    - Handle regcomp errors to avoid some crashes later.
    - Latency calculations are improved a lot.
    - More care is taken to not call a process callback while a
      buffer size change is pending. This fixes some crashes in
      Carla, which expect that all clients are paused when one
      handles the buffersize callback.
    - Loopback links to a client are now handled correctly and
      without latency. This fixes playback latency in ardour6
      (#1839)
  * ALSA
    - ALSA devices now keep track of the samplerate of the card
      and ensure that all PCM use the same rate. This is a
      workaround for a kernel bug that is fixed in 5.16.
    - Refactor the ALSA plugin a little.
    - The ALSA plugin now reports correct delay for a capture PCM.
      (#1697)
    - The ALSA nodes now expose all config options with params
      that can be changed at runtime.
    - The ALSA node has a configurable clock name. Adaptive
      resampling to match clock rates is avoided when the driver
      has the same clock name as the ALSA node. This can be used
      to link alsa devices together with a word clock.

    pipewire-pulseaudio package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 12 12:47:56 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.40:
  * Highlights:
    - Producers and consumers can now incrementally negotiate a
      format by narrowing down the options. This can be used to
      select an optimal combination of format and modifiers.
    - Driver nodes such as the consumer of a headless compositor
      can now throttle the speed based on a new trigger_done event.
    - Headless compositors can now signal a damage event to
      consumers to start the processing of the graph.
    - Compatibility improvements in JACK.
    - Draining and resuming is now working correctly in pulse and
      alsa.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire:
    - Many BSD fixes.
    - clang compilation fixes.
    - Fix map implementation on big-endian machines.
    - Improve tracking of param changes in pw-stream.
    - Add support for renegotiation. With this change, producer and
      consumer can incrementally renegotiate a format until it is
      fixed. This will be used to do complex negotiation of DRM
      modifiers.
    - Add a trigger-done event in the stream. This can be used to
      know when processing of the complete graph has finished after
      issuing a trigger_process() and it can be used to throttle
      processing.
    - Add a RequestProcess node event and command. This can be used
      by non-driver nodes to suggest to a driver to start
      processing. One case is where a compositor can emit this
      event as a result of a screen update to let the headless
      compositor start an update.
    - Fix zeroconf sample format.
    - pw-mon outputs to stderr now and has colors.
  * SPA:
    - Fix compilation on ppc and armv7.
    - Fix port type check for ALSA seq midi ports so that they are
      not falsely listed as hardware.
    - Fix crash when running SSE code on unsupported HW.
    - The libcamera plugin was rewritten. It now supports hotplug,
      format enumeration and an easier to read codebase.
    - Fix compatibility some more for cards with 64 channels.
  * pulse-server:
    - Flush data in pause in combine-sink to avoid stray audio
      fragments.
    - Fix a race where not all objects were removed correctly.
    - The latency calculations and setup was improved to more
      closely match pulseaudio behaviour. PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC should
      now resemble pulseaudio more closely.
    - The drained reply is now sent only once and new data will be
      accepted once the drain completes.
    - Fix a potential crasher bug where the stream started
      processing before the setup was completed.
    - The server will now drop the client connections when the
      pipewire connection is lost.
  * JACK:
    - Rework the jack_port_get_buffer() method to return the same
      memory when called multiple times during the process()
      callback. This makes things work on a new Hydrogen.
    - Add an option to disable showing the monitor ports.
    - JACK ports are now sorted per node/client and port_id. This
      should more closely match JACK behaviour and avoid random
      port order.
  * v4l2:
    - Fix v4l2 LD_PRELOAD script.
    - Make sure we destroy the proxy when the global is destroyed.
  * ALSA:
    - _prepare should exit the draining state.
    - Fix the precision of the _delay function by taking into
      account the amount of queued samples are the correct
      samplerate.
- Drop patches fixed upstream:
  * 0001-cpu-fix-compilation-on-some-architectures.patch
  * 0001-map-make-_insert_at-fail-on-a-removed-item.patch
  * 0002-map-use-uintptr_t-for-the-next-pointer.patch

  pipewire-media-session.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 09:27:57 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.39
  * Highlights
    - media-session is now moved into a separate module to speed up
      its deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
    - There is now an LD_PRELOAD v4l2 emulation library to run some
      existing v4l2 applications on top of PipeWire.
    - Filter-chains should now flush out remaining samples when
      paused. There is now also the option to let a filter-chain
      drain so that long filters
    such as reverbs can fade out properly.
    - Stability and compatibility improvements in JACK apps.
    - Better Bluetooth compatibility with more devices.
    - libcamera plugin improvements.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements all over the map.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix compilation on ARM.
    - Log topics are added to most modules.
    - Documentation updates. Many improvements to the layout.
      Reorganisation of the modules and groups.
    - Share a work queue for all links and nodes. This removes the
      need for a separate eventfd per link and per node.
    - Catch errors in the map implementation.
    - Add option to compile without dbus support.
    - Fix biquad frequency. It was using the wrong sample rate.
    - Fix a potential crash when destroying nodes, in some cases
      the node would not be deactivated properly.
    - Add some more helpers for dealing with properties and their
      values.
    - Implement flush and reset on virtual sinks/sources.
    - Make it possible to let virtual sinks/filter-chains run and
      drain after being idle.
    - Fix a bug where the quantum could exceed the maximum because
      it was scaled with the sample rate.
    - Fix channel_map parsing in module-zeroconf-discover so that
      the remote channel map is used.
    - pw-stream errors emitted on the proxy are reported but not
      fatal any more. They are usually used by the session manager
      to signal status to the client but otherwise does not really
      cause an error on the client.
    - Links now also store the output and input node id in the
      global properties so that applications can parse and use them
      regardless of how the link was made. (#1723)
    - pw-stream and pw-filter now have an event to notify commands.
    - The echo-cancel module can now operate on larger quantums.
    - pw-cat now uses the right metadata to find the default
      devices in --list-targets.
  * media-session
    - Don't try to remix unpositioned streams when linking. This
      ensures that linking to Pro-Audio nodes does not remix the
      stream channels but links them as they are, one by one.
    - media-session is now moved to a separate module to accelerate
      its deprecation in favour of WirePlumber.
  * SPA
    - Many libcamera improvements, handle MemFd buffers, handle
      errors gracefully.
    - Small improvements to make interface fall-backs easier to
      implement.
    - Add support to enable flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero
      to avoid high CPU usage when dealing with denormals.
    - AUX13 channels are no longer reported as AUX12. (#1727)
    - Devices with more than 32 channels in Pro-Audio mode now only
      uses AUX channels.
    - Improve windowing function of the resampler to reduce
      aliasing and improve the quality.
  * JACK
    - Port connect callbacks will not only be emitted after the
      port has negotiated buffers, which improves compatibility
      with applications that try to use the port right after the
      callback (jack_midi_latency_test).
    - Fix crash when midi ports were removed and being monitored,
      like in Ardour.
  * pulse-server
    - The pulse tunnel will now use the specified
      format/rate/channels.
    - Improve lookup of default source and fall back to the
      monitors when no sources are available.
    - Mark some nodes as network nodes so that we can set the
      NETWORK flag correctly.
  * GStreamer
    - The GStreamer element not releases the buffers in the stream
      again in all cases so that they can be reused by other
      streams.
  * v4l2
    - Add a v4l2 LD_PRELOAD library to emulate v4l2 system calls on
      top of PipeWire. This is tested with firefox and GStreamer
      and is known to not work with Chrome.
  * Bluetooth
    - AAC compatibility improvements.
    - Disable hardware volume for "Tribit MAXSound Plus" and
      "SoundCore mini".
    - Add quirk to disable faststream. Disable faststream on
      "FiiO BTR3".
    - Add a dummy AVRCP player to improve compatibility with some
      devices.
- Remove patch:
  * 0001-fix-compilation-on-ARM.patch
- Add patch from upstream:
  * 0001-cpu-fix-compilation-on-some-architectures.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 13 09:10:51 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix compilation on ARM (boo#1191600):
  * 0001-fix-compilation-on-ARM.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 30 10:03:37 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.38:
  * Highlights
    - Topic based logging was added to improve debugging.
    - An off-by-one error was fixed in the audio resampler that could
      cause distortion when downsampling.
    - Various bluetooth compatibility improvements.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - module-pulse-tunnel now has better default latency to make it work
      better in more cases. There is also an option to configure the
      desired latency.
    - pw-cli now has readline support.
    - Topic based logging was added. Log lines can now be filtered by
      topic using wildcards. This should improve debugging.
    - The systemd service files should now have better descriptions.
    - Fix a crash in module-zeroconf-discover when unloading.
    - Fix a crash in filter-chain when using unaligned memory.
  * ALSA
    - Sync the udev rules and profiles with pulseaudio.
    - Fix a memory leak.
  * SPA plugins
    - An off-by-one error was fixed in the resampler that could cause
      distortion when downsampling. (#1646)
  * Bluetooth
    - Avoid probing the native backend because it might block for DBus
      activation. This fixes some long startup times.
    - Fix the kernel version check, 5.14.x kernels should also support
      mSBC.
    - Fix FastStream microphone support in more cases.
    - Add workaround for Intel AX200.
    - SCO sink should now also work in follower mode.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Make the service file require a session manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 29 18:51:13 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(readline) so pw-cli is built with
  readline support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 09:20:46 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.37:
  * Highlights
    - Capture and playback is now avoided even more on unavailable
      devices. This should fix some issues where an unusable
      microphone was selected by default. It should now also again
      be possible to select an unavailable device as the default.
    - Native DSD audio playback is now supported. pw-cat can now
      also play DSF files with the -d option.
    - JACK stability improvements with buffer-size and samplerate
      changes in some apps.
    - Many cleanups and bugfixes all over the place.
  * PipeWire
    - pw-metadata -d does not cause an infinite loop anymore.
      (#1622)
    - Increase some plugin buffer sizes to fix some issues with
      many channels. (#1620)
    - Protect the global plugin list with a lock. Make sure
      pw_init() is locked. Fixes some issues with concurrent ALSA
      plugin usage.
  * media-session
    - Unavailable devices can be set as the default again. (#1624)
    - Do a better check if a device has available routes and avoid
      selecting devices with unavailable routes as default.
    - Media-session was moved to its own directory. It used to live
      in examples but it is past the example stage and it
      interferes with the build options for the real examples.
  * Bluetooth
    - The hardware quirk database is now loaded by the plugin
      instead of the session manager. This makes it also work with
      wireplumber.
  * ALSA
    - The ALSA mixer now handles device removal much better.
      (#1627)
  * libcamera
    - Many fixes and improvement to the libcamera plugin. (#1513)
  * pulse-server
    - Improve compatibility with pulseaudio module arguments.
    - Parse channel_map arguments in module-loopback. (#1486)
  * JACK
    - Delay emiting the samplerate and buffersize callbacks until
      the client is active. This fixes some crashes with Carla and
      other JACK apps.

- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-media-session-dont-use-after-free-if-linking-node-removed.patch
  * 0002-update-version-number-as-well.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 20 06:51:15 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patches from upstream to fix an "use-after-free" error and
  to set the version number correctly:
  * 0001-media-session-dont-use-after-free-if-linking-node-removed.patch
  * 0002-update-version-number-as-well.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 14:23:44 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.36:
  * Highlights
    - A quick update with mostly only bugfixes and small
      improvements.
    - Capture and playback is now avoided on unavailable devices.
      This should fix some issues where an unusable microphone was
      selected by default.
    - MIDI output should not stop randomly now.
    - The GStreamer elements are much improved, cheese should work
      a lot better now.
    - Virtual sinks and sources should now always show up
      immediately.
    - JACK processing is now delayed until buffersize and
      samplerate are emited. This should improve stability of many
      JACK apps.
    - JACK transport sync is now implemented correctly so that
      preroll in bitwig works.
  * PipeWire
    - The module dir environment variable can now contain multiple
      paths.
    - Documentation now contains dot graphs of dependencies.
      (#1585)
    - config min/max/default quantum values are now scaled with the
      samplerate.
    - A potential crash was fixed where destroyed memory was still
      used by a node. This could cause crashes in cheese.
  * pipewire-media-session
    - Only allow passthrough for passthrough formats (S/PDIF) for
      now. (#1587)
    - Improve bluetooth profile autoswitch.
    - Don't try to route audio to nodes with unavailable routes.
  * ALSA
    - Pass the right AES bits to the alsa device when opening an
      S/PDIF stream.
    - Fix a bug in the MIDI bridge port management logic. When a
      port was added and immediately removed, output would stop.
  * GStreamer
    - The GStreamer source now handles the flushing state
      correctly.
    - All blocking operations now have a 30 seconds timeout, to
      avoid infinite locks.
  * Plugins
    - V4l2 Device formats and controls are now passed on the node,
      just like with audio devices.
    - audioconvert now also exposes the softMute property.
  * JACK
    - Improve stability when changing buffer size and sample rate
      dynamically by pausing the processing until the application
      has handled the callback.
    - Improve handling of timebase master. When the master was
      moved to another driver, it did not attempt to become a new
      timebase master on the new driver. (#1589)
    - Implement transport sync to make preroll in bitwig work.
      (#1589)
  * pulse-server
    - Fix an issue where virtual sinks/sources would not show up
      immediately. (#1588)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  9 08:49:42 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.35:
  * Highlights:
    - S/PDIF passthrough over optical or HDMI is now implemented.
    - Some critical fixes to MIDI, draining of streams and various
      modules.
    - skypeforlinux should work better now after adding it to the
      quirks database.
    - Bluetooth codecs are now in separate plugins to make it
      easier to ship them.
  * PipeWire: 
    - Drain was fixed in pw-stream. In some cases it would not
      clear the drain state correctly. Fixes the issue where
      speaker-test would only play one channel.
    - Loopback connections to a driver will now activate the
      driver. This fixes an issue where MIDI connections between
      devices or some applications (puredata) would not get any
      MIDI messages. (#1559)x.
    - The audiomixer can now mix more formats. Together with the
      passthrough improvements this can be used to avoid
      conversions to/from the DSP format in some cases.
    - Make sure we idle drivers when removing a node from it in all
      cases. JACK clients could keep a driver node busy.
    - Add new methods to accumulate object info. The old one was
      difficult to use when applications need to accumulate
      multiple changes.
    - A new interface to load modules has been added. Plugins can
      use this to ask the host (PipeWire) to load spa plugins.
    - Increase param buffer size to handle larger params. Nodes
      with a large number of channels would sometimes not have
      properties. (#1574)
    - Concurrent link negotiation that caused some links to not
      work, is now avoided. This fixes monitor ports in Ardour6.
    - Small tweaks to how the quantum and rate are handled when
      nodes move between drivers. Make node.lock-quantum work with
      node.latency
  * PipeWire modules:
    - The convolver plugin in filter-chain has been optimized some
      more.
    - The echo-cancel stream properties were improved so that it
      actually can remember the streams it links to. (#1557)
    - module-pulse-tunnel had the buffer attributes wrong and would
      cause high latency with older pulseaudio servers. (#1434)
    - module-roc had the properties configured wrongly, which would
      cause it to not work at all in most cases. (#1538)
    - There is now an example of a 7.1 virtual surround sink using
      the hesuvi impulse responses.
    - The convolver now supports dirac pulses as the IR.
  * ALSA:
    - UCM config is now cached per device, using up less memory. It
      also temporarily works around a problem in alsa-lib that is
      now being patched and rolled out. Should stop devices from
      disappearing when logging out and back in. (#1553)
    - Fix the MIDI clock rate matching. It was too sensitive to
      small changes and would spiral out of control and break MIDI
      rather quickly.
  * pipewire-media-session:
    - The media session can now save and restore IEC958 (S/PDIF)
      codecs for the sinks.
    - Passthrough of IEC958 (S/PDIF) content is now possible. If
      the client and the sink contain a compatible set of codecs,
      an exclusive connection can be made between client and sink to pass
      the encoded S/PDIF content directly to the device.
    - Use new introspection info update methods to suspend nodes in
      all cases. Sometimes, nodes would fail to suspend because the
      state info was not evaluated.
    - The media session can now work in non-DSP mode, which will
      try to avoid any audio conversions between client and device
      when possible. But, this will also disable compatibility with
      JACK applications.
  * Bluetooth
    - Bluetooth codecs are now compiled into separate plugins which
      are dynamically loaded. This makes it possible to change the
      plugin implementation or ship plugins separately without
      having to recompile the bluetooth module.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Delay stream create reply until the stream is linked to a
      sink/source.
    - The device-restore extension is now implemented. This makes
      it possible to configure the IEC958 (S/PDIF) codecs supported
      by the sink with pavucontrol.
    - skypeforlinux now uses the same quirks as teams to make the
      sinks show up in all cases. This fixes the issue of not being
      able to hear the remote end in skypeforlinux.
  * JACK
    - Improve catia and carla compatibility by caching objects a
      little longer after being removed. (#1531)
    - JACK ports now notify the negotiated format correctly.
    - A potential deadlock was fixed when multiple threads would
      perform a call that would require a roundtrip.
    - Improve bufsize callback, it should not be called right after
      doing activate() but only when the buffersize changes later.
    - Add tweak to disable the process lock. Some older apps might
      not expect it. (#1576)
  * Docs
    - man pages are now generated with rst2man.
    - DMA-BUF docs were updated.
    - Documentation updates.
- Replace BuildRequires xmltoman with docutils (rst2man)
- Update libcamera Buildrequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 08:33:01 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libcap) since it's being searched
  by the build scripts.
- Replace BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libopenaptx) with libfreeaptx
  since openaptx has a license issue
- Use bcond_with to enable/disable the usage of libcamera
  (the defaults are not changed: it's disabled in Leap since
  upstream doesn't recommend enabling it yet and enabled in TW
  since we can allow some experimental support there)
- Changes suggested by darix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 26 12:27:15 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.34:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes some critical issues with previous release. Such as
      devices not showing up and default devices being lost.
    - Support for consumer driver streams to make the producer
      v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless compositor
      setup.
    - Improvements to routing of streams.
    - Bluetooth battery status support for head-set profile and
      using Apple extensions. aptX-LL and FastStream codec support
      was added.
    - Internal latency of ALSA devices can now be configured.
    - A fast convolver was added to the filter-chain to implement
      virtual surround sinks or reverbs.
  * PipeWire
    - Add support for streams that are driver nodes for the graph.
      This was already possible for source streams but it is now
      also possible for playback streams. This can be used to let
      a producer v-sync to the consumer monitor in a headless
      compositor setup. (#1484)
    - State files are now stored in XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
      XDG_CONFIG_HOME. They will still be loaded from the config
      home if they are not in the new state home, to ease
      migration.
    - Set a driver on inactive nodes to make transport work in
      xjadeo. (#1491)
    - Fix parsing of filter-chain controls.
    - A new FFT based convolver was added to module-filter-chain.
      It uses a 0-latency 2 stage convolver with small FFT for the
      head and a large FFT for the tail of the convolution. A
      convolution can be used to implement IR based reverbs, HRIR
      surround sound or other convolution based operations. An
      example HRIR virtual surround sound sink has been added as
      well.
    - module-filter-chain was reworked a bit to support more config
      options for the plugins.
    - Endian conversion and alaw/ulaw formats are now supported for
      streams.
    - pw-cat will now suggest a samplerate for the graph.
    - SPA_PLUGIN_DIR can now search in multiple paths separated
      with a ':'.
    - Passthrough mode has been worked on and has been partially
      merged. S/PDIF definitions have been added and ALSA devices
      updated to report and configure S/PDIF formats. The session
      manager changes to fully configure and enable passthrough
      mode will hopefully be merged next time.
    - Fix a race in pw-stream where it would not always emit the
      right events.
  * ALSA
    - Fix volume changed check. It was checking against the wrong
      value and this could cause rounding errors.
    - The ALSA plugin now also uses RT scheduling.
    - Fix the behringer UMC202 usb device id, it was using a
      generic TI chip ID that caused problems.
    - Fix USB devices that don't show up anymore. Use an ALSA
      workaround to fix this. (#1478)
    - Add a rule for the new firmware of Sennheiser GSX 1200.
    - ALSA sink and source can now use ProcessLatency param to
      configure the internal latency. The latencyOffsetNsec
      property is also exposed so that the latency can be adjusted
      in pavucontrol as well.
  * media-session
    - Fix a critical issue where the default device was not
      remembered anymore when it was removed.
    - Fix the issue where some apps need to be restarted when
      nodes go away and reappear.
    - Improve routing of streams. Streams that have a specific
      target set will now be moved to the target when it appears
      instead of staying on the fallback.
    - Small memory leak fixes.
    - Try to switch back to the user selected profile after
      finishing a Bluetooth recording.
  * Bluetooth
    - Add support for HF indicator 2 battery status.
    - Add support for XAPL battery status.
    - Set the Communication intended role for HFP profile.
    - Enable SBC-XQ by default if not disabled by quirks.
    - Fix some potential crashes due to excessive polling.
    - Add aptx-LL codec and enable duplex for aptx-LL devices.
    - Add FastStream codec. This is a codec that can use a
      duplex SBC channel.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Suggests a samplerate for the graph.
    - Support for handling S/PDIF (IEC958) formats was added. This
      will start working when the session manager supports
      configuring streams and nodes in passthrough mode.
    - Be smarter when handling devices without a negotiated format
      yet so that they are visible as well. This makes virtual
      devices show up immediately.
  * ALSA plugin
    - Now suggests a samplerate for the graph.
  * JACK
    - The jack.pc file can only be generated with meson >= 0.59.0.
      When the jack-devel option is enabled, it will generate an
      error with older meson.
    - Small stability improvements when connecting/disconnecting in
      Ardour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  5 14:54:31 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.33:
  * Highlights
    - Better support for virtual sinks/sources for Pro Audio
      profile.
    - Better DMA-BUF format modifier negotiation.
    - Support multiple sample rates in the graph. Not enabled
      by default yet.
    - Bluetooth can now automatically switch between headset
      and audio profile.
    - Documentation updates.
    - Many improvements and crasher fixes.
  * PipeWire
    - Make AUX channels an official channel map, use this for the
      PRO audio profile so that we can name the channels. This
      make it possible to define virtual sources and sinks for
      Pro Audio devices in a more reliable way.
    - Fix scheduling of some virtual sinks/sources. (#1407)
    - Fix potential corruption of ringbuffer because of multiple
      concurrent writers. This might be the cause for many reported
      crashes. (#1451)
    - Don't place sockets in $HOME. (#1443)
    - Improve DMA-BUF negotiation. Add a flag to avoid fixation
      of a property so that producers can negotiate more
      efficiently. This is used to negotiate DMA-BUF modifiers,
      which should make more efficient use of the GPU. (#1084)
    - Add support for multipe sample rates. The graph can switch
      when IDLE to one of the supported rates. Add an option to
      lock the rate as well. This is not enabled by default yet
      because of driver bugs that need to be worked around first.
    - Add node.lock-quantum property that can be used to lock the
      quantum in place.
    - Improve latency reporting in the loopback module.
    - Make new client-node method to send the peer port id to the
      mixer. This can be used to know where the buffers entering the
      mixer are coming from. (#1471)
  * Tools
    - pw-top should now also correctly show bluetooth devices.
      (#1540)
  * media-session
    - Handle unset of the default node.
    - Added a module that can switch the bluetooth profile to headset
      profile when a stream wants to record from it.
  * JACK
    - Only call the jack callbacks when the client is active. Some
      JACK applications don't expect callbacks before the client is
      active and crash (x42-dpl). (#1461)
    - Emit client unregister event.
    - Add per-client match rules in the config file to set app
      specific configuration and tweaks. (#1456)
    - Use peer_id to implement jack_port_get_buffer() from one of
      our peer ports to get the data before it enters the mixer.
      Makes the capture monitors work in Ardour6.8. (#1471)
  * Bluetooth
    - Add some broken kernel versions to the mSBC blocklist
    - Avoid looping and consuming CPU when we can't write to the
      BT socket.
    - Use libfreeaptx instead of libopenaptx.
    - Fix rounding errors in HW volume conversion.
  * PulseAudio server
    - implement module-switch-on-connect to emulate pulseaudio
      behaviour of new devices. Some desktop environments expect
      this behaviour and break otherwise.
    - Fix stream cleanup, make sure the stream is stopped before
      destroying it. Might be cause for some of the reported
      crashes.
    - Update message API to use the JSON format.
  * Other
    - Many documentation updates.
    - Many cleanups and small improvements.
    - Support the latest libcamera version. (#1435)
- Drop pipewire-fix-libcamera-build.patch, merged upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 06:23:36 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Move with-{alsa,jack,pulseaudio} from the media-session package
  to the packages that implement each support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 22 07:55:13 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Add patch pipewire-fix-libcamera-build.patch: fix build with
  latest libcamera.
- Do no build libcamera support on Leap 15.3 or lower (too old
  libcamera) and change name of BuildRequires from camera to
  libcamera.
- Update minimal version for alsa buildrequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 20 12:46:57 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.32:
  * Highlights
    - Real-time priority handling for threads was reworked.
      Freewheeling will now drop RT priorities to avoid being
      killed.
    - Problems with filter chains and echo-cancel being linked in
      a loop was fixed.
    - alsamixer should now be able to see the mixer controls again.
    - JACK has seen some latency reporting improvements that make
      Ardour report latencies correctly.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Fix a bug in the neon audio resampler code.
    - There is now a node.link-group property to relate linked
      streams. this can be used to track the dataflow with
      coupled streams.
    - Fix a crash when recalculating latency on a destroyed
      port. (#1371)
    - Filter chains and other modules that create streams can
      now also be added to the daemon config itself. (#1309)
    - Fix some potential deadlocks in timerfd. (#1377)
    - Feedback links are skipped when recalculating latency to
      avoid loops.
    - The dummy driver and null-sink now stop the timerfd when
      following another driver instead of generating useless
      graph wakeups.
    - rt.limit was increased to 2 seconds. Some applications got
      killed because they run lengthy code in the Real-Time
      thread. (#1344)
    - Fix s24_32 to float, it was not sign extending
      properly. (#1393)
    - The performance of the feedback loop check algorithm was
      improved a lot, making complex graphs start much much faster.
    - The zeroconf publish module now doesn't republish nodes
      every time the volume changes. (#1406)
    - A potential memory corruption error has been fixed in the
      loop that could cause random crashes.
    - Mempools can now be created from multiple threads at the
      same time.
  * media-session
    - Loops in coupled streams are now avoided. (#1394)
    - Port changes for inactive profiles are ignored now by
      the default-route module. (#1403)
  * ALSA
    - Make sure tha alibpref is not part of the device node name
      because it is random. (#1362)
    - Fixed an off-by-one that could cause midi events to end up
      with a wrong timestamp and thus being discarded by
      some apps. (#1395)
    - Fix some memory leaks when destroying a card object.
  * JACK
    - Fix some invalid cycle wakeups that could cause JACK
      application to run with a 0 buffer size. (#1386)
    - JACK can now use rtkit to manage realtime priorities
      on threads.
    - The Real-time priority is dropped when entering freewheel
      mode to make sure we don't get killed when using
      too much CPU.
    - jack_recompute_total_latencies() is now implemented, fixing
      the latency reporting in Ardour. (#1388)
    - Fix some overflows in time calculations.
    - Ensure frame_rate in position is never 0.
    - Graph callbacks are now emitted as well.
  * Bluetooth
    - RTP payload type is now set correctly for aptX, LDAC and
      SBC, which should improve compatibility with devices that
      care about this.
  * PulseAudio server
    - There is now a quirks database to deal with bad clients.
      The database is builtin but can be made external later.
          Teams is now lied to and told all sink/sources use
          s16 samples to make it show all sinks/sources.
          Firefox is forced to remove the DONT_MOVE flag on
          capture streams so that you can move firefox streams
          with other tools.
    - The UNDERFLOW warnings are now made into info log messages
      to not spam the log too much. Many application just let
      things underrun and PulseAudio did not warn about this
      either. (#910)
  * ALSA plugin
    - The alsa plugin now uses the right metadata for finding the
      default source and sink, which makes the volume controls
      reappear. (#1384)
  * Other
    - Cleanups in pulse-server and pipewire.
    - Documentation additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 14:52:35 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Make the jack replacement libraries really replace jack libraries
  just like Fedora does (adding the path to the pipewire
  replacement libraries to ld.so.conf.d and conflicting with jack).
- Remove the spec code that forced the packages not to provide the
  jack libraries. They seem to be ready to replace jack libraries
  now.
- Add a pipewire-libjack-0_3-devel package with development files
  for pipewire's jack replacement.
- Enable the libcamera module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 29 06:12:36 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %pre and %post sections to the new media-session subpackage.
- Move the references to the media-session service from the
  workaround in pipewire's %post section to the workaround in the
  new subpackage's %post section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 28 16:14:29 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.31:
  * Highlights
    - Fixes for alsa-lib 1.2.5
    - New pulseaudio modules: module-avahi-zeroconf,
      module-pipe-source, module-roc-sink, module-roc-source
    - JACK has seen massive stability improvements. Locking
      and correctness wrt to callbacks and has been reworked. Also
      thread priorities have improved.
    - Handle various crashes and lockups when running out of file
      descriptors.
    - Bluetooth now uses a hardware database to disable
      non-working features on listed devices.
    - Scheduling quantum and rate can now be changed dynamically
      with pw-metadata.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Improve cleanup of context in error cases.
    - There is now a pw-test framework for improved unit tests.
    - Improve property serialization to valid JSON.
    - Fix some macros to work with better with coverity.
    - Metadata permissions are checked now. Clients need the
      M permission on an object to be able to set metadata for
      it.
    - The core metadata object will now remove metadata for
      removed objects, the implementor does not need to worry
      about that anymore.
    - Audioadapter will now follow the rate of the graph with
      the resampler adjusting itself dynamically.
    - Core now has a metadata implementation helper. A context
      will expose a metadata with settings that can be changed
      at runtime. This can be used to change the lowlevel or
      graph quantum and samplerate on the fly.
    - An infinite loop was fixed in the audio converter.
    - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully. Handle truncated
      control data by dropping the client connection.
    - Fix profiler crash with many streams.
    - Improve latency handling in pw-filter. There is now a
      default handler and a ProcessLatency parameter to simplify
      latency reporting.
    - Latency reporting was improved in devices and streams.
    - And example sink/source was added.
  * ALSA
    - hardware mute and volume are now properties on the
      Route param to make things easier.
    - More fixes for alsa-ucm 1.2.5.
  * Tools
    - spa-json-dump now properly encodes string and keys
    - pw-dump now shows the correct subject of the metadata.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Ensure the node.description is set, some applications
      crash otherwise (TeamSpeak).
    - Module loading and unloading was improved.
    - module-avahi-zeroconf was implemented.
    - module-pipe-source was implemented
    - module-roc-sink and module-roc-source was implemented
    - The maximum amount of connections has been limited to 64,
      like pulseaudio.
    - Handle out-of-fds more gracefully.
    - Fix overflow of read/write pointers.
    - source and sink state are now decoupled from the monitor
      state and will report IDLE when not playing anything.
  * media-session
    - Port switching should now happen to/from the port that
      actually changed.
  * JACK
    - The locking was reviewed. All callbacks are not emited
      from the PipeWire thread with the lock released and
      the process function will be disabled for the duration
      of the callback. This ensures that no two callbacks are
      called at the same time.
    - Improve internal consistency and try to never call callbacks
      with invalid objects.
    - Monitor port can now be accessed with system:monitor_%d
    - client threads are now created with SCHED_FIFO and module-rt
      is used to create the other RT threads. This should avoid
      SIGKILL from RTKit in some cases.
  * Bluetooth
    - Various bugfixes to improve connections to devices.
    - Handle delayed UUID connection.
    - There is now a hardware database that can disable features
      in listed devices.
    - Use libusb to detect availability of mSBC.
  * ALSA
    - The virtual device name can now also contain a media role.

- Add BuildRequires(libusb-1.0) to detect mSBC support for Bluetooth.
- Move media-session to a separate package (similar to Fedora),
  allowing to switch to another session manager.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 13 17:35:06 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- added pipewire-alsa to baselibs.conf
  pipewire-alsa-32bit is needed to run BIT.TRIP Runner 2 from Steam,
  which is a 32bit application and uses ALSA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 10 11:08:24 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Move %{_udevrulesdir}/90-pipewire-alsa.rules to the main pipewire
  package (boo#1187108)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 10 10:17:14 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.30+git~342ae0b64 (55 commits after 0.3.30) in order
  to include
  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/merge_requests/748
  and
  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/merge_requests/749
  to fix building on Leap 15.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  9 10:11:38 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

    - Recording from a monitor port should work again.
    - JACK applications should now be more stable again.
    - Freewheeling should not lock up anymore.
    - Fix lockups in many pulseaudio apps.
    - module-echo-cancel was implemented in pipewire-pulse
    - Many other stability fixes.
  * PipeWire

    - Improve logger formatting
  * PulseAudio server
    - Make sure to pass 64 bits values for time on ARM 32 bits to
      avoid protocol errors.
    - Avoid a crash when unloading module-combine-sink.
    - Avoid overflow in requested bytes, resulting in stalled
      audio.
    - Implement module-echo-cancel.
  * Bluetooth
    - Handle latency parameters instead of failing.
  * JACK
    - Fix locking in many places to avoid deadlocks and crashes.
    - Fix port rename.
    - Stop freewheeling correctly instead of deadlocking.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 13:01:45 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.29
  * Highlights
    - Latency reporting is now implemented.
    - Many documentation updates and cleanups.
    - module-combine-sink was added to PulseAudio server.
    - Better handling of multichannel input profiles.
    - Fix 100% volume issue when monitor suspends or profile
      changes in some cases.
    - Bugfixes and crashes
  * PipeWire
    - A new module-rt was added to acquire real-time scheduling
      priviledges without using RTKit.
    - Documentation fixes and updates. Docs are now using a
      custom theme.
    - There is now a MANDATORY flag on properties that influence
      how properties are filtered.
    - Filter-chain now parses the LADSPA_PATH correctly when it
      contains a colon separated list.
    - Move `#pipewire` IRC channel to oftc.net.
    - Fix an error where param changes were not emited in all
      cases.
    - Implement Latency reporting. Latency values are propagated
      through the graph so that each node knows the latency to
      the output/input device. Synchronization in pw-stream has
      been updated to use this.
    - Some more upmix cases are added so that LFE, SIDE and REAR
      can be generated from a mono channel as well.
    - pw-stream and pw-filter will now emit the process event from
      the real-time thread in a safe way, potentially avoiding some
      of the harder to debug crashes.
    - Fix potential stack overflow with serialize_dict.
    - Add PIPEWIRE_NO_CONFIG to run without custom config files.
    - The WebRTC echo canceler was added. Next versions will
      integrate this better.
  * PulseAudio server
    - module-combine-sink was implemented.
    - Fix some segfaults when DBus connections fail.
    - Support for listening on IPv6 was added.
    - Fix a bug where many flushes could result in requests for too
      much data from the client, causing sync, latency and garbled
      sound problems after many seeks.
  * ALSA
    - Also probe input paths for multichannel mappings. This makes
      multichannel input ports show up in more cases.
    - Fix headphones/front volume issue on some cards.
    - Fix max volume issue when profile changes.
    - Fix issue with UCM local config that was not available when
      the device was opened in the server but the UCM was opened by
      the session manager. Fixes alsa 1.2.5 compatibility.
  * JACK
    - Implement latency reporting with the new Latency params.
- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(webrtc-audio-processing)
  which is required by the new WebRTC echo canceler.
- Remove patch which is already included:
  * 0001-alsa-mixer-only-use-switch-to-mute-Front-in-the-Headphone-path.patch

- Add patch from upstream to use the independent switch to mute
  Lineout or Speaker instead of setting the volume, which on
  some soundcards might be shared by Headphone and Lineout or
  Headphone and Speaker (fixes boo#1186572):
  * 0001-alsa-mixer-only-use-switch-to-mute-Front-in-the-Headphone-path.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 25 07:12:32 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Introduce a workaround for systems where %systemd_user_post
  didn't enable the user services correctly due to different
  reasons . This workaround is only executed once, and only if
  it's really needed. In order to execute only once a lock file
  is created in /var/lib/pipewire. The lockfile can be removed
  when the workaround is removed.

  Everyone who upgraded their TW system between (aprox.) the 14th
  of January and the 16th of March and who didn't enable the
  services manually is affected by this. It also happens for
  everyone who installed a new TW system since (aprox.) the 14th
  of January and also for everyone doing a new installation of
  SLE15-SP3 / Leap 15.3 from the iso (new installations using
  online repositories will work fine once the fix in
  systemd-presets-common-SUSE is released).

  Fixes boo#1184852, boo#1183012 and boo#1186561.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 14:46:32 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.27
  * Highlights
    - Fix bug that caused bluetooth devices to stop working.
    - Fix session-manager crash when switching users caused by
      the DBus plugin cleanup errors.
    - Improve volume handling of monitor ports.
    - Fix GStreamer v4l2 support.
    - Implement module-remap-sink and module-remap-source in
      pipewire-pulse.
    - More fixes and improvements.
  * PipeWire
    - Move the loopback code into a module. Use this in pw-loopback
      and pipewire-pulse. Fix some cleanup crashes.
    - A dummy echo-cancel module was added. Later versions will
      include the webrtc echo-canceler.
    - State files don't have the X permission anymore.
    - Move i18n core into a private header file.
    - Stream can now advertize properties and receive property
      updates.
    - Fix an issue where the wrong index was used to address a port.
      It caused Bluetooth devices to stop working.
  * SPA plugins
    - Only do LFE filtering on channels we created.
    - Improve name and description of devices.
    - Improve cleanup in DBus connections and sources to avoid crash
      when destroying.
    - Improved volume handling. Hardware, Software and Monitor
      volumes are now properly separated and handled.
    - Support for S8 and S8P formats was added.
  * Tools
    - pw-cli can now also create Struct from JSON arrays.
  * Session-manager
    - The session manager can now also create passive links. This
      makes is possible to suspend effect chains together with the
      sinks when not in use.
    - Match rules now check the complete property value instead of
      only the start.
    - Handle multiple pending param enumerations, take only last
      result. This fixes some volume update issues.
  * GStreamer plugins
    - GStreamer plugins now advertize handling DMABUF explicitly. This
      is currently the only way to avoid a memcpy for v4l2 devices.
  * Device support
    - sync ACP with pulseaudio, merge upstream patch instead of our
      hack to workaround missing duplex devices.
    - V4l2 devices don't expose their fd anymore. Previously the fd
      and mmap offsets were passed to the client to access the buffer
      memory but that could create security issues.
  * Bluetooth
    - Don't unregister the profiles on shutdown because this can cause
      delay, just close the dbus connection.
    - Bluetooth devices now try to use the global samplerate from the
      graph.
  * PulseAudio server
    - Implement remap-sink and remap-source modules using the
      new loopback module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  3 03:06:31 UTC 2021 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Disable gstreamer device provider by now because the timestamp
  bug makes cheese video record abnormally longer than it should be
  (rh#1884260).
- Replace all tab characters to space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 29 11:16:51 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %systemd_ordering so systemd is installed before pipewire
  on fresh installations. This allows to set the service presets
  correctly on new systems since the %systemd_user_* macros don't
  do anything if systemd is not installed (boo#1185459).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 22 17:54:17 UTC 2021 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

      socket.
    - Added i18n support. Merge PulseAudio translations for the ACP
      library so that we don't cause regressions.
    - Support more than 19 channels in the channel mixer. This
      makes all channels usable on 32 and 64 channel cards.
    - Detect if we're running in a VM and allow for tweaking some
      settings such as the max-quantum to make things work better
      in VMs.
    - Fix a potential crash when connecting a client and updating
      permissions.
    - Fix a potential crash when trying to link incompatible ports.

      monitor, create and destroy links between them.
    - pw-cli can now also list params by name.
    - pw-dump now outputs Spa:String:JSON types in metadata as
      properly parsed and formatted JSON so that tools can parse
      the metadata values using a JSON parser.
  + Session-manager:
    - Add logind support. The bluetooth monitor can only be started
      for one user at the time, so use logind detect active seats.
    - ALSA icon names were improved to match what PulseAudio does.
    - Improve the bluetooth icon name. Also use the device alias as
      the device description, like PulseAudio.
  + Device support:

  + PulseAudio server:
    - Fix module-loopback connections to monitor ports.
    - Implement module-native-protocol-tcp.
    - Handle nodes and streams with > 32 channels. The PulseAudio
      API only supports up to 32 channels so only make those 32
      first channels available with the PA API.
    - Implement module-simple-protocol-tcp.
    - Improve events emitted by the server.
    - Improvements to channels and channel_map properties on
      modules. One can imply the other and they should match when
      both given.
    - null-sink will now have their volume work correctly by
      default.
  + JACK: JACK developement files can now optionally be installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 17:43:41 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Enable or disable the ldac codec depending if ldacBT is available
  or not to fix build in s390x (where it's not available)
- Add some more information and fix indentation on previous
  changelog entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 12:02:35 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.3.24:
  + This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible with
    previous 0.3.x releases.
  + Highlights
    - Many JACK midi improvements and device support.
    - Fixes in gnome-control-center default sink/source handling.
    - Many small performance improvements in alsa device handling
      and latency. There should also be less cracks/pops and xruns
      now.
    - More bluetooth compatibility improvements.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Implement simple upmixing
    - Disable the resampler when not used. This improves latency
      and CPU usage.
    - Handle max-quantum on devices and try to not make the quantum
      larger than the device buffer size.
    - improvements to how nodes and links are activated. It should
      now result in less xruns and cracks/pops.
    - meson uses the feature options everywhere now
    - Handle volume remap in the channelmixer. This fixes the
      channels on multichannel devices.
    - Try to escape invalid JSON string characters
    - Keep better track of changed parameters in audioconvert.
    - Improve config files, make arrays where needed.
    - Respect NO_COLOR where possible
    - Support in-place config file parsing to avoid allocations and
      improve startup performance.
    - There is no a config option to enable non-power-of-two
      quantums.
    - Preliminary support for upmixing and generating LFE channels.
  + Session-manager
    - default nodes are not stored as JSON in the metadata. This
      is more readable and introspectable.
    - More default-nodes and default-routes improvements. port
      switching should work better now.
    - Wait until all devices are scanned before linking clients.
    - Fixes some crashes
    - Sinks (monitors) can now be set as default sources.
  + Device support
    - Fix startup timers for alsa devices.
    - Improve timers in alsa when quantum changes. It should cause
      less xruns and cracks.
    - Fix UCM setup of capture devices.
    - Only disable IRQ in alsa when not batch. For batch devices
      the hw pointers are updated each IRQ so we need to keep them
      enabled. This massively improves latency on USB batch devices
      to the same level as JACK (with small enough period size).
  + Bluetooth
    - Improvements to profile switches.
    - Improvements to volume handling.
    - Fixes for A2DP sources
    - Add support for battery status when available.

      stream-restore to the new default. This fixes moving streams
      in gnome-control-center.
    - Fix some races by replying to some requests after the
      operation completed.
    - Prefer formats of the extended format API.
    - Create a pid file on startup to improve compatibility with

    - Move midi ports back to the midi client
    - Only mark midi hardware ports as terminal/physical
    - Use the same midi names as a2jmidid
    - match system ports in get_ports.
    - Improve compatibility with some apps that require a
      fixed latency.
    - Beginnings of the libjackserver implementation.
- Switch off libopenaptx and fdk-aac (because they are
  patent-encumbered) and libcamera (problems in building).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 17 17:15:02 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- systemd-rpm-macros doesn't have a consistent versioning between
  distributions, so better assume it's updated enough to support
  %systemd_user_pre

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 16 11:21:02 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add systemd rpm macros for pipewire.service as well as
  pipewire.socket .
- Use the new %systemd_user_pre macro on %pre to be able to
  recognize when a service was installed for the first time and
  enable it on %systemd_user_post (boo#1183012)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  9 16:46:52 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.23:
  + Highlights
    - Fixes for some critical bugs in last release.
    - Fix bug where audio was not drained properly at the end of
      playback, causing repeating sound.
    - Profile and route switching was improved and should mimic
      more what pulseaudio did.
    - Various fixes for xruns in capture and playback.
    - Bluetooth now supports delay adjustment and various other
      improvements.
    - The pulseaudio server now correctly identifies AC3 and DTS
      streams and returns a not supported error instead of playing
      static.
    - Multichannel support was improved in the alsa plugin and
      the channel mixer. Channels should now play on the right
      speakers in all cases.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Small fixes and improvements in JSON parsing and encoding.
    - Improvements to param handling in audioconverter. It would
      previously not always notify of changes.
    - Avoid updating some properties that we use internally such
      as the object id and the node.id.
    - log.level in the config files is now actually used.
    - the PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variable should always override
      any application settings in filter/stream/jack.
    - The config file can now contain filer and stream properties
      to, for example, control the resampler, mixer and latency.
    - Add sandboxing to the systemd services
    - Various FreeBSD fixes.
    - Improve draining and a way to exit the drain state as well.
    - Many multichannel fixes. Channel remapping should now be
      correct.
    - Fix bug with repeating audio at the end of playback because
      the drain in the resampler was not draining all channels.
    - RTKit default rt.prio has been increased to 88. This will
      likely still be clamped to 20 until distros increase the
      max priority.
  + Session-manager
    - Don't try to switch to Pro Audio profile, this should be
      a user choice only.
    - Don't crash when metadata was disabled such as when not
      using the audio features of pipewire.
    - Rework the profile and route handling.
    - Add systemd unit files for the media-session
    - Device names should now also have sane names so that tab
      pactl completion works on them.
  + Device support
    - Fix ALSA format enumeration in more cases. Use the channels
      and rate as a filter.
    - Make sure the graph doesn't ever use buffers larger than
      the alsa device buffer size or we get xruns.
    - Tuning of the alsa device timeout handling and dynamic
      resampler. There should now not be any xruns when streams
      appear and disappear or when the quantum changes.
    - Fix bug in alsa device when reassigning to a new driver,
      in some cases the dynamic resampler was not activated and
      things would drift out of sync and fail.
    - Fixes in quantum changes for ALSA capture and how the
      resampler is drained and fed with the new samples.
  + Bluetooth
    - Delay adjustment has been implemented now. Bluetooth
      devices should now be more synchronized with video due
      to proper delay reporting. Because BT delays can be
      large, it can cause hickups in some players.
    - Fix volume in bluetooth devices.
    - Codec switch improvements.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Latency offset adjustment is now implemented and functional
      for bluetooth devices. It is not working for alsa devices
      yet.
    - Handle unsupported formats. Previously we would accept encoded
      formats and play noise. This fixes AC3 playback in vlc.
    - Move some of the configurable parameters to the config file.
    - Fix a fatal use after free when playing samples
    - Improve module handling. loaded modules now show up in the
      list of modules and can be unloaded. This also prepares the
      core for more module implementations later.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Fix drain with very large buffers, we need to manually start
      the stream before draining.
    - Fix the channel layout handling.
    - Improve compatibility with apps that expect the poll to only
      return when there is activity.
    - Fix drain for capture
  + JACK
    - Add a config option to shorten and filter client names
    - Increase the length of the client name size and make sure
      we don't exceed the allocated size.
    - We now include our own jack header files so we can build
      without depending on another jack-devel package. We don't
      yet install the headers or provide pkgconfig files.
- Move alsa-card-profiles to modules subpackage, they are always
  needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  4 15:39:47 UTC 2021 - Niklas Haas <obs@haasn.xyz>

- Build/install the `pw-top` tool:
  + Add pkgconfig(ncurses) BuildRequires to satisfy the build deps
    of pw-top.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 11:10:46 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Do not provide pulseaudio, but pulseaudio-daemon so we can
  specify in the patterns that we prefer the pulseaudio package
  (boo#1182730)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 07:32:58 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.22:
  + Highlights
    - Per client config files replace the module-profiles. It's
      now possible to tweak settings and load custom modules.
    - Pro Audio card profile support. You can now select the
      Pro Audio profile and have raw device access with the
      maximum number of channels and no mixer controls. This is
      the usual setup for managing high end Pro Audio cards.
    - Many fixes and improvements in the JACK library to make
      devices look and integrate better.
    - Many bluetooth improvements. Playback should be more
      reliable and better synchronized. Support for the HFP HF
      profile.
    - Small fixes and improvements all over the map.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Add support for restrictions requested by a client. This
      makes it possible to implement Flatpak policy for emulated
      PulseAudio clients as well.
    - Fix removal of params in objects. Previously they would not
      be removed from the cache.
    - Remove mlock warnings by default. There is an option to
      enable them again if you want to check if your system is
      optimized.
    - Remove LimitMEMLOCK lines from the service files. They can
      only lower the system settings and are thus not useful.
    - Implement per-client config files. Each pipewire client will
      now read a config file that you can use to configure the
      context of the client.
    - Implement state and config load/save in pipewire. This is
      used by the session manager or other apps.
    - Make an option to disable dbus support.
    - Add tool to convert pipewire config to JSON.
  + Session-manager
    - Give all permissions to Manager flatpak apps. In the future
      we will use the Permission store to remember user settings.
    - Improvements to default audio/sink handling.
    - Add option to configure device suspend time.
    - Small fixes in route handling.
  + Device support
    - Complain when ACP profile files are not found and use
      a fallback in order to get something working.
    - Add volume support to monitor ports.
    - Fix resume from suspend for ALSA in more cases.
    - ALSA ACP cards now have a Pro Audio profile that exposes
      the raw card devices.
  + Bluetooth
    - Enable A2DP delay reporting. This improves audio/video sync
      when playing audio over bluetooth.
    - Fix stuttering in A2DP source
    - Tweak buffer size and latency settings to avoid stuttering
    - More work on HSP and HFP support
    - Fix initial profile configuration
    - Add HFP HF support
  + PulseAudio server
    - Small tweaks in capture packet size to avoid crashes in some
      apps.
    - Detect Flatpak apps and requests the flatpak permissions from
      the session manager. This means that Flatpak pulseaudio apps
      will now run with reduced permissions.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Reduce min buffer size in the plugin for lower possible
      latency.
  + JACK
    - implement some missing methods to make qjackctl work again.
    - Use the context data thread instead of making our own. This
      fixes the issue where the data thread was not given RT
      priority correctly.
    - Pass extra jack flags around in port properties. This makes
      CV ports in carla work.
    - Many tweaks to the port names and aliases. Unwanted
      characters are filtered out, giving better names to jack
      apps. Default device names are now equal to those seen in
      pulseaudio apps.
    - Add an option to make a separate client for the monitor
      ports of a device. This makes it more usable in apps.
    - add support for system:playback_N and system:capture_N port
      names for apps that hardcode these port names.

Wed Feb 24 11:29:58 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Re-add the Provides: pulseaudio; patterns-base now suggests
  pulseaudio, which should help zypp in doing a smarter decision
  (boo#1182730).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 09:30:54 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- ldacBT only builds on little endian architectures, so we can't
  buildrequire it on big endian systems like s390, s390x or ppc64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 17:02:06 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dleuenberger@suse.com>

- Remove the pulseaudio provides from pipewire-pulseaudio:
  We first need to ensure our KDE patterns (and others) become
  smart enough to favor pulseaudio until we are ready for the
  switch (boo#1182730).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 17:02:31 UTC 2021 - Dominik Schmidt <dev@dominik-schmidt.de>

- Update to version 0.3.21:
  + Highlights
    - Many PulseAudio compatibility fixes. Handling of corked
      streams, the prebuf setting, seek modes and stream flags
      are now implemented correctly.
    - Ports and Profiles are now managed by the session manager
      and can save and restore previous settings.
      ALSA device handling has been tweaked for maximum
      compatibility at the expense of latency. There are tuning
      options in the config file.
    - Improved Bluetooth support. HSP is disabled by default
      because it is old and deprecated and in some cases causes
      conflicts with the newer HFP profile. Codec switching is
      now implemented as well.
      PipeWire accepts donations with liberapay now.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Improve draining in pw-stream.
      pw-stream now uses busy metadata by default. This makes sure
      that no writer can write to buffers when readers are still
      busy.
    - Fix handling of empty array/choice instead of failing.
    - Fix crashes when creating properties from empty strings.
    - Make it possible to pass an array to module-access
      access.allowed variables
    - Fix small bug in argument parsing in pw-cat
  + Session-manager
    - Restore route volumes in all cases, also when switching
      routes.
    - Use a default route volume for unknown routes instead of
      letting the system decide on a default.
      Improve profile handling. Don't try to restore unavailable
      profiles. Implement the profile switching in the session
      manager now.
    - Fix handling of Virtual sources as defaults.
    - Handle port switching in the session manager. Implement
      save and restore of default ports per profile.
  + GStreamer
    - Fix a crash with zero SPA_PARAM_BUFFERS_size
  + Device support
    - v4l2-source will now respect the requested memory types.
    - ALSA buffering has been tweaked. USB devices should have
      less XRuns by default. Parameters can be tweaked to
      decrease the latency on capable devices. Also fix a case
      where a quantum change would cause an xrun.
    - Fix mute in bluetooth devices
      bluetooth devices are not paused in idle anymore for
      improved compatibility.
    - Codec switching for bluetooth is implemented along with
      config options to select the codecs manually.
    - HSP for bluetooth is now disabled by default. Most devices
      support the newer HFP profile and some devices fail when
      both are available.
    - Reduce the amount of events the ALSA plugins emit by bundling
      them.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Implement the suspend command
    - Fixes volume in sample info
    - Fix playback of samples, sometimes samples would be clipped
      short. Also implement the target sink for the sample.
    - Use rate match to feed samples. This way the latency can
      be kept to a minimum.
    - Latency has been tuned some more, more closely emulating
      pulseaudio behaviour.
    - Improve default sink/source handling. Make sure all events
      are sent correctly when defaults change.
    - Handle underrun better without causing sync issues. Make sure
      to pause in corked state.
    - Implement rewind due to seeks, fixes GStreamer seeking.
- Do not remove alsa-card-profiles, they are required

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 15:32:37 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Provide pulseaudio by pipewire-pulseaudio: there are various
  packages in the distro that require pulseaudio, but essentially,
  they should be happy with pipewire-pulseaudio as a replacement.
  Do not provide the symbol though, as we do not (yet) want to
  automatically migrate users over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 12:12:43 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add pkgconfig(ldacBT-abr) and pkgconfig(ldacBT-enc)
  BuildRequires: Build bluetooth ldac codec support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 15:50:31 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.20:
  + Highlights
    - Latency was reduced in ALSA and PulseAudio and time
      reporting has improved a lot.
    - Bluetooth now has a native HFP backed, SBC XQ and
      mSBC support.
    - Many bugfixes and improvements, improved device
      support.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - pw-dump can now dump all objects such as Endpoints
    - pw-dump has a -m option to monitor changes
    - pw-dump can now dump metadata
    - pw-stream can now use the rate-match io to exactly
      produce the required number of samples for the
      current cycle. When using this feature, a stream can
      achieve the same low-latency as pw-filter.
    - spa-acp-tool can now load a custom profile-set and
      correctly parses the volume updates
    - There is now a nofail option when loading modules
    - The connection has been made reentrant to fix some
      strange random problems with metadata.
    - Turn some errors into warnings or simply info.
    - Executables are now built with PIE

      a config option.
  + Session-manager
    - There are now config files for bluez and v4l2 modules
    - Improve ALSA device and node properties
    - Bluetooth devices have better properties now.
    - The default device routing has been improved.
  + Device support
    - Port priorities are updated for UCM devices
    - ACP devices notify change in routes in all cases
    - There is now RW support in ALSA devices to increase
      compatibility.
    - Many improvements to Bluetooth. SBC XQ support can now
      be enabled with a config option. mSBC can be enabled
      with an option.
    - Bluetooth devices not expose Routes so that they look
      more like how PulseAudio handles them
    - Gracefully handle missing profile-sets
    - There is now a native HFP backend
    - Improve card names in some cases.
    - pause-on-idle is now disabled for ALSA devices. This can
      reduce pops and clicks when the device is stopped.
  + ALSA plugin
    - Use rate-match to reduce the latency
    - Implement a _delay() function to get smoother timestamps.
    - Fix property parsing. Fixes volume changes in alsamixer.
  + PulseAudio server
    - Use rate-match to reduce the latency. This also reduces
      the buffering in audioconvert and improves timestamp
      reporting.
    - Implement rate changes now that we have rate-match
      support.
    - pactl stats will now work
    - Fix excessive memory usage when a capture client doesn't
      read fast enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 13 09:07:19 UTC 2021 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.19:
  + Highlights
    - Startup after login should be fixed now with inotify
      used to wait for permissions.
    - Channels should be mapped correctly now.
    - Many bluetooth improvements in LDAC, AptX-HD. AAC was
      also added. Headsets should work better now.
    - pipewire-libpulse was removed. It is now completely
      replaced by pipewire-pulse.
    - Fix a crasher bug in pipewire-pulse and some memory leaks.
    - Fix a bug with feedback loop that would cause 100% CPU.
    - A new pw-top tool to display real-time graph performance.
    - The example session manager now has config files.
    - The config file format was changed to use the SPA JSON
      tokenizer. This makes it more flexible and extensible.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Fix debug of id in format channels
    - Audioconvert should now remap channels correctly in all
      cases.
    - Feedback loops were not scheduled correctly and would
      cause 100% CPU usage.
    - Small improvements to the profiler to also log incomplete
      graph status.
    - a new tool pw-top was added that prints real-time performance
      stats of the graph.
    - the rtkit module now sets the nice level to -11
  + Session-manager
    - The session manager would sometimes link dont-reconnect
      nodes to another node, which would leak monitor streams in
     pipewire-pulse.
    - The session manager now has configuration files. Config files
      can also be placed in the user home directory to make custom
      configurations.
    - The session managers now creates unique device and node
      names for alsa and v4l2 devices.
  + Device support
    - Many improvements in Bluetooth codecs, LDAC stuttering,
      AptX-HD negotiation, LDAC ABR support
    - Bluetooth supports AAC audio now.
    - Many fixes to Bluetooth SCO transport used in headsets.
    - inotify support in device monitors
    - ACP was synced with the latest pulseaudio code
    - Fix a bug in enumeration of device ports.
  - PulseAudio server
    - seek flags and offset are now supported, making gstreamer
      pulse elements work better.
    - Fix a crasher bug in pipewire-pulse, we sometimes would
      write too much to the ringbuffer
    - Fix some memory leaks in error cases.
    - Fix handling of NULL string to locate default sink/source
  + JACK layer
    - Ports can also be found with the aliases now, making
      qjackctl work in more cases.
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.18:
  + Highlights
    - More work in the PulseAudio server. It should be compatible
      with more applications.
    - Bluetooth now support extra codecs such as AptX/HD and LDAC.
    - Support for virtual sources and sink was improved a lot.
    - Added a new pw-dump tool to dump the objects in JSON formats
      and for filtering them with tools like jq.
    - Many more stability fixes and improvements.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Silence some harmless warnings
    - pw-cli can now be used to set parameters.
    - Streams now perform the correct channel mapping when linked
      to non-standard multichannel devices. Previously channels
      would get swapped.
    - port, node and device params are now cached in the server.
      This avoids opening and closing devices whenever some client
      enumerates formats, which improves performance a lot,
      especially in cases where opening a device is slow.
    - Add a command to keep a device open during negotiation. This
      is used to enumerate and set a format while opening the
      device just once, improving performance.
    - The null-sink scheduling was fixed.
    - A memory corruption bug was fixed in format conversion, this
      could cause crashes, silent channels or other undefined
      behaviour.
    - There is now a simple JSON parser.
  + Session-manager
    - Settings files are now stored in JSON. With the json parser
      this is easier to parse and extend
  + Device support
    - Bluetooth now supports additional codecs: LDAC, AptX and
      AptX HD. LDAC is known to not work very well yet.
    - ALSA devices will now default to the max supported channels
      if nothing else is specified. This makes it possible to use
      8+ channel cards with the alsa-pcm module, which is not
      supported with the default alsa-acp module.
    - Enable mSBC support in oFono.
    - Add an option to disable hardware mixers
    - ALSA now improves support for batch devices.
    - The udev rules had references to Pulseaudio removed in order
      to not create conflicts.
    - Fix a potential crash in bluetooth devices when
      disconnecting.
    - UCM cards now use HW volume when possible.
  + PulseAudio server
    - The id can now be used as the name to locate cards and
      devices
    - Report streams with planar formats as well
    - Better error reporting when stream create fails
    - module-null-sink can now handle channels, rate and
      channel_map properties
    - Add support for 3 types of virtual devices: source,
      sink and duplex.
    - set-port was fixed
    - Some buffer parameters were tweaked to improve
      performance, compatibility and stuttering with lower
      latency.
    - NULL can be used as a name for the device sink/source
    - Support lookup of monitor names
    - Set properties more like pulseaudio so that some
      clients (Teamspeak) don't crash anymore
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.17:
  + Highlights
    - Fix crasher bug for kwin when screensharing stopped.
    - Massive improvements and compatibility fixes in the
      PulseAudio server.
    - The session manager now has a config directory in
      /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ It will look for files there
      to activate session manager modules. Packagers can use
      this to only activate the audio modules when the PulseAudio
      server, libjack.so or the alsa modules are installed.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - We now clear hooks before adding them. Some application
      did not clear them and had random data for the destroy
      callback.
    - Return -ENOENT from unknown resources so apps can handle
      this better. It's a common problem when an app tries to
      introspect and object but it disappeared before the message
      reached the server. Apps should ignore this.
    - channelmap information is now passed with the volume
    settings.
    - DMABuf is not mmapp()ed anymore with the FLAG_MAP_BUFFERS in
      the stream or filter. This is because DMABuf usually
      requires more that just a simple mmap and is better left
      for the application.
    - increase the maximum number of ports for a client-node.
    - adapter and node-factory now support the linger option to
      keep the objects alive after the creating client disconnected.
  + Device support
    - ALSA now handles error in close(), like when unplugging a
      USB device.
  + Session-manager
    - The session manager is now handling DONT_RECONNECT streams
      without a target node. They get connected to a default node
      once and then fail to reconnect.
    - The session manager now exposes the stream setting as
      metadata. This makes it possible for other components, such
      as pulse-server to use this information. Information is stored
      as a json object for easier consumption.
    - The session manager now has a config directory in
      /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ packagers can use this
  + PulseAudio server
    - Pulse server now acquire the dbus name.
    - Improvements in timing and compatibility with many apps.
    - The stream-restore extension is now implemented so that
      the event volume can be configured.
    - Many stability fixes and improvements.
    - Fix some issues with module-load/unload
- Changes from PipeWire 0.3.16:
  + Highlights
    - Fix screensharing for old 0.2 clients
    - Many pulse-server improvements. There is now a
      pipewire-pulse binary that is the prefered solution for
      PulseAudio compatibility. The replacement libpulse
      libraries are now deprecated. This also makes audio in
      Flatpak work.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Fix cleanup of listeners everywhere. Force remove of
      listeners in _destroy to avoid crashes.
    - Add support for a journald logger module.
    - Various memory leak fixes
    - Silence some warnings that spammed the logs.
    - Fix flush in pw_stream. This fixes small glitches when
      switching streams in music players.
    - Various FreeBSD fixes and improvements.
    - Fix some crashes when destroying objects.
  + Device support
    - Reload the ALSA configuration when creating a node so that
      hotplugged devices work in all cases.
    - Fix memory leaks in ACP library. This also fixes issues
      where the mixer device was not closed.
    - Bluetooth now has support for the mSBC codec for SCO
      source and sink.
  + pulse-server
    - Many introspection and compatibility improvements. It should
      now be as good or better than the replacement library.
    - Implement sample cache to make notification events work.
  + JACK layer
    - handle errors when linking, fixes jack_connect hang when
      the ports were already linked.
- Drop patches do-not-use-snd_pcm_ioplug_hw_avail.patch and
  fix-memfd_create-call.patch, no longer needed on SLE/Leap which
  have updated glibc / alsa.
- Drop do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch, remove files at
  install time instead.
- pw-pulse wrapper is gone, remove all mentions of it.
- Package pulseaudio replacement in a subpackage and drop
  pipewire-libpulse-0_3 (pipewire will use pulseaudio libraries
  directly).
- Create an alsa subpackage and move alsa pipewire plugin to this
  subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 10:37:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.15:
  + Highlights
    - This is a quick update to fix critical issues with the
      0.3.14 update, which broke screen sharing and accidentally
      enabled the experimental pulse-server.
    - Fix some compatibility issues in pulse-server with
      pavucontrol and fix an issue that would block the complete
      server.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Permission checks for new clients are now done from a
      global context, which makes it possible to assign initial
      permissions to objects.
    - Handle EINTR everywhere
    - Fix an issue with the node state changes where a quick
      pause/play would hang a client.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Disable the bluez5 and pulse-bridge modules by default
      because they interfere with pulseaudio. These options should
      only be enabled if pulseaudio is removed or disabled in the
      system.
    - Fix an issue where the session manager could end up in
      infinite recursion while scanning for things to do.
    - The session manager will now always configure nodes to remix
      to the channel configuration of the device. This fixes the
      case where mono streams would only end up on one channel of a
      stereo device.
  + Device support
    - Initial merge of A2DP extra codec support using the new
      bluez5 API.
  + pulse-server
    - Create the runtime directory when it doesn't exist.
    - Don't ever block the server, use non-blocking IO everywhere.
    - Fill description of profiles with the name if not otherwise
      set, this fixes a crash in pavucontrol.
    - the connection debug catergory will now also debug pulse
      messages.
    - Respect the no_remix flag to make the control panel channel
      check work.
  + ALSA plugin
    - implement pause

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 08:11:46 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.14:
  + Highlights
    - This release focuses on bugfixes and stability
      improvements.
    - A new experimental pulse-server module was added. This
      module implements the pulseaudio protocol on top of
      PipeWire and can be used to make flatpaks work with
      PipeWire. It looks like this might be a better way
      forward compared to the libpulse.so replacement library.
    - A2DP bluetooth was reworked. Playback should work a lot
      better now. Support was also added to automatically link
      an A2DP source to a playback device, which makes it possible
      to use PipeWire as a bluetooth receiver as well.
    - Improvements to the routing and volume restore features
      of the session manager.
  + PipeWire improvements
    - The channelmixer does not normalize volumes anymore. Volumes
      are only normalized for monitoring streams now.
    - Streams can actually start in the inactive state now.
    - The channelmixer can now also convert volume updates from one
      channel layout to another. This makes saved volumes work
      even when streams have different channel layouts.
    - Clients are only registered after the properties have been
      updated.
    - Links now have a new active state.
    - Drivers can now also specify a minimum quantum. This makes it
      possible for bluetooth devices to specify an optimum quantum
      for the given codec settings and MTU.
    - The amount of data sent over the socket was reduced by only
      sending the data that changed.
    - Client objects are now exposed after they uploaded their
      properties, which makes the new object more useful.
  + Tools improvements
    - pw-cat will now add metadata to the PipeWire streams.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Fix crashes when reading bad data in stored settings.
    - volume and routing is improved. Settings are now remembered
      per application or media-role.
    - The session manager remembers the last device used per stream
    - Fix a bug when moving streams where it could sometimes end
      up with linking a stream to multiple devices.
    - Use RTKit to set realtime priority on the data thread in the
      session manager. This improves performance of the pulse-server
      and bluetooth devices.
    - Add a new property to mark streams that want to capture from
      the monitor of the default sink.
    - NODE_TARGET can now also contain the node name. This avoids
      some lookups in the pulseaudio layer when selecting target
      nodes by name.
    - the -e and -d options are more usable now and can be used to
      add and remove modules from the default list of modules.
  + Device support
    - v4l2: add some workarounds for buggy drivers. Add Limited
      support for droidcam.
    - ACP: improve selection of default port and profiles.
    - ACP: add support for using the hardware mixer for more than
      8 channel streams.
    - ACP: support the new port type and availability group found
      in PulseAudio.
    - A2DP bluetooth timings were reworked. Automatic linking of
      A2DP sources was added to make it possible for PipeWire to
      act as a bluetooth receiver. The code was reworked to allow
      other codecs such as APTX and LDAC in the future.
    - Try harder to recover from ALSA errors.
  + GStreamer improvements
    - Fix some crashes in the monitor that cause
      gnome-initial-setup to crash.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Many compatibility improvements. Improved playback in
      chrome. Fix a crash in firefox when the daemon is stopped.
    - Fix a leak in the formats.
    - Fix !ADJUST_LATENCY streams like paplay.
    - Make the device option in paplay work.
    - Fix volume/mute notifications, this makes plasma volume updates
      work again.
    - Do the conversion between PulseAudio cubic volumes and PipeWire
      linear volumes. Volume levels should behave now like they did
      with PulseAudio.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - Return an error when we run out of midi events. Some application
      rely on this behaviour.
  + ALSA plugin improvements
    - The ALSA plugin now also supports the node name in the
      playback_node and capture_node properties.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 27 17:32:57 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Rename 99-pipewire-default.conf to
  99-pipewire-default.conf.example so it's disabled by default and
  all ALSA I/O doesn't get redirected to pipewire (which was only
  overrided by pulseaudio's configuration in alsa-plugins-pulse
  casually). Thanks to Takashi Iwai for noticing (boo#1178104,
  boo#1177166 and probably boo#1175584)
- Add baselibs.conf (boo#1177555)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 08:29:36 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.13:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Add pw-reserve tool to reserve or monitor a device on DBus.
    - Install spa-resample, a tool to resample a file.
    - Install spa-acp-tool, a tool to inspect the card profile.
    - Various fixes and improvements
    - Fix a bug in pw-stream where a capture stream could run out
      of buffers and become silent.
    - Rework the processing loops in the adapter and stream. There
      is now less latency in PulseAudio and ALSA layers.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Improve the device reservation code. We now try to acquire
      the device using the dbus device reservation API before we
      probe the device. This avoids conflicts with a running
      PulseAudio where devices would disappear (because they were
      locked by the other process).
    - Don't fail on invalid input from the config files.
    - Audio devices now have the same name as what PulseAudio
      would assign.
  + Device support
    - v4l2: try to use the format before enumerating the size and
      framerate. Some drivers don't check the format and might now
      work better.
    - v4l2: Fall back to MMAP when EXPBUF fails. Fix MMAP access,
      just export the fd and the mapoffset. This should make more
      devices work.
    - Fix crash in ALSA Card Profile (ACP) code.
    - ACP: fix selection of default profile. Prefer any possibly
      available profile over 'Off'. This makes some card at least
      start with something.
    - Fix soft volume. After setting the volume to 0, it would stay
      at 0 until pushed over the max volume. This should fix
      various volume related issues.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Rework the buffering and latency measurements and tweak the
      buffer attributes. This should make browsers and media
      players work better. This should also improve speechd
      performance.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - Fix compilation against newer JACK.

- Rebase patch:
  + do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 22 12:37:18 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.12:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - The channelmap converter now handles unknown and strange
      channel layouts much better.
    - The resampler is now cleared correctly, avoiding clicks and
      pops at the start of sound.
    - Fixes for various crasher bugs. (paplay drain, vlc shutdown,
      pactl info, ...)
    - Fix a race condition in the node state changes that caused
      all kinds of sync and other issues (vlc, mpv, ...)
    - Improve the binary name property of applications
    - Fix the scheduling again of nodes that always need a driver
      such as the jack clients.
  + Session manager improvements
    - Fix routing to default nodes. Sometimes nodes were not routed
      to the default node (bluetooth)
  + Device support
    - Disable channelmap from ALSA by default. This is what
      PulseAudio does and thus provides better compatibility.
    - Fix a bug in how the resampler was used in the ALSA source,
      causing distortion and errors when using low latency capture
      clients. (Discord, webrtc, ...)
    - Small bluetooth improvements. More work is needed for
      reliable bluetooth playback.
  + GStreamer plugins
    - The device provider now stops the processing loop before
      shutting down, which avoids crashes (gnome-initial-setup).
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - The buffer attributes were reworked to ensure compatibility
      with many more applications such as mpv and audacious.
    - The pulseaudio layer will now try hard to not hand out
      invalid channel maps to the application. (avoids crashes in
      gnome-volume-control). The channel map will now also look
      more like what PulseAudio does.
    - The @DEFAULT_SINK/SOURCE/MONITOR@ wildcards now work. This
      fixes the problem with volume keys when they are bound to
      scripts using pactl and the default sink/source wildcards.
    - The PIPEWIRE_LATENCY environment variable now works again
    - Fix some leaks of ports and port info. Also fix the leak of
      the context when the mainloop is stopped.
    - The sink/source format_info array is now filled up
      completely, this is actually not implemented yet in the real
      PulseAudio.
  + JACK layer improvements
    - jack now returns version 3.0.0 and has PipeWire in the
      version string so that apps can report this.
- Drop patch:
  + 0001-alsa-dont-change-the-resampler-delay-value.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 05:32:09 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.11:
  + PipeWire improvements
    - Properly cleanup the mixer structures when a port is removed,
      this should fix client crashes related to port config changes
      and other random crashes.
    - Optimize the preferred formats in the audio converter. Higher
      quality formats with higher performance are chosen first.
    - Make sure the time reported by pw_stream is always
      increasing, even when the driver and clock changes.
    - There is now also a system service and socket that can be
      used to enable PipeWire systemwide. This is however not
      recommended and disabled by default.
    - Fix channelmixer 5.1 to stereo mix matrix. It was not reading
      the conversion matrix correctly and cause channels to be
      dropped. The channelmixer will now also normalize the volume,
      like what pulseaudio does.
    - The channelmixer will now just copy channels when no layout
      has been given. It has also optimized paths for this. This
      makes it possible for apps to request > 8 channels from the
      alsa plugin (ardour).
    - Port, Node and Link will now also emit an error on the
      resources in addition to updating the error in the info. This
      would make it easier to track negotiation errors in the
      session manager later.
    - many small fixes and cleanups.
    - Fix compatibility:
      - DOSBox: fix crash because of double free in pw_stream
  + Session manager improvements
    - The session manager will now try to configure the client to
      the channel configuration of the sink/source. It will only
      do this for downmixing, never for upmixing and also never
      when the client has the dont-remix property set. It will
      also renegotiate the channel layout when moving a stream to
      a new sink/source.
    - Configuration state is now saved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
      Previously it was saved in $HOME/.pipewire-media-session/
      You can migrate the state by moving the files to
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire-media-session (or
      $HOME/.config/pipewire-media-session as a fallback when
      XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).
  + Device support
    - Bluetooth sources and sinks should work better now.
    - There is now also a new bluetooth backend using hsphfpd.
    - fix the ALSA UCM Off profile for alsa pcm devices
    - improve ALSA port and profile switching. The ACP device will
      now switch to the best port and profile when availability
      changes.
  + PulseAudio layer improvements
    - Implement some more callbacks. The pulse layer will now also
      notify applications of stream moved, started and latency
      changes.
    - Fix error code when an object was not found. We now return
      PA_ERR_NOENTITY instead of PA_ERR_INVALID.
    - Add some support for loading new null sinks. Applications
      such as pulseeffects use this. Note that pulseeffects does
      not yet work reliably but can start now.
    - Improve handling of profile and port updates, it should work
      much more reliable now. Apps should now also again receive
      volume updates from sinks/sources.
    - Fix compatibility:
  	- openal-soft 1.20
  	- pavucontrol (checks PA_ERR_NOENTITY)
  + JACK layer improvements
    - improve default source and sink handling. It was not updated
      correctly in all cases.
    - add samplerate and period to the pw-jack wrapper to easily
      configure the desired samplerate and perdiod for the app.
  + ALSA plugin improvements
    - Add a mixer entry in the alsa config file.
    - Implement support for planar types, rework the processing
      function to make it more robust.
    - refuse to load the alsa plugin when linked against 0.2. This
      catches some old apps linked against 0.2 that want to use the
      alsa plugin.
    - Fix compatibility:
      - linphone (ALSA SIGFPE when _status() is called
        before _prepare()).
- Includes fix for a division by 0 error (boo#1176515):
  + 0021-alsa-protect-against-SIGPFE.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix audio stutters in discord and probably
  other applications when using alsa directly.
  + 0001-alsa-dont-change-the-resampler-delay-value.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 27 06:00:06 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.10:
  + Many improvements to the pulse layer.
    - GStreamer pulsesink element now works.
    - Fixes some segfaults.
    - Enable rtkit for client threads.
    - fixes capture of monitor stream by name
    - implement some more extensions, this makes paman
      work and removes some warnings.
  + Many improvements to the GStreamer elements
    - negotiation rework, avoid calling GStreamer methods from
      the PipeWire callbacks because they might block and cause
      deadlocks.
    - Add support for non-string property values.
    - improve stability after buffer and format
      renegotiation.
    - Rework the device provider.
    - pipewiresink can now provide a stream that can
      be consumed by apps like cheese.
  + Many improvements to the JACK layer:
    - Rework the buffer_size callbacks. Make sure we call
      the callback from a 'safe' thread and that we don't
      call the process callback while the application is
      handling the callback. This improves stability in
      apps like Carla when PipeWire dynamically changes
      the buffer size.
    - Improve compatibility with apps that call
      get_buffer_frames() with a 0 size (calfjackrack)
    - JACK can now create nodes that can be set as a
      sink/source in PulseAudio/ALSA apps (you can make an
      effects rack and set that as default sink for
      apps).
  + Added a group id property for nodes. This makes it
    possible to schedule nodes with the same driver even
    when they are otherwise not linked together. To make
    this work well a new flag needed to be added to nodes
    to signal when they are ready for processing.
    Together with the GStreamer fixes, this makes things
    like:
     gst-launch-1.0 -v pipewiresrc path=51 stream-properties="props,node.group=1" !
           audio/x-raw ! pipewiresink stream-properties="props,node.group=1"
    work as expected with PipeWire managing the resampling
    to keep the clocks of the devices in sync.
    This can later also be used to force devices to be grouped
    together to create a JACK-like scheduling group.
  + Streams and filter now use PIPEWIRE_NODE and
    PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variables as fallback.
  + ACP add per device port list. This makes UCM devices
    expose the right ports.
  + Fix some segfaults in ACP and UCM.
  + make pw-cat use the metadata to find default devices.
  + The media session can now save and load audio device
    Profiles and Routes (volumes), stream volumes and
    the default sink and sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 13 11:28:16 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.9:
  + Fix bad audio in chrome
  + Remove some errors that are not real errors.
  + Fix 100% cpu when disconnecting devices.
  + Improve pulseaudio introspection of formats
  + Fix JACK metadata handling, carla can now monitor the
    port it creates and insert midi.
  + Add a new permission bit (M) that is needed to be able
    to configure metadata on an object. Improve security of
    metadata some more, only allow metadata on objects that
    are visible to the client setting the metadata.
  + Add support for videocrop in the GStreamer elements.
  + Improve handling of the runtime directory for the
    server sockets. Add some reasonable fallback when
    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set, as suggested in the spec.
  + Improve ALSA device names from ACP.
  + Fix various crasher bugs. One in the pulse layer, one in
    the session manager.
  + Make alsa plugin respect the PIPEWIRE_REMOTE env variable.
  + Various compile fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 07:50:45 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.8:
  + Fix an embarrassing crasher in the JACK layer when metadata
    keys were removed.
  + Make it possible to add properties to jack clients with a
    PIPEWIRE_PROPS env variable. This can be used to make JACK
    nodes look like a device (like an effects rack).
  + Improvements in the session manager in how it links ports.
    Now it will try to link matching channels first and be more
    intelligent otherwise. The session manager will also configure
    the stream to the device port configuration when needed.
  + Add ofono backend for Bluetooth HeadSet support.
  + Improve default source and sink handling. They are now stored
    with their id, instead of name, in the metadata. This makes it
    work better with JACK because of JACK's limited name length.
  + Improve environment variables to make it possible to create
    and connect to servers other than "pipewire-0". Implement
    this in pulseaudio, JACK and alsa layers.
  + Add an alsa mixer plugin so that alsamixer works with PipeWire.
    It will configure the default source/sink volumes.
  + Fix capture devices. There was something wrong with how the
    resampler was used that caused corruption in the signal when
    the resampler was active.
  + We now ship alsa card paths, profile-sets configuration files
    and udev rules so that we don't have to rely on the pulseaudio
    ones.
  + Many build and stability fixes.

- Update to version 0.3.7:
  + Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
    code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
    all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
    mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
    be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
    in how it presents and manages devices.
    Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
    and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
    it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
    compatibility layer for those who want to try.
  + Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
    pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
    the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
    screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
    still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
    elements can now also share a connection between them.
  + Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
    and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
    fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.
  + Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
    where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
    memory.
  + Support for passive links is added again. These are links
    that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
    This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
    to suspend as a group when not in use.
  + Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
    the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
    to how links and node states were handled. More work is
    needed to implement more use cases.
  + Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
    was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
    in reuse of the wrong memory.
  + Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.
  + Improved error handling in the session manager.
  + Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
    sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
    to the default device. Changing the default device will
    move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
    respect the default source/sinks.
  + Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
    a stream and the session manager will move streams when
    the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
    implement the move_stream feature.
  + Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
    has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
    apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
    objects. Security related properties are made read-only
    now. Different access modules can now coexist.
  + The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
    - a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
    - a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.

  modified in every package update:
  + fix-meson-required-version.patch
- Add patch to not install alsa card paths, profile-sets
  configuration files and udev rules which upstream installs
  "so that we don't have to rely on the pulseaudio ones".
  + do-not-install-alsa-config-files.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 15 07:26:01 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Recommend pipewire from libpipewire, so if the library is
  installed the daemon gets pulled in since we want a daemon
  to connect to.
- Require pipewire-spa-plugins from pipewire instead of
  recommending it since the support plugin is actually required
  for most uses (like screen sharing in wayland, which we want to
  support out-of-the-box).
- Enable the pipewire.socket systemd user service in %post
  (using pulseaudio's %post section as an example of how to do it
  since systemd-presets-common-SUSE currently lacks support for
  user services). Also disable it in %preun and %postun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 08:25:49 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

    A big leak in screen sharing with DMA-BUF was fixed.
  + Compile fixes
  + Stability improvements in jack and pulseaudio layers.
  + Added the old portal module to make the Camera portal
    work again. This will be moved to the session manager in
    future versions.
  + Improvements to the GStreamer source and sink shutdown.
  + Fix compatibility with v2 clients again when negotiating
    buffers.
- Disable vulkan if the vulkan package is too old (as in
  SLE 15 SP0 and SP1)
- Add patch to build with meson >= 0.46.0 since 0.50.0 is not
  really needed:
  + fix-meson-required-version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Fix linked sink/source in pulseaudio
  + ratelimit graph processing warnings
  + improve buffer handling in GStreamer elements
  + Fix power usage by removing the queue for the alsa
    sequencer system announce messages.
  + Fix metadata clear() method dispatch.
  + Improve parameter enumeration, make it possible to detect
    missing parameters vs no-compatible parameters so that we
    can use defaults in the first case and error in the second
    case.
  + Fix cleanup of proxy objects. Stability improvements on
    plug/unplug in session manager.
  + Make it possible to set log level from config file
  + improve debug of param negotiation errors. Log the

  needed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 10:48:28 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.2:
  + build fixes
  + Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
    possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
    and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
    format.
  + Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
  + Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
    to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
    negotiate.
  + Fix JACK midi output.
  + Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
    AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
  + Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
    shader.
  + Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
    processing and use the values from the processing
    context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
  + Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
    config file.
  + Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
    cause the server to leak all buffers.
  + Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
  + Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
  + Try to select higher quality formats first when
    negotiating a format with an audio device.
  + Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
  + Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
    do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
    pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
    default and has options to select a different server.
  + Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
    samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.

Mon Mar  9 16:11:08 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.3.1:
  + This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
    with previous 0.3.x releases.
  + Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
    sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
    Only enable this for the jack library for now.
  + Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
    signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
    the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
  + Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
  + improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
    warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
    started the operation or is the owner of the object.
  + pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
    in verbose mode
  + fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
  + Fix and update some examples
  + jack: check arguments and don't crash when invalid
  + Fix buffer memory upload.
  + jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
    install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
    handling.
  + fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
  + add support for control ports in pw_filter
  + fix cleanup of the metadata module
  + improve param enumeration.
  + Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
  + Add create-object command in the config file to create
    object from a factory.
  + Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
    nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
  + Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
    about a boolean.
  + pulseaudio: improve compatibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 15:13:15 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch to build correctly with glibc < 2.27 (like in SLE/Leap):
  + fix-memfd_create-call.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 21 12:32:01 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add BuildRequires for pkgconfig(sndfile) and pkgconfig(vulkan)
  so the vulkan plugin is built.
- Version the spa-plugins subpackage so different versions of
  the plugins can be co-installed in the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 18:54:53 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.0:
  + The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the developement of
    PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
    mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
    layer with comparable performance to JACK2.
  + The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
    developement files and runtime paths are versioned so that
    future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
    exising applications.
  + PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
    that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
    session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
    expected that future version will either switch to a more
    flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
    configuration options of the example session manager.
  + PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
    compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
    of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
    point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
    libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
    compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
    switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
    or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
    anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
    compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.
    PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
    produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
    working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
    to be somewhat problematic for now.
- Add pkgconfig(bluez) and pkgconfig(libpulse) BuildRequires: New
  dependencies.
- Bump libpipewire, apiver and spa_ver define following upstreams
  changes. Also add a new sover define.
- Package new subpackages: libjack-pw0_3_0,
  libpulse-mainloop-glib-pw0_3_0, libpulse-pw0_3_0 and
  libpulse-simple-pw0_3_0, as well as handle them in post(un).
- Adjust options passed to meson following upstreams changes.

  + Improve error checking and reporting in the protocol
  + deviceprovider: fix probing without starting
  + add sentinel to some functions
  + compiler fixes for musl
  + Revert object tree permission checks that broke things, this is
    probably not a good idea (and the tree of objects is going to
    be removed later)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 16:33:08 UTC 2019 - Markus S <kamikazow@opensuse.org>
