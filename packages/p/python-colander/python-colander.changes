- Update to 1.7.0 (2019-02-01), also fixes bsc#1123996 (CVE-2017-18361)
  + The URL validator regex has been updated to no longer be
    vulnerable to a catastrophic backtracking that would have led to
    an infinite loop.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/323
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/290. 
    With thanks to Przemek (https://github.com/p-m-k).
  + This does change the behaviour of the URL validator and it no 
    longer supports file:// URI scheme 
    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8089). Users that wish to validate
    file:// URI’s should change their validator to use
    colander.file_uri instead.
  + It has also dropped support for alternate schemes outside of
    http/ftp (and their secure equivelants). Please let us know if we
    need to relax this requirement.
  + CVE-ID: CVE-2017-18361
  + The Email validator has been updated to use the same regular
    expression that is used by the WhatWG HTML specification, thereby
    increasing the email addresses that will validate correctly from
    web forms submitted.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/324
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/283
  + Number once again will allow you to serialize None to colander.null,
    this reverts an accidental revert.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/204#issuecomment-459556100
  + Integer SchemaType now supports an optional strict mode that will
    validate that the number is an integer, rather than silently accepting
    floats and truncating.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/322
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/292

- Update to 1.6.0 (2019-01-31)
  + Support custom format strings on DateTime and Date fields.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/318
  + Support sub-second precision on Time fields if provided.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/319
  + Format Python code of colander to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.
    Add some linters (flake8, black and other) into tox.ini.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/320

- Update to 1.5.1 (2018-09-10)
  + Support deserializing colander.drop and colander.required.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/304

- Update to 1.5.0 (2018-09-07)
  + Drop Python 3.3 support. Add PyPy3 and Python 3.7 as allowed failures.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/309
  + Fix email validation to not allow all ASCII characters between + and /.
    This prevents email addresses like ‘foo1,foo2@bar.baz’ from being
    validated, which would be handled as multiple email addresses by
    subsequent tools.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/315
  + Add support for enum.Enum objects.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/305
  + Recompiled language translations and updated de and el locales.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/284
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/314
