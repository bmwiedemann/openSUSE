- update to 2.0:
  * Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6.
  * Add support for Python 3.10, 3.11.
  * [breaking] If a bytes object is serialized by a String schema
    node with the encoding parameter specified, it will be passed
    through directly to str first, causing it to come out with a
    b'' prefix. In order to serialize it properly, it should be
    decoded to a string first. Previously, when the encoding
    parameter was specified it would be decoded and re-encoded,
    effectively passing it through untouched, despite not being a
    string type.
  * Add a new colander.DataURL validator.
  * Add IDN support to colander.url.
  * colander.All now supports colander.Invalid.msg being None or
    a list, otherwise colander.Invalid.asdict crashes with
    TypeError: sequence item 1: expected str instance, NoneType
    found.
  * Fixed an issue with colander.Mapping and colander.Sequence
    where a default value of drop caused missing values to be
    dropped during deserialization. (Only missing values should
    affect deserialization, and only default values should affect
    serialization.) Added many new test cases for MappingSchema
    and SequenceSchema.
  * Remove the dependency on setuptools for resolving
    pkg_resources-style importable paths in
    colander.GlobalObject.
  * Refresh localization files with Babel 2.11.
  * Add support for Python 3.9.
  * Fix handling of insert_before on deferred nodes so that it
    inserts the new node before the specified node instead of
    always appending to the end of node.children after binding.
  * Fix the broken wheels in 1.8.1 and 1.8.0 to include the
    locale data. sigh
  * Fix the broken wheels in 1.8.0 to include the locale data.
  * Drop support for Python 3.4.
  * Add support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.
  * Fix deserializer on Date and DateTime fields to correctly
    catch ValueError and TypeError exception, which can arise
    when using custom formats on the field. Instead of allowing
    these exceptions to propagate, replace then with an Invalid
    exception instead.
- drop fix-tests.patch (obsolete)

- Obsolete the lang subpackage to avoid conflicts
- Do not generate docu twice, it is provided online by
  upstream so we don't have to bother really at all

- Update to 1.7.0 (2019-02-01), also fixes bsc#1123996 (CVE-2017-18361)
  + The URL validator regex has been updated to no longer be
    vulnerable to a catastrophic backtracking that would have led to
    an infinite loop.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/323
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/290.
    With thanks to Przemek (https://github.com/p-m-k).
  + This does change the behaviour of the URL validator and it no
    longer supports file:// URI scheme
    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8089). Users that wish to validate
    file:// URI’s should change their validator to use
    colander.file_uri instead.
  + It has also dropped support for alternate schemes outside of
    http/ftp (and their secure equivelants). Please let us know if we
    need to relax this requirement.
  + CVE-ID: CVE-2017-18361
  + The Email validator has been updated to use the same regular
    expression that is used by the WhatWG HTML specification, thereby
    increasing the email addresses that will validate correctly from
    web forms submitted.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/324
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/283
  + Number once again will allow you to serialize None to colander.null,
    this reverts an accidental revert.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/204#issuecomment-459556100
  + Integer SchemaType now supports an optional strict mode that will
    validate that the number is an integer, rather than silently accepting
    floats and truncating.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/322
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/issues/292

- Update to 1.6.0 (2019-01-31)
  + Support custom format strings on DateTime and Date fields.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/318
  + Support sub-second precision on Time fields if provided.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/319
  + Format Python code of colander to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.
    Add some linters (flake8, black and other) into tox.ini.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/320

- Update to 1.5.1 (2018-09-10)
  + Support deserializing colander.drop and colander.required.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/304

- Update to 1.5.0 (2018-09-07)
  + Drop Python 3.3 support. Add PyPy3 and Python 3.7 as allowed failures.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/309
  + Fix email validation to not allow all ASCII characters between + and /.
    This prevents email addresses like ‘foo1,foo2@bar.baz’ from being
    validated, which would be handled as multiple email addresses by
    subsequent tools.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/315
  + Add support for enum.Enum objects.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/305
  + Recompiled language translations and updated de and el locales.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/284
    and https://github.com/Pylons/colander/pull/314
