      [Bug fixes]
  
      - Path::Tiny 0.101 on Windows made `$path->absolute("/foo")` return an
        absolute path starting with 'C:/foo', which was an unintentional
        behavior change.  This release now uses any absolute base without
        further normalization.
  
  0.101     2017-02-05 09:56:46-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
      [Changes]
  
      - The 'absolute' method now always returns an absolute path, even if a
        user provided a relative path for the base path.  The old, odd
        behavior was documented, but people often don't read docs.  The new
        behavior avoids suprises.
  
      [Additions]
  
      - Added 'cached_temp' method.

      - (This warning repeated from 0.079-TRIAL) The relative() method no
        longer uses File::Spec's buggy rel2bs method.  The new Path::Tiny
        algorithm should be comparable and passes File::Spec rel2abs test
        cases, except that it correctly accounts for symlinks.  For common
        use, you are not likely to notice any difference. For uncommon use,
        this should be an improvement.  As a side benefit, this change drops
        the minimum File::Spec version required, allowing Path::Tiny to be
        fatpacked if desired.

      [CHANGED]
  
      - The 'chomp' option for 'lines' will remove any end-of-line sequences
        fully instead of just chomping the last character
  
      - The 'flock' package will no longer indexed by PAUSE
  
      [FIXED]
  
      - Hides warnings and fixes possible fatal errors from pure-perl Cwd,
        particularly on MSWin32

Mon Dec  9 13:31:53 UTC 2013 - opensuse@dstoecker.de

- update to 0.047
    - Revised locking tests for portability again: locks are now tested
      from a separate process
    - Fixed child path construction against the root path.
    - Fixed t/00-report-prereqs.t for use with older versions of
      CPAN::Meta::Requirements
    - When 'realpath' can't be resolved (because intermediate directories
      don't exist), the exception now explains the error clearly instead of
      complaining about path() needing a defined, positive-length argument.
    - Removes duplicate test dependency on File::Spec that triggers
      a CPAN.pm bug
    - When using 'filehandle' to request a locked handle that truncates an
      existing file and has a binmode starting with ":unix", this fixes a
      bug where pseudo-layers weren't being cleared properly.
    - The 'filehandle' method now offers an option to return locked handles
      based on the file mode.  Input-output methods now rely on this
      feature internally.  Truncating file modes defer truncation until
      after an exclusive lock is acquired.
    - The 'filehandle' method now respects default encoding set by
      the caller's open pragma.

- updated to 0.038
   [ADDITIONS]
   - Added 'is_rootdir' method to simplify testing if a path is
     the root directory

   [FIXES]
   - Fixed for v5.8

   [PREREQS]
   - No longer lists 'threads' as a prerequisite.  If you have a threaded
     perl, you have it and if you're not, Path::Tiny doesn't care.

- update to 0.035
    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
    - Exceptions are now Path::Tiny::Error objects, not autodie exceptions;
      this removes the last dependency on autodie, which allows us to
      support Perls as far back as v5.8.1

    - Fixed flock warning on BSD that was broken with the autodie
      removal; now also applies to all BSD flavors
    - BSD/NFS flock fix was not backwards compatible before v5.14.  This
      fixes it harder.
    - dropped autodie
    - lowered ExtUtils::MakeMaker configure_requires version to 6.17
    - Perl on BSD may not support locking on an NFS filesystem.  If this is
      detected, Path::Tiny warns and continues in an unsafe mode.  The
      'flock' warning category may be fatalized to die instead.
    - Added 'iterator' example showing defaults
    - Removed several test dependencies.  Path::Tiny now only needs
      core modules, though some must be upgraded on old Perls
    - parent() on paths with internal double dots (e.g. /foo..bar.txt) now works
      correctly
    - t/zzz-spec.t used getcwd() instead of getdcwd(), which breaks
      on Windows if the build directory isn't on the 'C' drive
    - On Win32, "C:/" no longer is changed to "C:".  Also, "C:" is
      converted to the absolute path of cwd on the "C:" volume.  UNC paths
      ("//server/share/") now retain their trailing slash to correctly
      distinguish volume and directory paths when split
    - The 'children()' method now takes an optional regular expression to
      filter the results
