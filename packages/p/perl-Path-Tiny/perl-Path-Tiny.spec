%description
This module provides a small, fast utility for working with file paths. It
is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy access to functions
from several other core file handling modules. It aims to be smaller and
faster than many alternatives on CPAN, while helping people do many common
things in consistent and less error-prone ways.

Path::Tiny does not try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32
platforms. Even then, it might break if you try something particularly
obscure or tortuous. (Quick! What does this mean:
'///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././'? And how does it differ on Win32?)

All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes. Stringifying the
object gives you back the path (after some clean up).

File input/output methods 'flock' handles before reading or writing, as
appropriate (if supported by the platform and/or filesystem).

The '*_utf8' methods ('slurp_utf8', 'lines_utf8', etc.) operate in raw
mode. On Windows, that means they will not have CRLF translation from the
':crlf' IO layer. Installing Unicode::UTF8 0.58 or later will speed up
'*_utf8' situations in many cases and is highly recommended. Alternatively,
installing PerlIO::utf8_strict 0.003 or later will be used in place of the
default ':encoding(UTF-8)'.

This module depends heavily on PerlIO layers for correct operation and thus
requires Perl 5.008001 or later.
