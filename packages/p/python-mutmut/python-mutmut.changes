- version update to 2.0.0
  * New execution model. This should result in some modest speed improvements when using pytest.
  * A special execution mode when using the hammett test runner. This is MUCH MUCH faster. Please try it!
  * Dropped support for python < 3.7. If you need to use mutmut on older versions of python, please use mutmut 1.9.0
  * Some other speed improvements.
  * `mutmut run 7` will always rerun the mutant `7`
  * `mutmut show <filename>` to show all mutants for that file
  * `mutmut run <filename>` to run mutation testing on that file
  * New experimental plugin system: create a file `mutmut_config.py` in your base directory. In it you can have an `init()` function, and a `pre_mutation(context)` function. You can set `context.skip = True` to skip a mutant, and you can modify `context.config.runner`, this is useful to limit the tests. Check out the `Context` class for what information you get.
  * Better display of `mutmut show`/`mutmut result`
  * Fixed a spurious mutant on assigning a local variable with type annotations
  * mutmut now will rerun tests without mutation when tests have changed. This avoids a common pitfall of introducing a failing test and then having all mutants killed incorrectly
  * Added `mutmut html` report generation.
  * Bugfix for multiple assignment. Mutmut used to not handle `foo = bar = baz` correctly (Thanks Roxane Bellot!)
  * Bugfix for incorrect mutation of "in" operator (Thanks Roxane Bellot!)
  * Fixed bug where a mutant survived in the internal AST too long. This could cause mutmut to apply more than one mutant at a time.
  * Vastly improved startup performance when resuming a mutation run.
  * Added new experimental feature for advanced config at runtime of mutations
