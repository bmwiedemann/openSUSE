- Remove unneeded {Build,}Requires on hammett.
- We only need rich for the testsuite.
- We need toml for Python 3.10 only.

- update to 3.2.2:
  * Fixed crash when running mutmut results
  * Read paths_to_mutate from config file
  * Mutate break to return to avoid timeouts
  * Added debug mode. Enable with debug=True in setup.cfg under
    [mutmut]
  * Fixed new test detection. The old code incorrectly detected
    new tests when there were none, creating a much slower
    interaction loop for fixing mutants.
  * And many more fixes
  * Timeouts for mutants implemented.
  * Browser: syntax highlighting for diff view
  * More fixes for generators.
  * Fix for src-style layout of projects.
  * Fixed bug where mutmut would recollect all tests on every
    run, slowing down startup.
  * Correctly handle mutation for generator functions (yield).
  * Fixed so that from __future__ lines are always first.
  * If no stats are collected exit directly, as that is a
    breaking error for mutation testing.
  * Changed name mangling to make mutants less likely to trigger
    name-based python magic, like in pytest where functions named
    test_* have special meaning.
  * Another attempt to get the pypi package to work
  * Another attempt to get the pypi package to work
  * Fixed missing requirement in install package
  * Fixed missing file from the install package
  * Fixed bad entrypoint definition
  * Ignore files that can't be parsed by parso
  * Missed a file in distribution, so browse command was broken.
  * Execution model switched to mutation schemata, which enabled
    parallell execution.
  * New terminal UI
  * Pytest only, which enabled better integration, cutting
    execution time significantly.
- drop pr_134.patch (upstream)

- skip building for 3.12

- python-mock is not required for build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  2 13:29:40 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- skip python 3.6 (hammett requires python 3.7 or later)

- version update to 2.0.0
  * New execution model. This should result in some modest speed improvements when using pytest.
  * A special execution mode when using the hammett test runner. This is MUCH MUCH faster. Please try it!
  * Dropped support for python < 3.7. If you need to use mutmut on older versions of python, please use mutmut 1.9.0
  * Some other speed improvements.
  * `mutmut run 7` will always rerun the mutant `7`
  * `mutmut show <filename>` to show all mutants for that file
  * `mutmut run <filename>` to run mutation testing on that file
  * New experimental plugin system: create a file `mutmut_config.py` in your base directory. In it you can have an `init()` function, and a `pre_mutation(context)` function. You can set `context.skip = True` to skip a mutant, and you can modify `context.config.runner`, this is useful to limit the tests. Check out the `Context` class for what information you get.
  * Better display of `mutmut show`/`mutmut result`
  * Fixed a spurious mutant on assigning a local variable with type annotations
  * mutmut now will rerun tests without mutation when tests have changed. This avoids a common pitfall of introducing a failing test and then having all mutants killed incorrectly
  * Added `mutmut html` report generation.
  * Bugfix for multiple assignment. Mutmut used to not handle `foo = bar = baz` correctly (Thanks Roxane Bellot!)
  * Bugfix for incorrect mutation of "in" operator (Thanks Roxane Bellot!)
  * Fixed bug where a mutant survived in the internal AST too long. This could cause mutmut to apply more than one mutant at a time.
  * Vastly improved startup performance when resuming a mutation run.
  * Added new experimental feature for advanced config at runtime of mutations
