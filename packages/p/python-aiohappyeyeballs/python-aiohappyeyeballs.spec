%description
This library exists to allow connecting with Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) when
you already have a list of addrinfo and not a DNS name.

The stdlib version of `loop.create_connection()`
will only work when you pass in an unresolved name which
is not a good fit when using DNS caching or resolving
names via another method such was `zeroconf`.
