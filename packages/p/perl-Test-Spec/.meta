  <title>Write tests in a declarative specification style</title>
  <description>This is a declarative specification-style testing system for
behavior-driven development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a. examples) are
named with strings instead of subroutine names, so your fingers will
suffer less fatigue from underscore-itis, with the side benefit that the
test reports are more legible.
