%description
Backrefs is a wrapper around Python's built-in [Re][re] and the 3rd party [Regex][regex] library.  Backrefs adds various
additional back references (and a couple other features) that are known to some regular expression engines, but not to
Python's Re and/or Regex.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the regular expression engine being
used as the engine may already have support for some.

```python
from backrefs import bre
>>> pattern = bre.compile(r'(\p{Letter}+)')
>>> pattern.sub(r'\C\1\E', 'sometext')
'SOMETEXT'
```

# Fix build, remove build_data["tag"] to do not override the wheel
# filename, python-rpm-macros rely on the standard naming for multiflavor
