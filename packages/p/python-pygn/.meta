  <title>The Python Gateway Script: news2mail mail2news gateway</title>
  <description>Python Gateway Script from news to mail and vice versa.

It is intended to be a full SMTP/NNTP rfc compliant gateway with whitelist manager.

You will probably have to install a mail-transport-agent and/or news-transport-system package to manage SMTP/NNTP traffic.

MTA is needed for mail2news service, since mail have to be processed on a box where pyg is installed. You can use a remote smtpserver for news2mail.

News system is useful but not needed, since you can send articles to a remote SMTP server (ie: moderated NG) where is installed pyg, otherwise you will need it.

It refers to rfc 822 (mail) and 850 (news).</description>
