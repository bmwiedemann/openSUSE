-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 16:55:37 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.55.0
  * This release includes a significant number important dependency
    upgrades along with a number of new features and bug fixes.
  * NOTE: Due to NumPy CVE-2021-33430 this release has bypassed the
    usual release process so as to promptly provide a Numba release
    that supports NumPy 1.21. A single release candidate (RC1) was
    made and a few issues were reported, these are summarised as
    follows and will be fixed in a subsequent 0.55.1 release.
  * Known issues with this release:
    - Incorrect result copying array-typed field of structured
      array (#7693)
    - Two issues in DebugInfo generation (#7726, #7730)
    - Compilation failure for hash of floating point values on 32
      bit Windows when using Python 3.10 (#7713).
  * Support for Python 3.10
  * Support for NumPy 1.21
  * The minimum supported NumPy version is raised to 1.18 for
    runtime (compilation however remains compatible with NumPy
    1.11).
  * Experimental support for isinstance.
  * The following functions are now supported:
    - np.broadcast_to
    - np.float_power
    - np.cbrt
    - np.logspace
    - np.take_along_axis
    - np.average
    - np.argmin gains support for the axis kwarg.
    - np.ndarray.astype gains support for types expressed as
      literal strings.
  * For users of the Numba extension API, Numba now has a new error
    handling mode whereby it will treat all exceptions that do not
    inherit from numba.errors.NumbaException as a “hard error” and
    immediately unwind the stack. This makes it much easier to
    debug when writing @overloads etc from the extension API as
    there’s now no confusion between Python errors and Numba
    errors. This feature can be enabled by setting the environment
    variable: NUMBA_CAPTURED_ERRORS='new_style'.
  * The threading layer selection priority can now be changed via
    the environment variable NUMBA_THREADING_LAYER_PRIORITY.
  * Support for NVIDIA’s CUDA Python bindings.
  * Support for 16-bit floating point numbers and their basic
    operations via intrinsics.
  * Streams are provided in the Stream.async_done result, making it
    easier to implement asynchronous work queues.
  * Support for structured types in device arrays, character
    sequences in NumPy arrays, and some array operations on nested
    arrays.
  * Much underlying refactoring to align the CUDA target more
    closely with the CPU target, which lays the groudwork for
    supporting the high level extension API in CUDA in future
    releases.
  * Intel also kindly sponsored research and development into
    native debug (DWARF) support and handling per-function
    compilation flags:
  * Line number/location tracking is much improved.
  * Numba’s internal representation of containers (e.g. tuples,
    arrays) are now encoded as structures.
  * Numba’s per-function compilation flags are encoded into the ABI
    field of the mangled name of the function such that it’s
    possible to compile and differentiate between versions of the
    same function with different flags set.
  * There are no new general deprecations.
  * There are no new CUDA target deprecations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 18:42:21 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.54.1
  * This is a bugfix release for 0.54.0. It fixes a regression in
    structured array type handling, a potential leak on
    initialization failure in the CUDA target, a regression caused
    by Numba’s vendored cloudpickle module resetting dynamic
    classes and a few minor testing/infrastructure related
    problems.
- Release summary for 0.54.0
  * This release includes a significant number of new features,
    important refactoring, critical bug fixes and a number of
    dependency upgrades.
  * Python language support enhancements:
    - Basic support for f-strings.
    - dict comprehensions are now supported.
    - The sum built-in function is implemented.
  * NumPy features/enhancements, The following functions are now
    supported:
    - np.clip
    - np.iscomplex
    - np.iscomplexobj
    - np.isneginf
    - np.isposinf
    - np.isreal
    - np.isrealobj
    - np.isscalar
    - np.random.dirichlet
    - np.rot90
    - np.swapaxes
  * Also np.argmax has gained support for the axis keyword argument
    and it’s now possible to use 0d NumPy arrays as scalars in
    __setitem__ calls.

  Internal changes:
  * Debugging support through DWARF has been fixed and enhanced.
  * Numba now optimises the way in which locals are emitted to help
    reduce time spend in LLVM’s SROA passes.

  CUDA target changes:
  * Support for emitting lineinfo to be consumed by profiling tools
    such as Nsight Compute
  * Improved fastmath code generation for various trig, division,
    and other functions
  * Faster compilation using lazy addition of libdevice to compiled
    units
  * Support for IPC on Windows
  * Support for passing tuples to CUDA ufuncs
  * Performance warnings:
    - When making implicit copies by calling a kernel on arrays in
      host memory
    - When occupancy is poor due to kernel or ufunc/gufunc
      configuration
  * Support for implementing warp-aggregated intrinsics:
    - Using support for more CUDA functions: activemask(),
      lanemask_lt()
    - The ffs() function now works correctly!
  * Support for @overload in the CUDA target

  Intel kindly sponsored research and development that lead to a
  number of new features and internal support changes:
  * Dispatchers can now be retargetted to a new target via a user
    defined context manager.
  * Support for custom NumPy array subclasses has been added
    (including an overloadable memory allocator).
  * An inheritance based model for targets that permits targets to
    share @overload implementations.
  * Per function compiler flags with inheritance behaviours.
  * The extension API now has support for overloading class methods
    via the @overload_classmethod decorator.

  Deprecations:
  * The ROCm target (for AMD ROC GPUs) has been moved to an
    “unmaintained” status and a seperate repository stub has been
    created for it at: https://github.com/numba/numba-rocm

  CUDA target deprecations and breaking changes:
  * Relaxed strides checking is now the default when computing the
    contiguity of device arrays.
  * The inspect_ptx() method is deprecated. For use cases that
    obtain PTX for further compilation outside of Numba, use
    compile_ptx() instead.
  * Eager compilation of device functions (the case when
    device=True and a signature is provided) is deprecated.

  Version support/dependency changes:
  * LLVM 11 is now supported on all platforms via llvmlite.
  * The minimum supported Python version is raised to 3.7.
  * NumPy version 1.20 is supported.
  * The minimum supported NumPy version is raised to 1.17 for
    runtime (compilation however remains compatible with NumPy
    1.11).
  * Vendor cloudpickle v1.6.0 – now used for all pickle operations.
  * TBB >= 2021 is now supported and all prior versions are
    unsupported (not easily possible to maintain the ABI breaking
    changes).

- Update to 0.52.0
  https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release-notes.html
  This release focuses on performance improvements, but also adds
  some new features and contains numerous bug fixes and stability
  improvements.
  Highlights of core performance improvements include:
  * Intel kindly sponsored research and development into producing
    a new reference count pruning pass. This pass operates at the
    LLVM level and can prune a number of common reference counting
    patterns. This will improve performance for two primary
    reasons:
    - There will be less pressure on the atomic locks used to do
      the reference counting.
    - Removal of reference counting operations permits more
      inlining and the optimisation passes can in general do more
      with what is present.
    (Siu Kwan Lam).
  * Intel also sponsored work to improve the performance of the
    numba.typed.List container, particularly in the case of
    __getitem__ and iteration (Stuart Archibald).
  * Superword-level parallelism vectorization is now switched on
    and the optimisation pipeline has been lightly analysed and
    tuned so as to be able to vectorize more and more often
    (Stuart Archibald).
  Highlights of core feature changes include:
  * The inspect_cfg method on the JIT dispatcher object has been
    significantly enhanced and now includes highlighted output and
    interleaved line markers and Python source (Stuart Archibald).
  * The BSD operating system is now unofficially supported (Stuart
    Archibald).
  * Numerous features/functionality improvements to NumPy support,
    including support for:
    - np.asfarray (Guilherme Leobas)
    - “subtyping” in record arrays (Lucio Fernandez-Arjona)
    - np.split and np.array_split (Isaac Virshup)
    - operator.contains with ndarray (@mugoh).
    - np.asarray_chkfinite (Rishabh Varshney).
    - NumPy 1.19 (Stuart Archibald).
    - the ndarray allocators, empty, ones and zeros, accepting a
      dtype specified as a string literal (Stuart Archibald).
  * Booleans are now supported as literal types (Alexey Kozlov).
  * On the CUDA target:
  * CUDA 9.0 is now the minimum supported version (Graham Markall).
  * Support for Unified Memory has been added (Max Katz).
  * Kernel launch overhead is reduced (Graham Markall).
  * Cudasim support for mapped array, memcopies and memset has
    been   * added (Mike Williams).
  * Access has been wired in to all libdevice functions (Graham
    Markall).
  * Additional CUDA atomic operations have been added (Michae
    Collison).
  * Additional math library functions (frexp, ldexp, isfinite)
    (Zhihao   * Yuan).
  * Support for power on complex numbers (Graham Markall).
  Deprecations to note:
  * There are no new deprecations. However, note that
    “compatibility” mode, which was added some 40 releases ago to
    help transition from 0.11 to 0.12+, has been removed! Also,
    the shim to permit the import of jitclass from Numba’s top
    level namespace has now been removed as per the deprecation
    schedule.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 16:34:48 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to 0.51.2
  * The compilation chain is now based on LLVM 10 (Valentin Haenel).
  * Numba has internally switched to prefer non-literal types over literal ones so
    as to reduce function over-specialisation, this with view of speeding up
    compile times (Siu Kwan Lam).
  * On the CUDA target: Support for CUDA Toolkit 11, Ampere, and Compute
    Capability 8.0; Printing of ``SASS`` code for kernels; Callbacks to Python
    functions can be inserted into CUDA streams, and streams are async awaitable;
    Atomic ``nanmin`` and ``nanmax`` functions are added; Fixes for various
    miscompilations and segfaults. (mostly Graham Markall; call backs on
    streams by Peter Würtz).
  * Support for heterogeneous immutable lists and heterogeneous immutable string
    key dictionaries. Also optional initial/construction value capturing for all
    lists and dictionaries containing literal values (Stuart Archibald).
  * A new pass-by-reference mutable structure extension type ``StructRef`` (Siu
    Kwan Lam).
  * Object mode blocks are now cacheable, with the side effect of numerous bug
    fixes and performance improvements in caching. This also permits caching of
    functions defined in closures (Siu Kwan Lam).
  * The error handling and reporting system has been improved to reduce the size
    of error messages, and also improve quality and specificity.
  * The CUDA target has more stream constructors available and a new function for
    compiling to PTX without linking and loading the code to a device. Further,
    the macro-based system for describing CUDA threads and blocks has been
    replaced with standard typing and lowering implementations, for improved
    debugging and extensibility.

- Update to 0.49.0
  * Removal of all Python 2 related code and also updating the minimum supported
    Python version to 3.6, the minimum supported NumPy version to 1.15 and the
    minimum supported SciPy version to 1.0. (Stuart Archibald).
  * Refactoring of the Numba code base. The code is now organised into submodules
    by functionality. This cleans up Numba's top level namespace.
    (Stuart Archibald).
  * Introduction of an ``ir.Del`` free static single assignment form for Numba's
    intermediate representation (Siu Kwan Lam and Stuart Archibald).
  * An OpenMP-like thread masking API has been added for use with code using the
    parallel CPU backends (Aaron Meurer and Stuart Archibald).
  * For the CUDA target, all kernel launches now require a configuration, this
    preventing accidental launches of kernels with the old default of a single
    thread in a single block. The hard-coded autotuner is also now removed, such
    tuning is deferred to CUDA API calls that provide the same functionality
    (Graham Markall).
  * The CUDA target also gained an External Memory Management plugin interface to
    allow Numba to use another CUDA-aware library for all memory allocations and
    deallocations (Graham Markall).
  * The Numba Typed List container gained support for construction from iterables
    (Valentin Haenel).
  * Experimental support was added for first-class function types
    (Pearu Peterson).

- update to version 0.42.0:
  * In this release the major features are:
    + The capability to launch and attach the GDB debugger from within
      a jitted function.

    + #3531. Dimitri Vorona enabled the inlining of jitclass methods.
    + #3516. Simon Perkins added the support for passing numpy dtypes
       (i.e.  "np.dtype("int32")") and their type constructor
       (i.e. "np.int32") into a jitted function.
    + #3509. Rob Ennis added support for "np.corrcoef".

- update to version 0.39.0:
  * Here are the highlights for the Numba 0.39.0 release.
    + This is the first version that supports Python 3.7.
    + With help from Intel, we have fixed the issues with SVML support
      (related issues #2938, #2998, #3006).
    + List has gained support for containing reference-counted types
      like NumPy arrays and `list`.  Note, list still cannot hold
      heterogeneous types.
    + We have made a significant change to the internal
      calling-convention, which should be transparent to most users,
      to allow for a future feature that will permitting jumping back
      into python-mode from a nopython-mode function.  This also fixes
      a limitation to `print` that disabled its use from nopython
      functions that were deep in the call-stack.
    + For CUDA GPU support, we added a `__cuda_array_interface__`
      following the NumPy array interface specification to allow Numba
      to consume externally defined device arrays.  We have opened a
      corresponding pull request to CuPy to test out the concept and
      be able to use a CuPy GPU array.
    + The Numba dispatcher `inspect_types()` method now supports the
      kwarg `pretty` which if set to `True` will produce ANSI/HTML
      output, showing the annotated types, when invoked from
      ipython/jupyter-notebook respectively.
    + The NumPy functions `ndarray.dot`, `np.percentile` and
      `np.nanpercentile`, and `np.unique` are now supported.
    + Numba now supports the use of a per-project configuration file
      to permanently set behaviours typically set via `NUMBA_*` family
      environment variables.
    + Support for the `ppc64le` architecture has been added.
  * Enhancements:
    + PR #2793: Simplify and remove javascript from html_annotate
      templates.

- update to version 0.38.1:
  This is a critical bug fix release addressing:
  https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3006

  The bug does not impact users using conda packages from Anaconda or Intel Python
  Distribution (but it does impact conda-forge). It does not impact users of pip
  using wheels from PyPI.

  This only impacts a small number of users where:

   * The ICC runtime (specifically libsvml) is present in the user's environment.
   * The user is using an llvmlite statically linked against a version of LLVM
     that has not been patched with SVML support.
   * The platform is 64-bit.

  The release fixes a code generation path that could lead to the production of
  incorrect results under the above situation.

  Fixes:
  * PR #3007: Augment SVML detection with llvmlite SVML patch
    detection.

- update to version 0.38.0:
  * highlights:
    + Numba (via llvmlite) is now backed by LLVM 6.0, general
      vectorization is improved as a result. A significant long
      standing LLVM bug that was causing corruption was also found and
      fixed.
    + Further considerable improvements in vectorization are made
      available as Numba now supports Intel's short vector math
      library (SVML).  Try it out with `conda install -c numba
      icc_rt`.
    + CUDA 8.0 is now the minimum supported CUDA version.
  * Other highlights include:
    + Bug fixes to `parallel=True` have enabled more vectorization
      opportunities when using the ParallelAccelerator technology.
    + Much effort has gone into improving error reporting and the
      general usability of Numba. This includes highlighted error
      messages and performance tips documentation. Try it out with
      `conda install colorama`.
    + A number of new NumPy functions are supported, `np.convolve`,
      `np.correlate` `np.reshape`, `np.transpose`, `np.permutation`,
      `np.real`, `np.imag`, and `np.searchsorted` now supports
      the`side` kwarg. Further, `np.argsort` now supports the `kind`
      kwarg with `quicksort` and `mergesort` available.
    + The Numba extension API has gained the ability operate more
      easily with functions from Cython modules through the use of
      `numba.extending.get_cython_function_address` to obtain function
      addresses for direct use in `ctypes.CFUNCTYPE`.
    + Numba now allows the passing of jitted functions (and containers
      of jitted functions) as arguments to other jitted functions.
    + The CUDA functionality has gained support for a larger selection
      of bit manipulation intrinsics, also SELP, and has had a number
      of bugs fixed.
    + Initial work to support the PPC64LE platform has been added,
      full support is however waiting on the LLVM 6.0.1 release as it
      contains critical patches not present in 6.0.0.  It is hoped
      that any remaining issues will be fixed in the next release.
    + The capacity for advanced users/compiler engineers to define
      their own compilation pipelines.
