protocol for inter-networking applications over HTTP. It uses JSON as the
data format for of all facets of a remote procedure call, including all
application data carried in parameters.

The old modules - JSONRPC::Transport::HTTP and Apache::JSONRPC are deprecated.
Please try to use JSON::RPC::Server and JSON::RPC::Client which support both
JSON-RPC protocol version 1.1 and 1.0.</description>
