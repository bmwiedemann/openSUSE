%description
A library used by various Pylons Project packages for internationalization
(i18n) duties related to translation.

This package provides a translation string class, a translation string factory
class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility that helps
Chameleon templates use translation facilities of this package. It does not
depend on Babel, but its translation and pluralization services are meant to
work best when provided with an instance of the babel.support.Translations class.
