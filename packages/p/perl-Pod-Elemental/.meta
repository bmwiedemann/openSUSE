  <title>perl-Pod-Elemental - Work with nestable Pod elements</title>
  <description>Pod::Elemental is a system for treating a Pod (plain old documentation|perlpod) documents as trees of elements. This model may be familiar from many other document systems, especially the HTML DOM. Pod::Elemental's document object model is much less
sophisticated than the HTML DOM, but still makes a lot of document transformations easy.</description>
