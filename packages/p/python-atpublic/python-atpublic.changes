- version update to 2.3
  2.3 (2021-04-13)
  ================
  * Do type hinting the right way. (GL#10)
  
  2.2 (2021-04-13)
  ================
  * ``public()`` and ``private()`` can't be correctly type annotated, so the
    type hints on these two functions have been removed.  The ``ModuleAware``
    was also removed.  (GL#10)
  * Added a ``py.typed`` file to satisfy type checkers.  (GL#9)
  * Fixed a documentation cross-reference bug.
