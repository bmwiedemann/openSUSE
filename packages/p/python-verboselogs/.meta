  <title>Verbose logging level for Python's logging module</title>
  <description>The verboselogs_ package extends Python's logging_ module to add the log levels
VERBOSE_, NOTICE_, and SPAM_:

- The VERBOSE level sits between the predefined INFO and DEBUG levels.
- The NOTICE level sits between the predefined WARNING and INFO levels.
- The SPAM level sits between the predefined DEBUG and NOTSET levels.

The code to do this is simple and short, but I still don't want to copy/paste
it to every project I'm working on, hence this package. It's currently tested
on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and PyPy.
