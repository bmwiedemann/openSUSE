  <title>Do use_ok() for all the MANIFESTed modules</title>
  <description>I'm sick of writing 00_load.t (or something like that) that'll do use_ok()
for every module I write. I'm sicker of updating 00_load.t when I add
another file to the distro. This module reads MANIFEST to find modules to
be tested and does use_ok() for each of them. Now all you have to do is
update MANIFEST. You don't have to modify the test any more (hopefully).
