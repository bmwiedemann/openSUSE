-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 15 09:54:34 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Added minimum versions to dependencies where provided by upstream
- Re-enable tests on Python 3
- Update to 4.3.0
  * Added Python 3.7 support.
  * Avoid caching queues which are declared with a TTL.
    Queues that are declared with a TTL are now also be excluded from the
    in-memory cache in case they expire between publishes on the same channel.
  * Added an index to the Message table for the SQLAlchemy transport.
    The index allows to effectively sorting the table by the message's timestamp.
  * Added a timeout that limits the amount of time we retry
    to reconnect to a transport.
  * Class celery.asynchronous.hub.Hub is now reentrant.
    This allows calling celery.bin.celery.main to revive a worker in
    the same process after rescuing from shutdown.
  * Queues now accept string exchange names as arguments as documented.
    Tests were added to avoid further regressions.
  * Specifying names for broadcast queues now work as expected.
    Previously, named broadcast queues did not create multiple queues per worker.
    They incorrectly declared the named queue which resulted in one queue per
    fanout exchange, thus missing the entire point of a fanout exchange.
    The behavior is now matched to unnamed broadcast queues.
  * When initializing the Redis transport in conjunction with gevent
    restore all unacknowledged messages to queue.
  * Allow kombu.simple.SimpleQueue to pass queue_arguments to Queue object,
    which allows it to connect to RabbitMQ queues with custom arguments
    like 'x-queue-mode'='lazy'.
  * Add support for 'rediss' scheme for secure Redis connections.
  * Added the Azure Storage Queues transport.
  * Added the Azure Service Bus transport.
  * Drop remaining mentions of Jython support completely.
  * When publishing messages to the Pidbox, retry if an error occurs.
  * Fix infinite loop in kombu.asynchronous.hub.Hub.create_loop.
    Previous attempt to fix the problem (PR kombu/760) did not consider
    an edge case. It is now fixed.
  * Worker shutdown no longer duplicates messages when using the SQS broker.
  * When using the SQS broker, prefer boto's default region before our hardcoded default.
  * Fixed closing of shared redis sockets which previously caused Celery to hang.
  * the Pyro transport now works with recent Pyro versions.
    Also added a Pyro Kombu Broker that this transport needs for its queues.
  * Handle non-base64-encoded SQS messages.
  * Move the handling of Sentinel failures to the redis library itself.
    Previously, Redis Sentinel worked only if the first node's sentinel
    service in the URI was up. A server outage would have caused downtime.
  * When using Celery and the pickle serializer with binary data as part of the
    payload, `UnicodeDecodeError` would be raised as the content was not utf-8.
    We now replace on errors.
  * Allow setting boto3.sqs.create_queue Attributes via transport_options.
  * Fixed infinite loop when entity.channel is replaced by revive() on connection
    drop.
  * Added optional support for Brotli compression.
  * When using the SQS broker, FIFO queues with names that ended with the 'f' letter
    were incorrectly parsed. This is now fixed.
  * Added optional support for LZMA compression.
  * Added optional support for ZStandard compression.
  * Require py-amqp 2.4.0 as the minimum version.
  * The value of DISABLE_TRACEBACKS environment variable is now respected on debug, info
    and warning logger level.
  * As documented in kombu/#741 and eventlet/eventlet#415 there is a mismatch
    between the monkey-patched eventlet queue and the interface Kombu is
    expecting. This causes Celery to crash when the broker_pool_limit
    configuration option is set.  eventlet/eventlet#415 suggests that the
    mutex can be a noop. This is now the case.
  * Documentation improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 31 16:19:15 CET 2019 - mcepl@suse.com

      connected.
    *  Now passing ``max_retries``, ``interval_start``,
       ``interval_step``, ``interval_max`` parameters from broker
       ``transport_options`` to
       :meth:`~kombu.Connection.ensure_connection` when returning

Fri Apr 12 17:47:22 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.5.10:
  Kombu 3 consumers will no longer accept pickle/yaml or msgpack
  by default, and you will have to explicitly enable untrusted deserializers
  either globally using kombu.enable_insecure_serializers, or
  using the accept argument to kombu.Consumer.
  - New utility function to disable/enable untrusted serializers.
    - kombu.disable_insecure_serializers
    - kombu.enable_insecure_serializers
  - Consumer: `accept` can now be used to specify a whitelist
    of content types to accept.
    If the accept whitelist is set and a message is received
    with a content type that is not in the whitelist then a
    :exc:`~kombu.exceptions.ContentDisallowed` exception
    is raised.  Note that this error can be handled by the already
    existing `on_decode_error` callback
    Examples:
        Consumer(accept=['application/json'])
        Consumer(accept=['pickle', 'json'])
  - Now depends on amqp 1.0.11
  - pidbox: Mailbox now supports the `accept` argument.
  - Redis: More friendly error for when keys are missing.
  - Connection URLs: The parser did not work well when there were
    multiple '+' tokens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 11 16:51:37 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.5.9:

    names.
  - SQS: Adds new transport option queue_prefix.
    Contributed by j0hnsmith.

Thu Mar 21 19:57:35 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.5.8:
  - Now depends on amqp 1.0.10 which fixes a Python 3 compatibility
    error.
  - Redis: Fixed a possible race condition (Issue #171).
  - Redis: Ack emulation/visibility_timeout can now be disabled
    using a transport option.
    Ack emulation adds quite a lot of overhead to ensure data is safe
    even in the event of an unclean shutdown.  If data loss do not worry
    you there is now an `ack_emulation` transport option you can use
    to disable it:
    Connection('redis://', transport_options={'ack_emulation': False})
  - SQS: Fixed boto v2.7 compatibility (Issue #207).
  - Exchange: Should not try to re-declare default exchange ("")
    (Issue #209).

    implemented correctly, resulting in long delays between receiving
    messages (Issue #202).
  - Fixed Python 2.6 incompatibility depending on exc.errno
    being available.
    Fix contributed by Ephemera.

Thu Feb  7 19:34:15 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.5.5:
  SQS: Now supports long polling (Issue #176).
    The polling interval default has been changed to 0 and a new
    transport option (wait_time_seconds) has been added.
    This parameter specifies how long to wait for a message from
    SQS, and defaults to 20 seconds, which is the maximum
    value currently allowed by Amazon SQS.
    Contributed by James Saryerwinnie.
  - SQS: Now removes unpickleable fields before restoring messages.
  - Consumer.__exit__ now ignores exceptions occurring while
    cancelling the consumer.
  - Virtual:  Routing keys can now consist of characters also used
    in regular expressions (e.g. parens) (Issue #194).
  - Virtual: Fixed compression header when restoring messages.
    Fix contributed by Alex Koshelev.
  - Virtual: ack/reject/requeue now works while using basic_get.
  - Virtual: Message.reject is now supported by virtual transports
    (requeue depends on individual transport support).
  - Fixed typo in hack used for static analyzers.
    Fix contributed by Basil Mironenko.

- Update to 2.5.3:
  - Pidbox: Fixed compatibility with Python 2.6
- Aditional changes from 2.5.2:
  - [Redis] Fixed connection leak and added a new 'max_connections'
    transport option.
- Aditional changes from 2.5.1
  - Fixed bug where return value of Queue.as_dict could not be
    serialized with JSON (Issue #177).
- Aditional changes from 2.5.0
  - py-amqp is now the new default transport, replacing amqplib.
    The new py-amqp library is a fork of amqplib started with the
    following goals:
        - Uses AMQP 0.9.1 instead of 0.8
        - Support for heartbeats (Issue #79 + Issue #131)
        - Automatically revives channels on channel errors.
        - Support for all RabbitMQ extensions
            - Consumer Cancel Notifications (Issue #131)
            - Publisher Confirms (Issue #131).
            - Exchange-to-exchange bindings: exchange_bind /
              exchange_unbind.
        - API compatible with librabbitmq so that it can be used
          as a pure-python replacement in environments where rabbitmq-c
          cannot be compiled. librabbitmq will be updated to support
          all the same features as py-amqp.
  - Support for using multiple connection URL's for failover.
    The first argument to kombu.Connection can now be a list of connection
    URLs:

        Connection(['amqp://foo', 'amqp://bar'])

    or it can be a single string argument with several URLs separated by
    semicolon:

        Connection('amqp://foo;amqp://bar')

    There is also a new keyword argument failover_strategy that defines
    how kombu.Connection.ensure_connection, kombu.Connection.ensure,
    kombu.Connection.autoretry will reconnect in the event of connection
    failures.

    The default reconnection strategy is round-robin, which will simply
    cycle through the list forever, and there's also a shuffle strategy
    that will select random hosts from the list.  Custom strategies can also
    be used, in that case the argument must be a generator yielding the URL
    to connect to.

    Example:
        Connection('amqp://foo;amqp://bar')
  - Now supports PyDev, PyCharm, pylint and other static code analysis tools.
  - kombu.Queue now supports multiple bindings.
    You can now have multiple bindings in the same queue by having
    the second argument be a list:

        from kombu import binding, Queue

        Queue('name', [
            binding(Exchange('E1'), routing_key='foo'),
            binding(Exchange('E1'), routing_key='bar'),
            binding(Exchange('E2'), routing_key='baz'),
        ])

    To enable this, helper methods have been added:

        - kombu.Queue.bind_to
        - kombu.Queue.unbind_from

    Contributed by Rumyana Neykova.
  - Custom serializers can now be registered using Setuptools entry-points.
    See serialization-entrypoints.
  - New kombu.common.QoS class used as a thread-safe way to manage
    changes to a consumer or channels prefetch_count.
    This was previously an internal class used in Celery now moved to
    the kombu.common module.
  - Consumer now supports a on_message callback that can be used to process
    raw messages (not decoded).
    Other callbacks specified using the callbacks argument, and the
    receive` method will be not be called when a on message callback is
    present.
  - New utility kombu.common.ignore_errors ignores connection and
    channel errors.
    Must only be used for cleanup actions at shutdown or on connection loss.
  - Support for exchange-to-exchange bindings.
    The kombu.Exchange entity gained bind_to
    and unbind_from methods:

        e1 = Exchange('A')(connection)
        e2 = Exchange('B')(connection)

        e2.bind_to(e1, routing_key='rkey', arguments=None)
        e2.unbind_from(e1, routing_key='rkey', arguments=None)

    This is currently only supported by the pyamqp transport.

Thu Jul 26 00:01:34 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.3.0:
  - New pyamqp:// transport!
    The new py-amqp library is a fork of amqplib started with the
    following goals:
        - Uses AMQP 0.9.1 instead of 0.8
        - Should support all RabbitMQ extensions
        - API compatible with librabbitmq so that it can be used
          as a pure-python replacement in environments where rabbitmq-c cannot
          be compiled.

    py-amqp: http://amqp.readthedocs.org/

    If you start using use py-amqp instead of amqplib you can enjoy many
    advantages including:

        - Heartbeat support (Issue #79 + Issue #131)
        - Consumer Cancel Notifications (Issue #131)
        - Publisher Confirms

    amqplib has not been updated in a long while, so maintaining our own fork
    ensures that we can quickly roll out new features and fixes without
    resorting to monkey patching.

    To use the py-amqp transport you must install the amqp library:

        $ pip install amqp

    and change the connection URL to use the correct transport:

        >>> conn = Connection('pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//')


    The pyamqp:// transport will be the default fallback transport
    in Kombu version 3.0, when librabbitmq is not installed,
    and librabbitmq will also be updated to support the same features.

  - Connection now supports heartbeat argument.
    If enabled you must make sure to manually maintain heartbeats
    by calling the Connection.heartbeat_check at twice the rate
    of the specified heartbeat interval.

    E.g. if you have Connection(heartbeat=10),
    then you must call Connection.heartbeat_check() every 5 seconds.

    if the server has not sent heartbeats at a suitable rate then
    the heartbeat check method must raise an error that is listed
    in Connection.connection_errors.

    The attribute Connection.supports_heartbeats has been added
    for the ability to inspect if a transport supports heartbeats
    or not.

    Calling heartbeat_check on a transport that does
    not support heartbeats results in a noop operation.

  - SQS: Fixed bug with invalid characters in queue names.
    Fix contributed by Zach Smith.
  - utils.reprcall: Fixed typo where kwargs argument was an empty tuple by

    and kombu.utils.url.parse_url can now be
    imported from the kombu module directly.
  - Pidbox transport callback after_reply_message_received now happens
    in a finally block.
  - Trying to use the librabbitmq:// transport will now show the right
    name in the ImportError if librabbitmq is not installed.
    The librabbitmq falls back to the older pylibrabbitmq name for
    compatibility reasons and would therefore show No module named
    pylibrabbitmq instead of librabbitmq.

- Update to 2.2.2:
  - Now depends on anyjson 0.3.3
  - Json serializer: Now passes buffer objects directly,
    since this is supported in the latest anyjson version.
  - Fixes blocking epoll call if timeout was set to 0.
    Fix contributed by John Watson.
  - setup.py now takes requirements from the requirements/ directory.
  - The distribution directory contrib/ is now renamed to extra/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 14:40:14 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.2.1:

  - SQS: Default visibility timeout is now 30 minutes.
    Since we have ack emulation the visibility timeout is
    only in effect if the consumer is abrubtly terminated.
  - retry argument to Producer.publish now works properly,
    when the declare argument is specified.
  - Json serializer: didn't handle buffer objects (Issue #135).
    Fix contributed by Jens Hoffrichter.
  - Virtual: Now supports passive argument to exchange_declare.
  - Exchange & Queue can now be bound to connections (which will use
    the default channel):
    >>> exchange = Exchange("name")
    >>> bound_exchange = exchange(connection)
    >>> bound_exchange.declare()
  - SimpleQueue & SimpleBuffer can now be bound to connections (which
    will use the default channel).
  - Connection.manager.get_bindings now works for librabbitmq and pika.
  - Adds new transport info attributes:
    - Transport.driver_type
        Type of underlying driver, e.g. "amqp", "redis", "sql".
    - Transport.driver_name
        Name of library used e.g. "amqplib", "redis", "pymongo".
    - Transport.driver_version()
        Version of underlying library.

- Update to 2.2.0:
  - Please read descriptive changelog here:
    http://kombu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#version-2-2-0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  7 20:49:30 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.8:
  * Bound Exchange/Queue's are now pickleable.
  * Consumer/Producer can now be instantiated without a channel,
    and only later bound using .revive(channel).
  * ProducerPool now takes Producer argument.
  * kombu.utils.fxrange now counts forever if the
    stop argument is set to None.
    (fxrange is like xrange but for decimals).
  * Auto delete support for virtual transports were incomplete
    and could lead to problems so it was removed.
  * Cached declarations (kombu.common.maybe_declare)
    are now bound to the underlying connection, so that
    entities are redeclared if the connection is lost.
    This also means that previously uncacheable entities
    (e.g. non-durable) can now be cached.
  * compat ConsumerSet: can now specify channel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 27 18:59:01 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.7:
  * compat consumerset now accepts optional channel argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 14:41:50 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.6:
  * SQLAlchemy transport was not working correctly after URL parser change.
  * maybe_declare now stores cached declarations per underlying connection
    instead of globally, in the rare case that data disappears from the
    broker after connection loss.
  * Django: Added South migrations.
    Contributed by Joseph Crosland.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 13 17:37:56 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

    Example::
        BrokerConnection("sqla+mysql://localhost/db")
  * Better support for anonymous queues (Issue #116).
    Contributed by Michael Barrett.
  * Connection.as_uri now quotes url parts (Issue #117).
  * Beanstalk: Can now set message TTR as a message property.
    Contributed by Andrii Kostenko

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  3 16:49:46 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.4:
  * MongoDB:  URL parsing are now delegated to the pymongo library
    (Fixes Issue #103 and Issue #87).
    Fix contributed by Flavio Percoco Premoli and James Sullivan
  * SQS:  A bug caused SimpleDB to be used even if sdb persistence
    was not enabled (Issue #108).
    Fix contributed by Anand Kumria.

  * All transport 'channel_errors' lists now includes
    kombu.exception.StdChannelError.
  * All kombu exceptions now inherit from a common
    kombu.exceptions.KombuError.

- Don't install INSTALL
- Run testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  4 18:00:49 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.0:
  * MongoDB: Now supports fanout (broadcast) (Issue #98).
    Contributed by Scott Lyons.
  * pika transport: Now works with pika 0.9.5 and 0.9.6dev.
    The old pika transport (supporting 0.5.x) is now available
    as alias oldpika.
    (Note terribly latency has been experienced with the new pika
    versions, so this is still an experimental transport).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 17 01:15:23 UTC 2012 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.0.0:
  Important Notes
  - No longer supports Python 2.4.
  New Transports
  - django-kombu is now part of Kombu core.
  - kombu-sqlalchemy is now part of Kombu core.
  News
  - kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin is a mixin class that lets you
    easily write consumer programs and threads.
  - SQS Transport: Added support for SQS queue prefixes (Issue #84).
  - Producer.publish now supports automatic retry.
  - Producer.publish now supports a declare keyword argument.
  Fixes
  - Redis transport: Timeout was multiplied by 1000 seconds when 
    using select for event I/O (Issue #86).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 14:55:08 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.5.1:
  * Fixes issue with kombu.compat introduced in 1.5.0 (Issue #83).
  * Adds the ability to disable content_types in the serializer registry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 28 02:19:24 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.5.0:
  * kombu.pools: Fixed a bug resulting in resources not being properly released.
    This was caused by the use of __hash__ to distinguish them.
  * Virtual transports: Dead-letter queue is now disabled by default.
    The dead-letter queue was enabled by default to help application
    authors, but now that Kombu is stable it should be removed.
    There are after all many cases where messages should just be dropped
    when there are no queues to buffer them, and keeping them without
    supporting automatic cleanup is rather considered a resource leak
    than a feature.

    If wanted the dead-letter queue can still be enabled, by using
    the deadletter_queue transport option:

        >>> x = BrokerConnection("redis://",
        ...       transport_options={"deadletter_queue": "ae.undeliver"})

    In addition, an UndeliverableWarning is now emitted when
    the dead-letter queue is enabled and a message ends up there.
  * MongoDB transport now supports Replicasets (Issue #81).
  * The Connection.ensure methods now accepts a max_retries value
    of 0.
    A value of 0 now means *do not retry*, which is distinct from :const:None
    which means *retry indefinitely*.
  * SQS Transport: Now has a lowercase sqs alias, so that it can be
    used with broker URLs (Issue #82).
  * SQS Transport: Fixes KeyError on message acknowledgements (Issue #73).
    The SQS transport now uses UUID's for delivery tags, rather than
    a counter.
  * SQS Transport: Unicode related fixes (Issue #82).
  * Redis version check could crash because of improper handling of types
    (Issue #63).
  * Fixed error with Resource.force_close_all, when resources
    not yet properly initialized.  (Issue #78).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 27 22:33:03 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.4.3:
  -  Fixes bug in ProducerPool where too many resources would be acquired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Empty messages would not raise an exception not able to be
    handled by on_decode_error (Issue #72)
  - CouchDB: Properly authenticate if user/password set (Issue #70)
  - BrokerConnection.Consumer had the wrong signature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 18:46:36 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

  - MongoDB transport did not work with MongoDB >= 2.0 (Issue #66)
  - Redis-py version check did not account for beta identifiers in
    version string.
  - Producer and Consumer now accepts a connection instance as the
    first argument.
  - BrokerConnection has aquired a connected attribute that can be
    used to check if the connection instance has established a
    connection.
  - ConnectionPool.acquire_channel now returns the connections
    default channel rather than establising a new channel that must be manually handled.
  - Added kombu.common.maybe_declare
  - kombu.compat.entry_to_queue() has been moved to kombu.common
  - New module kombu.clocks now contains an implementation of

- Update to 1.3.1:
  * Last release broke after fork for pool reinitialization.
  * Producer/Consumer now has a connection attribute,
    giving access to the BrokerConnection of the
    instance.
  * Pika: Channels now have access to the underlying
    BrokerConnection instance using channel.connection.client.
    This was previously required by the Simple classes and is now
    also required by Consumer and Producer.
  * Connection.default_channel is now closed at object revival.
  * Adds kombu.clocks.LamportClock.
  * compat.entry_to_queue has been moved to new module kombu.common.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  5 22:53:31 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.3.0:
  * Broker connection info can be now be specified using URLs

  * SQS Transport: Persistence using SimpleDB is now disabled by
    default, after reports of unstable SimpleDB connections leading
    to errors
  * Producer can now be used as a context manager
  * Producer.__exit__ now properly calls release instead of close
  * Now silences all exceptions from import ctypes to match behaviour

    Issue #53)
  * amqp is now an alias to the amqplib transport
  * kombu.syn.detect_environment now returns ‘default’, ‘eventlet’,

    argument include_password is set
  * Virtual transports now comes with a default
    default_connection_params attribute

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 29 12:44:33 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * Now depends on amqplib >= 1.0.0.
  * Redis: Now automatically deletes auto_delete queues at basic_cancel.
  * serialization.unregister added so it is possible to remove unwanted
    seralizers.
  * Fixes MemoryError while importing ctypes on SELinux (Issue #52).
  * BrokerConnection.autoretry is a version of ensure that works
    with arbitrary functions (i.e. it does not need an associated object
    that implements the revive method.
  * ConnectionPool.acquire no longer force establishes the connection.
     The connection will be established as needed.
  * BrokerConnection.ensure now supports an on_revive callback
    that is applied whenever the connection is re-established.
  * Consumer.consuming_from(queue) returns True if the Consumer is
    consuming from queue.
  * Consumer.cancel_by_queue did not remove the queue from queues.

Mon Jun 13 22:42:00 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.1.6:
  * Redis: Fixes issue introduced in 1.1.4, where a redis connection
    failure could leave consumer hanging forever.
  * SQS: Now supports fanout messaging by using SimpleDB to store routing
    tables.

    This can be disabled by setting the supports_fanout transport option:

        >>> BrokerConnection(transport="SQS",
        ...                  transport_options={"supports_fanout": False})
  * SQS: Now properly deletes a message when a message is acked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 21 18:07:47 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.1.3:
  * Redis: Consuming from multiple connections now works with
    Eventlet.
  * Redis: Can now perform channel operations while the channel
    is in BRPOP/LISTEN mode (Issue #35).
      Also the async BRPOP now times out after 1 second, this
      means that cancelling consuming from a queue/starting
      consuming from additional queues has a latency of up to
      one second (BRPOP does not support subsecond timeouts).
  * Virtual: Allow channel objects to be closed multiple times
    without error.
  * amqplib: AttributeError has been added to the list of known
    connection related errors (Connection.connection_errors).
  * amqplib: Now converts SSLError timeout errors to
    socket.timeout (http://bugs.python.org/issue10272)
  * Ensures cyclic references are destroyed when the connection
    is closed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  6 17:43:07 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.1.2:
  * Redis: Fixes serious issue where messages could be lost.
    The issue could happen if the message exceeded a certain number
    of kilobytes in size.
    It is recommended that all users of the Redis transport should
    upgrade to this version, even if not currently experiencing any
    issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  6 00:59:48 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.1.1:
  * Virtual transports: Message body is now base64 encoded by
    default (Issue #27).
    This should solve problems sending binary data with virtual
    transports.
    Message compatibility is handled by adding a body_encoding
    property, so messages sent by older versions is compatible
    with this release. However – If you are accessing the
    messages directly not using Kombu, then you have to respect
    the body_encoding property.
    For transport authors:
      You don’t have to change anything in your custom
      transports, as this is handled automatically by the base
      class.
      If you want to use a different encoder you can do so by
      adding a key to Channel.codecs. Default encoding is
      specified by the Channel.body_encoding attribute.
      A new codec must provide two methods: encode(data) and
      decode(data).
  * ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Setting limit=None
    (or 0) now disables pool semantics, and will establish and
    close the resource whenever acquired or released.
  * ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Is now using a LIFO
    queue instead of the previous FIFO behavior.
  * BrokerConnection: Cloned connections did not inherit
    transport_options (__copy__).
  * contrib/requirements is now located in the top directory of
    the distribution.
  * MongoDB: Now supports authentication using the userid and
    password arguments to BrokerConnection (Issue #30).
  * BrokerConnection: Default autentication credentials are now
    delegated to the individual transports.
  * Consumer.__exit__() did not have the correct signature
    (Issue #32).
  * Channel objects now have a channel_id attribute.
  * MongoDB: Version sniffing broke with development versions of
    mongod (Issue #29).
  * New environment variable KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION will now emit
    debug log messages for connection related actions.
    KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG will also enable KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 01:14:55 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.0.7:
  * Now depends on anyjson 0.3.1
    cjson is no longer a recommended json implementation, and anyjson
    will now emit a deprecation warning if used.
  * Please note that the Pika backend only works with version 0.5.2.
    The latest version (0.9.x) drastically changed API, and it is not
    compatible yet.
  * on_decode_error is now called for exceptions in message_to_python
    (Issue #24).
  * Redis: did not respect QoS settings.
  * Redis: Creating a connection now ensures the connection is established.
    This means BrokerConnection.ensure_connection works properly with
    Redis.
  * consumer_tag argument to Queue.consume can't be None
    (Issue #21).
    A None value is now automatically converted to empty string.
    An empty string will make the server generate a unique tag.
  * BrokerConnection now supports a transport_options argument.
    This can be used to pass additional arguments to transports.
  * Pika: drain_events raised socket.timeout even if no timeout
    set (Issue #8).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 16:59:52 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 1.0.6:
  - The delivery_mode aliases (persistent/transient) were not
    automatically converted to integer, and would cause a crash if
    using the amqplib transport.
  - Redis: The redis-py InvalidData exception suddenly changed
    name to DataError.
  - The KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG environment variable can now be set to log
    all channel method calls.
  - Support for the following environment variables have been added:
    - KOMBU_LOG_CHANNEL will wrap channels in an object that logs
      every method call.
    - KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG both enables channel logging and configures
      the root logger to emit messages to standard error.
- Aditional changes from 1.0.5:
  - Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels. All virtual
    transports affected (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy,
    couchdb, beanstalk).
  - Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking
    messages.
  - If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself
    as an exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation.
    (object no longer exists).
  - MongoDB transport requires the findandmodify command only
    available in MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if
    connected to an incompatible server version.
  - Virtual Transports: basic.cancel should not try to remove
    unknown consumer tag.
- Added AUTHORS Changelog FAQ INSTALL README THANKS TODO files
  as documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 00:31:41 UTC 2011 - alexandre@exatati.com.br
