  <title>AMQP Messaging Framework for Python</title>
  <description>An AMQP messaging framework for Python.

AMQP is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol
for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.

One of the most popular implementations of AMQP is RabbitMQ.

The aim of Kombu is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQP protocol, and also
provide proven and tested solutions to common messaging problems.</description>
