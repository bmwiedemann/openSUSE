Mon Dec  6 10:07:33 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- udpate to 2.8.1:
  * The simple namespace creation shortcut added in 2.8.0 was deprecated due to
    usage of CPython internal API, and will be removed soon.
  * Add C++ Exception type to throw and catch ``AttributeError``.
  * Fixed the potential for dangling references when using properties with
  ``std::optional`` types.
  * Modernize usage of ``PyCodeObject`` on Python 3.9+ (moving toward support for
    Python 3.11a1)
  * A long-standing bug in ``eigen.h`` was fixed (originally PR #3343). The bug
    was unmasked by newly added ``static_assert``'s in the Eigen 3.4.0 release.
  * Support multiple raw inclusion of CMake helper files
  * Fix harmless warning on upcoming CMake 3.22.
  * Fix 2.8.0 regression with MSVC 2017 + C++17 mode + Python 3.
  * Fix 2.8.0 regression that caused undefined behavior (typically
    segfaults) in ``make_key_iterator``/``make_value_iterator`` if dereferencing
    the iterator returned a temporary value instead of a reference.

Sat Oct 16 19:47:43 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v2.8.0
  * Added py::raise_from to enable chaining exceptions. #3215
  * Allow exception translators to be optionally registered local
    to a module instead of applying globally across all pybind11
    modules. Use
    register_local_exception_translator(ExceptionTranslator&&
    translator) instead of
    register_exception_translator(ExceptionTranslator&& translator)
    to keep your exception remapping code local to the module.
    #2650
  * Add make_simple_namespace function for instantiating Python
    SimpleNamespace objects. #2840
  * pybind11::scoped_interpreter and initialize_interpreter have
    new arguments to allow sys.argv initialization. #2341
  * Allow Python builtins to be used as callbacks in CPython. #1413
  * Added view to view arrays with a different datatype. #987
  * Implemented reshape on arrays. #984
  * Enable defining custom __new__ methods on classes by fixing bug
    preventing overriding methods if they have non-pybind11
    siblings. #3265
  * Add make_value_iterator(), and fix make_key_iterator() to
    return references instead of copies. #3293
  * Improve the classes generated by bind_map: #3310
  * Change .items from an iterator to a dictionary view.
  * Add .keys and .values (both dictionary views).
  * Allow __contains__ to take any object.
  * pybind11::custom_type_setup was added, for customizing the
    PyHeapTypeObject corresponding to a class, which may be useful
    for enabling garbage collection support, among other things.
    #3287
  * Set __file__ constant when running eval_file in an embedded
    interpreter. #3233
  * Python objects and (C++17) std::optional now accepted in
    py::slice constructor. #1101
  * The pybind11 proxy types str, bytes, bytearray, tuple, list now
    consistently support passing ssize_t values for sizes and
    indexes. Previously, only size_t was accepted in several
    interfaces. #3219
  * Avoid evaluating PYBIND11_TLS_REPLACE_VALUE arguments more than
    once. #3290
  * Bug fix: enum value's __int__ returning non-int when underlying
    type is bool or of char type. #1334
  * Fixes bug in setting error state in Capsule's pointer methods.
    #3261
  * A long-standing memory leak in py::cpp_function::initialize was
    fixed. #3229
  * Fixes thread safety for some pybind11::type_caster which
    require lifetime extension, such as for std::string_view. #3237
  * Restore compatibility with gcc 4.8.4 as distributed by
    ubuntu-trusty, linuxmint-17. #3270
  * Fix regression in CMake Python package config: improper use of
    absolute path. #3144
  * Cached Python version information could become stale when CMake
    was re-run with a different Python version. The build system
    now detects this and updates this information. #3299
  * Specified UTF8-encoding in setup.py calls of open(). #3137
  * Fix a harmless warning from CMake 3.21 with the classic Python
    discovery. #3220
  * Eigen repo and version can now be specified as cmake options.
    #3324
  * Reduced thread-local storage required for keeping alive
    temporary data for type conversion to one key per ABI version,
    rather than one key per extension module. This makes the total
    thread-local storage required by pybind11 2 keys per ABI
    version. #3275
  * Optimize NumPy array construction with additional moves. #3183
  * Conversion to std::string and std::string_view now avoids
    making an extra copy of the data on Python >= 3.3. #3257
  * Remove const modifier from certain C++ methods on Python
    collections (list, set, dict) such as (clear(), append(),
    insert(), etc...) and annotated them with py-non-const.
  * Enable readability clang-tidy-const-return and remove useless
    consts. #3254 #3194
  * The clang-tidy google-explicit-constructor option was enabled.
    #3250
  * Mark a pytype move constructor as noexcept (perf). #3236
  * Enable clang-tidy check to guard against inheritance slicing.
    #3210
  * Legacy warning suppression pragma were removed from eigen.h. On
    Unix platforms, please use -isystem for Eigen include
    directories, to suppress compiler warnings originating from
    Eigen headers. Note that CMake does this by default. No
    adjustments are needed for Windows. #3198
  * Format pybind11 with isort consistent ordering of imports #3195
  * The warnings-suppression "pragma clamp" at the top/bottom of
    pybind11 was removed, clearing the path to refactoring and IWYU
    cleanup. #3186
  * Enable most bugprone checks in clang-tidy and fix the found
    potential bugs and poor coding styles. #3166
  * Add clang-tidy-readability rules to make boolean casts explicit
    improving code readability. Also enabled other misc and
    readability clang-tidy checks. #3148
  * Move object in .pop() for list. #3116
- Release 2.7.1
  * Allow Python builtins to be used as callbacks in CPython. #1413
  * Fix regression in CMake Python package config: improper use of
    absolute path. #3144
  * Fix Mingw64 and add to the CI testing matrix. #3132
  * Specified UTF8-encoding in setup.py calls of open(). #3137
  * Add clang-tidy-readability rules to make boolean casts explicit
    improving code readability. Also enabled other misc and
    readability clang-tidy checks. #3148
  * Move object in .pop() for list. #3116
  * Removed and fixed warning suppressions. #3127 #3129 #3135 #3141
    #3142 #3150 #3152 #3160 #3161
- Release 2.7.0
  * Enable py::implicitly_convertible<py::none, ...> for
    py::class_-wrapped types. #3059
  * Allow function pointer extraction from overloaded functions.
    #2944
  * NumPy: added .char_() to type which gives the NumPy public char
    result, which also distinguishes types by bit length (unlike
    .kind()). #2864
  * Add pybind11::bytearray to manipulate bytearray similar to
    bytes. #2799
  * pybind11/stl/filesystem.h registers a type caster that, on
    C++17/Python 3.6+, converts std::filesystem::path to
    pathlib.Path and any os.PathLike to std::filesystem::path.
    #2730
  * A PYBIND11_VERSION_HEX define was added, similar to
    PY_VERSION_HEX. #3120
  * py::str changed to exclusively hold PyUnicodeObject. Previously
    py::str could also hold bytes, which is probably surprising,
    was never documented, and can mask bugs (e.g. accidental use of
    py::str instead of py::bytes). #2409
  * Add a safety guard to ensure that the Python GIL is held when
    C++ calls back into Python via object_api<>::operator() (e.g.
    py::function __call__). (This feature is available for Python
    3.6+ only.) #2919
  * Catch a missing self argument in calls to __init__(). #2914
  * Use std::string_view if available to avoid a copy when passing
    an object to a std::ostream. #3042
  * An important warning about thread safety was added to the
    iostream.h documentation; attempts to make
    py::scoped_ostream_redirect thread safe have been removed, as
    it was only partially effective. #2995
  * Performance: avoid unnecessary strlen calls. #3058
  * Fix auto-generated documentation string when using const T in
    pyarray_t. #3020
  * Unify error messages thrown by
    simple_collector/unpacking_collector. #3013
  * pybind11::builtin_exception is now explicitly exported, which
    means the types included/defined in different modules are
    identical, and exceptions raised in different modules can be
    caught correctly. The documentation was updated to explain that
    custom exceptions that are used across module boundaries need
    to be explicitly exported as well. #2999
  * Fixed exception when printing UTF-8 to a
    scoped_ostream_redirect. #2982
  * Pickle support enhancement: setstate implementation will
    attempt to setattr __dict__ only if the unpickled dict object
    is not empty, to not force use of py::dynamic_attr()
    unnecessarily. #2972
  * Allow negative timedelta values to roundtrip. #2870
  * Fix unchecked errors could potentially swallow signals/other
    exceptions. #2863
  * Add null pointer check with std::localtime. #2846
  * Fix the weakref constructor from py::object to create a new
    weakref on conversion. #2832
  * Avoid relying on exceptions in C++17 when getting a shared_ptr
    holder from a shared_from_this class. #2819
  * Allow the codec's exception to be raised instead of
    RuntimeError when casting from py::str to std::string. #2903
  * In setup_helpers.py, test for platforms that have some
    multiprocessing features but lack semaphores, which
    ParallelCompile requires. #3043
  * Fix pybind11_INCLUDE_DIR in case CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR is
    absolute. #3005
  * Fix bug not respecting WITH_SOABI or WITHOUT_SOABI to CMake.
    #2938
  * Fix the default Pybind11Extension compilation flags with a
    Mingw64 python. #2921
  * Clang on Windows: do not pass /MP (ignored flag). #2824
  * pybind11.setup_helpers.intree_extensions can be used to
    generate Pybind11Extension instances from cpp files placed in
    the Python package source tree. #2831
  * Enable clang-tidy performance, readability, and modernization
    checks throughout the codebase to enforce best coding
    practices. #3046, #3049, #3051, #3052, #3080, and #3094
  * Checks for common misspellings were added to the pre-commit
    hooks. #3076
  * Changed Werror to stricter Werror-all for Intel compiler and
    fixed minor issues. #2948
  * Fixed compilation with GCC < 5 when the user defines
    _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI. #2956
  * Added nox support for easier local testing and linting of
    contributions. #3101 and #3121
  * Avoid RTD style issue with docutils 0.17+. #3119
  * Support pipx run, such as pipx run pybind11 --include for a
    quick compile. #3117
