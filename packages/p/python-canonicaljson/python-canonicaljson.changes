Tue Sep  8 20:32:44 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.4.0: 
  - Fix producing non-standard JSON for Infinity, -Infinity, and
    NaN. This could cause errors when encoding objects into
    canonical JSON that previously used to work, but were
    incompatible with JSON implementations in other languages.
  - Use UTF-8 to fix ASCII encoding errors when data containing
    Unicode was attempted to be pretty-printed.
- Update to 1.3.0:
  - The minimum version of simplejson was bumped to 3.14.0.
  - Obsolete workaround for slow encoding of Unicode characters was
    removed.
  - New APIs were added to iteratively encode JSON.

- Update to 1.2.0:
  - JSON from the standard library is used automatically on PyPy.
  - Support for Python versions which are end-of-lifed was dropped,
    Python >= 3.5 is supported and tested in continuous
    integration.
  - An API to configure the underlying JSON library was added
    (set_json_library).
