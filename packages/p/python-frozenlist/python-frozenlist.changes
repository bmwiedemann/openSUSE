Tue Oct 21 09:56:00 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.0
  * The :file:`reusable-cibuildwheel.yml` workflow has been refactored to
    be more generic and :file:`ci-cd.yml` now holds all the configuration
    toggles
  * When building wheels, the source distribution is now passed directly
    to the ``cibuildwheel`` invocation
    Builds and tests have been added to ``ci-cd.yml`` for arm64 Windows wheels
  * Started building wheels for CPython 3.14
  * Removed ``--config-settings=pure-python=false`` from :file:`requirements/dev.txt`.
    Developers on CPython still get accelerated builds by default. To explicitly build
    a pure Python wheel, use ``pip install -e . --config-settings=pure-python=true``

Thu Sep 25 11:08:56 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.7.0
  * Added deepcopy support to FrozenList
  * Fixed an issue where ``frozenlist`` binary wheels would be
    built with debugging symbols and line tracing enabled, which
    significantly impacted performance. Line tracing is now disabled
    by default and can only be enabled explicitly
    - This change ensures that production builds are optimized for
      performance. Developers who need line tracing for debugging
      purposes can still enable it by:
      1. Setting the ``FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING`` environment variable
      2. Using the ``--config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true`` option with pip
  * Enabled ``PIP_CONSTRAINT`` environment variable in the build configuration
    to ensure the pinned Cython version from ``requirements/cython.txt`` is
    used during wheel builds.

Fri Jun  6 11:59:13 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.2
  * No significant changes
- from version 1.6.1
  * Correctly use cimport for including PyBool_FromLong
  * Exclude _frozenlist.cpp from bdists/wheels
  * Updated to use Cython 3.1 universally across the build path
- from version 1.6.0
  * Stopped implicitly allowing the use of Cython pre-release versions
    when building the distribution package
  * Implemented support for the free-threaded build of CPython 3.13
  * Started building armv7l wheels
  * Stopped implicitly allowing the use of Cython pre-release versions
    when building the distribution package
  * Started building wheels for the free-threaded build of CPython 3.13
  * The packaging metadata switched to including an SPDX license identifier
    introduced in :pep:639
  * GitHub Actions CI/CD is now configured to manage caching pip-ecosystem
    dependencies using re-actors/cache-python-deps_ -- an action by
    :user:webknjaz that takes into account ABI stability and the exact
    version of Python runtime.
  * .. _re-actors/cache-python-deps:
    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache-python-deps
  * Organized dependencies into test and lint dependencies so that no
    unnecessary ones are installed during CI runs
- Add gcc-c++ to BuildRequires
- Refresh no-pytest-cov.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 29 21:43:37 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.0:
  * An incorrect signature of the __class_getitem__ class method
    has been fixed, adding a missing class_item argument under
    Python 3.8 and older. This change also improves the code
    coverage of this method that was previously missing -- by
    :user:`webknjaz`. Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:
    :issue:`567`, :issue:`571`.
  * Rendered issue, PR, and commit links now lead to frozenlist's
    repo instead of yarl's repo. Related issues and pull requests
    on GitHub: :issue:`573`.
  * On the :doc:`Contributing docs <contributing/guidelines>`
    page, a link to the Towncrier philosophy has been fixed.
    Related issues and pull requests on GitHub: :issue:`574`.
  * A name of a temporary building directory now reflects that
    it's related to frozenlist, not yarl. Related issues and pull
    requests on GitHub: :issue:`573`.
  * Declared Python 3.13 supported officially in the distribution
    package metadata. Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:
    :issue:`595`.
- drop skip-some-attributes.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 29 14:27:41 UTC 2024 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 16 08:30:56 UTC 2024 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- Add reproducible.patch to avoid embedding a random tmp dir (boo#1062303)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 09:11:26 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.1:
  * Declared Python 3.12 and PyPy 3.8-3.10 supported officially
    in the distribution package metadata.
  * Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned
    :file:`setup.py` to an in-tree PEP 517 build backend -- by
    :user:`webknjaz`. Whenever the end-users or downstream
    packagers need to build frozenlist from source (a Git
    checkout or an sdist), they may pass a config_settings flag
    pure-python. If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be
    built and included into the distribution. Here is how this
    can be done with pip:  $ python3 -m pip install . --config-
    settings=pure-python=  This will also work with -e |
    --editable. The same can be achieved via pypa/build:  $
    python3 -m build --config-setting=pure-python=  Adding -w |
    --wheel can force pypa/build produce a wheel from source
    directly, as opposed to building an sdist and then building
    from it. Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:
    :issue:`560`.
  * Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned
    :file:`setup.py` to an in-tree PEP 517 build backend
  * Whenever the end-users or downstream packagers need to build
    frozenlist from source (a Git checkout or an sdist), they may
    pass a config_settings flag pure-python. If this flag is not
    set, a C-extension will be built and included into the
    distribution.
  * It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds
    using the with-cython-tracing PEP 517 config setting
  * This can be used in CI and development environment to measure
    coverage on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the
    end-users or downstream packagers.
    Otherwise, it's off unless requested explicitly.
  * The following produces C-files required for the Cython
    coverage plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-
    files:
  * Alternatively, the FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING=1 environment
    variable can be set to do the same as the PEP 517 config
    setting.
  * Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython
    modules
- add no-pytest-cov.patch to skip pytest-coverage
