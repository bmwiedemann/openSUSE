- update to 1.4.1:
  * Declared Python 3.12 and PyPy 3.8-3.10 supported officially
    in the distribution package metadata.
  * Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned
    :file:`setup.py` to an in-tree PEP 517 build backend -- by
    :user:`webknjaz`. Whenever the end-users or downstream
    packagers need to build frozenlist from source (a Git
    checkout or an sdist), they may pass a config_settings flag
    pure-python. If this flag is not set, a C-extension will be
    built and included into the distribution. Here is how this
    can be done with pip:  $ python3 -m pip install . --config-
    settings=pure-python=  This will also work with -e |
    --editable. The same can be achieved via pypa/build:  $
    python3 -m build --config-setting=pure-python=  Adding -w |
    --wheel can force pypa/build produce a wheel from source
    directly, as opposed to building an sdist and then building
    from it. Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:
    :issue:`560`.
  * Replaced the packaging is replaced from an old-fashioned

    set, a C-extension will be built and included into the
    distribution.
  * It is now possible to request line tracing in Cython builds
    using the with-cython-tracing PEP 517 config setting
  * This can be used in CI and development environment to measure
    coverage on Cython modules, but is not normally useful to the
    end-users or downstream packagers.
    Otherwise, it's off unless requested explicitly.
  * The following produces C-files required for the Cython
    coverage plugin to map the measurements back to the PYX-
    files:
  * Alternatively, the FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING=1 environment
    variable can be set to do the same as the PEP 517 config
    setting.
  * Coverage collection has been implemented for the Cython
    modules
- add no-pytest-cov.patch to skip pytest-coverage
