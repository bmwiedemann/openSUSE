<package name="python-attrs" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>attrs: Attributes without boilerplate.</title>
  <description>Python package with class decorators that ease the chores of implementing the most common attribute-related object protocols.

You just specify the attributes to work with and attrs gives you:

    a nice human-readable __repr__,
    a complete set of comparison methods,
    an initializer,
    and much more

without writing dull boilerplate code again and again.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing tuples or confusingly behaving namedtuples.

So put down that type-less data structures and welcome some class into your life!
