- Enhancements
  * Error messages
    o XML errors from the Expat parser are now shown along with the
      corresponding line of the erroneous XML code and the exact position of
      the error.
    o Kid is now much less picky about py:extends and py:layout expressions
      and will output much better error messages if they cause an error.
    o Kid will now also check that you dont' use a Template parameter that
      conflicts with the name of a member of the BaseTemplate class.  Output
      Format Control

    o The serialization methods now take an additional attribute format that
      must be an instance of the new Format class or a string referring to
      one of several predefined output formats. This class gives you more
      fine control over how the text content is serialized. You can do
      things like removing redundant whitespace, adding indentation, word
      wrapping, using named entities and using typographic characters for
      quotes etc. You can also plug-in your own text filters here. The
      chapter on Formatting in the User's Guide lists all available
      parameters.
    o The old filter methods of the Serializer class have been replaced by a
      more powerful general method incorporating the specified format.  HTML
      Serializer
    o As discussed on the mailing list, the HTML serializer now produces
      tags in lowercase. You can change this behavior with the transpose
      attribute or using the output method 'HTML' instead of 'html'.
    o Additional HTML output methods have been defined corresponding to
      Mozilla's "full standards mode", "almost standards mode" and "quirks
      mode." XHTML Serializer
    o The XHTML Serializer now also injects a meta tag with the content type
      at the top of the head section. This had been only done by the
      HTMLSerializer before. The content type is not injected if such a meta
      tag already exists. This automatism can be controlled with the
      inject_type parameter.  XML Comments
    o The rule when variable substitution is applied to XML comments has
      been slightly changed, as explained in the Language Specification. 
      Additional parameters for parsing templates
    o The load_template() function now takes additional parameters
      entity_map and exec_module. This lets you choose a different XML
      entity map to be used when parsing the template, and gives you more
      control over the way in which the compiled template code is executed
      in the newly created module. The entity_map parameter can also be
      passed to some other functions such as XML() and compile_file().  Full
      compatibility with Python 2.5 and Python eggs
    o The enable_import mechanism has been completely rewritten to support
      both Python 2.5 and Python eggs. The old method based on ihooks is not
      used any more since ihooks is not compatible with Python eggs; and the
      old method based on path_hooks is not used any more since in Python 2.5,
      importers installed via path_hooks do not fall back to the built-in
      import mechanism any more, breaking the previous implementation.
    o The new implementation allows enabling imports from specified paths as
      well as imports from sys.path which is now implemented via meta_path.
    o Python versions older than Python 2.3 are not supported by Kid any
      more.
  * Changes
   o Due to optimizations in kid.template_util, Kid 0.9.3 templates need to
     be re-compiled in order to run with Kid 0.9.4.
   o The 'html' output method now produces lower-case tags. If you want
     upper-case tags, you have to use the 'HTML' method now.
   o The kid.parser and kid.pull modules have been renamed kid.codewriter
     and kid.parser respectively (in anticipation of a parsing subsystem).
 * Bug Fixes
   o A couple of bugs that had been reported as trac tickets have been
     fixed.
   o Using layout templates which are extended by another template did not
     work properly (as reported on the TurboGears mailing list); this has
     been fixed.
   o More unit tests have been added. The testing machinery now supports
     both py.test and nose, or you can simply use the run_tests.py script.

Fri Aug  4 17:20:07 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.9.3
  * Re-applied a patch from ticket [66] that fix a bug where comments caused
    errors when in base templates.
  * Changed all of the lesscode.org links into kid-templating.org
  * Added and updated a few tests
  * Removed the NamespaceStack.set method and made NamespaceStack.pop return
    the deleted value.
  * Set balanced blocks to be off by default.
  * Updated the parser to better handle interpolation of non-string types in
    comments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 27 15:54:26 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.9.2
  * Enhancements
    o Updated to current version of ez_setup.py.
    o Improved importer.py, resolving tickets #103 (FutureWarnings) and 137
      #(using new import hooks).
    o The testing code can now figure out what testing modules to run
      dynamically. In addition, the code also determines which functions are
      tests dynamically. Tests that need pylib are skipped for those that
      don't have it. If you run 'python test_kid.py' now you should be
      seeing more tests executed.
    o Removed the revision history from the language and and instead include
      a pointer to the Release Notes.
  * API Changes
    o Allow the kid command to accept XML piped into it's stdin when '-' is
      used as the filename.
    o Patch from #143. The load_template() function accepts an 'ns'keyword
      argument to pre-populate the template module namespace with global
      variables. Thanks!
    o Created an API to replace the various ways that configuration options
      are currently set.
    o Allow the XML function to take a new keword parameter (xmlns) that
      sets the default namespace for a fragment.
  * Add Support for Python 2.5
     o Added support for xml.etree, which is the ElementTree packaged with
       Python 2.5. Running 'make test' only checks xml.etree currently.
     o The __future__ imports have been moved to the top of the module to
       play nicely in Python 2.5. I have also added 2.5 to the makefile so
       it will be tested before each release.
     o makefile regression test includes Python 2.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 14:48:18 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.9.1
  * Layout Templates: 
    o The parameters passed to a template with a py:layout were not visible
      in named template functions or match templates.
    o A small bug existed in Python 2.3 where the dict.update() method was
      being called incorrectly. Python 2.4 allows a list of tuples to be
      passed to update(), whereas Python 2.3 does not.
    o There is a new feature in Kid for a template to specify a layout
      template to which match templates, named template definitions, and
      template parameters will be applied. This is useful for applying a
      generic set of headers, menus, footers, etc. to a many pages without
      duplicating large amounts of code in each page.
  * py:match:
    o The logic to apply the template matches has been reworked. This was
      due to the discovery of some odd behavior when using multiple template
      inheritence.
  * Convenience Functions
    o Kid Template instances now provide convenience funcitons defined(name)
      and value_of(name).
  * Invisible Comments
    o XML comments starting with a ! character will not appear in the
      serialized output of a template.
