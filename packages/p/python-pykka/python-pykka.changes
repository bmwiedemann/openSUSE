- Update to 3.1.1:
  - Installs from the source tarball using the setup.py file
    generated by Poetry installed setup.cfg and tox.ini into
    site-packages. The workaround for this was to simply not
    include those files in the source tarball. (Fixes:
    gh#jodal/pykka#172)

- Update to 3.1.0:
  - Remove support for Python 3.6. It reached end-of-life in
    December 2021.
  - Include docs, examples, and tests in the source
    release.
  - Require mypy 0.960 and use the latest typing features, as
    these seem to work nicely even on Python 3.7, given that the
    typing information is in separate *.pyi files and that you
    have a recent mypy version.

- Follow the upstream and rename Pykka to pykka.
- Update to 3.0.2:
  - Add support for Python 3.10. Tests are now run on Python 3.10
    too. No other changes required.
  - Minor reorganization of docs.
  - Use SPDX identifier for license in project metadata.
  - Remove upper version boundary for importlib_metadata.
  - Remove support for Python 2.7. It reached end-of-life in
    January 2020.
  - Remove support for Python 3.5. It reached end-of-life in
    September 2020.
  - Remove support for running actors on top of eventlet. This
    was deprecated in Pykka 2.0.3.
  - Remove support for running actors on top of gevent. This was
    deprecated in Pykka 2.0.3
  - Remove support for automatically upgrading the internal
    message format used by Pykka < 2.0 to the message types used
    by Pykka >= 2.0.
  - Include complete type hint stubs for all public APIs in the
    PyPI distribution.
  - Remove PyPy from the test matrix. There are no known changes
    that should cause Pykka to stop working on PyPy, but we will
    no longer spend any effort to keep CI for PyPy running.
  - Mark eventlet and gevent support as deprecated. The support
    will be removed in Pykka 3.0.
  - These were somewhat interesting ways to implement concurrency
    in Python when Pykka was conceived in 2011. Today, it is
    unclear it these libraries still have any mindshare or if
    keeping the support for them just adds an unnecessary burden
    to Pykka's maintenance.
  - Include Python 3.9 in the test matrix.
  - Add missing None default value for the timeout keyword
    argument to pykka.eventlet.EventletEvent.wait(), so that it
    matches the threading.Event API.
