Tue Nov 25 12:46:05 UTC 2025 - Marius Grossu <marius.grossu@suse.com>

- Update to 4.4.0:
  * Remove pykka.__version__. Use importlib.metadata.version("pykka")
  * Port docs from Sphinx to Mkdocs and generally refresh docs
- Update to 4.3.0:
  * Remove support for Python 3.9 as it reaches end-of-life next month
  * Only allow one of Future's set(), set_exception(), and set_get_hook() methods to be called
  * Change ThreadingFuture[T] to use a threading.Condition instead of queue.Queue
  * Only call future hook once, even if it returns None
  * Use the standard library's tomllib in the docs build on Python 3.11+, removing a dependency om tomli
- Update to 4.2.0:
  * Switched build backend from poetry to hatchling.
  * Switched the docs build from using the toml library to the better maintained tomli library.
  * Development is now done using uv and tox-uv, but you should not need uv to package pykka.
  * Updated some dev tooling, including ruff and pyright.
  * Drop pydantic as a test dependency, as this made Pykka quite a lot harder to package.
  * Add Python 3.14 pre-releases to the CI test matrix.
  * Move tox' config into pyproject.toml
  * Use Trusted Publishing to when releasing to PyPI
- Update to 4.1.0:
  * Remove support for Python 3.8. It reaches end-of-life later this month
  * Support Python 3.13. No changes required
  * Fix proxy introspection breaking if an actor attribute is a Pydantic model
- Removed the line from spec files to remove the .gitignore file
- Added BuildRequires:  %{python_module hatchling} as backend for build and removed the old one

Thu Feb 22 09:56:04 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.0.2:
  * Make `get_all()` generic over the futures' type.
  * Format with `ruff format` instead of `black`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 21:40:09 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.0.1:
  * Update test suite to pass on Python 3.12 (#207)
- update to 4.0.0:
  * Require `block` and `timeout` arguments to always be keyword
    arguments. (PR: #198)
  * Remove support for Python 3.7. It reached end-of-life in June
    2023. (PR: #190)
  * Type hints: All typing stubs have been inlined in the source
    code and have been greatly improved. They are now tested
    using both Mypy and Pyright. (PR: #192, #193, #195)
  * Type hints: Due to the dynamic nature of `ActorProxy`
    objects, it is impossible to automatically type them
    correctly. `pykka.typing` is a new module with helpers for
    manually typing `ActorProxy` objects. Check out the docs for
    how to use the helpers. (PR: #199)
  * Linting: Replace flake8, isort, and friends with ruff

Sat May 28 07:34:47 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.1:
  - Installs from the source tarball using the setup.py file
    generated by Poetry installed setup.cfg and tox.ini into
    site-packages. The workaround for this was to simply not
    include those files in the source tarball. (Fixes:
    gh#jodal/pykka#172)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 20:24:54 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.0:
  - Remove support for Python 3.6. It reached end-of-life in
    December 2021.
  - Include docs, examples, and tests in the source
    release.
  - Require mypy 0.960 and use the latest typing features, as
    these seem to work nicely even on Python 3.7, given that the
    typing information is in separate *.pyi files and that you
    have a recent mypy version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 12:11:57 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Follow the upstream and rename Pykka to pykka.
- Update to 3.0.2:
  - Add support for Python 3.10. Tests are now run on Python 3.10
    too. No other changes required.
  - Minor reorganization of docs.
  - Use SPDX identifier for license in project metadata.
  - Remove upper version boundary for importlib_metadata.
  - Remove support for Python 2.7. It reached end-of-life in
    January 2020.
  - Remove support for Python 3.5. It reached end-of-life in
    September 2020.
  - Remove support for running actors on top of eventlet. This
    was deprecated in Pykka 2.0.3.
  - Remove support for running actors on top of gevent. This was
    deprecated in Pykka 2.0.3
  - Remove support for automatically upgrading the internal
    message format used by Pykka < 2.0 to the message types used
    by Pykka >= 2.0.
  - Include complete type hint stubs for all public APIs in the
    PyPI distribution.
  - Remove PyPy from the test matrix. There are no known changes
    that should cause Pykka to stop working on PyPy, but we will
    no longer spend any effort to keep CI for PyPy running.
  - Mark eventlet and gevent support as deprecated. The support
    will be removed in Pykka 3.0.
  - These were somewhat interesting ways to implement concurrency
    in Python when Pykka was conceived in 2011. Today, it is
    unclear it these libraries still have any mindshare or if
    keeping the support for them just adds an unnecessary burden
    to Pykka's maintenance.
  - Include Python 3.9 in the test matrix.
  - Add missing None default value for the timeout keyword
    argument to pykka.eventlet.EventletEvent.wait(), so that it
    matches the threading.Event API.
