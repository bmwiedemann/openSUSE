    <comment>- update to 4.0.1:
  * Update test suite to pass on Python 3.12 (#207)
- update to 4.0.0:
  * Require `block` and `timeout` arguments to always be keyword
    arguments. (PR: #198)
  * Remove support for Python 3.7. It reached end-of-life in June
    2023. (PR: #190)
  * Type hints: All typing stubs have been inlined in the source
    code and have been greatly improved. They are now tested
    using both Mypy and Pyright. (PR: #192, #193, #195)
  * Type hints: Due to the dynamic nature of `ActorProxy`
    objects, it is impossible to automatically type them
    correctly. `pykka.typing` is a new module with helpers for
    manually typing `ActorProxy` objects. Check out the docs for
    how to use the helpers. (PR: #199)
  * Linting: Replace flake8, isort, and friends with ruff</comment>
