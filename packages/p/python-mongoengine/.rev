    <comment>- update to 0.24.0:
  * EnumField improvements: now ``choices`` limits the values of an enum to allow
  * Fix bug that prevented instance queryset from using custom queryset_class #2589
  * Fix deepcopy of EmbeddedDocument #2202
  * Introduce a base exception class for MongoEngine exceptions (MongoEngineException).
    Note that this doesn't concern the pymongo errors #2515
  * Fix error when using precision=0 with DecimalField #2535
  * Add support for regex and whole word text search query #2568
  * Add support for update aggregation pipeline #2578
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Updates to support pymongo 4.0. Where possible deprecated
    functionality has been migrated, but additional care should be taken when
    migrating to pymongo 4.0 as existing code may have been using deprecated
    features which have now been removed #2614.
    For the pymongo migration guide see:
    https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migrate-to-pymongo4.html.
    In addition to the changes in the migration guide, the following is a high
    level overview of the changes made to MongoEngine when using pymongo 4.0:
    - limited support of geohaystack indexes has been removed
    - ``QuerySet.map_reduce`` has been migrated from ``Collection.map_reduce``
      and ``Collection.inline_map_reduce`` to use
      ``db.command({mapReduce: ..., ...})`` and support between the two may need
      additional verification.
    - UUIDs are encoded with the ``pythonLegacy`` encoding by default instead of
      the newer and cross platform ``standard`` encoding. Existing UUIDs will
      need to be migrated before changing the encoding, and this should be done
      explicitly by the user rather than switching to a new default by
      MongoEngine. This default will change at a later date, but to allow
      specifying and then migrating to the new format a default ``json_options``
      has been provided.
    - ``Queryset.count`` has been using ``Collection.count_documents`` and</comment>

  * Support MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism (with
    `authmechanismproperties`) #2507
  * Turning off dereferencing for the results of distinct query. #2663
  * Add tests against Mongo 5.0 in pipeline
  * Drop support for Python 3.6 (EOL)
  * Bug fix support for PyMongo&gt;=4 to fix &quot;pymongo.errors.InvalidOperation:
    Cannot use MongoClient after close&quot;
  errors. #2627

    <comment>- update to 0.27.0:
  * Update uuidRepresentation warnings with &quot;unspecified&quot; as the
    future default (instead of 'standard' previously advertised)
    #2739
  * Added `mongo_client_class` optional parameter to connect() to
    allow to use an alternative mongo client than
    pymongo.MongoClient.
  * Fix DictField that always gets marked as changed #2606
  * fix for Queryset.none() that has no effect on
    update/aggregate / first #2669
  * Changes in 0.26.0
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Improved the performance of
    :meth:`~mongoengine.Document.save()`
    by removing the call to
    :meth:`~mongoengine.Document.ensure_indexes` unless
    ``meta['auto_create_index_on_save']`` is set to True. With
    the default settings, Document indexes will still be created
    on the fly, during the first usage of the collection
    (query, insert, etc), they will just not be re-created
    whenever .save() is called.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: remove deprecated method ``ensure_index``
    (replaced by ``create_index`` long time ago).
  * Addition of Decimal128Field:
    :class:`~mongoengine.fields.Decimal128Field` for accurate
    representation of Decimals (much better than the legacy field
    DecimalField).
  * BREAKING CHANGE: When using ListField(EnumField) or
    DictField(EnumField), the values weren't always cast into the
    Enum
  * BREAKING CHANGE (bugfix) Querying ObjectIdField or</comment>
