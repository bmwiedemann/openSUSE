- Prepare support for openmpi5

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 18:22:43 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 3.9.0
  * This version of h5py requires Python 3.8 or above.
  ## New features
  * New out argument to read_direct_chunk() to allow passing the
    output buffer (PR 2232).
  * The objects from Dataset.asstr() and Dataset.astype() now
    implement the __array__() method (PR 2269). This speeds up
    access for functions that support it, such as np.asarray().
  * Validate key types when creating groups and attributes, giving
    better error messages when invalid types are used (PR 2266).
  ## Deprecations & removals
  * Using Dataset.astype() as a context manager has been removed,
    after being deprecated in h5py 3.6. Read data by slicing the
    returned object instead: dset.astype('f4')[:].
  * Exposing HDF5 functions
  * H5Pget_elink_acc_flags & H5Pset_elink_acc_flags as
    h5py.h5p.PropLAID.get_elink_acc_flags() &
    h5py.h5p.PropLAID.set_elink_acc_flags(): access the external
    link file access traversal flags in a link access property list
    (PR 2244).
  * H5Zregister as h5py.h5z.register_filter(): register an HDF5
    filter (PR 2229).
  ## Bug fixes
  * Group.__contains__ and Group.get now use the default link
    access property list systematically (PR 2244).
  * Removed various calls to the deprecated numpy.product function
    (PR 2242 & PR 2273).
  * Fix the IPython tab-completion integration in IPython 8.12 (PR
    2256).
  * Replacing attributes with AttributeManager.create() now deletes
    the old attributes before creating the new one, rather than
    using a temporary name and renaming the new attribute (PR
    2274). This should avoid some confusing bugs affecting
    attributes. However, failures creating an attribute are less
    likely to leave an existing attribute of the same name in
    place. To change an attribute value without changing its shape
    or dtype, use modify() instead.
  ## Building h5py
  * When building with Parallel HDF5 support, the version of mpi4py
    used on various Python versions is increased to 3.1.1, fixing
    building with a newer setuptools (PR 2225).
  * Some fixes towards compatibility with the upcoming Cython 3 (PR
    2247).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 16 10:05:30 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Clean up build and runtime requirements
- Drop python-h5py-relax-dependency-versions.patch -- it has become
  a noop at the last refresh.
- Only build for supported pythons (>= 3.7)
- PEP517 build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 18:59:18 UTC 2023 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * update copyright year
  * update patch

- update to version 3.8.0:
  * New features
    + h5py now has pre-built packages for Python 3.11.
    + h5py is compatible with HDF5 1.14 (:pr:`2187`). Pre-built
      packages on PyPI still include HDF5 1.12 for now.
    + :ref:`dataset_fancy` now accepts tuples, or any other sequence
      type, rather than only lists and NumPy arrays. This also
      includes range objects, but this will normally be less efficient
      than the equivalent slice.
    + New property :attr:`.Dataset.is_scale` for checking if the
      dataset is a dimension scale (:pr:`2168`).
    + :meth:`.Group.require_dataset` now validates maxshape for
      resizable datasets (:pr:`2116`).
    + :class:`.File` now has a meta_block_size argument and
      property. This influences how the space for metadata, including
      the initial header, is allocated.
    + Chunk cache can be configured per individual HDF5 dataset
      (:pr:`2127`). Use :meth:`.Group.create_dataset` for new datasets
      or :meth:`.Group.require_dataset` for already existing
      datasets. Any combination of the rdcc_nbytes, rdcc_w0, and
      rdcc_nslots arguments is allowed. The file defaults apply to
      those omitted.
    + HDF5 file names for ros3 driver can now also be s3:// resource
      locations (:pr:`2140`). h5py will translate them into AWS
      path-style URLs for use by the driver.
    + When using the ros3 driver, AWS authentication will be activated
      only if all three driver arguments are provided. Previously AWS
      authentication was active if any one of the arguments was set
      causing an error from the HDF5 library.
    + :meth:`.Dataset.fields` now implements the __array__() method
      (:pr:`2151`). This speeds up accessing fields with functions
      that expect this, like np.asarray().
    + Low-level :meth:`h5py.h5d.DatasetID.chunk_iter` method that
      invokes a user-supplied callable object on every written chunk
      of one dataset (:pr:`2202`). It provides much better performance
      when iterating over a large number of chunks.
  * Exposing HDF5 functions
    + H5Dchunk_iter as :meth:`h5py.h5d.DatasetID.chunk_iter`.
    + H5Pset_meta_block_size and H5Pget_meta_block_size (:pr:`2106`).
  * Bug fixes
    + Fixed getting the default fill value (an empty string) for
      variable-length string data (:pr:`2132`).
    + Complex float16 data could cause a TypeError when trying to
      coerce to the currently unavailable numpy.dtype('c4'). Now a
      compound type is used instead (:pr:`2157`).
    + h5py 3.7 contained a performance regression when using a boolean
      mask array to index a 1D dataset, which is now fixed
      (:pr:`2193`).
  * Building h5py
    + Parallel HDF5 can be built with Microsoft MS-MPI
      (:pr:`2147`). See :ref:`build_mpi` for details.
    + Some 'incompatible function pointer type' compile time warnings
      were fixed (:pr:`2142`).
    + Fix for finding HDF5 DLL in mingw (:pr:`2105`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 29 15:47:49 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.7.0:
  * Provide the ability to use the Direct Virtual File Driver
    (VFD) from HDF5 (Linux only).
  * The :class:`.File` constructor contains two new parameters
    alignment_threshold, and alignment_interval controling the
    data alignment within the HDF5 file (gh#h5py/h5py#2040).
  * :meth:`~.Group.create_dataset` and
    :meth:`~.Group.require_dataset` now accept parameters
    efile_prefix and virtual_prefix to set a filesystem path
    prefix to use to find files for external datasets and for
    virtual dataset sources (gh#h5py/h5py#2092). These only affect
    the current access; the prefix is not stored in the file.
  * Bugs fixed:
    - Fix a deadlock which was possible when the same dataset was
      accessed from multiple threads (gh#h5py/h5py#2064).
    - New attributes are created directly, instead of via a
      temporary attribute with subsequent renaming. This fixes
      overwriting attributes with track_order=True.
    - Fix for building with mpi4py on Python 3.10
      (gh#h5py/h5py#2101).
    - Fixed fancy indexing with a boolean array for a single
      dimension (gh#h5py/h5py#2079).
    - Avoid returning unitialised memory when reading from a
      chunked dataset with missing chunks and no fill value
      (gh#h5py/h5py#2076).
    - Enable setting of fillvalue for datasets with variable
      length string dtype (gh#h5py/h5py#2044).
    - Closing a file or calling get_obj_ids() no longer re-enables
      Python garbage collection if it was previously disabled
      (gh#h5py/h5py#2020).
- Refresh python-h5py-relax-dependency-versions.patch for updated
  version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  4 11:43:46 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.6.0:
  * Using :meth:`.Dataset.astype` as a context manager (with
    dset.astype(t):) is deprecated. Slice the object returned by
    astype instead (data = dset.astype(t)[:10]).
  * Getting the value of h5py.get_config().default_file_mode now
    issues a deprecation warning. This has been 'r' by default
    from h5py 3.0, and cannot be changed since 3.3.
- Rebase python-h5py-relax-dependency-versions.patch to apply
  against updated version.
- Also enforce %requires_eq on hdf5 to force rebuilds when hdf5
  gets version updates in Factory (boo#1196682).
- Skip tests marked with 'mpi_skip' when building with openmpi
  flavours (see e.g., https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/1997).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  9 16:08:42 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Correct order of definitions to generate multiple packages for
  multiple builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  5 16:38:52 UTC 2021 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.4.0:
  * New features
    + The pre-built wheels now bundle HDF5 1.12.1 (:pr:`1945`).
    + len() now works on dset.astype(), .asstr() and .fields()
      wrappers (:pr:`1913`).
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix bug introduced in version 3.3 that did not allow the
      creation of files using the flag "a" for certain drivers
      (e.g. mpiio, core and stdio) (:pr:`1922`).
    + Dataset indexing will now use the optimized fast path, which was
      accidentally disabled in a previous version (:pr:`1944`).
    + Fix an error building with Cython 3.0 alpha 8 (cpdef inside
      functions) (:pr:`1923`).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 23 09:37:01 UTC 2021 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 3.3.0.
  * New features
    * Compatibility with the upcoming HDF5 1.12.1 and possibly 1.14.
    * H5T_BITFIELD types will now be cast to their numpy.uint
      equivalent by default (:issue:`1258`). This means that
      no knowledge of mixed type compound dataset schemas is
      required to read these types, and can simply be read as
      follows: arr = dset[:]
      Alternatively, 8-bit bitfields can still be cast to booleans
      explicitly: arr = dset.astype(numpy.bool_)[:]
    * Key types are validated when accessing groups, to give more
      helpful errors when a group is indexed like a dataset.
    * A new :meth:`.Group.build_virtual_dataset` method acting as
      a context manager to assemble virtual datasets.
    * If the source and target of a virtual dataset mapping have
      different numbers of points, an error should now be thrown
      when you make the mapping in the :class:`VirtualLayout`,
      rather than later when writing this into the file. This
      should make it easier to find the source of such errors.
  * Deprecations
    * The default_file_mode config option is deprecated, and setting
      it to values other than 'r' (for read-only mode) is no longer
      allowed. Pass the mode when creating a :class:`.File` object
      instead of setting a global default.
  * Bug fixes
    * Trying to open a file in append mode ('a') should now give
      clearer error messages when the file exists but can't be opened.
    * Protect :func:`h5py.h5f.get_obj_ids` against garbage collection
      invalidating HDF5 IDs while it is retrieving them.
    * Make file closing more robust, including when closing files
      while the interpreter is shutting down, by using lower-level
      code to close HDF5 IDs of objects inside the file.
- Updates for version 3.2.0.
  * New features
    * Added support to use the HDF5 ROS3 driver to access HDF5 files
      on S3.
    * Breaking changes & deprecations
    * Setting the config option default_file_mode to values other
      than 'r' is deprecated. Pass the desired mode when opening a
      :class:`~.File` instead.
  * Exposing HDF5 functions
    * H5Pset_fapl_ros3 & H5Pget_fapl_ros3 (where HDF5 is built with
      read-only S3 support).
  * Bug fixes
    * :exc:`OSError` exceptions raised by h5py should now have a
      useful .errno attribute, where HDF5 provides this information.
      Subclasses such as :exc:`FileNotFoundError` should also be
      raised where appropriate.
    * Fix reading data with a datatype of variable-length arrays of
      fixed length strings.
    * Fix :meth:`.Dataset.read_direct` and :meth:`.Dataset.write_direct`
      when the source and destination have different shapes.
    * Fix selecting data using integer indices in
      :meth:`.Dataset.read_direct` and :meth:`.Dataset.write_direct`.
    * Fix exception handling in :meth:`.Group.visititems`.
    * Issue a warning when File(..., swmr=True) is specified with
      any mode other than 'r', as the SWMR option is ignored in
      these cases.
    * Fix NumPy 1.20 deprecation warnings concerning the use of
      None as shape, and the deprecated aliases np.float, np.int
      and np.bool.
  * 3.2.1 bug fix release
    * Fix :attr:`.File.driver` when the read-only S3 driver is
      available.

- specfile:
  * changed from 2to3 to six
  * added build requirement for python3-pkgconfig
  * added Cython requirement for install
  * update copyright year
- update to version 2.5.0:
  * Experimental SWMR support
  * Group and AttributeManager classes now inherit from the appropriate ABCs
  * Fixed an issue with 64-bit float VLENS
  * Cython warning cleanups related to "const"
  * Entire code base ported to "six"; 2to3 removed from setup.py
- update to version 2.4.0:
  * This release incorporates a total re-write of the identifier
    management system in h5py. As part of this refactoring, the entire
    API is also now protected by threading locks.
  * Files are now automatically closed when all objects within them
    are unreachable. Previously, if File.close() was not explicitly
    closed, files would remain open and "leaks" were possible if the
    File object was lost.
  * The entire API is now believed to be thread-safe (feedback
    welcome!).
  * External links now work if the target file is already
    open. Previously this was not possible because of a mismatch in
    the file close strengths.
  * The options to setup.py have changed; a new top-level "configure"
    command handles options like --hdf5=/path/to/hdf5 and
    --mpi. Setup.py now works correctly under Python 3 when these
    options are used.
  * Cython (0.17+) is now required when building from source.
  * The minimum NumPy version is now 1.6.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 10 14:28:44 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.0
  + This version of h5py introduces support for MPI/Parallel HDF5,
    using the mpi4py package.  Parallel HDF5 is the "native" method
    in HDF5 for sharing files and objects across multiple processes,
    in contrast to the "threading" package or "multiprocessing".
    There is a guide to using Parallel HDF5 at the h5py web site:
    http://www.h5py.org/docs/topics/mpi.html
  + Support for Python 3.3
  + Support for 16-bit "mini" floats
  + Access to the HDF5 scale-offset filter
  + Field names are now allowed when writing to a dataset
  + Region references now preserve the shape of their selections
  + File-resident "committed" types can be linked to datasets and attributes
  + Make object mtime tracking optional
  + A new "move" method on Group objects
  + Many new options for Group.copy
  + Access to HDF5's get_vfd_handle
  + Many bug fixes
- Remove depreciated %{py_requires}
- Remove redundant %clen section
- Remove useless %post/postun sections
