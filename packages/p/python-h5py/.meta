  <description>H5py provides a simple, robust read/write interface to HDF5 data from Python.                                                          
Existing Python and Numpy concepts are used for the interface; for example,                                                            
datasets on disk are represented by a proxy class that supports slicing, and                                                           
has dtype and shape attributes. HDF5 groups are presented using a dictionary                                                           
metaphor, indexed by name.</description>
