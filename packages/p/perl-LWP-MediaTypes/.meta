  <title>guess media type for a file or a URL</title>
  <description>This module provides functions for handling media (also known as MIME)
types and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is
defined by the _media.types_ file. If the _~/.media.types_ file exists it
is used instead. For backwards compatibility we will also look for
_~/.mime.types_.</description>
