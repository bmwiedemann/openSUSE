%description
websockify was formerly named wsproxy and was part of the
noVNC project.

At the most basic level, websockify just translates WebSockets traffic
to normal socket traffic. Websockify accepts the WebSockets handshake,
parses it, and then begins forwarding traffic between the client and
the target in both directions.
