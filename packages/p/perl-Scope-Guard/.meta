  <title>Lexically scoped resource management</title>
  <description>This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of
resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when
dealing with exceptions: the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to
a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the thread of execution
is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows lexically-scoped &quot;promises&quot;
to be made that are automatically honoured by perl's garbage collector.</description>
