%description
A utility package that includes:

  1. pyct.cmd: Makes various commands available to other
     packages. (Currently no sophisticated plugin system, just a try
     import/except in the other packages.) The same commands are
     available from within python. Can either add new subcommands to
     an existing argparse based command if the module has an existing
     command, or create the entire command if the module has no
     existing command. Currently, there are commands for copying
     examples and fetching data. See

  2. pyct.build: Provides various commands to help package
     building, primarily as a convenience for project maintainers.
