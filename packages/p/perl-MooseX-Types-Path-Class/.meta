  <title>A Path::Class Type Library for Moose</title>
  <description>MooseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Moose  types, coercions and option
specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as Moose attributes.

Coercions (see Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both 'Str' and
'ArrayRef' to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects. If you have
MooseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type (&quot;=s&quot;) will be added for both
Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.
