- update to version 2.0
  * Extracted new SimpleLockFile that removes implicit behavior 
    writing to the lock file, and instead allows a subclass to 
    define that behavior. 
  * SimpleLockFile and thus LockFile are now new-style classes. Any 
    clients relying on LockFile being an old-style class will need 
    to be adapted.
  * Drop support for Python 3.4.
  * Add support for Python 3.8b3.

    they wish.

    content.
