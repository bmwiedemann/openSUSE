    Doing so encourages using overly broad credentials.
    As a result, support for the corresponding AWS_BUCKET_ACL and
    AWS_AUTO_CREATE_BUCKET settings have been removed.

    URLs will only be signed if AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH is set to True
  * Automatic Google Cloud bucket creation has been removed.
    Doing so encourages using overly broad credentials.
