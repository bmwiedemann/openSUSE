  <title>post checks for build after rpms have been created</title>
  <description>some scripts to check for problems like test-installing the newly
created rpms and checking the logfile for errors.

This package will also set/change the following sysconfig variables, so
it may not be a good idea to install this to a running system:
/etc/sysconfig/security:PERMISSION_SECURITY=&quot;secure&quot;
/etc/sysconfig/clock:TIMEZONE=&quot;UTC&quot;</description>
