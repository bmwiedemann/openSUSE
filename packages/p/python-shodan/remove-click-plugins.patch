Subject: [PATCH] remove unmaintained click-plugins dependency

click-plugins is unmaintained for 6 years and incompatible with current
click 6.2.0 (https://github.com/click-contrib/click-plugins/issues/38)

click-plugins is not required to run shodan-python, only adds a
possibility for third parties to potentially hook into the cli interface.
if that's required, it needs to be done by other means

keeping the dependency to an unmaintained library is also a potential
security risk and prevents the usage of current versions of click itself
