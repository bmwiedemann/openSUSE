  <title>xSGE TMX Library</title>
  <description>xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU
General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features
to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to
have.

xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation.
They should work with any implementation that follows the specification.

This extension provides support for loading the Tiled TMX format.  This
allows you to use Tiled to edit your game's world (e.g. levels), rather
than building a level editor yourself.
