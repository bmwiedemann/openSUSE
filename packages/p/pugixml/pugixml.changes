Tue Apr 10 19:06:38 UTC 2018 - bjoern@schramke-online.de

- Update to version 1.9
  * Specification changes
    + xml_document::load(const char*) (deprecated in 1.5) now has 
      deprecated attribute; use xml_document::load_string instead
    + xml_node::select_single_node (deprecated in 1.5) now has 
      deprecated attribute; use xml_node::select_node instead 
  * New features
    + Add move semantics support for xml_document and improve 
      move semantics support for other objects
    + CMake build now exports include directories
    + CMake build with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON now uses dllexport 
      attribute for MSVC
  * XPath improvements
    + Rework parser/evaluator to not rely on exceptional control 
      flow; longjmp is no longer used when exceptions are disabled
    + Improve error messages for certain invalid expressions such 
      as .[1] or (1
    + Minor performance improvements
  * Compatibility improvements
    + Fix Texas Instruments compiler warnings
    + Fix compilation issues with limits.h for some versions of gcc
    + Fix compilation issues with Clang/C2
    + Fix implicit fallthrough warnings in gcc 7
    + Fix unknown attribute directive warnings in gcc 8
    + Fix cray++ compiler errors
    + Fix unsigned integer overflow errors with -fsanitize=integer
    + Fix undefined behavior sanitizer issues in compact mode

Thu Feb 16 15:32:17 UTC 2017 - joerg.lorenzen@ki.tng.de

- Update to version 1.8
  * Specification changes
    + When printing empty elements, a space is no longer added
      before / in format_raw mode.
  * New features
    + Added parse_embed_pcdata parsing mode in which PCDATA value
      is stored in the element node if possible (significantly
      reducing memory consumption for some documents).
    + Added auto-detection support for Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1)
      encoding during parsing.
    + Added format_no_empty_element_tags formatting flag that
      outputs start/end tags instead of empty element tags for
      empty elements.
  * Performance improvements
    + Minor memory allocation improvements (yielding up to 1%
      memory savings in some cases).
  * Compatibility improvements
    + Fixed compilation issues for Borland C++ 5.4.
    + Fixed compilation issues for some distributions of MinGW 3.8.
    + Fixed various Clang/GCC warnings.
    + Enabled move semantics support for XPath objects for MSVC
      2010 and above.

- Update to version 1.7
  * New integer parsing/formatting implementation
    + Functions that convert from and to integers (e.g. as_int/set_value)
      do not rely on CRT any more.
    + New implementation is 3-5x faster and is always correct wrt
      overflow or underflow. This is a behavior change - where previously
      as_uint() would return UINT_MAX on a value "-1", it now returns 0.
  * New features
    + XPath objects (xpath_query, xpath_node_set, xpath_variable_set)
      are now movable if your compiler supports C++11. Additionally,
      xpath_variable_set is copyable.
    + Added format_indent_attributes that makes the resulting XML friendlier
      to line diff/merge tools.
    + Added a variant of xml_node::attribute function with a hint that
      can improve lookup performance.
    + Custom allocation functions are now allowed (but not required)
      to throw instead of returning a null pointer.
  * Bug fixes
    + Fix Clang 3.7 crashes in out-of-memory cases (C++ DR 1748)
    + Fix xpath_node_set assignment to provide strong exception guarantee
    + Fix saving for custom xml_writer implementations that can throw from write()
- Add pugixml-config.patch to enable long long support, works better than
  enabling via build flags.

- Manually enable long long support 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 13:09:48 UTC 2015 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version bump to 1.6:
  * See manual.html for in-depth changelog
- Use %cmake macros properly

Thu Mar  5 06:44:51 UTC 2015 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.5 and prepare for submission to factory
  See bnc#905649 enable blender cycles. Pugixml needed by OpenImageIO
  needed by blender for cycles.

    as_int/as_uint/as_llong/as_ullong
  * Added xml_node::append_buffer to improve performance of assembling
    documents from fragments
