  <description>
pugixml is a light-weight C++ XML processing library. It features:

- DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities
- Extremely fast non-validating XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from
  an XML file/buffer
- XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries
- Full Unicode support with Unicode interface variants and automatic encoding
  conversions

The library is extremely portable and easy to integrate and use.
