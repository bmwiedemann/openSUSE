- update to 1.6.0:
  * Resolve an internal source of potential flakiness on the
    bind/close port
  * checks when used in active environments by calling
    `.shutdown()` before `.close()`.
  * Add `-h` and `--help` text to the command line tool.
  * The command line interface now defaults to associating the
    returned port with its parent process PID (usually the calling
    script) when no argument was given as that makes more sense.
  * When portpicker is used as a command line tool from a
    script, if a port is chosen without a portserver it can now
    be kept bound to a socket by a child process for a user
    specified timeout. When successful, this helps
    minimize race conditions as subsequent portpicker CLI
    invocations within the timeout window cannot choose the same
    port.
  * Some pylint based refactorings to portpicker and
    portpicker\_test.
  * Drop 3.6 from our CI test matrix and metadata. It probably
    still works there, but expect our unittests to include
    3.7-ism's in the future. We'll *attempt* to avoid modern
    constructs in portpicker.py itself but zero
    guarantees. Using an old Python? Use an old portpicker.

- update to 1.5.2:
  * Do not re-pick a known used (not-yet-returned) port when running stand alone
    without a portserver.
  * When not using a portserver *(you really should)*, try the `bind(0)`
    approach before hunting for random unused ports. More reliable per

- version update to 1.3.1
  * Fix a race condition in `pick_unused_port()` involving the free ports set.
  * Adds an optional `portserver_address` parameter to `pick_unused_port()` so
    that callers can specify their own regardless of `os.environ`.
  * `pick_unused_port()` now raises `NoFreePortFoundError` when no available port
    could be found rather than spinning in a loop trying forever.
  * Fall back to `socket.AF_INET` when `socket.AF_UNIX` support is not available
    to communicate with a portserver.
  * Introduced `add_reserved_port()` and `return_port()` APIs to allow ports to
    be recycled and allow users to bring ports of their own.
  * Changed default port range to 15000-24999 to avoid ephemeral ports.
  * Portserver bugfix.
