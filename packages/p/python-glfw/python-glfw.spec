%description
This module provides Python bindings for GLFW . It is a
ctypes wrapper which keeps very close to the original GLFW API,
except for:

-  function names use the pythonic ``words_with_underscores`` notation
   instead of ``camelCase``
-  ``GLFW_`` and ``glfw`` prefixes have been removed, as their function
   is replaced by the module namespace
-  structs have been replaced with Python sequences
-  functions like ``glfwGetMonitors`` return a list instead of a pointer
   and an object count
-  Gamma ramps use floats between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of unsigned shorts
-  GLFW errors are reported as ``glfw.GLFWError`` exceptions if no error
   callback is set (use ``glfw.ERROR_REPORTING=False`` to disable this)
