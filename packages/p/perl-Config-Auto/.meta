  <title>Magical config file parser</title>
  <description>This module was written after having to write Yet Another Config File
Parser for some variety of colon-separated config. I decided &quot;never again&quot;.

Config::Auto aims to be the most 'DWIM' config parser available, by
detecting configuration styles, include paths and even config filenames
automagically.

See the the HOW IT WORKS manpage section below on implementation details.</description>
