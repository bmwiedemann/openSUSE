Warning for users of Cyberjack utilities
========================================

Cyberjack utilities require exclusive access to the card reader. Ensure
that other applications accessing to your card reader are down. You
should especially check for pcscd and openct system services:

Start "YaST -> System -> System Services (Runlevel)" and disable these
services either temporarily or permanently (disabling access to the
smart card reader for software using these services).
