Wed May  8 06:08:53 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 8.2.0:
  * The strict option is now correctly respected when comparing nested
    objects.
  * When comparing datetime.datetime or datetime.time instances, if the fold
    is the only thing that's different, it's now shown in the output.
  * A more detailed exception is now raised when resolving a replacement
    doesn't give what's expected.
  * Replacement of methods on instances is now prevented when strict=True.
  * An exception is now raised when mocking and the original is not in the
    __dict__ of its containing objects.
  * Fix bug where replacement of methods on subclasses failed when using
    Replacer.on_class.
  * Implement strict comparison as an option for datetime.datetime
    and datetime.time.
  * Retire zope.component helpers.
  * Support bytes in popen.MockPopen commands.
  * Allow TempDirectory instances to be traversed as pathlib.Path objects.
  * Use the system default encoding where possible in TempDirectory.
  * Add TempDirectory option to manage current working directory.
  * Allow string class attributes to be replaced with Replacer and friends.
  * Fix nasty bug meaning some Replacer.on_class and Replacer.in_module
    replacements weren't restored.
  * Allow an alternative separator to be used for traversal during replacement
    with Replacer and friends.
  * Officially support Python 3.12.
  * Drop support Python 3.6.
- Add multibuild to break a cycle.
- Drop patch path-comparsion-312.patch, included upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 11 15:07:33 UTC 2023 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 29 01:50:24 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 7.2.2:
  * Fix bug in support for :class:`os.PathLike` arguments to
    :class:`popen.MockPopen`.
  * Added missing support for :class:`os.PathLike` arguments to
    :class:`popen.MockPopen`.
  * Add ``order_matters`` parameter to :class:`ShouldWarn`.
  * Implement new IDE and static-analysis ways of :doc:`mocking <mocking>`
    including additional parameters to :meth:`~Replacer.replace` along with
    the :any:`replace_on_class`, :any:`replace_in_module` and
    :any:`replace_in_environ` context managers.
- Add patch path-comparsion-312.patch:
  * Compare paths string-wise, due to Python 3.12 changes.

  * Remove py.typed file: neither mypy nor testfixtures are ready for this file to be present.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 19:29:23 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

  * Further bugfixes around self-referential datastructures and :func:`compare`.

- Update to 7.0.2 (1 Nov 2022)

    what's going on and also ignores more immutable data types.

- Update to 7.0.1 (1 Nov 2022)
  * Remove non-functional support for self-referential data structures in :func:`compare`. The functionality didn't work but did cause
    erroneous reported equality of values in dictionaries that were actually not equal. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    :class:`~.sybil.FileParser`.
  * Rename and refactor the date and time mocks, they are now :any:`mock_date`,
    :any:`mock_datetime` and :any:`mock_time`. :func:`test_date`,
    :func:`test_datetime` and :func:`test_time` are still present as aliases
    but are now deprecated.
  * Add :meth:`TempDirectory.as_string`, :meth:`TempDirectory.as_path` and
    :meth:`TempDirectory.as_local`. :meth:`TempDirectory.getpath` is now
    deprecated.
  * :class:`TempDirectory` can now be used to wrap existing directories.
  * Fixed a bug where :any:`OutputCapture.captured` returned bytes instead of a
    string with fd=True.
  * The deprecated strict option to :class:`Comparison` has been removed, use
    the partial option instead.
  * The deprecated :meth:`TempDirectory.check`, :meth:`TempDirectory.check_dir`
    and :meth:`TempDirectory.check_all` methods have been removed.

    :func:`compare` when mismatching values contained the same
    number more than once.
  * Add support for lazy resolution of prefix and suffix when using
    :func:`compare`.

  6.13.0 (18 Feb 2020)
  --------------------
  - Allow any attributes that need to be ignored to be specified directly when calling
    :func:`~testfixtures.comparison.compare_object`. This is handy when writing
    comparers for :func:`compare`.
  6.12.1 (16 Feb 2020)
  --------------------
  - Fix a bug that occured when using :func:`compare` to compare a string with a
    slotted object that had the same :func:`repr` as the string.

  - Add support for ``universal_newlines``, ``text``, ``encoding`` and ``errors`` to
    :class:`popen.MockPopen`, but only for Python 3.

  - :class:`decimal.Decimal` now has better representation when :func:`compare` displays a failed
    comparison, particularly on Python 2.

    are not recommended.
  6.10.3 (22 Nov 2019)

    when they were of different types.

    and a ``__dict__``.

  -------------------
  - Fix edge case where string interning made dictionary comparison output much less useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - :class:`ShouldRaise` no longer catches exceptions that are not of the required type.
  - Fixed a problem that resulted in unhelpful :func:`compare` failures when
    :func:`~unittest.mock.call` was involved and Python 3.6.7 was used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 08:14:30 UTC 2019 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 6.8.2
  * Fix handling of the latest releases of the :mod:`mock` backport.

    Python 3.7.

- from 6.6.1
  * Fixed bugs where using 'not_there' to ensure a key or attribute
    was not there but would be set by a test would result in the test
    attribute or key being left behind.
  * Add support for comparing functools.partial instances and fix
    comparison of functions and other objects where vars() returns
    an empty dict.
- from v6.6.0
  * Add the ability to ignore attributes of particular object types when
    using `compare`.
- from v6.5.2
