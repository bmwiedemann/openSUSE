Mon Feb 16 08:59:36 UTC 2026 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.16.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Sixel is now supported in all platform and enabled by default. The will
    break any build scripts that enable the sixel feature flag since that is
    now gone. Any maintainer that is building the package and enabling that
    flag should no longer do so (#828).
  New features:
  * Allow executing snippets inside a PTY. This allows you to run tools that
    move the cursor around and redraw the terminal inside a slide (e.g. top,
    htop, etc). (#781) (#794) (#809) (#788) (#808) (#807) (#789).
  * Use icy_sixel crate instead of sixel-rs. icy_sixel is a pure rust crate
    which simplifies code distribution and allows enabling sixel support by
    default (#818)
  * Add support for user comments in presentation rendering (#773).
  * Allow passing in a mermaid config file (#833).
  * Allow specifying mmdc puppeteer config path (#830) (#842).

  * Allow configuring code block line numbers at theme level (#771).
  * Allow setting prefix on slide titles (#739).
  * Allow configuring whether first h1 heading is slide title (#738) (#756).
  * Allow styling bold/italics (#737).
  * Respect pause in speaker notes (#735).
  * Add --list-comment-commands cli option (#723)
  * Allow setting headings to be bold/italics/underlined (#721).
  * Add typescript-react/tsx highlighting (#777)
  * Add dart code highlighting #779 (#780)
  * Add ms windows executors and highlight (cmd, wsl, bat, pwsh) (#799)
  * Add Elixir to executors (#709)
  * Support gdscript syntax highlighting (#820)
  Fixes:
  * Use right size for footer images (#840).
  * Don't crash when exporting +image snippets (#827).
  * Clippy useless conversion (#805)
  * Preserve footnote definition location (#803).
  * Respect global alignment for lists (#802).
  * Don't crash sending event if presentation is in error state (#800).
  * Highlight php code even if it doesn't start with "<?php" (#796).
  * Handle dark/light colors properly when converting from 8bt (#793).
  * Use legible color in tokyonight-day's block quote/alert style (#792).
  * Allow column layouts in included files (#776).
  * Use show_pauses in sample config (#745).
  * Don't consider prefix part of the title (#740).
  * Keep state between pauses on pause-new-slide (#731).
  * Don't add extra heading lines depending on font size (#719).
  * Consider color range 0x08.. - 0x0f.. in bat themes (#706).
  Chore:
  * Increase async render polling speed (#806).
  * Add script to generate config file json schema (#791).
  * Restructure snippet execution attributes (#787).
  * Bump dependencies (#772).
  * Unify text styling based on theme (#734).
  Docs:
  * Fix typo in config theme section (#804)
  * Fix typo in code execution docs (#782)
  * Sync supported terminals (#722)
  * Document overflow validation (#712).
  * Add new sample presentation about ratatui on embedded (#817)
  * Add new sample presentation about Hayasen library (#813)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  4 06:57:12 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.15.1:
  * Disable OSC 11 when running in tmux (#696).
  * Follow custom theme symlinks (#692).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 14 07:32:41 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.15.0:
  * Breaking changes
    The behavior for "jump next fast" and "jump previous fast" keybindings
    (defaults to n and p) now jumps straight from one slide to the
    next/previous one ignoring pauses. Before this used to "reveal" all pauses
    when jumping forward before going to the next slide. This behavior was
    weird and unintuitive so now fast jumps go straight into the next/previous
    slides. The action of "showing all pauses on the current slide" can now be
    done by pressing s (#678).
  New features:
  * Allow specifying where a snippet's execution output will go (#658).
  * Add include comment command to import markdown files (#651) (#683).
  * Allow validating snippets without explicitly executing them by using --validate-snippets switch (#645) (#637).
  * Support iterm2 image protocol when running in tmux (#661).
  * Add support for d2 diagrams (#657).
  * Errors encountered when parsing markdown now always display the file, line,
    and column where the error was found, as well as the markdown line that
    caused the error (#674) (#653) (#684) (#685).
  * Superscript via ^this^ and <sup>this</sup> syntaxes is supported when using
    the kitty terminal. For other terminals we try to use unicode half block
    characters which cover a portion of the ASCII charset. (#606)(#617 )
    (#665).
  * Allow alternative snippet executors for languages that support execution.
    This allows, for example, runnig rust code via rust-script or python code
    via pytest (#614).
  * Allow using env var PRESENTERM_CONFIG_FILE to point to the config file (#663)
  * Set background color via OSC 11 to avoid having a colored edge around the
    presentation (#623) (#624) (#627).
  * Add support for markdown footnotes (#616).
  * Runtime errors are now centered rather than being left aligned with some fixed margin (#638).
  * Allow configuring number of newlines in between list items (#628).
  * Allow 3 digit hex colors (#609)
  * Allow configuring font used in PDF export (#608).
  * Added uv as an alternative executor for python code (#662)
  * Allow multiline slide titles (#679).
  * Add support for multiline slide titles (#682)
  * Add support for multiline subtitle (#680)
  * Add support for syntax highlighting and execution for F# (#650)
  * Use text style/colors in rust-script errors (#644).
  * Added rust-script-pedantic alternative executor for rust (#640).
  Fixes:
  * Consider rect start row when capping max terminal rows (#656).
  * Skip speaker notes slide on skip_slide (#625).
  * Don't loop on 0 bytes read when querying capabilities (#620).
  * Make code snippet language specifiers case insensitive (#613)
  * Bump dependencies (#681)
  Chore:
  * Refactored code to make it more easily testeable, and added lots of tests
    to ensure markdown is rendered as expected. This will hopefully reduce the
    number of errors found after each release (#660) (#659) (#655) (#647).
  * Bump rust version to 1.82 (#611).
  * Perform better validation around matching HTML tags (#668).
  * Don't run nightly job if the git hash hasn't changed (#667) (#675) (#669).
  * Display an error when using http(s) urls in image tags (#666).
  * Update Catppuccin themes to use palettes (#672)
  Docs:
  * Add custom introduction slides example (#633).
  * Add mention of winget (#621)
  * Fix incorrect note callout (#610)
  * Add a note to export pdf using uv (#646)
  * Clarify why no remote urls work with images (#664)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  2 05:41:07 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14.0:
  New features:
  * Add support for exporting presentations as HTML files (#566) (#595) (#575) (#599)
  * Snippet execution output now contains configurable padding and built-in themes
    default to the same padding as snippets (2 spaces horizontally, one line
    vertically) (#592) (#593).
  * Add highlighting and execution support for Jsonnet (#585)
  * Allow configuring snippets to be executed sequentially during exports (#584).
  Fixes:
  * Skip slides with pauses correctly (#598).
  * Avoid printing text if there's no vertical space for it, which otherwise looks
    bad particularly when using font size > 1 (#594).
  * Execute snippets only once during export (#583).
  * Don't add an extra pause after lists if there's nothing left (#580).
  * Allow interleaved spans and variables in footer (#577).
  * Truly center +exec_replace snippet output (#572).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 25 13:28:01 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.13.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * The CLI parameter to generate the JSON schema for the config file
    (--generate-config-file-schema) is now hidden behind a json-schema
    feature flag. The JSON schema file for the latest version is already
    publicly available at
    https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm/blob/${VERSION}/config-file-schema.json,
    so anyone can use it without having to generate it by hand. This
    allows cutting down the number of dependencies in this project quite a bit (#563).
  New features:
  * Support for slide transitions is now available (#530):
    + Add fade slide transition (#534).
    + Add slide horizontally slide transition animation (#528).
    + Add collapse_horizontal slide transition (#560).
  * Add --output option to specify the path where the output file is written to during an export
  (#526).
  * Allow specifying start/end lines in file snippet type (#565)
  * Allow letting pauses become new slides when exporting (#557).
  * Allow using images on right in footer (#554).
  * Add max_rows configuration to cap vertical size (#531).
  * Add julia language highlighting and execution support (#561).
  Fixes:
  * Center overflow lines when using centered text (#546).
  * Don't add extra space before heading if prefix in theme is empty (#542).
  * Use no typst background in terminal-* built in themes (#535).
  * Use std::env::temp_dir in the external_snippet test (#533)
  * Respect extends in a theme set via path in front matter (#532).
  Misc:
  * Refactor async renders (e.g. mermaid/typst/latex +render blocks, +exec blocks, etc)
    to work truly asynchronously. This causes the output to be polled faster,
    and causes jumping to a slide that contains an async render to take a likely
    negligible (but maybe noticeable) amount of time to be jumped to. This
    was needed for slide transitions to work seemlessly (#556).
  * Get rid of textproperties (#529).
  * Add links to presentations using presenterm (#544)
  Performance improvements:
  * A few performance improvements had to be done for slide transitions to work seemlessly:
    + Pre-scale ASCII images when transitions are enabled (#550).
    + Pre-scale generated images (#553).
    + Cache resized ASCII images (#547).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 27 17:43:34 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.12.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Using incremental lists now adds an extra pause before and after a list.
    Use the defaults.incremental_lists configuration parameter to go
    back to the previous behavior (#487) (#498).
  New features:
  * PDF exports are now generated by invoking weasyprint rather than
    by using the now deprecated presenterm-export. This gets rid of the need
    for tmux and opens up the door for other export formats (#509) (#517).
  * PDF export dimensions can now also be specified in the config file
    rather than always having them inferred by the terminal size (#511).
  * Allow specifying path for temporary files generated during presentation export (#518).
  * Respect font sizes in generated PDF (#510).
  * Add skip_slide comment command to avoid including a slide in the final presentation (#505).
  * Add alignment comment command to specify text alignment for the
    remainder of a slide (#493) (#522).
  * Add --current-theme CLI parameter to display the theme being used (#489).
  * Add gruvbox dark theme (#483)
  Fixes:
  * Fix broken ANSI escape code parsing which would cause command output to
    sometimes be incorrectly parsed and therefore led to its colors/attributes not being respected (#500).
  * Center lists correctly (#512) (#520).
  * Respect end slide shorthand in speaker notes mode (#494).
  * Use more visible colors in snippet execution output in terminal-light/dark themes (#485).
  * Show error if sixel mode is selected but disabled (#525).
  Docs:
  * Fix typo in README.md (#490)
  * Correctly include layout pic (#495)
  Misc:
  * Cleanup text attributes (#519).
  * Refactor snippet processing (#484).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 10 07:30:11 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.11.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Footer templates are now sanitized, and any variables surrounded
    in braces that aren't supported (e.g. {potato}) will now cause
    presenterm to display an error. If you'd like to use braces in
    contexts where you're not trying to reference a variable you can
    use double braces, e.g. live at {{PotatoConf}} (#442) (#467) (#469) (#471).
  New features:
  * Add support for kitty's font size protocol. This is now used by
    default in built in themes in a few components such as the intro slide's
    title and slide titles. See the example presentation gif to check
    out how this looks like. Terminal suport for this feature is detected
    on startup and will be ignored if unsupported. This requires kitty >= 0.40.0 (#438) (#460) (#470).
  * Allow specifying font size in a comment command, which causes any
    subsequent text in a slide to use the specified font size. Just like
    the above, only supported in kitty >= 0.40.0 for now (#458).
  * Footers can now contain images in the left and center components.
    This allows including some form of branding/company logo to your presentations (#450) (#476).
  * Footers can now contain inline markdown, which allows using bold,
    italics, <span> tags for colors, etc (#466).
  * Presentation titles can now contain inline markdown (#464).
  * Introduce palette.classes in themes to allow specifying combinations
    of foreground/background colors that can be referenced via the class attribute in <span> tags (#468).
  * It's now possible to configure the alignment to use when max_columns
    is configured and the terminal width is larger than it (#475).
  * Add support for wikilinks (#448).
  Fixes:
  * Don't get stuck if tmux doesn't passthrough (#456).
  * Don't squash image if terminal's font aspect ratio is not 2:1 (#446).
  * Fail if --config-file points to non existent file (#474).
  * Use right script name for kotlin files when executing (#462).
  * Respect lists that start at non 1 indexes (#459).
  * Jump to right slide on code attribute change (#478).
  Improvements:
  * Remove result return type from builder fns that don't need it (#465).
  * Refactor theme code (#463).
  * Restructure terminal code and add test for margins/layouts (#443).
  * Use fastrand instead of rand (#441).
  * Avoid cloning strings when styling them (#440).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  7 08:30:01 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Default themes now no longer use a progress bar based footer.
    Instead they use indicator of the current page number and the
    total number of pages. If you'd like to preserve the old behavior,
    you can override the theme by using footer.style = progress_bar in your theme.
  * Links that include a title (e.g. [my title](http://example.com))
    now have their title rendered as well.
    Removing a link's title will make it look the same as they used to.
  New features:
  * Use "template" footer in built-in themes (#358).
  * Allow including external code snippets (#328) (#372).
  * Add +no_background property to remove background from code blocks (#363) (#368).
