Thu Mar 27 17:43:34 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.12.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Using incremental lists now adds an extra pause before and after a list.
    Use the defaults.incremental_lists configuration parameter to go
    back to the previous behavior (#487) (#498).
  New features:
  * PDF exports are now generated by invoking weasyprint rather than
    by using the now deprecated presenterm-export. This gets rid of the need
    for tmux and opens up the door for other export formats (#509) (#517).
  * PDF export dimensions can now also be specified in the config file
    rather than always having them inferred by the terminal size (#511).
  * Allow specifying path for temporary files generated during presentation export (#518).
  * Respect font sizes in generated PDF (#510).
  * Add skip_slide comment command to avoid including a slide in the final presentation (#505).
  * Add alignment comment command to specify text alignment for the
    remainder of a slide (#493) (#522).
  * Add --current-theme CLI parameter to display the theme being used (#489).
  * Add gruvbox dark theme (#483)
  Fixes:
  * Fix broken ANSI escape code parsing which would cause command output to
    sometimes be incorrectly parsed and therefore led to its colors/attributes not being respected (#500).
  * Center lists correctly (#512) (#520).
  * Respect end slide shorthand in speaker notes mode (#494).
  * Use more visible colors in snippet execution output in terminal-light/dark themes (#485).
  * Show error if sixel mode is selected but disabled (#525).
  Docs:
  * Fix typo in README.md (#490)
  * Correctly include layout pic (#495)
  Misc:
  * Cleanup text attributes (#519).
  * Refactor snippet processing (#484).

Mon Mar 10 07:30:11 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.11.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Footer templates are now sanitized, and any variables surrounded
    in braces that aren't supported (e.g. {potato}) will now cause
    presenterm to display an error. If you'd like to use braces in
    contexts where you're not trying to reference a variable you can
    use double braces, e.g. live at {{PotatoConf}} (#442) (#467) (#469) (#471).
  New features:
  * Add support for kitty's font size protocol. This is now used by
    default in built in themes in a few components such as the intro slide's
    title and slide titles. See the example presentation gif to check
    out how this looks like. Terminal suport for this feature is detected
    on startup and will be ignored if unsupported. This requires kitty >= 0.40.0 (#438) (#460) (#470).
  * Allow specifying font size in a comment command, which causes any
    subsequent text in a slide to use the specified font size. Just like
    the above, only supported in kitty >= 0.40.0 for now (#458).
  * Footers can now contain images in the left and center components.
    This allows including some form of branding/company logo to your presentations (#450) (#476).
  * Footers can now contain inline markdown, which allows using bold,
    italics, <span> tags for colors, etc (#466).
  * Presentation titles can now contain inline markdown (#464).
  * Introduce palette.classes in themes to allow specifying combinations
    of foreground/background colors that can be referenced via the class attribute in <span> tags (#468).
  * It's now possible to configure the alignment to use when max_columns
    is configured and the terminal width is larger than it (#475).
  * Add support for wikilinks (#448).
  Fixes:
  * Don't get stuck if tmux doesn't passthrough (#456).
  * Don't squash image if terminal's font aspect ratio is not 2:1 (#446).
  * Fail if --config-file points to non existent file (#474).
  * Use right script name for kotlin files when executing (#462).
  * Respect lists that start at non 1 indexes (#459).
  * Jump to right slide on code attribute change (#478).
  Improvements:
  * Remove result return type from builder fns that don't need it (#465).
  * Refactor theme code (#463).
  * Restructure terminal code and add test for margins/layouts (#443).
  * Use fastrand instead of rand (#441).
  * Avoid cloning strings when styling them (#440).

Mon Oct  7 08:30:01 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * Default themes now no longer use a progress bar based footer.
    Instead they use indicator of the current page number and the
    total number of pages. If you'd like to preserve the old behavior,
    you can override the theme by using footer.style = progress_bar in your theme.
  * Links that include a title (e.g. [my title](http://example.com))
    now have their title rendered as well.
    Removing a link's title will make it look the same as they used to.
