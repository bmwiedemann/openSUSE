- add py313.patch, py314.patch: fixes for python 3.13 and 3.14

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 08:54:06 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.7.2:
  * Add support for formatting of `ExceptionGroup` errors (#805).
  * Fix possible `RuntimeError` when using
    `multiprocessing.set_start_method()` after importing the
    `logger` (#974).
  * Fix formatting of possible `__notes__` attached to an
    `Exception` (#980).
- update to 0.7.1:
  * Add a new `context` optional argument to `logger.add()`
    specifying `multiprocessing` context (like `"spawn"` or
    `"fork"`) to be used internally instead of the default one
  * Add support for true colors on Windows using ANSI/VT console
    when available (#934, thanks @tunaflsh).
  * Fix possible deadlock when calling `logger.complete()` with
    concurrent logging of an asynchronous sink (#906).
  * Fix file possibly rotating too early or too late when re-
    starting an application around midnight (#894).
  * Fix inverted `""` and `""` color tags
  * Fix possible untraceable errors raised when logging non-
    unpicklable `Exception` instances while using `enqueue=True`
  * Fix possible errors raised when logging non-picklable
    `Exception` instances while using `enqueue=True` (#342,
    thanks @ncoudene).
  * Fix missing seconds and microseconds when formatting timezone
    offset that requires such accuracy
  * Raise `ValueError` if an attempt to use nanosecond precision
    for time formatting is detected

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 12 13:31:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- drop optional mypy testing dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  5 12:35:44 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.7.0:
  * Update `InterceptHandler` recipe to make it compatible with
    Python 3.11 (#654).
  * Add a new `watch` optional argument to file sinks in order to
    automatically re-create possibly deleted or changed file
    (#471).
  * Make `patch()` calls cumulative instead of overriding the
    possibly existing patching function (#462).
  * Make sinks added with `enqueue=True` and `catch=False` still
    process logged messages in case of internal exception (#833).
  * Avoid possible deadlocks caused by re-using the logger inside
    a sink, a signal handler or a `__del__` method. Since the
    logger is not re-entrant, such misuse will be detected and
    will now generate a `RuntimeError` (#712, thanks
    @jacksmith15).
  * Fix file sink rotation using an aware `datetime.time` for
    which the timezone was ignored (#697).
  * Fix logs colorization not automatically enabled for Jupyter
    Notebook and Google Colab (#494).
  * Fix logs colorization not automatically enabled for Github
    Actions and others CI platforms (#604).
  * Fix `logger.complete()` possibly hanging forever when
    `enqueue=True` and `catch=False` if internal thread killed
    due to `Exception` raised by sink (#647).
  * Fix incompatibility with `freezegun` library used to simulate
    time (#600).
  * Raise exception if `logger.catch()` is used to wrap a class
    instead of a function to avoid unexpected behavior (#623).
- drop python311.patch, loguru-fix-repr-tests.patch: upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 11:11:57 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.6.0
  * Remove internal use of pickle.loads() considered as a security
    vulnerability referenced as CVE-2022-0329 (#563).
  * Modify coroutine sink to make it discard log messages when
    loop=None and no event loop is running (due to internally using
    asyncio.get_running_loop() in place of
    asyncio.get_event_loop()).
  * Remove the possibility to add a coroutine sink with
    enqueue=True if loop=None and no event loop is running.
  * Change default encoding of file sink to be utf8 instead of
    locale.getpreferredencoding() (#339).
  * Prevent non-ascii characters to be escaped while logging JSON
    message with serialize=True (#575, thanks @ponponon).
  * Fix flake8 errors and improve code readability (#353, thanks
    @AndrewYakimets).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  8 22:31:43 UTC 2021 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update t0 v0.5.3
  * Fix child process possibly hanging at exit while combining
    enqueue=True with third party library like uwsgi
  * Fix possible exception during formatting of non-string messages
- from v0.5.2
  * Fix AttributeError within handlers using serialize=True when
    calling logger.exception() outside of the context of an exception
  * Fix error while logging an exception containing a non-picklable
    value to a handler with enqueue=True
  * Add support for async callable classes used as sinks
- from v0.5.1
  * Modify the way the extra dict is used by LogRecord in order to
    prevent possible KeyError with standard logging handlers
  * Add a new default optional argument to logger.catch(), it should
    be the returned value by the decorated function in case an
    error occurred
  * Fix ValueError when using serialize=True in combination with
    logger.catch() or logger.opt(record=True) due to circular
    reference of the record dict
- from v0.5.0
  * Remove the possibility to modify the severity no of levels
    once they have been added in order to prevent surprising
    behavior
  * Add better support for "structured logging" by automatically
    adding **kwargs to the extra dict besides using these arguments
    to format the message. This behavior can be disabled by setting
    the new .opt(capture=False) parameter
  * Add a new onerror optional argument to logger.catch(), it should
    be a function which will be called when an exception occurs in
    order to customize error handling
  * Add a new exclude optional argument to logger.catch(), is should
    be a type of exception to be purposefully ignored and propagated
    to the caller without being logged
  * Modify complete() to make it callable from non-asynchronous
    functions, it can thus be used if enqueue=True to make sure
    all messages have been processed
  * Fix possible deadlocks on Linux when multiprocessing.Process()
    collides with enqueue=True or threading
  * Fix compression function not executable concurrently due to file
    renaming (to resolve conflicts) being performed after and not
    before it
  * Fix the filter function listing files for retention being too
    restrictive, it now matches files based on the pattern
    "basename(.*).ext(.*)"
  * Fix the impossibility to remove() a handler if an exception is
    raised while the sink' stop() function is called
  * Fix file sink left in an unstable state if an exception occurred
    during retention or compression process
  * Fix situation where changes made to record["message"] were
    unexpectedly ignored when opt(colors=True), causing
    "out-of-date" message to be logged due to implementation details
  * Fix possible exception if a stream having an isatty() method
    returning True but not being compatible with colorama is used
    on Windows
  * Fix exceptions occurring in coroutine sinks never retrieved and
    hence causing warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 10:44:04 UTC 2021 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- BuildRequire python36-aiocontextvars if building under python 3.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 16 09:14:36 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.4.1
  * Deprecate the ansi parameter of .opt() in favor of colors
    which is a name more appropriate.
  * Prevent unrelated files and directories to be incorrectly
    collected thus causing errors during the retention process
  * Strip color markups contained in record["message"] when
    logging with .opt(ansi=True) instead of leaving them as is.
  * Ignore color markups contained in *args and **kwargs when
    logging with .opt(ansi=True), leave them as is instead of
    trying to use them to colorize the message which could cause
    undesirable errors.
- Update to version 0.4.0
  * Add support for coroutine functions used as sinks and add the
    new logger.complete() asynchronous method to await them.
  * Add a way to filter logs using one level per module in the
    form of a dict passed to the filter argument.
  * Add type hints to annotate the public methods using a .pyi
    stub file.
  * Add support for copy.deepcopy() of the logger allowing multiple
    independent loggers with separate set of handlers.
  * Add the possibility to convert datetime to UTC before
    formatting (in logs and filenames) by adding "!UTC" at the end
    of the time format specifier.
  * Add the level name as the first argument of namedtuple returned
    by the .level() method.
  * Remove class objects from the list of supported sinks and
    restrict usage of **kwargs in .add() to file sink only. User is
    in charge of instantiating sink and wrapping additional keyword
    arguments if needed, before passing it to the .add() method.
  * Rename the logger.configure() keyword argument patch to patcher
    so it better matches the signature of logger.patch().
  * Fix AttributeError while using a file sink on some distributions
    (like Alpine Linux) missing the os.getxattr and os.setxattr
    functions.
  * Fix values wrongly displayed for keyword arguments during
    exception formatting with diagnose=True.
  * Fix logging messages wrongly chopped off at the end while using
    standard logging.Handler sinks with .opt(raw=True).
  * Fix an error using a filter function "by name" while receiving
    a log with record["name"] equals to None.
  * Fix incorrect record displayed while handling errors
    (if catch=True) occurring because of non-picklable objects
    (if enqueue=True).
  * Prevent hypothetical ImportError if a Python installation is
    missing the built-in distutils module.
  * Raise TypeError instead of ValueError when a logger method is
    called with argument of invalid type.
  * Raise ValueError if the built-in format() and filter() functions
    are respectively used as format and filter arguments of the
    add() method. This helps the user to understand the problem, as
    such a mistake can quite easily occur.
  * Remove inheritance of some record dict attributes to str (for
    "level", "file", "thread" and "process").
  * Give a name to the worker thread used when enqueue=True
