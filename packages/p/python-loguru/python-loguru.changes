- Update to version 0.4.1
  * Deprecate the ansi parameter of .opt() in favor of colors
    which is a name more appropriate.
  * Prevent unrelated files and directories to be incorrectly
    collected thus causing errors during the retention process
  * Strip color markups contained in record["message"] when
    logging with .opt(ansi=True) instead of leaving them as is.
  * Ignore color markups contained in *args and **kwargs when
    logging with .opt(ansi=True), leave them as is instead of
    trying to use them to colorize the message which could cause
    undesirable errors.
- Update to version 0.4.0
  * Add support for coroutine functions used as sinks and add the
    new logger.complete() asynchronous method to await them.
  * Add a way to filter logs using one level per module in the
    form of a dict passed to the filter argument.
  * Add type hints to annotate the public methods using a .pyi
    stub file.
  * Add support for copy.deepcopy() of the logger allowing multiple
    independent loggers with separate set of handlers.
  * Add the possibility to convert datetime to UTC before
    formatting (in logs and filenames) by adding "!UTC" at the end
    of the time format specifier.
  * Add the level name as the first argument of namedtuple returned
    by the .level() method.
  * Remove class objects from the list of supported sinks and
    restrict usage of **kwargs in .add() to file sink only. User is
    in charge of instantiating sink and wrapping additional keyword
    arguments if needed, before passing it to the .add() method.
  * Rename the logger.configure() keyword argument patch to patcher
    so it better matches the signature of logger.patch().
  * Fix AttributeError while using a file sink on some distributions
    (like Alpine Linux) missing the os.getxattr and os.setxattr
    functions.
  * Fix values wrongly displayed for keyword arguments during
    exception formatting with diagnose=True.
  * Fix logging messages wrongly chopped off at the end while using
    standard logging.Handler sinks with .opt(raw=True).
  * Fix an error using a filter function "by name" while receiving
    a log with record["name"] equals to None.
  * Fix incorrect record displayed while handling errors
    (if catch=True) occurring because of non-picklable objects
    (if enqueue=True).
  * Prevent hypothetical ImportError if a Python installation is
    missing the built-in distutils module.
  * Raise TypeError instead of ValueError when a logger method is
    called with argument of invalid type.
  * Raise ValueError if the built-in format() and filter() functions
    are respectively used as format and filter arguments of the
    add() method. This helps the user to understand the problem, as
    such a mistake can quite easily occur.
  * Remove inheritance of some record dict attributes to str (for
    "level", "file", "thread" and "process").
  * Give a name to the worker thread used when enqueue=True
