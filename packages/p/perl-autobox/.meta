  <title>call methods on native types</title>
  <description>The autobox pragma allows methods to be called on integers, floats,
strings, arrays, hashes, and code references in exactly the same manner as
blessed references.

The autoboxing is transparent: boxed values are not blessed into their
(user-defined) implementation class (unless the method elects to bestow
such a blessing) - they simply use its methods as though they are.

The classes (packages) into which the native types are boxed are fully
configurable. By default, a method invoked on a non-object is assumed to be
defined in a class whose name corresponds to the 'ref()' type of that value
- or SCALAR if the value is a non-reference.</description>
