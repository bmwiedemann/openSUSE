%description
This module tries to provide a coherent API to bring together the various
JSON modules currently on CPAN. This module will allow you to code to any
JSON API and have it work regardless of which JSON module is actually
installed.

    use JSON::Any;

    my $j = JSON::Any->new;

    $json = $j->objToJson({foo=>'bar', baz=>'quux'});
    $obj = $j->jsonToObj($json);

or

    $json = $j->encode({foo=>'bar', baz=>'quux'});
    $obj = $j->decode($json);

or

    $json = $j->Dump({foo=>'bar', baz=>'quux'});
    $obj = $j->Load($json);

or

    $json = $j->to_json({foo=>'bar', baz=>'quux'});
    $obj = $j->from_json($json);

or without creating an object:

    $json = JSON::Any->objToJson({foo=>'bar', baz=>'quux'});
    $obj = JSON::Any->jsonToObj($json);

On load, JSON::Any will find a valid JSON module in your @INC by looking
for them in this order:

    Cpanel::JSON::XS
    JSON::XS
    JSON::PP
    JSON
    JSON::DWIW

And loading the first one it finds.

You may change the order by specifying it on the 'use JSON::Any' line:

    use JSON::Any qw(DWIW XS CPANEL JSON PP);

Specifying an order that is missing modules will prevent those module from
being used:

    use JSON::Any qw(CPANEL PP); # same as JSON::MaybeXS

This will check in that order, and will never attempt to load JSON::XS,
JSON.pm/JSON, or JSON::DWIW. This can also be set via the
'$ENV{JSON_ANY_ORDER}' environment variable.

JSON::Syck has been deprecated by its author, but in the attempt to still
stay relevant as a "Compatibility Layer" JSON::Any still supports it. This
support however has been made optional starting with JSON::Any 1.19. In
deference to a bug request starting with JSON.pm 1.20, JSON::Syck and other
deprecated modules will still be installed, but only as a last resort and
will now include a warning.

    use JSON::Any qw(Syck XS JSON);

or

    $ENV{JSON_ANY_ORDER} = 'Syck XS JSON';

At install time, JSON::Any will attempt to install JSON::PP as a reasonable
fallback if you do not appear have *any* backends installed on your system.

WARNING: If you call JSON::Any with an empty list

    use JSON::Any ();

It will skip the JSON package detection routines and will die loudly that
it couldn't find a package.
