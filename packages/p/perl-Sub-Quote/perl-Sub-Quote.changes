   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Sub-Quote/Changes

  2.006006 - 2019-10-01
    - change quotify to use longest form of floating point numbers if unable to
      find a perfectly accurate representation
    - updated documentation for quotify to reflect handling of floating point
      numbers
    - don't try to copy hints hash entries that look like references (RT#122698)
  
  2.006_005 - 2019-09-06
    - additional fixes for quotify for floating point numbers to be faster and
      should always be able to maintain accuracy
  
  2.006_004 - 2019-04-24
    - change quotify of NaNs to simpler calculation
    - avoid ever triggering exceptions when testing for quotify on false values
    - skip quotify Inf and NaN tests if perl is compiled without support for
      them
    - fix quotify of very large or very small numbers
    - fix accuracy of quotify on high precision numbers when perl is compiled
      with quadmath
    - quotify will use hex floats when needed for full accuracy if they are
      available
    - change tests of quotify for floating point numbers to allow a small amount
      of inaccuracy, since decimal floats can't always be accurate

    - fix quoting of negative NaN
  
  2.006_000 - 2018-12-29

    - preserve inf, nan, and false in quotify
    - improve accuracy of quotified floating point numbers
    - SUB_QUOTE_DEBUG can now be set to sub names, package names, or a regex to
      match against the code to filter which generated subs are printed to STDERR.

- updated to 2.005000
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Sub-Quote/Changes

  2.005000 - 2018-02-06
    - fixed defer_info and undefer_sub from returning data for a deferred sub
      after it expires, even if the ref address matches
    - fixed defer_info not returning info for undeferred unnamed subs after the
      deferred sub expires
    - include options in defer_info return data
    - exclude internals from defer_info return data
    - document defer_info function
    - encode all utf8 flagged scalars as strings, since they generally will
      always have originated as strings.  Avoids future warning on bitwise ops
      on strings with wide characters.
    - more thorough check for threads availability to avoid needless test
      failures.
    - added file and line options to quote_sub to allow specifying apparent
      source location.

      Sub::Quote::quote_sub.
