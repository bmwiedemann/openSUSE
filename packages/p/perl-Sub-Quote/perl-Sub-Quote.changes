- updated to 2.005000
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Sub-Quote/Changes

  2.005000 - 2018-02-06
    - fixed defer_info and undefer_sub from returning data for a deferred sub
      after it expires, even if the ref address matches
    - fixed defer_info not returning info for undeferred unnamed subs after the
      deferred sub expires
    - include options in defer_info return data
    - exclude internals from defer_info return data
    - document defer_info function
    - encode all utf8 flagged scalars as strings, since they generally will
      always have originated as strings.  Avoids future warning on bitwise ops
      on strings with wide characters.
    - more thorough check for threads availability to avoid needless test
      failures.
    - added file and line options to quote_sub to allow specifying apparent
      source location.
    - documented additional options to Sub::Defer::defer_sub and
      Sub::Quote::quote_sub.
