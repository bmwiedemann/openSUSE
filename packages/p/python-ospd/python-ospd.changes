- Update to version 20.8.0
  Added
  * Add solution method to solution of vt object.
  * Add wait_for_children().
  * Extend osp to accept target options.
  * Accept reverse_lookup_only and reverse_lookup_unify target's
    options.
  * Add 'total' and 'sent' attributes to element for <get_vts>
    cmd response.
  * Add new get_memory_usage command.
  * Add lock-file-dir configuration option.
  * Add details attribute to get_vts command.
  * Add pontos as dev dependency for managing the version
    information in ospd.
  * Add more info about scan progress with progress attribute in
    get_scans cmd.
  * Add support for scan queuing
  * Extend results with optional argument URI
  * Add new scan status INTERRUPTED.
  * Extend get_vts with attribute version_only and return the
    version.
  * Allow to set all openvas parameters which are not strict
    openvas only parameters via osp.
  Changes
  * Modify init() method and use new syntax for super().
  * Create data manager and spawn new process to keep the vts
    dictionary.
  * Update daemon start sequence. Run daemon.check before
    daemon.init now.
  * Improve get_vts cmd response, sending the vts piece by piece.
  * Start the server before initialize to respond to the client.
  * Use an iterator to get the vts when get_vts cmd is called.
  * Update license to AGPL-3.0+
  * Replaced pipenv with poetry for dependency management. poetry
    install works a bit different then pipenv install. It installs
    dev packages by default and also ospd in editable mode. This
    means after running poetry install ospd will directly be
    importable in the virtual python environment.
  * Progress bar calculation does not take in account the dead
    hosts.
  * Show progress as integer for get_scans.
  * Make scan_id attribute mandatory for get_scans.
  * Ignore subsequent SIGINT once inside exit_cleanup().
  * Simplify start_scan()
  * Make ospd-openvas to shut down gracefully
  * Do not add all params which are in the OSPD_PARAMS dict to the
    params which are set as scan preferences.
  Fixed
  * Fix stop scan. Wait for the scan process to be stopped before
    delete it from the process table.
  * Fix get_scanner_details().
  * Fix thread lib leak using daemon mode for python 3.7.
  * Fix scan progress in which all hosts are dead or excluded.
  * Stop all running scans before exiting.
  * Fix start of parallel queued task.
  * Strip trailing commas from the target list.
  Removed
  * Remove support for resume task.
