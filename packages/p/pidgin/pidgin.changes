    pidgin-branding-upstream (with Provides, Conflicts, Supplements
    that are usual for a branding package).

      you click them.
    - Fix embedding in the system tray on older GTK+ releases (such
      as on CentOS 5.5 and older Fedora).

      notification support. GTK+ has included support for years, so
      use it instead.
  + AIM:
    - Fix a bug where some buddies from your buddy list might not
      show up. Affected non-English ICQ users the most.
    - Send keepalives for all types of network connections. Will
      hopefully make chat rooms more reliable.

    - Fix bug that prevented added buddies to your buddy list in
      certain circumstances.

    - Extend the /join command to support room JIDs, enabling you
      to join a room on any server.

      joining a room (not currently supported by Pidgin and Finch).
  + Yahoo!/Yahoo! JAPAN:
    - Fix CVE-2011-1091, denials of service caused by NULL pointer
      dereferences due to improper handling of malformed YMSG
      packets.

- Add pidgin-fix-perl-build.patch to fix the build: some change
  upstream was apparently wrong, and we'll need to investigate this
  later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 12 19:42:22 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:
  + %desktop_database_post/postun because the package ships at
    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.
- Pass %{?no_lang_C} to %find_lang so that english documentation
  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.
- Change Requires of lang subpackage to Recommends, since the
  english documentation is not there anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      transport type.
    - Handle Connection: Close headers for BOSH, when the server

      the request is cancelled locally.

    - ICQ accounts using clientLogin now use the correct ICQ
      servers.  This is separate from the server settings

      showing a request with an icon. Fixes receiving MSN file
      transfer requests including a thumbnail in Finch.
    - Fix an invalid memory access when removing UPnP mappings that
      could cause sporadic crashes, most notably when MSN Direct
      Connections are enabled.

      certificates suggesting the user check their computer's date
      and time.

      plugin to provide Evolution integration with contacts with
      Gadu-Gadu IDs.

      Video Settings plugin.
    - Use GRegex for the debug window where available. This brings

      offer Stream ID.
    - Added support for using Google's relay servers when making
      voice and video calls to Google clients.
    - Fix detecting file transfer proxies advertised by the server.
    - Advertise support for Google Talk's JID Domain Discovery

    - Improved handling of adding oneself to your buddy list when
      using Non-SASL (legacy) authentication.
    - Generate a connection error instead of just stalling when
      the _xmppconnect TXT record returns results, but none of them
      result in a valid BOSH URI.
  + Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
    - Stop doing unnecessary lookups of certain alias information.
      This solves deadlocks when a given Yahoo account has a
      ridiculously large (>500 buddies) list and may improve login
      speed for those on slow connections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 08:57:31 CET 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- Updated to version 2.6.6:
  + libpurple:
    - Fix a quirk in purple_markup_html_to_xhtml that caused some
      messages to be improperly converted to XHTML.
    - Set "controlling-mode" correctly when initializing a media
      session. Fixes receiving voice calls from Psi.
    - When looking up DNS records, use the type of record returned
      by the server (instead of the type we asked for) to determine
      how to process the record.
    - Fix an issue with parsing XML attributes that contain
      "&lt;br&gt;". See ChangeLog.API for more details.
  + General:
    - Correctly disable all missing dependencies when using the
      --disable-missing-dependencies option.
  + Gadu-Gadu:
    - Fix display of avatars after a server-side change.
  + AIM:
    - Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100
      pixels. Previously only icons between 48x48 and 50x50 were
      allowed.
  + MSN:
    - Fix CVE-2010-0277, a possible remote crash when parsing an
      incoming SLP message.
    - File transfer requests will no longer cause a crash if you
      delete the file before the other side accepts.
    - Received files will no longer hold an extra lock after
      completion, meaning they can be moved or deleted without
      complaints from your OS.
    - Buddies who sign in from a second location will no longer
      cause an unnecessary chat window to open.
    - Support setting an animated GIF as a buddy icon.
    - Numerous code cleanups and memory savings.
  + MySpace:
    - Fix a leak and crash when retrieving buddy icons.
  + XMPP:
    - Less likely to send messages to a contact's idle/inactive
      resource. Previously, if a message was received from a
      specific resource, responses would be sent to that resource
      until either it went offline or a message is received from
      another resource. Now, messages are sent to the bare JID upon
      receipt of any presence change from the contact.
    - Added support for the SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism. This is
      only available when built without Cyrus SASL support.
    - When getting info on a domain-only (server) JID, show uptime
      (when given by the result of the "last query") and don't show
      status as offline.
    - Fix getting info on your own JID.
    - Wrap XHTML messages in <p>, as described in XEP-0071, for
      compatibility with some clients.
    - Don't do an SRV lookup for a STUN server associated with the
      account if one is already set globally in prefs.
    - Don't send custom smileys larger than the recommended maximum
      object size specified in the BoB XEP. This prevents a client
      from being disconnected by servers that dislike overly-large
      stanzas.
    - Fix receiving messages without markup over an Openfire BOSH
      connection (forcibly put the stanzas in the jabber:client
      namespace).
    - The default value for the file transfer proxies is
      automatically updated when an account connects, if it is
      still the old (broken) default (from 'proxy.jabber.org' to
      'proxy.eu.jabber.org').
    - Fix an issue where libpurple created duplicate buddies if the
      roster contains a buddy in two groups that differ only by
      case (e.g. "XMPP" and "xmpp") (or not at all).
  + Yahoo:
    - Don't send <span> and </span> tags.
    - Support PingBox. PingBoxes will appear as pbx/PingBoxName.
  + Pidgin:
    - Fix CVE-2010-0423, a denial of service attack due to the
      parsing of large numbers of smileys.
    - Correctly size conversation and status box entries when the
      interior-focus style property is diabled.
    - Correctly handle a multiline text field being required in a
      request form.
    - Search friends by email-addresses in the buddy list.
    - Allow dropping an image on Custom Smiley window to add a new
      one.
    - Prompt for confirmation when clearing a whiteboard (doodle)
      session.
    - Use the "hand" cursor when hovering over usernames in chat
      history to indicate that the username is an actionable item.
    - Double-clicking usernames in chat history will open an IM
      with that user.
    - Put an icon on the "Filter" button in the debug window.
    - Don't treat "/messages/like/this " as commands.
    - Explicitly mark user interaction when inserting smilies from
      the toolbar so "Undo" correctly removes these smilies.
    - Clicking "New" or "Saved" in the status selector menu while
      typing a status message no longer keeps the status entry area
      stuck in "typing" mode forever.
    - Show tooltips for ellipsized conversation tabs. On older
      systems, tooltips will show for all tabs.
    - The File Transfers and Debug Window windows are no longer
      created as dialogs. These windows should now have minimize
      buttons in many environments in which they were previously
      missing (including Windows).
    - Smiley themes with Windows line endings no longer cause theme
      descriptions not to be displayed in the theme selector.
  + Finch:
    - Fix CVE-2010-0420, a possible remote crash when handling chat
      room buddy names.
    - Rebindable 'move-first' and 'move-last' actions for tree
      widgets. So it is possible to jump to the first or last entry
      in the buddy list (and other such lists) by pressing home or
      end key (defaults)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + AIM and ICQ:
    - Messages from some mobile clients are no longer displayed as
      Chinese characters (broken in 2.6.4)

      files from a libpurple client. (CVE-2010-0013, bnc#567799)

    - Do not crash when attempting to register for a new account on
      Windows.
    - Fix file transfer with clients that do not support Entity
      Capabilities (e.g. Spark)
- Disabled GNOME keyring integration for openSUSE (bnc#566286).

    editing your AIM or ICQ account. (Paul Aurich)
  * Fix a memory leak in SILC. (Luke Petre)
  * Fix some string handling in the SIMPLE prpl, which fixes some buddy name
    handling and other issues. (Paul Aurich, Marcus Sundberg)
  * Implement support for resolving DNS via the SOCKS4 proxy (SOCKS4a).
  ICQ:
  * Fix retrieval of status messages from users of ICQ 6.x, Miranda, and
    other libpurple clients. (Daniel Ljungborg)
  * Change client ID to match ICQ Basic 14.34.3096.  This fixes publishing
    of buddy icons and available messages.
  * Properly publish status messages for statuses other than Available.
    ICQ 6.x users can now see these status messages. (Daniel Ljungborg)
  * Fix receipt of messages from the mobile client Slick. (David Jedelsky)
  MSN:
  * Fix transfer of buddy icons, custom smileys, and files from the
    latest Windows Live Messenger 9 official client. (Thomas
    Gibson-Robinson)
  * Large (multi-part) messages are now correctly re-combined.
  * Federated/Yahoo! buddies should now stop creating sync issues at
    every signin.  You may need to remove duplicates in the Address
    Book.  See the FAQ for more information.  Thanks to Jason Lingohr
    for lots of debugging and testing.
  * Messages from Yahoo! buddies are no longer silently dropped.
  * We now save and use the CacheKey for ABCH SOAP requests.
  * Don't try to parse Personal Status Messages or Current Media if they
    don't exist.
  * Convert from ISO-8859-1 encoding to UTF-8 when no charset is specified
    on incoming messages.  This should fix some issues with messages from
    older clients.
  * Force sending the font "Segoe UI" if outgoing formatting doesn't specify
    a font already.
  * Queue callbacks when token updates are in progress to prevent two token
    update attempts from trampling each other.
  * Fixed a crash on Windows when removing a buddy's alias.
  * Update the Address Book when buddies' friendly names change.  This
    prevents seeing an outdated alias or not seeing an alias at all for
    buddies who are offline when you sign in.
  * Update tokens for FindMembership and ABFindAll SOAP requests.
  * We no longer try to send empty messages.  This could happen when a
    message contained only formatting and that formatting was not supported
    on MSN.
  * Buddies on both the Allow and Block list are now automatically
    removed from the Allow list.  Users with this problem will now no
    longer receive an ADL 241 error.  The problematic buddy should now
    appear on the buddy list and can be removed or unblocked as desired.
  XMPP:
  * Resources using __HOSTNAME__ substitution will now grab only the short
    hostname instead of the FQDN on systems which put the FQDN in the
    hostname. (Matěj Cepl)
  * No longer send a 'to' attribute on an outgoing stanza when we haven't
    received one.  This fixes a registration bug as described in ticket
    pidgin#6635.
  Pidgin:
  * Tooltip windows now appear below the mouse cursor. (Kosta Arvanitis)
  * Tooltip windows now disappear on keypress events. (Kosta Arvanitis)
  * Tooltip windows no longer linger when scrolling the buddy list. (Kosta
    Arvanitis)
  Finch:
  * Allow rebinding keys to change the focused widget (details in the
    man-page, look for GntBox::binding)

  + http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.1

Sat Dec  1 13:38:28 CST 2007 - maw@suse.de

- Update to version 2.3.0:
  + http://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.0
  + libpurple:
    * real usernames shown in system log
    * honor a PURPLE_DISABLE_DEPRECATED define to allow plugins to
      catch deprecated functions earlier rather than later.
    * Thanks to a patch from Intel, the Bonjour prpl now supports file
      transfers using XEP-0096 and XEP-0065.  This should enable file
      transfers between libpurple clients and Gajim clients, but will not
      work with iChat or Adium as they use a different file transfer
      implementation.
    * XMPP password changes that return errors no longer cause the saved
      password to be changed.
    * XMPP file transfer support has been enhanced to support sending
      files through a proxy when the server supports discovering a
      a bytestream proxy.  This should make file transfers much more
      reliable.  The next release will add support for manually specifying
      a proxy when the server doesn't advertise one.
  + pidgin:
    * If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
      remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
      at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
      could lead to crashes.
    * Mark dialog windows as transient for appropriate parent windows to
      help window managers do the right thing  (Gabriel Schulhof)
    * Connection errors are now reported in mini-dialogs inside the buddy
      list, rather than as buttons in the buddy list and with dialog
      boxes.  If several accounts are disabled when you sign on elsewhere,
      you can now re-enable them all with a single click.
    * Added tooltips to the Room List window to show full topics
    * Added buttons in preferences to access GNOME network and browser
      preferences configuration dialogs when running under GNOME
    * If you alias a buddy to an alias that is already present within
      a particular group, we now offer to merge the buddies into the
      same contact.
    * A music emblem is now displayed in the buddy list for a buddy if we
      know she is listening to some soothing music.
    * Added a 'Move to' menu in buddy list context menu for moving buddies
      to other groups as an alternative to dragging.
    * Group headings are now marked via an underline instead of a
      different color background.
    * It is now possible to mark a chat on your buddy list as "Persistent"
      so you do not leave the chat when the window or tab is closed.
    * The auto-join option for chats is now listed in the "Add Chat"
      dialog along with the new persistence option.
    * Closing an IM no longer immediately closes your conversation.  It
      will now remain active for a short time so that if the conversation
      resumes, the history will be retained.  A preference has been added
      to toggle this behavior.
    * The "Smiley" menu has been moved to the top-level of the toolbar.
    * Pidgin's display is now saved with the command line for session
      restoration.  (David Mohr)
    * ICQ Birthday notifications are shown as buddy list emblems.
    * Plugin actions are now available from the docklet context menu
      in addition to the Tool menu of the buddy list.
    * The manual page has been heavily rewritten to bring it in line
      with current functionality.
  + Finch:
    * If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
      remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
      at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
      could lead to crashes.
    * It's possible to bind key-strokes to specific menuitems in the windows.
      Read the 'Menus' section in the man-page for details.
    * 'transpose-chars' operation for the entry boxes. The default key-binding
      is ctrl+t.
    * 'yank' operation for the entry boxes. The default binding is ctrl+y.
