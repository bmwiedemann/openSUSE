  <title>Glib Perl module</title>
  <description>This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject libraries. 
GLib is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a generic
type system with inheritance and a powerful signal system.  Together
these libraries are used as the foundation for many of the libraries
that make up the Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated
projects.</description>
