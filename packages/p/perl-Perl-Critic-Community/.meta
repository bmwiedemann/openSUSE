  <title>Community-inspired Perl::Critic policies</title>
  <description>A set of Perl::Critic policies to enforce the practices generally recommended by subsets of the Perl community, particularly on IRC. Formerly known as Perl::Critic::Freenode. Because this policy &quot;theme&quot; is designed to be used with zero configuration on the command line, some duplication will occur if it is used in combination with core Perl::Critic policies.</description>
