%description
Pycha is a Python package for drawing charts using the Cairo library.
It will not try to draw any possible chart on Earth, but draw the
most common ones nicely. Pycha is based on the Plotr which is based on
PlotKit, both of which are written in JavaScript and are for client
web programming. Pycha was developed for the server side.
