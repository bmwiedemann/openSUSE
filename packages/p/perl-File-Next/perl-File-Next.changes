      [SPEEDUP]
      Updated the internals to minimize the number of times that stat()
      gets called on each file or directory.
  
      [FIXES]
      t/from_file.t would fail under Windows because File::Temp would
      put a backslash in front of the name of the tempfile.  Thanks,
      Varadinsky. (GH#32)
  
      Had to specify a minimum version of File::Temp.  Thanks, Justin Mohr.
      (GH#29)

      [FIXES]
      File::Next::from_file() would ignore the C<warning_handler> argument
      if it was passed in.

      No changes since 1.13_02.
  
  
  1.13_02 Sun Jun  5 23:18:10 CDT 2016
  
      [FIXES]
      t/follow.t would cause failures in other tests when running in
      parallel.  Now it correctly uses a temp directory.
  
  
  1.13_01 Mon May 30 21:45:42 CDT 2016
      [FIXES]
      File::Next::from_file() was incorrectly using the error_handler parm
      for both error and warning handler.
  
      [INTERNAL]
      Optimized -f/-p calls in files() to not repeat the variable.
  
      Use File::Temp in tests, not POSIX::tmpnam, so that it works
      on Android.  See https://github.com/petdance/file-next/issues/18
      Thanks, Brian Fraser.

- updated to 1.12
     [FIXES]
     Fix detection of named pipes under various flavors of BSD.
 
 
     [ENHANCEMENTS]
     Added the warning_handler argument to File::Next::from_file().
     This is so from_file() can throw a warning if a non-existent
     file is in the file it came from.
 
     [FIXES]
     from_file() should return undef if the file can't be opened.
 
     Fixed test failures and made tests more portable.
 
 
     [ENHANCEMENTS]
     Added File::Next::from_file() to get the list of files to iterate
     over from a file, or from STDIN.
 
     Named pipes are now supported.
 
     [INTERNAL]
     Add more tests, and clean up some Perl::Critic warnings.

- update to perl-File-Next-1.06
  * Fixed closing =cut in POD.
- update to perl-File-Next-1.04
  * It's never been correct to call File::Next::files() as a
    method, as File::Next->files(). Now, if you do, files() will
    die with an error. This is also the case with dirs() and
    everything(). Thanks to Eric Lyons for reporting.
  * Tiny directory reading speedups.
  * Updated URLs for support sites.
  * Added a little note about the follow_symlinks=>0 being a
    speed hit.
