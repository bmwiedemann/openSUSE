  <title>Google's robust Diff Match and Patch algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text.</title>
  <description>   1. Diff:
          * Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.
          * Diff Demo 
   2. Match:
          * Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
          * Match Demo 
   3. Patch:
          * Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.
          * Patch Demo </description>
