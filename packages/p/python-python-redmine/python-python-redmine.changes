Wed Jun 11 20:46:04 UTC 2025 - Lubos Kocman <lubos.kocman@suse.com>

- Add sle15_python_module_python to support newer python3 on Leap

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 19:14:48 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.0
  Deprecations:
  * Requests version required >= 2.31.0
  New Features:
  * Pro Edition: RedmineUP Products plugin support
  * Issue copying (see docs for details)
  Improvements:
  * dir(resource) and list(resource) now also show properties of
    an object.
  * Support for issues_assigned and issues_authored relations in
    User object
  * Original filename will be used as a filename for all uploaded
    files if a path was provided and filename wasn't set.
  * Pro Edition: Added support for RedmineUP Contact avatar
    add/update operations (see docs for details).
  * Pro Edition: Added support for RedmineUP DealCategory create(),
    update(), delete() operations (see docs for details).
  * Pro Edition: RedmineUP CrmQuery resource now supports
    invoices and expenses relation attributes.
  * PerformanceWarning will be issued when Python-Redmine does some
    unnecessary redirects before the actual request is made.
  Changes:
  * Backwards Incompatible: API key is now being sent in the
    X-Redmine-API-Key header instead of the key GET parameter which
    makes things more secure in case of a failed connection, but
    it might created issues for servers that don't do custom
    request header forwarding by default, so be sure to check your
    web server before upgrading (Issue #328 and Issue #330).
  * Backwards Incompatible: User all operation now really returns
    all users, i.e. not only active, but locked, registered and
    anonymous as well instead of only returning just active users
    in previous versions due to the respect to Redmine's standard
    behaviour.
  Bugfixes:
  * Tests were failing on Python 3.12 (Issue #332).
  * Some closed Issues weren't converted to Resource objects
    using redmine.search().
  * Pro Edition: RedmineUP Invoice resource order attribute was
    returned as a dict instead of being converted to Resource
    object.
  * Pro Edition: RedmineUP CrmQuery resource deals and contacts
    relation attributes didn't work.
  * Pro Edition: RedmineUP DealStatus resource deals relation
    attribute didn't work.
  Documentation:
  * Mentioned support for author_id in Issue's resource filter
    operation.
- Drop not longer needed patches
  * 328.patch
  * support-python-312.patch

  described in boo#1215722
  https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/330
  https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/pull/328

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 21 21:29:52 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.4.0
  New Features:
  * Timezone support.
  Improvements:
  * Added support for Python 3.10, 3.11 and latest PyPy
  * Added support for `allowed_statuses` to ``include`` param and
    on demand includes for Issue resource.
  * Added support for `issue_custom_fields` to ``include``
    param and on demand includes for Project resource.
  - Added support for `comments` and `attachments` to ``include``
    param and on demand includes for News resource.
  * Added support for Project ``close()``, ``reopen()``,
    ``archive()``, ``unarchive()`` operations.
  * Added support for updating and deleting issue journals.
  Backwards Incompatible Changes:
  * Switched to pytest instead of nose as nose project is dead
  * Removed usage of distutils.LooseVersion internally since it
    became deprecated and caused warnings, because of that all
    version info internally is now being represented as tuples
    and not strings as before.
  Bugfixes:
  * Stop raising `ResourceAttrError` for attributes that actually
    exist, but their value is `None`.
  * Project resource ``default_assignee`` attribute was returned
    as a dict instead of being converted to Resource object.
  * Project resource ``time_entry_activities`` attribute was
    returned as a list instead of being converted to ResourceSet
    object.

- Update to version 2.3.0
  * Support custom filename in ``redmine.upload()``
  * Support for ``get()`` and ``update()`` operations for ``/my/account`` endpoint which doesn't require admin
    privileges by using ``me`` as an id, i.e. ``redmine.user.get('me')`` or ``redmine.user.update('me',firstname='John')``
    (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * News ``create()``, ``update()``, ``delete()`` operations support (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * ResourceSet's ``export()`` method now supports ``columns`` keyword argument which can be either an iterable
    of column names, an "all" string which tells Python*Redmine to export all available columns, "all_gui" string
    for GUI like behaviour or iterable of elements with "all_gui" string and additional columns to export
  * Added support for special characters in WikiPage titles (`Issue #222 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/
    issues/222>`__) (thanks to `Radek Czajka <https://github.com/rczajka>`__)
  * Added ``return_response`` and ``ignore_response`` parameters to engine which allow to skip response processing
    and speed up the create/update/delete operation in case response body isn't needed (see
    `docs <https://python*redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html#session>`__ for details)
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Requests version required >= 2.23.0

    some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the clients code
    problems

    and make it an external dependency as Requests did the same with
    it's own dependencies
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 2.6 and 3.3 support as
    they're not supported by Requests anymore
  Bugfixes:
