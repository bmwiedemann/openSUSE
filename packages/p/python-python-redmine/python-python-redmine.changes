- Update to version 2.3.0
  * Support custom filename in ``redmine.upload()``
  * Support for ``get()`` and ``update()`` operations for ``/my/account`` endpoint which doesn't require admin
    privileges by using ``me`` as an id, i.e. ``redmine.user.get('me')`` or ``redmine.user.update('me',firstname='John')``
    (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * News ``create()``, ``update()``, ``delete()`` operations support (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * ResourceSet's ``export()`` method now supports ``columns`` keyword argument which can be either an iterable
    of column names, an "all" string which tells Python*Redmine to export all available columns, "all_gui" string
    for GUI like behaviour or iterable of elements with "all_gui" string and additional columns to export
  * Added support for special characters in WikiPage titles (`Issue #222 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/
    issues/222>`__) (thanks to `Radek Czajka <https://github.com/rczajka>`__)
  * Added ``return_response`` and ``ignore_response`` parameters to engine which allow to skip response processing
    and speed up the create/update/delete operation in case response body isn't needed (see
    `docs <https://python*redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html#session>`__ for details)
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Requests version required >= 2.23.0
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 3.4 support as it's not supported by Requests anymore
- Drop apparently obsolete python-python-redmine-use-system-requests.patch

Thu Feb 28 14:20:48 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.2.1
  Bugfixes:
  * ProjectMembership resource ``group`` attribute was returned as
    a dict instead of being converted to Resource object
- Update to version 2.2.0
  Improvements:
  * ``PerformanceWarning`` will be issued when Python-Redmine does
    some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the clients code
    problems

  Changes:
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed vendored Requests package
    and make it an external dependency as Requests did the same with
    it's own dependencies
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 2.6 and 3.3 support as
    they're not supported by Requests anymore
  Bugfixes:
  * ``Redmine.upload()`` fails under certain circumstances when used
    with a file-like object and it contains unicode instead of bytes
  * - ``Redmine.session()`` doesn't restore previous engine if fails
- Update patch:
  * python-python-redmine-use-system-requests.patch
