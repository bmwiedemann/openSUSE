- Update to version 2.4.0
  New Features:
  * Timezone support.
  Improvements:
  * Added support for Python 3.10, 3.11 and latest PyPy
  * Added support for `allowed_statuses` to ``include`` param and
    on demand includes for Issue resource.
  * Added support for `issue_custom_fields` to ``include``
    param and on demand includes for Project resource.
  - Added support for `comments` and `attachments` to ``include``
    param and on demand includes for News resource.
  * Added support for Project ``close()``, ``reopen()``,
    ``archive()``, ``unarchive()`` operations.
  * Added support for updating and deleting issue journals.
  Backwards Incompatible Changes:
  * Switched to pytest instead of nose as nose project is dead
  * Removed usage of distutils.LooseVersion internally since it
    became deprecated and caused warnings, because of that all
    version info internally is now being represented as tuples
    and not strings as before.
  Bugfixes:
  * Stop raising `ResourceAttrError` for attributes that actually
    exist, but their value is `None`.
  * Project resource ``default_assignee`` attribute was returned
    as a dict instead of being converted to Resource object.
  * Project resource ``time_entry_activities`` attribute was
    returned as a list instead of being converted to ResourceSet
    object.

Wed Aug  5 09:33:59 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.3.0
  * Support custom filename in ``redmine.upload()``
  * Support for ``get()`` and ``update()`` operations for ``/my/account`` endpoint which doesn't require admin
    privileges by using ``me`` as an id, i.e. ``redmine.user.get('me')`` or ``redmine.user.update('me',firstname='John')``
    (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * News ``create()``, ``update()``, ``delete()`` operations support (requires Redmine >= 4.1.0)
  * ResourceSet's ``export()`` method now supports ``columns`` keyword argument which can be either an iterable
    of column names, an "all" string which tells Python*Redmine to export all available columns, "all_gui" string
    for GUI like behaviour or iterable of elements with "all_gui" string and additional columns to export
  * Added support for special characters in WikiPage titles (`Issue #222 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/
    issues/222>`__) (thanks to `Radek Czajka <https://github.com/rczajka>`__)
  * Added ``return_response`` and ``ignore_response`` parameters to engine which allow to skip response processing
    and speed up the create/update/delete operation in case response body isn't needed (see
    `docs <https://python*redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html#session>`__ for details)
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Requests version required >= 2.23.0
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 3.4 support as it's not supported by Requests anymore
- Drop apparently obsolete python-python-redmine-use-system-requests.patch

- Update to version 2.2.1
  Bugfixes:
  * ProjectMembership resource ``group`` attribute was returned as
    a dict instead of being converted to Resource object
- Update to version 2.2.0
  Improvements:
  * ``PerformanceWarning`` will be issued when Python-Redmine does
    some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the clients code
    problems

  Changes:
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed vendored Requests package
    and make it an external dependency as Requests did the same with
    it's own dependencies
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 2.6 and 3.3 support as
    they're not supported by Requests anymore
  Bugfixes:
  * ``Redmine.upload()`` fails under certain circumstances when used
    with a file-like object and it contains unicode instead of bytes
  * - ``Redmine.session()`` doesn't restore previous engine if fails
