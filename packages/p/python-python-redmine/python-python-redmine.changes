- Update to version 2.2.1
  Bugfixes:
  * ProjectMembership resource ``group`` attribute was returned as
    a dict instead of being converted to Resource object
- Update to version 2.2.0
  Improvements:
  * ``PerformanceWarning`` will be issued when Python-Redmine does
    some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the clients code
    problems

  Changes:
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed vendored Requests package
    and make it an external dependency as Requests did the same with
    it's own dependencies
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 2.6 and 3.3 support as
    they're not supported by Requests anymore
  Bugfixes:
  * ``Redmine.upload()`` fails under certain circumstances when used
    with a file-like object and it contains unicode instead of bytes
  * - ``Redmine.session()`` doesn't restore previous engine if fails

  * python-python-redmine-use-system-requests.patch
