%description
This package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions in
the DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software from Python.

It supports creating a graph object, assembling the graph by adding nodes and
edges, and retrieving its DOT source code string, saving the source code to a
file and rendering it with the Graphviz installation.

Using the view option/method, the resulting (PDF, PNG, SVG, etc.) file can be
inspected with its default application. Graphs can also be rendered and
displayed within IPython notebooks.
