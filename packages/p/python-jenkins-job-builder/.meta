  <title>Configure Jenkins using YAML files</title>
  <description>Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many similarly configured jobs is easy.</description>
