%description
``scandir()`` is a directory iteration function like ``os.listdir()``,
except that instead of returning a list of bare filenames, it yields
``DirEntry`` objects that include file type and stat information along
with the name. Using ``scandir()`` increases the speed of ``os.walk()``
by 2-20 times (depending on the platform and file system) by avoiding
unnecessary calls to ``os.stat()`` in most cases.

``scandir`` has been included in the Python 3.5 standard library as
``os.scandir()``, and the related performance improvements to
``os.walk()`` have also been included. So if you're lucky enough to be
using Python 3.5 (release date September 13, 2015) you get the benefit
immediately, otherwise just
`download this module from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir>`_,
install it with ``pip install scandir``, and then do something like
this in your code::

    # Use the built-in version of scandir/walk if possible, otherwise
    # use the scandir module version
    try:
        from os import scandir, walk
    except ImportError:
        from scandir import scandir, walk

`PEP 471 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/>`_, which is the
PEP that proposes including ``scandir`` in the Python standard library,
was `accepted <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2014-July/135561.html>`_
in July 2014 by Victor Stinner, the BDFL-delegate for the PEP.

This ``scandir`` module is intended to work on Python 2.6+ and Python
3.2+ (and it has been tested on those versions).
