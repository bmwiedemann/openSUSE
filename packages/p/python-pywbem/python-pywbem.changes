- Update to Version 1.1.1
  * for a full HUGE changelog see
    https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/stable_1.1/changes.html
- remove coverage runs
- the cli is now in python-pywbemtools
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 12:31:48 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 0.17.2:
  - Fixed raise error for invalid reference_direction in
    WBEMServer.get_central_instances(). (See issue #2187)
  - Fixed raise error for missing ports in WBEMListener.__init__().
    (See issue #2188)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 14 10:50:52 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 0.17.1:
  - Fixed version incompatibilities reported by pip for tox/pluggy,
    ipython/prompt-toolkit, and flake8/pyflakes. (See issue #2153)
  - Fixed the issue where formatting the timezone name of
    a pywbem.MinutesFromUTC object raised NotImplementedError,
    by adding a tzname() method. (see issue #2160)
  - Increased minimum version of ‘six’ from 0.10.0 to 0.12.0
    when on Python 3.8 (or higher). (See issue #2150).
  - Increased minimum version of ‘setuptools’ on Python 3.7
    to 38.4.1 to fix a bug with new format of .pyc files. (See issue #2167).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  6 11:50:43 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 0.17.0:
  - Dev: Fixed installation of Jupyter Notebook on Python 3.4 by defining
    the appropriate minimum versions of the ipython package,
    per Python version. (See issue #2135)
  - Changed the HTTPS support of pywbem.WBEMListener from using
    the deprecated ssl.wrap_socket() function to using the
    ssl.SSLContext class that was introduced in Python 2.7.9.
    This causes more secure SSL settings to be used.
    (See issue #2002)
  - Renamed all sub-modules within the pywbem namespace so they are
    now private (i.e. with a leading underscore).
    This has been done for consistency with the upcoming 1.0.0
    version of pywbem (See issue #1925)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 16:59:28 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 0.16.0:
  - Silenced the MOFCompiler class for verbose=False.
  - Fixed that the MOFCompiler could be created with handle=None to
    work against a local repository. It was documented that way,
    but failed with AttributeError
  - Fixed the error that the MOF compilation of a class could fail but
    the error was not surfaced. This only happened when the MOF compiler
    was invoked against a WBEM server, when the class already existed,
    and when the ModifyClass operation that was attempted in
    this case, failed.
  - Fixed that the CIM-XML payload in log entries was spread over
    multiple lines. The payload is now escaped as a single-line
    Python string.
  - Fixed handling of Unicode string in ca_certs parm of
    WBEMConnection on py2

- removed upstreamed patches:
  - silenced_MOFCompiler.patch
  - unittest2-just-say-no.patch

  tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  6 14:22:55 CET 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.15.0:
  - This release deprecates the wbemcli command. Pywbem 1.0.0
    will remove the wbemcli command. The recommended replacement
    is the pywbemcli command from the pywbemtools package on
    Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/pywbemtools/
  - Further changes are presented on
    https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/stable_0.15/changes.html#pywbem-0-15-0

- Update to 0.8.2
  * Eliminated dependency on "six" package during installation of
    pywbem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 21 07:45:18 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- dropped python-pywbem-doc package, see http://pywbem.github.io

- rename 'wbemcli' to 'pywbemcli' to prevent conflict with
  sblim-wbemcli.

- Update to 0.8.1
  See http://pywbem.github.io/pywbem/doc/0.8.1/changelog.html for
  the complete list of changes.

  Known issues:
  * Installing PyWBEM on Python 2.6 has a conflict with the 'pbr'
    package from PyPI, resulting in a TypeError: "dist must be a
    Distribution instance". This issue is specific to Python 2.6 and
    does not occur in any of the other supported Python versions
    (2.7, 3.4, 3.5). This issue can be mitigated by uninstalling
    the 'pbr' package, or if that is not possible, by migrating
    to Python 2.7. See issue #26 on GitHub.
  * MOF using names that are reserved keywords will fail to compile
    in the MOF compiler. For example, a CIM property named
    'indication'. See issue #62 on GitHub.
  * The Pulled Enumeration Operations introduced in DSP0200 1.3 are
    not supported in this release. See issue #9 on GitHub.
  * Note that some components of this PyWBEM Client package are still
    considered experimental:
    - The twisted client module twisted_client.py.
    - The Python provider modules cim_provider.py and cim_provider2.py.
    - The CIM indication listener in the irecv directory. See issue
      #66 on GitHub.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 23 10:07:13 UTC 2015 - kkaempf@suse.com

- Splitted documentation off as python-pywbem-doc

- Update to 0.8.0~dev (development pre-release)

  * Verify certificates against platform provided CA trust store in
    /etc/pki/tls/certs. Linux only.  (Peter Hatina)

  * Added '-d' option to MOF compiler that causes the compiler to perform a
    dry-run and just check the MOF file syntax. This allows to more easily
    detect included MOF files when used together with the '-v' option.
    (Jan Safranek)

  * Added support for non-ASCII (Unicode) characters.  (Michal Minar, Andreas
    Maier)
      
  * Improved information in the message text of some exceptions (TypeError
    and KeyError in cim_obj.py, ValueError in cim_obj.py, and ParseError in
    tupleparse.py).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Moved the definition of the pywbem version from setup.py to __init__.py,
    in order to make it available to programs using pywbem as
    pywbem.__version__.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for direct iteration over NocaseDict objects using 'for'
    and 'in' by adding __iter__(), e.g. for use with CIMInstance.properties.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added more instance attributes to be shown in repr() on CIMProperty and
    other classes in cim_obj.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added and improved docstring-based documentation in the pywbem modules
    cim_operations, cim_http, cim_obj, cim_types, and the pywbem module.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the way missing file:// URL support on Windows is handled, by
    now issuing a proper error message instead of stumbling across the
    missing socket.AF_UNIX constant.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the way missing OWLocal authorization with the OpenWBEM server
    is handled on Windows, by now issuing a proper error message instead of
    stumbling across the missing os.getuid() function.  (Andreas Maier)
      
  * Improved Windows portability by no longer attempting to import 'pwd' in
    case the userid is not set in the environment variables that are checked
    when the WBEM server is local.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for ExecQuery operation to twisted client.  (Robert Booth)

  * Added get() methods on CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName to step up to the
    statement that they behave like dictionaries w.r.t. properties and key
    bindings.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved help text of test_cim_operations.py test program.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added an optional Params argument to InvokeMethod(), that is an ordered
    list of CIM input parameters, that preserves its order in the CIM-XML
    request message. This is to accomodate deficient WBEM servers that do
    not tolerate arbitrary order of method input parameters as required by
    the standard. The new argument is optional, making this a backwards
    compatible change of InvokeMethod().  (Andreas Maier)

  * Cleaned up the public symbols of each module by making symbols private
    that are used only internally. Specifically, the following symbols have
    been made private: In cimxml_parse: _get_required_attribute,
    _get_attribute, _get_end_event, _is_start, _is_end. In cim_xml: _text
    (was: Text).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Cleaned up symbols imported by wildcard import by defining __all__ in
    each module with only the public symbols defined in that module (removing
    any symbols imported into the module), except for the following modules
    which define less than the complete set of public symbols in their
    __all__: mof_compiler, twisted_client, tupleparse, cimxml_parse,
    cim_http.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for using CDATA section based escaping in any requests sent
    to the WBEM server. The default is still XML entity reference based
    escaping, the CDATA based escaping can be turned on by setting the switch
    _CDATA_ESCAPING accordingly, which is a global variable in the cim_xml
    module.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Simplified the exceptions that can be raised by WBEMConnection methods,
    and improved the information in the exception messages. See description
    of WBEMConnection class for details.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for timeouts to WBEMConnection, via a new timeout argument,
   that defaults to no timeout.  (This finally increased the minimum version
   of Python to 2.6.  (Andreas Maier)

  BUG FIXES:

  * Fix syntax error in CIM DTDVERSION error path.  Allow KEYVALUE
    VALUETYPE attribute to be optional as specified in the DTD.
    (Andreas Linke)

  * Added parsing of InvokeMethod return value and output parameters for
    Twisted Python client.  (Tim Potter)

  * Fixed cim_provider2.py to properly support shutdown() and can_unload()
    (called from CMPI cleanup() functions).  Support was recently added
    to cmpi-bindings for this.  (Bart Whiteley)

  * Fixed XML parsing to accept SFCB-style embedded instance parameters.
    (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Use getpass module instead of pwd to detect local user to fix Win32.
    (Tim Potter)

  * Re-throw KeyError exceptions with capitalised key string instead
    of lower cased version in NocaseDict.__getitem__().  (Tim Potter)

  * Use base64.b64encode() instead of base64.encodestring() in Twisted
    client. (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Fix missing CIMDateTime import in Twisted client.  (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Fixed CIMInstanceName rendering to string. It is now possible to pass the
    rendered string value as an instance path argument of a CIM method.
    (Jan Safranek, Michal Minar)

  * For Python providers, fixed the comparsion of the Role parameter in
    association operations to be case insensitive, and removed an erroneous
    test that raised an exception when the property specified in the Role
    parameter was not also in the property list specified by the Properties
    parameter.  (Jan Safranek)

  * For Python providers, converted debug 'print' statements to trace
    messages that end up in the system log.  (Jan Safranek)

  * The CIM-XML parser no longer throws an exception when parsing a
    qualifier declaration.
    Note: The CIM-XML supported by this fix does not conform to DSP0201 so
    far. Further fixes are pending.  (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed parsing errors for connection URLs with IPv6 addresses, including
    zone indexes (aka scope IDs).  (Peter Hatina, Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the hard coded socket addressing family used for HTTPS that was
    incorrect in some IPv6 cases, by determining it dynamically.
    (Peter Hatina)

  * Fixed the list of output parameters of extrinsic method calls to be
    returned as a case insensitive dictionary (using cim_obj.NocaseDict).
    (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed the checking of CIMVERSION attributes in CIM-XML to only verify the
    major version, consistent with DSP0201 (see subclause 5.2.1, in DSP0201
    version 2.3.1).  (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed error in cim_http.py related to stronger type checking of Python
    2.7. (Eduardo de Barros Lima)

  * Removed erroneous qualifier scopes SCHEMA and QUALIFIER from the MOF
    compiler (see DSP0004).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed debug logging of CIM-XML payload (that is, conn.last_*request/reply
    attributes) for extrinsic method calls, to now be consistent with
    intrinsic method calls.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) error when validating peer's
    certificate.  (Michal Minar)

  * Added a check in the CIMInstanceName constructor that the 'classname'
    argument is not None.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a tuple
    for the 'value' argument was incorrectly detected to be a scalar (and not
    an array).  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a
    datetime or timedelta typed value resulted in storing the provided object
    in the 'value' attribute, instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime
    object.  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a datetime
    formatted string typed 'value' argument along with type='datetime'
    resulted in storing the provided string object in the 'value' attribute,
    instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime object.  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed several cases in the CIMProperty constructor of unnecessarily
    requiring the optional arguments 'type', 'is_array', 'embedded_object',
    or 'reference_class'. These optional arguments are now only necessary to
    be provided if they cannot be implied from provided arguments (mainly
    from 'value').  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that an 'embedded_object'
    argument value of 'object' was changed to 'instance' when a CIMInstance
    typed 'value' argument was also provided.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that the first array
    element was used for defaulting the 'type' attribute, without checking
    that for None, causing an exception to be raised in this case.
    (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Added a check in the CIMProperty constructor that the 'name' argument is
    not None.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue that the CIMProperty constructor raised only TypeError
    even when the issue was not about types; it now raises in addition
    ValueError.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Changed the exception that is raised in NocaseDict.__setitem__() for
    invalid key types, to be TypeError in instead of KeyError. Updated the
    testcases accordingly.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added checks for more than one argument and for unsupported argument
    types to the constructor of NocaseDict.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed incorrectly labeled namespace variables in twisted client.
    (Robert Booth)

  * Fixed that WBEMConnection.last_raw_reply was not set to the current reply
    in case of parsing errors in the reply.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Reintroduced Python 2.6 support in cim_http.HTTPSConnection.connect()
    that disappeared in early drafts of this version:
    - Removed SSLTimeoutError from except list; being a subclass of SSLError,
      it is catched via SSLError.
    - Invoked socket.create_connection() without source_address, if running
      on Python 2.6.
    (Andreas Maier)

   * Fixed bug where HTTP body was attempted ot be read when CIMError header
     is set, causing a hang.  (Andreas Maier)

   * Added CIM-XML declaration support for alternative PyWBEM client based
     on twisted.  (Andreas Maier)
 
   * Added support for Windows to wbemcli.py, by making dependency on HOME
     environment variable optional, and adding HOMEPATH environment variable.
     Also, cleaned up the global namespace of wbemcli.py and made it
     importable as a module.  (Andreas Maier)

   * Fixed errors in generated MOF (e.g. in any tomof() methods):
     - Missing backslash escaping within string literals for \n, \r, \t, \".
     - Representation of REF types was incorrect.
     - '=' in array-typed qualifier declarations was missing.
     - Fixed size indicator was missing in array elements.
     - Qualifiers of method parameters were missing.
     Improvements in generated MOF:
     - Changed order of qualifiers to be sorted by qualifier name.
     - Added empty line before each property and method in the class for
       better readability.
     - Method parameters are now placed on separate lines.
     - Moved generation of method qualifiers from class into method. This
       changes the behavior of CIMMethod.tomof() to now generate the method
       qualifiers.
     (Andreas Maier)

  TESTING:

  * Added support for running the unit test cases without having to be in the
    testsuite directory. This was done by setting up the DTD_FILE path
    correctly for any XML tests.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the quality of assertion messages issued when testcases fail, to
    include context information and types.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added docstrings to test cases.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added testcases for CIMProperty.__init__() to be comprehensive.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * In XML validation tests, added the expected XML root element.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added a header to any error messages issued by xmllint.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: Merged stderr into stdout for the xmllint invocation, xmllint error
    messages go to stderr and had been dropped before.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: The "mkdir -p ..:" command in the comfychair testcase constructor
    created subdirectories named "-p" when running on Windows; replaced that
    command with os.makedirs().  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: Replaced the "rm -fr ..." command in the comfychair testcase
    constructor with shutil.rmtree(), in order to better run on Windows.
    (Andreas Maier)
  
  * Fix: In comfychair._enter_rundir(), moved registration of cleanup
    function _restore_directory() to the end, so cleanup happens only if no
    errors happened.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed a bug in pywbem/trunk/testsuite/test_tupleparse.py in function
    ParseCIMProperty.runtest(), where the use of real tab characters caused
    a few lines to be incorrectly indented, and as a result, ignored for the
    test.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved Windows portability in testsuite: Moved from using the Unix-only
    functions posix.WIFSIGNALED() and posix.WEXITSTATUS() for testing the
    success of subprocess.wait(), to simply testing for 0.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added ability to invoke test_cim_operations.py with comfychair arguments,
    and added printing of exception information if an operation fails.
    (Andreas Maier)

  - clean code:
    
  * Removed dangerous default parameter '{}' from CIMProperty and
    CIMInstanceName, and replaced it with 'None'. To support that, added
    support for initializing an empty NocaseDict object from 'None'.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * In cim_obj, changed the use of the deprecated backticks to using %r in
    the format string (which produces the same result).  (Andreas Maier)

  * In the constructor of CIMInstanceName, added assertions to some paths
    that cannot possibly be taken based on the fact that the keybindings
    attribute is always a NocaseDict. They should be removed at some point.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Addressed PyLint issues:
    - Consolidated imports at the top of the module (after module docstring),
      consistent with the PEP-8 recommendation.
    - Ensured order of imports: standard, non-standard, pywbem, local (on a
      subset of modules only).
    - Replaced wildcard imports with specific imports, as much as possible.
    - Removed unused imports.
    - Addressed PyLint issues that are related to whitespace, continuation
      indentation, and line length.
    - Replaced all real tab characters with spaces.
    (Andreas Maier)

  PACKAGING / BUILD:

  * Fixed grammatical funkiness in the license text.  No change to actual
    license - still LGPLv2.  (Tim Potter)

  * Added LICENSE.txt file to release.  (Tim Potter)

  * Added LICENSE.txt, NEWS, README and INSTALL files to distribution
    archive.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed inconsistencies in license text in file headers to consistently
    say LGPL 2.1 or higher (The LICENSE.txt file has always been LGPL 2.1).
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Removed confusing section about build from INSTALL file, to scope it just
    to the topic of installation.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Restructured pywbem/trunk subtree to move pywbem package files into a
    pywbem subdirectory.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added a makefile (invoke 'make help' for valid targets).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for checking the Python source code using PyLint.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for generating HTML documentation using epydoc, and
    included the documentation into the distribution archive. The syntax
    used in Python docstrings is reStructuredText markdown.   (Andreas Maier)

  LICENSING:
    * Relicensed from the GNU GPLv2 to the GNU LGPLv2.
  API CHANGES:
    * Add a type keyword arg and attribute to CIMQualifier, similar to
      the CIMProperty object, to allow the creation of null qualifiers.
      (Tim Potter) 
    * Remove the toxml() method from CIM object classes.  Use
      tocimxml().toxml() instead which specifies the CIM-XML
      representation of the object. (Tim Potter)
    * CIMDateTime class should now be used instead of datetime.datetime 
      and datetime.timedelta. 
    * Added a new method, CIMInstance.update_existing().  This behaves 
      like update() on a dict, but only assigns new values to existing
      properties.  It skips values for properties not already present
      in the instance.  This is useful for honoring PropertyList within
      python providers. 
  ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added support for generating Pegasus provider registration MOF in 
      cim_provider.codegen(). (Bart Whiteley)
	* Implemented methods to parse indication export requests.
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Python provider code generation enhancements.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for Pegasus Local authentication.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for Pegasus and OpenWBEM Unix Domain Socket.  (Tim and Bart)
    * Added support for Pegasus non-compliant EMBEDDEDOBJECT XML attribute. 
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Added CIMQualifierDeclaration.tomof().  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Added a powerful MOF compiler.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for OpenWBEM password-less local authentication. 
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for embedded objects is described in DSP0201-2.2.0
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * New CIMDateTime class to deal with CIM-isms of datetimes.
      Most notably, datetime deals with timezone info poorly.
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Add InvokeMethod() support in Twisted Python client. (Tim
      Potter)
