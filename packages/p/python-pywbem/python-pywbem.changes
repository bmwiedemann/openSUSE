- Update to 1.7.2:
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix issue where pywbemlistener that fails startup can cause thread
      exception.
  * Incompatible changes:
    + Dropped support for Python 3.5.
    + In order to make life easier for people that package pywbem into Linux
      distros, vendorized the nocasedict and nocaselist packages.
    + Update to support urllib3 dependent package version 2.0+ for Python
      version 3.7+.
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fixed a doc build issue with Sphinx 6.x and addressed some of the
      Sphinx warnings during doc build.
    + Test: Fixed issues resulting from removal of support for
      pytest.warns(None) in pytest version 8.
    + Fixed new Pylint issue for unused variable 'exp_result'.
    + Test: Fixed issue in test_recorder.py where format of OrderDict repl
      output changed with python 3.12
  * Enhancements:
    + Update handling of request exceptions in CIM_http.py to account for
      changes to the urllib3 exceptions API that occurred in urllib3 version
      2.0.0 and keep the capability to handle the urllib3 exceptions API
      prior to versiion 2.0.
    + Add end2end tests for operation timeout.

      parameter
    + Extend support to Python version 3.12.
    + Moved the version constraints for the 'idna' package into the pywbem
      installation dependencies since it is an indirect dependency.
    + Changed the format of the README and README_PYPI files from RST to
      Markdown.

Wed Oct 25 09:55:41 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.6.2
  ## Incompatible changes:
  * The 'pywbem.ValueMapping' class will now raise a
    'pywbem.ModelError' for any missing or extra items in the
    'Values' qualifier, compared to the 'ValueMap' qualifier.
    Previously, 'IndexError' was raised. (issue #2991)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fixed coveralls issues with KeyError and HTTP 422 Unprocessable
    Entity.
  * Circumvented the removal of Python 2.7 from the Github Actions
    plugin setup-python, by using the Docker container
    python:2.7.18-buster instead.
  * Fixed missing dependencies in minimum-constraints.txt.
  * Fixed safety issues as of 8/21.
  ## Enhancements:
  * The 'pywbem.ValueMapping' class now allows controlling what
    should happen when the 'Values' qualifier has missing or extra
    items compared to the 'ValueMap' qualifier, by means of a new
    'values_default' parameter of the respective factory methods.
    If 'values_default' is None (default), a 'pywbem.ModelError' is
    raised for missing or extra 'Values' items. If it specifies a
    string value, missing items in the 'Values' qualifier are
    filled up with that value, and extra items in the 'Values'
    qualifier are truncated. (issue #2991)
  ## Cleanup:
  * Replaced the safety_ignore_opts in Makefile that is used as the
    basis for ignoring safety issues with the use of a
    .safety_policy_file defined by the safety utility.
  * Add a number of new ignores for additions to the safety issues
    lise May 2003
-  pywbem 1.6.1
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fixed a doc build issue with Sphinx 6.x (issue #2983) and
    addressed some of the Sphinx warnings during doc build.
- pywbem 1.6.0
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix issue where we could get HTTP retries upon HTTP read
    timeouts from the server. Changed to not allow urllib3 to do
    retries on post operations (the CIM/XML operations all use post
    and duplicates of some operations (invoke, update) could cause
    data integrity issues). (see issue #2951)
  ## Enhancements:
  * Support for Python 3.11. (issue #2904)
  ## Cleanup:
  * Ignore new safety issues for wheel, safety, and py packages and
    update values in minimum-requirements.txt.
  * Modify Makefile so safety check does not cause fatal github
    test failure. (see issue #2970)
  * Update the version of the OpenPegasus server Docker image used
    in tests to the docker image
    kschopmeyer/openpegasus-server:0.1.2 which used OpenPegasus
    2.14.3 located in the github OpenPegasus repository. This image
    is much smaller (110 mb) but the same set of models and
    providers as the previous image.
  * Modifications and pylint ignore statements for new pylint test
    for dict form dict(a=1) which is slower than {'a':1} and other
    new tests in pylint 2.16.0
- pywbem 1.5.0
  ## Incompatible changes:
  * Exceeding the 'WBEMConnection' timeout now results in raising
    'pywbem.TimeoutError' in some cases where previously
    'pywbem.ConnectionError' was raised. (issue #2853)
  * Changed the file permissions of setup.py to no longer be
    executable, in order to encourage transition to use pip install
    instead of executing setup.py install, which was deprecated by
    setuptools.
  * The removal of internal symbols from the 'pywbem_mock' Python
    namespace may cause name errors in your code, if you were using
    them. (related to issue #2888)
  * The pywbem_mock default instance writer
    (pywbem_mock/_instancewriteprovider.py) added checks for
    creation/modification of instances to validate that the
    reference properties of associations define existing instances
    if the property values exist. Previously they validated only
    the correct value type. (see issue #2908, extension to
    bidirectional inter-namespace associations)
  ## Bug fixes:
  * Fix issue where the DeepInheritance parameter not passed to the
    mocker OpenEnumerateInstances method so the result is that the
    mocker always uses the default (DeepInheritance=True). (see
    issue #2839)
  * Test: Mitigated incorrect version of testfixtures package on
    Python 3.5 by pinning it to <6.4.0 on Python 3.5. (issue #2855)
  * Documented that the pywbem MOF compiler does not support the
    "EmbeddedObject" qualifier with a class definition. (issue
    #2340)
  * Docs: Changes in autodocsumm and Sphinx versions to pick up
    final fix for issue #2697.
  * Re-enabled pylint on Python 3.5 (issue #2674)
  * Increased pylint to >=2.10 on Python >=3.6 to pick up fixes in
    similarity checker and enabled similarity checker again on
    pylint >=2.10 (issues #2672, #2673)
  * Excluded setuptools 61.0.0 because it breaks installation via
    "setup.py install" (issue #2871)
  * Resolved new issues reported by Pylint 2.13 (issue #2870)
  * Fixed that the added setup.py commands (test, leaktest,
    installtest) were not displayed. They are now displayed at
    verbosity level 1 (using '-v').
  * Previously, the sending of CIM request messages was retried in
    case no response was received within the timeout. This could
    potentially have resulted in executing operations multipe
    times. That is an issue for non-idempotent operations such as
    instance creation/deletion or method invocation. Fixed that by
    retrying now only during connection setup, but not for the
    sending of CIM request messages. (issue #2853)
  * Changed the default timeout of 'WBEMConnection' from 'None' to
    30 seconds. This prevents waiting for operation completion
    forever, by default. (issue #2853)
  * Pinned "certifi" to <2020.6.20 on Python 2.7 because the
    install test using "setup.py install" started failing because
    it installed a version of certifi on Python 2.7 that properly
    declares that it requires Python >=3.6.
  * Added a note to the install section of the documentation that
    installation via setup.py install has been deprecated by
    setuptools.
  * Removed internal symbols from 'pywbem_mock' Python namespace,
    and added the 'config' submodule to the 'pywbem_mock' Python
    namespace. (related to issue #2888)
  * Fixed invalid references in the documentation. As part of that,
    added class 'MOFWBEMConnection' to the 'pywbem' namespace,
    moved class 'IterQueryInstancesReturn' from the scope of method
    'pywbem.IterQueryInstances' to the 'pywbem' namespace. (issue
    #2888).
  * Fixed the name of the cythonized distribution archive.
  * Fixed new formatting issues raised by flake8 5.0.
  * Fixed issue in pywbem_mock/_wbemconnection_mock.py
    add_namespaces where namespaces that are added with
    add_namespace() after an interop provider is defined do not
    show up in the list of namespaces. It now uses
    server.create_namespace() if the interop namespace and
    namespace provider exist. (see issue #2865)
  * Fixed a RecursionError exception raised by flake8 on Python 3.6
    and 3.7. (issue #2922)
  * Fixed issue in pywbem_mock instancewrite providers where
    Create/Modify of an instance with reference properties fails if
    host set in reference property (i.e. CIMInstanceName). Now
    issues a warning and ignores the host value since pywbem_mock
    does not handle cross-host associations. (see issue #2920)
  ## Enhancements:
  * Added support for the new 'CIM_WBEMServerNamespace' class used
    in the DMTF WBEM Server Profile. In addition, the
    WBEMServer.create_namespace() method now uses the same class
    name for the new namespace that is already used for existing
    namespaces. (issue #2845)
  * Docs: Clarified that the timeout parameter in 'WBEMConnection'
    is for completing a CIM operation to a server or a CIM
    indication delivery to a listener. (issue #2853)
  * Improved the handling of exceptions raised by the "requests"
    and "urllib3" packages in pywbem, so that more meaningful
    messages are used. Exceeding the 'WBEMConnection' timeout now
    results in raising 'pywbem.TimeoutError' in some cases where
    previously 'pywbem.ConnectionError' was raised. (issue #2853)
  * Extend pywbem_mock creation of instances of associations to
    provide for bidirectional inter-namespace associations.
    Previously cross-namespace associations created in pywbem_mock
    were only visible in the namespace in which they were created.
    (see issue #2908)
  ## Cleanup:
  * Removed support for Python 3.4. It had been deprecated since
    pywbem 1.0.0. (issue #2829)
  * Modified compiler and pywbem_mock to allow creating instances
    from abstract classes because SNIA ignored DMTF rule making
    this illegal and many MOF compilers also ignored it. Pywbem now
    issue a warning from the MOF compiler if an instance of an
    abstract class is compiled but complete the compile and another
    warning from pywbem_mock.CreateInstance if the instance is for
    an abstract class. (see issue #2825)
  * Fix issues in manual test run_cimoperations.py that resulted
    from changes in the pywbem APIs. Since this was manual test it
    was not regularly used. Changes included removing tests for
    extra parameters which now cause failure of api.
  * Clarify why the iterEnumerateInstances and
    IterEnumerateInstancePaths always return the host name in the
    response. (see issue #2841)
  * Changed build process for distribution archives to use the
    build package.
  * Document a limitation in the IterQueryInstances request method
    (it delivers instances for Open/Pull after the request to the
    server is complete). (see issue #1801)
  * Added security issues 50748, 50571, 50664, 50663, 50892, 50885,
    50886 to Makefile ignore list of new security issue August and
    September 2022.
  * Fixed issue with mock namespace provider that would acreate the
    same namespace twice under some conditions (i.e. same name
    property but different path on CreateInstance. (see issue
    #2918)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 10:37:07 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.4.1
  * Fix issue where the DeepInheritance parameter not passed to the
    mocker OpenEnumerateInstances method so the result is that the
    mocker always uses the default (DeepInheritance=True). (see
    issue #2839)
  * Modified compiler and pywbem_mock to allow creating instances
    from abstract classes because SNIA ignored DMTF rule making
    this illegal and many MOF compilers also ignored it.  Pywbem
    now issue a warning from the MOF compiler if an instance of an
    abstract class is compiled but complete the compile and another
    warning from pywbem_mock.CreateInstance if the instance is for
    an abstract class. (see issue #2825)
- Release 1.4.0
  * Aligned minimum versions of pip,setuptools,wheel with
    pywbemtools, nocasedict,nocaselist. This increased the minimum
    version of pip on Python 3.5 to fix an issue.
  * Improved verbosity of namespace creation and deletion: Added
    optional 'verbose' parameters to the create_namecpace() and
    delete_namespace() methods of WBEMServer, and to the
    add_namecpace() and remove_namespace() methods of
    FakedWBEMConnection (and subsequently to BaseProvider) in the
    mock support.
- Actually cythonize if --with cythonize is given
  * switched off by default, because the produced commands throw
    yacc parser errors in the pywbemtools tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 26 15:34:59 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.3.0
  **Incompatible changes:**
  * The `WBEMListener.start()` method may raise new exceptions
    `pywbem.ListenerPortError`, `pywbem.ListenerPromptError` and
    `pywbem.ListenerCertificateError`. The `OSError` and `IOError`
    exceptions raised in earlier versions may still be raised for
    other, less common cases. For details, see the corresponding
    item in the Enhancements section, below.
  * Changed 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' method to use the
    'SourceNamespaces' property (allows multiple namespaces) of the
    'CIM_IndicationFilter' class instead of the deprecated
    'SourceNamespace' property (allows only single namespace).
    This changed the name of the positional 'source_namespace'
    parameter to 'source_namespaces`. The new parameter allows both
    string and list of strings as values.

    This change brings the subscription manager in line with the
    incorporation of the 'SourceNamespaces' property made to this
    CIM class definition by DMTF CIM schema release 2.22.0.

    An optional 'source_namespace' keyword parameter has been added
    to the 'add_filter()'method to account for any case where a
    WBEM Server cannot handle the SourceNamespaces property. The
    primary incompatibility will be that the instance created for
    CIM_Indication filter now has a property named
    'SourceNamespaces' instead of 'SourceNamespace'. See further
    comments below and issue #2725.
  * Changed the 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' method to no
    longer allow specifying the 'filter_id' parameter for permanent
    filters. The documentation had already disallowed that case,
    but the code allowed it. (issue #2757)
  * Added code to fail compile or creation in pywbem_mock of
    instance of Abstract class. Before this the WBEM server might
    fail the attempt but the MOF compiler and pywbem_mock would
    build the instance (see issue # 2742).
  * The new simplified format of the automatically generated 'Name'
    property of owned indication filters causes existing filters
    with the old format to be ignored and a Python warning of type
    'pywbem.OldNameFilterWarning' will be issued. Such owned filter
    instances need to be either removed as owned filters with a
    prior version of pywbem, or as permanent filters with this
    version of pywbem. (issue #2765)
  * Removed the
    'pywbem.WBEMSubscriptionManager.add_listener_destinations()'
    method, because the new naming approach for listener
    destinations requires either a name or an ID and that does not
    work well with supporting multiple destinations in one method
    call. Use the new 'add_destination()' method instead. (issue
    #2766)
  * The new simplified format of the automatically generated 'Name'
    property of owned listener destinations causes existing
    destinations with the old format to be ignored and a Python
    warning of type 'pywbem.OldNameDestinationWarning' will be
    issued. Such owned destination instances need to be either
    removed as owned destinations with a prior version of pywbem,
    or as permanent destinations with this version of pywbem.
    (issue #2766)

  **Bug fixes:**
  * Fixes bug in compiler where log of ModifyClass request failure
    was not surrounded by verbose test (if p.parse.verbose:). See
    pywbemcli issue #395,
  * Fixes several issues in WBEMSubscriptionManager:
    - Fixed the discrepancy between documentation and code in
      add_filter() regarding 'filter_id', 'name' and ownership
      type: The only allowed combinations are now owned filters
      with 'filter_id' and permanent filters with 'name'. (issue
      #2757)
    - add_filter() and add_destinations() methods  can no longer
      modify existing instances on the WBEM server. They can only
      create new instances.
    - Modified the algorithm to determine owned filters and
      instances so they are are correctly recovered from the WBEM
      server when the WBEMSubscriptionManager is restarted (before
      this they could be returned as not-owned object).
    - Change to use WBEM server systemname as the value of the
      SystemName property.
    - Removed code that built instance path for new filter and
      destination instances since that was used only to try to
      determine if instance existed to make the create/modify
      decision.
    - Added the client host as a component of the Name property for
      owned filters and destinations. (issue #2701).
    - Fix issue where windows indication throughput is very slow.
      It is in the range of 1 indication every 2 seconds.  The
      issue is not pywbem but windows itself apparently because of
      hosts file and DNS configuration such that using localhost
      builds in a delay. This can be fixed by using an IP address
      127.0.0.1 for the indication listener or modifying the hosts
      table in windows. For this test we chose to just change the
      host name  See issue #528)
    - Fixes issue with SubscriptionManager class where
      add_destinations loses the input parameter owned if there are
      multiple urls in the listener_urls parameter (see issue
      #2715)
    - Fixes issue where add_subscription returned wrong instance if
      the instance already exists. (See issue #2719)
    - Fix issues in SubscriptionManager.add_destination to add
      optional parameter which populates the destination
      PersistenceType property. (See issue #2712)
    - Add capability to mock subscription providers to execute
      ModifyInstance (See issue #2722)
    - Fixed pywbem_mock and the MOF_compiler to test for creation
      or compile of an instance with a creation class that has the
      Abstract qualifier. This will fail since abstract classes
      cannot be instantiated. (see issue #2742)
    - Removed use of unittest.Mock in
      pywbem_mock.FakedWBEMConnection to use mock versions of
      _imethodcall and _methodcall and simply duck typed the
      methods. (see issue #2755)
    - Fixed issue in pywbem SubscriptionManager where duplicate
      add_destination() resulted in good return rather than
      CIMError.  The code where the Name property is different but
      the URL the same was modified to test for both URL and
      persistence type equality before returning the existing
      instance. (See issue $ 2782)
  * Fixes MOF compiler issue  where the compiler was allowing array
    properties to have corresponding instances instantiated with
    non-array values and vice-versa. This now causes a parse error.
    (See issue # 2786)
  * Docs: Fixed an error with the autodocsumm and Sphinx 4.0.0.
    (issue #2697)
  * Jupyter Notebook: Ignored safety issues 40380..40386 in order
    to continue supporting it with Python 2.7. (issue #2703)
  * Windows: Removed dependency on bash command in pip upgrade in
    Makefile. (issue #2713)
  * WBEM listener: Fixed the incorrect Content-Type header value
    'text/html' that was set in its export responses by changing
    that to 'text/xml'. (part of issue #2729)
  * WBEM listener: Removed the incorrect check for the
    Accept-Encoding header value when processing export requests to
    be consistent with DSP0200 which requires that WBEM listeners
    must support any value. (part of issue #2729)
  * Fixed installation with setup.py on ubuntu for Python 2.7, 3.4,
    3.5, by pinning yamlloader to <1.0.0. (issue #2745)
  * Mitigated Pylint issue 'deprecated-method' when using
    time.perf_counter() on Python versions 3.6 and 3.7. (issue
    #2768)
  * Mitigated new Pylint error 'not-an-iterable' when using
    'WBEMServer' properties that return lists and use deferred
    initialization. (issue #2770)
  * Security - Added 42218 42253 42254 42297 42298 42203 to safety
    ignore list. These were new safety issues 1 Nov 2021. The
    modules are all in development, and Jupyter notebook.
  * Fix incompatibility between Sphinx 1.8.5 (version for python <=
    3.5) and docutils 0.18.  (See issue # 2787).
  * Modified dev-requirements and rtd-requirements to require
    Sphinx >= 3.54.
  * Modify dev-requirements.txt to limit version of more-itertools
    to  < 8.10.1 for python < 3.6. See issue #2796
  * Fixed new issues raised by Pylint 2.12.1.
  * Fixed error when installing virtualenv in install test on
    Python 2.7.
  
  **Enhancements:**
  * Improved the running of indication listeners via
    `WBEMListener.start()`:
    - The method will now raise a new exception
      `pywbem.ListenerPortError` when the port is in use, instead
      of the previous `socket.error` on Python 2 and `OSError` on
      Python 3 that had confusing or unspecific error messages.
    - The method will now raise a new exception
      `pywbem.ListenerCertificateError` when using HTTPS and there
      is an issue with the server certificate file, private key
      file, or invalid password for the private key file, instead
      of the previous `ssl.SSLError` or `OSError` that had
      confusing or unspecific error messages.
    - The method will now raise a new exception
      `pywbem.ListenerPromptError` when using HTTPS and the prompt
      for the password of the private key file was interrupted or
      ended, instead of the previous `IOError` or `OSError` that
      had unspecific error messages.
    - If the private key file is protected with a password, the
      password prompt now states the path name of the private key
      file in the prompt message.
    - Add optional initialization parameter `url` to pywbem_mock
      FakedWBEMConnection class. This allows a different URL than
      the default http://FakedWBEMConnection:5988. With this, tests
      can be executed with multiple simultaneous mock environments
      pywbem. (See issue #2711)
  * Test: Added support for validating the structure of
    user-defined properties in the easy-server server and vault
    files. As part of that, increased the minimum version of the
    'pytest-easy-server' package to 0.8.0. (issue #2660)
  * Added providers to the pywbem_mock environment for the  3
    classes required to manage subscriptions in a WBEM server.
    (See issue #2704)
  * Finalized the support for SI units that was experimental so
    far, i.e. the 'pywbem.siunit()' and 'pywbem.siunit_obj()'
    functions. (issue #2653)
  * Modify 'SubscriptionManager.add_filter()' to use the
    CIM_IndicationFilter property 'SourceNamespaces' in place of
    the deprecated 'SourceNamespace'. (see issue #2725 and the
    **Incompatible changes:** section above)
  * Added support for the ExportIndication export operation by
    extending 'WBEMConnection' to be able of targeting a WBEM
    listener instead of a WBEM server, and by adding an
    'ExportIndication()' method to 'WBEMConnection'. The
    'default_namespace' and 'use_pull_operations' init parameters
    and properties are ignored when targeting a WBEM listener.
    (issue #2729)
  * Test: Improved diff display when assertion in test_recorder.py
    fails.
  * Added toleration support for WBEM servers that return a CIM
    status CIM_ERR_FAILED when pywbem issues a pull operation and
    the server does not support it. Note that DSP0200 requires the
    use of CIM status CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED in this case, but at
    least one WBEM server returns CIM_ERR_FAILED. (issue #2736)
  * Added a 'copy()' method to 'WBEMConnection',
    'FakedWBEMConnection', 'LogOperationRecorder', and
    'TestClientRecorder'. The 'copy()' method returns a copy of the
    object where user-specified attributes are copied and any
    additional internal state is reset. In case of
    'FakedWBEMConnection', the repository and registries of the
    original object are reused by the new object. (issue #2750)
  * The init methods of 'WBEMConnection' and 'LogOperationRecorder'
    now copy any mutable input arguments in order to ensure the new
    object is decoupled from the user-provided objects. (related to
    issue #2750)
  * Changed the WBEMConnection.timeout property to be settable.
    This allows adjusting the timeout after the connection has been
    created. (issue #2752)
  * Pylint: Removed pinning of Pylint to <2.7.0 because the
    performance issue can also be addressed by disabling the
    similarity checker, and addressed Pylint issues reported by
    Pylint 2.9. (issue #2672)
  * Simplified the format of the automatically generated 'Name'
    property of owned indication filters from: ``"pywbemfilter:"
    {ownership} ":" {client_host} ":" {submgr_id} ":" {filter_id}
    ":" {guid}`` to: ``"pywbemfilter:" {submgr_id} ":"
    {filter_id}``. The client host was removed in order to allow
    different client systems to be used. The ownership was removed
    because filters with an auto-generated Name are always owned.
    The GUID was removed to make the name predictable and the
    uniqueness it attempted to guarantee is now achieved by
    rejecting the creation of filters with the same name. Overall,
    this change makes the name much more suitable for use in CLI
    tools such as pywbemcli. (issue #2765)
  * Added a `ToleratedSchemaIssueWarning` class with its base class
    `Warning`. The new `ToleratedSchemaIssueWarning` is expected to
    be used where the MOF compiler or code detects issues in the
    CIM Schema that are either tolerated or corrected.
  * Added a 'pywbem.WBEMSubscriptionManager.add_destination()'
    method that makes the way the 'Name' property is created for
    listener destination intances consistent with how that is now
    done for indication filters: There is a new parameter 'name'
    that directly sets the 'Name' property for permanent
    destinations, and a new parameter 'destination_id' that is used
    for creating the 'Name' property for owned destinations. The
    format of the generated 'Name' property has been changed from:
    ``"pywbemdestination:" {ownership} ":" {client_host} ":"
    {submgr_id} ":" {guid}`` to: ``"pywbemdestination:" {submgr_id}
    ":" {destination_id}``. The client host was removed in order to
    allow different client systems to be used. The ownership was
    removed because destinations with an auto-generated Name are
    always owned. The GUID was removed to make the name predictable
    and the uniqueness it attempted to guarantee is now achieved by
    rejecting the creation of destinations with the same name.
    Overall, this change makes the name much more suitable for use
    in CLI tools such as pywbemcli. (issue #2766)
  * Fixed install error of PyYAML 6.0b1 on Python 2.7 during
    installtest, by pinning it to <6.0.
  * Fixed install error of wrapt 1.13.0 on Python 2.7 on Windows
    due to lack of MS Visual C++ 9.0 on GitHub Actions, by pinning
    it to <1.13.
  * Fixed install error of yanked jsonschema 4.0.0 on Python <3.7,
    by excluding it.
  * Enhanced test matrix on GitHub Actions to always include Python
    2.7 and Python 3.4 on Ubuntu, and Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 on
    macOS and Windows.
  * Support for Python 3.10: Added Python 3.10 in GitHub Actions
    tests, and in package metadata.

  **Cleanup:**
  * Extend tests for SubscriptionManager to utilize pytest and
    cover error cases.

Fri Oct 22 19:45:12 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 1.2.0
  * Unsupported CIM infrastructure versions returned in CIM-XML
    responses from WBEM servers are now raised as a new exception
    `pywbem.CIMVersionError`, and were previously raised as
    `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError`. Unsupported DTD versions and CIM-XML
    protocol versions returned in CIM-XML responses from WBEM
    servers are now raised as new exceptions
    `pywbem.DTDVersionError` and `pywbem.ProtocolVersionError`, and
    were previously ignored by pywbem. Since these new exceptions
    are derived from `pywbem.VersionError` which is derived from
    `pywbem.VersionError`, this change is only incompatible if such
    unsupported versions were specifically handled by users.
  * The `pywbem.WBEMServer.get_selected_profiles()` method now
    raises `pywbem.ModelError` instead of `KeyError` when required
    properties were found to be missing. This is an incompatible
    change for users that catch this exception. (related to issue
    #2580).
  * The operation recorder support added in pywbem 0.9 as an
    experimental feature was changed to become internal. As part of
    this, the "WBEM operation recording" section has been removed
    from the documentation, the operation recorder specific classes
    are no longer documented, and the operation recorder specific
    attributes and methods of the 'WBEMConnection' class have been
    declared to be internal and have been removed from the
    documentation. The logging support which uses the operation
    recorder remains publicly available. If you are using the
    operation recorder, please create an issue in the issue tracker
    describing how you use it.
  * MOF compiler: Fixed bug where MOF compiler did not correctly
    install a CIM schema in a non-default namespace because it
    tried to get the qualifiers from the default namespace. (see
    issue #2502)
  * Test: Changed dependency to 'typed-ast' to match the needs of
    'astroid' and to install it only on CPython. This allows
    re-enabling PyPy3 on Travis.
  * Test: Pinned psutil to <=5.6.3 on PyPy2+3 to avoid an
    installation error.
  * Test: Increased the minimum version of 'pyzmq' on Python 3.9 to
    19.0.0 to avoid an installation error.
  * Test: Circumvented unicode issue with
    lxml.etree.fromstring()/XML() on Python 3.9 by passing in
    binary strings.
  * Test: Adjusted _format()/_ascii2() testcases to PyPy3 behavior
    with binary vs unicode results.
  * Test: Suppressed pylint warning about 'tracemalloc' methods on
    PyPy.
  * Test: Disabled leaktest in travis also on PyPy3 (in addition to
    PyPy2).
  * Test: Disabled 'make resourcetest' in Travis on Pypy2+3, and
    suppressed Pylint issues about using 'tracemalloc' methods and
    disabled its unit tests.
  * Fixed the bug that pywbem allowed reference typed CIMQualifier
    and CIMQualifierDeclaration objects. DSP0004 disallows
    reference types on qualifiers and qualifier declarations. This
    fix now causes CIM-XML responses received from a WBEM server
    with reference typed qualifier values and qualifier
    declarations to raise `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError` from
    `WBEMConnection` operations.
  * Fixed a `DeprecationWarning` issued by urllib3 about using the
    `whitelist_methods` parameter of `Retry`.
  * Security: Increased minimum version of 'PyYAML' to 5.2 on
    Python 3.4 and to 5.3.1 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5 to address
    security issues reported by safety. The relevant functions of
    'PyYAML' are not used by pywbem, though.
  * Security: Increased minimum version of 'urllib3' to 1.24.2 on
    Python 3.4 and to 1.25.9 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5 to address
    security issues reported by safety. To support these versions
    of 'urllib3', increased minimum version of 'requests' to 2.20.1
    on Python 3.4 and to 2.22.0 on Python 2.7 and >=3.5.
  * Security: Increased minimum versions of several packages that
    are needed only for test or development of pywbem to address
    security issues reported by safety: requests-toolbelt to 0.8.0;
    lxml to 4.6.2 (except for Python 3.4); pylint to 2.5.2 and
    astroid to 2.4.0 on Python >=3.5; typed-ast to 1.3.2 on Python
    3.4; twine to 3.0.0 on Python >=3.6; pkginfo to 1.4.2; bleach
    to 3.1.2 on Python 3.4 and to 3.1.4 on Python 2.7 and Python
    >=3.5.
  * Fixed issue on GitHub Actions with macos by no longer running
    "brew update" in pywbem_os_setup.sh. (issue #2544)
  * Docs: Fixed incorrect attribute name 'provider_classnames' in
    method provider example. (issue #2564)
  * Mitigated the coveralls HTTP status 422 by pinning
    coveralls-python to <3.0.0.
  * Test: Add tests to test_mof_compiler to test for errors where
    the namespace name component of the namespace pragma is
    missing.
  * In `CIMNamespaceProvider.post_register_setup()`, fixed an
    `AttributeError` when accessing the 'Name' property of a CIM
    instance (related to issue #2580).
  * In the `MOFCompiler` class, fixed that if a MOF instance
    already exists, the ModifyInstance operation failed because the
    instance path was not specified. The fix is to construct the
    instance path from the key properties in instance specified in
    MOF. That fix has the limitation that it does not account for
    instance providers that add key properties or that ignore
    provided key properties (e.g. InstanceID). (issue #2586)
  * Corrected issue in pywbem_mock where DeleteQualifier() was not
    checking whether the qualifier was used in any classes in the
    namespace before being deleted. (see #2585)
  * Fixed an incorrect calculation of the min/max values for the
    server response time in the statistics support of pywbem (issue
    #2599)
  * Security - Add safety issue 40072 (lxml version 4.6,3) to
    safety ignore list. No change to pywbem since we apparently do
    not use the affected component (see issue #2645)
  * Test: Pinned decorator package to python <=5.0.0 on Python
    2+3.4 because decorator 5.0.0 does not support python < 3.5
    (see issue #2647)
  * Fix pywem_mock issue with Delete class not calling providers to
    handle the DeleteInstance (see issue #2643)
  * Test: Workaround for BadStatusLine issue in
    test_WBEMListener_send_indications test function. This is not a
    fix for the root cause of the issue. For details, see pywbem
    issue #2659.
  * Fixed installation of 'pywinpty' package on Python 2.7 by
    pinning it to <1.0. It failed because it does not declare its
    supported Python versions. (see issue #2680)
  * Fixed that the test workflow ignored errors that occurred
    during 'make install' and 'make develop', by splitting the
    multiple commands in these steps into separate steps.
  * Finalized the pywbem mock support. (issue #2651)
  * Logging: Added a value 'off' for the log destination in the
    ``pywbem.configure_logging()`` function that disables logging.
    (part of issue #86)
  * Improved exception handling during the parsing of CIM-XML
    responses received from a WBEM server. Exceptions that were
    raised as TypeError or ValueError during the creation of CIM
    objects that are part of the operation result, are now raised
    as pywbem.CIMXMLParseError. Note that this is not an
    incompatible change because users were already potentially
    getting pywbem.CIMXMLParseError exceptions in other cases. (see
    issue #2512)
  * Test: Added CIM-XML testcases in the area of instance paths.
    (see issue #2514)
  * Docs: Clarified that `pywbem.type_from_name()` returns
    `CIMInstanceName` for type name "reference", even though for
    use in CIM method parameters, `CIMClassName` is also valid.
  * Issued a new `pywbem.MissingKeybindingsWarning` warning if a
    `CIMInstanceName` object that does not have any keybindings
    gets converted to CIM-XML by calling its `tocimxml()` method,
    or gets converted to a WBEM URI by calling its `to_wbem_uri()`
    method, or gets parsed from CIM-XML via an INSTANCENAME element
    without keybindings. This is motivated by the fact that DSP0004
    does not allow instance paths without keys (section 8.2.5).
    (See issue #2514)
  * Reduced memory consumption of CIM objects and CIM types by
    defining their attributes to use Python slots. (see issue
    #2509)
  * Reduced memory consumption of CIM objects by using lazy
    initialization of dictionary-type attributes. This resulted in
    significant savings when the attribute is typically unused, for
    example in ``CIMInstance.qualifiers``. (see issue #2511)
  * Added Python 3.9 to the supported Python versions and added
    tests for it on Travis.
  * Added a check for the DTDVERSION attribute value in CIM-XML
    responses from WBEM servers to start with '2.'. A different
    version of the CIM-XML DTD standard DSP0203 was never
    published, so this is not expected to be an incompatible
    change.
  * Unsupported versions for CIM infrastructure, DTD or protocol
    version returned in CIM-XML responses from WBEM servers are now
    raised as new exceptions `pywbem.CIMVersionError`,
    `pywbem.DTDVersionError`, and `pywbem.ProtocolVersionError`,
    respectively. These new exceptions are derived from the
    existing exception `pywbem.VersionError`. Previously,
    unsupported CIM infrastructure versions were raised as
    `pywbem.CIMXMLParseError`, and unsupported DTD or protocol
    versions were ignored by pywbem.
  * Removed the pinning of Pylint to 2.5.2 on Python >=3.5.
    Disabled the following warnings that were newly reported by the
    latest version (2.6.0) of Pylint: 'signature-differs' because
    it does not recognize compatible signature changes;
    'raise-missing-from' and 'super-with-arguments' because these
    issues cannot reasonably be addressed as long as Python 2.7 is
    supported.
  * In the makefile, added an ignore list for issues reported by
    safety along with the reasons why each issue is ignored. This
    allowed enforcing that the safety command reports no issues.
  * Migrated from Travis and Appveyor to GitHub Actions. This
    required several changes in package dependencies for
    development.
  * Docs: Added examples to the `pywbem.siunit()` and
    `pywbem.siunit_obj()` functions.
  * Extend the MOF compiler so that the pywbem_mock can compile MOF
    containing the namespace pragma that defines a namespace other
    than the one defined in the compile_mof_string() or
    compile_mof_file() methods namespace parameter if the namespace
    exists. Extend documentation on use of the namespace parameter
    to reflect the behavior if the MOF contains a namespace pragma.
    Since the code gives precedence to tha pragma over the
    namespace specified in in the namespace parameter, the
    documentation reflects this. (see issue #2256 partial fix).
  * The `pywbem.siunit()` function supported the PUnit format as
    defined in DSP0004. It turned out that the CIM Schema used
    PUnit qualifiers with a slightly extended format where the
    numeric modifiers were the middle instead of just at the end.
    Extened the PUnit format supported by the `siunit()` function
    accordingly. (issue #2574)
  * Improved and fixed the messages in the compile log of class
    `MOFCompiler` and ensured that the target namespace of the
    compiled objects is included in the messages and added messages
    for changes to the target namespace caused by 'pragma
    namespace' directives.
  * The 'mof_compiler' script now displays the compiled objects and
    their target namespace when specifying verbose mode (-v
    option).
  * Improvements in `pywbem_mock.CIMNamespaceProvider` and
    `pywbem.WBEMServer` to more cleanly handle Interop namespaces
    (related to issue #2580).
  * Improvements in the log messages of the `MOFCompiler` class.
    (related to issue #2586)
  * Added a `close()` method to `pywbem.WBEMConnection` that closes
    the underlying session of the 'requests' package. This avoids
    the ResourceWarning 'unclosed socket' that the 'requests'
    package issued so far when the Python process terminates. Added
    the ability for `pywbem.WBEMConnection` to be used as a context
    manager, that closes the connection at the end. (see issue
    #2591)
  * Added a mechanism to suspend the statistics counting of server
    time if one or more operations do not return the server
    response time, in order to prevent incorrect interpretations of
    the counters when only a subset of the operations returned
    server response time. (issue #2603)
  * Added validation tests to pywbem_mock ModifyClass to limit
    classes that can be modified (no subclasses, and no instances
    exist, and correct superclass) (see issue #2447)
  * Docs: Used 'autodocsumm' Sphinx extension for generating
    attribute and method summary tables for classes in the
    documentation. Moved documentation of some base classes into a
    new 'Base Classes' section in the appendix.
  * Added a `conn_close()` method to the `pywbem.MOFCompiler` class
    that closes the underlying connection. Used that function in
    the 'mof_compiler' script to remove a ResourceWarning about
    unclosed sockets. (issue #2610)
  * Added 'make perftest' to run performance tests. At this point,
    the performance tests measure the sending of indications to the
    pywbem.WBEMListener.
  * Test: Added support for end2end testing of WBEM servers based
    on server and vault files of the 'easy-server' Python package.
    The server files can specify WBEM servers and their expected
    supported functions. WBEM servers can be somewhere in the
    network or can be containers on DockerHub which are
    automatically pulled and started. At this point, the
    OpenPegasus container on DockerHub is used and the end2end
    tests are run in the GitHub Actions test workflow on Ubuntu
    (Docker is not available in GHithub Actions on Windows or
    MacOS).
  * Test: Fixed all remaining ResourceWarnings during test. (issue
    #86)
  * Test: Cleaned up DeprecationWarning for the propagation of key
    property values introduced in pywbem 1.1.0. (see issue #2498)
  * Add index section to generated documentation.
  * Fixed new issues reported by pylint 2.7.0. At the same time,
    needed to temporarily pin pylint to <2.7.0 and astroid to
    <2.5.0 due to massive elongation of the run time of pylint in
    the pywbem project.
  * Added tests for pywbem_mock ModifyClass request operation to
    test the validation exceptions and correctness of modified
    class. (see issue #2210)
  * Cleaned up TODOs noted in pywbem and pywbem_mock to fix any
    that were actually bugs, etc. and either create issues or mark
    the others as FUTURE with more explanation.  (See issue #2491)
  * Enforced that the pywbem source code does not contain any TODOs
    (pylint fixme). Note that the pywbem test code may still
    contain TODOs.
  * Removed remove_duplicate_setuptools.py script since the project
    is no longer using Travis.
  * On Python 3.4, the urllib3 package is pinned to <1.25.8 because
    1.25.9 removed Python 3.4 support. As a consequence, `safety
    issue
    <https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db/blob/master/data/insecure_full.json>`_
    38834 cannot be addressed on Python 3.4.

- Update to 0.17.1:
  - Fixed version incompatibilities reported by pip for tox/pluggy,
    ipython/prompt-toolkit, and flake8/pyflakes. (See issue #2153)
  - Fixed the issue where formatting the timezone name of
    a pywbem.MinutesFromUTC object raised NotImplementedError,
    by adding a tzname() method. (see issue #2160)
  - Increased minimum version of ‘six’ from 0.10.0 to 0.12.0
    when on Python 3.8 (or higher). (See issue #2150).

- Update to 0.17.0:
  - Dev: Fixed installation of Jupyter Notebook on Python 3.4 by defining
    the appropriate minimum versions of the ipython package,
    per Python version. (See issue #2135)
  - Changed the HTTPS support of pywbem.WBEMListener from using
    the deprecated ssl.wrap_socket() function to using the
    ssl.SSLContext class that was introduced in Python 2.7.9.
    This causes more secure SSL settings to be used.
    (See issue #2002)
  - Renamed all sub-modules within the pywbem namespace so they are
    now private (i.e. with a leading underscore).
    This has been done for consistency with the upcoming 1.0.0
    version of pywbem (See issue #1925)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  2 16:59:28 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to 0.16.0:
  - Silenced the MOFCompiler class for verbose=False.
  - Fixed that the MOFCompiler could be created with handle=None to
    work against a local repository. It was documented that way,
    but failed with AttributeError
  - Fixed the error that the MOF compilation of a class could fail but
    the error was not surfaced. This only happened when the MOF compiler
    was invoked against a WBEM server, when the class already existed,
    and when the ModifyClass operation that was attempted in
    this case, failed.
  - Fixed that the CIM-XML payload in log entries was spread over
    multiple lines. The payload is now escaped as a single-line
    Python string.
  - Fixed handling of Unicode string in ca_certs parm of
    WBEMConnection on py2

Fri Dec  6 14:22:55 CET 2019 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.15.0:
  - This release deprecates the wbemcli command. Pywbem 1.0.0
    will remove the wbemcli command. The recommended replacement
    is the pywbemcli command from the pywbemtools package on
    Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/pywbemtools/
  - Further changes are presented on

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 21 07:45:18 UTC 2016 - kkaempf@suse.com

- dropped python-pywbem-doc package, see http://pywbem.github.io

- rename 'wbemcli' to 'pywbemcli' to prevent conflict with
  sblim-wbemcli.

- Update to 0.8.1
  See http://pywbem.github.io/pywbem/doc/0.8.1/changelog.html for
  the complete list of changes.

  Known issues:
  * Installing PyWBEM on Python 2.6 has a conflict with the 'pbr'
    package from PyPI, resulting in a TypeError: "dist must be a
    Distribution instance". This issue is specific to Python 2.6 and
    does not occur in any of the other supported Python versions
    (2.7, 3.4, 3.5). This issue can be mitigated by uninstalling
    the 'pbr' package, or if that is not possible, by migrating
    to Python 2.7. See issue #26 on GitHub.
  * MOF using names that are reserved keywords will fail to compile
    in the MOF compiler. For example, a CIM property named
    'indication'. See issue #62 on GitHub.
  * The Pulled Enumeration Operations introduced in DSP0200 1.3 are
    not supported in this release. See issue #9 on GitHub.
  * Note that some components of this PyWBEM Client package are still
    considered experimental:
    - The twisted client module twisted_client.py.
    - The Python provider modules cim_provider.py and cim_provider2.py.
    - The CIM indication listener in the irecv directory. See issue
      #66 on GitHub.

- Splitted documentation off as python-pywbem-doc

- Update to 0.8.0~dev (development pre-release)

  * Verify certificates against platform provided CA trust store in
    /etc/pki/tls/certs. Linux only.  (Peter Hatina)

  * Added '-d' option to MOF compiler that causes the compiler to perform a
    dry-run and just check the MOF file syntax. This allows to more easily
    detect included MOF files when used together with the '-v' option.
    (Jan Safranek)

  * Added support for non-ASCII (Unicode) characters.  (Michal Minar, Andreas
    Maier)
      
  * Improved information in the message text of some exceptions (TypeError
    and KeyError in cim_obj.py, ValueError in cim_obj.py, and ParseError in
    tupleparse.py).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Moved the definition of the pywbem version from setup.py to __init__.py,
    in order to make it available to programs using pywbem as
    pywbem.__version__.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for direct iteration over NocaseDict objects using 'for'
    and 'in' by adding __iter__(), e.g. for use with CIMInstance.properties.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added more instance attributes to be shown in repr() on CIMProperty and
    other classes in cim_obj.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added and improved docstring-based documentation in the pywbem modules
    cim_operations, cim_http, cim_obj, cim_types, and the pywbem module.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the way missing file:// URL support on Windows is handled, by
    now issuing a proper error message instead of stumbling across the
    missing socket.AF_UNIX constant.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the way missing OWLocal authorization with the OpenWBEM server
    is handled on Windows, by now issuing a proper error message instead of
    stumbling across the missing os.getuid() function.  (Andreas Maier)
      
  * Improved Windows portability by no longer attempting to import 'pwd' in
    case the userid is not set in the environment variables that are checked
    when the WBEM server is local.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for ExecQuery operation to twisted client.  (Robert Booth)

  * Added get() methods on CIMInstance and CIMInstanceName to step up to the
    statement that they behave like dictionaries w.r.t. properties and key
    bindings.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved help text of test_cim_operations.py test program.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added an optional Params argument to InvokeMethod(), that is an ordered
    list of CIM input parameters, that preserves its order in the CIM-XML
    request message. This is to accomodate deficient WBEM servers that do
    not tolerate arbitrary order of method input parameters as required by
    the standard. The new argument is optional, making this a backwards
    compatible change of InvokeMethod().  (Andreas Maier)

  * Cleaned up the public symbols of each module by making symbols private
    that are used only internally. Specifically, the following symbols have
    been made private: In cimxml_parse: _get_required_attribute,
    _get_attribute, _get_end_event, _is_start, _is_end. In cim_xml: _text
    (was: Text).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Cleaned up symbols imported by wildcard import by defining __all__ in
    each module with only the public symbols defined in that module (removing
    any symbols imported into the module), except for the following modules
    which define less than the complete set of public symbols in their
    __all__: mof_compiler, twisted_client, tupleparse, cimxml_parse,
    cim_http.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for using CDATA section based escaping in any requests sent
    to the WBEM server. The default is still XML entity reference based
    escaping, the CDATA based escaping can be turned on by setting the switch
    _CDATA_ESCAPING accordingly, which is a global variable in the cim_xml
    module.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Simplified the exceptions that can be raised by WBEMConnection methods,
    and improved the information in the exception messages. See description
    of WBEMConnection class for details.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for timeouts to WBEMConnection, via a new timeout argument,
   that defaults to no timeout.  (This finally increased the minimum version
   of Python to 2.6.  (Andreas Maier)

  BUG FIXES:

  * Fix syntax error in CIM DTDVERSION error path.  Allow KEYVALUE
    VALUETYPE attribute to be optional as specified in the DTD.
    (Andreas Linke)

  * Added parsing of InvokeMethod return value and output parameters for
    Twisted Python client.  (Tim Potter)

  * Fixed cim_provider2.py to properly support shutdown() and can_unload()
    (called from CMPI cleanup() functions).  Support was recently added
    to cmpi-bindings for this.  (Bart Whiteley)

  * Fixed XML parsing to accept SFCB-style embedded instance parameters.
    (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Use getpass module instead of pwd to detect local user to fix Win32.
    (Tim Potter)

  * Re-throw KeyError exceptions with capitalised key string instead
    of lower cased version in NocaseDict.__getitem__().  (Tim Potter)

  * Use base64.b64encode() instead of base64.encodestring() in Twisted
    client. (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Fix missing CIMDateTime import in Twisted client.  (Mihai Ibanescu)

  * Fixed CIMInstanceName rendering to string. It is now possible to pass the
    rendered string value as an instance path argument of a CIM method.
    (Jan Safranek, Michal Minar)

  * For Python providers, fixed the comparsion of the Role parameter in
    association operations to be case insensitive, and removed an erroneous
    test that raised an exception when the property specified in the Role
    parameter was not also in the property list specified by the Properties
    parameter.  (Jan Safranek)

  * For Python providers, converted debug 'print' statements to trace
    messages that end up in the system log.  (Jan Safranek)

  * The CIM-XML parser no longer throws an exception when parsing a
    qualifier declaration.
    Note: The CIM-XML supported by this fix does not conform to DSP0201 so
    far. Further fixes are pending.  (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed parsing errors for connection URLs with IPv6 addresses, including
    zone indexes (aka scope IDs).  (Peter Hatina, Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the hard coded socket addressing family used for HTTPS that was
    incorrect in some IPv6 cases, by determining it dynamically.
    (Peter Hatina)

  * Fixed the list of output parameters of extrinsic method calls to be
    returned as a case insensitive dictionary (using cim_obj.NocaseDict).
    (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed the checking of CIMVERSION attributes in CIM-XML to only verify the
    major version, consistent with DSP0201 (see subclause 5.2.1, in DSP0201
    version 2.3.1).  (Jan Safranek)

  * Fixed error in cim_http.py related to stronger type checking of Python
    2.7. (Eduardo de Barros Lima)

  * Removed erroneous qualifier scopes SCHEMA and QUALIFIER from the MOF
    compiler (see DSP0004).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed debug logging of CIM-XML payload (that is, conn.last_*request/reply
    attributes) for extrinsic method calls, to now be consistent with
    intrinsic method calls.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) error when validating peer's
    certificate.  (Michal Minar)

  * Added a check in the CIMInstanceName constructor that the 'classname'
    argument is not None.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a tuple
    for the 'value' argument was incorrectly detected to be a scalar (and not
    an array).  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a
    datetime or timedelta typed value resulted in storing the provided object
    in the 'value' attribute, instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime
    object.  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that specifying a datetime
    formatted string typed 'value' argument along with type='datetime'
    resulted in storing the provided string object in the 'value' attribute,
    instead of converting it to a CIMDateTime object.  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed several cases in the CIMProperty constructor of unnecessarily
    requiring the optional arguments 'type', 'is_array', 'embedded_object',
    or 'reference_class'. These optional arguments are now only necessary to
    be provided if they cannot be implied from provided arguments (mainly
    from 'value').  (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that an 'embedded_object'
    argument value of 'object' was changed to 'instance' when a CIMInstance
    typed 'value' argument was also provided.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue in the CIMProperty constructor that the first array
    element was used for defaulting the 'type' attribute, without checking
    that for None, causing an exception to be raised in this case.
    (Andreas Maier)
    
  * Added a check in the CIMProperty constructor that the 'name' argument is
    not None.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed the issue that the CIMProperty constructor raised only TypeError
    even when the issue was not about types; it now raises in addition
    ValueError.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Changed the exception that is raised in NocaseDict.__setitem__() for
    invalid key types, to be TypeError in instead of KeyError. Updated the
    testcases accordingly.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added checks for more than one argument and for unsupported argument
    types to the constructor of NocaseDict.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed incorrectly labeled namespace variables in twisted client.
    (Robert Booth)

  * Fixed that WBEMConnection.last_raw_reply was not set to the current reply
    in case of parsing errors in the reply.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Reintroduced Python 2.6 support in cim_http.HTTPSConnection.connect()
    that disappeared in early drafts of this version:
    - Removed SSLTimeoutError from except list; being a subclass of SSLError,
      it is catched via SSLError.
    - Invoked socket.create_connection() without source_address, if running
      on Python 2.6.
    (Andreas Maier)

   * Fixed bug where HTTP body was attempted ot be read when CIMError header
     is set, causing a hang.  (Andreas Maier)

   * Added CIM-XML declaration support for alternative PyWBEM client based
     on twisted.  (Andreas Maier)
 
   * Added support for Windows to wbemcli.py, by making dependency on HOME
     environment variable optional, and adding HOMEPATH environment variable.
     Also, cleaned up the global namespace of wbemcli.py and made it
     importable as a module.  (Andreas Maier)

   * Fixed errors in generated MOF (e.g. in any tomof() methods):
     - Missing backslash escaping within string literals for \n, \r, \t, \".
     - Representation of REF types was incorrect.
     - '=' in array-typed qualifier declarations was missing.
     - Fixed size indicator was missing in array elements.
     - Qualifiers of method parameters were missing.
     Improvements in generated MOF:
     - Changed order of qualifiers to be sorted by qualifier name.
     - Added empty line before each property and method in the class for
       better readability.
     - Method parameters are now placed on separate lines.
     - Moved generation of method qualifiers from class into method. This
       changes the behavior of CIMMethod.tomof() to now generate the method
       qualifiers.
     (Andreas Maier)

  TESTING:

  * Added support for running the unit test cases without having to be in the
    testsuite directory. This was done by setting up the DTD_FILE path
    correctly for any XML tests.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved the quality of assertion messages issued when testcases fail, to
    include context information and types.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added docstrings to test cases.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added testcases for CIMProperty.__init__() to be comprehensive.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * In XML validation tests, added the expected XML root element.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added a header to any error messages issued by xmllint.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: Merged stderr into stdout for the xmllint invocation, xmllint error
    messages go to stderr and had been dropped before.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: The "mkdir -p ..:" command in the comfychair testcase constructor
    created subdirectories named "-p" when running on Windows; replaced that
    command with os.makedirs().  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fix: Replaced the "rm -fr ..." command in the comfychair testcase
    constructor with shutil.rmtree(), in order to better run on Windows.
    (Andreas Maier)
  
  * Fix: In comfychair._enter_rundir(), moved registration of cleanup
    function _restore_directory() to the end, so cleanup happens only if no
    errors happened.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed a bug in pywbem/trunk/testsuite/test_tupleparse.py in function
    ParseCIMProperty.runtest(), where the use of real tab characters caused
    a few lines to be incorrectly indented, and as a result, ignored for the
    test.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Improved Windows portability in testsuite: Moved from using the Unix-only
    functions posix.WIFSIGNALED() and posix.WEXITSTATUS() for testing the
    success of subprocess.wait(), to simply testing for 0.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added ability to invoke test_cim_operations.py with comfychair arguments,
    and added printing of exception information if an operation fails.
    (Andreas Maier)

  - clean code:
    
  * Removed dangerous default parameter '{}' from CIMProperty and
    CIMInstanceName, and replaced it with 'None'. To support that, added
    support for initializing an empty NocaseDict object from 'None'.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * In cim_obj, changed the use of the deprecated backticks to using %r in
    the format string (which produces the same result).  (Andreas Maier)

  * In the constructor of CIMInstanceName, added assertions to some paths
    that cannot possibly be taken based on the fact that the keybindings
    attribute is always a NocaseDict. They should be removed at some point.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Addressed PyLint issues:
    - Consolidated imports at the top of the module (after module docstring),
      consistent with the PEP-8 recommendation.
    - Ensured order of imports: standard, non-standard, pywbem, local (on a
      subset of modules only).
    - Replaced wildcard imports with specific imports, as much as possible.
    - Removed unused imports.
    - Addressed PyLint issues that are related to whitespace, continuation
      indentation, and line length.
    - Replaced all real tab characters with spaces.
    (Andreas Maier)

  PACKAGING / BUILD:

  * Fixed grammatical funkiness in the license text.  No change to actual
    license - still LGPLv2.  (Tim Potter)

  * Added LICENSE.txt file to release.  (Tim Potter)

  * Added LICENSE.txt, NEWS, README and INSTALL files to distribution
    archive.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Fixed inconsistencies in license text in file headers to consistently
    say LGPL 2.1 or higher (The LICENSE.txt file has always been LGPL 2.1).
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Removed confusing section about build from INSTALL file, to scope it just
    to the topic of installation.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Restructured pywbem/trunk subtree to move pywbem package files into a
    pywbem subdirectory.  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added a makefile (invoke 'make help' for valid targets).  (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for checking the Python source code using PyLint.
    (Andreas Maier)

  * Added support for generating HTML documentation using epydoc, and
    included the documentation into the distribution archive. The syntax
    used in Python docstrings is reStructuredText markdown.   (Andreas Maier)

  LICENSING:
    * Relicensed from the GNU GPLv2 to the GNU LGPLv2.
  API CHANGES:
    * Add a type keyword arg and attribute to CIMQualifier, similar to
      the CIMProperty object, to allow the creation of null qualifiers.
      (Tim Potter) 
    * Remove the toxml() method from CIM object classes.  Use
      tocimxml().toxml() instead which specifies the CIM-XML
      representation of the object. (Tim Potter)
    * CIMDateTime class should now be used instead of datetime.datetime 
      and datetime.timedelta. 
    * Added a new method, CIMInstance.update_existing().  This behaves 
      like update() on a dict, but only assigns new values to existing
      properties.  It skips values for properties not already present
      in the instance.  This is useful for honoring PropertyList within
      python providers. 
  ENHANCEMENTS:
    * Added support for generating Pegasus provider registration MOF in 
      cim_provider.codegen(). (Bart Whiteley)
	* Implemented methods to parse indication export requests.
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Python provider code generation enhancements.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for Pegasus Local authentication.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for Pegasus and OpenWBEM Unix Domain Socket.  (Tim and Bart)
    * Added support for Pegasus non-compliant EMBEDDEDOBJECT XML attribute. 
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Added CIMQualifierDeclaration.tomof().  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Added a powerful MOF compiler.  (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for OpenWBEM password-less local authentication. 
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Support for embedded objects is described in DSP0201-2.2.0
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * New CIMDateTime class to deal with CIM-isms of datetimes.
      Most notably, datetime deals with timezone info poorly.
      (Bart Whiteley)
    * Add InvokeMethod() support in Twisted Python client. (Tim
      Potter)
