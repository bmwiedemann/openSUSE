  <title>Remove files and directories</title>
  <description>*File::Remove::remove* removes files and directories. It acts like
*/bin/rm*, for the most part. Although 'unlink' can be given a list of
files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that. It also
accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.

*File::Remove::trash* accepts the same arguments as *remove*, with the
addition of an optional, infrequently used &quot;other platforms&quot; hashref.</description>
