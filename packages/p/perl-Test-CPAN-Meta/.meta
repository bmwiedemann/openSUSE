  <title>Validation of the META.yml file in a CPAN distribution.</title>
  <description>This module was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package makers
and installers such as the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage, the Module::Build
manpage and the Module::Install manpage.

See the CPAN::Meta manpage for further details of the CPAN Meta
Specification.</description>
