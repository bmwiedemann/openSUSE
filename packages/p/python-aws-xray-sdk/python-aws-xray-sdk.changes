- Update to 2.2.0
  * feature: Added context managers on segment/subsegment capture. `PR97 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/97>`_.
  * feature: Added AWS SNS topic ARN to the default whitelist file. `PR93 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/93>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed an issue on `psycopg2` to support all keywords. `PR91 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/91>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed an issue on `endSegment` when there is context missing. `ISSUE98 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/issues/98>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed the package description rendered on PyPI. `PR101 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/101>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed an issue where `patch_all` could patch the same module multiple times. `ISSUE99 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/issues/99>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed the `datetime` to `epoch` conversion on Windows OS. `ISSUE103 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/issues/103>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed a wrong segment json key where it should be `sampling_rule_name` rather than `rule_name`.
- Update to 2.1.0
  * feature: Added support for `psycopg2`. `PR83 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/83>`_.
  * feature: Added support for `pynamodb` >= 3.3.1. `PR88 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/88>`_.
  * improvement: Improved stack trace recording when exception is thrown in decorators. `PR70 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/70>`_.
  * bugfix: Argument `sampling_req` in LocalSampler `should_trace` method now becomes optional. `PR89 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/89>`_.
  * bugfix: Fixed a wrong test setup and leftover poller threads in recorder unit test.
- Update to 2.0.1
  * bugfix: Fixed a issue where manually `begin_segment` might break when making sampling decisions. `PR82 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/82>`_.
- Update to 2.0.0
  * **Breaking**: The default sampler now launches background tasks to poll sampling rules from X-Ray backend. See the new default sampling strategy in more details here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-python-configuration.html#xray-sdk-python-configuration-sampling.
  * **Breaking**: The `should_trace` function in the sampler now takes a dictionary for sampling rule matching.
  * **Breaking**: The original sampling modules for local defined rules are moved from `models.sampling` to `models.sampling.local`.
  * **Breaking**: The default behavior of `patch_all` changed to selectively patches libraries to avoid double patching. You can use `patch_all(double_patch=True)` to force it to patch ALL supported libraries. See more details on `ISSUE63 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/issues/63>`_
  * **Breaking**: The latest `botocore` that has new X-Ray service API `GetSamplingRules` and `GetSamplingTargets` are required.
  * **Breaking**: Version 2.x doesn't support pynamodb and aiobotocore as it requires botocore >= 1.11.3 which isn’t currently supported by the pynamodb and aiobotocore libraries. Please continue to use version 1.x if you’re using pynamodb or aiobotocore until those haven been updated to use botocore > = 1.11.3. 
  * feature: Environment variable `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS` now takes an additional notation in `tcp:127.0.0.1:2000 udp:127.0.0.2:2001` to set TCP and UDP destination separately. By default it assumes a X-Ray daemon listening to both UDP and TCP traffic on `127.0.0.1:2000`.
  * feature: Added MongoDB python client support. `PR65 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/65>`_.
  * bugfix: Support binding connection in sqlalchemy as well as engine. `PR78 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/78>`_. 
  * bugfix: Flask middleware safe request teardown. `ISSUE75 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/issues/75>`_. 
- Update to 1.1.2
  * bugfix: Fixed an issue on PynamoDB patcher where the capture didn't handle client timeout.
- Update to 1.1.1
  * bugfix: Handle Aiohttp Exceptions as valid responses `PR59 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/59>`_.
- Update to 1.1
  * feature: Added Sqlalchemy parameterized query capture. `PR34 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/34>`_
  * bugfix: Allow standalone sqlalchemy integrations without flask_sqlalchemy. `PR53 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/53>`_
  * bugfix: Give up aiohttp client tracing when there is no open segment and LOG_ERROR is configured. `PR58 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/58>`_
  * bugfix: Handle missing subsegment when rendering a Django template. `PR54 <https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python/pull/54>`_
  * Typo fixes on comments and docs.
