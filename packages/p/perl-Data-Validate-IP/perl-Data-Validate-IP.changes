  - Fixed handling of the ::0/128 subnet. This is a special subnet(/address)
    that is called the "unspecified address". It is not public or
    routable. Reported by Dan Sherry. GH #13.

  - Added some more details to the security docs to include mentions of the
    is_*_ip() functions too.

  - Fixed a typo in the POD.
  0.28  2021-03-29
  - Added docs about the security implications of using functions like
    is_private_ip4() without _also_ calling is_ipv4() first. This was inspired
    by a recent issue with the Node netmask package. See
    https://sick.codes/universal-netmask-npm-package-used-by-270000-projects-vulnerable-to-octal-input-data-server-side-request-forgery-remote-file-inclusion-local-file-inclusion-and-more-cve-2021-28918/
    for a write up.

  - If your version of Socket.pm provides a sane inet_pton, most of the is_*_ip
    subroutines will use a much faster implementation. is_private_ipv4 and
    is_private_ipv4 are approximately 16x faster. is_private_ipv6 and
    is_public_ipv6 are about 3-4x faster.  Implemented by Greg Oschwald. GitHub
    PR #8.

  - Fixed issue where invalid IPv6 strings such as ::0000000 would be marked as
    valid by is_ipv6() when using the faster inet_pton() code path (GitHub
    #6). Fixed by Greg Oschwald. GitHub PR #7.

- Update to 0.24
  * A string with a null byte (\0) would be considered valid if the internal
    implementation used inet_pton() to validate IP addresses. Fixed by Greg
    Oschwald. GitHub PR #4. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 06:04:07 UTC 2014 - mlin@suse.com

- Update to 0.23. Changes from 0.20:
  * Fixed is_ipv6 to correctly fail for a string like ":abcd" on platforms
    where inet_pton() isn't usable. Reported by Brian Bickerton. RT #93622.
  * As a side effect of the above, the code to check IPv6 addresses when
    inet_pton() isn't usable is about 7-8x times faster now.
  * Fixed some small doc typo/formatting issues.
  * The 198.51.100.0/24 and 203.0.113.0/24 networks were mistakenly put in
    the unroutable list, rather than the testnet list. This has been
    fixed. Note that if you've just been using is_public_ipv4 in your code,
    there are no changes in the results.
  * Added the 6to4 anycast network - 192.88.99.0/24. Addresses in this
    network are not considered public and there is now a new
    is_anycast_ipv4() subroutine exported.
  * Added a number of missing reserved IPv6 networks. These are the
    IPv4-mapped block (::ffff:0:0/96), the discard prefix (100::/64), TEREDO
    (2001::/32), ORCHID (2001:10::/28), and documentation (2001:db8::/32)
    IPv6 networks. There are now is_ipv4_mapped_ipv6(), is_discard_ipv6(),
    is_teredo_ipv6(), is_orchid_ipv6(), and is_documentation_ipv6()
    subs. Note that the TEREDO and ORCHID networks are both subnets of the
    larger special network, and as such were already excluded by
    is_public_ipv6(), though arguably the TEREDO addresses _should_ be
    considered public.
  * Rewrote most of the docs to greatly reduce the amount of text and to
    improve the ToC on MetaCPAN and search.cpan.org.
