%description
This app smooths over a lot of things when dealing with pyScss in Django. It

- Overwrites the import system to use Django's staticfiles app. This way, one
  can import SCSS files from any app (or any file that's findable by the
  STATICFILES_FINDERS).

- Configures pyScss to work with the staticfiles app for its image functions
  (e.g. inline-image and sprite-map).

- It provides a django-compressor precompile filter class so that the developer
  can use pyScss with django-compressor without having to bust out to the
  shell.  This has the added benefit of removing the need to configure pyScss
  through its command-line arguments, AND makes it possible for the exceptions
  and warnings that pyScss emits to bubble up to the process so that the user
  actually knows what's going on.
