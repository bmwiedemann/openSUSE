Fri Jan  3 08:52:46 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 7.0.0:
  * Breaking changes
    This release removes kyverno support. All references to command
    line options and action options related to kyverno have been
    removed and you need to remove them when upgrading. It is
    expected this feature was rarely used (and as a result, not
    worth the effort to maintain).
  * What's Changed
    There is a change to dependency tracking for HelmReleases that
    is meant to catch changes in dependencies that were previously
    ignored. Please report an issue if you see unexpected
    HelmRelease diffs.
    - Remove kyverno support by @allenporter in #818
    - Move resource diff and visitor logic to primary library
      directory by @allenporter in #819
    - Update testdata to remove invalid dependsOn reference in
      cluster8 by @allenporter in #820
    - Improve HelmRelease dependency tracking for diffs by
      @allenporter in #821

Fri Oct 11 09:32:07 UTC 2024 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- update to 6.0.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - This is a breaking change that updates the format of the flux
      build command to have parity with get and diff commands.
      Example to build a single kustomziation:
        $ flux-local build ks apps --path tests/testdata/cluster/
      Example to inflate a single helm release:
        $ flux-local build hr podinfo -n podinfo --path tests/testdata/cluster
      The old behavior flux-local build tests/testdata/cluster/ can
      still be achieved with build all:
        $ flux-local build all tests/testdata/cluster/
