- update to 6.0.0:
  * Breaking Changes
    - This is a breaking change that updates the format of the flux
      build command to have parity with get and diff commands.
      Example to build a single kustomziation:
        $ flux-local build ks apps --path tests/testdata/cluster/
      Example to inflate a single helm release:
        $ flux-local build hr podinfo -n podinfo --path tests/testdata/cluster
      The old behavior flux-local build tests/testdata/cluster/ can
      still be achieved with build all:
        $ flux-local build all tests/testdata/cluster/
