  <title>Fork of Python 3 pickle module</title>
  <description>This package presents a uniform pickling interface for ZODB:
 * Under Python2, this package forks both Python 2.7’s pickle and
   cPickle modules, adding support for the protocol 3 opcodes.
   It also provides a new subclass of bytes, zodbpickle.binary,
   which Python2 applications can use to pickle binary values such
   that they will be unpickled as bytes under Py3k.
 * Under Py3k, this package forks the pickle module (and the
   supporting C extension) from both Python 3.2 and Python 3.3.
   The fork add support for the noload operations used by ZODB.
