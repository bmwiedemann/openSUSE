  <title>DBI of event loop programming</title>
  <description>the AnyEvent manpage provides a uniform interface to various event loops.
This allows module authors to use event loop functionality without forcing
module users to use a specific event loop implementation (since more than
one event loop cannot coexist peacefully).

The interface itself is vaguely similar, but not identical to the the Event
manpage module.</description>
