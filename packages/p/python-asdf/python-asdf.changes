- Update to 2.6.0
  * AsdfDeprecationWarning now subclasses DeprecationWarning. [#710]
  * Resolve external references in custom schemas, and deprecate
    asdf.schema.load_custom_schema.  [#738]

    unrecognized. [#771]
  * Fix generic_io ``read_blocks()`` reading past the requested size [#773]

    reference cycles.  Eliminate need to call ``yamlutil.custom_tree_to_tagged_tree``
    and ``yamlutil.tagged_tree_to_custom_tree`` from extension code,
    and allow ``ExtensionType`` subclasses to return generators. [#777]
  * Fix bug preventing history entries when a file was previously
    saved without them. [#779]

    to handle internal references and reference cycles. [#781]
