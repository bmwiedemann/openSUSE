    @braingram in #1884
- Release 4.0.0

    deprecated features and changes to some defaults.
  ## Feature
  * Switch default ASDF standard to 1.6.0. (#1744)
  * Raise RuntimeError if a Convert subclass supports multiple tags
    but doesn't implement select_tag. (#1853)
  # General

    AsdfFile.__init__. (#1801)
  ## Removal
  * remove copy_arrays (replaced by memmap) (#1800)

  * added issue links to changelog entries
  * Change asdf standard changelog entries to notes to ease
    transition to towncrier

    values removes the mask [#1803]
  * Use a custom exception AsdfSerializationError to indicate when
    an object in the tree fails to be serialized by asdf (and by
    yaml). This exception currently inherits from
    yaml.representer.RepresenterError to provide backwards
    compatibility. However this inheritance may be dropped in a
    future asdf version. Please migrate to the new
    AsdfSerializationError. [#1809]
  * Drop importlib_metadata as a dependency on Python 3.12 and
    newer [#1810]

    extension/manifest package does not match that used to write
    the file [#1758]
  * Fix bug where a dictionary containing a key id caused any
    contained references to fail to resolve [#1716]
  * Issue a AsdfManifestURIMismatchWarning during write if a used
    extension was created from a manifest registered with a uri
    that does not match the id in the manifest [#1785]
  * Allow converters to provide types as strings that can resolve
    to public classes (even if the class is implemented in a
    private module). [#1654]
  * Add options to control saving the base array when saving array
    views controlled via AsdfConfig.default_array_save_base,
    AsdfFile.set_array_save_base and
    SerializationContext.set_array_save_base [#1753]
  * Deprecate ignore_implicit_conversion and "implicit conversion"
    [#1724]
  * Add lazy_tree option to asdf.open and asdf.config to allow lazy
    deserialization of ASDF tagged tree nodes to custom objects.
    [#1733]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 19 20:12:15 UTC 2024 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

  * Cleanup asdf.util including deprecating: human_list
    resolve_name minversion and iter_subclasses [#1688]
  * Deprecate validation on AsdfFile.tree assignment. Please use
    AsdfFile.validate to validate the tree [#1691]

    use AsdfFile.validate to validate the tree [#1691]
  * Deprecate asdf.asdf and AsdfFile.resolve_and_inline [#1690]
  * Deprecate automatic calling of AsdfFile.find_references during
    AsdfFile.__init__ and asdf.open [#1708]
  * Allow views of memmapped arrays to keep the backing mmap open
    to avoid segfaults [#1668]
  * Introduce memmap argument to asdf.open that overrides
    copy_arrays with documentation that describes that the default
    for memmap when copy_arrays is removed in an upcoming asdf
    release will be False and asdf will no longer by-default memory
    map arrays. [#1667]
  * Introduce asdf.util.load_yaml to load just the YAML contents of
    an ASDF file (with the option tagged to load the contents as a
    tree of asdf.tagged.Tagged instances to preserve tags) [#1700]
  * Require pytest 7+ and update asdf pytest plugin to be
    compatible with the current development version of pytest (8.1)
    [#1731]
  * Eliminate the use of the legacy tmpdir fixture in favor of the
    new tmp_path fixture for temporary directory creation. [#1759]
  * Remove conversion of warnings to errors in asdf pytest plugin.
    This prevented other warning filters (like those provided with
    -W) from working. If you want these warnings to produce errors
    you can now add your own warning filter [#1757]
  * Only show str representation during info and search if it
    contains a single line (and does not fail) [#1748]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  2 10:04:59 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.15.2:
  * The ASDF Standard is at v1.6.0
  * Add support for python 3.12 [#1641]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 11 03:06:11 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.15.1
  * the ASDF Standard is at v1.6.0
  * Drop Python 3.8 support [#1556]
  * Drop NumPy 1.20, 1.21 support [#1568]
  * Convert numpy scalars to python types during yaml encoding to
    handle NEP51 changes for numpy 2.0 [#1605]
  * Vendorize jsonschema 4.17.3 [#1591]
  * jsonschema vendorization
    - Asdf 2.15.1 includes internally a version of jsonschema
      4.17.3. This inclusion was done to deal with incompatible
      changes in jsonschema 4.18.
    - Many libraries that use asdf import jsonschema to allow
      catching of ValidationError instances that might be raised
      during schema validation. Prior to asdf 2.15 this error type
      was not part of the public asdf API. For 2.15 and later users
      are expected to import ValidationError from asdf.exceptions
      (instead of jsonschema directly).
    - To further ease the transition, asdf will, when possible, use
      exceptions imported from any installed version of jsonschema.
      This means that when the asdf internal jsonschema raises a
      ValidationError on a system where jsonschema was separately
      installed, the internal jsonschema will attempt to use
      ValidationError from the installed version. This should allow
      code that catches exceptions imported from jsonschema to
      continue to work with no changes. However, asdf cannot
      guarantee compatibility with future installed jsonschema
      versions and users are encouraged to update their code to
      import ValidationError from asdf.exceptions.
    - Finally, asdf is temporarily keeping jsonschema as a
      dependency as many libraries expected this to be installed by
      asdf. We expect to drop this requirement soon (likely in
      3.0.0) and this change might occur in a minor or even patch
      version.
