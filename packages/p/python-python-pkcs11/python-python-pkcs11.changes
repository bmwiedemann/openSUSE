- update to 0.9.3:
  * When determining the capabilities on an object, fall back to
    fetching flags one by one if fetching them all at once
    doesn't work. This mitigates issues with some tokens that
    don't handle errors on multi-attribute fetches in a compliant
    way.
- update to 0.9.1:
  * Add Python 3.14 to the CI matrix and release workflows.
  * Expand ATTRIBUTE_TYPES for GOSTR support.
  * Expose CK_SESSION_HANDLE as readonly
