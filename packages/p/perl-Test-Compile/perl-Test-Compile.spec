%description
'Test::Compile' lets you check the whether your perl modules and scripts
compile properly, results are reported in standard 'Test::Simple' fashion.

The basic usage - as shown above, will locate your perl files and test that
they all compile.

Module authors can (and probably should) include the following in a
_t/00-compile.t_ file and have 'Test::Compile' automatically find and check
all Perl files in a module distribution:

    #!perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::Compile qw();

    my $test = Test::Compile->new();
    $test->all_files_ok();
    $test->done_testing();
