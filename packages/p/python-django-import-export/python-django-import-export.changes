    (#1500) 3.0.0 (2022-10-18) Breaking changes This release
    makes some minor changes to the public API.  If you have
    overridden any methods from the resources or widgets modules,
    you may need to update your implementation to accommodate
    these changes. - Check value of ManyToManyField in skip_row()
  * This fixes an issue where ManyToMany fields are not checked
    correctly in skip_row().  This means that skip_row() now
    takes row as a mandatory arg.  If you have overridden
    skip_row() in your own implementation, you will need to add
    row as an arg.
  *  Bug fix: validation errors were being ignored when
    skip_unchanged is set (#1378)  If you have overridden
    skip_row() you can choose whether or not to skip rows if
    validation errors are present.  The default behavior is to
    not to skip rows if there are validation errors during
    import.
  * If you have overridden skip_row() you can choose whether or
    not to skip rows if validation errors are present.  The
    default behavior is to not to skip rows if there are
    validation errors during import.
  *  Use 'create' flag instead of instance.pk (#1362)
    import_export.resources.save_instance() now takes an
    additional mandatory argument: is_create.  If you have
    overridden save_instance() in your own code, you will need to
    add this new argument.
  * import_export.resources.save_instance() now takes an
    additional mandatory argument: is_create.  If you have
    overridden save_instance() in your own code, you will need to
    add this new argument.
  *  widgets: Unused *args params have been removed from method
    definitions. (#1413)  If you have overridden clean() then you
    should update your method definition to reflect this change.
    widgets.ForeignKeyWidget / widgets.ManyToManyWidget: The
    unused *args param has been removed from __init__().  If you
    have overridden ForeignKeyWidget or ManyToManyWidget you may
    need to update your implementation to reflect this change.
  * If you have overridden clean() then you should update your
    method definition to reflect this change.
  * widgets.ForeignKeyWidget / widgets.ManyToManyWidget: The
    unused *args param has been removed from __init__().  If you
    have overridden ForeignKeyWidget or ManyToManyWidget you may
    need to update your implementation to reflect this change.
  *  Admin interface: Modified handling of import errors (#1306)
    Exceptions raised during the import process are now presented
    as form errors, instead of being wrapped in a <H1> tag in the
    response.  If you have any custom logic which uses the error
    written directly into the response, then this may need to be
    changed.
  * Exceptions raised during the import process are now presented
    as form errors, instead of being wrapped in a <H1> tag in the
    response.  If you have any custom logic which uses the error
    written directly into the response, then this may need to be
    changed.
  *  ImportForm: improve compatibility with previous signature
    (#1434)  Previous ImportForm implementation was based on
    Django's forms.Form, if you have any custom ImportForm you
    now need to inherit from
    import_export.forms.ImportExportFormBase.
  * Previous ImportForm implementation was based on Django's
    forms.Form, if you have any custom ImportForm you now need to
    inherit from import_export.forms.ImportExportFormBase.
  *  Allow custom change_list_template in admin views using
    mixins (#1483)  If you are using admin mixins from this
    library in conjunction with code that overrides
    change_list_template (typically admin mixins from other
    libraries such as django-admin-sortable2 or reversion),
    object tools in the admin change list views may render
    differently now. If you have created a custom template which
    extends any import_export template, then this may now cause a
    recursion error (see #1514)
  * If you are using admin mixins from this library in
    conjunction with code that overrides change_list_template
    (typically admin mixins from other libraries such as django-
    admin-sortable2 or reversion), object tools in the admin
    change list views may render differently now.
  * If you have created a custom template which extends any
    import_export template, then this may now cause a recursion
    error (see #1514)
  *  import.html: Added blocks to import template (#1488)  If you
    have made customizations to the import template then you may
    need to refactor these after the addition of block
    declarations.
  * If you have made customizations to the import template then
    you may need to refactor these after the addition of block
    declarations.
  * Deprecations This release adds some deprecations which will
    be removed in a future release. - Add support for multiple
    resources in ModelAdmin.
  * The *Mixin.resource_class accepting single resource has been
    deprecated and the new *Mixin.resource_classes accepting
    subscriptable type (list, tuple, ...) has been added.
  * Same applies to all of the get_resource_class,
    get_import_resource_class and get_export_resource_class
    methods.
  * Deprecated exceptions.py
