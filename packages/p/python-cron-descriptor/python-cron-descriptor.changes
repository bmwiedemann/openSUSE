- update to 1.4:
  * support Vietnamese
  * Possible BC - Parsing call was moved from
    `ExpressionDescriptor.get_description` to
    `ExpressionDescriptor.__init__`  that means parsing
    exceptions are thrown when calling `ExpressionDescriptor`
    constructor and not when calling
    `ExpressionDescriptor.get_description`  modify your exception
    handling accordingly...
  * Possible BC - Option `throw_exception_on_parse_error`
    (boolean) was removed, code now works as if
    `throw_exception_on_parse_error=True` (default - always throw
    exceptions). Remove `throw_exception_on_parse_error` option
    from your code if you were using it.
