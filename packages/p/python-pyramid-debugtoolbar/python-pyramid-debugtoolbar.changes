- Rename to python-pyramid-debugtoolbar and integrated doc subpackage
- Trimmed package description
- Update to v4.5
  * Drop Python 3.3 support to align with Pyramid and its EOL
  * Add support for testing on Python 3.7
  * Add a list of engines to the SQLAlchemy panel if queries come from
    multiple engines
  * When the toolbar intercepts an exception via
    ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc = True`` and returns the interactive
    debugger, it will add ``request.exception`` and ``request.exc_info`` to
    the request to indicate what exception triggered the response. This helps
    upstream tweens such as ``pyramid_retry`` to possibly retry the requests
  * Stop parsing the ``request.remote_addr`` value when it contains chain of
    comma-separated ip-addresses. Reject these values and emit a warning
    to sanitize the value upstream

Sat Sep 10 14:07:41 UTC 2016 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 3.0.4:
  * 3.0.3 was a brownbag release missing static assets.

- changes from version 3.0.3:
  * Fix another regression where the toolbar was modifying requests to
    the toolbar itself such that the "script_name" and "path_info"
    were different after handling the request than before.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/269

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  4 01:24:50 UTC 2016 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 3.0.2:
  * Fix a regression with inspecting requests with a session that is
    loaded before the toolbar executes.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/268

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 13 15:13:00 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Split documentation into subpackage to speed up build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 28 03:14:19 UTC 2016 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * update copyright year

- update to version 3.0.1:
  * Avoid touching "request.unauthenticated_userid",
    "request.authenticated_userid" and "request.effective_principals"
    unless they are accessed by the user in the normal request
    lifecycle. This avoids some issues where unauthenticated requests
    could trigger side effects on your authentication policy or access
    the properties outside of the expected lifecycle of the
    properties.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/263

- changes from version 3.0:
  * The toolbar is now a completely standalone application running
    inside the tween. There are several minor incompatibilities and
    improvements related to this extra isolation:
    + 1. "pyramid_mako" and the ".dbtmako" renderer are no longer
      included in the parent application (your app).
    + 2. Panels must be extra careful now that they only render
      templates inside of the "render_vars" and "render_content"
      functions. These are the only functions in which the "request"
      object is for rendering the toolbar panel.
    + 3. The toolbar will not be affected by any global security
      policies your application may put in place other than via
      "config.set_debugtoolbar_request_authorization".  **never run
      the toolbar in production**
    See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/253
  * Updated Bootstrap to v3.3.6, refactored static assets and dropped
    require.js.  Each page now depends on what it needs without extra
    dependencies included in the debugger pages.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/259
  * Enabled interactive tablesorting on table columns.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/256
  * setuptools-git is now required to install the codebase in
    non-editable mode.

- changes from version 2.5:
  * Drop Python 2.6 and Python 3.2 support.
  * Add Python 3.5 support.
  * Remove inline javascript from injected pages to work better with
    any Content Security Policy that may be in place.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/250
  * Added the packages' `.location` to the "Versions" panel so
    developers can tell which version of each package is actually
    being used.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/240
  * Upon exception do a better job guessing the charset of the
    sourcefile when reading it in to display tracebacks.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/244
  * Removed jQuery code in the toolbar referring to a DOM node called
    'myTab', which doesn't seem to exist anymore.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/247
  * Updated the "Request Vars" panel:
    + 1. Show additional values that were previously missing
    + 2. Sections upgraded to link to Pyramid Documentation when
      possible
    + 3. Mako reformatted into "defs" for simpler reorganization in
      the future See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/241
  * Fix to prevent the toolbar from loading the session until it is
    actually accessed by the user. This avoids unnecessary parsing of
    the session object as well as waiting to parse it until later in
    the request which may meet more expectations of the session
    factory.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/249

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  8 07:13:34 UTC 2016 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * changed to https for source url
  * updated source url to files.pythonhosted.org
  * remove if case for suse version <= 1110

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 29 15:23:39 UTC 2015 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 2.4.2:
  * Fix a long-standing bug in which log messages were not rendered
    until the end of the response. By this time the arguments passed
    to the logger may no longer be valid (such as SQLAlchemy managed
    objects) and you would see a "DetachedInstanceError".  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/188

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 27 00:06:11 UTC 2015 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 2.4.1:
  * Remove the extra query hash constructed when indexing into SQL
    queries via url as it was unused after releasing 2.4.  See
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/232

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 08:52:24 UTC 2015 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- package and build python3 support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 30 14:40:48 UTC 2015 - hpj@urpla.net

- update to 2.4 (2015-06-04)
  * This release changes some details of the panel API, so if you are writing
    any custom panels for the toolbar please review the changes.
  * Document the cookie used to activate panels on a per-request basis. It is
    possible to specify the cookie per-request to turn on certain panels. This
    is used by default in the browser, but may also be used on a per-request
    basis by curl or other http APIs.
  * Add new debugtoolbar.active_panels setting which can specify certain panels
    to be always active.
  * Modify DebugPanel.name to be a valid python identifier, used for settings
    and lookup.
  * The toolbar no longer will clobber the request.id property. It now
    namespaces its usage as request.pdtb_id, freeing up request.id for
    applications.
  * Add a lock icon next to the request method in the sidebar if the request
    was accessed over https.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213
  * Update to bootstrap 3.1.1.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213
  * Fix display of POST variables where the same key is used multiple times.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/210
  * Fix auth callback so it protects the toolbar views. Auth system is tested
    now. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/226
  * Convert SQLAlchemy views to obtain the query and params internally; this
    allows executing queries with parameters that are not serializable.
    See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/227
  * Adds Pyramid version tests and bumps required Pyramid version to 1.4. The
    pyramid_mako dependency requires 1.3, but debugtoolbar also uses
    invoke_subrequest which was added in 1.4. The invoke_subrequest call was
    added in pyramid_debugtoolbar 2.0; if you need Pyramid 1.3 compatibility,
    try an older version.
