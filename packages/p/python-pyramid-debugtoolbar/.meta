  <title>An interactive HTML debugger for Pyramid application development</title>
  <description>A package which provides an interactive HTML debugger for Pyramid application development

Note that pyramid-debugtoolbar is a blatant rip-off of Michael van Tellingen's flask-debugtoolbar (which itself was derived from Rob Hudson's django-debugtoolbar). It also includes a lightly sanded down version of the Werkzeug debugger code by Armin Ronacher and team.
