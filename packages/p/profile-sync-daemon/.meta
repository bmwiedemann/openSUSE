  <title>Symlinks and syncs browser profile dirs to RAM thus reducing HDD/SDD calls</title>
  <description>Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage your
browser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically sync it back to your physical
disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative
use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization between the two. One of
the major design goals of psd is a completely transparent user experience.
