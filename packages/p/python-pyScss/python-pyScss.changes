- update to 1.3.5
  * The new less2scss module attempts to convert Less syntax to SCSS.
  * The *-exists functions from Sass 3.3 are now supported.
  * The contents of a file @import-ed in the middle of an input file
    now appears in the expected place, not at the end of the output.
  * Double-slashes within URLs, as often happens with base64-encoded
    data URLs, are no longer stripped as comments.
  * Nesting selectors that end with a combinator, e.g. div > { p {
    ... } }, now works correctly.
  * invert() is now left alone when the argument is a number,
    indicating the CSS filter rather than the Sass function.
  * if() now evaluates its arguments lazily.
  * str-slice() now silently corrects out-of-bounds indices.
  * append() now defaults to returning a space-delimited list, when
    the given list has fewer than two elements.
  * -moz-calc and -webkit-calc are recognized as variants of the
     calc() CSS function.
  * Filenames containing dots can now be imported.
  * Properties with a computed value of null are now omitted from the
    output.
  * The opacity token in IE's strange alpha(opacity=N) construct is
    now recognized case-insensitively.
  * The Compass gradient functions now recognize currentColor as a
    color.
  * The fonts extension should now work under Python 3.
  * Escaped astral plane characters no longer crash narrow Python 2
    builds.
  * The alpha value in rgba(...) is no longer truncated to only two
    decimal places.
  * Some edge cases with float precision were fixed, so 742px - 40px
    is no longer 701.99999999px.

- update to 1.2.1:
  * Bootstrap 3.2 compatibility fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 16:50:53 UTC 2014 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.2.0post3:
  * This is a significant release that greatly increases 
  compatibility with the reference compiler; in particular,
  the Sass port of Bootstrap now compiles.

  * There are a lot of changes here, so please feel free to
  report any bugs you see! The goal is 100% compatibility
   with the Ruby project.

  * Python 3 support. As a result, Python 2.5 no longer works;
  whether this is a bug or a feature is not yet clear.

  * It's possible to write custom Sass functions in Python,
  though the API for this is not final.

  * Experimental support for the map type and destructuring
  @each, both unreleased additions to the Ruby project.

  * Support for the new string and list functions in Sass 3.3.
  * Added background-brushed.

  Backwards-incompatible changes

  * Configuration via monkeypatching the scss module no
  longer works. Monkeypatch scss.config instead.
  * em and px are no longer compatible.
  * Unrecognized variable names are now a fatal error.
