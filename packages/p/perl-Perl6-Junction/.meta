<package name="perl-Perl6-Junction" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Perl6 style Junction operators in Perl5.</title>
  <description>This is a lightweight module which provides 'Junction' operators, the most
commonly used being 'any' and 'all'.

Inspired by the Perl6 design docs, the
http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E06.html manpage.

Provides a limited subset of the functionality of the
Quantum::Superpositions manpage, see the /&quot;SEE ALSO&quot; manpage for comment.

Notice in the the /SYNOPSIS manpage above, that if you want to match
against a regular expression, you must use '==' or '!='. *Not* '=~' or
'!~'. You must also use a regex object, such as 'qr/\d/', not a plain regex
such as '/\d/'.</description>
