%description
pytest-django allows testing Django projects/applications with the
pytest testing tool.

Running the test suite with pytest-django allows tapping into the features
that are already present in pytest:

* Manage test dependencies with pytest fixtures.
* Less boilerplate tests: no need to import unittest and creating a
  subclass with methods. Tests can be written as regular functions.
* Database re-use: no need to re-create the test database for every test run.
* Run tests in multiple processes for increased speed (with the pytest-xdist plugin).
* Make use of other pytest plugins.
* Works with both worlds: Existing unittest-style TestCase's still work without any modifications.
