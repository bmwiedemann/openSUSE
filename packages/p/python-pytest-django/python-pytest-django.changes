Mon Dec  5 22:34:03 UTC 2016 - buschmann23@opensuse.org

- Update to 3.1.2
  + Bug fixes
    * Auto clearing of mail.outbox has been re-introduced to not break
      functionality in 3.x.x release. This means that Compatibility
      issues mentioned in the 3.1.0 release are no longer present.

- Update to 3.1.1
  + Bug fixes
    * Workaround –pdb interaction with Django TestCase. The issue
      is caused by Django TestCase not implementing TestCase.debug()
      properly but was brought to attention with recent changes in
      pytest 3.0.2.

- Update to 3.1.0
  + Features
    * Added new function scoped fixture mailoutbox that gives access
      to djangos mail.outbox. The will clean/empty the mail.outbox
      to assure that no old mails are still in the outbox.
    * If django.contrib.sites is in your INSTALLED_APPS, Site cache
      will be cleared for each test to avoid hitting the cache and
      cause wrong Site object to be returned by Site.objects.get_current().
  + Compatibility
    * IMPORTANT: the internal autouse fixture _django_clear_outbox has
      been removed. If you have relied on this to get an empty outbox
      for your test, you should change tests to use the mailoutbox
      fixture instead. See documentation of mailoutbox fixture for usage.
      If you try to access mail.outbox directly, AssertionError will be raised.

- Update to 3.0.0
  + Bug fixes
    * Fix error when Django happens to be imported before
      pytest-django runs. Thanks to Will Harris for the bug report.
  + Features
    * Added a new option --migrations to negate a default usage of
      --nomigrations.
    * The previously internal pytest-django fixture that handles
      database creation and setup has been refactored, refined and
      made a public API.
  + Compoatibility
    * Official for the pytest 3.0.0 (2.9.2 release should work too,
      though). The documentation is updated to mention pytest instead
      of py.test.
    * Django versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 is no longer supported. The
      supported versions are now 1.7 and forward. Django master is
      supported as of 2016-08-21.
    * pytest-django no longer supports Python 2.6.
    * Specifying the DJANGO_TEST_LIVE_SERVER_ADDRESS environment
      variable is no longer supported. Use DJANGO_LIVE_TEST_SERVER_ADDRESS
      instead.
    * Ensuring accidental database access is now stricter than before.
      Previously database access was prevented on the cursor level. To
      be safer and prevent more cases, it is now prevented at the
      connection level. If you previously had tests which interacted
      with the databases without a database cursor, you will need to
      mark them with the pytest.mark.django_db() marker or request
      the db fixture.
    * The previously undocumented internal fixtures _django_db_setup,
      _django_cursor_wrapper have been removed in favour of the new
      public fixtures. If you previously relied on these internal
      fixtures, you must update your code.
