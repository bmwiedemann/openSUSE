  <title>character encodings in Perl</title>
  <description>The 'Encode' module provides the interface between Perl strings and the
rest of the system. Perl strings are sequences of _characters_.

The repertoire of characters that Perl can represent is a superset of those
defined by the Unicode Consortium. On most platforms the ordinal values of
a character as returned by 'ord(_S_)' is the _Unicode codepoint_ for that
character. The exceptions are platforms where the legacy encoding is some
variant of EBCDIC rather than a superset of ASCII; see the perlebcdic
manpage.

During recent history, data is moved around a computer in 8-bit chunks,
often called &quot;bytes&quot; but also known as &quot;octets&quot; in standards documents.
Perl is widely used to manipulate data of many types: not only strings of
characters representing human or computer languages, but also &quot;binary&quot;
data, being the machine's representation of numbers, pixels in an image, or
just about anything.

When Perl is processing &quot;binary data&quot;, the programmer wants Perl to process
&quot;sequences of bytes&quot;. This is not a problem for Perl: because a byte has
256 possible values, it easily fits in Perl's much larger &quot;logical
character&quot;.
