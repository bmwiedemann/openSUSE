  <title>perl-Dancer2-Plugin-DBIC - DBIx::Class interface for Dancer2 applications</title>
  <description>This plugin makes it very easy to create Dancer2 applications that interface with databases. It automatically exports the keyword 'schema' which returns a DBIx::Class::Schema object. It also exports the keywords 'resultset' and 'rset'. You just need to configure your database connection information. For performance, schema objects are cached in memory and are lazy loaded the first time they are accessed. This plugin is a thin wrapper around DBICx::Sugar.</description>
