  <title>ps utilities for /proc</title>
  <description>The procps package contains a set of system utilities that provide
system information. Procps includes ps, free, skill, snice, tload, top,
uptime, vmstat, w, and watch. The ps command displays a snapshot of
running processes. The top command provides a repetitive update of the
statuses of running processes. The free command displays the amounts of
free and used memory on your system. The skill command sends a
terminate command (or another specified signal) to a specified set of
processes. The snice command is used to change the scheduling priority
of specified processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current
system load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the
current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are
logged on, and system load averages for the past one, five, and fifteen
minutes. The w command displays a list of the users who are currently
logged on and what they are running. The watch program watches a
running program. The vmstat command displays virtual memory statistics
about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity.</description>
