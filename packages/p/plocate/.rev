    <comment>plocate is vastly superior (speed and database size) to mlocate while still being compatible. Mlocate is not developed since years, most major distributions switched to plocate a long time ago.
The idea is to replace mlocate eventually. This submission has &quot;provides:&quot; and &quot;obsoletes:&quot; for mlocate and findutils-locate, as other packages depend on them. When upgrading from mlocate to plocate, the user has to manually activate the systemd timer, as this is not done per default.
Otherwise, this SR should be completely compatible with mlocate and can replace it.
It is not possible to have a coexistence of plocate and mlocate, as some files have name conflicts.</comment>
