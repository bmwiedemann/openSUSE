- tweak file plocate-updatedb.service:
  * remove ProtectSystem=full (plocate ignores bind mounts by default)
  * add additional hardening taken from upstream version
- update to version 1.1.23:
  * Run updatedb with low scheduling priority
  * Avoid writing uninitialized header data
  * Don't leak file descriptor
  * Reset string explicitely to prevent undefined behavior
  * Suggest starting timer immediately instead of on reboot
  * Sandbox plocate-updatedb.service some more

- remove ConditionACPower systemd condition. Updates are generally
    fast, so no excessive battery drainage has to be expected.
    Reason for missing updates on laptops is not easy to figure out.
- remove rc* service link, sysV init has long gone.

Wed Jun 12 15:04:47 UTC 2024 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- changes taken from mlocate updates:
  * change umask inside su invocation (boo#1209409)
  * add comment why umask in service file is not effective (bsc#1218896)
  * add bcond for building without AppArmor support (for ALP code base)

Sat Jan 13 00:02:39 UTC 2024 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- remove fallback for _fillupdir in spec file, should be supported everywhere now
- update to version 1.1.22:
  * Revert the updatedb change in 1.1.21 that did not open
      pruned paths; it broke pruning of paths that were not at the root
      (e.g. /foo/bar, as opposed to /foo). Reported by David Caldwell

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 10 08:49:01 UTC 2024 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- use systemd timer file provided by the project
- update to version 1.1.21:
  * Improve interactions between pruning and bind mount detection logic
  * Pruned paths are now not opened, which can be useful in certain
      cases. Note that this does not (yet) apply to filesystems that
      are pruned due to type and not due to paths; they are still opened
      and then immediately closed again
- update to version 1.1.20:
  * Fix updatedb writing incomplete .db files under Termux
  * Make the systemd timer run more consistently during the night
  * Add an (undocumented) flag --ignore-visibility to plocate,
      giving the equivalent of building the database with
      --require-visibility no

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 30 07:39:31 UTC 2023 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- adjust patch disable-visibility.patch by also changing permission settings
- add compat symlink for man page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 25 14:36:19 UTC 2023 - Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>

- Initial rpm setup:
  * remove set-group bit of plocate and use RUN_UPDATEDB_AS mechanism from mlocate package
  * disable visibility check by default and make database file world readable
  * add apparmor profiles similar to mlocate package
  * create systemd units
  * use similar /etc/updatedb.conf config file as mlocate package
  * make package provide fake mlocate and findutils-locate version aliases
