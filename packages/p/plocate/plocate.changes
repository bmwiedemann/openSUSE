- remove fallback for _fillupdir in spec file, should be supported everywhere now
- update to version 1.1.22:
  * Revert the updatedb change in 1.1.21 that did not open
      pruned paths; it broke pruning of paths that were not at the root
      (e.g. /foo/bar, as opposed to /foo). Reported by David Caldwell

- use systemd timer file provided by the project
- update to version 1.1.21:
  * Improve interactions between pruning and bind mount detection logic
  * Pruned paths are now not opened, which can be useful in certain
      cases. Note that this does not (yet) apply to filesystems that
      are pruned due to type and not due to paths; they are still opened
      and then immediately closed again
- update to version 1.1.20:
  * Fix updatedb writing incomplete .db files under Termux
  * Make the systemd timer run more consistently during the night
  * Add an (undocumented) flag --ignore-visibility to plocate,
      giving the equivalent of building the database with
      --require-visibility no

- Initial rpm setup:
  * remove set-group bit of plocate and use RUN_UPDATEDB_AS mechanism from mlocate package

  * add apparmor profiles similar to mlocate package
  * create systemd units
  * use similar /etc/updatedb.conf config file as mlocate package
  * make package provide fake mlocate and findutils-locate version aliases
