  <title>PKCS #11 PAM Module</title>
  <description>This Linux PAM module allows X.509 a certificate-based user
authentication. The certificate and its dedicated private key are
thereby accessed by means of an appropriate PKCS #11 module. For the
verification of the users' certificates, locally stored CA certificates
as well as online or locally accessible CRLs are used.

Additionally, the package includes pam_pkcs11-related tools: *
   pkcs11_eventmgr: Generates actions on card insert, removal, or
   time-out events

* pklogin_finder: Gets the login name that maps to a certificate

* pkcs11_inspect: Inspects the contents of a certificate

* make_hash_links: Creates hash link directories for storing CAs and
CRLs</description>
