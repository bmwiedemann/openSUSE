%description
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for Python,
that is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It can be used
as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types
supported by the Python Imaging Library, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF,
and others, whereas tesseract-ocr, by default, only supports TIFF and BMP.
Additionally, if used as a script, python-tesseract will print the recognized
text instead of writing it to a file. There is no support for confidence estimates and
bounding box data is planned for future releases.
