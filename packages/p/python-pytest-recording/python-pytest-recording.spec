%description
A pytest plugin that records network interactions in your tests
via VCR.py.

Features
 * Straightforward `pytest.mark.vcr`, that reflects
   `VCR.use_cassettes` API;
 * Combining multiple VCR cassettes
 * Network access blocking;
 * The `rewrite` recording mode that rewrites cassettes
   from scratch.
