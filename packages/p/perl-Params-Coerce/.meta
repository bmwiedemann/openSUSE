  <title>Allows your classes to do coercion of parameters</title>
  <description>A big part of good API design is that we should be able to be flexible in the
ways that we take parameters.

Params::Coerce attempts to encourage this, by making it easier to take a
variety of different arguments, while adding negligable additional complexity
to your code.
