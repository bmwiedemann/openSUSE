  <title>Perform Diffs on Files and Record Sets</title>
  <description>&quot;diff()&quot; provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU &quot;diff&quot;
utility. It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU &quot;diff&quot;, but
it is better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is
often faster than shelling out to a system's &quot;diff&quot; executable for small
files, and generally slower on larger files.

Relies on Algorithm::Diff for, well, the algorithm. This may not produce
the same exact diff as a system's local &quot;diff&quot; executable, but it will
be a valid diff and comprehensible by &quot;patch&quot;. We haven't seen any
differences between Algorithm::Diff's logic and GNU diff's, but we have
not examined them to make sure they are indeed identical.
