  <title>Check for memory leaks and circular memory references</title>
  <description>Perl's garbage collection has one big problem: Circular references can't 
get cleaned up. A circular reference can be as simple as two reference 
that refer to each other.

Test::Memory::Cycle is built on top of Devel::Cycle to give you an easy 
way to check for these circular references.</description>
