- Add nofail-neg-test.patch to fix OpenSSL configuration on SUSE
  platforms (gh#sigstore/sigstore-python!1605).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to 4.1.0:
  - cli: Support using other Sigstore instances with --instance
    URL. New instances are trusted with new top level command
    trust-instance ROOTFILE. #1548
  - Added cryptography 46 to list of compatible cryptography
    releases (#1544)
  - Improved error message when verifying bundles with
    unsupported log entry versions (#1569)
  - cli: Always read/write UTF-8. This fixes an issue on Windows
    where the platform default encoding was used: the issue has
    existed for a while, but became more visible with signature
    bundles that contain rekor2 entries. #1553
- Update to 4.0.0:
  This is a major release with a host of API and functionality
  changes. The major new feature is Rekor v2 support but many
  other changes are also included, see list below.
  - cli: Add --rekor-version to sign command arguments: This
    can be useful if Sigstore instance provides multiple Rekor
    versions and user wants to override the default choice #1471
  - cli: Support parallel signing. When multiple artifacts are
    signed, the Rekor requests are submitted in parallel: this is
    especially useful with Rekor v2. #1468, #1478, #1485
  - oidc (API): Allow custom audience claims via API #1402
  - rekor (API): Support Rekor v2 (aka rekor-tiles) in both
    verification and signing. #1370, #1422, #1432
  - trust (API): Make TrustedRoot, SigningConfig and
    ClientTrustConfig public API #1496
  - cli: Improve verify UX when wrong instance is used #1510
  - deps: replace sigstore_protobuf_specs dependency with
    sigstore-models #1470
  - trust: Update embedded TUF root #1515
  - trust (API): TrustConfig now provides the production()and
    staging() helpers. Similar methods were removed from
    SigningConfig, TrustedRoot, SigningContext and Issuer. Use
    TrustConfig everywhere in code base. #1363
  - trust (API): support SigningConfig v0.2, remove support for
    v0.1. The new format now fully defines the sigstore instance
    the client uses. SigningConfig class now has methods to
    return actual clients (like RekorClient) instead of just URLs
    for that sigstore instance. The --trust-config cli option now
    expects the trust config to contain a v0.2 SigningConfig.
    #1358, #1407
  - trust: Support ed25519 keys in trusted root #1377
  - rekor: resolve circular import of LogEntry #1458
  - rekor: Fix checkpoint signature lookup when there are
    multiple signatures #1514
  - rekor: Fix entry handling so inclusion promise is optional
    #1382
  - rekor: Avoid trailing slash in post to /entries #1366
  - sign: fetch TSA timestamps before submitting an entry to
    Rekor #1463
  - timestamp: Specify sha256 in TSA timestamp request #1373
  - trust: Fail less hard when trusted root contains unknown keys
    #1424
  - verify: Fix TSA cert chain construction (fixes issue in the
    case where certificate is not embedded in the timestamp)
    #1482
  - verify: Use TSA hash algorithm specified in the timestamp
    (SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 are supported) #1385
  - verify: Check artifact signing time against all established
    times #1381
  - verify: Handle unset TSA timestamp validity end #1368
- Update to 3.6.6:
  - Improved error message when verifying bundles with rekor v2
    entries (#1565)
  - Added cryptography 46 to list of compatible cryptography
    releases (#1566)
- Update to 3.6.5:
  - Fixed verified time handling so that additional timestamps
    cannot break otherwise valid signature bundles (#1492)
  - Added cryptography 45 to list of compatible cryptography
    releases (#1498)
- Update to 3.6.4:
  - Bumped the rfc3161-client dependency to >=1.0.3 to fix a
    security vulnerability (#1451)
- Update to 3.6.3:
  - Verify: Avoid hard failure if trusted root contains
    unsupported keytypes (as verification may succeed without
    that key). #1425
- Add fix-ecparam-testing.patch patch to overcome a FTBFS bug
  (gh#sigstore/sigstore-python#1603).

Wed Apr 16 01:48:26 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.6.2:
  * Fixed issue where a trust root with multiple rekor keys was not considered
    valid.
  * Upgraded python-tuf dependency to 6.0.
  * Updated the embedded TUF root to version 12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 21 08:19:18 UTC 2025 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Initial version (3.6.1)
