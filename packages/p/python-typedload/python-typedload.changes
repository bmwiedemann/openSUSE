- Update to 2.39:
  * Fix unintended behaviour where a str could be loaded as list[str]. This
    is caused by a quirk of python's types. To restore the previous behaviour
    set iterstr=True
  * Drop support to python 3.9
  * Do not use new syntax in any place. It confuses tooling
  * Drop support for EOL versions of python
  * Support typing.ReadOnly
  * Add support for typing.TypeAliasType (PEP 695)
  * Add tests to make sure mypy validation works
  * Fix mypy failure when loading a Literal directly
  * Remove cloudflare tracking from html documentation once again -_-
  * Improve documentation
  * Improve typechecks
  * Support Required for TypedDict
  * Make example more current
  * Fix bug with dumping dataclasses with slots
  * Improve performance for loading unions of objects #12
  * Improve performance for dumping dataclasses #13 #14
  * Improve performance for loading various types
  * Fix bug when loading attrs objects with missing attributes, the correct
    exception is raised #9
  * Raise TypeError instead of ValueError when there is a problem with the
    arguments of the objects This is in line with what python does #9
  * Fix bug for dumping object with a ForwardRef to itself #8
  * Fix bug where dictionary load would fail if the type for the value wasn't
    cached already

Wed Dec 13 10:19:48 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.26:
  * Update type hints file
  * Improve performance for loading objects
    (attrs/dataclasses/NamedTuple)
  * Improve performance for loading dictionary keys that are
    basic types
  * Improve performance for loading dataclasses
  * Switch performance tests to test against pydantic2
  * Drop support to Python 3.7 (which has reached EOL)
  * Make is_optional slightly faster
  * Keep track of the index when loading iterables the first time
  * It makes the normal case slightly slower, and gives massive
    performance improvements when exceptions are raised.
  * When loading a string into datetime.date/time/datetime, ISO
    8601 is used
  * When dumping, setting `isodates=True` dumps an ISO 8601
    string instead of a list of ints. The previous behaviour is
    now deprecated.
  * Add support for datetime.timedelta. It is dumped as a float
    representing seconds
  * Deprecate dump handlers without type hints
  * Improve performance for dumping, by carrying type hints
  * Remove `jsons` and `dataclasses-json` from benchmarks.
  * They were too slow to be a useful comparison.
  * Improve loading time for literals
  * Support attrs converter
  * Drop support to Python 3.5 and 3.6
  * Improve performance for dumping
  * Generate pure python wheel
  * Switch to setuptools
  * Since python decided to drop the only installation method
    available within the stdlib
  * Add pyproject.toml
