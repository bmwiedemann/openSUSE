- update to 2.26:
  * Update type hints file
  * Improve performance for loading objects
    (attrs/dataclasses/NamedTuple)
  * Improve performance for loading dictionary keys that are
    basic types
  * Improve performance for loading dataclasses
  * Switch performance tests to test against pydantic2
  * Drop support to Python 3.7 (which has reached EOL)
  * Make is_optional slightly faster
  * Keep track of the index when loading iterables the first time
  * It makes the normal case slightly slower, and gives massive
    performance improvements when exceptions are raised.
  * When loading a string into datetime.date/time/datetime, ISO
    8601 is used
  * When dumping, setting `isodates=True` dumps an ISO 8601
    string instead of a list of ints. The previous behaviour is
    now deprecated.
  * Add support for datetime.timedelta. It is dumped as a float
    representing seconds
  * Deprecate dump handlers without type hints
  * Improve performance for dumping, by carrying type hints
  * Remove `jsons` and `dataclasses-json` from benchmarks.
  * They were too slow to be a useful comparison.
  * Improve loading time for literals
  * Support attrs converter
  * Drop support to Python 3.5 and 3.6
  * Improve performance for dumping
  * Generate pure python wheel
  * Switch to setuptools
  * Since python decided to drop the only installation method
    available within the stdlib
  * Add pyproject.toml
