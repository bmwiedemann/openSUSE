  <title>Check syntax, presence of use strict; and test coverage</title>
  <description>The most basic test one can write is &quot;does it compile ?&quot;. This module tests if the code compiles and play nice with 'Test::Simple' modules.

Another good practice this module can test is to &quot;use strict;&quot; in all perl files.

By setting a minimum test coverage through 'all_cover_ok()', a code author can ensure his code is tested above a preset level of *kwality* throughout the development cycle.

Along with the Test::Pod, this module can provide the first tests to setup for a module author.
