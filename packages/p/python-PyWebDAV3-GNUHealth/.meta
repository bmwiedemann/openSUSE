  <title>Python3-based WebDAV server </title>
  <description>Python WebDAV implementation (level 1 and 2) that features a library that enables you to integrate WebDAV server capabilities to your application.
A fully working example on how to use the library is included. You can find a server in the DAVServer package. This server is fully functional and can even be run as daemon.
If you search an easy to use WebDAV server that supports most clients (cadaver, Mac OS X Finder, Windows Explorer, ...) then try out PyWebDAV. 
This Version is patched to work with GNU Health 3.2. Temporary solution until PyWebDAV maintainer has applied the changes</description>
