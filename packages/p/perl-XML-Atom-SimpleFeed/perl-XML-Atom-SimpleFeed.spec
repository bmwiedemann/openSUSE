%description
This is a minimal API for generating Atom syndication feeds quickly and
easily. It supports all aspects of the Atom format itself but has no
mechanism for the inclusion of extension elements.

You can supply strings for most things, and the module will provide useful
defaults. When you want more control, you can provide data structures, as
documented, to specify more particulars.
