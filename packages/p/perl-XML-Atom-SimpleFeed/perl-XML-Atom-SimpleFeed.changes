  0.900 Tue 22 Sep 2015
  	- Support for arbitrary XML encodings
  
  	[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
  	- Removal of ->no_generator method.
  
  	  To suppress the default generator tag, specify an undef generator.
  
  0.863 Thu 10 Sep 2015
  	[INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
  	- Datetime object support now via ->epoch method instead of ->strftime.
  
  	  Despite the fact that this is an incompatible change, it should actually
  	  be a non-event for almost all users, because every datetime module with
  	  a ->strftime method that I could find on CPAN also has an ->epoch method
  	  (as well as vice versa).
  
  	  However, the ->strftime methods of many modules are (subtly or badly)
  	  broken in the face of timezones, even as their ->epoch methods work right
  	  (or else are broken subtly enough to escape notice).
  
  	  But if you have written your own datetime class, and it has a ->strftime
  	  method but not an ->epoch method, and you pass an instance of your class
  	  to an instance of this module, then the feeds you generate that way will
  	  now be broken.
  
  	  On balance, I believe that this change will unbreak vastly more code than
  	  it breaks. Therefore I decided to switch.
  
  0.862 Tue 08 Sep 2015
  	- Correct RFC 3339 formatting for datetime objects
  	  (Thanks, virii)
