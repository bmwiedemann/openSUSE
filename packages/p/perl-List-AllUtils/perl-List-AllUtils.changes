  - Nothing from List::UtilsBy was actually being exported, because of a type
    and a lack of testing. Reported by Greg Oschwald. GitHub #5.

  - Switched from List::MoreUtils to List::SomeUtils. This should not change any
    functionality of the module.
  
  - Make the test for subroutine redefined warnings much more
    specific. Previously tests could fail because of totally unrelated warnings
    from other modules. Reported by ribasushi. RT #113740.

  - Clarify which of List::Util and List::MoreUtils wins when they both provide
    the same function. Requested by Karen Etheridge. RT #98560.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 17 09:27:56 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 0.08
 - This version now works with both List::MoreUtils 0.28-0.33 and the latest
   trial version, 0.400_006. Note that it does not work with earlier versions
   of 0.400.

- updated to 0.07
 - The last version totally broke all exports from List::MoreUtils. Now there
   are actual tests for this. Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa. RT #89509.
 - List::Util 1.33 provides some subs that are also provided by
   List::MoreUtils. This caused subroutine redefeined warnings. List::AllUtils
   now only imports subs from List::MoreUtils that aren't defined by
   List::Util. This works with List::Util 1.31+. Reported by Zefram. RT #89467.

   Changes. Reported by Przemysław Wesołek. RT #88296
 - Updated to require List::Util 1.31, which includes a bunch of new pairwise
   functions.
 - Updated docs to match List::MoreUtils 0.28+. Reported by ilmari. RT #75196.
