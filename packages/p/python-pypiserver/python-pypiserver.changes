- %python3_only -> %python_alternative

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 13:11:12 UTC 2020 - pgajdos@suse.com

- version update to 1.3.2
  - ENH: The Dockerfile used for the official Docker images now uses Python 3.6
    rather than Python 2.7 (#284, thanks @etene!)
  - ENH: The `welcome.html` page has been updated to provide more metadata
    and be more HTML-standards compliant (#283, thanks @maggyero!)
  - FIX: the `pypi-server -U` command no longer fails when run inside the
    Docker container (thanks to @mkolb-navican for reporting in #264)
  - FIX: The `remove_pkg` API action now removes any extant instances of a
    package name-version combination, not just the first one found. This means
    that now, for example, if a `.whl` and `.tar.gz` file exist for the
    requested package name and version, both will be removed (thanks to
    @esciara for reporting in #268)
  - FIX: include missing `simple/` path on a URL in the example pip commands
    on the `welcome.html` page (@276, thanks @maggyero!)
  - DOC: more consistent and accurate documentation for pip commands provided
    on the `welcome.html` page (#278, thanks @maggyero!)
  - DOC: fixes to the README to make it easier for people to use pypiserver
    behind an apache webserver (#289, thanks @Helveg!)
  - FIX: previously, it was possible to upload packages with hashing algorithms
    other than md5, but downloading them again with pip was impossible due to
    incorrect truncation of the hash. This has been fixed! (Thanks
    @ArneBachmann for figuring out what was wrong and reporting the issue
    in #265).
  - FIX: argument parsing would previously fail for the short form of
    ``--help``, due an incorrect operator used during comparison (thanks to
    @maggyero, #271)
  - DOC: significant improvements to formatting and consistency in the README
    (thanks to @maggyero, #270)

Thu Mar 19 07:34:24 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Fix build without python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 14 23:38:33 UTC 2019 - svasudevan@suse.com

- Create new python package for pypiserver
  * pypiserver now consistently and correctly handles the X-Forwarded-Host
    header to allow for alternative base URLs
  * significantly more information added to the docker-compose.yml
    example, including recipes for various configuration options
  * removed outdated suggestion to serve the packages data directly via
    a webserver and replaced with information about setting up nginx
    caching
