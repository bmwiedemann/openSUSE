- Create new python package for pypiserver
  * pypiserver now consistently and correctly handles the X-Forwarded-Host
    header to allow for alternative base URLs
  * significantly more information added to the docker-compose.yml
    example, including recipes for various configuration options
  * removed outdated suggestion to serve the packages data directly via
    a webserver and replaced with information about setting up nginx
    caching
