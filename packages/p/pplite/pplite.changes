- Update to release 0.11
  * Adds a prototype implementation of the finite powerset of Poly
    elements (PSet).
  * Provides an efficiency-improved version of the F_Poly domain.
  * The finite powerset domain is now a class template:
    pre-generated instances, include finite sets of boxed polyhedra
    (P_Set) and finite sets of Cartesian factored boxed polyhedra
    (FP_Set).
  * Added support for the integral split operator.
  * Added new method `Index_Set get_unconstrained` to polyhedra
    domains, returning the set of unconstrained space dimensions.

- Update to release 0.7
  * This version also adds a C++ polymorphic interface allowing to
    experiment with several variants of the domain of convex
    polyhedra: Poly, U_Poly, F_Poly, UF_Poly and their XXX_Stats
    versions, computing timing information for abstract operators.
