%description
pgloader imports data from different kind of sources and COPY it into
PostgreSQL.

The command language is described in the manual page and allows to describe
where to find the data source, its format, and to describe data processing
and transformation.

Supported source formats include SQL Server, CSV, fixed width flat files,
dBase3 files (DBF), and SQLite and MySQL databases. In most of those formats,
pgloader is able to auto-discover the schema and create the tables and the
indexes in PostgreSQL. In the MySQL case it's possible to edit CASTing rules
from the pgloader command directly.

#
# SBCL "programs" are similar to self-extracting archives, i.e. they are
# comprised of a well-known stub plus some data appended. Such appendages
# (called "core" in SBCL) are generally prone to getting removed by e.g.
# strip, upx, etc.
#
# Build just the core. This has two benefits:
# * reuse /usr/bin/sbcl interpreter and save bytes
# * the core itself is not ELF, so not subject to strip
