- update to 1.0.0:
  * Some of the major work has been on making performance
    improvements to the more data intensive parts of the package.
    There should be some improvements across the board, however
    some exciting new performance features include:
  * A new HTTP transfer mechanism that uses a pool of background
    worker threads to transmit logs and reports to the Rollbar
    system. You can enable it with the following...
  * Removed Python 2
  * Fixed handling `sensitive_post_parameters` decorator in
    Django
  * Fixed Werkzeug DeprecationWarning of `BaseRequest`
  * Fixed missing locals shortening on items with "trace_chain"
    instead of "trace"
  * Fixed FastAPI version comparison
  * Fixed #436 `WSGIRequest` has no attribute
    `sensitive_post_parameters`.
  * Added new `thread_pool` handler
  * Added Rollbar branding to the readme
  * Added batched transform to increase sanitization and
    serialization performance
