%description
This Python module provides unicode emoji output for strings containing emoji codes.
In addition to the official list defined by the unicode consortium a whole bunch of aliases is defined.

Example:
>> import emoji
>> print(emoji.emojize('Python is :thumbs_up:'))
Python is üëç
>> print(emoji.emojize('Python is :thumbsup:', use_aliases=True))
Python is üëç

By default, the language is English (``language='en'``) but Spanish (``'es'``), Portuguese (``'pt'``) and Italian (``'it'``) are also supported.
