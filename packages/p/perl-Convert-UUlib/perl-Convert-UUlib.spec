%description
This module started as an interface to the uulib/uudeview library by Frank
Pilhofer that can be used to decode all kinds of usenet (and other) binary
messages.

After upstream abondoned the project, th library was continuously bugfixed
and improved in this module, with major focuses on security fixes,
correctness and speed (that does not mean that this library is considered
safe with untrusted data, but it surely is safer than the poriginal
uudeview).

Read the file doc/library.pdf from the distribution for in-depth
information about the C-library used in this interface, and the rest of
this document and especially the non-trivial decoder program at the end.
