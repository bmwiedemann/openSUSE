- Skip python36 build: Due to NEP 29, python36-scipy in TW is no
  more. Numpy and the lal packages follow

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 19:33:51 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Fix up tests and binary installation to account for multiple
  python versions.
- Use mutibuild to split up main pkg building and tests since
  tests require the binaries which are installed using
  /etc/alternatives.

- Update to version 1.7.0:
  * Replace gz= keyword with compress= and expand auto format
    detection features.
  * Implement ligolw_no_ilwdchar as a module for reuse.
  * Move programs into separate -bin package on Debian.
  * Expand SimInspiral row type:  add methods to compute effective
    distance instead of relying on columns with these numbers
    precomputed;  doing this to allow analysis codes to add
    support for KAGRA in a way that is uniform across detectors.
  * Remove table.Table._end_of_rows() hook.
  * Reimplement most of ligo.lw.utils.process as methods and
    feature improvements within Process and ProcessParams row
    types.
  * Do the same for SearchSummary.
  * Array.Array:  add .shape property.
  * Add support for +/-inf to lsctables.gpsproperty_with_gmst.
  * Convert C modules to native Python 2 & 3 versions and remove
    six.h from build.
  * Switch test suite to Python 3.  adds xmllint build dependency
    because Python 3 can't be relied upon to produce consistent
    XML output.
  * Add test of ligolw_sqlite's --tmp-space feature.
  * Fix ligolw_sqlite's --tmp-space feature on Python 3 by
    converting working copy mechanism to a context handler which
    does its own clean-up, instead of hooking into the guts of
    NamedTemporaryFile.
  * Various documentation improvements, including new
    documentation to expand doctest based test suite coverage.
  * Replace glue.text_progress_bar with tqdm (new dependency).
- Run tests as part of %check section (python3 and 64-bit only);
  include all Requires as BuildRequires, plus diffutils (for cmp),
  libxml2-tools (for xmllint), python3, and python-matplotlib.
- Replace the use of "distutils.core" with "setuptools"; ligo.lw
  module is not found when the former is used (see
  https://git.ligo.org/kipp.cannon/python-ligo-lw/-/issues/16).
- Add ligo-lw-segments-test-fix.patch to fix a test that randomly
  fails due to dictionary ordering being undefined (sent
  upstream).
- Update URL: previous URL no longer accessible.
- New Requires: python-tqdm.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 15 14:57:55 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Drop unnecessary BuildRequires python-ligo-common and

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 27 22:12:34 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * Remove custom ProcessParamsTable from dbtables.
  * Remove .update_column_info() method from table.Table.
  * Remove abandoned experiment tables from lsctables.
  * Remove unused "interning" feature from RowBuilder.
  * Improve start/stop attribute handling in a variety of
    lsctables row and table types.
  * (re-)fix printing null-valued table cells in ligolw_print.
  * Some test suite and packaging updates.
- Add Requires: python-python-dateutil.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 23 10:03:03 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * fix typo in lsctables.py
  * disable unit tests during .deb build
  * fix quoting of version string in .rpm

  * add missing python-dateutil dependency
  * don't require lalburst, just recommend it
  * add glue-ligolw-tools clean-up deps for python 3
- Changes from version 1.5.0:
  * port Leo's Python 3 doctest fixes from glue that had been left
    behind
  * build script fixes
  * restore ligolw_segments to this package
  * update for offsetvector's move to lalburst (adds lalburst
    dependency)
