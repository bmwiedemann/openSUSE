- update to 6.0.0:
  * #419: Declared ``Distribution`` as an abstract class, enforcing
  definition of abstract methods in instantiated subclasses. It's no
  longer possible to instantiate a ``Distribution`` or any subclasses
  unless they define the abstract methods.
  * #371: Deprecated expectation that ``PackageMetadata.__getitem__``
  will return ``None`` for missing keys. In the future, it will raise a
  ``KeyError``.

   parts of the extension in the result.
 * #381: In ``PathDistribution._normalized_name``, ensure names
   loaded from the stem of the filename are also normalized, ensuring
   duplicate entry points by packages varying only by non-normalized
   name are hidden.

Mon Sep 20 11:37:47 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>
  
- Update to v4.8.1 
   * #348: Restored support for EntryPoint access by item,
     deprecating support in the process. Users are advised to use
     direct member access instead of item-based access:
      - ep[0] -> ep.name
      - ep[1] -> ep.value
      - ep[2] -> ep.group
      - ep[:] -> ep.name, ep.value, ep.group
- Release v4.8.0
  * #337: Rewrote EntryPoint as a simple class, still immutable
    and still with the attributes, but without any expectation for
    namedtuple functionality such as _asdict.
- Release v4.7.1
  * #344: Fixed regression in packages_distributions when neither
    top-level.txt nor a files manifest is present.
- Release v4.7.0
  * #330: In packages_distributions, now infer top-level names
    from .files() when a top-level.txt (Setuptools-specific
    metadata) is not present.
- Release v4.6.4
  * #334: Correct SimplePath protocol to match pathlib protocol 
    for __truediv__.
- Release v4.6.3
  * Moved workaround for #327 to _compat module.
- Release v4.6.2
  * bpo-44784: Avoid errors in test suite when DeprecationWarnings 
    are treated as errors.
- Release v4.6.1
  * #327: Deprecation warnings now honor call stack variance on 
    PyPy.
- Release v4.6.0
  * #326: Performance tests now rely on pytest-perf. To disable 
    these tests, which require network access and a git checkout, 
    pass -p no:perf to pytest.
- Release v4.5.0
  * #319: Remove SelectableGroups deprecation exception for flake8.
- Release v4.4.0
  * #300: Restore compatibility in the result from Distribution.
    entry_points (EntryPoints) to honor expectations in older 
    implementations and issuing deprecation warnings for these 
    cases:
  * EntryPoints objects are once again mutable, allowing for sort
    () and other list-based mutation operations. Avoid deprecation 
    warnings by casting to a mutable sequence (e.g. list(dist.
    entry_points).sort()).
  * EntryPoints results once again allow for access by index. To 
    avoid deprecation warnings, cast the result to a Sequence 
    first (e.g. tuple(dist.entry_points)[0]).
- Release v4.3.1
  * #320: Fix issue where normalized name for eggs was incorrectly 
    solicited, leading to metadata being unavailable for eggs.
- Release v4.3.0
  * #317: De-duplication of distributions no longer requires 
    loading the full metadata for PathDistribution objects, entry 
    point loading performance by ~10x.
- Release v4.2.0
  * Prefer f-strings to .format calls.
- Release v4.1.0
  * #312: Add support for metadata 2.2 (Dynamic field).
  * #315: Add SimplePath protocol for interface clarity in 
    PathDistribution.
- Release v4.0.1
  * #306: Clearer guidance about compatibility in readme.
- Release v4.0.0
  * #304: PackageMetadata as returned by metadata() and 
    Distribution.metadata() now provides normalized metadata 
    honoring PEP 566:
  * If a long description is provided in the payload of the RFC 
    822 value, it can be retrieved as the Description field.
  * Any multi-line values in the metadata will be returned as such.
  * For any multi-line values, line continuation characters are 
    removed. This backward-incompatible change means that any 
    projects relying on the RFC 822 line continuation characters 
    being present must be tolerant to them having been removed.
  * Add a json property that provides the metadata converted to a 
    JSON-compatible form per PEP 566.
- Release v3.10.1
  * Minor tweaks from CPython.
- Release v3.10.0
  * #295: Internal refactoring to unify section parsing logic.

  * #297: Fix ValueError when entry points contains comments.
- Release v3.9.0
  * Use of Mapping (dict) interfaces on SelectableGroups is now 
    flagged as deprecated. Instead, users are advised to use the 
    select interface for future compatibility.
  * Suppress the warning with this filter: ignore:SelectableGroups 
    dict interface.  
  * Or with this invocation in the Python environment: warnings.
    filterwarnings('ignore', 'SelectableGroups dict interface').
  * Preferably, switch to the select interface introduced in
    3.7.0. See the entry points documentation and changelog for 
    the 3.6 release below for more detail.
  * For some use-cases, especially those that rely on importlib.
    metadata in Python 3.8 and 3.9 or those relying on older 
    importlib_metadata (especially on Python 3.5 and earlier), 
    backports.entry_points_selectable was created to ease the 
    transition. Please have a look at that project if simply 
    relying on importlib_metadata 3.6+ is not straightforward. 
    Background in #298.
  * #283: Entry point parsing no longer relies on ConfigParser and 
    instead uses a custom, one-pass parser to load the config, 
    resulting in a ~20% performance improvement when loading entry 
    points.
- Release v3.8.2
  * #293: Re-enabled lazy evaluation of path lookup through a 
    FreezableDefaultDict.
- Release v3.8.1
  * #293: Workaround for error in distribution search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 12 21:29:20 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.7.2:
  * Cleaned up cruft in entry_points docstring.
  * Internal refactoring to facilitate ``entry_points() -> dict``
    deprecation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  2 00:20:59 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.7.0:
  * #131: Added ``packages_distributions`` to conveniently
    resolve a top-level package or module to its distribution(s).
  * #284: Introduces new ``EntryPoints`` object, a tuple of
    ``EntryPoint`` objects but with convenience properties for
    selecting and inspecting the results:

    - ``.select()`` accepts ``group`` or ``name`` keyword
      parameters and returns a new ``EntryPoints`` tuple
      with only those that match the selection.
    - ``.groups`` property presents all of the group names.
    - ``.names`` property presents the names of the entry points.
    - Item access (e.g. ``eps[name]``) retrieves a single
      entry point by name.

    ``entry_points`` now accepts "selection parameters",
    same as ``EntryPoint.select()``.

    ``entry_points()`` now provides a future-compatible
    ``SelectableGroups`` object that supplies the above interface
    but remains a dict for compatibility.

    In the future, ``entry_points()`` will return an
    ``EntryPoints`` object, but provide for backward
    compatibility with a deprecated  ``__getitem__``
    accessor by group and a ``get()`` method.

    If passing selection parameters to ``entry_points``, the
    future behavior is invoked and an ``EntryPoints`` is the
    result.

    Construction of entry points using
    ``dict([EntryPoint, ...])`` is now deprecated and raises
    an appropriate DeprecationWarning and will be removed in
    a future version.
  * #280: ``entry_points`` now only returns entry points for
    unique distributions (by name).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 24 18:15:12 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.4.0:
  * Project now declares itself as being typed.
  * Additional performance enhancements to distribution
    discovery.
  * For PyPA projects, add test ensuring that
    ``MetadataPathFinder._search_paths`` honors the needed
    interface. Method is still private. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 19 23:29:59 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- New version requires typing_extensions for Python < 3.8
  (Leap and TW python36 flavor)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 19 17:48:18 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.3.0:
  * * #265: ``EntryPoint`` objects now expose a ``.dist`` object
    referencing the ``Distribution`` when constructed from a
    Distribution.
  * The object returned by ``metadata()`` now has a
    formally-defined protocol called ``PackageMetadata``
    with declared support for the ``.get_all()`` method.
    Fixes #126.
- add typing-extensions dependency for older python versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    package normalization rules.
- Update in v3.0.0
  * Require Python 3.6 or later.
- Upstream switched to pytest, so do we
- Revert last change: The condition for **BuildRequires** does not
  make any sense, as that would also prevent the install of 
  python36-importlib_resources into the build environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 18:11:11 UTC 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Reintroduce into Tumbleweed for python36 flavor
- Update to 2.0.0 
  * importlib_metadata no longer presents a __version__ attribute. 
    Consumers wishing to resolve the version of the package should 
    query it directly with 
    importlib_metadata.version('importlib-metadata'). Closes #71.
- v1.7.0
  * PathNotFoundError now has a custom __str__ mentioning “package 
    metadata” being missing to help guide users to the cause when 
    the package is installed but no metadata is present. Closes 
    #124.
- v1.6.1
  * Added Distribution._local() as a provisional demonstration of 
    how to load metadata for a local package. Implicitly requires 
    that pep517 is installed. Ref #42.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 09:33:46 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.0
  * Renamed package parameter to distribution_name.
  * For better compatibility with the stdlib implementation and to 
    avoid the same distributions being discovered by the stdlib 
    and backport implementations, the backport now disables the 
    stdlib DistributionFinder during initialization (import time).
  * Project adopts semver for versioning.
  * EntryPoints are now pickleable.
  * Dropped support for Python 3.4.
  * Fixed repr(EntryPoint) on PyPy.
  * Repaired project metadata to correctly declare the python_requires directive.
  * Through careful optimization, distribution() is 3-4x faster.
  * When searching through sys.path, if any error occurs attempting 
    to list a path entry, that entry is skipped, making the system 
    much more lenient to errors.
