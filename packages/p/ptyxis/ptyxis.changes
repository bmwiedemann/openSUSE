Tue Oct 29 20:39:21 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 47.4:
  + Work around Podman in `--additional-flags` parsing to fix
    execution of distrobox containers.
  + Prioritize "manager":"distrobox" over
    "com.github.containers.toolbox" label because F41 images
    created by distrobox are, for some reason, setting the toolbox
    label id.
  + Fix raising of window when activating shell notification.
  + Override distro-theming for `vte-terminal` CSS element. This
    fixes styling on Ubuntu-based systems, but possibly others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 19 09:20:36 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 47.3:
  + Fix race condition in connecting to exited/signaled D-Bus
    signals from PtyxisIpcProcess. This fixes situations where
    quick running scripts exit before attaching to said signals,
    generally during application startup.
  + Fix --preserve-fds=0 error on distrobox.
  + Check tiled state in new-window action to start in windowed
    mode.
  + Fix detach-tab shortcut.

    adding or removing tabs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 11 20:29:14 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 47.rc:
  + Ctrl+shift+w now set as default shortcut for closing a tab,
    matching GNOME Terminal.
  + Preferences window improvements.
  + Updated GNOME Terminal palettes.
  + UI changes to improve screen reader support.
  + Make CSS provider priority less than the GTK inspector.
  + Styling improvements to match Builder and Text Editor.
  + Fix support for enabling login shells.
  + Convenience API for distros which require downstream patching
    for current directory tracking (such as Debian).
  + Fix container tracking and notifications via termprops.
  + Show opacity toggle if the setting has been changed.
  + Handle new tab creation when directory is in a GVFS FUSE path.
  + Reduce agent poll priority when ^C is pressed.
  + Overview styling and live-preview improvements to updated
    immediately when preferences changes.
  + Fix missing shortcut bindings for reset and reset-and-clear.
- Changes from version 47.beta:
  + Ptyxis no longer requires patches to VTE when using a recent
    VTE git tag for GNOME 47.
  + Legacy libc compat was dropped for 32-bit x86 as it is
    unnecessary.
  + Window pallete and styling improvements to match GNOME 47
    styling.
  + A new gsetting to disable padding around the terminal, at the
    cost of runtime performance.
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 47.alpha:
  + Many updates for GNOME HIG across dialogs and widgetry.
  + Ptyxis can run the ptyxis-agent inside the sandbox if we fail
    to run on the host. That comes with drawbacks but at least
    keeps the application working in those scenarios.
  + The build system supports some whitebox renaming allowing it to
    be called "Terminal" in some situations. Distributions shipping
    Ptyxis as their terminal may be encouraged to use that.
    Branding is also reduced to less dramatic styling.
  + Many fixes for Podman, Toolbox, and Distrobox.
  + Fallback to `sh` if we cannot locate the shell specified in
    /etc/passwd.
  + Improvements to the tab parking lot so that processes are
    properly exited.
  + Notification improvements.
  + Port Ptyxis to use the new VTE "termprops" feature. This
    requires a newer VTE than is currently released but is
    anticipated shortly. This reduces the number of patches
    required by Ptyxis (and eventually Fedora) to a single small
    patch for vte.sh.in.
  + New palettes styles.
  + Many new command line options and improved support for
    combining them.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  9 19:07:37 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 46.6:
  + Use a lower value for CSS provider so inspector CSS changes can
    occur at a higher priority.
  + Drop libc compat mode for x86, this is unnecessary now.
  + Fix login-shell toggle in preferences.
  + Show opacity control if the value is currently < 100%.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  9 20:00:07 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 46.4:
  + Fix clear selection shortcut binding
  + Only allow a single palette to affect window dressing at a
    time, fixing a situation where the last palette selected takes
    precedence.
  + Work around misconfigured /etc/passwd in containers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 11 07:18:57 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

    dialog to help users provide useful information.
  + Patches for `vte.sh` are updated to match changes I made for
    Fedora 40 which properly support PROMPT_COMMAND as a bash
    array.
  + Patches for a11y are updated to apply against vte-0-76 branch.
  + Ensure tabs are force-quit when timing out in the parking lot.
  + Some build system rework has occurred for Ptyxis to be compiled
    with alternate app-id and/or gschema identifiers.
  + The build system will now enforce specific linked versions of
    GLib, GTK, and libadwaita using min/max version macros.
