Fri Sep  9 14:42:55 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- update to version 22.8.0: 
  * Highlights
    + Python 3.11 is now supported, except for blackd as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as of publishing (#3234)
    + This is the last release that supports running Black on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6 code will continue to be supported until further notice)
    + Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that affect code that was not previously formatted by Black (#3155)
  * Stable style
    + Fix an infinite loop when using # fmt: on/off in the middle of an expression or code block (#3158)
    + Fix incorrect handling of # fmt: skip on colon (:) lines (#3148)
    + Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators (#2874)
  * Preview style
    + Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as this is invalid. This was a bug introduced in version 22.6.0. (#3166)
    + --skip-string-normalization / -S now prevents docstring prefixes from being normalized as expected (#3168)
    + When using --skip-magic-trailing-comma or -C, trailing commas are stripped from subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)
    + Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside parentheses (#3162)
    + Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of implicitly concatenated strings on its own line (#3227)
  * Blackd
    + blackd now supports enabling the preview style via the X-Preview header (#3217)
  * Configuration
    + Black now uses the presence of debug f-strings to detect target version (#3215)
    + Fix misdetection of project root and verbose logging of sources in cases involving --stdin-filename (#3216)
    + Immediate .gitignore files in source directories given on the command line are now also respected, previously only .gitignore files 
      in the project root and automatically discovered directories were respected (#3237)
  * Documentation
    + Recommend using BlackConnect in IntelliJ IDEs (#3150)
  * Integrations
    + Vim plugin: prefix messages with Black: so it's clear they come from Black (#3194)
    + Docker: changed to a /opt/venv installation + added to PATH to be available to non-root users (#3202)
    + Vim plugin: add flag (g:black_preview) to enable/disable the preview style (#3246)
  * Output
    + Change from deprecated asyncio.get_event_loop() to create our event loop which removes DeprecationWarning (#3164)
    + Remove logging from internal blib2to3 library since it regularly emits error logs about failed caching that can and should be ignored (#3193)
  * Parser
    + Type comments are now included in the AST equivalence check consistently so accidental deletion raises an error.
      Though type comments can't be tracked when running on PyPy 3.7 due to standard library limitations. (#2874)
  * Performance
    + Reduce Black's startup time when formatting a single file by 15-30% (#3211)

      fn(*args: *T) -> None) is now supported (#3071)
  * Vim Plugin

      true/on/false/off. (#3025)

- Include change log and docs in package

  * Explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer
    works with versions older than 7.0

    works consistently within any bracket pair, including nested
    structures
  * Reindents docstrings when reindenting code around it
  * Show colored diffs
  * Supports Python 3.8 code, e.g. star expressions in return statements
  * No longer normalizes capital R-string prefixes as those have a
    community-accepted meaning
  * Uses exit code 2 when specified configuration file doesn't exit
  * Works on AWS Lambda
  * Added `--force-exclude` argument
  * Removed deprecated `--py36` option
  * Fixed `--diff` output when EOF is encountered

    Hypothesis and Hypothersmith
  * Implemented experimental and disabled by default long string
    rewrapping hidden under a `--experimental-string-processing`
    flag while it's being worked on; this is an undocumented and
    unsupported feature
  * Vim plugin prefer virtualenv packages over global packages
