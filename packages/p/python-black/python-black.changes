- Include change log and docs in package
- Update to v20.8b1
  * Explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer
    works with versions older than 7.0
- from v20.8b0
  * Re-implemented support for explicit trailing commas: now it
    works consistently within any bracket pair, including nested
    structures
  * Reindents docstrings when reindenting code around it
  * Show colored diffs
  * Supports Python 3.8 code, e.g. star expressions in return statements
  * No longer normalizes capital R-string prefixes as those have a
    community-accepted meaning
  * Uses exit code 2 when specified configuration file doesn't exit
  * Works on AWS Lambda
  * Added `--force-exclude` argument
  * Removed deprecated `--py36` option
  * Fixed `--diff` output when EOF is encountered
  * Fixed `# fmt: off` handling around decorators
  * Fixed unstable formatting with some `# type: ignore` comments
  * Fixed invalid removal on organizing brackets followed by indexing
  * Introduced `black-primer`, a CI tool that allows us to run
    regression tests against existing open source users of Black
  * Introduced property-based fuzzing to our test suite based on
    Hypothesis and Hypothersmith
  * Implemented experimental and disabled by default long string
    rewrapping hidden under a `--experimental-string-processing`
    flag while it's being worked on; this is an undocumented and
    unsupported feature
  * Vim plugin prefer virtualenv packages over global packages

- update to 18.9b0
 * numeric literals are now formatted by Black
 * numeric literals are normalized to include _ separators on Python 3.6+ code
 * added --skip-numeric-underscore-normalization to disable the above behavior
     and leave numeric underscores as they were in the input
 * code with _ in numeric literals is recognized as Python 3.6+
 * most letters in numeric literals are lowercased (e.g., in 1e10, 0x01)
 * hexadecimal digits are always uppercased (e.g. 0xBADC0DE)
 * added blackd, see its documentation for more info
 * adjacent string literals are now correctly split into multiple lines
 * trailing comma is now added to single imports that don't fit on a line
 * cache is now populated when --check is successful for a file which
     speeds up consecutive checks of properly formatted unmodified files
 * whitespace at the beginning of the file is now removed
 * fixed mangling pweave and Spyder IDE special comments
 * fixed unstable formatting when unpacking big tuples
 * fixed parsing of __future__ imports with renames
 * fixed scope of # fmt: off when directly preceding yield and other nodes

 * note: the Vim plugin stopped registering ,= as a default chord
    as it turned out to be a bad idea
