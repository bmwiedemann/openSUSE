-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 19:11:13 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 24.3.0 (bsc#1221530, CVE-2024-21503):
  * Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause
    crashes
  * Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to
    strings. Previous versions of Black would incorrectly format
    the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing
    nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will
    crash on such strings until support for the new f-string syntax
    is implemented.
  * Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line
    would not work as expected
  * Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large
    numbers of leading tab characters. This fixes CVE-2024-21503.
  * Note what happens when `--check` is used with `--quiet`

    the unstable style due to an outstanding crash and proposed
    formatting tweaks (#4198)
  * Black now ignores pyproject.toml that is missing a [tool.black]
    section when discovering project root and configuration.
  * More changes, see upstream CHANGES.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 08:51:18 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 24.1.0:
  * Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions
  * Dummy class and function implementations consisting only of
    `...` are formatted more compactly
  * If an assignment statement is too long, we now prefer
    splitting on the right-hand side
  * Hex codes in Unicode escape sequences are now standardized to
    lowercase
  * Allow empty first lines at the beginning of most blocks
  * Add parentheses around long type annotations
  * Enforce newline after module docstrings
  * Fix incorrect magic trailing comma handling in return types
  * Remove blank lines before class docstrings
  * Wrap multiple context managers in parentheses if combined in
    a single `with` statement
  * Fix bug in line length calculations for power operations
  * Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a
    comment after the last entry
  * When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing
    commas are stripped from subscript expressions with more than
    1 element
  * Add extra blank lines in stubs in a few cases
  * Accept raw strings as docstrings
  * Split long lines in case blocks
  * Stop removing spaces from walrus operators within subscripts
  * Fix incorrect formatting of certain async statements
  * Allow combining `# fmt: skip` with other comments
  * There are already a few improvements in the `--preview`
    style, which are slated for the 2025 stable style. Try them
    out and share your feedback. In the past, the preview
    style has included some features that we were not able to
    stabilize. This year, we're adding a separate `--unstable`
    style for features with known problems. Now, the `--preview`
    style only includes features that we actually expect to make
    it into next year's stable style.
  * Fix comment handling when parenthesising conditional
    expressions
  * Fix bug where spaces were not added around parenthesized
    walruses in subscripts, unlike other binary operators
  * Remove empty lines before docstrings in async functions
  * Address a missing case in the change to allow empty lines at
    the beginning of all blocks, except immediately before a
    docstring
  * For stubs, fix logic to enforce empty line after nested
    classes with bodies
  * Add `--unstable` style, covering preview features that have
    known problems that would block them from going into the
    stable style. Also add the `--enable-unstable-feature`
    flag; for example, use `--enable-unstable-feature
    hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` to apply this
    preview feature throughout 2024, even if a later Black
    release downgrades the feature to unstable
  * Format module docstrings the same as class and function
    docstrings
  * Fix crash when using a walrus in a dictionary
  * Fix unnecessary parentheses when wrapping long dicts
  * Stop normalizing spaces before `# fmt: skip` comments
  * Print warning when configuration in `pyproject.toml` contains
    an invalid key
  * Fix symlink handling, properly ignoring symlinks that point
    outside of root
  * Fix cache mtime logic that resulted in false positive cache
    hits
  * Remove the long-deprecated `--experimental-string-processing`
    flag. This feature can currently be enabled with `--preview
    --enable-unstable- feature string_processing`.
  * Revert the change to run Black's pre-commit integration only
    on specific git hooks (#3940) for better compatibility with
    older versions of pre-commit

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 08:19:30 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 23.12.1:
  * Fixed a bug that included dependencies from the `d` extra by
    default
  * This release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style.
    Most but not all of the changes in `--preview` mode will be
    in the 2024 stable style.
  * Fix bug where `# fmt: off` automatically dedents when used
    with the `--line-ranges` option, even when it is not within
    the specified line range.
  * Fix feature detection for parenthesized context managers
  * Prefer more equal signs before a break when splitting chained
    assignments
  * Standalone form feed characters at the module level are no
    longer removed
  * Additional cases of immediately nested tuples, lists, and
    dictionaries are now indented less
  * Allow empty lines at the beginning of all blocks, except
    immediately before a docstring
  * Fix crash in preview mode when using a short `--line-length`
  * Keep suites consisting of only an ellipsis on their own lines
    if they are not functions or class definitions
  * `--line-ranges` now skips _Black_'s internal stability check
    in `--safe` mode. This avoids a crash on rare inputs that have
    many unformatted same-content lines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 16 17:31:29 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to version 22.8.0:
  * Highlights
    + Python 3.11 is now supported, except for blackd as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as of publishing (#3234)
    + This is the last release that supports running Black on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6 code will continue to be supported until further notice)
    + Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that affect code that was not previously formatted by Black (#3155)
  * Stable style
    + Fix an infinite loop when using # fmt: on/off in the middle of an expression or code block (#3158)
    + Fix incorrect handling of # fmt: skip on colon (:) lines (#3148)
    + Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators (#2874)
  * Preview style
    + Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as this is invalid. This was a bug introduced in version 22.6.0. (#3166)
    + --skip-string-normalization / -S now prevents docstring prefixes from being normalized as expected (#3168)
    + When using --skip-magic-trailing-comma or -C, trailing commas are stripped from subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)
    + Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside parentheses (#3162)
    + Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of implicitly concatenated strings on its own line (#3227)
  * Blackd
    + blackd now supports enabling the preview style via the X-Preview header (#3217)

    + Remove logging from internal blib2to3 library since it regularly emits error logs about failed caching that can and should be ignored (#3193)
  * Parser
    + Type comments are now included in the AST equivalence check consistently so accidental deletion raises an error.
      Though type comments can't be tracked when running on PyPy 3.7 due to standard library limitations. (#2874)

- Fix Python 3.6 for Leap 15.2 and for the upcoming python36 flavor
  in Tumbleweed: Requires python-dataclasses
  gh#openSUSE/python-rpm-macros#66

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 12:19:10 UTC 2020 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Include change log and docs in package
- Update to v20.8b1
  * Explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer
    works with versions older than 7.0
- from v20.8b0
  * Re-implemented support for explicit trailing commas: now it
    works consistently within any bracket pair, including nested
    structures
  * Reindents docstrings when reindenting code around it
  * Show colored diffs
  * Supports Python 3.8 code, e.g. star expressions in return statements
  * No longer normalizes capital R-string prefixes as those have a
    community-accepted meaning
  * Uses exit code 2 when specified configuration file doesn't exit
  * Works on AWS Lambda
  * Added `--force-exclude` argument
  * Removed deprecated `--py36` option
  * Fixed `--diff` output when EOF is encountered
  * Fixed `# fmt: off` handling around decorators
  * Fixed unstable formatting with some `# type: ignore` comments
  * Fixed invalid removal on organizing brackets followed by indexing
  * Introduced `black-primer`, a CI tool that allows us to run
    regression tests against existing open source users of Black
  * Introduced property-based fuzzing to our test suite based on
    Hypothesis and Hypothersmith
  * Implemented experimental and disabled by default long string
    rewrapping hidden under a `--experimental-string-processing`
    flag while it's being worked on; this is an undocumented and
    unsupported feature
  * Vim plugin prefer virtualenv packages over global packages

 * numeric literals are now formatted by Black
 * numeric literals are normalized to include _ separators on Python 3.6+ code
 * added --skip-numeric-underscore-normalization to disable the above behavior
     and leave numeric underscores as they were in the input

 * added blackd, see its documentation for more info
 * adjacent string literals are now correctly split into multiple lines
