  <title>A simple, generic user-registration application for Django</title>
  <description>This is just a simple, portable, generic user-registration application for Django projects. Workflow follows a simple pattern: 
* A user signs up for a new account, which will be inactive by default. 
* An email is sent to the address they used to register, containing an activation link. 
* Once they click the activation link, the account becomes active and they can log in as normal.</description>
