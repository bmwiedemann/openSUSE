   New features:
  * added two-dimensional Gaussian lineshape and model (PR #642; 
    @mpmdean)
  * all built-in models are now registered in lmfit.models.
    lmfit_models; new Model class attribute valid_forms (PR #663; 
    @rayosborn)
  * added a SineModel (PR #676; @lneuhaus)
  * add the run_mcmc_kwargs argument to Minimizer.emcee to pass to 
    the emcee.EnsembleSampler.run_mcmc function (PR #694; @rbnvrw)

- Update to version 1.0.1
  + New features:
    - added thermal distribution model and lineshape (PR #620; @mpmdean)
    - introduced a new argument ``max_nfev`` to uniformly specify the maximum
      number of function evalutions (PR #610)
      **Please note: all other arguments (e.g., ``maxfev``, ``maxiter``, ...)
      will no longer be passed to the underlying solver. A warning will be emitted
      stating that one should use ``max_nfev``.**
    - the attribute ``call_kws`` was added to the ``MinimizerResult`` class and
      contains the keyword arguments that are supplied to the solver in SciPy.
  + Bug fixes:
    - fixes to the ``load`` and ``__setstate__`` methods of the Parameter class
    - fixed failure of ModelResult.dump() due to missing attributes
      (Issue #611, PR #623; @mpmdean)
    - ``guess_from_peak`` function now also works correctly with decreasing
       x-values or when using pandas (PRs #627 and #629; @mpmdean)

      and then the value (Issue #636, PR #637; @arunpersaud)

      (Issue #610; @jkrogager)

      coverage (PRs #619, #631, and #633)
    - removed deprecated ``isParameter`` function and automatic conversion of
      an ``uncertainties`` object (PR #626)
    - inaccurate FWHM calculations were removed from built-in models, others
      labeled as estimates (Issue #616 and PR #630)
    - corrected spelling mistake for the Doniach lineshape and model
      (Issue #634; @rayosborn)
    - removed unsupported/untested code for IPython notebooks in lmfit/ui/*
- from version 1.0.0
  + New features:

    - documentation updates to clarify the use of ``emcee``. (PR #614)
- from version 0.9.15
  + New features, improvements, and bug fixes:
    - move application of parameter bounds to setter instead of getter (PR #587)
    - add support for non-array Jacobian types in least_squares
      (Issue #588, @ezwelty in PR #589)
    - add more information (i.e., acor and acceptance_fraction) about
      emcee fit (@j-zimmermann in PR #593)
    - "name" is now a required positional argument for Parameter class,
      update the magic methods (PR #595)
    - fix nvars count and bound handling in confidence interval
      calculations (Issue #597, PR #598)

    - fix and refactor prob_bunc in confidence interval calculations (PR #604)
    - fix adding Parameters with custom user-defined symbols
      (Issue #607, PR #608; thanks to @gbouvignies for the report)
  + Various:
    - bump requirements to LTS version of SciPy/ NumPy and code clean-up (PR #591)
    - documentation updates (PR #596, and others)
    - improve test coverage and Travis CI updates (PR #595, and others)
    - update pre-commit hooks and configuration in setup.cfg

      constraint expressions (Issue #560; PR #561)
    - make sure all parameters in Model.guess() use prefixes (PRs #567 and #569)
    - use ``inspect.signature`` for PY3 to support wrapped functions
      (Issue #570; PR #576)
    - fix ``result.nfev``` for ``brute`` method when using parallelization
      (Issue #578; PR #579)
