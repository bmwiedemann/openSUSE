Tue Dec 28 19:11:00 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v1.0.3
  **Potentially breaking change:**
  * argument ``x`` is now required for the ``guess`` method of
    Models (Issue #747; PR #748)

    To get reasonable estimates for starting values one should
    always supply both ``x`` and ``y`` values; in some cases it
    would work when only providing ``data`` (i.e., y-values). With
    the change above, ``x`` is now required in the ``guess`` method
    call, so scripts might need to be updated to explicitly supply
    ``x``.
  **Bug fixes/enhancements:**
  * do not overwrite user-specified figure titles in Model.plot()
    functions and allow setting with ``title`` keyword argument (PR
    #711)
  * preserve Parameters subclass in deepcopy (@jenshnielsen; PR
    #719)
  * coerce ``data`` and ``indepdent_vars`` to NumPy array with
    ``dtype=float64`` or ``dtype=complex128`` where applicable
    (Issues #723 and #728)
  * fix collision between parameter names in built-in models and
    user-specified parameters (Issue #710 and PR #732)
  * correct error message in PolynomialModel (@kremeyer; PR #737)
  * improved handling of altered JSON data (Issue #739; PR #740,
    reported by Matthew Giammar)
  * map ``max_nfev`` to ``maxiter`` when using
    ``differential_evolution`` (PR #749, reported by Olivier B.)
  * correct use of noise versus experimental uncertainty in the
    documentation (PR #751, reported by Andrés Zelcer)
  * specify return type of ``eval`` method more precisely and allow
    for plotting of (Complex)ConstantModel by coercing their
    ``float``, ``int``, or ``complex`` return value to a
    ``numpy.ndarray`` (Issue #684 and PR #754)
  * fix ``dho`` (Damped Harmonic Oscillator) lineshape (PR #755;
    @rayosborn)
  * reset ``Minimizer._abort`` to ``False`` before starting a new
    fit (Issue #756 and PR #757; @azelcer)
  * fix typo in ``guess_from_peak2d`` (@ivan-usovl; PR #758)
  **Various:**
  * update asteval dependency to >= 0.9.22 to avoid
    DeprecationWarnings from NumPy v1.20.0 (PR #707)
  * remove incorrectly spelled ``DonaichModel`` and ``donaich``
    lineshape, deprecated in version 1.0.1 (PR #707)
  * remove occurrences of OrderedDict throughout the code; dict is
    order-preserving since Python 3.6 (PR #713)
  * update the contributing instructions (PR #718; @martin-majlis)
  * (again) defer import of matplotlib to when it is needed
    (@zobristnicholas; PR #721)
  * fix description of ``name`` argument in ``Parameters.add``
    (@kristianmeyerr; PR #725)
  * update dependencies, make sure a functional development
    environment is installed on Windows (Issue #712)
  * use ``setuptools_scm`` for version info instead of
    ``versioneer`` (PR #729)
  * transition to using ``f-strings`` (PR #730)
  * mark ``test_manypeaks_speed.py`` as flaky to avoid intermittent
    test failures (repeat up to 5 times; PR #745)
  * update scipy dependency to >= 1.14.0 (PR #751)
  * improvement to output of examples in sphinx-gallery and use
    higher resolution figures (PR #753)
  * remove deprecated functions ``lmfit.printfuncs.report_errors``
    and ``asteval`` argument in ``Parameters`` class (PR #759)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 17 11:46:57 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 1.0.2
