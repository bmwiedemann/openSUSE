Mon Jun  8 07:06:22 UTC 2020 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.0.1
  + New features:
    - added thermal distribution model and lineshape (PR #620; @mpmdean)
    - introduced a new argument ``max_nfev`` to uniformly specify the maximum
      number of function evalutions (PR #610)
      **Please note: all other arguments (e.g., ``maxfev``, ``maxiter``, ...)
      will no longer be passed to the underlying solver. A warning will be emitted
      stating that one should use ``max_nfev``.**
    - the attribute ``call_kws`` was added to the ``MinimizerResult`` class and
      contains the keyword arguments that are supplied to the solver in SciPy.
  + Bug fixes:
    - fixes to the ``load`` and ``__setstate__`` methods of the Parameter class
    - fixed failure of ModelResult.dump() due to missing attributes
      (Issue #611, PR #623; @mpmdean)
    - ``guess_from_peak`` function now also works correctly with decreasing
       x-values or when using pandas (PRs #627 and #629; @mpmdean)
    - the ``Parameter.set()`` method now correctly first updates the boundaries
      and then the value (Issue #636, PR #637; @arunpersaud)
  + Various:
    - fixed typo for the use of expressions in the documentation
      (Issue #610; @jkrogager)
    - removal of PY2-compatibility and unused code and improved test
      coverage (PRs #619, #631, and #633)
    - removed deprecated ``isParameter`` function and automatic conversion of
      an ``uncertainties`` object (PR #626)
    - inaccurate FWHM calculations were removed from built-in models, others
      labeled as estimates (Issue #616 and PR #630)
    - corrected spelling mistake for the Doniach lineshape and model
      (Issue #634; @rayosborn)
    - removed unsupported/untested code for IPython notebooks in lmfit/ui/*
- from version 1.0.0
  + New features:
    - no new features are introduced in 1.0.0.
  + Improvements:
    - support for Python 2 and use of the ``six`` package are removed. (PR #612)
  + Various:
    - documentation updates to clarify the use of ``emcee``. (PR #614)
- from version 0.9.15
  + New features, improvements, and bug fixes:
    - move application of parameter bounds to setter instead of getter (PR #587)
    - add support for non-array Jacobian types in least_squares
      (Issue #588, @ezwelty in PR #589)
    - add more information (i.e., acor and acceptance_fraction) about
      emcee fit (@j-zimmermann in PR #593)
    - "name" is now a required positional argument for Parameter class,
      update the magic methods (PR #595)
    - fix nvars count and bound handling in confidence interval
      calculations (Issue #597, PR #598)
    - support Python 3.8; requires asteval >= 0.9.16 (PR #599)
    - only support emcee version 3 (i.e., no PTSampler anymore) (PR #600)
    - fix and refactor prob_bunc in confidence interval calculations (PR #604)
    - fix adding Parameters with custom user-defined symbols
      (Issue #607, PR #608; thanks to @gbouvignies for the report)
  + Various:
    - bump requirements to LTS version of SciPy/ NumPy and code clean-up (PR #591)
    - documentation updates (PR #596, and others)
    - improve test coverage and Travis CI updates (PR #595, and others)
    - update pre-commit hooks and configuration in setup.cfg
  + To-be deprecated:
    - function Parameter.isParameter and conversion from
      uncertainties.core.Variable to value in _getval (PR #595)
- from version 0.9.14
  + New features:
    - the global optimizers ``shgo`` and ``dual_annealing`` (new in SciPy v1.2)
      are now supported (Issue #527; PRs #545 and #556)
    - ``eval`` method added to the Parameter class (PR #550 by @zobristnicholas)
    - avoid ZeroDivisionError in ``printfuncs.params_html_table``
      (PR #552 by @aaristov and PR #559)
    - add parallelization to ``brute`` method (PR #564, requires SciPy v1.3)
  + Bug fixes:
    - consider only varying parameters when reporting potential issues with calculating
      errorbars (PR #549) and compare ``value`` to both ``min`` and ``max`` (PR #571)
    - guard against division by zero in lineshape functions and ``FWHM``
      and ``height`` expression calculations (PR #545)
    - fix issues with restoring a saved Model (Issue #553; PR #554)
    - always set ``result.method`` for ``emcee`` algorithm (PR #558)
    - more careful adding of parameters to handle out-of-order
      constraint expressions (Issue #560; PR #561)
    - make sure all parameters in Model.guess() use prefixes (PRs #567 and #569)
    - use ``inspect.signature`` for PY3 to support wrapped functions
      (Issue #570; PR #576)
    - fix ``result.nfev``` for ``brute`` method when using parallelization
      (Issue #578; PR #579)
  + Various:
    - remove "missing" in the Model class (replaced by nan_policy) and "drop"
      as option to nan_policy (replaced by omit) deprecated since 0.9 (PR #565).
    - deprecate 'report_errors' in printfuncs.py (PR #571)
