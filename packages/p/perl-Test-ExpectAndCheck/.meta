  <title>Expect/check-style unit testing with object methods</title>
  <description>This package creates objects that assist in writing unit tests with mocked object instances. Each mock instance will expect to receive a given list of method calls. Each method call is checked that it received the right arguments, and will return a prescribed result. At the end of each test, each object is checked to ensure all the expected methods were called.</description>
