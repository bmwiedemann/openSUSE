%description
This package creates objects that assist in writing unit tests with mocked
object instances. Each mock instance will expect to receive a given list of
method calls. Each method call is checked that it received the right
arguments, and will return a prescribed result. At the end of each test,
each object is checked to ensure all the expected methods were called.
