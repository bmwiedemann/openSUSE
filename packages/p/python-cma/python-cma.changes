- Update to 4.0.0:
  * majorly improved mixed-integer handling based on a more concise lower
    bound of variances and on so-called integer centering
  * moved options and parameters code into a new file
  * many small-ish fixes and improvements
  * fix compatibility to numpy 2.0 (thanks to Sait Cakmak)
  * improved interface to noise_handler argument which accepts True as value
  * improved interface to ScaleCoordinates now also with lower and upper
    value mapping to [0, 1], see issue #210
  * changed: 'ftarget' triggers with <= instead of <
  * assign surrogate attribute (for the record) when calling fmin_lq_surr
  * various (minor) bug fixes
  * various (small) improvements of the plots and their usability
  * display iterations, evaluations and population size and termination
    criteria in the plots
  * subtract any recorded x from the plotted x-values by x_opt=index
  * plots are now versus iteration number instead of evaluations by default
  * provide legacy bbobbenchmarks without downloading
  * new: CMADataLogger.zip allows sharing plotting data more easily by a
    zip file
  * new: tolxstagnation termination condition for when the incumbent
    seems stuck
  * new: collect restart terminations in cma.evalution_strategy.all_stoppings
  * new: stall_sigma_change_on_divergence_iterations option to stall sigma
    change when the median fitness is worsening
  * new: limit active C update for integer variables
  * new: provide a COCO single function
- Remove upper bound on numpy.
- Update URL.
