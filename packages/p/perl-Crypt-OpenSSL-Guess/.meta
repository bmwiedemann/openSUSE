  <title>Guess OpenSSL include path</title>
  <description>Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess provides helpers to guess OpenSSL include path on any platforms.

Often MacOS's homebrew OpenSSL cause a problem on installation due to include path is not added. Some CPAN module provides to modify include path with configure-args, but Carton or Module::CPANfile is not supported to pass configure-args to each modules. Crypt::OpenSSL::* modules should use it on your Makefile.PL.

This module resolves the include path by Net::SSLeay's workaround. Original code is taken from 'inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm' by Net::SSLeay.
