%description
** If you are unfamiliar with testing *read Test::Tutorial first!* **

This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests
suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits. If you wish to do more
complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement for
this one).
