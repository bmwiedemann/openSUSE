%description
sphinxcontrib-fulltoc is an extension for the Sphinx_ documentation
system that changes the HTML output to include a more detailed table
of contents in the sidebar. By default Sphinx only shows the local
headers for the current page. With the extension installed, all of the
page titles are included, and the local headers for the current page
are also included in the appropriate place within the document.
