  <title>Flexibly parse strings and turn them into DateTime objects</title>
  <description>If you have ever had to use a program that made you type in the date a certain
way and thought &quot;Why can't the computer just figure out what date I wanted?&quot;,
this module is for you.

DateTime::Format::Flexible attempts to take any string you give it and parse it
into a DateTime object.
