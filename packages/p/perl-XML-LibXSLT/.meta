  <title>XML::LibXSLT Perl Module</title>
  <description>This module is a fast XSLT library, based on the GNOME libxslt engine
that you can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/.

The performance is currently about twice that of XML::Sablotron (based
on XSLTMark tests converted to Perl). The libxslt processor is also
highly standard compliant, with practically all of XSLT 1.0 being
supported in version 0.9 of libxslt.</description>
