    <comment>- Update to 3.1:
  Oscar 3.1 is compatible with Django 2.2, Django 3.1 and Django
  3.2 and Python versions 3.6 to 3.9. Support for Django 3.0 has
  been dropped.
  - Improvements have been made to the dashboard interface for
    creating and editing offers, vouchers, and voucher sets.
  - These better expose the flexible implementation of offer and
    voucher functionality, allowing:
    - creation of offers of all types
    - creation of vouchers with multiple offers
    - creation of voucher sets of all usages, and with multiple
      offers
  Details can be found in the full release notes on
  https://django-oscar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releases/v3.1.html
- Skip plenty of failing tests (gh#django-oscar/django-oscar#3883).
