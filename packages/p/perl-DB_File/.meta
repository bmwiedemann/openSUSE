  <title>perl-DB_File - Perl5 access to Berkeley DB version 1.x</title>
  <description>DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by Berkeley DB version 1.x (if you have a newer version of DB, see Using DB_File with Berkeley DB version 2 or greater). It is assumed that you have a copy of the Berkeley DB manual pages at hand when reading this documentation. The interface defined here mirrors the Berkeley DB interface closely.
