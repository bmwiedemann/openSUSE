%description
Cachey tries to hold on to values that have the following characteristics

1. Expensive to recompute (in seconds)
2. Cheap to store (in bytes)
3. Frequently used
4. Recenty used

It accomplishes this by adding the following to each items score on each access

    score += compute_time / num_bytes * (1 + eps) ** tick_time

For some small value of epsilon (which determines the memory halflife). This
has units of inverse bandwidth, has exponential decay of old results and
roughly linear amplification of repeated results.
