%description
SIP is a collection of tools that makes it very easy to create Python
bindings for C and C++ libraries. It was originally developed in 1998
to create PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used
to create bindings for any C or C++ library. For example it is also used
to generate wxPython, the Python bindings for wxWidgets.
