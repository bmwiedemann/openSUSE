  <title>Family of Perl modules to streamline writing Nagios compatible plugins</title>
  <description>Monitoring::Plugin and its associated Monitoring::Plugin::* modules are a
family of perl modules to streamline writing Monitoring plugins. The main
end user modules are Monitoring::Plugin, providing an object-oriented
interface to the entire Monitoring::Plugin::* collection, and
Monitoring::Plugin::Functions, providing a simpler functional interface to
a useful subset of the available functionality.

The purpose of the collection is to make it as simple as possible for
developers to create plugins that conform the Monitoring Plugin guidelines
(https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html).
