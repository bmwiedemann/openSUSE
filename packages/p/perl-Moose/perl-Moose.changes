    [BUG FIXES]
  
    - When an attribute was specified as 'rw' and you also provided an accessor
      name matching the attribute and there was an explicit writer, Moose would
      try to make an additional reader access with the same name as the
      attribute. Then Moose would warn about overwriting an accessor with a
      reader. This is related to the bugs reported in RT #120040.

    - When an attribute defines two methods (say a reader and writer) with the
      same name, this now generates a warning.
  
    - The warning when attribute methods overwrite one another is now much more
      informative. It includes the type of accessors involve (reader, writer,

    - The core overloading support interacted badly with
      MooseX::MarkAsMethods. If you used MooseX::MarkAsMethods in a role that
      provided overloading, then that overloading would not be properly applied
      to consuming classes, leading to very weird errors of the form:
  
          Can't resolve method "???" overloading """" in package "Class2" ...
  
      Note that the problems that MooseX::MarkAsMethods fixes are no longer
      present if you are using Moose 2.1400+ and namespace::autoclean 0.16+. We
      encourage you to upgrade both of these modules and remove

      (because they got them from some other role, for example), this caused an
      error, but it shouldn't. GH #4. (rjbs)
    - Similarly, when a role consumes another role, conflicts in overloading
      operators are now silently resolved in favor of the consuming role, just
      as they are with methods. Note that conflicts between the fallback setting
      for roles are still an error.
  
  2.1300   2014-08-11 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
    - Moose now has core support for overloading in roles. When a role with
      overloading is applied to classes or other roles, the overloading settings
      are transferred to the consumer. Conflicts between roles are treated much
      like method conflicts. This obviates the need for
      MooseX::Role::WithOverloading. If you are using
      MooseX::Role::WithOverloading, upgrade to version 0.15+ and it will simply
      become a no-op when used with this version of Moose.
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - The overloading info methods for roles and classes no longer treat
      "fallback" as an overloaded op. Instead, there are new
      get_overload_fallback_value() and set_overload_fallback_value() methods to
      deal with this explicitly. This is arguably a bug fix.
  
  2.1213   2014-09-25
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
     - closed a memory leak in Moose exception objects where captured stack
       trace frames would contain circular references to the exception objects
       themselves (Graham Knop, PR#81)
  
  2.1212   2014-09-19
  
    [TEST FIXES]
  
    - fix tests that fail on altered warning messages in perl 5.21.4 (RT#98987)
  
  2.1211   2014-08-11
  
    [DOCUMENTATION]
  
    - Updated Changes and Moose::Manual::Delta to note when we started removing
      lazy_build from docs. Also added a note in the Moose::Meta::Attribute docs
      stating that use of this feature is discouraged.
    - Added a pointer from the auto_deref feature to
      Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native. This is often a better choice.
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - The subs installed by Moose::Exporter->setup_import_methods are now named
      using Sub::Name (Dave Rolsky, RT#97572)
  
  2.1210   2014-07-03
  
    [DOCUMENTATION]
  
    - Clarify that Moose::Exception exists for internal usage and that user
      code is better off using the Throwable role or Throwable::Error superclass.
    - Moose::Manual::Support policy clarified regarding legacy Perl versions
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - tests have been removed for an alpha branch of Test::Builder that will
      never see the light of day (Exodist)
  
  2.1209   2014-06-04
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - The is_anon method now always returns false when called on
      Moose::Meta::Role::Composite objects. This isn't strictly right, but for
      the purposes of Moose internals, where "is_anon" really means "needs to be
      cleaned up", it's correct. This fixes warnings that were seen when using
      recent Moose (2.1100+) and MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles as part of a
      composite role. These warnings only appear with Perl 5.16 and earlier.
  
  2.1208   2014-06-01
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    - fix implementation of throw_exception in internal Class::MOP traits,
      caused by changes in 2.1207 (ether, RT#96112)
  
  2.1207   2014-05-26
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - Fixed Specio support to work with the latest Specio (0.10). This version of
      Specio no longer uses Moose internally.
    - exceptions in Class::MOP no longer use Moose::Util, instead using their
      own private implementation of throw_exception, to avoid needless premature
      loading of Moose logic.
  
  2.1206   2014-05-14
  
    [BUG FIXES]
  
    - exceptions should not throw other exceptions; fixes cases where exceptions
      were reporting the wrong error (Upasana, RT#92818 and RT#94795)
  
    [OTHER]
  
    - prereqs needed strictly for building with Dist::Zilla have been moved from
      develop requires to develop recommends, to simplify automated testing on
      older perls that cannot install all Dist::Zilla components
    - removed instances of metaobjects in exception classes where they're not
      really required

- remove outdated perl-Moose-apply_role.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 14 08:13:41 UTC 2014 - mcaj@suse.com

updated to 2.1204 
  - bump minimum prereq needed for optional test using MooseX::NonMoose (which
    broke with new Module::Runtime, see 2.1203), so users can install Moose
    and pass tests before updating MooseX::NonMoose.
  - bump prereq on Module::Runtime to properly detect when a module fails to
    load, and fix how we call these subs (Zefram, RT#92770, RT#86394, RT#92791)
  - string comparisons are now possible with Moose exceptions (RT#92232)
  - re-release to index pod files (Moose::Cookbook::*, Moose::Manual::* etc).
  - Releasing 2.1108 as stable (last stable release was 2.1005).
  - fixed distribution manifest
  - minor documentation and metadata updates
  - many additions to the list of conflicting modules (those that require
    updates after installing Moose), reflecting recent API changes
  - now failing early at build time, with a useful error message, if a
    compiler is not available
  - throw_error import cleaned from Moose::Object after use (doy)
  - resolved new circular load issue between Moose::Util and Class::MOP (Kent
    Fredric, RT#89713 and PR#42)
  - legacy throw_error now takes multiple arguments, like confess does
    (Karen Etheridge)
  - Class::MOP::Object::_inline_throw_error is back, used by some MooseX
    modules (Upasana)
  - fix errors in last trial release relating to Moose::Error::Default,
    Moose::Util::throw_error (Upasana)
  - die if a role to consume can't be found -- this restores behaviour as in
    2.1005 (doy)
  - fix test to accomodate Devel::PartialDump possibly not being installed
    (Upasana)
  - Moose string exceptions have been replaced by Moose::Exception objects. See
    Moose::Manual::Delta for details.
  - Class::MOP::load_class, Class::MOP::is_class_loaded, and
    Class::MOP::load_first_existing_class are now deprecated. See
    Moose::Manual::Delta for details.
  - The non-arrayref forms of enum and duck_type have been deprecated. See
    Moose::Manual::Delta for details.
  - Many deprecated features have now been removed:
    - optimize_as for type constraints
    - the "default is" and "default default" features for native delegations
    - setting coerce => 1 on an attribute whose type constraint has no coercion
    - the public version of Moose::Meta::Method::Destructor::initialize_body
  - Creating classes with Moose now always sets the appropriate entry in %INC,
    even if it wasn't loaded from a file. This should make writing classes
    inline easier, and will allow us to be more intelligent about figuring out
    when classes are loaded in the future. See Moose::Manual::Delta for more
    details. Note that this is slightly backwards-incompatible in some edge
    cases.
  - Moose now uses Module::Runtime instead of Class::Load to load classes. This
    means that there are no more issues with the weird heuristics that
    Class::Load does to determine if a class was previously loaded (inheriting
    from an empty package is now possible, for instance). See
    Moose::Manual::Delta for more details. This is also slightly
    backwards-incompatible in some edge cases.
  - add_method now accepts blessed subs (Graham Knop, PR#28)
  - If a role consumed another role, we resolve method conflicts just like a
    class consuming a role, but when metaclass compat tried to fix up
    metaclass roles, we were putting all methods into one composite role and
    allowing methods in the metaclass roles to conflict. Now we resolve them
    as we should. (Jesse Luehrs, PR#27)
  - Some edge cases in tests with base.pm and non-existent module files are
    handled more strictly (see also perl RT#118561) (Graham Knop, PR#25)
  - 2.1003 was released with some bad metadata, which caused the prereq test
    to fail.
  - Releasing 2.0901 as stable.
  - The with_immutable() sub from Test::Moose now passes a boolean value to
    the code block containing tests indicating whether or not the classes have
    been made immutable. This can make for nicer test descriptions. (Dave
    Rolsky)
  - You can now use Specio types instead of Moose builtins or
    MooseX::Types. As a bonus, Specio types inline coercion. However, this
    support is still experimental (as is Specio), so use it with care. (Dave
    Rolsky)
  - Fixed the Num builtin type to reject NaN, Inf, numbers with whitespace,
    and other questionable strings. The MooseX::Types::LaxNum distro
    implements the old behavior. RT#70539 (Upasana)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Ensure that the Moose::Exporter-generated init_meta returns the same value
    that it did previously. This isn't really a bug, since the return value has
    never been tested or documented, but since the generated init_meta is
    nothing more than a compatibility shim at this point, there's no reason to
    not make it as compatible as possible. Reported by Moritz Onken. (doy)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix init_meta order when multiple also packages are specified (this matters
    when one of them is being used to actually initalize the metaclass,
    typically with also => 'Moose'). Reported by Randy Stauner. (doy)

    initialized through a lazy default or builder
- changes from 2.0302:
  * make make_immutable return value consistent and document it to be true
- changes from 2.0301:
  * a custom error class caused a warning when the class that used it was made
    immutable
  * the enum type will now allow single value enumerations; previously, two or
    more values were required
- changes from 2.0300:
  * the optimize_as option for type constraints has been deprecated; use the
    inline_as option to provide inlining code instead
  * methods to introspect a class's methods will now return methods defined in
    UNIVERSAL (isa, can, etc.); this also means that you can wrap these
    methods with method modifiers; RT#69839
  * the ->parent and ->parents method for a union now return the nearest common
    ancestor of that union's component types; see Moose::Manual::Delta for more
    details
  * the ->parents method used to return an arrayref for union types, and a
    list of one or more types for all other types; now they all return
    lists
  * the ->is_subtype_of and ->is_a_type_of methods have changed their behavior
    for union types: previously, they returned true if any of their member
    types returned true for a given type; now, all of the member types must
    return true; RT#67731
  * the Moose::Exporter module now has a "meta_lookup" option when creating an
    importer: allows you to specify an alternate method for determining the
    metaclass of a caller; this is useful for modules like
    MooseX::Role::Parameterized which generate new metaclasses on the fly
  * added a Moose::Meta::Method->is_stub method
  * a subtype of a union type did not return the right results when you called
    ->is_subtype_of or ->is_a_type_of on it; RT#70322
  * an attribute accessor or delegation method can overwrite a stub method and
    this will no longer throw an error; RT#69988
  * the error generated by unfulfilled method requirements during role
    composition now mentions how to work around imported methods not being
    recognized RT#60583
  * class_type and role_type will now throw errors if you attempt to use them
    to override existing types, just like type and subtype have always done
  * implicitly creating class or role types by using them as the 'isa' or
    'does' parameter to attribute construction will now register the type; this
    means that it cannot later be redefined as something else
  * $class_type->is_subtype_of no longer returns true if passed the name of the
    class that the class type represents when the class type wasn't registered
  * removing anonymous metaclasses prematurely no longer prevents reaping of
    the associated stash
  * the Class::MOP::load_class and Class::MOP::is_class_loaded subroutines are
    no longer documented, and will cause a deprecation warning in the future;
    Moose now uses Class::Load to provide this functionality, and you should as

  * Applying multiple role objects (rather than role names) at once no longer

  * Caching of anon classes now works more sanely in the presence of role
    application parameters - alias and excludes options are taken into account,

- update to 1.23:
  * when reinitializing meta objects for classes and roles, we failed to
    preserve roles and role applications; this led to weird bugs: many MooseX
    modules end up reinitializing your class or role

- changes from 1.20:
  * the role attribute metaclass did not inherit from Class::MOP::Object,
    which could cause errors when trying to resolve metaclass compatibility
    issues
  * the lazy_build feature was accidentally removed all the docs; now it's
    listed in Moose.pm again

- changes from 1.18:
  * type constraint objects now have an assert_coerce method which will either
    return a valid value or throw an error
  * we now warn when an accessor for one attribute overwrites an accessor for
    another attribute; RT #57510
  * the native Array and Hash delegation methods now coerce individual new
    members if the _member type_ has a coercion; in other words, if the array
    reference is defined as an ArrayRef[DateTime], and you've defined a
    coercion from Int to DateTime, then pushing an integer via a delegation
    method will coerce the integer to a DateTime object; RT #62351
  * an attribute using native delegations did not always properly coerce and
    type check a lazily set default value
  * using a regexp to define delegations for a class which was not yet loaded
    did not actually work, but did not explicitly fail; however, it caused an
    error when the class was loaded later; RT#60596
  * attempting to delegate to a class or role which is not yet loaded will now
    throw an explicit error
  * attempting to set lazy_build in an inherited attribute was ignored;
    RT#62057

- changes from 1.17:
  * make native delegation inlining work with instance metaclasses where slot
    access is an do {} block, like Kioku; this fixes the use of native
    delegations together with Kioku

- changes from 1.15:
  * almost every native delegation method which changes the attribute value
    now has an explicitly documented return value; in general, this return
    value matches what Perl would return for the same operation
  * passing an odd number of args to ->new() now gives a more useful warning
    than Perl's builtin warning
  * allow disabling stack traces by setting an environment variable; see
    Moose::Error::Default for details -- this feature is considered
    experimental, and may change in a future release
  * the deprecation warning for using alias and excludes without a leading
    dash now tells you the role being applied and what it was being applied
    to
  * a number of native trait methods which expected strings as arguments did
    not allow the empty string; this included Array->join, String->match,
    String->replace, and String->substr; RT#61962
  * 'no Moose' no longer inadvertently removes imports it didn't create
    itself; RT #60013
  * roles now support passing an array reference of method names to method
    modifier sugar functions
  * native traits no longer use optimized inlining routines if the instance
    requests it (in particular, if inline_get_slot_value doesn't return
    something that can be assigned to)
  * we now ignore all Class::MOP and Moose classes when determining what
    package called a deprecated feature; this should make the deprecation
    warnings saner, and make it possible to turn them off more easily
  * the deprecated "default is" warning no longer happens if the attribute has
    any accessor method defined (accessor, reader, writer); also, this warning
    only happens when a method that was generated because of the "default is"
    gets called, rather than when the attribute is defined
  * the "default default" code for some native delegations no longer issues a
    deprecation warning when the attribute is required or has a builder
  * setting a "default default" caused a fatal error if you used the builder
    or lazy_build options for the attribute; RT#59613

  * A few native traits (String, Counter, Bool) provide default values of "is"
    and "default" when you created an attribute. Allowing them to provide
    these values is now deprecated. Supply the value yourself when creating
    the attribute.
  * New option 'trait_aliases' for Moose::Exporter, which will allow you to
    generate non-global aliases for your traits (and allow your users to
    rename the aliases, etc). (doy)
  * 'use Moose' and 'use Moose::Role' now accept a '-meta_name' option, to
    determine which name to install the 'meta' name under. Passing 'undef'
    to this option will suppress generation of the meta method entirely. (doy)
  * Moose now warns if it overwrites an existing method named "meta" in your

    + mro::get_linear_isa was being called as a function rather than a method, which caused problems with Perl 5.8.x.
    + union types always created a type constraint, even if their constituent constraints did not have any coercions. This bogus coercion always returned undef, which meant that a union which included Undef as a member always coerced bad values to undef. RT #58411
    + union types with coercions would always fall back to coercing the value to undef (unintentionally). Now if all the coercions for a union type fail, the value returned by the coercion is the original value that we attempted to coerce
