%description
Provides a central location for modules to report monitoring metrics, such
as counters of the number of times interesting events have happened, and
programs to collect up and send those metrics to monitoring services.

Inspired by Log::Any, this module splits the overall problem into two
sides. Modules wishing to provide metrics for monitoring purposes can use
the 'use Metrics::Any' statement to obtain a _collector_ into which they
can report metric events. By default this collector doesn't actually do
anything, so modules can easily use it without adding extra specific
dependencies for specific reporting.

A program using one or more such modules can apply a different policy and
request a particular _adapter_ implementation in order to actually report
these metrics to some external system, by using the 'use
Metrics::Any::Adapter' statement.

This separation of concerns allows module authors to write code which will
report metrics without needing to care about the exact mechanism of that
reporting (as well as to write code which does not itself depend on the
code required to perform that reporting).
