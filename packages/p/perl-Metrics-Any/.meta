  <title>perl-Metrics-Any - Abstract collection of monitoring metrics</title>
  <description>Provides a central location for modules to report monitoring metrics, such as counters of the number of times interesting events have happened, and programs to collect up and send those metrics to monitoring services.

Inspired by Log::Any, this module splits the overall problem into two sides. Modules wishing to provide metrics for monitoring purposes can use the 'use Metrics::Any' statement to obtain a _collector_ into which they can report metric events. By default this collector doesn't actually do anything, so modules can easily use it without adding extra specific
dependencies for specific reporting.

A program using one or more such modules can apply a different policy and request a particular _adapter_ implementation in order to actually report these metrics to some external system, by using the 'use
Metrics::Any::Adapter' statement.

This separation of concerns allows module authors to write code which will report metrics without needing to care about the exact mechanism of that reporting (as well as to write code which does not itself depend on the code required to perform that reporting).</description>
