%description
CLI Helpers is a Python package for performing common tasks when
building command-line apps. It's a helper library for command-line interfaces.

Libraries like Click <http://click.pocoo.org/5/> and Python Prompt
Toolkit <https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> are
tools that help to create quality apps. CLI Helpers complements these
libraries by wrapping up common tasks in interfaces.

CLI Helpers is not focused on applications' design patterns or
frameworks -- it can be used it on its own or in combination with
other libraries.
