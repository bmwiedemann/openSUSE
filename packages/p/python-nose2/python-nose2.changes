- update to 0.15.1:
  * Fix a bug with config loading which caused custom ini configs
    not to load if they were not named with a .cfg extension.
    Thanks :user:`grhwalls` for the bug report!
  * Official support for python3.13 betas. nose2 now tests itself
    against Python 3.13.

  * nose2 now supports loading configuration data from the
    tool.nose2 table in pyproject.toml. Thanks to :user:`qequ`
    for the PR! (:pr:`596`, :pr:`606`) On python 3.11+, tomllib
    is used to parse TOML data. On python 3.10 and lower, tomli
    must be installed to enable TOML support. Simply pip install
    tomli as necessary.

- update to 0.14.2:
  * For the coverage plugin, add a config option, coverage-
    combine, which defaults to False. When set, this config
    invokes a coverage combine step before reporting results,
    regardless of whether or not multiprocessing was used to run
    tests. This allows reporting of coverage results via the
    plugin on testsuites which invoke subprocesses.

Fri Feb  9 21:43:46 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.14.1:
  * Fix the reporting of skipped tests in verbose mode on newer
    pythons (3.12.1+), in which a skipped test is no longer
    treated as "started". nose2 will not introduce a
    StartTestEvent in such cases -- the fix is narrowly and
    adjustment to the test reporter.

- drop support-python312.patch (upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 05:39:22 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.14.0;
  * Add official support for python3.12
  * Remove support for python3.6 and python3.7
  * Remove support for python2 and older python3 versions
  * Fix support for python3.12 to avoid warnings about addDuration.
  * nose2 package metadata is converted to pyproject.toml format, using
    setuptools.
  * nose2 license metadata has been corrected in format and content to be
    distributed in the sdist and wheel distributions correctly.
- Add patch support-python312.patch:
  * Support changes made upstream in Python 3.12.1.
- Switch to autosetup macro.
- Instruct pip it isn't allowed to reach PyPi and teach it where to look for
  wheels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 21 12:28:30 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add sle15_python_module_pythons (jsc#PED-68)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 22:42:43 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Make calling of %{sle15modernpython} optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 11:46:12 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 0.12.0
  * Note: The 0.12.x series will be the final releases of nose2
    which support Python 2.
  * Passing --junit-xml-path now implies --junit-xml when using the
    junitxml plugin. This means that the --junit-xml flag can be
    omitted when --junit-xml-path is specified. (:issue:`521`)
  * Remove the dependency on coverage. Use of the coverage plugin
    now requires that you either install coverage independently, or
    use the extra, nose2[coverage_plugin]. As a result, nose2 no
    longer has any strict dependencies
  * Remove the dependency on six, instead using a vendored copy.
    This ensures that the dependency for nose2 doesn't conflict
    with application dependencies
  * nose2 no longer provides an entry-point named based on the
    current python version, e.g. nose2-3.8 on python3.8 . Only the
    nose2 command is provided.
  * Remove support for setup.py test on nose2 itself. This usage is
    deprecated by setuptools. Developers contributing to nose2 are
    encouraged to use tox to run nose2's testsuite, per the
    contributing guide.
- Release 0.11.0
  * Test classes now have their short description (first line of
    docstring) printed in verbose output
  * The junitxml plugin now sets timestamp on each testcase node as
    an ISO-8601 timestamp. Thanks to :user:`deeplow` for the
    contribution!
  * Drop support for Python 3.5
  * Python 3.10 is now officially supported. Python 3.11-dev will
    be supported on a best-effort basis. Thanks to :user:`hugovk`
    and :user:`tirkarthi` for their contributions!
  * Add support for test classes when running with the
    multiprocessing plugin. Thanks to :user:`ltfish` for the
    initial contribution and :user:`stefanholek` for the refinement
    to this change!
- Release 0.10.0
  * Support for subtests!
  * Notes for plugin authors about subtest support:
    - Subtest failures will produce a TestOutcomeEvent with outcome
      = "subtest"
    - Subtest events can be failures, but they do not indicate
      success -- the containing test will send a success event if
      no subtests fail
  * Drop support for Python 3.4
  * Python 3.8 and 3.9 are now officially supported
  * Improve helptext for the multiprocess plugin's -N option
  * When run with reduced verbosity (e.g. with -q), nose2 will no
    longer print an empty line before test reports
  * The plugin registry will no longer contain duplicate plugins
    and or base event.Plugin instances
  * Fix function test case implementation of id, __str__, and
    __repr__. This removes the injected transplant_class.<locals>
    from reporting output
  * Doctest loading will now skip setup.py files in the project
    root
  * Class methods decorated (e.g. with mock.patch) are no longer
    incorrectly picked up by the function loader
- Drop patches
  * remove_unittest2.patch
  * ignore-warnings-doctests.patch
  * fix-mock-dep.patch

 * Dropped support for distutils.
 * Result reporter respects failure status set by other plugins
