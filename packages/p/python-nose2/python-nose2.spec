%description
nose2 is a new version of the nose unit testing framework,
supporting Python 2.6+ and 3.x, but not 2.4.
nose2 does not need a custom importer anymore and instead imports
modules with __import__. nose2 does not support all of the
test project layouts that nose did, and also does not
support package-level fixtures. Almost all configuration for nose2
is to be done through config files, not command-line options.
