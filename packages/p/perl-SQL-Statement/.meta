  <title>SQL parsing and processing engine</title>
  <description>The SQL::Statement module implements a pure Perl SQL parsing and execution
engine. While it by no means implements full ANSI standard, it does support
many features including column and table aliases, built-in and user-defined
functions, implicit and explicit joins, complex nested search conditions,
and other features.

SQL::Statement is a small embeddable Database Management System (DBMS).
This means that it provides all of the services of a simple DBMS except
that instead of a persistent storage mechanism, it has two things: 1) an
in-memory storage mechanism that allows you to prepare, execute, and fetch
from SQL statements using temporary tables and 2) a set of software sockets
where any author can plug in any storage mechanism.

There are three main uses for SQL::Statement. One or another (hopefully not
all) may be irrelevant for your needs: 1) to access and manipulate data in
CSV, XML, and other formats 2) to build your own DBD for a new data source
3) to parse and examine the structure of SQL statements.</description>
