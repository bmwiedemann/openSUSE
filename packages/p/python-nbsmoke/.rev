    <comment>- Update to 0.4.1
  * Don't completely fail to import if beautifulsoup4 and requests
    are unavailable (only the &quot;verify&quot; functionality requires them;
    beautifulsoup4 and requests are supposed to be optional
    dependencies).
- Update to 0.4.0
  * The dependencies for the &quot;verify&quot; command are now optional;
    pip users wanting this feature will need to add the &quot;verify&quot;
    extra (pip install nbsmoke[verify] or pip install nbsmoke[all]),
    or add the dependencies manually (pip install requests
    beautifulsoup4).
  * The dependency for holoviews magics lint checking (i.e.
    holoviews) is now optional; pip users wanting this feature will
    need to add the &quot;holoviews-magics&quot; extra (pip install
    nbsmoke[holoviews-magics] or pip install nbsmoke[all]), or add
    the dependency manually (pip install holoviews).
  * Bug fix: Avoid importing holoviews if available when nbsmoke is
    imported (#36). Previously, the mere presence of nbsmoke in an
    environment could affect test coverage measurement for projects
    that holoviews itself imports.
- Update to 0.3.0
  * support for flake messages to ignore (by regex)
  * support for magics blacklist (i.e. magics that if present cause a flake)
  * added support for script &amp; capture cell magics (mainly as a demo)
  * increased the number of builtin magics that will be silently
    ignored (as they don't interact with the python process), e.g.
    bookmark, edit, who, etc
  * lint failures can be set to be warnings only (potentially
    useful for systems that report warnings
- Drop python2 support due to dependencies dropping python2
