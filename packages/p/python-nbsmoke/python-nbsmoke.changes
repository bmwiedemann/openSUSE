Fri Jan  3 01:26:01 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 0.4.1
  * Don't completely fail to import if beautifulsoup4 and requests
    are unavailable (only the "verify" functionality requires them;
    beautifulsoup4 and requests are supposed to be optional
    dependencies).
- Update to 0.4.0
  * The dependencies for the "verify" command are now optional;
    pip users wanting this feature will need to add the "verify"
    extra (pip install nbsmoke[verify] or pip install nbsmoke[all]),
    or add the dependencies manually (pip install requests
    beautifulsoup4).
  * The dependency for holoviews magics lint checking (i.e.
    holoviews) is now optional; pip users wanting this feature will
    need to add the "holoviews-magics" extra (pip install
    nbsmoke[holoviews-magics] or pip install nbsmoke[all]), or add
    the dependency manually (pip install holoviews).
  * Bug fix: Avoid importing holoviews if available when nbsmoke is
    imported (#36). Previously, the mere presence of nbsmoke in an
    environment could affect test coverage measurement for projects
    that holoviews itself imports.
- Update to 0.3.0
  * support for flake messages to ignore (by regex)
  * support for magics blacklist (i.e. magics that if present cause a flake)
  * added support for script & capture cell magics (mainly as a demo)
  * increased the number of builtin magics that will be silently
    ignored (as they don't interact with the python process), e.g.
    bookmark, edit, who, etc
  * lint failures can be set to be warnings only (potentially
    useful for systems that report warnings
- Drop python2 support due to dependencies dropping python2

- jupyter_client renamed to jupyter-client

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 20:01:24 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 0.2.8
  * Shorter lint tracebacks
  * Added --nbsmoke-lint-onlywarn: Report lint failures as warnings
  * Added --nbsmoke-lint-debug: Allow easier investigation (and debugging) of lint failures. nbsmoke lint currently uses nbconvert to convert ipynb to py, then runs pyflakes on that. You can now see the py source that was actually flake checked (pyflakes-reported line numbers correspond to this source). (Note: unhandled magics e.g. from holoviews can cause spurious flakes. I have separate changes that attempt to improve the situation. Meanwhile, this option is also helpful for debugging that situation.)
  * Only supporting html storage in python 3.
