  <title>Object-Oriented HTTP framework</title>
  <description>CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented HTTP framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they
would build any other object-oriented Python program. This usually results in
smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than three years old and it is has proven very fast and
stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the simplest ones
to the most demanding ones.

Oh, and most importantly: CherryPy is fun to work with :-)</description>
