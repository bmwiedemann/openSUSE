- update to 1.2.0:
  - Improved extension handling:
  - Several new extensions are now supported, both for Fido2Client
    and WindowsClient.
  - Extension APIs have been redesigned, and old APIs have been
    deprecated, slated for
  - removal in version 2.0.
    - Disable hmac-secret extension by default, preferring prf.
  - Improved (de-)serialization of dataclasses to/from
    JSON-friendly dicts.
  - Fido2Client:
    - Support allowCredentials/excludeCredentials of arbitrary
      length.
    - Handle PUAT_REQUIRED by re-attempting with PIN/UV.
  - Allow localhost (and subdomains) to use http:// in RP ID
    verification by default.
  - NFC: Support for Authenticators that return SW=61XX on SELECT.
  - USB: Improve connection recovery and use more specific
    exceptions for errors.
  - Fix: Handle residentKey=preferred properly.
  - Fix: Handle Authentictors that do not pass extensions in
    GetInfo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  7 16:26:39 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.3:
  * Fix USB HID issue on MacOS that sometimes caused a pause
    while waiting for a timeout.
  * Fix argument to CredProp extension where an enum value
    was required instead of also allowing a string.
  * Fix parsing of some key types (ES384, ES512) causing
    signature verification to fail.
  * Deprecation: Calling websafe_decode with a bytes argument
    instead of str.
    This will raise a TypeError in the next major version of
    the library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 15:40:01 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.2:

    authenticatorSelection.

Mon Dec  5 09:06:02 UTC 2022 - Torsten Gruner <simmphonie@opensuse.org>

- drop python-fido2-no-mock.patch
- Update to version 1.1.0
  * Bugfix: Fix name of "crossOrigin" in CollectedClientData.create().
  * Bugfix: Some incorrect type hints in the MDS3 classes were fixed.
  * Stricter checking of dataclass field types.
  * Add support for JSON-serialization of WebAuthn data classes.
    This changes the objects dict representation to align with new additions in the
    WebAuthn specification. As this may break compatibility, the new behavior
    requires explicit opt-in until python-fido2 2.0 is released.
  * Update server example to use JSON serialization.
  * Server: Add support for passing RegistrationResponse/AuthenticationResponse (or
    their deserialized JSON data) to register_complete/authenticate_complete.
  * Add new "hybrid" AuthenticatorTransport.
  * Add new AuthenticatorData flags, and use 2-letter names as in the WebAuthn spec
    (long names are still available as aliases).

- version 1.0.0
  * Release Candidate 1 of first stable release.
  * Require Python 3.7 or later.
  * APIs have updated to align with WebAuthn level 2.
  * Several CTAP 2.1 features have been implemented.
