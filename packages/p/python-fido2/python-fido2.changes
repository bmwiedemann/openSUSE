Mon Dec  5 09:06:02 UTC 2022 - Torsten Gruner <simmphonie@opensuse.org>

- drop python-fido2-no-mock.patch
- Update to version 1.1.0
  * Bugfix: Fix name of "crossOrigin" in CollectedClientData.create().
  * Bugfix: Some incorrect type hints in the MDS3 classes were fixed.
  * Stricter checking of dataclass field types.
  * Add support for JSON-serialization of WebAuthn data classes.
    This changes the objects dict representation to align with new additions in the
    WebAuthn specification. As this may break compatibility, the new behavior
    requires explicit opt-in until python-fido2 2.0 is released.
  * Update server example to use JSON serialization.
  * Server: Add support for passing RegistrationResponse/AuthenticationResponse (or
    their deserialized JSON data) to register_complete/authenticate_complete.
  * Add new "hybrid" AuthenticatorTransport.
  * Add new AuthenticatorData flags, and use 2-letter names as in the WebAuthn spec
    (long names are still available as aliases).

- version 1.0.0
  * Release Candidate 1 of first stable release.
  * Require Python 3.7 or later.
  * APIs have updated to align with WebAuthn level 2.
  * Several CTAP 2.1 features have been implemented.
