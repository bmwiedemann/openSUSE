Fri Feb 10 10:34:43 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.1:
  * Bugfix: "tests" and "docs" in the sdist should be includes,
    not packages, so that they do not get put in site-packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 10 16:08:50 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to v2.0.0 
  * BREAKING: Drop Python 3.5 and 3.6 support.
  * BREAKING: On connect, if the server supports STARTTLS, automatically try to upgrade the connection.
    STARTTLS after connect can be turned on or off explicitly by passing start_tls=True or start_tls=False respectively.
  * BREAKING: Remove deprecated loop keyword argument for the SMTP class.
  * Change: The source_address argument now takes a (addr, port) tuple that is passed as the local_addr param to asyncio.create_connection,
    allowing for binding to a specific IP. The new local_hostname argument that takes the value to be sent to the server with the EHLO/HELO message.
    This behaviour more closely matches smtplib.
  * In order to not break existing usage, passing a string instead of a tuple to source_address will give a DeprecationWarning,
    and use the value as it if had been passed for local_hostname.
  * Thanks @rafaelrds and @davidmcnabnz for raising and contributing work on this issue.
  * Bugfix: the mail_options and rcpt_options arguments to the send coroutine no longer cause errors
  * Cleanup: Refactored SMTP parent classes to remove complex inheritance structure.
  * Cleanup: Switched to asyncio.run for sync client methods.
  * Cleanup: Don't use private email.message.Message policy attribute (instead, set an appropriate policy based on message class)

- Update to v1.1.7
  * Security: Fix a possible injection vulnerability (a variant of https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/python-smtplib-multiple-crlf-injection/)
  * Note that in order to exploit this vulnerability in aiosmtplib, the attacker would need control of the hostname or source_address parameters.
    Thanks Sam Sanoop @ Snyk for bringing this to my attention.
  * Bugfix: include CHANGLOG in sdist release
  * Type hints: fix type hints for async context exit (credit @JelleZijlstra)
