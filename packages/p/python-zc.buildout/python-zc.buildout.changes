- Remove superfluous devel dependency for noarch package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 17 19:55:23 UTC 2018 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.12.2:
 - Upon an error, buildout exits with a non-zero exit code. This now also works
   when running with ``-D``.
 - Fixed most 'Deprecation' and 'Resource' warnings.
- update to version 2.12.1:
 - zc.buildout now explicitly requests zc.recipe.egg >=2.0.6 now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  7 08:43:13 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.12.0:
 - Add a new buildout option ``allow-unknown-extras`` to enable
   installing requirements that specify extras that do not exist. This
   needs a corresponding update to zc.recipe.egg. See `issue 457
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/457>`_.
   zc.recipe.egg has been updated to 2.0.6 for this change.
- update to version 2.11.5:
 - Fix for `issue 295 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/295>`_. On
   windows, deletion of temporary egg files is more robust now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 21 06:46:25 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.4:
 - Fix for `issue 451 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/451>`:
   distributions with a version number that normalizes to a shorter version
   number (3.3.0 to 3.3, for instance) can be installed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 12:54:46 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.3:
 - Update to use the new PyPI at https://pypi.org/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 19:17:43 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.2:
 - Fix for the #442 issue: AttributeError on
   ``pkg_resources.SetuptoolsVersion``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  2 19:17:01 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.1:
 - Made upgrade check more robust. When using extensions, the improvement
   introduced in 2.11 could prevent buildout from restarting itself when it
   upgraded setuptools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 21:24:40 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.0:
 - Installed packages are added to the working set immediately. This helps in
   some corner cases that occur when system packages have versions that
   conflict with our specified versions.
- update to verion 2.10.0
 - Setuptools 38.2.0 started supporting wheels. Through setuptools, buildout
   now also supports wheels! You need at least version 38.2.3 to get proper
   namespace support.
   This setuptools change interfered with buildout's recent support for
   buildout.wheel <https://github.com/buildout/buildout.wheel>, resulting in
   a sudden "Wheels are not supported" error message (see issue 435
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/425>). Fixed by making
   setuptools the default, though you can still use the buildout.wheel if you
   want.
- remove test boundary condition from specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 17:20:19 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 2.9.6:
 * Fixed: could not install eggs when sdist file name and package name had different case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 23 21:46:43 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 2.9.5
 * Use HTTPS for PyPI's index.  PyPI redirects HTTP to HTTPS by default
   now so using HTTPS directly avoids the potential for that redirect
   being modified in flight.

Sun Sep 29 13:37:33 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.1
  + distutils scripts: correct order of operations on from ... import
    lines (see https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/134).
  + Add an --allow-site-packges option to bootstrap.py, defaulting to False.
    If the value is false, strip any "site packages" (as defined by the
    site module) from sys.path before attempting to import setuptools / pkg_resources.
  + Updated the URL used to fetch ez_setup.py to the official,
    non-version- pinned version.
- Changes between version 2.2.0 and 2.1.0
  + Handle both addition and subtraction of elements (+= and -=) on
    the same key in the same section. Forward-ported from buildout 1.6.
  + Suppress the useless Link to <URL> ***BLOCKED*** by --allow-hosts error
    message being emitted by distribute / setuptools.
  + Extend distutils script generation to support module docstrings and
   _future__ imports.
  + Refactored picked versions logic to make it easier to use for plugins.
  + Use get_win_launcher API to find Windows launcher (falling back to resource
   _string for cli.exe).
  + Remove data_files from setup.py: it was installing README.txt in current
    directory during installation (merged from 1.x branch).
  + Switch dependency from distribute 0.6.x to setuptools 0.7.x.
- Use download url as source url
- Replace python-distribute with python-setuptools BuildRequires
- Add documentation from tarball

Mon Mar 25 02:20:16 UTC 2013 - alexandre@exatati.com.br

- Update to 2.1.0:
  - Meta-recipe support
  - Conditional sections
  - Buildout now accepts a --version command-line option to print
    its version.
  Fixed: Builout didn't exit with a non-zero exit status if there was a
         failure in combination with an upgrade.
  Fixed: We now fail with an informative error when an old bootstrap
         script causes buildout 2 to be used with setuptools.
  Fixed: An error incorrectly suggested that buildout 2 implemented all
         of the functionality of dumppickedversions.
  Fixed: Buildout generated bad scripts when no eggs needed to be added
         to sys.path.
  Fixed: Buildout didn't honour Unix umask when generating scripts.
         https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/180705
  Fixed: update-versions-file didn't work unless
         show-picked-versions was also set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 21 15:48:40 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com
- Update to version 1.7.1:
  * Fixed: Constraints intended to prevent upgrading to
    buildout-2-compatible recipes weren't expressed correctly, leading to
    unintendional use of zc.recipe.egg-2.0.0a3. 
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  * Unless version requirements are specified, buildout won't upgrade
    itself past version 1.
  * Versions in versions sections can now be simple constraints, like <2.0dev
    in addition to being simple versions.
  * This is used to prevent upgrading zc.recipe.egg and zc.recipe.testrunner
    past version 1.
  * If buildout is bootstrapped with a non-final release, it won't downgrade 
    itself to a final release.
  * Fix: distribute 0.6.33 broke Python 2.4 compatibility
    remove data_files from setup.py, which was installing README.txt in
    current directory during installation [Domen KoÅ¾ar]
    Windows fix: use cli-64.exe/cli.exe depending on 64/32 bit and try cli.exe
    if cli-64.exe is not found, fixing 9c6be7ac6d218f09e33725e07dccc4af74d8cf97
 *  Windows fix: buildout init was broken, re.sub does not like a single backslash
 *  fixed all builds on travis-ci
    use os._exit insted of sys.exit after ugrade forking
