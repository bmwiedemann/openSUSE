-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 27 10:12:16 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- - Change History:
**************
- update to version 2.13.6:
 - Allow to run buildout in FIPS enabled environments
   (`#570 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/570>`_)
- update to version 2.13.5:
 - Improve possible error message if using a too new version of ``setuptools``.
   (`#580 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/580>`_)
- update to version 2.13.4:
 - Pin ``setuptools < 52`` as setuptools removed support for ``easy_install`` in
   newer versions.
   (`#543 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/543>`_)
 - Support for Python 3.4 is no longer tested using automatic tests.
 - Add support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.
- update to version 2.13.3:
 - Fix DeprecationWarning about MutableMapping.
   (`#484 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/484>`_)
- update to version 2.13.2:
 - Fixed DeprecationWarning on python 3.7: "'U' mode is deprecated".
- update to version 2.13.1:
 - Documentation update for the new ``buildout query`` command.
- update to version 2.13.0:
 - Get information about the configuration with new command ``buildout query``.
- update to version 2.12.2:
 - Upon an error, buildout exits with a non-zero exit code. This now also works
   when running with ``-D``.
 - Fixed most 'Deprecation' and 'Resource' warnings.
- update to version 2.12.1:
 - zc.buildout now explicitly requests zc.recipe.egg >=2.0.6 now.
- update to version 2.12.0:
 - Add a new buildout option ``allow-unknown-extras`` to enable
   installing requirements that specify extras that do not exist. This
   needs a corresponding update to zc.recipe.egg. See `issue 457
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/457>`_.
   zc.recipe.egg has been updated to 2.0.6 for this change.
- update to version 2.11.5:
 - Fix for `issue 295 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/295>`_. On
   windows, deletion of temporary egg files is more robust now.
- update to version 2.11.4:
 - Fix for `issue 451 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/451>`_:
   distributions with a version number that normalizes to a shorter version
   number (3.3.0 to 3.3, for instance) can be installed now.
- update to version 2.11.3:
 - Update to use the new PyPI at https://pypi.org/.
- update to version 2.11.2:
 - Fix for the #442 issue: AttributeError on
   ``pkg_resources.SetuptoolsVersion``.
- update to version 2.11.1:
 - Made upgrade check more robust. When using extensions, the improvement
   introduced in 2.11 could prevent buildout from restarting itself when it
   upgraded setuptools.
- update to version 2.11.0:
 - Installed packages are added to the working set immediately. This helps in
   some corner cases that occur when system packages have versions that
   conflict with our specified versions.
- update to version 2.10.0:
 - Setuptools 38.2.0 started supporting wheels. Through setuptools, buildout
   now also supports wheels! You need at least version 38.2.3 to get proper
   namespace support.
   This setuptools change interfered with buildout's recent support for
   `buildout.wheel <https://github.com/buildout/buildout.wheel>`_, resulting in
   a sudden "Wheels are not supported" error message (see `issue 435
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/425>`_). Fixed by making
   setuptools the default, though you can still use the buildout.wheel if you
   want.
- update to version 2.9.6:
 - Fixed: could not install eggs when sdist file name and package name had different
   case.
- update to version 2.9.5:
 - Use HTTPS for PyPI's index.  PyPI redirects HTTP to HTTPS by default
   now so using HTTPS directly avoids the potential for that redirect
   being modified in flight.
- update to version 2.9.4:
 - Sort the distributions used to compute ``__buildout_signature__`` to
   ensure reproducibility under Python 3 or under Python 2 when ``-R``
   is used on ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` is set to ``random``. Fixes `issue 392
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/392>`_.
   **NOTE**: This may cause existing ``.installed.cfg`` to be
   considered outdated and lead to parts being reinstalled spuriously
   under Python 2.
 - Add support code for doctests to be able to easily measure code
   coverage. See `issue 397 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/397>`_.
- update to version 2.9.3:
 - Add more verbosity to ``annotate`` results with ``-v``
 - Select one or more sections with arguments after ``buildout annotate``.
- update to version 2.9.2:
 - Fixed: We unnecessarily used a function from newer versions of
   setuptools that caused problems when older setuptools or pkg_resources
   installs were present (as in travis.ci).
- update to version 2.9.1:
 - Fixed a minor packaging bug that broke the PyPI page.
- update to version 2.9.0:
 - Added new syntax to explicitly declare that a part depends on other part.
   See http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/topics/implicit-parts.html
 - Internal refactoring to work with `buildout.wheel
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout.wheel>`_.
 - Fixed a bugs in ``zc.buildout.testing.Buildout``. It was loading
   user-default configuration.  It didn't support calling the
   ``created`` method on its sections.
 - Fixed a bug (windows, py 3.4)
   When processing metadata on "old-style" distutils scripts, .exe stubs
   appeared in ``metadata_listdir``, in turn reading those burped with
   ``UnicodeDecodeError``. Skipping .exe stubs now.
- update to version 2.8.0:
 - Added a hook to enable a soon-to-be-released buildout extension to
   provide wheel support.
- update to version 2.7.1:
 - Fixed a bug introduced in 2.6.0:
   zc.buildout and its dependeoncies were reported as picked even when
   their versions were fixed in a ``versions`` section.  Worse, when the
   ``update-versions-file`` option was used, the ``versions`` section was
   updated needlessly on every run.
- update to version 2.7.0:
 - Added a buildout option, ``abi-tag-eggs`` that, when true, causes
   the `ABI tag <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/#abi-tag>`_
   for the buildout environment to be added to the eggs directory name.
   This is useful when switching Python implementations (e.g. CPython
   vs PyPI or debug builds vs regular builds), especially when
   environment differences aren't reflected in egg names.  It also has
   the side benefit of making eggs directories smaller, because eggs
   for different Python versions are in different directories.
- update to version 2.6.0:
 - Updated to work with the latest setuptools.
 - Added (verified) Python 3.6 support.
- update to version 2.5.3:
 - After a dist is fetched and put into its final place, compile its
   python files.  No longer wait with compiling until all dists are in
   place.  This is related to the change below about not removing an
   existing egg.  [maurits]
 - Do not remove an existing egg.  When installing an egg to a location
   that already exists, keep the current location (directory or file).
   This can only happen when the location at first did not exist and
   this changed during the buildout run.  We used to remove the
   previous location, but this could cause problems when running two
   buildouts at the same time, when they try to install the same new
   egg.  Fixes #307.  [maurits]
 - In ``zc.buildout.testing.system``, set ``TERM=dumb`` in the environment.
   This avoids invisible control characters popping up in some terminals,
   like ``xterm``.  Note that this may affect tests by buildout recipes.
   [maurits]
 - Removed Python 2.6 and 3.2 support.
   [do3cc]
- update to version 2.5.2:
 - Fixed ``-=`` and ``+=`` when extending sections. See #161.
   [puittenbroek]
- update to version 2.5.1:
 - Fix python 2 for downloading external config files with basic auth in the
   URL. Fixes #257.
- update to version 2.5.0:
 - Added more elaborate version and requirement information when there's a
   version conflict. Previously, you could get a report of a version conflict
   without information about which dependency requested the conflicing
   requirement.
   Now all this information is logged and displayed in case of an error.
   [reinout]
 - Dropped 3.2 support (at least in the automatic tests) as setuptools will
   soon stop supporting it. Added python 3.5 to the automatic tests.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.7:
 - Fix for #279. Distutils script detection previously broke on windows with
   python 3 because it errored on ``.exe`` files.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.6:
 - Relative paths are now also correctly generated for the current directory
   ("develop = .").
   [youngking]
- update to version 2.4.5:
 - More complete fix for #24. Distutils scripts are now also generated for
   develop eggs.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.4:
 - zc.buildout is now also released as a wheel. (Note: buildout itself doesn't
   support installing wheels yet.)
   [graingert]
- update to version 2.4.3:
 - Added nested directory creation support
   [guyzmo]
- update to version 2.4.2:
 - If a downloaded config file in the "extends-cache" gets corrupted, buildout
   now tells you the filename in the cache. Handy for troubleshooting.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.1:
 - Check the ``use-dependency-links`` option earlier.  This can give
   a small speed increase.
   [maurits]
 - When using python 2, urllib2 is used to work around Python issue 24599, which
   affects downloading from behind a proxy.
   [stefano-m]
- update to version 2.4.0:
 - Buildout no longer breaks on packages that contain a file with a non-ascii
   filename. Fixes #89 and #148.
   [reinout]
 - Undo breakage on Windows machines where ``sys.prefix`` can also be a
   ``site-packages`` directory:  don't remove it from ``sys.path``.  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/217 .
 - Remove assumption that ``pkg_resources`` is a module (untrue since
   release of `setuptools 8.3``).  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/227 .
 - Fix for #212. For certain kinds of conflict errors you'd get an UnpackError
   when rendering the error message. Instead of a nicely formatted version
   conflict message.
   [reinout]
 - Making sure we use the correct easy_install when setuptools is installed
   globally. See https://github.com/buildout/buildout/pull/232 and
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/pull/222 .
   [lrowe]
 - Updated buildout's `travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org/buildout/buildout>`_
   configuration so that tests run much quicker so that buildout is easier and
   quicker to develop.
   [reinout]
 - Note: zc.recipe.egg has also been updated to 2.0.2 together with this
   zc.buildout release. Fixed: In ``zc.recipe.egg#custom`` recipe's ``rpath``
   support, don't assume path elements are buildout-relative if they start with
   one of the "special" tokens (e.g., ``$ORIGIN``).  See:
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/225.
   [tseaver]
 - ``download-cache``, ``eggs-directory`` and ``extends-cache`` are now
   automatically created if their parent directory exists. Also they can be
   relative directories (relative to the location of the buildout config file
   that defines them). Also they can now be in the form ``~/subdir``, with the
   usual convention that the ``~`` char means the home directory of the user
   running buildout.
   [lelit]
 - A new boostrap.py file is released (version 2015-07-01).
 - When bootstrapping, the ``develop-eggs/`` directory is first removed. This
   prevents old left-over ``.egg-link`` files from breaking buildout's careful
   package collection mechanism.
   [reinout]
 - The bootstrap script now accepts ``--to-dir``. Setuptools is installed
   there. If already available there, it is reused. This can be used to
   bootstrap buildout without internet access. Similarly, a local
   ``ez_setup.py`` is used when available instead of it being downloaded. You
   need setuptools 14.0 or higher for this functionality.
   [lrowe]
 - The bootstrap script now uses ``--buildout-version`` instead of
   ``--version`` to pick a specific buildout version.
   [reinout]
 - The bootstrap script now accepts ``--version`` which prints the bootstrap
   version. This version is the date the bootstrap.py was last changed. A date
   is handier or less confusing than either tracking zc.buildout's version or
   having a separate bootstrap version number.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.3.1:
 - Fixed: Buildout merged single-version requirements with
   version-range requirements in a way that caused it to think there
   wasn't a single-version requirement.  IOW, buildout throught that
   versions were being picked when they weren't.
 - Suppress spurios (and possibly non-spurious) version-parsing warnings.
- update to version 2.3.0:
 - Buildout is now compatible with (and requires) setuptools 8.
- update to version 2.2.5:
 - Improved fix for #198: when bootstrapping with an extension, buildout was
   too strict on itself, resulting in an inability to upgrade or downgrade its
   own version.
   [reinout]
 - Setuptools must be at 3.3 or higher now. If you use the latest bootstrap
   from http://downloads.buildout.org/2/bootstrap.py you're all set.
   [reinout]
 - Installing *recipes* that themselves have dependencies used to fail with a
   VersionConflict if such a dependency was installed globally with a lower
   version. Buildout now ignores the version conflict in those cases and simply
   installs the correct version.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.2.4:
 - Fix for #198: buildout 2.2.3 caused a version conflict when bootstrapping a
   buildout with a version pinned to an earlier one. Same version conflict
   could occur with system-wide installed packages that were newer than the
   pinned version.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.2.3:
 - Fix #197, Python 3 regression
   [aclark4life]
- update to version 2.2.2:
 - Open files for ``exec()`` in universal newlines mode.  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/130
 - Add ``BUILDOUT_HOME`` as an alternate way to control how the user default
   configuration is found.
 - Close various files when finished writing to them. This avoids
   ResourceWarnings on Python 3, and better supports doctests under PyPy.
 - Introduce improved easy_install Install.install function. This is present
   in 1.5.X and 1.7X but was never merged into 2.X somehow.
- update to version 2.2.1:
 - ``distutils`` scripts: correct order of operations on ``from ... import``
   lines (see https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/134).
 - Add an ``--allow-site-packges`` option to ``bootstrap.py``, defaulting
   to False.  If the value is false, strip any "site packages" (as defined by
   the ``site`` module) from ``sys.path`` before attempting to import
   ``setuptools`` / ``pkg_resources``.
 - Updated the URL used to fetch ``ez_setup.py`` to the official, non-version-
   pinned version.
- update to version 2.2.0:
 - Handle both addition and subtraction of elements (+= and -=) on the same key
   in the same section. Forward-ported from buildout 1.6.
 - Suppress the useless ``Link to <URL> ***BLOCKED*** by --allow-hosts``
   error message being emitted by distribute / setuptools.
 - Extend distutils script generation to support module docstrings and
   __future__ imports.
 - Refactored picked versions logic to make it easier to use for plugins.
 - Use ``get_win_launcher`` API to find Windows launcher (falling back to
   ``resource_string`` for ``cli.exe``).
 - Remove ``data_files`` from ``setup.py``:  it was installing ``README.txt``
   in current directory during installation (merged from 1.x branch).
 - Switch dependency from ``distribute 0.6.x`` to ``setuptools 0.7.x``.
- update to version 2.1.0:
 - Meta-recipe support
 - Conditional sections
 - Buildout now accepts a ``--version`` command-line option to print
   its version.
 - Fixed: Builout didn't exit with a non-zero exit status if there was a:
        failure in combination with an upgrade.
 - Fixed: We now fail with an informative error when an old bootstrap:
        script causes buildout 2 to be used with setuptools.
 - Fixed: An error incorrectly suggested that buildout 2 implemented all:
        of the functionality of dumppickedversions.
 - Fixed: Buildout generated bad scripts when no eggs needed to be added:
        to ``sys.path``.
 - Fixed: Buildout didn't honour Unix umask when generating scripts.:
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/180705
 - Fixed: ``update-versions-file`` didn't work unless:
        ``show-picked-versions`` was also set.
        https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/71
- update to version 2.0.1:
 - Fixed: buildout didn't honor umask settings when creating scripts.
 - Fix for distutils scripts installation on Python 3, related to
   ``__pycache__`` directories.
 - Fixed: encoding data in non-entry-point-based scripts was lost.

 - Removed Python 2.6 and 3.2 support.
   [do3cc]
- update to version 2.5.2:
 - Fixed ``-=`` and ``+=`` when extending sections. See #161.
   [puittenbroek]
- update to version 2.5.1:
 - Fix python 2 for downloading external config files with basic auth in the
   URL. Fixes #257.
- update to version 2.5.0:
 - Added more elaborate version and requirement information when there's a
   version conflict. Previously, you could get a report of a version conflict
   without information about which dependency requested the conflicing
   requirement.
   Now all this information is logged and displayed in case of an error.
   [reinout]
 - Dropped 3.2 support (at least in the automatic tests) as setuptools will
   soon stop supporting it. Added python 3.5 to the automatic tests.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.7:
 - Fix for #279. Distutils script detection previously broke on windows with
   python 3 because it errored on ``.exe`` files.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.6:
 - Relative paths are now also correctly generated for the current directory
   ("develop = .").
   [youngking]
- update to version 2.4.5:
 - More complete fix for #24. Distutils scripts are now also generated for
   develop eggs.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.4:
 - zc.buildout is now also released as a wheel. (Note: buildout itself doesn't
   support installing wheels yet.)
   [graingert]
- update to version 2.4.3:
 - Added nested directory creation support
   [guyzmo]
- update to version 2.4.2:
 - If a downloaded config file in the "extends-cache" gets corrupted, buildout
   now tells you the filename in the cache. Handy for troubleshooting.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.4.1:
 - Check the ``use-dependency-links`` option earlier.  This can give
   a small speed increase.
   [maurits]
 - When using python 2, urllib2 is used to work around Python issue 24599, which
   affects downloading from behind a proxy.
   [stefano-m]
- update to version 2.4.0:
 - Buildout no longer breaks on packages that contain a file with a non-ascii
   filename. Fixes #89 and #148.
   [reinout]
 - Undo breakage on Windows machines where ``sys.prefix`` can also be a
   ``site-packages`` directory:  don't remove it from ``sys.path``.  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/217 .
 - Remove assumption that ``pkg_resources`` is a module (untrue since
   release of `setuptools 8.3``).  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/227 .
 - Fix for #212. For certain kinds of conflict errors you'd get an UnpackError
   when rendering the error message. Instead of a nicely formatted version
   conflict message.
   [reinout]
 - Making sure we use the correct easy_install when setuptools is installed
   globally. See https://github.com/buildout/buildout/pull/232 and
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/pull/222 .
   [lrowe]
 - Updated buildout's `travis-ci <https://travis-ci.org/buildout/buildout>`_
   configuration so that tests run much quicker so that buildout is easier and
   quicker to develop.
   [reinout]
 - Note: zc.recipe.egg has also been updated to 2.0.2 together with this
   zc.buildout release. Fixed: In ``zc.recipe.egg#custom`` recipe's ``rpath``
   support, don't assume path elements are buildout-relative if they start with
   one of the "special" tokens (e.g., ``$ORIGIN``).  See:
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/225.
   [tseaver]
 - ``download-cache``, ``eggs-directory`` and ``extends-cache`` are now
   automatically created if their parent directory exists. Also they can be
   relative directories (relative to the location of the buildout config file
   that defines them). Also they can now be in the form ``~/subdir``, with the
   usual convention that the ``~`` char means the home directory of the user
   running buildout.
   [lelit]
 - A new boostrap.py file is released (version 2015-07-01).
 - When bootstrapping, the ``develop-eggs/`` directory is first removed. This
   prevents old left-over ``.egg-link`` files from breaking buildout's careful
   package collection mechanism.
   [reinout]
 - The bootstrap script now accepts ``--to-dir``. Setuptools is installed
   there. If already available there, it is reused. This can be used to
   bootstrap buildout without internet access. Similarly, a local
   ``ez_setup.py`` is used when available instead of it being downloaded. You
   need setuptools 14.0 or higher for this functionality.
   [lrowe]
 - The bootstrap script now uses ``--buildout-version`` instead of
   ``--version`` to pick a specific buildout version.
   [reinout]
 - The bootstrap script now accepts ``--version`` which prints the bootstrap
   version. This version is the date the bootstrap.py was last changed. A date
   is handier or less confusing than either tracking zc.buildout's version or
   having a separate bootstrap version number.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.3.1:
 - Fixed: Buildout merged single-version requirements with
   version-range requirements in a way that caused it to think there
   wasn't a single-version requirement.  IOW, buildout throught that
   versions were being picked when they weren't.
 - Suppress spurios (and possibly non-spurious) version-parsing warnings.
- update to version 2.3.0:
 - Buildout is now compatible with (and requires) setuptools 8.
- update to version 2.2.5:
 - Improved fix for #198: when bootstrapping with an extension, buildout was
   too strict on itself, resulting in an inability to upgrade or downgrade its
   own version.
   [reinout]
 - Setuptools must be at 3.3 or higher now. If you use the latest bootstrap
   from http://downloads.buildout.org/2/bootstrap.py you're all set.
   [reinout]
 - Installing *recipes* that themselves have dependencies used to fail with a
   VersionConflict if such a dependency was installed globally with a lower
   version. Buildout now ignores the version conflict in those cases and simply
   installs the correct version.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.2.4:
 - Fix for #198: buildout 2.2.3 caused a version conflict when bootstrapping a
   buildout with a version pinned to an earlier one. Same version conflict
   could occur with system-wide installed packages that were newer than the
   pinned version.
   [reinout]
- update to version 2.2.3:
 - Fix #197, Python 3 regression
   [aclark4life]
- update to version 2.2.2:
 - Open files for ``exec()`` in universal newlines mode.  See
   https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/130
 - Add ``BUILDOUT_HOME`` as an alternate way to control how the user default
   configuration is found.
 - Close various files when finished writing to them. This avoids
   ResourceWarnings on Python 3, and better supports doctests under PyPy.
 - Introduce improved easy_install Install.install function. This is present
   in 1.5.X and 1.7X but was never merged into 2.X somehow.
- update to version 2.2.1:
 - ``distutils`` scripts: correct order of operations on ``from ... import``
   lines (see https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/134).
 - Add an ``--allow-site-packges`` option to ``bootstrap.py``, defaulting
   to False.  If the value is false, strip any "site packages" (as defined by
   the ``site`` module) from ``sys.path`` before attempting to import
   ``setuptools`` / ``pkg_resources``.
 - Updated the URL used to fetch ``ez_setup.py`` to the official, non-version-
   pinned version.
- update to version 2.2.0:
 - Handle both addition and subtraction of elements (+= and -=) on the same key
   in the same section. Forward-ported from buildout 1.6.
 - Suppress the useless ``Link to <URL> ***BLOCKED*** by --allow-hosts``
   error message being emitted by distribute / setuptools.
 - Extend distutils script generation to support module docstrings and
   __future__ imports.
 - Refactored picked versions logic to make it easier to use for plugins.
 - Use ``get_win_launcher`` API to find Windows launcher (falling back to
   ``resource_string`` for ``cli.exe``).
 - Remove ``data_files`` from ``setup.py``:  it was installing ``README.txt``
   in current directory during installation (merged from 1.x branch).
 - Switch dependency from ``distribute 0.6.x`` to ``setuptools 0.7.x``.
- update to version 2.1.0:
 - Meta-recipe support
 - Conditional sections
 - Buildout now accepts a ``--version`` command-line option to print
   its version.
 - Fixed: Builout didn't exit with a non-zero exit status if there was a:
        failure in combination with an upgrade.
 - Fixed: We now fail with an informative error when an old bootstrap:
        script causes buildout 2 to be used with setuptools.
 - Fixed: An error incorrectly suggested that buildout 2 implemented all:
        of the functionality of dumppickedversions.
 - Fixed: Buildout generated bad scripts when no eggs needed to be added:
        to ``sys.path``.
 - Fixed: Buildout didn't honour Unix umask when generating scripts.:
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/180705
 - Fixed: ``update-versions-file`` didn't work unless:
        ``show-picked-versions`` was also set.
        https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/71
- update to version 2.0.1:
 - Fixed: buildout didn't honor umask settings when creating scripts.
 - Fix for distutils scripts installation on Python 3, related to
   ``__pycache__`` directories.
 - Fixed: encoding data in non-entry-point-based scripts was lost.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  8 20:56:33 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 2.13.4:
  - Pin `setuptools` < 52 as setuptools removed support for `easy_install` in
    newer versions.
    (`#543 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/543>`_)
  - Support for Python 3.4 is no longer tested using automatic tests.
  - Add support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 17 19:55:23 UTC 2018 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.12.2:
 - Upon an error, buildout exits with a non-zero exit code. This now also works
   when running with ``-D``.
 - Fixed most 'Deprecation' and 'Resource' warnings.
- update to version 2.12.1:
 - zc.buildout now explicitly requests zc.recipe.egg >=2.0.6 now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  7 08:43:13 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.12.0:
 - Add a new buildout option ``allow-unknown-extras`` to enable
   installing requirements that specify extras that do not exist. This
   needs a corresponding update to zc.recipe.egg. See `issue 457
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/457>`_.
   zc.recipe.egg has been updated to 2.0.6 for this change.
- update to version 2.11.5:
 - Fix for `issue 295 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/295>`_. On
   windows, deletion of temporary egg files is more robust now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 21 06:46:25 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.4:
 - Fix for `issue 451 <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/451>`:
   distributions with a version number that normalizes to a shorter version
   number (3.3.0 to 3.3, for instance) can be installed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 12:54:46 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.3:
 - Update to use the new PyPI at https://pypi.org/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 19:17:43 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.2:
 - Fix for the #442 issue: AttributeError on
   ``pkg_resources.SetuptoolsVersion``.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  2 19:17:01 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.1:
 - Made upgrade check more robust. When using extensions, the improvement
   introduced in 2.11 could prevent buildout from restarting itself when it
   upgraded setuptools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 21:24:40 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 2.11.0:
 - Installed packages are added to the working set immediately. This helps in
   some corner cases that occur when system packages have versions that
   conflict with our specified versions.
- update to verion 2.10.0
 - Setuptools 38.2.0 started supporting wheels. Through setuptools, buildout
   now also supports wheels! You need at least version 38.2.3 to get proper
   namespace support.
   This setuptools change interfered with buildout's recent support for
   buildout.wheel <https://github.com/buildout/buildout.wheel>, resulting in
   a sudden "Wheels are not supported" error message (see issue 435
   <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/425>). Fixed by making
   setuptools the default, though you can still use the buildout.wheel if you
   want.
- remove test boundary condition from specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 17:20:19 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 2.9.6:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 23 21:46:43 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 2.9.5
 * Use HTTPS for PyPI's index.  PyPI redirects HTTP to HTTPS by default
   now so using HTTPS directly avoids the potential for that redirect
   being modified in flight.

- Changes between version 2.2.0 and 2.1.0
  + Handle both addition and subtraction of elements (+= and -=) on
    the same key in the same section. Forward-ported from buildout 1.6.
  + Suppress the useless Link to <URL> ***BLOCKED*** by --allow-hosts error
    message being emitted by distribute / setuptools.

Thu Feb 21 15:48:40 UTC 2013 - p.drouand@gmail.com
- Update to version 1.7.1:
  * Fixed: Constraints intended to prevent upgrading to
    buildout-2-compatible recipes weren't expressed correctly, leading to
    unintendional use of zc.recipe.egg-2.0.0a3. 
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  * Unless version requirements are specified, buildout won't upgrade
    itself past version 1.
  * Versions in versions sections can now be simple constraints, like <2.0dev
    in addition to being simple versions.
  * This is used to prevent upgrading zc.recipe.egg and zc.recipe.testrunner
    past version 1.
  * If buildout is bootstrapped with a non-final release, it won't downgrade 
    itself to a final release.
  * Fix: distribute 0.6.33 broke Python 2.4 compatibility
    remove data_files from setup.py, which was installing README.txt in
    current directory during installation [Domen Kožar]
