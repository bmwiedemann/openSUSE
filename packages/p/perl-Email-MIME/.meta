  <title>Easy MIME Message Parsing</title>
  <description>This is an extension of the Email::Simple module, to handle MIME encoded messages. It takes a message as a string, splits it up into its constituent parts, and allows you access to various parts of the message. Headers are decoded from MIME encoding.
