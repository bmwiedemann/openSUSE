  <title>A simple SQL tokenizer</title>
  <description>SQL::Tokenizer is a simple tokenizer for SQL queries. It does not claim to
be a parser or query verifier. It just creates sane tokens from a valid SQL
query.

It supports SQL with comments like:

 -- This query is used to insert a message into
 -- logs table
 INSERT INTO log (application, message) VALUES (?, ?)

Also supports '''', '&quot;&quot;' and '\'' escaping methods, so tokenizing queries
like the one below should not be a problem:

 INSERT INTO log (application, message)
 VALUES ('myapp', 'Hey, this is a ''single quoted string''!')</description>
