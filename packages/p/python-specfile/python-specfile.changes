- Update to version 0.10.0 
  * Fixed an issue that caused empty lines originally inside 
    changelog entries to appear at the end. (#140)
  * Renamed the ignore_missing_includes option to a more general 
    force_parse. If specified, it allows to attempt to parse the 
    spec file even if one or more sources required to be present at 
    parsing time are not available. Such sources include sources 
    referenced from shell expansions in tag values and sources 
    included using the %include directive. (#137)
