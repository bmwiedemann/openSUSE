- Add config.cfg improvements to remove deprecation warnings
  * python-specfile-improve-setup-cfg.patch

- Update to version 0.11.1
  * Tags enclosed in conditional macro expansions are not ignored 
    anymore.
  * Fixed context managers being shared between Specfile instances. 1q

- Update to version 0.11.0 
  * Context managers (Specfile.sections(), Specfile.tags() etc.) can
    now be nested and combined together (with one exception - 
    Specfile.macro_definitions()), and it is also possible to use 
    tag properties (e.g. Specfile.version, Specfile.license) inside 
    them. It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding 
    the with statement, by using the content property 
    (e.g. Specfile.tags().content), but be aware that no 
    modifications done to such data will be preserved. You must use 
    with to make changes.

- Update to version 0.10.0 
  * Fixed an issue that caused empty lines originally inside 
    changelog entries to appear at the end. (#140)
  * Renamed the ignore_missing_includes option to a more general 
    force_parse. If specified, it allows to attempt to parse the 
    spec file even if one or more sources required to be present at 
    parsing time are not available. Such sources include sources 
    referenced from shell expansions in tag values and sources 
    included using the %include directive. (#137)

    EVR, upper bound EVR or both. (#104)
