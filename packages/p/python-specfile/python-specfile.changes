Mon Jun 10 08:54:27 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.29.0:
  * Improved compatibility with RPM 4.20 (alpha version is
    currently in Fedora Rawhide).
  * Fixed several minor issues such as processing seemingly
    commented-out macro definitions (e.g. `#%global prerel rc1`)
    and treating `SourceLicense` tag as a source.
  * Made `EVR`, `NEVR` and `NEVRA` objects comparable.
  * Handling of trailing newlines in the macro defintions has
    been improved.
  * We have fixed an issue in `%prep` section processing. For
    instance, if the `%patches` macro appeared there, it would
    have been converted to `%patch es`, causing failure when
    executing `%prep` later.
  * A trailing newline is no longer added to spec files without
    one upon saving.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 25 08:27:46 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.27.0:
  * Improved handling of commented-out macro definitions and
    fixed related logic in `Specfile.update_value()`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 29 10:17:19 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.26.0:
  * When accessing tags or macro definitions by name, specfile
    now takes validity into account when looking for the best
    match. For example if there are two instances of `Version`
    tag, one in the true and one in the false branch of a
    condition, `Specfile.version` will always access the one that
    is in the true branch. (#328)
  * Third pre-release for testing Packit support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 23 07:47:50 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to 0.25.0:
  - There is a new method, Specfile.update_version(), that allows
    updating spec file version even if it is a pre-release. (#317)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  8 10:08:44 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.24.0:
  - Improved type annotations for UserList subclasses. (#299)
  - Macro definitions gained a new commented_out property
    indicating that a macro definition is commented out. Another
    new property, comment_out_style, determines if it is achieved
    by using a %dnl (discard next line) directive (e.g. %dnl
    %global prerelease beta2) or by replacing the starting % with
    # (e.g. #global prerelease beta2). (#298)
- Fix a bad Requires: %{python_module typing_extensions}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 10:14:03 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to 0.23.0:
  - Sources now have a valid property that indicates whether a
    source is valid in the current context, meaning it is not
    present in a false branch of any condition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 17 07:30:54 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to 0.22.1:
  - Removed dependency on setuptools-scm-git-archive

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  4 10:43:44 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- reduce buildrequires to git-core

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  3 17:13:37 UTC 2023 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Update to 0.22.0:
  - Changes from 0.22.0:
    * Macro definitions and tags gained a new valid attribute. A macro
      definition/tag is considered valid if it doesn't appear in a
      false branch of any condition appearing in the spec file.
  - Changes from 0.21.0:
    * specfile no longer tracebacks when some sources are missing and
      can't be emulated. In such case the spec file is parsed without
      them at the cost of %setup and %patch macros potentially
      expanding differently than with the sources present.
    * Specfile's license in RPM spec file is now confirmed to be SPDX
      compatible.
- Blacklist a new broken test on spec file: test_parse_texlive_spec.
- Add a new Python module dependency: typing_extensions.
- Apply spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 19 04:53:41 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 0.20.0:
  * Fixed infinite loop when removing macros with `%` in the name. (#244)
  * Added a possibility to undefine system macros by setting a macro value
    to `None` in the `macros` argument of the `Specfile` constructor. (#244)
  * Fixed a bug in processing options of `%prep` macros. For instance, when
    a quoted string appeared inside an expression expansion, it could lead
    to improper parsing, rendering the spec file invalid after accessing
    the options. (#253)
  * Parsing has been optimized so that even spec files with hundreds of
    thousands of lines can be processed in reasonable time. (#240)
- Drop setuptools_scm_git_archive BuildRequires.
- Don't need to skip Python 3.8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 09:50:26 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.18.0:
  * Specfile library now handles multiple %changelog sections. (#230)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 11 12:19:01 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.17.0:
  * Added a new guess_packager() function that uses similar
    heuristics as rpmdev-packager, meaning that the
    Specfile.add_changelog_entry() method no longer requires
    rpmdev-packager to guess the changelog entry author. (#220)
  * The Specfile.add_changelog_entry() method now uses dates based
    on UTC instead of the local timezone. (#223)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 25 07:18:46 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.16.0:
  * Added Specfile.has_autorelease property to detect if a spec
    file uses the %autorelease macro. (#221)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 13 12:34:39 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.15.0:
  * Parsing the spec file by RPM is now performed only if really
    necessary, greatly improving performance in certain scenarios.
    (#212)
  * Checked that license is a valid SPDX license.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 25 12:10:44 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.14.0:
  * Fixed a bug that broke parsing in case spec file contained
    conditionalized macro definitions or similar constructs
  * Specfile no longer depends on rpm-py-installer, it now depends
    directly on rpm.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  6 06:32:11 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.13.2:
  * Fixed infinite loop that occured when section options were
    followed by whitespace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 15:38:33 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.13.1:
  * Fixed a bug in section parsing that caused sections to be
    ignored when there were macro definitions spread across the spec
    file and not cumulated at the top.

- Update to version 0.13.0:
  * Added Section.options attribute for convenient manipulation of
    section options.
  * specfile now supports single-line sections where section content
    is represented by a macro starting with a newline.
  * Added evr argument to Specfile.add_changelog_entry(). This
    allows adding a changelog entry with an EVR value that's
    different from the current specfile's value. This makes it
    easier to reconstruct a specfile's %changelog based on another
    source using the higher level interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 10:27:28 UTC 2023 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Remove patch (already upstream):
  * python-specfile-improve-setup-cfg.patch

- Update to version 0.12.0:
  * All classes including `Specfile` itself can now be copied using
    the standard `copy()` and `deepcopy()` functions from `copy`
    module.
  * `Section.name` attribute has been renamed to a more fitting
    `Section.id`.
  * `setup.cfg` now uses `license_files` instead of deprecated
    `license_file`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 08:20:36 UTC 2022 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Add config.cfg improvements to remove deprecation warnings
  * python-specfile-improve-setup-cfg.patch

- Update to version 0.11.1
  * Tags enclosed in conditional macro expansions are not ignored
    anymore.
  * Fixed context managers being shared between Specfile instances.

- Update to version 0.11.0
  * Context managers (Specfile.sections(), Specfile.tags() etc.) can
    now be nested and combined together (with one exception -
    Specfile.macro_definitions()), and it is also possible to use
    tag properties (e.g. Specfile.version, Specfile.license) inside
    them. It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding
    the with statement, by using the content property
    (e.g. Specfile.tags().content), but be aware that no
    modifications done to such data will be preserved. You must use
    with to make changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 17:15:22 UTC 2022 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.10.0
  * Fixed an issue that caused empty lines originally inside
    changelog entries to appear at the end. (#140)
  * Renamed the ignore_missing_includes option to a more general
    force_parse. If specified, it allows to attempt to parse the
    spec file even if one or more sources required to be present at
    parsing time are not available. Such sources include sources
    referenced from shell expansions in tag values and sources
    included using the %include directive. (#137)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 19:02:12 UTC 2022 - Yogalakshmi Arunachalam <yarunachalam@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.9.0
  * Added utility classes for working with (N)EVR. (#113)
  * Fixed an issue with multiple instances of Specfile not expanding macros in the right context. (#117)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 25 09:48:05 UTC 2022 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Update to version v0.8.0
  * Added Specfile.update_tag() method that allows updating tag values while
    trying to preserve macro expansions. You can watch a demo on YouTube.
    (#101)
- 0.7.0
  * It is now possible to filter changelog entries by specifying lower bound
    EVR, upper bound EVR or both. (#104)
  * Added support for filenames specified in source URL fragments, for example:
    https://example.com/foo/1.0/download.cgi#/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz (#100)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 04:08:46 UTC 2022 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Initial spec for v0.6.0
