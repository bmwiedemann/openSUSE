Mon Nov  7 18:46:51 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to v0.9.1
  * support for Python 3.11
- Release v0.9
  * Drop support for Python 3.7.
  * Infrastructure and packaging updates.
  * Made many improvements, bug fixes, and significant speed-ups
    for the adaptive resampling algorithm, reproject_adaptive.
    These bug fixes may cause changes to the reprojected images,
    which are typically negligible.Improvements include the
    addition of a flux-conserving mode, support for a Gaussian
    filter kernel, a menu of boundary-handling modes, and a
    center_jacobian flag to trade speed for accuracy with
    rapidly-varying transformations.
  * Added a roundtrip_coords argument to reproject_adaptive and
    reproject_interp. By default, all coordinate transformations
    are run in both directions to handle some situations where they
    are ambiguous. This can be disabled by setting
    roundtrip_coords=False which may offer a significant speed
    increase.
