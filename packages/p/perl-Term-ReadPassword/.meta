  <title>Term::ReadPassword - Asking the user for a password</title>
  <description>This module lets you ask the user for a password in the traditional
way, from the keyboard, without echoing.

This is not intended for use over the web; user authentication over the
web is another matter entirely. Also, this module should generally be
used in conjunction with Perl's crypt() function, sold separately.</description>
