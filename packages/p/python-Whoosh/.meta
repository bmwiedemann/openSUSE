  <description>Whoosh is a fast, pure-Python indexing and search library. Programmers can use it to easily add search functionality to their applications and websites. Because Whoosh is pure Python, you don't have to compile or install a binary support library and/or make Python work with a JVM, yet Whoosh is still very fast at indexing and searching. Every part of how Whoosh works can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly.</description>
