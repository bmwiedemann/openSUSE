- Remove mypy test requirement. The test calls mypy via its API.
  But mypy as importable module is only available for the default
  python3 flavor. For packaging, we don't need to run the static
  type checker at all.
- Remove mock requirement.

- Replace setup.py test with pytest
- Remove %bcond_without tests

- update to v 4.6.0 (bsc#1172389)
  * Choose blinding factor relatively prime to N. Thanks Christian Heimes for pointing this out.
  * Reject cyphertexts (when decrypting) and signatures (when verifying) that have been modified by prepending zero bytes. This resolves CVE-2020-13757. Thanks Carnil for pointing this out.
  * Rolled back the switch to Poetry, and reverted back to using Pipenv + setup.py for dependency management. There apparently is an issue no-binary installs of packages build with Poetry. This fixes #148
Limited SHA3 support to those Python versions (3.6+) that support it natively. The third-party library that adds support for this to Python 3.5 is a binary package, and thus breaks the pure-Python nature of Python-RSA. This should fix #147.
  * Added support for Python 3.8.
  * Dropped support for Python 2 and 3.4.
  * Added type annotations to the source code. This will make Python-RSA easier to use in your IDE, and allows better type checking.
  * Added static type checking via MyPy.
  * Fix #129 Installing from source gives UnicodeDecodeError.
  * Switched to using Poetry for package management.
  * Choose blinding factor relatively prime to N. Thanks Christian Heimes for pointing this out.
  * Reject cyphertexts (when decrypting) and signatures (when verifying) that
  * have been modified by prepending zero bytes. This resolves CVE-2020-13757.

- fix build on older distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 16 13:51:23 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Update to v 4.0.0
  * Removed deprecated modules:
    + rsa.varblock
    + rsa.bigfile
    + rsa._version133
    + rsa._version200
  * Removed CLI commands that use the VARBLOCK/bigfile format.
  * Ensured that PublicKey.save_pkcs1() and PrivateKey.save_pkcs1() always return bytes.
  * Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.
  * Dropped support for Psyco.
  * Miller-Rabin iterations determined by bitsize of key.
  * Added function `rsa.find_signature_hash()` to return the name of the
    hashing algorithm used to sign a message. `rsa.verify()` now also
    returns that name, instead of always returning `True`.
  * Add support for SHA-224 for PKCS1 signatures.
  * Transitioned from `requirements.txt` to Pipenv for package management.

    completely removed in version 4.0.
  * Add an 'exponent' argument to key.newkeys()
  * Switched from Solovay-Strassen to Miller-Rabin primality testing, to
    comply with NIST FIPS 186-4 as probabilistic primality test
    (Appendix C, subsection C.3):
  * Fixed bugs #12, #14, #27, #30, #49
- Update to Version 3.3
  * Thanks to Filippo Valsorda: Fix BB'06 attack in verify() by
    switching from parsing to comparison.

    coverage package uses a u'' prefix, which was reintroduced in 3.3
    for ease of porting.
