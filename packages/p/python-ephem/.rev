    <comment>- update to 3.7.7.1:
  * Fixed a memory leak in ``readdb()``.
  * Fixed the ``Body.copy()`` method to correctly copy
  object-specific fields across to the new object, like Saturn ring tilt
  and Earth satellite catalog number.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 4.1.1:
  * When you provide PyEphem with a Python ``datetime`` that has a time
  zone attached, PyEphem now detects the time zone and converts the date
  and time to UTC automatically.
  * A new search routine had been written and tested
  to power the :ref:`transit-rising-setting` methods
  ``previous_rising()``,
  ``previous_setting()``,
  ``next_rising()``, and
  ``next_setting()``.
  They should no longer be susceptible to getting hung up in a loop.
  You should also find them substantially faster.
  * Fixed the ``constellation()`` routine so that it uses astrometric,
  rather than apparent, right ascension and declination.  This should
  make it more accurate along the borders of each constellation.
  * Fixed how the underlying “libastro” library computes whether a body’s
  image is deflected by gravity when its light passes close to the Sun.
  Previously, users would see coordinates jump unexpectedly as the
  deflection formula turned on and off haphazardly.
  * Fixed the star positions in the ``ephem.stars`` star catalog by adding
  8.75 years of proper motion to each star.  Previously, each 1991.25
  position from the Hipparcos catalog was being incorrectly treated as a
  2000.0 position.
  * A new routine ``unrefract()`` lets you compute the real altitude
  of a body that you observe in the sky at a given apparent altitude.
  * The old ``cities.lookup()`` function is now officially deprecated.
  Because of a Google API restriction, it stopped working in 2018.
  * Planetary moon positions are now available through the year 2040
  (previously, asking for a position past 2020 returned zeroes).
  * The ``Date`` object is improved such that the return values of</comment>
