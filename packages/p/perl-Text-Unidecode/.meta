  <title>US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text</title>
  <description>
It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but you can't
display it -- usually because you're trying to show it to a user via an
application that doesn't support Unicode, or because the fonts you need aren't
accessible. You could represent the Unicode characters as &quot;???????&quot; or
&quot;\15BA\15A0\1610...&quot;, but that's nearly useless to the user who actually wants
to read what the text says.

What Text::Unidecode provides is a function, unidecode(...) that takes Unicode
data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). The representation is almost
always an attempt at transliteration -- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the
pronunciation expressed by the text in some other writing system. (See the
example in the synopsis.)
