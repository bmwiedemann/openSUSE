- update to version 2.5.0
  + The ffmpeg plugin has been refactored:
    * The core has been moved to a new library: imageio-ffmpeg.
    * That library provides platform-specific wheels that includes ffmpeg,
      so just ``pip install imageio-ffmpeg`` instead of the download step.
    * Note that this new library is py3k only.
    * Termination of ffmpeg subprocess is now more reliable.
    * The reader of the ffmpeg plugin now always reports ``inf`` as the number of
      frames. Use ``reader.count_frames()`` to get the actual number, or estimate
      it from the fps and duration in the meta data.
    * Removed ``CannotReadFrameError``.
  + Other changes:
    * The avbin plugin has been depreacted and will be removed in a future version.
    * Imnproved speed for PIL and FFMPEG plugsins by avoiding memory copies.
    * Update the included tiffile library.
    * Support for SimpleITK.
    * Speed up tiffile plugin when writing to something else than a filename.
    * Fix that writing to a file object would not work for some plugins.
    * Can now pass image data to the write functions as anything that resolves to
      a numpy array with a numeric dtype.
    * One can now read from a memoryview.
    * Fix error related to paletted BMP with the Pillow plugin.
    * Improved logging.
- update to version 2.4.1
