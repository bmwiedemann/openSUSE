  <title>Uses mmap to map in a file as a Perl variable</title>
  <description>The Mmap module uses the POSIX mmap call to map in a file as a Perl variable.
Memory access by mmap may be shared between threads or forked processes, and
may be a disc file that has been mapped into memory. Sys::Mmap depends on your
operating system supporting UNIX or POSIX.1b mmap, of course.
