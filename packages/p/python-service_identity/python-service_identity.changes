- Clean up the SPEC file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  7 14:27:56 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 21.1.0:
  - Python 3.4 is not supported anymore. It has been unsupported
    by the Python core team for a while now, its PyPI downloads
    are negligible, and our CI provider removed it as a supported
    option.
  - It's very unlikely that service-identity will break under 3.4
    anytime soon, which is why we do not block its installation
    on Python 3.4. But we don't test it anymore and will block it
    once someone reports breakage.
  - service_identity.exceptions.VerificationError can now be
    pickled and is overall more well-behaved as an exception.
    This raises the requirement of attrs to 19.1.0.
- This package actually truly requires six (it is expected to
  work with Python 2.7 as well).

Tue Sep 25 11:54:42 UTC 2018 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Drop some SLE11 code that is quite useless today

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 13:16:17 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 17.0.0:
  * Deprecations:
    - Since Chrome 58 and Firefox 48 both don’t accept certificates 
      that contain only a Common Name, its usage is hereby 
      deprecated in service_identity too. We have been raising 
      a warning since 16.0.0 and the support will be removed in 
      mid-2018 for good.
  * Changes:
    - When service_identity.SubjectAltNameWarning is raised, the 
      Common Name of the certificate is now included in the warning
      message. #17
    - Added cryptography.x509 backend for verifying certificates.
      #18
    - Wildcards (*) are now only allowed if they are the leftmost 
      label in a certificate. This is common practice by all major 
      browsers. #19

- Convert to singlespec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  2 16:30:29 UTC 2016 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- Update to 16.0.0:
  * Changes:
    +  Officially support Python 3.5.
    +  service_identity.SubjectAltNameWarning is now raised if the server certicate lacks a proper SubjectAltName. [#9]
    +  Add a __str__ method to VerificationError.
    +  Port from characteristic to its spiritual successor attrs.
  * Backward-incompatible changes:
    +  Python 3.3 and 2.6 aren't supported anymore. They may work by chance but any effort to keep them working has ceased.
    +  pyOpenSSL versions older than 0.14 are not tested anymore. They don't even build with recent OpenSSL versions.
- Update spec file with new upstream package requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 21 12:30:36 UTC 2015 - nemysis@gmx.ch

- Change URL
- Use %{oname} instead of service_identity
- Add BuildRequires for python-Sphinx for Documentation
- Change Description
- Change Documentation add index.html
- Add Man Page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 16 23:49:31 UTC 2015 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- update pkg description to reflect upstream
- rm warnings in description about this pkg being alpha / possibly broken

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 16 23:38:30 UTC 2015 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- alphabetize BuildRequires & Requires
- remove no longer needed commented out test fail workaround

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 16 23:24:49 UTC 2015 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- update to 14.0.0:
  * update spec file with new requirements per instructions by upstream
  * update spec file comment out no longer needed test fail workaround
  * upstream changes:
    + Switch to year-based version numbers.
    + Port to characteristic 14.0 (get rid of deprecation warnings).
    + Package docs with sdist.

-update to 1.0.0:
  * Backward-incompatible changes:
    + Drop support for Python 3.2. There is no justification to add complexity and unnecessary function calls for a Python version that nobody uses.
  * changes:
    + Move into the Python Cryptography Authority’s GitHub account.
    + Move exceptions into service_identity.exceptions so tracebacks don’t contain private module names.
    + Promoting to stable since Twisted 14.0 is optionally depending on service_identity now.
    + Use characteristic instead of a home-grown solution.
    + idna 0.6 did some backward-incompatible fixes that broke Python 3 support. This has been fixed now therefore service_identity only works with idna 0.6 and later. Unfortunately since idna doesn’t offer version introspection, service_identity can’t warn about it.
