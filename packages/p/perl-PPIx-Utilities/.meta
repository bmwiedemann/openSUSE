  <title>Extensions to L&lt;PPI|PPI&gt;.</title>
  <description>This is a collection of functions for dealing with PPI objects, many of
which originated in Perl::Critic. They are organized into modules by the
kind of PPI class they relate to, by replacing the &quot;PPI&quot; at the front of
the module name with &quot;PPIx::Utilities&quot;, e.g. functionality related to
PPI::Nodes is in PPIx::Utilities::Node.</description>
