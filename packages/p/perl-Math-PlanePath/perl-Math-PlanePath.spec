%description
This is a base class for some mathematical paths which map an integer
position '$n' to and from coordinates '$x,$y' in the 2D plane.

The current classes include the following. The intention is that any
'Math::PlanePath::Something' is a PlanePath, and supporting base classes or
related things are further down like 'Math::PlanePath::Base::Xyzzy'.
