  <title>Does your process have access to the web</title>
  <description>This module attempts to answer, as accurately as it can, one of the
nastiest technical questions there is.

*Am I on the internet?*

The answer is useful in a wide range of decisions. For example...

_Should my test scripts run the online portion of the tests or just skip
them?_

_Do I try to fetch fresh data from the server?_

_If my request to the server breaks, is it because I'm offline, or because
the server is offline?_

And so on, and so forth.

But a host of networking and security issues make this problem very
difficult. There are firewalls, proxies (both well behaved and badly
behaved). We might not have DNS. We might not have a network card at all!

You might have network access, but only to a for-money wireless network
that responds to ever HTTP request with a page asking you to enter your
credit card details for paid access. Which means you don't &quot;REALLY&quot; have
access.

The mere nature of the question makes it practically unsolvable.

But with the answer being so useful, and the only other alternative being
to ask the user &quot;duh... are you online?&quot; (when you might not have a user at
all) it's my gut feeling that it is worthwhile at least making an attempt
to solve the problem, if only in a limited way.</description>
