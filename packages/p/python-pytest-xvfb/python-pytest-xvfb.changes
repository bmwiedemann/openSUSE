Tue Dec  9 04:49:32 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.1:
  * Support for Python 3.7 and 3.8 is now dropped, while official support for
    3.12 and 3.13 was added (with no code changes required).
  * pytest.ini (required to run self-tests) is now included in sdists (#39).
  * New pytest_xvfb_disable hook to dynamically disable pytest-xvfb.

Wed Sep 27 10:03:35 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 3.0.0
  * New --xvfb-backend argument, which can be used to run Xephyr or
    Xvnc in place of Xvfb (e.g. for visual inspection but on a
    remote system or a consistent screen size needed).
  * Support for Python 3.5 and 3.6 is now dropped, while official
    support for 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 was added (with no code chances
    required).
  * The Xvfb instance is now no longer saved in pytest's config
    object as config.xvfb anymore, and only available via the xvfb
    fixture.
  * Xvfb is now shut down as late as possible (via an atexit hook
    registered at import time), seemingly avoiding errors such as
    "XIO: fatal IO error 0 (Success)".
  * Code reformatting using black/shed.
  * Packaging refresh using pyproject.toml.
