%description
A pytest plugin to run Xvfb for tests.

With Xvfb and the plugin installed, your testsuite automatically runs
with Xvfb. This allows tests to be run without windows popping up
during GUI tests or on systems without a display (like a CI).

If Xvfb is not installed, the plugin does not run and your tests will
still work as normal. However, a warning message will print to standard
output letting you know that Xvfb is not installed.

If you're currently using xvfb-run in something like .travis.yml,
simply remove it and install this plugin instead - then you'll also have the
benefits of Xvfb locally.
