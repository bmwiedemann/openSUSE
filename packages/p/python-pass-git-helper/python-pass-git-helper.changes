    configuration file. For details, refer to #11. Thanks to
    @somasis for the feature.
  - This version adds more flexibility for selecting the username
    from an entry. Different strategies have been implemented to

    a given regular expression. The readme file explains the
    configuration in detail.
  - The host of a request can now be used as a variable to
    construct a the entry of the password store. This allows
    wildcard entries dispatching to any number of file system
    entries in the password store.
