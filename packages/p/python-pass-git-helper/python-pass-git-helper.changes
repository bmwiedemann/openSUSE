  - don't leak Python exceptions to the user (4415d7e), closes
    #38
  - Adds an encoding configuration per pass entry (fixes #27 +
    #29) and includes some code cleanup (#30).
  - Adds support for the ${username} replacement in the
    configuration file. For details, refer to #11. Thanks to
    @somasis for the feature.
  - This version adds more flexibility for selecting the username
    from an entry. Different strategies have been implemented to
    realize different needs such as searching for a line matching
    a given regular expression. The readme file explains the
    configuration in detail.
  - The host of a request can now be used as a variable to
    construct a the entry of the password store. This allows
    wildcard entries dispatching to any number of file system
    entries in the password store.
