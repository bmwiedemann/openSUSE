  <description>Perl 5 doesn't natively support Java-style interfaces, and it doesn't
support Perl 6 style roles either.
You can get both of these things in half a dozen different ways via
various CPAN modules, but they usually require that you buy into &quot;their
way&quot; of implementing your code.
Other have turned to &quot;duck typing&quot;.
This is, for the most part, a fairly naive check that says &quot;can you do
this method&quot;, under the &quot;if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck,
then it must be a duck&quot;.
