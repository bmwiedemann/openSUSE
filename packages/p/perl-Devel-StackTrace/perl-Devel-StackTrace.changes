  - Added explicit boolean overloading for trace objects. Without this, Perl
    will use the object's string overloading and then check the truthiness of
    the returned string, which is a lot of extra work. This can produce
    significant slowdowns in some cases, as seen in
    https://github.com/plack/Plack/pull/697. Requested by Tatsuhiko
    Miyagawa. GH #23.

  - Add a partial workaround for "Bizarre copy" errors (GH #11) that come when
    attempting to look at arguments in the call stack. This is only a partial
    fix as there are cases that can lead to a SEGV. Ultimately this needs to be
    fixed in the Perl core. See
    https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131046 for relevant
    discussion. Fixed by pali. GH #21.

  - If all frames in the trace were skipped (via skip_frames, frame_filter,
    ignore_*, etc.), then the stringified stack trace would be an empty
    string. Now this has been changed to always return the message given to the
    constructor or the string "Trace begun". Fixes GH #15, reported by Karen
    Etheridge.

  - Fixed the frames method when it is called with arguments. Previously this
    did not work if it was called before the method was called as a
    reader. Fixed by Mark Fowler. PR #8.

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]
  
  - The no_refs constructor parameter is now deprecated, and has been replace by
    a new unsafe_ref_capture parameter that defaults to false, meaning no
    references are captured by default. Capturing references by default caused
    too many issues that couldn't be worked around, including running DESTROY
    blocks multiple times on captured objects in the worst case.
  
  - Removed support for the long-deprecated no_object_refs constructor parameter
    (deprecated in 2002!).

- updated to 1.34
 - Fixed use of // operator (my use, not Graham's) in previous release.
 
 
 1.33   2014-06-26
 
 - Added a skip_frames option. This causes the stack trace to skip an arbitrary
   number of frames. Patch by Graham Knopp. PR #5.
 
 
 1.32   2014-05-05
 
 - Added a filter_frames_early option to filter frames before arguments are
   stringified. Added by Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker. PR #4.

   method in Devel::StackTrace::Frame. Requested by Skef. RT #91575.

Tue Jun  4 08:33:17 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 1.30
 - There was an eval which did not first localize $@ and $SIG{__DIE__}. This
   broke Plack::Middleware::StackTrace (and possibly other tihngs).
 
 - The Devel::StackTrace->frames() method is now read-write. This allows you to
   do more complex filtering of frames than is easily possible with the
   frame_filter argument to the constructor. Patch by David Cantrell.
 
 - Allow arguments to a trace's as_string method, specifically max_arg_length
   Patch by Ricardo Signes.
 
 - Added a no_args option to the constructor in 1.26 but forgot to mention it
   in Changes. Requested by Scott J. Miller. RT #71482.

Wed Jan 19 13:49:08 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- update to version 1.27
  - Skip some tests on 5.13.8+ that are no longer relevant because of a change
    in the Perl core. Reported by Andreas Koenig. RT #64828.
  - The as_string method did not localize $@ and $SIG{__DIE__} before doing an
   eval. Reported and tested by Marc Mims. RT #61072.
  - Moved the frame object to its own file, and renamed it
    Devel::StackTrace::Frame. The old package name, Devel::StackTraceFrame, is
    now a subclass of the new package, to provide a backwards compatibility
    shim.
  - Added message and indent constructor parameters. Based on a patch by James
    Laver. RT #59830.

Mon Mar  8 21:59:06 UTC 2010 - chris@computersalat.de

- update to version 1.22
  - Apparently, overload::StrVal on older Perls (5.8.5, but not 5.8.8)
    tried to call a stringification method if it existed. So now,
    Devel::StackTrace just uses overload::AddrRef instead, which should
    always be safe. Reported by Michael Stevens. Fixes RT #47900.
- 1.21  Jul 1, 2009
  - Overloaded objects which didn't provide a stringification method
    cause Devel::StackTrace to die when respect_overload was
    true. Reported by Laurent Dami. RT #39533.
  - Added a frame_filter option which allows for fine-grained control
    over what frames are included in a trace. Based on (but expanded)
    from a patch proposed by Florian Ragwitz. RT #47415.
