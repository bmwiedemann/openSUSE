<package name="priv_wrapper" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>A library to disable resource limits and other privilege dropping</title>
  <description>priv_wrapper aims to help running processes which are dropping privileges or are
restricting resources in test environments.
It can disable chroot, prctl, pledge and setrlmit system calls. A disabled call always
succeeds (i.e. returns 0) and does nothing.
The system call pledge exists only on OpenBSD.

To use it, set the following environment variables:

LD_PRELOAD=libpriv_wrapper.so
PRIV_WRAPPER_CHROOT_DISABLE=1

This package does not have a devel package, because this project is for
development/testing.
