- update to 0.5.3:
  * NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI was removed from the dtype flags. This should
    improve the speed of array operations, but it does mean
    that values pickled using previous versions of ml_dtypes are
    incompatible with the current release and should be regenerated
    with the current release.
  * Fixed GCC compilation issues related to ambiguous casts.
  * Fixed sign bit handling for float4 and float6 types.
  * Wheels now support Python 3.13 free-threading.
  * Wheels now support the Power architecture.
