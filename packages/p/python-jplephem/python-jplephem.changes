- Update to 2.12

    discovering the function was a recent addition that some user installs
    of NumPy do not support.
- Update to 2.11
  * Reverse the order in which Chebyshev polynomials are computed to
    slightly increase speed, to simplify the code, and in one case

    precision.
- Update to 2.10
  * Document and release support for ``.bcp`` binary PCK kernel files
    through the new ``jplephem.pck`` module.
