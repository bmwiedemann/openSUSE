- update to 2.23:
  * An ephemeris created with the ``excerpt`` command, instead of simply
    copying verbatim the comments area of the original ephemeris, now adds
    text declaring “This is an ephemeris excerpt created by jplephem” and
    recording the dates that the user asked for.
  * The segments of an excerpt ephemeris now advertise exactly the start
    date and end date that the user asked for, even if the underlying
    polynomials cover a wider range of dates.
  * A new ``-v`` (“verbose”) command-line option to the ``spk``
    sub-command prints not only each segment’s descriptor, but the
    dimensions and date range of its underlying polynomial array.

- Update to 2.22
  * No changelog. Notable commit messages:
  * Move julian_day() routine to new calendar module
  * Switch to calendar dates for printing SPK segments
  * Add compute_julian_date() as a user convenience,
  * Various CI updates

- Update to 2.21
  * Tweaked an import to avoid a fatal exception under Python 2, in
    case anyone is still using it.
- Version 2.20
  * Each segment is now protected by a lock, in case two threads
    simultaneously trigger the code that performs the initial load
    of the segment’s data; the symptom was a rare exception
    ``ValueError: cannot reshape array``.
- Version 2.19
  * Fixed a bug in the ``excerpt`` command that was causing it to
    truncate its output when the input ephemeris had more than
    about two dozen segments.  The command’s output should now
    include all matching segments from even a very large ephemeris.
  * Fixed the ``excerpt`` command so the calendar dates specified
    on the command line produce Julian dates ending with the
    fraction ``.5``, which makes excerpt endpoints more exact.
- Version 2.18
  * Added support for big-endian processors, and created a GitHub
    Actions CI build that includes both a big- and a little-endian
    architecture.
- Version 2.17
  * Fixed an ``AttributeError`` in the ``excerpt`` command.
- Version 2.16
  * Fixed a ``ValueError`` raised in the ``excerpt`` command when
    an ephemeris segment needs to be entirely skipped because it
    has no overlap with the user-specified range of dates.
  * Added a ``__version__`` constant to the package’s top level.

- Skip python36 build: With NumPy 1.20, python36-numpy is no
  longer available in Tumbleweed (NEP 29)
- Drop unused test files de405.bsp de421.bsp

Mon Nov 16 14:06:39 UTC 2020 - Marketa Machova <mmachova@suse.com>

- update to 2.15
  * Add "Type N" to each ephemeris segment description
  * Remove a couple of unused imports

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 11:44:52 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 2.14
  * Fall back to plain file I/O on platforms that support
    fileno() but that don’t support mmap(), like the Pyodide
    platform.
- Update to 2.13
  * The exception raised when a segment is given a Julian date
    outside the segment’s date range is now an instance of the
    ValueError subclass OutOfRangeError that reminds the caller
    of the range of dates supported by the SPK segment, and
    carries an array attribute indicating which input dates were
    at fault.

Thu Jan 30 15:00:28 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 2.12
  * Replaced use of NumPy ``flip()`` with a reverse slice ``[::-1]`` after
    discovering the function was a recent addition that some user installs
    of NumPy do not support.
- Update to 2.11
  * Reverse the order in which Chebyshev polynomials are computed to
    slightly increase speed, to simplify the code, and in one case
    (comparing PCK output to NASA) to gain a partial digit of extra
    precision.
- Update to 2.10
  * Document and release support for ``.bcp`` binary PCK kernel files
    through the new ``jplephem.pck`` module.
