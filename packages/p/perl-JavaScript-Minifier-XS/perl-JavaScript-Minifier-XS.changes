     - RT #64948; allow builds on older versions of Perl.
       Thanks to Michael Robinton and Ruslan Zakirov.
     - Lowered minimum Perl version to v5.6.0, as detected by
       Perl::MinimumVersion.
     - RT #51008; allow for minification of JS code that returns regexps from
       functions.
       Thanks to James Barton, Robert Krimen, and Randy Stauner.
     - Added "xt/test-compile.t" to test minification against a wider range of
       JS.  While not a 100% guarantee that the JS still works, it does provide
       a wider range of JS to test against.
