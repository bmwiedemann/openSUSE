  <title>Provide an interface to ZIP archive files</title>
  <description>The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate, read,
and write Zip archive files.

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.

Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members
can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated.
They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other attributes
queried or modified. Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as
needed.

Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
directories, files, or strings.

This module uses the the Compress::Raw::Zlib manpage library to read and
write the compressed streams inside the files.

One can use the Archive::Zip::MemberRead manpage to read the zip file
archive members as if they were files.</description>
