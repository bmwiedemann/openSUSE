<package name="perl-Unicode-Map" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>maps charsets from and to utf16 unicode</title>
  <description>This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format. All
mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8 encoding.
To transform these use Unicode::String.

For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8. Please use
Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for two byte character sets, e.g.
chinese GB2312. Anyway, if you stick to the basic functionality (see
documentation) you can use both modules equivalently.

Practically this module will disappear from earth sooner or later as
Unicode mapping support needs somehow to get into perl's core. If you like
to work on this field please don't hesitate contacting Gisle Aas!

This module can't deal directly with utf8. Use Unicode::String to convert
utf8 to utf16 and vice versa.

Character mapping is according to the data of binary mapfiles in
Unicode::Map hierarchy. Binary mapfiles can also be created with this
module, enabling you to install own specific character sets. Refer to
mkmapfile or file REGISTRY in the Unicode::Map hierarchy.</description>
