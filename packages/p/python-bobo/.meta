  <title>Web application framework for the impatient</title>
  <description>Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications.

It addresses 2 problems:
- Mapping URLs to objects
- Calling objects to generate HTTP responses

Bobo doesn't have a templating language, a database integration layer,
or a number of other features that are better provided by WSGI
middle-ware or application-specific libraries.

Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb.
