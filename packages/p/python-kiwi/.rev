  enabled and gpgcheck parameters has to be set for any
  configured yum repository
  

  
- Fixup repository setup for yum
  
  Yum cannot handle spaces between the key and the value.
  This patch provides a method to tell ConfigParser to use
  no spaces for the '=' delimiter and thus Fixes #357
  

  
- Reactivate warnings report in pytest
  

  
- Fixup kernel name lookup
  
  If multiple abi compatible kernel module packages are installed
  the kernel version of the boot kernel could be different from
  the kernel module versions. In order to find the boot kernel
  all kernel versions found must be checked. Fixes #355</comment>

- Rebuild online schema documentation
  

  
- Bump version: 9.11.0 → 9.11.1
  

  
- Fixed kernelList function
  
  The kernelList function searches for the installed kernels
  and applies the corresponding initrd name. The information the
  method provides is used in case of a custom initrd which should
  be used instead of the result of dracut. When requesting the use
  of the kiwi firsboot initrd also in the system via the
  &lt;oem-kiwi-initrd&gt; element, the information from the list is
  used to correctly link the kiwi initrd named initrd.vmx to the
  expected name of the system as dracut would create it. The
  creation of the list was broken which lead to an empty list
  and the after effect that the system was not able to reboot.
  This Fixes #483

- Delete atftp from SLE15 boot descriptions
  
  atftp will not be part of SLE15 per fate#323633.
  This Fixes #543
  

  
- Fixed blocksize setup in losetup
  
  The -L option was used to set the blocksize value for losetup
  However there is an option name clash between suse util-linux
  and upstream which now leads to the problem that option -L
  has changed its meaning and actually means --nooverlap which
  completely breaks the call in kiwi. This patch changes the
  call to use the long form --logical-blocksize.
  This Fixes bsc#1066873

- Omit kiwi-repart dracut module in oemboot initrd
  
  KIWI's oemboot initrd with initrd_system=&quot;dracut&quot; together with
  installiso=&quot;true&quot; requires to have dracut-kiwi-oem-repart package
  installed in the system, thus it ends up also being included in the
  recreated dracut initrd after booting the oemboot initrd from the
  installation iso. This kiwi-repart module causes a boot failure in that
  case since no .profile file is present, moreover, it has no sense to
  run it at that stage, since the disk is already reparted by the
  oemboot code.
  
  This commit allows installiso=&quot;true&quot; and initrd_system=&quot;dracut&quot; to
  play well together.</comment>

- Fixed kiwi dracut config for the final system
  
  Once the image has been deployed on the target and the
  system is up and running some of the kiwi dracut modules
  used for deployment are no longer needed and should not be
  taken into account when another dracut call happens on the
  system.

- Make sure there are no busy devices on reboot
  
  If the dracut kiwi-repart module skips the repartition step
  because the disk was already repartitioned it leaves devices
  in busy state which leads to a rescue shell at the system
  mount stage

- Update .virtualenv.dev-requirements.txt
  
  sphinx 1.7.0 is not compatible with travis-sphinx
  thus we stick with 1.6.7 until travis-sphinx followed
  the sphinx changes
  

  
- Add restrictions to Path.remove_hierarchy
  
  When an iso file is used as repo, this iso will be loop mounted on
  the host and bind mounted into the image root as long as the image
  builds. When the mount is released a recursive cleanup of the complete
  path happens. This is done by calling Path.remove_hierarchy. However
  if a sub path of the mount path contains a system root directory
  which is mandatory for the Linux root system it is not allowed
  to be deleted even if it is empty at the time of the mount cleanup.
  Thus this patch adds a lookup for protected directory names and
  only runs the recursive deletion as long as no protected member
  is part of the path. This fixes bsc#1080301

- Deleted obsolete boot descriptions
  
  The custom kiwi boot descriptions has been moved into

  dracut module packages provided by kiwi. The classic
  custom boot descriptions can still be used as alternative
  method if the above package is installed. Related to
  Issue #576
  

  
- Create compatible boot options
  
  The boot option root=install:CDLABEL= is mandatory for install
  images which uses the dracut initrd system. But for the custom

- Fixed btrfs search path in earlyboot script
  
  If kiwi generates its own efi image for the boot process
  it does not setup the btrfs relative path setup in the
  earlyboot script embedded into the generated efi image.
  This has a bad impact on the file search because the
  btrfs setup done in kiwi puts root below the @ volume
  which we then need to specify of the relative lookup
  is not activated. Fixes bsc#1082155
  

  
- Bump version: 9.13.3 → 9.13.4
  

  
- Use LABEL for the swap partition
  
  If multipath and device maps are active the fstab entry should use
  the LABEL reference. Systemd calls swapon and it only works properly
  with multipath devices when LABEL reference is used or calling directly
  on the /dev/dm-* device file.

- Delete obsolete hybrid attribute from type
  
  Any iso image we create will be a hybrid image. That was
  already the default for any install iso image and was a
  configuration option for live images. The optional selection
  only existed for systems which do not provide tools to
  make an iso hybrid. All distributions kiwi supports provides
  this capabilities and there is no good reason why a live
  or install iso should not be hybrid and bootable as iso
  and as disk. Also the boot in disk mode became the preferred
  boot method for the majority of our users which requires
  to provide a hybrid iso

- Fix default initrd_system values
  
  This commit fixes the default initrd_system value for some image
  types. Since this value is included in profile and potentially
  taken into account for some of the config script functions, it is
  important to have consistent values even when the image type
  has no initrd choice or it doesn't have initrd at all.

- Fixed detection of disk node in live iso images
  
  If the live iso is booted as disk the initrd code needs to
  find the correct disk node pointing to the iso image. This
  was formerly done by checking if the populated disk devices
  contains an iso header with an application id. The information
  was obtained using the isoinfo tool. isoinfo is a tool</comment>

- Fixed check for volume group in use
  
  The former implementation evaluates the output of the vgs
  command and set the volume group as in use if one of the
  listed volume groups on the host contains the group name
  set by the image description. This would also match if the
  group name set in the image description is e.g 'System' and
  the a volume group on the host with name 'SystemVG' exists.
  However a conflict only exists on exact match of the name.
  The proposed fix is to use the --select feature from vgs
  and let it show information on exact match of the vg_name
  field. The code in kiwi then just evaluates if the selection
  by vgs has a value or not. This Fixes #721
  

  
- Fix setup of kiwi_lvm profile variable
  
  kiwi_lvm was always set to true if a volume management system
  is in use. However it should only be set to true if the
  selected volume management system is lvm. The same applies
  to the kiwi_lvmgroup variable which also only makes sense
  if the lvm volume management system is used.

- Add a chapter for uninstall package requests in docs (#726)
  
  Add a chapter for uninstall package requests in docs
  

  
- Update arm integration test
  
  Existing panda build was outdated and non functional.
  Move the test to a more popular target and write the
  image description to use technology matching the
  suse arm development effort. Target is now Rpi(64bit)
  

  
- Use latest version of sphinx
  
  Formerly sphinx==1.6.7 was used because travis-sphinx failed
  with latest sphinx. Now travis-sphinx fails with 1.6.7 and
  I hope using latest sphinx will fix that

- Fix zypper add lock operations
  
  This commit fixes the arguments passed to zypper in add lock
  operations.
  

  
- Add correct GPL-3.0-or-later license
  
  Add the correct license reference in the spec License field
  
  Fixes #732
  

  
- Make container compression a configuration option
  
  Change the ContainerBuilder class to evaluate on the
  configuration options to decide if the container archive
  should be compressed or not. By default the archive will
  be compressed, thus there is no change to the former behavior
  but can be setup in ~/.config/kiwi/config.yml as follows:

- Fix result bundle command
  
  This commits fixes a regression introduced in 98c9c77a
  

  
- Bump version: 9.16.4 → 9.16.5
  

  
- Fixup validation of boottimeout attribute
  
  If boottimeout is set to zero it is evaluated as &quot;not set&quot;
  and the default applies. However it's a fairly well approach
  to set a zero second boot timeout. This Fixes #789
  

  
- Do not replace version from the image name
  
  This commit makes sure that replacing version to version plus the
  build id on resulting files happens only on version suffixes. Before
  that if image name was including the version string it, this part was
  also replaced.
  
  Fixes #787 (bsc#1102868)</comment>

- Fix use of SysConfig objects
  
  objects of that class did not provide a get method but
  overload the bracket [] operator. Using the get() method
  failed. This Fixes #910
  

  
- Use chkstat to verify and fix file permissions
  
  Call chkstat in system mode which reads /etc/sysconfig/security
  to determine the configured security level and applies the
  appropriate permission definitions from the /etc/permissions*
  files. It's possible to provide those files as overlay files
  in the image description to apply a certain permission setup
  when needed. Otherwise the default setup as provided on the
  package level applies. It's required that the image root system
  has chkstat installed. If not present KIWI skips this step
  and continuous with a warning. This Fixes #895

  With this commit it is possible to set tcp or upd (e.g. &quot;80/tcp&quot;) for
  exposed container ports. If no protocol is provided OCI defaults are</comment>

  If no compression is configured in the kiwi config file
  the default was set to: False. However this lead to big
  trouble on the obs side for images which has fixed
  storage disk sizes configured, e.g Azure images which
  requests 30G disk size per instance. Thus the default
  for the bundler compression has changed to be: True</comment>

- Update the documentation regarding vagrant boxes
  Extend the documentation on how to build VirtualBox vagrant boxes
  All this was done by Dan Čermák &lt;dcermak@suse.com&gt;

- Refactor incremental changelog update
  The creation of the package changelog is based on a reference file.
  However that reference file contained log information in a specific
  timezone which requires to hardcode the region of that timezone
  in the code to correctly run date/time calculations. This can
  be done better from a conceptual point of view. This patch changes
  the handling in a way that the reference file is a git log
  excerpt including the dates as git log lists them. The dates
  contains complete numeric time/date/zone information and can be
  used for calculations. The changelog helper tool converts the
  result data to match the requirements of rpm changelog files
  and prints the time/date information localized to the callers
  timezone or as UTC if the --utc switch is given. By default the
  user local timezone settings applies. That way the setup of
  the local timezone is immaterial to the changelog processor
  and the workaround in the gitlab-ci rpm stage can be deleted
  too.

- Fix derived docker images build
  This commit fixes the derived docker images when the base image is a
  compressed file. After the refactor in #998 the decompression of the
  base image and the skopeo call to import the decompressed image happened
  in absolutely independent scopes. NamedTemporaryFile python class by
  default deletes the created temporary file when the class instance is</comment>

- Update obs docs per review by Tom

- Disable check-valid-until with repository_gpgcheck
  This commit is two fold:
  * From one side fixes a wrong use of the `trusted` option for
  apt repositories. `trusted=no` does not force to run the gpg checks
  it just forces the repository to be considered untrusted regardless
  the result of the security checks.
  * From the other side it disables the option `check-valid-until` in
  case gpg checks are disabled using the `repository_gpgcheck`. It
  works at repository level. This enables using unmaintained or
  expired repositories for the build.
  Fixes #1028

- Simplify shell pipe expression with shell builtin
  Replace &quot;echo $var | sed ...&quot; expression with ${var//SEARCH/REPLACE}
  shell builtin as suggested by Codacy

- Make mediacheck runtime check arch independent
  The check_mediacheck_only_for_x86_arch runtime check fails on
  non x86 architectures but the tagmedia toolchain exists independent
  of the platform architecture. This Fixes #1091

- Set home as protected path
  Along with adding home to the protection list, cleanup
  the prepare instance cleanup code in a way that it only
  runs if a root_bind object exists which needs to call
  its cleanup path</comment>

- Update Boot From Hard Disk method
  Instead of searching for an efi binary to boot, use the exit method
  that exits from grub and let the firmware choose the next entry
  in the device list

- Do not crash on missing HOME

- Added live ISO integration tests for arm

- Consolidate syslinux file names and search paths
  Handle those file names and search path in the Defaults space
  and only once in the code

- Remove '^' which break BaseStripFirmware function (boo#1132455)

- Do not supress output for dracut call
  This commit adds a stderr_to_stdout option to Command.run method to
  redirect stderr to stdout.
  Additionally this commit also includes to the debug log the dracut
  call output, including both, stderr and stdout.
  Fixes #1114

- Fixed path_test unit test
  The code there checked for the message of an exception
  but recent changes in pytest did not allow to do it that
  way anymore.

- Fixed zipl bootloader setup</comment>

- Fixed left over import of six module
  The use of the six compat module was needed to support py2
  With the drop of py2 support all of six was no longer needed.
  However this one was overlooked.

- 99-kiwi-lib requires rmdir, install it
  Fixes bsc#1143033

- Bump version: 9.18.7 → 9.18.8

- Added multiconsole setup to Fedora build test

- Allow multiple values for grub terminal setup
  With regards to the grub documentation from
  https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#terminal_005finput
  multiple terminal consoles can be active. This patch allows
  to specify terminal collection between serial, console and gfxterm
  This Fixes #1123

- Bump version: 9.18.6 → 9.18.7

- Fixed use of Command calls in destructors
  The Command class creates namedtuple to store the result
  of the call. That tuple is created inside of the Command
  namespace. If called inside of a __del__ destructor which
  is often the case in kiwi classes I recently observed an
  exception from python saying:

  This commit makes sure the chrooted operations of over a loop device
  including btrfs subvolumes and root as an snapshot include the
  `/.snapshots` subvolume mount. This is necessary for certain operations
  that depend on the layout, e.g. grub configuration using `grub2-mkconfig`.</comment>

- Fixed swap setup if btrfs is used
  In case of a volume manager the simplified variant of the
  device name is used in the fstab file to reference the
  swap device. However this is only correct for the lvm
  volume management but not for btrfs. In case of btrfs
  the swap space is not a subvolume but a real partition
  and thus the simplified device spec in fstab puts in the
  loop mapped device which is wrong. This patch fixes it

- Exclude 'Recommends: kiwi-man-pages' for EL7 and older in the spec

- Fixed xz options syntax in default kiwi.yml
  xz options are passed as a string and splitted in code
  but not handled as yml list

- Fixed scope of kiwi-man-pages sub package
  The kiwi-man-pages package provided data that belongs to
  the main package, e.g the completion as well as the
  license information. In addition kiwi-man-pages should
  not be a requirement.

- Fixed result map for OEM pxe install
  The result map for OEM images with installpxe enabled
  contained a wrong file name. Thus the result bundler
  was not able to fetch the tarball

  This commit adds a reference to Issue #1301 and the report in bugzilla
  bsc#1159538. The issue was fixed in commit 7d96d19c

- Fix grub2 configuration for shim fallback setup
  If shim fallback setup is enabled the grub.cfg is copied to the EFI
  partition. This commit makes sure that the grub.cfg is copied to the EFI
  partition according to the efi mount point.
  Fixes bsc#1159235

- Ensure no swap volume is added on btrfs
  When the selected filesystem is btrfs the volume manager is not LVM.
  In that case the swap partition is not volume, it is a completely
  independent partition. So that we cannot add and additional volume
  for swap when swap is specified in the description file.
  This patch fixes #1301 and fulfills #1297

- Fixed installation chapter in the documentation
  The chapter still outlines multipython support but we
  dropped support for python2 some time ago</comment>

    <comment>- Bump version: 9.19.9 → 9.19.10

- Follow up fix for kernel version lookup

  When using custom kiwi boot images a shell method named
  baseCreateCommonKernelFile was used to create a common
  kernel file name in the boot image to allow a simpler
  search code in the builder. The search code in the builder
  however uses the standard kernel naming schema and with
  the latest changes to the kernel version lookup the
  common name did not match the matching pattern anymore.
  The use of such a common kernel file is obsolete and
  the shell method can finally be deleted.

- Bump version: 9.19.8 → 9.19.9

- Refactor kernel version lookup

  For the lookup of the kernel version kiwi provided a small
  C program that reads the first bytes of the kernel binary
  and extracts the version information. Given the various
  compression formats and also the problem of kernel files
  that contains the decompressor code which could be anything
  it has turned out to be difficult to provide a stable tool
  to read the version from the binary. Therefore the code in
  kiwi was refactored to read the version via regexp match
  from the filename which also makes kversion an obsolete
  tool. This Fixes #1308</comment>

    <comment>- Bump version: 9.21.22 → 9.21.23

- Move usrmerge package out of the bootstrap section
  Currently bootstrap phase on APT package manager makes use of the
  debootstrap tool. However debootstrap is limited to execute  the
  bootstrap using a single repository. This is causes several limitations
  in OBS builds, such as the impossibility of using update repositories or
  the inclusion of any package that is not part of the standard OBS
  repository.
  Usrmerge package is part of the universe repository in OBS which is not
  te one used by debootstrap, so it can't be installed on bootstrap phase.

- Bump version: 9.21.21 → 9.21.22

- Fixed package manager api inconsistency
  The method post_process_install_requests_bootstrap in the
  zypper package manager was missing an argument

- Bump version: 9.21.20 → 9.21.21

- Fixed regexp for grub rootdev substitution
  The regular expression to match the grub root device
  used a lazy glob match &quot;.*?&quot;. This however matches a
  too long part depending on the rest of the content.
  This commit fixes the expression to be strict on
  the allowed characters and makes sure the anchor
  characters are not part of the matching character
  class. This Fixes #1607

- Fixed dnf plugin config setup
  Only create a dnf plugin config if the plugin config directory
  to store that file exists in the system

- Set --releasever=0 for microdnf
  To allow microdnf to work from an empty root directory
  we need to set the release version to zero

- Use custom varsdir for dnf builds

- Partially revert dcounter.c flaw report
  I could not find a problem with this read call
  it does check on the buffer boundaries and it
  only writes the bytes that read returns until
  read returns &lt;= 0

- Fixed dcounter.c flaw report
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop

- Fixed dcounter.c flaw report
  Variable scope can be reduced and useless value assignment.

- Fixed microdnf support
  The installroot argument must be used together with --config
  and additionally with --noplugins, as well as --setopt for
  cachedir, reposdir and varsdir. Related to #1625

    <comment>- Bump version: 9.22.0 → 9.22.1

- Fixed validation of bool value in dracut module
  The oem-multipath-scan setup results in a bool variable inside
  of the initrd code. The variable kiwi_oemmultipath_scan is
  therefore either set to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. A check in code
  of the form [ -n ... ] is stupid since the variable always
  contains text. This commit fixes the validation to make use
  of the bool() method provided for these type of variables

- Bump version: 9.21.26 → 9.22.0

- Omit multipath module by default
  The plain installation of the multipath toolkit activates the
  dracut multipath code. The setup if the target image runs in a
  multipath environment or not should however be decided explicitly
  in the image description via &lt;oem-multipath-scan&gt; and not
  implicitly by the presence of tools

- Fixed multipath disk device assignment in kiwi lib
  The former lookup of the multipath mapped disk device contained
  a race condition. If the lookup of the device mapper files happened
  before multipathd has finished the initialization, kiwi continues
  with the unix node name and fails when the device mapper keeps
  a busy state on it. This commit changes the code such that in case
  of an explicit request to use multipath the lookup of the mapped
  device becomes a mandatory process that runs until the
  DEVICE_TIMEOUT is reached. Default timeout is set to 60 sec.
  This references Issue SUSE-Enceladus/azure-li-services#255

- Fixed PackageManager decorator in unit test
  Implement patch decorators for factories consistently

- Refactor Repository
  This commit refactors the Repository class and turns it into a
  proper factory class and also includes type hints to facilitate
  it's use from an API POV. Related to #1498

- Add DNF as a proper dependency for openSUSE
  This is required so that OBS can build openSUSE containers and appliances
  using DNF as the package manager.

- Fixed spec file microdnf requirement
  SUSE/SLES doesn't provide microdnf within the official channels yet

- Refactor Partitioner
  This commit refactors the Partitioner class and turns it into a
  proper factory class and also includes type hints to facilitate
  it's use from an API POV. Related to #1498

- Avoid using generators in pre-mount hooks
  This commit deletes the generator that was creating the sysroot.mount
  unit for ramdisk deployments. Generators, specially the sysroot.mount is
  expected to be created on very early stages of the boot procedure as
  this has impact on relevant targets such as initrd-root-fs.target, which
  does not depend on sysroot.mount if the unit is not there.
  In ramdisk deployments some data is known on pre-mount stage as
  as it is downloaded from the PXE server. At this stage it is not safe to
  generate a sysroot.mount unit that depends on initrd-root-fs.target as
  the target is close to finalize or even finalized already and could
  potentially skip sysroot.mount exection.
  Instead we include a mount hook which is only executed on ramdisk
  deployments that simply runs the mount command to mount /sysroot.
  This fixes bsc#1178670

  a proper factory class which also include type hints to facilitate
  it's use from an API POV. Related to #1498

- Modify lsblk flags for a consistent output across distros
  This commit modifies the lsblk flags to make use of the list format
  instead of raw output. `--list` flag seams to keep the geometry order
  and produces a consistent output in several distros.

- Bump version: 9.23.1 → 9.23.2

- Update kiwi-systemdeps-image-validation
  Make python anymarkup to be only recommended. The package
  does not exist on all distributions, e.g suse does not
  provide it and for kiwi it's an optional plugin

- Fixed missing provides tag
  When building WSL images the image type is set to appx.

  On s390 TW aaa_base is not pulled in by a dependency in obs.
  It looks like the package is pulled in by a file provides which
  is not resolved by obs. Thus the package needs to be added

  Moving the grub mkimage call as chroot operation also broke
  the creation of image builds that uses the legacy custom kiwi
  boot image feature instead of dracut. This commit fixes it

- Added leap box to be shown by build_status helper

- Refactor building of root cmdline setting
  Creating the root= cmdline parameter was based on methods
  that deals with the uuid. However, it's also possible to
  use a label information for the root= cmdline. To support
  this kiwi issued a 'blkid --uuid' command but that requires
  udev device names to be present on the host. The open
  buildservice workers do not run udev and fails apart the
  standard. This commit refactors the root cmdline setup
  to work with the device node as it exists during build
  time such that the blkid call runs against that device
  node.

- Bump version: 9.23.20 → 9.23.21

- Delete yum from packagemanager in schema
  Auto convert yum to dnf if set as packagemanager. This allows
  to delete the yum handling from code parts in kiwi where this
  was still present. In addition this fixes the inclusion of yum
  into the packagelist. This Fixes #1768

- Re-add suseImportBuildKey
  suseImportBuildKey is not required during the image build as kiwi imports the
  correct keys by itself. However, the created images lack the repository signing
  keys and any `zypper` commands will thus fail.
  This fixes https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi/issues/1876

- Bump version: 9.23.41 → 9.23.42

- Bump version: 9.23.40 → 9.23.41

- Remove util-linux-systemd &amp; util-linux Requires from dracut-kiwi-overlay
  These dependencies are pulled in via dracut-kiwi-lib.

- Add missing util-linux-systemd Requires to dracut-kiwi-[live,libs]

- Fixed test-image-orthos integration test
  The test was missing btrfs_root_is_snapshot which is required
  when using btrfs on tumbleweed.

- Fixed test-image-disk-legacy integration test
  The test did not set a device filter for ramdisk devices but
  activates unattended mode. In this mode the first device in
  the list is taken and this is a ramdisk device which is
  by default too small to be used for the installation. Thus</comment>

- Fixed fstab entry for swap on LVM
  If an LVM setup is used together with a swapspace the
  swap is created as a volume in the volume group. The
  required fstab entry to activate swap was not using
  the LVM exposed device but the UUID of the low level
  block layer. This low level device is not created
  by udev because LVM takes over precedence in this
  case.

- Bump version: 9.23.47 → 9.23.48

- Fixed LVM get_volumes
  Due to the change on the temporary directory yet another
  error in the volume manager classes for LVM got exposed.

- Bump version: 9.23.46 → 9.23.47

- Fixed LVM/btrfs volume based image builds
  Due to the change on the temporary directory an error
  in the volume manager classes for LVM and btrfs was
  exposed. There was code which uses a sub-part of the
  volume mount point directory which is a tempdir based
  directory name. The sub-part was choosen by an index
  based path split which worked for /tmp but no longer for
  /var/tmp. With tempdir now being also a commandline
  option this code has to become more robust.

- Fixed condition for GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=&quot;true&quot;
  The grub config parameter GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID must only
  be set if the device persistence setting is not UUID. However,
  in kiwi UUID device names are the default and doesn't have to
  be expressed explicitly. Therefore the condition to check
  for different than 'by-uuid' is wrong for the default case were
  no device persistence setting exists. This results in a wrong
  grub option to be set. This commit fixes it in a way to disable
  UUID device names in grub if the only other device persistency
  setting in kiwi named: 'by-label' is explicitly configured.
  This Fixes #1842

- Added force_trailing_slash argument to sync_data
  A speciality of the rsync tool is that it behaves differently
  if the given source_dir ends with a '/' or not. If it ends
  with a slash the data structure below will be synced to the
  target_dir. If it does not end with a slash the source_dir
  and its contents are synced to the target_dir. For example:
  source
  └── some_data
  1. $ rsync -a source target
  target
  └── source
  └── some_data
  2. $ rsync -a source/ target
  target
  └── some_data
  The parameter force_trailing_slash in the DataSync::sync_data</comment>

- Fixed regression in compression detection
  The change from 282529de8f612dee32d54ee868c2365dcd829220
  Introduced a bad regression. The assumption was made that the
  xz tool could be used to detect if a file is compressed or not.
  However, this requires the file to be locally present. In the
  scope of the method call is_compressed() and within a remote
  deployment e.g PXE this is not the case. Therefore the former
  way to &quot;detect&quot; the compression according to the .xz postfix
  of the source filename was restored. In addition the function
  name was changed to is_xz_compressed() because that's what the
  method can do and not more. This Fixes #2015

- Added debug option --debug-run-scripts-in-screen
  Instead of running scripts in screen if the --debug switch is
  set, we allow to explicitly switch on this behavior via
  a new option. This Fixes #2010

- Change packages target for bootincludes
  Packages marked with bootinclude=&quot;true&quot; will be added to the
  referenced kiwi boot image description if the initrd_system
  is set to &quot;kiwi&quot; instead of &quot;dracut&quot;. The package marked was
  primarily added to the type=&quot;image&quot; section and got only
  added to the type=&quot;bootstrap&quot; section if no image type section
  existed. However, it has turned out that this approach has
  the disadvantage that packages which must be installed as
  part of the bootstraping (e.g certificates) cannot be handled.
  This commit changes the behavior of the bootinclude to include
  the package always to the type=&quot;bootstrap&quot; section.</comment>

- Fixed UUID used in grub early boot script
  In case the system is luks encrypted the UUID of the root
  partition was used in the grub early boot script. However,
  this condition is only correct if in addition to the luks
  encryption the boot area is on crypto too. If boot is not
  on crypto the UUID must be the boot partition and not root.
  Only if root AND boot is on crypto the kiwi created early
  boot script includes the grub cryptomount calls.

- Followup fix for force deleting debian packages
  The force uninstall deletes pre scripts prior removal
  because if they fail the package will not be removed.
  For a force uninstall we consider this ok. However,
  the deletion of the scripts did not happen in the
  image root. This patch fixes it

- Followup fix for force deleting debian packages
  Pass --force-depends to allow uninstall even if the
  dependency checker complains

- Fix use of xattrs for container sync
  when syncing data for containers only a subset of xattr
  attributes can be applied. This Fixes #2009

- Fix LABEL detection (#2112)
  When only &quot;root=&quot; is specified on the kernel command line the match is
  located in the first group. Loop through the groups upon mtach to find
  what we are looking for.

- Preserve LABEL setting (#2108)
  Preserve the LABEL= setting when the grub config file is re-generated.
  the GRUB_ENABLE_LINUX_LABEL setting does not exists upstream and
  not in any SUSE distribution. Set the grub setting such that LABEL
  is preserved on SUSE distros. (bsc#1197616)

- Fix test_setup_default_grub_empty_kernelcmdline
  The unit test exists to check that GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
  is not set depending on the provided cmdline. The test exists
  for reasons explained in Issue #1650

- Don't compress .appx containers (#2106)
  The container is actually inside and already compressed.

- Added new CloneDevice class
  Added CloneDevice class to the storage interface.
  The class allows to create clone(s) from a given source
  block device into a list of target block devices.
  The target block devices are clones of the source but
  prevents device naming conflicts for unique identifiers
  like the UUID. This is requires to still allow to boot
  from images containing device clones and needs to be
  handled by tools that might work on top of the cloned</comment>
