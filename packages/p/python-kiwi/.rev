  enabled and gpgcheck parameters has to be set for any
  configured yum repository
  

  
- Fixup repository setup for yum
  
  Yum cannot handle spaces between the key and the value.
  This patch provides a method to tell ConfigParser to use
  no spaces for the '=' delimiter and thus Fixes #357
  

  
- Reactivate warnings report in pytest
  

  
- Fixup kernel name lookup
  
  If multiple abi compatible kernel module packages are installed
  the kernel version of the boot kernel could be different from
  the kernel module versions. In order to find the boot kernel
  all kernel versions found must be checked. Fixes #355</comment>

- Rebuild online schema documentation
  

  
- Bump version: 9.11.0 → 9.11.1
  

  
- Fixed kernelList function
  
  The kernelList function searches for the installed kernels
  and applies the corresponding initrd name. The information the
  method provides is used in case of a custom initrd which should
  be used instead of the result of dracut. When requesting the use
  of the kiwi firsboot initrd also in the system via the
  &lt;oem-kiwi-initrd&gt; element, the information from the list is
  used to correctly link the kiwi initrd named initrd.vmx to the
  expected name of the system as dracut would create it. The
  creation of the list was broken which lead to an empty list
  and the after effect that the system was not able to reboot.
  This Fixes #483

- Delete atftp from SLE15 boot descriptions
  
  atftp will not be part of SLE15 per fate#323633.
  This Fixes #543
  

  
- Fixed blocksize setup in losetup
  
  The -L option was used to set the blocksize value for losetup
  However there is an option name clash between suse util-linux
  and upstream which now leads to the problem that option -L
  has changed its meaning and actually means --nooverlap which
  completely breaks the call in kiwi. This patch changes the
  call to use the long form --logical-blocksize.
  This Fixes bsc#1066873

- Omit kiwi-repart dracut module in oemboot initrd
  
  KIWI's oemboot initrd with initrd_system=&quot;dracut&quot; together with
  installiso=&quot;true&quot; requires to have dracut-kiwi-oem-repart package
  installed in the system, thus it ends up also being included in the
  recreated dracut initrd after booting the oemboot initrd from the
  installation iso. This kiwi-repart module causes a boot failure in that
  case since no .profile file is present, moreover, it has no sense to
  run it at that stage, since the disk is already reparted by the
  oemboot code.
  
  This commit allows installiso=&quot;true&quot; and initrd_system=&quot;dracut&quot; to
  play well together.</comment>

- Fixed kiwi dracut config for the final system
  
  Once the image has been deployed on the target and the
  system is up and running some of the kiwi dracut modules
  used for deployment are no longer needed and should not be
  taken into account when another dracut call happens on the
  system.

- Make sure there are no busy devices on reboot
  
  If the dracut kiwi-repart module skips the repartition step
  because the disk was already repartitioned it leaves devices
  in busy state which leads to a rescue shell at the system
  mount stage

- Update .virtualenv.dev-requirements.txt
  
  sphinx 1.7.0 is not compatible with travis-sphinx
  thus we stick with 1.6.7 until travis-sphinx followed
  the sphinx changes
  

  
- Add restrictions to Path.remove_hierarchy
  
  When an iso file is used as repo, this iso will be loop mounted on
  the host and bind mounted into the image root as long as the image
  builds. When the mount is released a recursive cleanup of the complete
  path happens. This is done by calling Path.remove_hierarchy. However
  if a sub path of the mount path contains a system root directory
  which is mandatory for the Linux root system it is not allowed
  to be deleted even if it is empty at the time of the mount cleanup.
  Thus this patch adds a lookup for protected directory names and
  only runs the recursive deletion as long as no protected member
  is part of the path. This fixes bsc#1080301

- Deleted obsolete boot descriptions
  
  The custom kiwi boot descriptions has been moved into

  dracut module packages provided by kiwi. The classic
  custom boot descriptions can still be used as alternative
  method if the above package is installed. Related to
  Issue #576
  

  
- Create compatible boot options
  
  The boot option root=install:CDLABEL= is mandatory for install
  images which uses the dracut initrd system. But for the custom

- Fixed btrfs search path in earlyboot script
  
  If kiwi generates its own efi image for the boot process
  it does not setup the btrfs relative path setup in the
  earlyboot script embedded into the generated efi image.
  This has a bad impact on the file search because the
  btrfs setup done in kiwi puts root below the @ volume
  which we then need to specify of the relative lookup
  is not activated. Fixes bsc#1082155
  

  
- Bump version: 9.13.3 → 9.13.4
  

  
- Use LABEL for the swap partition
  
  If multipath and device maps are active the fstab entry should use
  the LABEL reference. Systemd calls swapon and it only works properly
  with multipath devices when LABEL reference is used or calling directly
  on the /dev/dm-* device file.

- Delete obsolete hybrid attribute from type
  
  Any iso image we create will be a hybrid image. That was
  already the default for any install iso image and was a
  configuration option for live images. The optional selection
  only existed for systems which do not provide tools to
  make an iso hybrid. All distributions kiwi supports provides
  this capabilities and there is no good reason why a live
  or install iso should not be hybrid and bootable as iso
  and as disk. Also the boot in disk mode became the preferred
  boot method for the majority of our users which requires
  to provide a hybrid iso

- Fix default initrd_system values
  
  This commit fixes the default initrd_system value for some image
  types. Since this value is included in profile and potentially
  taken into account for some of the config script functions, it is
  important to have consistent values even when the image type
  has no initrd choice or it doesn't have initrd at all.

- Fixed detection of disk node in live iso images
  
  If the live iso is booted as disk the initrd code needs to
  find the correct disk node pointing to the iso image. This
  was formerly done by checking if the populated disk devices
  contains an iso header with an application id. The information
  was obtained using the isoinfo tool. isoinfo is a tool</comment>

- Fixed check for volume group in use
  
  The former implementation evaluates the output of the vgs
  command and set the volume group as in use if one of the
  listed volume groups on the host contains the group name
  set by the image description. This would also match if the
  group name set in the image description is e.g 'System' and
  the a volume group on the host with name 'SystemVG' exists.
  However a conflict only exists on exact match of the name.
  The proposed fix is to use the --select feature from vgs
  and let it show information on exact match of the vg_name
  field. The code in kiwi then just evaluates if the selection
  by vgs has a value or not. This Fixes #721
  

  
- Fix setup of kiwi_lvm profile variable
  
  kiwi_lvm was always set to true if a volume management system
  is in use. However it should only be set to true if the
  selected volume management system is lvm. The same applies
  to the kiwi_lvmgroup variable which also only makes sense
  if the lvm volume management system is used.

- Add a chapter for uninstall package requests in docs (#726)
  
  Add a chapter for uninstall package requests in docs
  

  
- Update arm integration test
  
  Existing panda build was outdated and non functional.
  Move the test to a more popular target and write the
  image description to use technology matching the
  suse arm development effort. Target is now Rpi(64bit)
  

  
- Use latest version of sphinx
  
  Formerly sphinx==1.6.7 was used because travis-sphinx failed
  with latest sphinx. Now travis-sphinx fails with 1.6.7 and
  I hope using latest sphinx will fix that

- Fix zypper add lock operations
  
  This commit fixes the arguments passed to zypper in add lock
  operations.
  

  
- Add correct GPL-3.0-or-later license
  
  Add the correct license reference in the spec License field
  
  Fixes #732
  

  
- Make container compression a configuration option
  
  Change the ContainerBuilder class to evaluate on the
  configuration options to decide if the container archive
  should be compressed or not. By default the archive will
  be compressed, thus there is no change to the former behavior
  but can be setup in ~/.config/kiwi/config.yml as follows:

- Fix result bundle command
  
  This commits fixes a regression introduced in 98c9c77a
  

  
- Bump version: 9.16.4 → 9.16.5
  

  
- Fixup validation of boottimeout attribute
  
  If boottimeout is set to zero it is evaluated as &quot;not set&quot;
  and the default applies. However it's a fairly well approach
  to set a zero second boot timeout. This Fixes #789
  

  
- Do not replace version from the image name
  
  This commit makes sure that replacing version to version plus the
  build id on resulting files happens only on version suffixes. Before
  that if image name was including the version string it, this part was
  also replaced.
  
  Fixes #787 (bsc#1102868)</comment>

- Fix use of SysConfig objects
  
  objects of that class did not provide a get method but
  overload the bracket [] operator. Using the get() method
  failed. This Fixes #910
  

  
- Use chkstat to verify and fix file permissions
  
  Call chkstat in system mode which reads /etc/sysconfig/security
  to determine the configured security level and applies the
  appropriate permission definitions from the /etc/permissions*
  files. It's possible to provide those files as overlay files
  in the image description to apply a certain permission setup
  when needed. Otherwise the default setup as provided on the
  package level applies. It's required that the image root system
  has chkstat installed. If not present KIWI skips this step
  and continuous with a warning. This Fixes #895

  With this commit it is possible to set tcp or upd (e.g. &quot;80/tcp&quot;) for
  exposed container ports. If no protocol is provided OCI defaults are</comment>

- Changed default value for bundler compression
  
  If no compression is configured in the kiwi config file
  the default was set to: False. However this lead to big
  trouble on the obs side for images which has fixed
  storage disk sizes configured, e.g Azure images which
  requests 30G disk size per instance. Thus the default
  for the bundler compression has changed to be: True</comment>

- Update the documentation regarding vagrant boxes
  Extend the documentation on how to build VirtualBox vagrant boxes
  All this was done by Dan Čermák &lt;dcermak@suse.com&gt;

- Refactor incremental changelog update
  The creation of the package changelog is based on a reference file.
  However that reference file contained log information in a specific
  timezone which requires to hardcode the region of that timezone
  in the code to correctly run date/time calculations. This can
  be done better from a conceptual point of view. This patch changes
  the handling in a way that the reference file is a git log
  excerpt including the dates as git log lists them. The dates
  contains complete numeric time/date/zone information and can be
  used for calculations. The changelog helper tool converts the
  result data to match the requirements of rpm changelog files
  and prints the time/date information localized to the callers
  timezone or as UTC if the --utc switch is given. By default the
  user local timezone settings applies. That way the setup of
  the local timezone is immaterial to the changelog processor
  and the workaround in the gitlab-ci rpm stage can be deleted
  too.

- Fix derived docker images build
  This commit fixes the derived docker images when the base image is a
  compressed file. After the refactor in #998 the decompression of the
  base image and the skopeo call to import the decompressed image happened
  in absolutely independent scopes. NamedTemporaryFile python class by
  default deletes the created temporary file when the class instance is</comment>

- Update obs docs per review by Tom

- Disable check-valid-until with repository_gpgcheck
  This commit is two fold:
  * From one side fixes a wrong use of the `trusted` option for
  apt repositories. `trusted=no` does not force to run the gpg checks
  it just forces the repository to be considered untrusted regardless
  the result of the security checks.
  * From the other side it disables the option `check-valid-until` in
  case gpg checks are disabled using the `repository_gpgcheck`. It
  works at repository level. This enables using unmaintained or
  expired repositories for the build.
  Fixes #1028

- Simplify shell pipe expression with shell builtin
  Replace &quot;echo $var | sed ...&quot; expression with ${var//SEARCH/REPLACE}
  shell builtin as suggested by Codacy

- Make mediacheck runtime check arch independent
  The check_mediacheck_only_for_x86_arch runtime check fails on
  non x86 architectures but the tagmedia toolchain exists independent
  of the platform architecture. This Fixes #1091

- Set home as protected path
  Along with adding home to the protection list, cleanup
  the prepare instance cleanup code in a way that it only
  runs if a root_bind object exists which needs to call
  its cleanup path</comment>

- Update Boot From Hard Disk method
  Instead of searching for an efi binary to boot, use the exit method
  that exits from grub and let the firmware choose the next entry
  in the device list

- Do not crash on missing HOME

- Added live ISO integration tests for arm

- Consolidate syslinux file names and search paths
  Handle those file names and search path in the Defaults space
  and only once in the code

- Remove '^' which break BaseStripFirmware function (boo#1132455)

- Do not supress output for dracut call
  This commit adds a stderr_to_stdout option to Command.run method to
  redirect stderr to stdout.
  Additionally this commit also includes to the debug log the dracut
  call output, including both, stderr and stdout.
  Fixes #1114

- Fixed path_test unit test
  The code there checked for the message of an exception
  but recent changes in pytest did not allow to do it that
  way anymore.

- Fixed zipl bootloader setup</comment>

- Fixed left over import of six module
  The use of the six compat module was needed to support py2
  With the drop of py2 support all of six was no longer needed.
  However this one was overlooked.

- 99-kiwi-lib requires rmdir, install it
  Fixes bsc#1143033

- Bump version: 9.18.7 → 9.18.8

- Added multiconsole setup to Fedora build test

- Allow multiple values for grub terminal setup
  With regards to the grub documentation from
  https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#terminal_005finput
  multiple terminal consoles can be active. This patch allows
  to specify terminal collection between serial, console and gfxterm
  This Fixes #1123

- Bump version: 9.18.6 → 9.18.7

- Fixed use of Command calls in destructors
  The Command class creates namedtuple to store the result
  of the call. That tuple is created inside of the Command
  namespace. If called inside of a __del__ destructor which
  is often the case in kiwi classes I recently observed an
  exception from python saying:

- Update Host/Image support matrix
  Update documentation about the Host vs. Image support and
  compatibility matrix with regards to the SLES target.

- Add default /etc/kiwi.yml file
  Provide a comment only etc/kiwi.yml file that contains all
  parameters we support so far including a short description
  This Fixes #1232

- Bump version: 9.18.27 → 9.18.28

- Delete left over print statement from unit test

- Enable BLS configuration if is supported
  Fedora now uses a BLS configuration by default, but this is not supported
  by all distributions. So check if is supported by the grub2-mkconfig tool
  and only enable the option if that's the case.
  Fixes: #1248

- Bump Fedora x86 build test to Fedora30

- Bump version: 9.18.26 → 9.18.27

- Fix btrfs_root_is_snapshot
  This commit makes sure the chrooted operations of over a loop device
  including btrfs subvolumes and root as an snapshot include the
  `/.snapshots` subvolume mount. This is necessary for certain operations
  that depend on the layout, e.g. grub configuration using `grub2-mkconfig`.</comment>
