- update to 24.8.0:
  * Added the :func:`~webcolors.names` function to allow
    retrieving lists of color names. The underlying mappings of
    color names/values still are not supported API; to obtain the
    color value corresponding to a name, use the appropriate
    conversion function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 30 09:14:36 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 24.6.0:
  * Supported Python versions are now 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
  * Running the unit tests no longer uses a third-party test
    runner; the standard-library unittest module's runner is used
    instead.
  * Documentation of the HTML5 color algorithms has been updated
    to emphasize which HTML5 spec is used (the WHATWG spec, which
    is now the only canonical and maintained HTML5 spec) and
    comments in the implementations have been updated to include
    the latest prose description of the HTML5 algorithms from the
    spec. These updates do not change the behavior of the HTML5
    algorithms, and are only for clarity of documentation and
    explanation.
  * Adopted CalVer versioning.
  * The raw mappings of color names/values are no longer publicly
    exposed; use the appropriate normalizing conversion functions
    instead of accessing the mappings directly.

- update to 24.6.0:
  * to use a CalVer version number was 24.6.0.
  * The API stability/deprecation policy for this library is as
    follows:
  * The supported stable public API of this library is the set of
    symbols which are exported by its __all__ declaration and
    which are documented in this documentation. For classes
    exported there, the supported stable public API is the set of
    methods and attributes of those classes whose names do not
    begin with one or more underscore (_) characters and which
    are documented in this documentation.
  * When a public API is to be removed, or undergo a backwards-
    incompatible change, it will emit a deprecation warning which
    serves as notice of the intended removal or change, and which
    will give a date -- which will always be at least in the next
    calendar year after the first release which emits the
    deprecation warning -- past which the removal or change may
    occur without further warning.
  * Security fixes, and fixes for high-severity bugs (such as
    those which might cause unrecoverable crash or data loss),
    are not required to emit deprecation warnings, and may -- if
    needed -- impose backwards-incompatible change in any
    release. If this occurs, this changelog document will contain
    a note explaining why the usual deprecation process could not
    be followed for that case.
  * This policy is in effect as of the adoption of CalVer
    versioning, with version 24.6.0 of this library.
  * Released June 2024
  * Supported Python versions are now 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
  * Running the unit tests no longer uses a third-party test
    runner; the standard-library unittest module's runner is used
    instead.
  * Documentation of the HTML5 color algorithms has been updated
    to emphasize which HTML5 spec is used (the WHATWG spec, which
    is now the only canonical and maintained HTML5 spec) and
    comments in the implementations have been updated to include
    the latest prose description of the HTML5 algorithms from the
    spec. These updates do not change the behavior of the HTML5
    algorithms, and are only for clarity of documentation and
    explanation.
  * Adopted CalVer versioning.
  * The raw mappings of color names/values are no longer publicly
    exposed; use the appropriate normalizing conversion functions
    instead of accessing the mappings directly.

- update to 1.13:
  * Supported Python versions are now 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and
    3.11.  The codebase was significantly reorganized and modernized.
    Public API is unchanged. Imports should continue to be directly
    from the top-level ``webcolors`` module; attempting to import
    from submodules is not supported.
  * Now packaging declaratively via ``pyproject.toml`` with `PEP
    517

    core team; accordingly, Python 2 support is dropped. Supported
    Python versions are now 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

- update to 1.9.1
  * When asked to provide a color name, using the CSS3/SVG set of names, for
    the hexadecimal value #808080, the integer triplet rgb(128, 128, 128), or
    the percentage triplet rgb(50%, 50%, 50%), webcolors now always returns
    u'gray', never u'grey'.
  * Added a set of constants to use when referring to specifications that
    define color names <spec-constants>.
