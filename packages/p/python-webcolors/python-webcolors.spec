%description
Webcolors is a simple Python module for working with HTML/CSS
color definitions.

Support is included for normalizing and converting between the
following formats (RGB colorspace only; conversion to/from HSL can be
handled by the ``colorsys`` module in the Python standard library):

* Specification-defined color names
* Six-digit hexadecimal
* Three-digit hexadecimal
* Integer ``rgb()`` triplet
* Percentage ``rgb()`` triplet

Implementations are also provided for the HTML5 color parsing and
serialization algorithms.

Full documentation is `available online <http://webcolors.readthedocs.org/>`_.
