         various fixes relating to automargins for small figures

- changes from version 4.13.0:
  * Added
    + px.choropleth, px.scatter_geo and px.line_geo now support
      faceting as well as fitbounds and basemap_visible 2923
    + px.scatter_geo and px.line_geo now support geojson/featureidkey
      input 2923
    + px.scatter_geo now supports symbol 2923
    + go.Figure now has a set_subplots method to set subplots on an
      already existing figure. 2866
    + Added Turbo colorscale and fancier swatch display functions 2882
    + A utility function image_array_to_data_uri has been added in
      plotly.utils, in order to transform NumPy arrays to data b64
      URIs (which can be passed to the source parameter of go.Image,
      or to layout images). 2879
    + the selector argument to updater/selector functions now accepts
      ints and strs 2894
  * Updated
    + the JSON serialization of plotly figures has been accelerated
      thanks to a different handling of Infinity and NaN values. For
      example, a figure with a 1000x1000 Heatmap should now serialize
      2x faster. 2880
    + Coding mistakes with "magic underscores" now return
      significantly more ergonomic error messages 2843
    + Error messages related to impossible subplot geometries are now
      much more helpful 2897
  * Fixed
    + px.scatter_geo support for text is fixed 2923
    + the x and y parameters of px.imshow are now used also in the
      case where an Image trace is used (for RGB data or with
      binary_string=True). However, only numerical values are accepted
      (while the Heatmap trace allows date or string values for x and
      y). 2761

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 22:32:20 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.12.0:
  * Added
    + For add_trace, add_shape, add_annotation and add_layout_image,
      the row and/or col argument now also accept the string
      "all". row="all" adds the object to all the subplot rows and
      col="all" adds the object to all the subplot columns. (#2840)
    + Shapes that reference the plot axes in one dimension and the
      data in another dimension can be added with the new add_hline,
      add_vline, add_hrect, add_vrect functions, which also support
      the row="all" and col="all" arguments. (#2840)
    + The add_trace, add_shape, add_annotation, add_layout_image,
      add_hline, add_vline, add_hrect, add_vrect functions accept an
      argument exclude_empty_subplots which if True, only adds the
      object to subplots already containing traces or layout
      objects. This is useful in conjunction with the row="all" and
      col="all" arguments. (#2840)
    + For all go.Figure functions accepting a selector argument (e.g.,
      select_traces), this argument can now also be a function which
      is passed each relevant graph object (in the case of
      select_traces, it is passed every trace in the figure). For
      graph objects where this function returns true, the graph object
      is included in the selection. (#2844)
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.57.1. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information. These changes are reflected in the
      auto-generated plotly.graph_objects module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 10 19:07:17 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.11.0:
  * Updated Plotly.js to version 1.56.0. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
    for more information. These changes are reflected in the
    auto-generated plotly.graph_objects module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 12 19:58:52 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.10.0:
  * Added
    + Added plotly.io.full_figure_for_development() and
      plotly.graph_objects.Figure.full_figure_for_development()
      (#2737)
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.55.2. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information. These changes are reflected in the
      auto-generated plotly.graph_objects module.
    + px.imshow has a new binary_string boolean argument, which passes
      the image data as a b64 binary string when True. Using binary
      strings allow for faster image rendering and smaller figure
      size. Additional optional arguments binary_backend,
      binary_format and binary_compression_level control how to
      generate the b64 string (#2691
    + px.imshow has a new constrast_rescaling argument in order to
      choose how to set data values corresponding to the bounds of the
      color range (#2691
  * Fixed
    + Plotly Express no longer converts datetime columns of input
      dataframes to UTC (#2749)
    + Plotly Express has more complete support for datetimes as
      additional hover_data (#2749)
    + Histogram selection behaviour with FigureWidget (#2711) with
      thanks to @meffmadd
    + Behaviour of full_html() with html=False (#2469) with thanks to
      @tallamjr
    + ff.distplot() now only computes traces that will be shown
      (#2730) with thanks to @akbo
    + Pandas backend .hist() works with latest version of Pandas
      (#2713) with thanks to @Kerybas

- changes from version 4.9.0:
  * Added
    + Added image export support using Kaleido. The image export
      backend can be configured using the new engine argument to
      plotly.io.to_image and plotly.io.write_image. The engine
      argument may be set to "kaleido", "orca", or "auto". The default
      is engine="auto", in which case the Kaleido backend is enabled
      if the kaleido package from PyPI is installed, otherwise Orca is
      used. (#2613).
    + plotly.express.timeline() added as an official alternative to
      plotly.figure_factories.create_gantt() (#2626)
    + create_hexbin_mapbox() added to Figure Factories, with thanks to
      @RenaudLN for the impressive contribution!
    + facet_row_spacing and facet_col_spacing added to Plotly Express
      cartesian 2d functions (#2614)
    + base added to Plotly Express bar and bar_polar functions (#2626)
    + px.NO_COLOR constant to override wide-form color assignment in
      Plotly Express (#2614)
  * Fixed
    + trendline traces are now of type scattergl when
      render_mode="webgl" in Plotly Express (#2614)
    + regression from 4.8.1 whereby "parent" was not accepted as part
      of path for px.sunburst() and px.treemap() (#2640)
    + create_dendrogram() figure factory now works correctly with
      scipy 1.5.1 (#2627)
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.6. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information.
    + Added all cartesian-2d Plotly Express functions, plus imshow, to
      Pandas backend with kind option (#2541)
    + plotly.express.imshow now uses data frame index and columns
      names and values to populate axis parameters by default (#2539)
    + Javascript extensions are now build using Node 12, and have an
      updated package-lock.json with many fewer security warnings
      (#2636)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 11 19:18:52 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.8.2:
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.5. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information.
    + add_traces() now accepts bare int-like values for rows/cols as
      well as lists thereof (#2546), with thanks to @MCBoarder289 for
      the contribution!
  * Fixed
    + row/col now accept int-like values, not strictly int values
      (#2451), with thanks to @MCBoarder289 for the contribution!
    + Fixed special cases with px.sunburst and px.treemap with path
      input (#2524)
    + Fixed bug in hover_data argument of px functions, when the
      column name is changed with labels and hover_data is a
      dictionary setting up a specific format for the hover data
      (#2544).
    + Made the Plotly Express trendline argument more robust and made
      it work with datetime x values (#2554)
    + Fixed bug in px.sunburst and px.treemap: when the color and
      values arguments correspond to the same column, a different
      aggregation function has to be used for the two arguments
      (#2591)
    + Plotly Express wide mode now accepts mixed integer and float
      columns (#2598)
    + Plotly Express range_(x|y) should not impact the unlinked range
      of marginal subplots (#2600)
    + px.line now sets line_group=<variable> in wide mode by default
      (#2599)
    + Corrected some regex warnings (#2577), with thanks to @georgevdd
      for the contribution!

- changes from version 4.8.1:
  * Fixed
    + Fixed the accidental removal of some functions and submodules
      from plotly.colors and plotly.express.colors

- changes from version 4.8.0:
  * Added
    + plotly now provides a Plotly Express-backed Pandas-compatible
      plotting backend, which can be activated via
      pandas.options.plotting.backend = "plotly". Note that it is not
      intended to implement every Pandas plotting function, nor is it
      intended to replicate the behaviour of every argument, although
      per the changes below, x and y should behave similarly. (#2336)
    + New datasets have been added to plotly.express.data: stocks,
      experiment, medals_wide and medals_long. (#2336)
    + plotly go.Figure and go.FigureWidget now have a _repr_html_ and
      a _repr_mimebundle_ method, which are standard hooks for
      integration in systems based on IPython. In particular, with
      _repr_html_ plotly figures can now be used within sphinx-gallery
      without any scraper. These additions should not change anything
      to the way plotly figures are displayed in notebook
      environments, since the _ipython_display_ method (already
      present in earlier versions) takes precedence over the new
      methods.
  * Updated
    + The behaviour of the x, y, orientation, histfunc, violinmode,
      boxmode and stripmode arguments for 2d-cartesian functions in
      Plotly Express (i.e. scatter, line, area, bar, histogram,
      violin, box, strip, funnel, density_heatmap and density_contour)
      has been refined (#2336):
    + if x or y is missing, it is inferred to be the index of
      data_frame if data_frame provided, otherwise a stable index of
      integers starting at 0. In the case of px.bar, if the provided
      value is not continuous, the missing value is treated as a
      column of 1s named "count", so as to behave more like
      px.histogram and to avoid sizing the resulting bars differently
      based on their position in the column. Previously, missing
      values defaulted to integers starting at 0 per trace which made
      it potentially inconsistent or misleading.
    + if x (y) is missing, orientation now defaults to v
      (h). Previously it always defaulted to v but this is not
      considered a breaking change, as the cases in which it now
      defaults to h caused unreadable output if set to v.
    + if both x and y are provided and one of them does not contain
      continuous values, orientation defaults to the value
      perpendicular to that axis. Previously it always defaulted to v
      but this is not considered a breaking change, as the cases in
      which it now defaults to h caused unreadable output if set to v.
    + if either x or y (but not both) may now be provided as a list of
      column references into data_frame or columns of data, in which
      case the imputed data frame will be treated as "wide" data and
      melt()ed internally before applying the usual mapping rules,
      with function-specific defaults.
    + if neither x nor y is provided but data_frame is, the data frame
      will be treated as "wide" with defaults depending on the value
      of orientation (and orientation has accordingly been added to
      scatter, line, density_heatmap, and density_contour for this
      purpose). Previously this would have resulted in an empty
      figure.
    + if both x and y are provided to histogram, and if x, y and z are
      provided to density_heatmap or density_contour, then histfunc
      now defaults to sum so as to avoid ignoring the provided data,
      and to cause histogram and bar to behave more similarly.
    + violinmode, boxmode and stripmode now default to overlay if x
      (y) in in v (h) orientation is also mapped to color, to avoid
      strange spacing issues with the previous default of group in all
      cases.
    + The Plotly Express arguments color_discrete_map, symbol_map and
      line_dash_map now accept the string "identity" which causes the
      corresponding input data to be used as-is rather than mapped
      into color_discrete_sequence, symbol_sequence or
      line_dash_sequence, respectively. (#2336)
    + Plotly Express now accepts px.Constant or px.Range objects in
      the place of column references so as to express constant or
      increasing integer values. (#2336)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  9 16:19:10 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.7.1:
  * Fixed
    + Fix AttributeError: module 'plotly.graph_objs' has no attribute
      'FigureWidget' exception on from plotly.graph_objs import * when
      ipywidgets is not installed. Error also occurred when importing
      plotly.figure_factor. It is now possible to import
      plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget when ipywidgets is not installed,
      and an informative ImportError exception will be raised in the
      FigureWidget constructor (#2443, #1111).
    + Fix TypeError: unhashable type: 'Template' during Figure
      construction when plotly.io.templates.default is set to a
      Template object rather than a string.

- changes from version 4.7.0:
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.1. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information. The main new feature of this version of
      Plotly.js is the possibility to draw layout shapes, using custom
      dragmodes and corresponding modebar buttons.
    + The sphinx-gallery scraper has been updated to work with
      different structures of galleries #2149
  * Added
    + The hover_data parameter of px functions can now be a
      dictionary. This makes it possible to skip hover information for
      some arguments or to change the formatting of hover informatiom
      #2377.
    + It's now possible to build a development version of Plotly.py
      against the build artifacts from a non-master branch of
      Plotly.js, which makes for faster QA and development cycles
      #2349. Thanks @zouhairm for this Pull Request!
  * Fixed
    + Plotly Express trendlines now handle missing data correctly
      #2357
  * Performance
    + This version includes several performance improvements (#2368,
      #2403).
    + Child graph objects (e.g. figure.layout.xaxis) are no longer
      created eagerly during graph object construction. Instead, they
      are created lazily the first time the property is accessed.
    + Property validation is now disabled for select internal
      operations.
    + When used with Python 3.7 and above, ploty.py now takes
      advantage of PEP-562 to perform submodule imports lazily. This
      dramatically improves import times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 11 21:47:18 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

Thu Jan 30 17:27:22 UTC 2020 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 4.5.0
  + Updated
    * Updated Plotly.js to version 1.52.1.
    * Plotly Express uses the new `legend.title` attribute and so now has shorter trace `name`s
    * The heuristic used by `px.parallel_categories` to determine which columns of the data frame to draw has been changed and made more configurable with the `dimensions_max_cardinality` argument
    * The `simple_white` colorbar styling has been streamlined
    * The `jupyterlab-plotly` and `plotlywidget` JupyterLab extensions should now share code when installed together, resulting in smaller JupyterLab vendor bundle sizes

Fri Dec 13 00:25:52 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.4.1:
  * Fixed
    + Fixed improper JSON encoding exception when the pillow module
      not installed #1993

- changes from version 4.4.0:
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.51.2. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG

    + The tutorials of the plotly.py documentation are now in the main
      plotly.py Github repository. Contributions in order to improve
      or extend the documentation are very welcome!
    + plotly.express generated plots no longer have a default height
      of 600 pixels, instead they inherit the default height of
      regular figures #1990. To restore the old behavior, set
      px.defaults.height=600 once per session, or set the height
      keyword arguement to any px.function() to 600.
  * Fixed
    + Fixed a plotly.express input bug when using data frame
      indices#1934
    + Fixed how to display facet labels with plotly express #1966

      bar_polar) now have a range_theta keyword argument for
      representing only an angular section #1969.
    + All continuous colorscales now accept a _r suffix that reverses
      their direction #1933

- Disable python2 support since dependencies dropped python2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 16 17:52:20 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.3.0:
  * Updated
    + Updated Plotly.js to version 1.51.1. See the plotly.js CHANGELOG
      for more information
    + Improved propagation of empty templates (#1892)
    + Update the add_annotations/add_shapes/add_images methods to no
      longer default to adding objects in paper coordinates. This
      allows plotly.js to determine the default reference frame based
      on context (#1888)
    + Use the default template's background color for displaying color
      swatches (#1872). Special thanks to @joelostblom for this
      contribution!
    + Improved docstrings (#1835, #1837)
  * Added
    + Added image trace type (plotly.js#4289, plotly.js#4307,
      plotly.js#4313, plotly.js#4319)
    + Added matplotlib-style plotly.express.imshow convenience
      function to display images and heatmaps (#1855, #1885)
    + Added matplotlib-style simple_white template (#1864). Special
      thanks to @joelostblom for this contribution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 25 17:14:49 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to 4.0.0
  + Updated
    * Updated Plotly.js to version 1.48.3.
  + Added
    * The Plotly Express tech preview has been integrated as the `plotly.express` module
    * Added a new renderers framework the supports rendering figure in a wide variety of contexts. See the new Displaying Plotly Figures documentation page for more information.
    * Added `plotly.io.write_html` and `plotly.io.to_html` functions for exporting figures to HTML. Also available as `.write_html` and `.to_html` figure methods.
    * Added new figure methods for batch updating figure properties (`update_layout`, `update_traces`, `update_xaxes`, etc.).  See the new Creating and Updating Figures documentation page for more details.
    * Added support for all trace types in `make_subplots`
    * Added support for secondary y-axes in `make_subplots`
    * Support passing a scalar trace object (rather than a list or tuple of trace objects) as the `data` property to the `Figure` constructor
    * Added dictionary-stule `.pop` method to graph object classes
    * New `jupyterlab-plotly` JupyterLab extension for rendering figures in JupyterLab. Replaces the `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension, and includes JupyterLab 1.0 support.
    * Added new suite of built-in colorscales to the `plotly.colors` module, and support for specifying this wide range of colorscales by name. Also added support for specifying colorscales as a list of colors, in which case the color spacing is assumed to be uniform.
    * Added `sphinx-gallery` renderer for embedding plotly figures in Sphinx-Gallery.
  + Removed
    * The follow modules for interfacing with the Chart Studio cloud service have been removed from plotly.py and moved to the new `chart-studio` distribution package.  The following modules have been moved to a new top-level `chart_studio` module:
      > `plotly.plotly` -> `chart_studio.plotly`
      > `plotly.api` -> `chart_studio.api`
      > `plotly.dashboard_objs` -> `chart_studio.dashboard_objs`
      > `plotly.grid_objs` -> `chart_studio.grid_objs`
      > `plotly.presentation_objs` -> `chart_studio.presentation_objs`
    * The legacy `plotly.widgets.GraphWidget` class for displaying online figures hosted by Chart Studio as ipywidgets has been removed. Please use the offline, and much more capable, `plotly.graph_objects.FigureWidget` class instead.
    * The `fileopt` argument to `chart_studio.plotly.plot` has been removed, so in-place modifications to previously published figures are no longer supported, and a figure will always overwrite a figure with the same name.
  + Changed
    * The `'plotly'` template is used as the default theme across all figures.
    * In order to reduce the size of the core `plotly` distribution package, the bundled geographic shape files used by the `create_choropleth` figure factory have been moved to a new optional `plotly-geo` distribution package
    * For consistency with other figure factories, the `create_choropleth`  and `create_gantt` figure factories now always returns `Figure` objects, rather than dictionaries.
    * Figure add trace methods (`.add_trace`, `.add_traces`, `.add_scatter`, etc.) now return a reference to the calling figure, rather than the newly created trace
    * `plotly.tools.make_subplots` has been moved to `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility
    * The `plotly.graph_objs` module has been moved to `plotly.graph_objects`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility
    * Trace `uid` properties are only generated automatically when a trace is added to a `FigureWidget`.  When a trace is added to a standard `Figure` graph object the input `uid`, if provided, is accepted as is.
    * `datetime` objects that include timezones are not longer converted to UTC
    * When a tuple property (e.g. `layout.annotations`) is updated with a list/tuple that is longer than the current value, the extra elements are appended to the end of the tuple.
  + Fixed
    * Fixed visibility of `bar` trace error bars in built-in templates

Fri Jan  4 19:08:41 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.5.0
  + Updated
    * Updated Plotly.js to version 1.43.1. See the
      plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1431----2018-12-21)
      or more information.
  + Changed
    * Plotly.js 1.43 converted `title` properties (e.g. `layout.title`) from
      trings into compound objects that contain the text as the `text` property
      long with new title placement attributes `x`, `y`, `xref`, `yref`, `xanchor`,
      yanchor` and `pad`. Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
      upports specifying `title` as a string, in which case the string is assigned
      o the `title.text` property
      [#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
    * Plotly.js 1.43 also moved existing `title*` properties
      e.g. `layout.titlefont`) under the `title` object (e.g. `layout.title.font`).
      lotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
      upports the legacy `title*` properties by mapping them to the corresponding
      title.*` property
      [#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
    * The `update` method on `graph_objs` now returns the updated object in order
      o support chaining multiple update operations together
      [#1379](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1379))
    * The `show_link` option has been set to `False` by default in the offline
      plot` and `iplot` functions. Now that the "send data to cloud" button has
      een disabled by default in plotly.js 1.43.0, no buttons/links will be
      isplayed by default that result in data being sent off of the local machine
      [#1304](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1304))
    * `config` options that are not known by plotly.py result in a warning but are
      till passed along to plotly.js. Prior to this change these unknown options
      ere dropped silently
      [#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
    * Built-in themes now specify colorscales using the new global
      layout.colorscale` properties.  Previously the colorscales were defined for
      ach trace type individually. This reduces the size of the resulting theme
      iles
      [#1303](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1303))
    * Increased the maximum retry time of the orca integration from 8s to 30s

      arge datasets, resulted in a slight freeze of the widget after user
      nteractions (pan, zoom, etc)
      [1305](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1305))
    * Fix orca error when the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable is set
      [#1293](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1293))
    * The `'responsive'` config key was being silently blocked
      [#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
    * Fixed error when using unicode characters in string properties on Python 2
      [#1289](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1289))
    * Removed invalid calls to non-existent `validate` and `strip_style` `Figure`
      ethods in matplotlylib conversion logic
      [#1128](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1128))
- Update to version 3.4.2
  + Fixed
    * `config` options are now supported when using `plotly.offline.iplot` to
      isplay a figure in JupyterLab. Requires version 0.18.1 of the
      @jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension.

- Update to version 3.3.0
  + Updated
    * Updated Plotly.js to version 1.41.3.  Select highlights included below, see
      the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1413----2018-09-25)
      or more information.
    * Do not create or check permissions on the `~/.plotly` configuration
      irectory until a configuration write operation is performed
      [#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195)). This change
      voids some concurrency problems associated with running many instances of
      lotly.py simultaneously
      [#1068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1068)).
  + Added
    * Enable selection by clicking on points via new layout attribute `clickmode` and flag `'select'`
      [#2944](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2944))
    * Added stacked area charts via new attributes `stackgroup` and `stackgaps` in scatter traces
      [#2960](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2960))
    * Added `barpolar` trace type - which replace and augment area traces
      [#2954](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2954))
    * Added `polar.hole` layout parameter to punch hole at the middle of polar
      ubplot offsetting the start of the radial range
      [#2977](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2977), [#2996](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2996))
    * Figures may now be easily converted to and from JSON using the new
      to_json`, `from_json`, `read_json`, and `write_json` functions in the
      plotly.io` package
      [#1188](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1188))
    * Figures and graph objects now support `deepcopy` and `pickle` operations
      [#1191](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1191))
    * The location of the `"~/.plotly"` settings directory may now be customized
      sing the `PLOTLY_DIR` environment variable
      [#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195))
    * Added optional `scaleratio` argument to the `create_quiver` figure factory.
      hen specified, the axes are restricted to this ratio and the quiver arrows
      re computed to have consistent lengths across angles.
      [#1197](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1197))
  + Fixed
    * Replace use of `pkg_resources.resource_string` with `pkgutil.get_data` to
      mprove compatibility with `cx_Freeze`
      [#1201](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1201))
    * An exception is no longer raised when an optional dependency raises an
      xception on import.  The exception is logged and plotly.py continues as if
      he dependency were not installed
      [#1192](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1192))
    * Fixed invalid dendrogram axis labels when the points being clustered contain
      uplicate values
      [#1186](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1186))
    * Added missing LICENSE.txt file to PyPI source distribution
      [#765](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/765))
  + JupyterLab Versions
    For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
    must be installed:
    * Python Packages
      > plotly==3.3.0
      > ipywidgets>=7.2
      > notebook>=5.3
      > jupyterlab==0.34
    * JupyterLab Extensions
      > plotlywidget@0.4.0
      > @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37
      > @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17
- Update to version 3.2.1
  This is a patch release that fixes a few bugs and reintroduces a few
  version 2 features that were not supported in version 3.
  The bundled version of plotly.js remains at 1.40.1
  + JupyterLab Versions
    For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
    must be installed:
    * Python Packages
      > plotly==3.2.1
      > ipywidgets>=7.2
      > notebook>=5.3
      > jupyterlab==0.34
    * JupyterLab Extensions
      > plotlywidget@0.3.0
      > @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37
      > @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17
  + Added
    * An optional `skip_invalid` argument has been added to the `Figure` and
      FigureWidget` constructors. By default, `skip_invalid` is `False` and invalid
      igure properties will result in an exception (this is identical to the
      revious behavior).  When `skip_invalid` is set to `True`, invalid properties
      ill instead be silently ignored. This argument replaces the `_raise`
      rgument that was available in version 2, and makes it possible to import
      igure definitions from different plotly versions, where incompatible
      roperties are ignored rather than causing an exception.
    * A `to_ordered_dict` method has been added to the `Figure` and `FigureWidget`
      lasses. This method returns a representation of the figure as a nested
      tructure of `OrdererdDict` and `list` instances where the keys in each
      OrderedDict` are sorted alphabetically.  This method replaces the
      get_ordered` method that was available in version 2, and makes it possible
      o traverse the nested structure of a figure in a deterministic order.
  + Fixed
    * Pandas `Series` and `Index` objects storing `datetime` values were
      incorrectly cast to numeric arrays
      ([plotly/plotly.py#1160](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1160),
      [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))
    * Numpy arrays with `uint64` datatype caused a `FigureWidget` error,
      and no figure was displayed
      ([plotly/plotly.py#1155](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1155),
      [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))
- Update to version 3.2.0
  This release introduces the long-anticipated ability to programmatically
  export figures as high quality static images in both raster and vector
  formats.
  + JupyterLab Versions (Python 3.5+)
    For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
    must be installed:

  + Added
    * plotly.js version 1.40.1, which introduces the following features:
      > Allow `contour`, `contourcarpet` and `histogram2dcontour` to have corresponding legend items using `showlegend`
         ([plotly/plotly.js#2891](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2891),
         [plotly/plotly.js#2914](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2914))
      > Add scatterpolar and scatterpolargl attributes `r0`, `dr`, `theta0` and `dtheta`
         ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))
      > Add layout attributes `piecolorway` and `extendpiecolors` for more control over pie colors
         ([plotly/plotly.js#2870](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
      > Add `splom` attribute `dimensions[i].axis.type` to easily override axis type in splom-generated axes
         ([plotly/plotly.js#2899](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
      > Add support for on-graph text in `scatterpolargl` traces
         ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))
      > See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1400----2018-08-16)

    * Support for offline static image export with the `to_image` and `write_image`
      functions in the new `plotly.io` package ([#1120](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1120)).
      > Note: Image export requires the plotly [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)
         command line utility and the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) Python package.
    * New documentation sections covering [Static Image Export](https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/)
      and [Orca Management](https://plot.ly/python/orca-management/)
    * Support for displaying `FigureWidget` instances in static contexts
      (e.g. [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)) just like the built-in ipywidgets
      [#1117](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1117))
    * Full integration of the Cividis colorscale ([#883](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/883))
    * conda packaging
      > From here forward, new versions of plotly.py will be published to the [plotly anaconda channel](https://anaconda.org/plotly/)
        on the same day they are published to PyPI.
        ([72ad0e4](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/commit/72ad0e4bf54bb8a06445d2ca55488ffc11c836a7))
      > The [`README`](README.md) now includes conda installation instructions alongside the pip instructions.
      > In addition to the existing installation approaches, orca is now also available as a
        [conda package](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca) from the plotly anaconda channel.
  + Updated
    * Show traces at the top of the Gantt chart's colorbar ([#1110](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1110))

  + Fixed
    * Validators for `dash` properties (e.g. `scatter.line.dash`) incorrectly rejected dash length lists ([#1136](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1136))
    * Annotated heatmap error when custom colorscale was specified ([#1151](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1151))
    * Incorrect deprecation warning for deprecated `plotly.graph_objs.Annotations` class ([#1138](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1138))

- Update to version 3.0.1 [YANKED]
  Note: This release's installation was broken. It has been removed from PyPI
- Update to version 3.0.0
  This is a major version with many exciting updates.
  + JupyterLab plotlywidget version: 0.1.1
  + Plotly.js version: 1.38.3
  + Added
    * Full Jupyter ipywidgets integration with the new `graph_objs.FigureWidget` class
    * `FigureWidget` figures can be updated interactively using property assignment syntax
    * The full trace and layout API is generated from the plotly schema to provide a great experience for interactive use in the notebook
    * Support for setting array properties as numpy arrays. When numpy arrays are used, ipywidgets binary serialization protocol is used to avoid converting these to JSON strings.
    * Context manager API for animation. Run `help(go.Figure().batch_animate)` for the full doc string.
    * Perform automatic retries when communicating with plot.ly services. This introduces a new required dependency on the [retrying](https://pypi.org/project/retrying/) library.
    * Improved data validation covering the full API with clear, informative error messages. This means that incorrect properties and/or values now always raise a `ValueError` with a description of the error, the invalid property, and the available properties on the level that it was placed in the graph object. Eg. `go.Scatter(foo=123)` raises a validation error. See https://plot.ly/python/reference/ for a reference to all valid properties and values in the Python API.
    * Error message for `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is now helpful to Anaconda users who do not have the correct modules installed for the County Choropleth figure factory.
  + Changed / Deprecated
