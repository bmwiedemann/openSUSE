Tue Feb  4 03:06:42 UTC 2025 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.4:
  * Removed:
    + Breaking change: support for Python 3.7 dropped totally.
      It was already dropped, but now it's official.
    + Breaking change (but for nobody): Invalid syntax removed.
      Removed syntax rules that were never implemented in graphviz's own
      parser.
    + Attribute sorting removed.
      Pydot will preserve the original order of attributes as defined.
    + Breaking change: Remove `.create_attribute_methods()` from classes.
      Setters and getters for attributes are now added to class definitions
      by calls to `pydot.core.__generate_attribute_methods()` immediately
      after the class is defined, for better compatibility with type-checking
      and introspection.
  * Changed:
    + Fixed quoting of identifiers with dots.
    + Fixed quoting of leading-numeral strings (strings starting with a
      number).
    + Fixed pickling/copying of Dot objects.
    + Improved handling of temporary files. Temporary files will be cleaned
      up in all cases, even when exceptions are raised or things exit
      unexpectedly.
    + From now on, the license files will be included in the distributed 
      release as expected.
    + Fix quoting in `Edge.to_string()`.
    + Internal storage and lookup of identifiers (names) improved.
      Pydot now always stores values as they were originally input, and only
      performs quoting on output.
    + Quoting for attribute values fixed.
      Attribute values containing comma-separated strings will now be quoted
      correctly.
  * Added:
    + All `to_string()` methods now accept an `indent` keyword argument,
      which can be either a number or a string. `indentation=4` will indent
      each level of the output with four spaces. `indentation="  "` will
      indent each level by that many spaces. Other whitespace is also
      valid, e.g. indent="\t" for tab indents.
    + Keywords can now be used as names or attribute values.
      Graphviz keywords like "graph" or "subgraph" will now be properly
      quoted when used as attribute values or as names, where appropriate.
    + Add standard Python logging, using the logger name `pydot`.
- Switch to using pytest to run the testsuite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 05:57:42 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Update to 2.0.0:
  * Changed:
    + Broken parsing caused by `pyparsing` updates fixed.
    + Reorganized package/module structure.
    + Reorganized exception hierarchy.
  * Deprecated:
    + Test suite option `--no-check`.
  * Removed:
    + Drop support for Python 2 and Python < 3.7.
- Drop patch pydot-skip-test.patch, no longer required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 11:09:47 UTC 2023 - ecsos <ecsos@opensuse.org>

- Add %{?sle15_python_module_pythons}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 07:42:07 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- skip failing tests 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 22 19:34:13 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.2:
  - Documentation: Basic usage examples in `README.md`. (#141)
  
  Changed:
  - More detailed error message in case of Graphviz errors. (#239)
  - More detailed warning message in case of failure to import the DOT
    parser module. (#241)
  
  Deprecated:
  - A future pydot 2.0.0 will drop support for Python 2, 3.4 and
    possibly other Python versions that are end-of-life at that time.
    Pydot does not emit any deprecation warnings about this. Further
    pydot 1.x.x releases are currently not foreseen, but if there are
    any, should still support the mentioned Python versions. (#229)
  
  Fixed:
  - On Python 2, non-equality comparison (`!=`) between two separate, but
    equal `Edge` instances will now correctly return `False`, as it
    already did on Python 3. (#248)
  - Prevent `TypeError` in handling of DOT parser error. (#176)
  - Prevent `TypeError` in `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()` and
    `graph_from_incidence_matrix()`. (#98)
  - Prevent `TypeError` when creating an edge with a `Subgraph` or
    `Cluster` object (as opposed to name string) as an edge point. (#89)
  - Windows only: Fixed most failures to find Graphviz when a conda or
    Anaconda installation exists, but Graphviz was installed manually or
    through pip (`.bat`/`.exe` suffix problem). (#205)
  - Windows only: Fixed failure to run Graphviz related to side-by-side
    assembly (SxS) by now propagating the `SYSTEMROOT` environment
    variable. (#208)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 25 08:02:25 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- We need the full graphviz-gd as otherwise it acts really weirdly

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 12:56:07 UTC 2019 - Colleen Murphy <comurphy@suse.com>

  *  Fix string formatting after catching error (#201)
  * Installation of pydot in conda env on Windows directly supported

  * Dropped Python 2.6 support (#185)

Wed Apr 19 16:15:07 UTC 2017 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Implement single-spec version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update source url
- Remove some obsolete parts of the spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  1 19:38:17 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2.3
  - support Python 2.6
  - several corrections
  - quote empty strings to avoid graphviz errors
- Update to 1.2.0
  - support Python 3
  - bumped dependency to `pyparsing >= 2.1.4`
  - tests running on Travis CI
  - tests require `chardet`
  - detect character encoding for most test files
    using the package `chardet`
  - API:
    + on all operating systems, search GraphViz
      executables in environment `$PATH`,
      using `subprocess.Popen`.
      No paths hard-coded due to security and privacy issues.
    + add option to pass GraphViz executable name
      or absolute path as `prog` to `pydot.Dot.write_*` methods.
      This provides an alternative to
      adding GraphViz to the `$PATH`.
    + the functions:
      * `pydot.graph_from_dot_data`
      * `pydot.graph_from_dot_file`
      * `dot_parser.parse_dot_data`
      changed to always return a `list` of graphs,
      instead of behaving differently for singletons.
    + require that the user explicitly give an encoding to
      the function `pydot.graph_from_dot_file`,
      with default encoding same as `io.open`.
    + decode to unicode at program boundaries, and
      treat binary images as bytes,
      for more compatibility with python 3.
      Use `io.open`, instead of the built-in `open`.
    + rm function `pydot.set_graphviz_executables`
    + rm attribute `pydot.Dot.progs`
- Update to 1.1.0
  - compatibility with `pyparsing >= 1.5.7`
  - API:
    + `pydot.Graph.to_string`: hide `subgraph` keyword only if so requested
    + produce `warnings.warn` if `pydot.dot_parser` fails to import,
      instead of `print`
- Update to 1.0.29
  - Maintenance release that keeps the same API
  - pin `pyparsing == 1.5.7`
  - update version number in source code
  - update `setup.py`
- Remove unneeded python-pydot-1.0.28_fix_pyparser_2_incompatibility.patch
- Remove out-of-date example files
