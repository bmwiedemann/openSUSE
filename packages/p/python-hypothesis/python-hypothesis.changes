Mon Jun 13 12:58:35 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 6.47.1
  * Our pretty-printer no longer sorts dictionary keys, since
    iteration order is stable in Python 3.7+ and this can affect
    reproducing examples (issue #3370). This PR was kindly
    supported by Ordina Pythoneers.
- Release 6.47.0
  * The Ghostwritter can now write tests for @classmethod or
    @staticmethod methods, in addition to the existing support for
    functions and other callables (issue #3318). Thanks to Cheuk
    Ting Ho for the patch.
- Release 6.46.11
  * Mention hypothesis.strategies.timezones() in the documentation
    of hypothesis.strategies.datetimes() for completeness.
  * Thanks to George Macon for this addition.
- Release 6.46.10
  * This release contains some small improvements to our
    documentation. Thanks to Felix Divo for his contribution!
- Release 6.46.9
  * This patch by Adrian Garcia Badaracco adds type annotations to
    some private internals (issue #3074).
- Release 6.46.8
  * This patch by Phillip Schanely makes changes to the floats()
    strategy when min_value or max_value is present. Hypothesis
    will now be capable of generating every representable value in
    the bounds. You may notice that hypothesis is more likely to
    test values near boundaries, and values that are very close to
    zero.
  * These changes also support future integrations with symbolic
    execution tools and fuzzers (issue #3086).
- Release 6.46.7
  * This patch updates the type annotations for tuples() and
    one_of() so that type-checkers require its arguments to be
    positional-only, and so that it no longer fails under
    pyright-strict mode (see issue #3348). Additional changes are
    made to Hypothesis’ internals improve pyright scans.
- Release 6.46.6
  * This patch by Cheuk Ting Ho adds support for PEP 655 Required
    and NotRequired as attributes of TypedDict in from_type()
    (issue #3339).
- Release 6.46.5
  * This patch fixes from_dtype() with long-precision
    floating-point datatypes (typecode g; see numpy.typename()).
- Release 6.46.4
  * This patch improves some error messages for custom signatures
    containing invalid parameter names (issue #3317).
- Release 6.46.3
  * This patch by Cheuk Ting Ho makes it an explicit error to call
    from_type() or register_type_strategy() with types that have no
    runtime instances (issue #3280).
- Release 6.46.2
  * This patch fixes silently dropping examples when the @example
    decorator is applied to itself (issue #3319). This was always a
    weird pattern, but now it works. Thanks to Ray Sogata, Keeri
    Tramm, and Kevin Khuong for working on this patch!
- Release 6.46.1
  * This patch fixes a rare bug where we could incorrectly treat
    empty as a type annotation, if the callable had an explicitly
    assigned __signature__.
- Release 6.46.0
  * This release adds an allow_nil argument to uuids(), which you
    can use to… generate the nil UUID. Thanks to Shlok Gandhi for
    the patch!
- Release 6.45.4
  * This patch fixes some missing imports for certain Ghostwritten
    tests. Thanks to Mel Seto for fixing issue #3316.
- Release 6.45.3
  * This patch teaches the Ghostwriter to recognize many more
    common argument names (issue #3311).
- Release 6.45.2
  * This patch fixes issue #3314, where Hypothesis would raise an
    internal error from domains() or (only on Windows) from
    timezones() in some rare circumstances where the installation
    was subtly broken.
  * Thanks to Munir Abdinur for this contribution.
- Release 6.45.1
  * This release fixes deprecation warnings about sre_compile and
    sre_parse imports and importlib.resources usage when running
    Hypothesis on Python 3.11.
  + Thanks to Florian Bruhin for this contribution.
- Release 6.45.0
  * This release updates xps.indices() by introducing an
    allow_newaxis argument, defaulting to False. If
    allow_newaxis=True, indices can be generated that add
    dimensions to arrays, which is achieved by the indexer
    containing None. This change is to support a specification
    change that expand dimensions via indexing
    (data-apis/array-api#408).
- Release 6.44.0
  * This release adds a names argument to indexes() and series(),
    so that you can create Pandas objects with specific or varied
    names.
  * Contributed by Sam Watts.
- Release 6.43.3
  * This patch updates the type annotations for @given so that
    type-checkers will warn on mixed positional and keyword
    arguments, as well as fixing issue #3296.
- Release 6.43.2
  * Fixed a type annotation for pyright --strict (issue #3287).
- Release 6.43.1
  * This patch makes it an explicit error to call
    register_type_strategy() with a Pydantic GenericModel and a
    callable, because GenericModel isn’t actually a generic type at
    runtime and so you have to register each of the “parametrized
    versions” (actually subclasses!) manually. See issue #2940 for
    more details.
- Release 6.43.0
  * This release makes it an explicit error to apply
    @pytest.fixture to a function which has already been decorated
    with @given(). Previously, pytest would convert your test to a
    fixture, and then never run it.
- Release 6.42.3
  * This patch fixes from_type() on a TypedDict with complex
    annotations, defined in a file using from __future__ import
    annotations. Thanks to Katelyn Gigante for identifying and
    fixing this bug!
- Release 6.42.2
  * The Hypothesis pytest plugin was not outputting valid xunit2
    nodes when --junit-xml was specified. This has been broken
    since Pytest 5.4, which changed the internal API for adding
    nodes to the junit report.
  * This also fixes the issue when using hypothesis with
    --junit-xml and pytest-xdist where the junit xml report would
    not be xunit2 compatible. Now, when using with pytest-xdist,
    the junit report will just omit the <properties> node.
  * For more details, see this pytest issue, this pytest issue, and
    issue #1935
  * Thanks to Brandon Chinn for this bug fix!
- Release 6.42.1
  * This patch fixes pretty-printing of regular expressions in
    Python 3.11.0a7, and updates our vendored list of top-level
    domains,.
- Release 6.42.0
  * This release makes st.functions(pure=True) less noisy (issue
    #3253), and generally improves pretty-printing of functions.
- Release 6.41.0
  * This release changes the implementation of infer to be an alias
    for Ellipsis. E.g. @given(a=infer) is now equivalent to
    @given(a=...). Furthermore, @given(...) can now be specified so
    that @given will infer the strategies for all arguments of the
    decorated function based on its annotations.
- Release 6.40.3
  * This patch simplifies the repr of the strategies namespace
    returned in make_strategies_namespace(), e.g.
      >>> from hypothesis.extra.array_api import make_strategies_namespace
      >>> from numpy import array_api as xp
      >>> xps = make_strategies_namespace(xp)
      >>> xps
      make_strategies_namespace(numpy.array_api)
- Release 6.40.2
  * Fixed from_type() support for PEP 604 union types, like int |
    None (issue #3255).
- Release 6.40.1
  * Fixed an internal error when given() was passed a lambda.
- Release 6.40.0
  * The Ghostwriter can now write tests which check that two or
    more functions are equivalent on valid inputs, or raise the
    same type of exception for invalid inputs (issue #3267).
- Release 6.39.6
  * This patch makes some quality-of-life improvements to the
    Ghostwriter: we guess the text() strategy for arguments named
    text (…obvious in hindsight, eh?); and improved the error
    message if you accidentally left in a nothing() or broke your
    rich install.
- Release 6.39.5
  * This patch improves our error detection and message when
    Hypothesis is run on a Python implementation without support
    for -0.0, which is required for the floats() strategy but can
    be disabled by unsafe compiler options (issue #3265).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 19 16:19:54 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 6.39.4
  * This patch tweaks some internal formatting. There is no
    user-visible change.
- Release 6.39.3
  * If the shrink phase is disabled, we now stop the generate phase
    as soon as an error is found regardless of the value of the
    report_multiple_examples setting, since that’s probably what
    you wanted (issue #3244).
- Release 6.39.2
  * This patch clarifies rare error messages in builds() (issue
    #3225) and floats() (issue #3207).
- Release 6.39.1
  * This patch fixes a regression where the bound inner function
    (your_test.hypothesis.inner_test) would be invoked with
    positional arguments rather than passing them by name, which
    broke pytest-asyncio (issue #3245).
- 6.39.0
  * This release improves Hypothesis’ handling of positional-only
    arguments, which are now allowed @st.composite strategies.
  * On Python 3.8 and later, the first arguments to builds() and
    from_model() are now natively positional-only. In cases which
    were already errors, the TypeError from incorrect usage will
    therefore be raises immediately when the function is called,
    rather than when the strategy object is used.
- Release 6.38.0
  * This release makes floats() error consistently when your
    floating-point hardware has been configured to violate IEEE-754
    for subnormal numbers, instead of only when an internal
    assertion was tripped (issue #3092).
  * If this happens to you, passing allow_subnormal=False will
    suppress the explicit error. However, we strongly recommend
    fixing the root cause by disabling global-effect unsafe-math
    compiler options instead, or at least consulting e.g. Simon
    Byrne’s Beware of fast-math explainer first.
- Release 6.37.2
  * This patch fixes a bug in stateful testing, where returning a
    single value wrapped in multiple() would be printed such that
    the assigned variable was a tuple rather than the single
    element (issue #3236).
- Release 6.37.1
  * This patch fixes a warning under pytest 7 relating to our rich
    traceback display logic (issue #3223).
- Release 6.37.0
  * When distinguishing multiple errors, Hypothesis now looks at
    the inner exceptions of PEP 654 ExceptionGroups.
- Release 6.36.2
  * This patch updates our vendored list of top-level domains,
    which is used by the provisional domains() strategy.
- Release 6.36.1
  * This patch fixes some deprecation warnings from pytest 7.0,
    along with some code formatting and docs updates.
- Release 6.36.0
  * This release disallows using typing.Final with from_type() and
    register_type_strategy().
  * Why? Because Final can only be used during class definition. We
    don’t generate class attributes.
  * It also does not make sense as a runtime type on its own.
- Release 6.35.1
  * This patch fixes hypothesis write output highlighting with rich
    version 12.0 and later.
- Drop importorskip-numpy-pandas.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 16:04:34 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Correct exclusion of test_recursion_error_is_not_flaky for 3.10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 16:47:37 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 6.35.0:
  - This release disallows using "typing.ClassVar" with
    "from_type()" and "register_type_strategy()". Why? Because
    "ClassVar" can only be used during "class" definition. We
    don't generate class attributes. It also does not make sense
    as a runtime type on its own.
  - Updates our vendored list of top-level domains, which is used
    by the provisional "domains()" strategy.
  - Fixes issue #3169, an extremely rare bug which would trigger
    if an internal least-recently-reused cache dropped a newly
    added entry immediately after it was added.
  - Fixes issue #3133 and issue #3144, where attempting to
    generate Pandas series of lists or sets would fail with
    confusing errors if you did not specify "dtype=object".
  - Disallows using "typing.TypeAlias" with "from_type()" and
    "register_type_strategy()". Why? Because "TypeAlias" is not
    really a type, it is a tag for type checkers that some
    expression is a type alias, not something else. It does not
    make sense for Hypothesis to resolve it as a strategy.
  - Updates our autoformatting tools, improving our code style
    without any API changes.
  - Drops support for Python 3.6, which reached end of life
    upstream on 2021-12-23.
  - Adds a temporary hook for a downstream tool, which is not
    part of the public API.
  - Updates our copyright headers to use a general authorship
    statement and omit the year.
- Skip also test_recursion_error_is_not_flaky
  (gh#HypothesisWorks/hypothesis#3035)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 12 11:40:54 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 6.31.4
  * This patch makes the .example() method more representative of
    test-time data generation, albeit often at a substantial cost
    to readability (issue #3182).
- Release 6.31.3
  * This patch improves annotations on some of Hypothesis’ internal
    functions, in order to deobfuscate the signatures of some
    strategies. In particular, strategies shared between
    hypothesis.extra.numpy and the hypothesis.extra.array_api extra
    will benefit from this patch.
- Release 6.31.2
  * This patch fix invariants display in stateful falsifying
    examples (issue #3185).
- Release 6.31.1
  * This patch updates xps.indices() so no flat indices are
    generated, i.e. generated indices will now always explicitly
    cover each axes of an array if no ellipsis is present. This is
    to be consistent with a specification change that dropped
    support for flat indexing (#272).
- Release 6.31.0
  * This release makes us compatible with Django 4.0, in particular
    by adding support for use of zoneinfo timezones (though we
    respect the new USE_DEPRECATED_PYTZ setting if you need it).
- Revert last mandatory requires update. Optional dependencies need
  to be declared by consuming packages (see hypothesis packaging
  doc)

- Update to 6.8.1
  * Full changelog since 5.41.2:
    https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html
- Changes in major version 6:
  * Many functions now use PEP 3102 keyword-only arguments where
    passing positional arguments was deprecated since 5.5.
  * hypothesis.extra.django.from_model() no longer accepts model
    as a keyword argument, where it could conflict with fields
    named “model”.
  * randoms() now defaults to use_true_random=False.
  * complex_numbers() no longer accepts min_magnitude=None; either
    use min_magnitude=0 or just omit the argument.
  * hypothesis.provisional.ip4_addr_strings and ip6_addr_strings
    are removed in favor of ip_addresses(v=...).map(str).
  * register_type_strategy() no longer accepts generic types with
    type arguments, which were always pretty badly broken.
  * Using function-scoped pytest fixtures is now a health-check
    error, instead of a warning.
- Don't test numpy and pandas for python36 (NEP29)
  * add distro specific importorskip-numpy-pandas.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 12 20:51:26 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 5.24.2
  * This release improves shrink quality by allowing Hypothesis to
    automatically learn new shrink passes for difficult to shrink
    tests.
  * The automatic learning is not currently accessible in user code
    (it still needs significant work on robustness and performance
    before it is ready for that), but this release includes learned
    passes that should improve shrinking quality for tests which
    use any of the text(), hypothesis.strategies.floats,
    hypothesis.strategies.datetimes, hypothesis.strategies.emails,
    and complex_numbers() strategies.
- Update to version 5.24.1
  * This patch updates some docstrings, without changing runtime
    behaviour. 
- add comment about source archive

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 12:28:11 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 5.24.0
  * The functions() strategy has a new argument pure=True, 
    which ensures that the same return value is generated 
    for identical calls to the generated function (issue 
    #2538).
  * Thanks to Zac Hatfield-Dodds and Nikita Sobolev for this 
    feature!
- Update to version 5.23.12
  * This release removes a number of Hypothesis's internal 
    "shrink passes" - transformations it makes to a 
    generated test case during shrinking - which appeared to 
    be redundant with other transformations.
  * It is unlikely that you will see much impact from this. 
    If you do, it will likely show up as a change in 
    shrinking performance (probably slower, maybe faster), 
    or possibly in worse shrunk results. If you encounter 
    the latter, please let us know.
- remove rpmlintrc again
- use only github source repository (python subdir) in obscpio

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  8 08:41:01 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Use PyPI source for package and test it with tests from the
  Github repository -- source hypothesis-python-tests-5.23.11 
  as direct CPIO archive hypothesis-python-tests-5.23.11.obscpio
  created by (locally run) obs_scm service
- Reenable django and pandas tests
- With ringdisabled, do not run test flavor at all
- Require and use pytest-xdist in tests
  * Reenables the one skipped test
  * Trims total build time by a large factor despite now running
    pandas and django tests too!
- Drop failing-test_array_values_are_unique_high_collision.patch
  * Fix the test instead gh#HypothesisWorks/hypothesis#2447    
- python-hypothesis-rpmlintrc -- filter empty types file
- Sync requirements versions to setup.py 
  * newer versions probably came from wrong interpretation of
    upstream's version pinning
- Update to version 5.23.11 
  * This release fixes a bug in some internal Hypothesis support 
    code. It has no user visible impact.    
- Update to version 5.23.10
  * This release improves the quality of shrunk test cases in some 
    special cases. Specifically, it should get shrinking unstuck in 
    some scenarios which require simultaneously changing two parts 
    of the generated test case.    
- Update to version 5.23.9
  * This release improves the performance of some internal support 
    code. It has no user visible impact, as that code is not 
    currently run during normal Hypothesis operation.
- Update to version 5.23.8
  * This release adds a heuristic to detect when shrinking has 
    finished despite the fact that there are many more possible 
    transformations to try. This will be particularly useful for 
    tests where the minimum failing test case is very large despite 
    there being many smaller test cases possible, where it is 
    likely to speed up shrinking dramatically.    
  * In some cases it is likely that this will result in worse 
    shrunk test cases. In those cases rerunning the test will 
    result in further shrinking.    
- Update to version 5.23.7
  * This release makes some performance improvements to shrinking. 
    They should only be noticeable for tests that are currently 
    particularly slow to shrink.
- Update to version 5.23.6
  * This patch adds some more internal functions to support a new 
    feature we're working on, like version 5.18.3. There is still 
    no user-visible changes yet.
- Update to version 5.23.5  
  * This release makes some changes to internal support code that 
    is not currently used in production Hypothesis. It has no user 
    visible effect at present.
- Update to version 5.23.4
  * This release improves shrinking quality in some special cases.
- Update to version 5.23.3  
  * This release fixes issue #2507, where lazy evaluation meant 
    that the values drawn from a sampled_from() strategy could 
    depend on mutations of the sampled sequence that happened after 
    the strategy was constructed.
- Update to version 5.23.2
  * This patch fixes issue #2462, a bug in our handling of 
    unittest.TestCase.subTest(). Thanks to Israel Fruchter for 
    fixing this at the EuroPython sprints!
- Update to version 5.23.1
  * This release improves the behaviour of the characters() 
    strategy when shrinking, by changing which characters are 
    considered smallest to prefer more "normal" ascii 
    characters where available.
- Update to version 5.23.0  
  * The default print_blob setting is now smarter. It defaults to 
    True in CI and False for local development.    
  * Thanks to Hugo van Kemenade for implementing this feature at 
    the EuroPython sprints!
- Update to version 5.22.0 
  * The slices() strategy can now generate slices for empty 
    sequences, slices with negative start and stop indices (from 
    the end of the sequence), and step=None in place of step=1.    
  * Thanks to Sangarshanan for implementing this feature at the 
    EuroPython sprints!
- Update to version 5.21.0   
  * This release ensures that tests which raise RecursionError are 
    not reported as flaky simply because we run them from different 
    initial stack depths (issue #2494).
- Update to version 5.20.4
  * This release improves the performance of the sample method on 
    objects obtained from randoms() when use_true_random=False. 
    This should mostly only be noticeable when the sample size is a 
    large fraction of the population size, but may also help avoid 
    health check failures in some other cases.
- Update to version 5.20.3
  * This release makes some internal changes for testing purposes 
    and should have no user visible effect.
- Update to version 5.20.2
  * This release fixes a small caching bug in Hypothesis internals 
    that may under some circumstances have resulted in a less 
    diverse set of test cases being generated than was intended.    
  * Fixing this problem revealed some performance problems that 
    could occur during targeted property based testing, so this 
    release also fixes those. Targeted property-based testing 
    should now be significantly faster in some cases, but this may 
    be at the cost of reduced effectiveness.
- Update to version 5.20.1
  * This patch updates our formatting to use isort 5. There is no 
    user-visible change.
- Update to version 5.20.0
  * The basic_indices() strategy can now generate bare indexers in 
    place of length-one tuples. Thanks to Andrea for this patch!
- Update to version 5.19.3
  * This patch removes an internal use of distutils in order to 
    avoid this setuptools warning for some users.
- Update to version 5.19.2
  * This patch contains a small internal refactoring with no 
    user-visible impact.  
    Thanks to Andrea for writing this at the SciPy 2020 Sprints!
- Update to version 5.19.1
  * This release slightly improves shrinking behaviour. This should 
    mainly only impact stateful tests, but may have some minor 
    positive impact on shrinking collections (lists, sets, etc).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 16:44:48 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 5.19.0:
  * This release improves the randoms() strategy by adding support
    for Random instances where Hypothesis generates the random
    values rather than having them be “truly” random.

- Update to version 5.18.3:
  * This patch adds some internal functions to support a new feature
    we’re working on. There is no user-visible change… yet.

- Update to version 5.18.2:
  * This patch improves our docs for the derandomize setting.

- Update to version 5.18.1:
  * This release consists of some internal refactoring to the shrinker
    in preparation for future work. It has no user visible impact.

- Update to version 5.18.0:
  * This release teaches Hypothesis to shorten tracebacks for explicit
    examples, as we already do for generated examples, so that you can
    focus on your code rather than ours.

  * If you have multiple failing explicit examples, they will now all
    be reported. To report only the first failure, you can use the
    report_multiple_bugs=False setting as for generated examples.

- Update to version 5.17.0:
  * This patch adds strategy inference for the Literal, NewType, Type,
    DefaultDict, and TypedDict types from the typing_extensions
    backport on PyPI.

- Update to version 5.16.3:
  * This patch precomputes some of the setup logic for our
    experimental external fuzzer integration and sets deadline=None
    in fuzzing mode, saving around 150us on each iteration.

  * This is around two-thirds the runtime to fuzz an empty test with
    @given(st.none()), and nice to have even as a much smaller
    fraction of the runtime for non-trivial tests.

- Update to version 5.16.2:
  * This patch fixes an internal error when warning about the use of
    function-scoped fixtures for parametrised tests where the
    parametrised value contained a % character.

- Update to version 5.16.1:
  * If you pass a list or tuple where a strategy was expected, the
    error message now mentions sampled_from() as an example strategy.

- Update to version 5.16.0:
  * functions() can now infer the appropriate returns strategy if you
    pass a like function with a return-type annotation. Before,
    omitting the returns argument would generate functions that
    always returned None.

- Update to version 5.15.1:
  * Fix from_type() with generic types under Python 3.9.

- Update to version 5.15.0:
  * This patch fixes an error that happens when multiple threads
    create new strategies.

- Update to version 5.14.0:
  * Passing min_magnitude=None to complex_numbers() is now deprecated.
    You can explicitly pass min_magnitude=0, or omit the argument entirely.

- Update to version 5.13.1:
  * This patch fixes an internal error in from_type() for
    typing.NamedTuple in Python 3.9.

- Update to version 5.13.0:
  * This release upgrades the test statistics available via
    the –hypothesis-show-statistics option to include separate
    information on each of the phases (issue #1555).

- Update to version 5.12.2:
  * This patch teaches the from_type() internals to return slightly
    more efficient strategies for some generic sets and mappings.

- Update to version 5.12.1:
  * This patch adds a # noqa comment for flake8 3.8.0, which
    disagrees with mypy about how to write the type of ....

- Update to version 5.12.0:
  * This release limits the maximum duration of the shrinking phase
    to five minutes, so that Hypothesis does not appear to hang when
    making very slow progress shrinking a failing example
    (issue #2340).

  * If one of your tests triggers this logic, we would really
    appreciate a bug report to help us improve the shrinker for
    difficult but realistic workloads.

- Add failing-test_array_values_are_unique_high_collision.patch
  to avoid failing test on i586 (gh#HypothesisWorks/hypothesis#2447)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  9 16:08:23 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 5.11.0:
  * This release improves the interaction between assume() and the
    @example() decorator, so that the following test no longer fails
    with UnsatisfiedAssumption (issue #2125):
        @given(value=floats(0, 1))
        @example(value=0.56789)  # used to make the test fail!
        @pytest.mark.parametrize("threshold", [0.5, 1])
        def test_foo(threshold, value):
            assume(value < threshold)
            ...

- changes from version 5.10.5 :
  * If you have django installed but don’t use it, this patch will
    make import hypothesis a few hundred milliseconds faster
    (e.g. 0.704s -> 0.271s).
    Thanks to importtime-waterfall for highlighting this problem and
    Jake Vanderplas for the solution - it’s impossible to misuse code
    from a module you haven’t imported!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 24 15:18:51 UTC 2020 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- specfile:
  * updated Django version number in requirements

- update to version 5.10.4:
  * This patch improves the internals of builds() type inference, to
    handle recursive forward references in certain dataclasses. This
    is useful for e.g. hypothesmith’s forthcoming LibCST mode.

- changes from version 5.10.3:
  * This release reverses the order in which some operations are tried
    during shrinking. This should generally be a slight performance
    improvement, but most tests are unlikely to notice much
    difference.

- changes from version 5.10.2:
  * This patch fixes issue #2406, where use of pandas.Timestamp
    objects as bounds for the datetimes() strategy caused an internal
    error. This bug was introduced in version 5.8.1.

- changes from version 5.10.1:
  * This release is a small internal refactoring to how shrinking
    interacts with targeted property-based testing that should have no
    user user visible impact.

- changes from version 5.10.0:
  * This release improves our support for datetimes and times around
    DST transitions.
  * times() and datetimes() are now sometimes generated with fold=1,
    indicating that they represent the second occurrence of a given
    wall-time when clocks are set backwards. This may be set even when
    there is no transition, in which case the fold value should be
    ignored.
    For consistency, timezones provided by the pytz package can now
    generate imaginary times (such as the hour skipped over when
    clocks ‘spring forward’ to daylight saving time, or during some
    historical timezone transitions). All other timezones have always
    supported generation of imaginary times.
    If you prefer the previous behaviour, datetimes() now takes an
    argument allow_imaginary which defaults to True but can be set to
    False for any timezones strategy.

- changes from version 5.9.1 :
  * This patch fixes the rendering of binary() docstring by using the
    proper backticks syntax.

- changes from version 5.9.0 :
  * Failing tests which use target() now report the highest score
    observed for each target alongside the failing example(s), even
    without explicitly showing test statistics.
  * This improves the debugging workflow for tests of accuracy, which
    assert that the total imprecision is within some error budget -
    for example, abs(a - b) < 0.5. Previously, shrinking to a minimal
    failing example could often make errors seem smaller or more
    subtle than they really are (see the threshold problem, and issue
    #2180).

- changes from version 5.8.6 :
  * This patch improves the docstring of binary(), the repr() of
    sampled_from() on an enum.Enum subclass, and a warning in our
    pytest plugin. There is no change in runtime behaviour.

- changes from version 5.8.5 :
  * This release (potentially very significantly) improves the
    performance of failing tests in some rare cases, mostly only
    relevant when using targeted property-based testing, by stopping
    further optimisation of unrelated test cases once a failing
    example is found.

- changes from version 5.8.4 :
  * This release fixes issue #2395, where under some circumstances
    targeted property-based testing could cause Hypothesis to get
    caught in an infinite loop.

- changes from version 5.8.3 :
  * This patch teaches builds() and from_type() to use the
    __signature__ attribute of classes where it has been set,
    improving our support for Pydantic models (in pydantic >= 1.5).

- changes from version 5.8.2 :
  * This release improves the performance of the part of the core
    engine that deliberately generates duplicate values.

- changes from version 5.8.1 :
  * This patch improves dates() shrinking, to simplify year, month,
    and day like datetimes() rather than minimizing the number of days
    since 2000-01-01.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  9 12:28:15 UTC 2020 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 5.8.0
  * Python2 finally dropped!
  * Many code fixups, removals, refactorings and so on.
  * No need for python-pytz
  * Drop support for Python 3.5
  * Just see hypothesis-python/docs/changes.rst

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 13 00:20:18 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.53.2:
  * This release reorganises a number of the Hypothesis internal
    modules into a package structure. If you are only depending on the
    public API it should have no effect. If you are depending on the
    internal API (which you shouldn’t be, and which we don’t guarantee
    compatibility on) you may have to rename some imports.

- changes from version 4.53.1:
  * This release changes the size distribution of the number of steps
    run in stateful testing: It will now almost always run the maximum
    number of steps permitted.

- changes from version 4.53.0:
  * Test Statistics now include the best score seen for each label,
    which can help avoid the threshold problem when the minimal
    example shrinks right down to the threshold of failure (issue
    #2180).

- changes from version 4.52.0:
  * This release changes the stateful_step_count setting to raise an
    error if set to 0. This is a backwards compatible change because a
    value of 0 would never have worked and attempting to run it would
    have resulted in an internal assertion error.

- changes from version 4.51.1:
  * This release makes a small internal change to the distribution of
    test cases. It is unlikely to have much user visible impact.

- changes from version 4.51.0:
  * This release deprecates use of @example, @seed, or
    @reproduce_failure without @given.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  7 17:43:19 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.50.8:
  * This patch makes certain uses of Bundles more efficient in
    stateful testing (issue #2078).

- changes from version 4.50.7:
  * This release refactors some of Hypothesis’s internal interfaces
    for representing data generation. It should have no user visible
    effect.

- changes from version 4.50.6:
  * This patch removes some old debugging helpers in our Numpy extra
    which have not been needed since issue #1963 and issue #2245.

- changes from version 4.50.5:
  * This patch fixes issue #2229, where Numpy arrays of unsized
    strings would only ever have strings of size one due to an
    interaction between our generation logic and Numpy’s allocation
    strategy.

- changes from version 4.50.4:
  * This patch fixes a rare internal error in strategies for a list of
    unique items sampled from a short non-unique sequence (issue
    #2247). The bug was discovered via hypothesis-jsonschema.

- changes from version 4.50.3:
  * This release improves the error message when @settings tries to
    inherit settings from a parent argument that isn’t a settings
    instance.

- changes from version 4.50.2:
  * This release improves Hypothesis’s “Falsifying example” output, by
    breaking output across multiple lines where necessary, and by
    removing irrelevant information from the stateful testing output.

- changes from version 4.50.1:
  * This patch adds flake8-comprehensions to our linter suite. There
    is no user-visible change - expect perhaps via some strange
    microbenchmarks - but certain parts of the code now have a clear
    and more consistent style.

- changes from version 4.50.0:
  * This release fixes some cases where we might previously have
    failed to run the validation logic for some strategies. As a
    result tests which would previously have been silently testing
    significantly less than they should may now start to raise
    InvalidArgument now that these errors are caught.

- changes from version 4.49.0:
  * This release significantly improves the data distribution in rule
    based stateful testing <stateful_testing>, by using a technique
    called Swarm Testing (Groce, Alex, et al. “Swarm testing.”
    Proceedings of the 2012 International Symposium on Software
    Testing and Analysis. ACM, 2012.) to select which rules are run in
    any given test case. This should allow it to find many issues that
    it would previously have missed.
  * This change is likely to be especially beneficial for stateful
    tests with large numbers of rules.

- changes from version 4.48.1:
  * This release adds some heuristics to test case generation that try
    to ensure that test cases generated early on will be relatively
    small.
  * This fixes a bug introduced in Hypothesis 4.42.0 which would cause
    occasional too_slow failures on some tests.

- changes from version 4.48.0:
  * This release revokes the deprecation of find, as we’ve now rebuilt
    it on top of @given, which means it has minimal maintenance burden
    and we’re happy to support it.

- changes from version 4.47.5:
  * This release rebuilds find() on top of @given in order to have
    more code in common. It should have minimal user visible effect.

- changes from version 4.47.4:
  * This patch removes an internal compatibility shim that we no
    longer need.

- changes from version 4.47.3:
  * This patch fixes several typos in our docstrings and comments,
    with no change in behaviour. Thanks to Dmitry Dygalo for
    identifying and fixing them!

- changes from version 4.47.2:
  * This release fixes an internal issue where Hypothesis would
    sometimes generate test cases that were above its intended maximum
    size. This would only have happened rarely and probably would not
    have caused major problems when it did.
  * Users of the new targeted property-based testing might see minor
    impact (possibly slightly faster tests and slightly worse target
    scores), but only in the unlikely event that they were hitting
    this problem. Other users should not see any effect at all.

- changes from version 4.47.1:
  * This release removes some unused code from the core engine. There
    is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.47.0:
  * This release commonizes some code between running explicit
    examples and normal test execution. The main user visible impact
    of this is that deadlines are now enforced when running explicit
    examples.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 23:59:44 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.46.1:
  * This patch ensures that a KeyboardInterrupt received during
    example generation is not treated as a mystery test failure but
    instead propagates to the top level, not recording the interrupted
    generation in the conjecture data tree. Thanks to Anne Archibald
    for identifying and fixing the problem.

- changes from version 4.46.0:
  * This release changes the behaviour of floats() when excluding
    signed zeros - floats(max_value=0.0, exclude_max=True) can no
    longer generate -0.0 nor the much rarer floats(min_value=-0.0,
    exclude_min=True) generate +0.0.
  * The correct interaction between signed zeros and exclusive
    endpoints was unclear; we now enforce the invariant that floats()
    will never generate a value equal to an excluded endpoint (issue
    #2201).
  * If you prefer the old behaviour, you can pass
    floats(max_value=-0.0) or floats(min_value=0.0) which is exactly
    equivalent and has not changed. If you had two endpoints equal to
    zero, we recommend clarifying your tests by using just() or
    sampled_from() instead of floats().

- changes from version 4.45.1:
  * This patch improves the error message when invalid arguments are
    passed to rule() or invariant() (issue #2149).
    Thanks to Benjamin Palmer for this bugfix!

- changes from version 4.45.0:
  * This release supports typing.Final and typing.TypedDict in
    from_type().

- changes from version 4.44.5:
  * This patch disables our pytest plugin when running on versions of
    pytest before 4.3, the oldest our plugin supports. Note that at
    time of writing the Pytest developers only support 4.6 and later!
  * Hypothesis tests using @given() work on any test runner, but our
    integrations to e.g. avoid example database collisions when
    combined with @pytest.mark.parametrize eventually drop support for
    obsolete versions.

- changes from version 4.44.4:
  * This patch adds some internal comments and clarifications to the
    Hypothesis implementation. There is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.44.3:
  * This patch avoids importing test runners such as :pypi`pytest`,
    :pypi`unittest2`, or :pypi`nose` solely to access their special
    “skip test” exception types - if the module is not in sys.modules,
    the exception can’t be raised anyway.
  * This fixes a problem where importing an otherwise unused module
    could cause spurious errors due to import-time side effects (and
    possibly -Werror).

- changes from version 4.44.2:
  * This release fixes @given to only complain about missing
    keyword-only arguments if the associated test function is actually
    called.
  * This matches the behaviour of other InvalidArgument errors
    produced by @given.

- changes from version 4.44.1:
  * This patch allows Hypothesis to run in environments that do not
    specify a __file__, such as a zipapp (issue #2196).

- changes from version 4.44.0:
  * This release adds a gufunc argument to
    mutually_broadcastable_shapes() (issue #2174), which allows us to
    generate shapes which are valid for functions like numpy.matmul
    that require shapes which are not simply broadcastable.
  * Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this feature over the
    last year, and a particular shout-out to Zac Hatfield-Dodds and
    Ryan Soklaski for mutually_broadcastable_shapes() and to Ryan
    Turner for the downstream hypothesis-gufunc project.

- changes from version 4.43.9:
  * This patch fixes issue #2108, where the first test using data() to
    draw from characters() or text() would be flaky due to unreliable
    test timings.
  * Time taken by lazy instantiation of strategies is now counted
    towards drawing from the strategy, rather than towards the
    deadline for the test function.

- changes from version 4.43.8:
  * This release ensures that the strategies passed to @given are
    properly validated when applied to a test method inside a test
    class.
  * This should result in clearer error messages when some of those
    strategies are invalid.

- changes from version 4.43.7:
  * This release changes how Hypothesis manages its search space in
    cases where it generates redundant data. This should cause it to
    generate significantly fewer duplicated examples (especially with
    short integer ranges), and may cause it to produce more useful
    examples in some cases (especially ones where there is a
    significant amount of filtering).

- changes from version 4.43.6 :
  * This patch refactors width handling in floats(); you may notice
    small performance improvements but the main purpose is to enable
    work on issue #1704 (improving shrinking of bounded floats).

- changes from version 4.43.5 :
  * This patch removes an unused internal flag. There is no
    user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.43.4:
  * This patch corrects the exception type and error message you get
    if you attempt to use data() to draw from something which is not a
    strategy. This never worked, but the error is more helpful now.

- changes from version 4.43.3:
  * We’ve adopted flake8-bugbear to check for a few more style issues,
    and this patch implements the minor internal cleanups it
    suggested. There is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.43.2:
  * This patch fixes the formatting of some documentation, but there
    is no change to any executed code.

- changes from version 4.43.1 :
  * Python 3.8’s new typing.Literal type - see PEP 586 for details -
    is now supported in from_type().

- changes from version 4.43.0:
  * This release adds the strategy mutually_broadcastable_shapes(),
    which generates multiple array shapes that are mutually
    broadcast-compatible with an optional user-specified base-shape.
  * This is a generalisation of broadcastable_shapes(). It relies
    heavily on non-public internals for performance when generating
    and shrinking examples. We intend to support generating shapes
    matching a ufunc signature in a future version (issue #2174).
  * Thanks to Ryan Soklaski, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, and @rdturnermtl who
    contributed to this new feature.

- changes from version 4.42.10:
  * This release fixes from_type() when used with bounded or
    constrained typing.TypeVar objects (issue #2094).
  * Previously, distinct typevars with the same constraints would be
    treated as all single typevar, and in cases where a typevar bound
    was resolved to a union of subclasses this could result in mixed
    types being generated for that typevar.

- changes from version 4.42.9:
  * This patch ensures that the default value broadcastable_shapes()
    chooses for max_dims is always valid (at most 32), even if you
    pass min_dims=32.

- changes from version 4.42.8:
  * This patch ensures that we only add profile information to the
    pytest header if running either pytest or Hypothesis in verbose
    mode, matching the builtin cache plugin (issue #2155).

- changes from version 4.42.7:
  * This patch makes stateful step printing expand the result of a
    step into multiple variables when you return multiple() (issue
    #2139). Thanks to Joseph Weston for reporting and fixing this bug!

- changes from version 4.42.6:
  * This release fixes a bug (issue #2166) where a Unicode character
    info cache file was generated but never used on subsequent test
    runs, causing tests to run more slowly than they should have.
  * Thanks to Robert Knight for this bugfix!

- changes from version 4.42.5:
  * This patch corrects some internal documentation. There is no
    user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.42.4:
  * This release fixes a bug (issue #2160) where decorators applied
    after @settings and before @given were ignored.
  * Thanks to Tom Milligan for this bugfix!

- changes from version 4.42.3:
  * This release updates Hypothesis’s formatting to the new version of
    black, and has absolutely no user visible effect.

- changes from version 4.42.2:
  * This release fixes a bug in recursive() which would have meant
    that in practice max_leaves was treated as if it was lower than it
    actually is - specifically it would be capped at the largest power
    of two smaller than it. It is now handled correctly.

- changes from version 4.42.1:
  * Python 3.8’s new typing.SupportsIndex type - see PEP 357 for
    details - is now supported in from_type().
  * Thanks to Grigorios Giannakopoulos for the patch!

- changes from version 4.42.0:
  * This release significantly simplifies Hypothesis’s internal logic
    for data generation, by removing a number of heuristics of
    questionable or unproven value.
  * The results of this change will vary significantly from test to
    test. Most test suites will see significantly faster data
    generation and lower memory usage. The “quality” of the generated
    data may go up or down depending on your particular test suites.
  * If you see any significant regressions in Hypothesis’s ability to
    find bugs in your code as a result of this release, please file an
    issue to let us know.
  * Users of the new targeted property-based testing functionality are
    reasonably likely to see improvements in data generation, as this
    release changes the search algorithm for targeted property based
    testing to one that is more likely to be productive than the
    existing approach.

- changes from version 4.41.3:
  * This patch is to ensure that our internals remain comprehensible
    to mypy 0.740 - there is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 4.41.2:
  * This patch changes some internal hashes to SHA384, to better
    support users subject to FIPS-140. There is no user-visible API
    change.
  * Thanks to Paul Kehrer for this contribution!

- changes from version 4.41.1:
  * This release makes --hypothesis-show-statistics much more useful
    for tests using a RuleBasedStateMachine, by simplifying the reprs
    so that events are aggregated correctly.

- changes from version 4.41.0:
  * This release upgrades the fixed_dictionaries() strategy to support
    optional keys (issue #1913).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 16 13:13:59 UTC 2019 - Marketa Calabkova <mcalabkova@suse.com>

- update to version 4.40.2
  * Type hints improved
  * Performance improved
  * Array indexing improved
  * **experimental** support for targeted property-based testing

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 25 17:57:25 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.34.0:
  * The from_type() strategy now knows to look up the subclasses of
    abstract types, which cannot be instantiated directly. This is
    very useful for hypothesmith to support libCST.

- changes from version 4.33.1:
  * This patch works around a crash when an incompatible version of
    Numpy is installed under PyPy 5.10 (Python 2.7).

- changes from version 4.33.0:
  * This release improves the domains() strategy, as well as the
    urls() and the emails() strategies which use it. These strategies
    now use the full IANA list of Top Level Domains and are correct as
    per RFC 1035. Passing tests using these strategies may now
    fail.Thanks to TechDragon for this improvement.

- changes from version 4.32.3 :
  * This patch tidies up the repr of several settings-related objects,
    at runtime and in the documentation, and deprecates the
    undocumented edge case that phases=None was treated like
    phases=tuple(Phase). It also fixes from_lark() with lark 0.7.2 and later.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  4 15:07:54 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.32.2:
  * This patch updates some internal comments for mypy 0.720. There is
    no user-visible impact.

- changes from version 4.32.1:
  * This release changes how the shrinker represents its progress
    internally. For large generated test cases this should result in
    significantly less memory usage and possibly faster
    shrinking. Small generated test cases may be slightly slower to
    shrink but this shouldn’t be very noticeable.

- changes from version 4.32.0:
  * This release makes arrays() more pedantic about elements
    strategies that cannot be exactly represented as array
    elements. In practice, you will see new warnings if you were using
    a float16 or float32 dtype without passing floats() the width=16
    or width=32 arguments respectively.The previous behaviour could
    lead to silent truncation, and thus some elements being equal to
    an explicitly excluded bound (issue #1899).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 28 16:16:49 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.31.1:
  * This patch changes an internal use of MD5 to SHA hashes, to better
    support users subject to FIPS-140. There is no user-visible or API
    change.

- changes from version 4.31.0 :
  * This release simplifies the logic of the print_blob setting by
    removing the option to set it to PrintSettings.INFER. As a result
    the print_blob setting now takes a single boolean value, and the
    use of PrintSettings is deprecated.

Mon Jul 22 13:00:16 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 4.28.2:
  * Various bugfixes and deprecations all around

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  8 23:18:22 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.24.3:
  * This patch improves the implementation of an internal wrapper on
    Python 3.8 beta1 (and will break on the alphas; but they’re not
    meant to be stable). On other versions, there is no change at
    all. Thanks to Daniel Hahler for the patch, and Victor Stinner for
    his work on bpo-37032 that made it possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 09:01:21 UTC 2019 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 4.24.2
 * Deprecation messages for functions in hypothesis.extra.django.models
   now explicitly name the deprecated function to make it easier to track down usages. 
 * a spurious bug raised when a @st.composite function was passed a keyword-only argument.
 * deprecates GenericStateMachine, in favor of RuleBasedStateMachine.
 * This patch clarifies some error messages when the test function signature
   is incompatible with the arguments to @given, especially when the @settings()
   decorator is also used
 * ixes a minor formatting issue the docstring of from_type()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 14 11:05:16 UTC 2019 - Ondřej Súkup <mimi.vx@gmail.com>

- update to 4.23.4
  * Adds a recipe to the docstring of :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.from_type`
  * implements the :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.slices` strategy,
     to generate slices of a length-size sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  7 08:58:44 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Remove pandas dependency to make ring1 more happy
- Update to 4.22.0:
  * Various small tweaks only

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 09:40:28 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- More love for the tests to make sure we execute and run them
  + skip/remove the obvious failures that are irelevant

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 13:01:05 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 4.18.2:
  * This patch makes Hypothesis compatible with the Python 3.8 alpha
  * This release adds the functions() strategy
  * This release refactors stateful rule selection
  * This patch allows Hypothesis to try a few more examples after finding the first bug
  * This release adds the strategy broadcastable_shapes()
- Make sure the tests are executed (and fail at the moment, needs
  bit more love)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 13 03:07:02 UTC 2019 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 4.16.0:
  * This release allows register_type_strategy() to be used with
    typing.NewType instances. This may be useful to e.g. provide only
    positive integers for from_type(UserId) with a UserId =
    NewType('UserId', int) type.

- changes from version 4.15.0:
  * This release supports passing a timedelta as the deadline setting,
    so you no longer have to remember that the number is in
    milliseconds (issue #1900).

- changes from version 4.14.7:
  * This patch makes the type annotations on hypothesis.extra.dateutil
    compatible with mypy 0.700.

- changes from version 4.14.6:
  * This release fixes a bug introduced in Hypothesis 4.14.3 that
    would sometimes cause sampled_from(...).filter(...) to encounter
    an internal assertion failure when there are three or fewer
    elements, and every element is rejected by the filter.

- changes from version 4.14.5:
  * This patch takes the previous efficiency improvements to
    sampled_from(...).filter(...) strategies that reject most
    elements, and generalises them to also apply to
    sampled_from(...).filter(...).filter(...) and longer chains of
    filters.

- changes from version 4.14.4:
  * This release fixes a bug that prevented random_module() from
    correctly restoring the previous state of the random module.
    The random state was instead being restored to a temporary
    deterministic state, which accidentally caused subsequent tests to
    see the same random values across multiple test runs.

- changes from version 4.14.3:
  * This patch adds an internal special case to make
    sampled_from(...).filter(...) much more efficient when the filter
    rejects most elements (issue #1885).

- changes from version 4.14.2:
  * This patch improves the error message if the function f in
    s.flatmap(f) does not return a strategy.

- changes from version 4.14.1:
  * This release modifies how Hypothesis selects operations to run
    during shrinking, by causing it to deprioritise previously useless
    classes of shrink until others have reached a fixed point.
  * This avoids certain pathological cases where the shrinker gets
    very close to finishing and then takes a very long time to finish
    the last small changes because it tries many useless shrinks for
    each useful one towards the end. It also should cause a more
    modest improvement (probably no more than about 30%) in shrinking
    performance for most tests.

- changes from version 4.14.0:
  * This release blocks installation of Hypothesis on Python 3.4,
    which reached its end of life date on 2019-03-18.
    This should not be of interest to anyone but downstream
    maintainers - if you are affected, migrate to a secure version of
    Python as soon as possible or at least seek commercial support.

Sat Dec  8 19:35:13 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.82.5:
  * This patch fixes issue #1667, where passing bounds of Numpy dtype
    int64 to integers() could cause errors on Python 3 due to internal
    rounding.

- changes from version 3.82.4:
  * Hypothesis now seeds and resets the global state of np.random for
    each test case, to ensure that tests are reproducible.
  * This matches and complements the existing handling of the random
    module - Numpy simply maintains an independent PRNG for
    performance reasons.

- changes from version 3.82.3 :
  * This is a no-op release to add the new Framework :: Hypothesis
    trove classifier to hypothesis on PyPI.
  * You can use it as a filter to find Hypothesis-related packages
    such as extensions as they add the tag over the coming weeks, or
    simply visit our curated list.

- changes from version 3.82.2 :
  * The Hypothesis for Pandas extension is now listed in setup.py, so
    you can pip install hypothesis[pandas].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  1 22:43:45 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.82.1:
  * This patch fixes from_type() on Python 2 for classes where
    cls.__init__ is object.__init__. Thanks to ccxcz for reporting
    issue #1656.

- changes from version 3.82.0:
  * The alphabet argument for text() now uses its default value of
    characters(blacklist_categories=('Cs',)) directly, instead of
    hiding that behind alphabet=None and replacing it within the
    function. Passing None is therefore deprecated.

- changes from version 3.81.0:
  * GenericStateMachine and RuleBasedStateMachine now raise an
    explicit error when instances of settings are assigned to the
    classes’ settings attribute, which is a no-op (issue
    #1643). Instead assign to SomeStateMachine.TestCase.settings, or
    use @settings(...) as a class decorator to handle this
    automatically.

- changes from version 3.80.0:
  * Since version 3.68.0, arrays() checks that values drawn from the
    elements and fill strategies can be safely cast to the dtype of
    the array, and emits a warning otherwise.
    This release expands the checks to cover overflow for finite
    complex64 elements and string truncation caused by too-long
    elements or trailing null characters (issue #1591).

- changes from version 3.79.4:
  * Tests using @given now shrink errors raised from pytest helper
    functions, instead of reporting the first example found.
    This was previously fixed in version 3.56.0, but only for stateful
    testing.

- changes from version 3.79.3:
  * Traceback elision is now disabled on Python 2, to avoid an
    import-time SyntaxError under Python < 2.7.9 (Python: bpo-21591,
    Hypothesis 3.79.2: issue #1648).
  * We encourage all users to upgrade to Python 3 before the end of
    2019.

- changes from version 3.79.2:
  * This patch shortens tracebacks from Hypothesis, so you can see
    exactly happened in your code without having to skip over
    irrelevant details about our internals (issue #848).
    In the example test (see pull request #1582), this reduces
    tracebacks from nine frames to just three - and for a test with
    multiple errors, from seven frames per error to just one!
    If you do want to see the internal details, you can disable frame
    elision by setting verbosity to debug.

- changes from version 3.79.1:
  * The abstract number classes Number, Complex, Real, Rational, and
    Integral are now supported by the from_type()
    strategy. Previously, you would have to use
    register_type_strategy() before they could be resolved (issue
    #1636)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 20 15:34:34 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.79.0:
  * This release adds a CLI flag for verbosity --hypothesis-verbosity
    to the Hypothesis pytest plugin, applied after loading the profile
    specified by --hypothesis-profile. Valid options are the names of
    verbosity settings, quiet, normal, verbose or debug.Thanks to Bex
    Dunn for writing this patch at the PyCon Australia sprints!
  * The pytest header now correctly reports the current profile if
    --hypothesis-profile has been used. Thanks to Mathieu Paturel for t
    he contribution at the Canberra Python Hacktoberfest.

- changes from version 3.78.0:
  * This release has deprecated the generation of integers, floats and
    fractions when the conversion of the upper and/ or lower bound is
    not 100% exact, e.g. when an integer gets passed a bound that is
    not a whole number. (issue #1625)

- changes from version 3.77.0:
  * This minor release adds functionality to settings allowing it to
    be used as a decorator on RuleBasedStateMachine and
    GenericStateMachine.

- changes from version 3.76.1:
  * This patch fixes some warnings added by recent releases of
    pydocstyle and mypy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 14 15:26:36 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.76.0:
  * This release deprecates using floats for min_size and max_size.
  * The type hint for average_size arguments has been changed from
    Optional[int] to None, because non-None values are always ignored
    and deprecated.

- changes from version 3.75.4:
  * This patch adds more internal comments to the core engine’s
    sequence-length shrinker. There should be no user-visible change.

- changes from version 3.75.3:
  * This patch adds additional comments to some of the core engine’s
    internal data structures. There is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 3.75.2:
  * This patch avoids caching a trivial case, fixing issue #493.

- changes from version 3.75.1:
  * This patch fixes a broken link in a docstring. Thanks to Benjamin
    Lee for this contribution!

- changes from version 3.75.0:
  * This release deprecates the use of min_size=None, setting the
    default min_size to 0 (:issue: 1618).

- changes from version 3.74.3:
  * This patch makes some small internal changes to comply with a new
    lint setting in the build. There should be no user-visible change.

- changes from version 3.74.2:
  * This patch fixes issue #1153, where time spent reifying a strategy
    was also counted in the time spent generating the first
    example. Strategies are now fully constructed and validated before
    the timer is started.

- changes from version 3.74.1:
  * This patch fixes some broken formatting and links in the
    documentation.

- changes from version 3.74.0:
  * This release checks that the value of the print_blob setting is a
    PrintSettings instance.
  * Being able to specify a boolean value was not intended, and is now
    deprecated. In addition, specifying True will now cause the blob
    to always be printed, instead of causing it to be suppressed.
  * Specifying any value that is not a PrintSettings or a boolean is
    now an error.

- changes from version 3.73.5:
  * Changes the documentation for hypothesis.strategies.datetimes,
    hypothesis.strategies.dates, hypothesis.strategies.times to use
    the new parameter names min_value and max_value instead of the
    deprecated names

- changes from version 3.73.4:
  * This patch ensures that Hypothesis deprecation warnings display
    the code that emitted them when you’re not running in -Werror mode
    (issue #652).

- changes from version 3.73.3:
  * Tracebacks involving @composite are now slightly shorter due to
    some internal refactoring.

- changes from version 3.73.2:
  * This patch fixes errors in the internal comments for one of the
    shrinker passes. There is no user-visible change.

- changes from version 3.73.1:
  * This patch substantially improves the distribution of data
    generated with recursive(), and fixes a rare internal error (issue
    #1502).

- changes from version 3.73.0 :
  * This release adds the fulfill() function, which is designed for
    testing code that uses dpcontracts 0.4 or later for input
    validation. This provides some syntactic sugar around use of
    assume(), to automatically filter out and retry calls that cause a
    precondition check to fail (issue #1474).

- changes from version 3.72.0 :
  * This release makes setting attributes of the hypothesis.settings
    class an explicit error. This has never had any effect, but could
    mislead users who confused it with the current settings instance
    hypothesis.settings.default (which is also immutable). You can
    change the global settings with settings profiles.

- changes from version 3.71.11:
  * This patch factors out some common code in the shrinker for
    iterating over pairs of data blocks. There should be no
    user-visible change.

- changes from version 3.71.10 :
  * This patch allows from_type() to handle the empty tuple type,
    typing.Tuple[()].

- changes from version 3.71.9 :
  * This patch updates some internal comments for mypy. There is no
    user-visible effect, even for Mypy users.

- changes from version 3.71.8:
  * This patch fixes a rare bug that would cause a particular shrinker
    pass to raise an IndexError, if a shrink improvement changed the
    underlying data in an unexpected way.

- changes from version 3.71.7:
  * This release fixes the broken cross-references in our docs, and
    adds a CI check so we don’t add new ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 16 15:37:43 UTC 2018 - Arun Persaud <arun@gmx.de>

- update to version 3.71.6:
  * This patch fixes two bugs (issue #944 and issue #1521), where
    messages about @seed <hypothesis.seed() did not check the current
    verbosity setting, and the wrong settings were active while
    executing explicit examples.

- changes from version 3.71.5:
  * This patch fixes a DeprecationWarning added in Python 3.8 (issue
    #1576).
  * Thanks to tirkarthi for this contribution!

- changes from version 3.71.4:
  * This is a no-op release, which implements automatic DOI minting
    and code archival of Hypothesis via Zenodo. Thanks to CERN and the
    EU Horizon 2020 programme for providing this service!
  * Check our CITATION file for details, or head right on over to
    doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1412597

- changes from version 3.71.3:
  * This release adds the test name to some deprecation warnings, for
    easier debugging.
  * Thanks to Sanyam Khurana for the patch!

- changes from version 3.71.2:
  * This release makes Hypothesis’s memory usage substantially smaller
    for tests with many examples, by bounding the number of past
    examples it keeps around.
  * You will not see much difference unless you are running tests with
    max_examples set to well over 1000, but if you do have such tests
    then you should see memory usage mostly plateau where previously
    it would have grown linearly with time.

- changes from version 3.71.1:
  * This patch adds internal comments to some tree traversals in the
    core engine. There is no user-visible change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 05:25:06 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.66.6:
  * This patch ensures that Hypothesis fully supports Python 3.7, by
    upgrading from_type() (issue #1264) and fixing some minor issues
    in our test suite (issue #1148).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 22 18:47:08 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.66.5:
  * This patch fixes the online docs for various extras, by ensuring
    that their dependencies are installed on readthedocs.io (issue
    #1326).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 20 15:28:09 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.66.4:
  * This release improves the shrinker’s ability to reorder examples.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 12 15:59:06 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.66.1:
  * This patch fixes a rare bug where an incorrect percentage drawtime
    could be displayed for a test, when the system clock was changed
    during a test running under Python 2 (we use time.monotonic()
    where it is available to avoid such problems). It also fixes a
    possible zero-division error that can occur when the underlying C
    library double-rounds an intermediate value in math.fsum() and
    gets the least significant bit wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  7 17:11:59 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.66.0:
  * This release improves validation of the alphabet argument to the
    text() strategy. The following misuses are now deprecated, and
    will be an error in a future version:
    + passing an unordered collection (such as set('abc')), which
      violates invariants about shrinking and reproducibility
    + passing an alphabet sequence with elements that are not strings
    + passing an alphabet sequence with elements that are not of
      length one, which violates any size constraints that may apply

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  6 11:58:50 UTC 2018 - dmueller@suse.com

- remove redundant pythons buildrequire

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  1 17:47:50 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * be more specific for %{python_sitelib} in %files

- update to version 3.65.0:
  * This release deprecates the max_shrinks setting in favor of an
    internal heuristic. If you need to avoid shrinking examples, use
    the phases setting instead. (issue #1235)

- changes from version 3.64.2:
  * This release fixes a bug where an internal assertion error could
    sometimes be triggered while shrinking a failing test.

- changes from version 3.64.1:
  * This patch fixes type-checking errors in our vendored
    prety-printer, which were ignored by our mypy config but visible
    for anyone else (whoops). Thanks to Pi Delport for reporting issue
    #1359 so promptly.

- changes from version 3.64.0:
  * This release adds an interface which can be used to insert a
    wrapper between the original test function and @given (issue
    #1257). This will be particularly useful for test runner
    extensions such as pytest-trio, but is not recommended for direct
    use by other users of Hypothesis.

- changes from version 3.63.0:
  * This release adds a new mechanism to infer strategies for classes
    defined using attrs, based on the the type, converter, or
    validator of each attribute. This inference is now built in to
    builds() and from_type().
  * On Python 2, from_type() no longer generates instances of int when
    passed long, or vice-versa.

- changes from version 3.62.0:
  * This release adds PEP 484 type hints to Hypothesis on a
    provisional basis, using the comment-based syntax for Python 2
    compatibility. You can read more about our type hints here.
  * It also adds the py.typed marker specified in PEP 561. After you
    pip install hypothesis, mypy 0.590 or later will therefore
    type-check your use of our public interface!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 24 15:40:53 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * use %{version} in source

- update to version 3.61.0:
  * This release deprecates the use of settings as a context manager,
    the use of which is somewhat ambiguous.Users should define
    settings with global state or with the @settings(...) decorator.

- changes from version 3.60.1:
  * Fixed a bug in generating an instance of a Django model from a
    strategy where the primary key is generated as part of the
    strategy. See details here.

- changes from version 3.60.0:
  * This release add initialize decorator for stateful testing
    (originally discussed in issue #1216). initialize act as a special
    rule that is only called once, and all initialize rules are
    guaranteed to be called before any normal rule is called.

- changes from version 3.59.3:
  * This is a no-op release to take into account some changes to the
    release process. It should have no user visible effect.

- changes from version 3.59.2:
  * This adds support for partially sorting examples which cannot be
    fully sorted. For example, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] with a constraint
    that the first element needs to be larger than the last becomes
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0].

- changes from version 3.59.1:
  * This patch uses random.getstate() and random.setstate() to restore
    the PRNG state after @given runs deterministic tests. Without
    restoring state, you might have noticed problems such as issue
    #1266. The fix also applies to stateful testing (issue #702).

- changes from version 3.59.0:
  * This release adds the emails() strategy, which generates unicode
    strings representing an email address.

- changes from version 3.58.1:
  * This improves the shrinker. It can now reorder examples: 3 1 2
    becomes 1 2 3.

- changes from version 3.58.0:
  * This adds a new extra timezones() strategy that generates dateutil
    timezones. Depends on python-dateutil.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  4 19:27:19 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Use github source archive as recommended by upstream.
- Remove unneeded python-hypothesis-build.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 31 02:56:55 UTC 2018 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 3.57.0
  * Using an unordered collection with the :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.permutations`
    strategy has been deprecated because the order in which e.g. a set shrinks is
    arbitrary. This may cause different results between runs.
- Update to 3.56.10 - 2018-05-16
  * This release makes :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.define_setting`
    aprivate method, which has the effect of hiding it from the
    documentation.
- Update to 3.56.9
  * This is another release with no functionality changes as part of changes to
    Hypothesis's new release tagging scheme.
- Update to 3.56.8
  * This is a release with no functionality changes that moves Hypothesis over to
    anew release tagging scheme.
- Update to 3.56.7
  * This release provides a performance improvement for most tests, but in
    particular users of ``sampled_from`` who don't have numpy installed should see
    asignificant performance improvement.
- Update to 3.56.6
  * This patch contains further internal work to support Mypy.
    There are no user-visible changes... yet.
- Update to 3.56.5
  * This patch contains some internal refactoring to run :pypi:`mypy` in CI.
    There are no user-visible changes.
- Update to 3.56.4
  * This release involves some very minor internal clean up and should have no
    user visible effect at all.
- Update to 3.56.3
  * This release fixes a problem introduced in :ref:`3.56.0 <v3.56.0>` where
    setting the hypothesis home directory (through currently undocumented
    means) would no longer result in the default database location living
    in the new home directory.
- Update to 3.56.2
  * This release fixes a problem introduced in :ref:`3.56.0 <v3.56.0>` where
    setting :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.max_examples` to ``1`` would result in tests
    failing with ``Unsatisfiable``. This problem could also occur in other harder
    to trigger circumstances (e.g. by setting it to a low value, having a hard to
    satisfy assumption, and disabling health checks).
- Update to 3.56.1
  * This release fixes a problem that was introduced in :ref:`3.56.0 <v3.56.0>`:
    Use of the :envvar:`HYPOTHESIS_VERBOSITY_LEVEL` environment variable was, rather
    than deprecated, actually broken due to being read before various setup
    the deprecation path needed was done. It now works correctly (and emits a
    deprecation warning).
- Update to 3.56.0
  * This release deprecates several redundant or internally oriented
    :class:`~hypothesis.settings`, working towards an orthogonal set of
    configuration options that are widely useful *without* requiring any
    knowledge of our internals (:issue:`535`).
    + Deprecated settings that no longer have any effect are no longer
      shown in the ``__repr__`` unless set to a non-default value.
    + :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.perform_health_check` is deprecated, as it
      duplicates :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.suppress_health_check`.
    + :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.max_iterations` is deprecated and disabled,
      because we can usually get better behaviour from an internal heuristic
      than a user-controlled setting.
    + :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.min_satisfying_examples` is deprecated and
      disabled, due to overlap with the
      :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.HealthCheck.filter_too_much` healthcheck
      and poor interaction with :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.max_examples`.
    + :envvar:`HYPOTHESIS_VERBOSITY_LEVEL` is now deprecated.  Set
      :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.verbosity` through the profile system instead.
    + Examples tried by :func:`~hypothesis.find` are now reported at ``debug``
      verbosity level (as well as ``verbose`` level).
- Update to 3.55.6
  * This release fixes a somewhat obscure condition (:issue:`1230`) under which you
    could occasionally see a failing test trigger an assertion error inside
    Hypothesis instead of failing normally.
- Update to 3.55.5
  * This patch fixes one possible cause of :issue:`966`.  When running
    Python 2 with hash randomisation, passing a :obj:`python:bytes` object
    to :func:`python:random.seed` would use ``version=1``, which broke
    :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.derandomize` (because the seed depended on
    arandomised hash).  If :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.derandomize` is
    *still* nondeterministic for you, please open an issue.
- Update to 3.55.4
  * This patch makes a variety of minor improvements to the documentation,
    and improves a few validation messages for invalid inputs.
- Update to 3.55.3
  * This release updates the URL metadata associated with the PyPI package (again).
    It has no other user visible effects.
- Update to 3.55.2
  * This release updates the URL metadata associated with the PyPI package.
    It has no other user visible effects.
- Update to 3.55.1
  * This patch relaxes constraints on the expected values returned
    by the standard library function :func:`hypot` and the internal
    helper function :func:`~hypotheses.internal.cathetus`, this to
    fix near-exact test-failures on some 32-bit systems.
- Update to 3.55.0
  * This release includes several improvements to the handling of the
    :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.database` setting.
    + The :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.database_file` setting was a historical
      artefact, and you should just use :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.database`
      directly.
    + The :envvar:`HYPOTHESIS_DATABASE_FILE` environment variable is
      deprecated, in favor of :meth:`~hypothesis.settings.load_profile` and
      the :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.database` setting.
    + If you have not configured the example database at all and the default
      location is not usable (due to e.g. permissions issues), Hypothesis
      will fall back to an in-memory database.  This is not persisted between
      sessions, but means that the defaults work on read-only filesystems.
- Update to 3.54.0
  * This release improves the :func:`~hypotheses.strategies.complex_numbers`
    strategy, which now supports ``min_magnitude`` and ``max_magnitude``
    arguments, along with ``allow_nan`` and ``allow_infinity`` like for
    :func:`~hypotheses.strategies.floats`.
    Thanks to J.J. Green for this feature.
- Update to 3.53.0
  * This release removes support for Django 1.8, which reached end of life on
    2018-04-01.  You can see Django's release and support schedule
    `on the Django Project website <https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions>`_.
- Update to 3.52.3
  * This patch fixes the :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.min_satisfying_examples` settings
    documentation, by explaining that example shrinking is tracked at the level
    of the underlying bytestream rather than the output value.
  * The output from :func:`~hypothesis.find` in verbose mode has also been
    adjusted - see :ref:`the example session <verbose-output>` - to avoid
    duplicating lines when the example repr is constant, even if the underlying
    representation has been shrunken.
- Update to 3.52.2
  * This release improves the output of failures with
    :ref:`rule based stateful testing <rulebasedstateful>` in two ways:
     The output from it is now usually valid Python code.
     When the same value has two different names because it belongs to two different
     bundles, it will now display with the name associated with the correct bundle
     for a rule argument where it is used.
- Update to 3.52.1
  * This release improves the behaviour of  :doc:`stateful testing <stateful>`
    in two ways:
    Previously some runs would run no steps (:issue:`376`). This should no longer
    happen.
    RuleBasedStateMachine tests which used bundles extensively would often shrink
    terribly. This should now be significantly improved, though there is likely
    a lot more room for improvement.
  * This release also involves a low level change to how ranges of integers are
    handles which may result in other improvements to shrink quality in some cases.
- Update to 3.52.0
  * This release deprecates use of :func:`@settings(...) <hypothesis.settings>`
    as a decorator, on functions or methods that are not also decorated with
    :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>`.  You can still apply these decorators
    in any order, though you should only do so once each.
  * Applying :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>` twice was already deprecated, and
    applying :func:`@settings(...) <hypothesis.settings>` twice is deprecated in
    this release and will become an error in a future version. Neither could ever
    be used twice to good effect.
  * Using :func:`@settings(...) <hypothesis.settings>` as the sole decorator on
    atest is completely pointless, so this common usage error will become an
    error in a future version of Hypothesis.
- Update to 3.51.0
  * This release deprecates the ``average_size`` argument to
    :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.lists` and other collection strategies.
    You should simply delete it wherever it was used in your tests, as it
    no longer has any effect.
    In early versions of Hypothesis, the ``average_size`` argument was treated
    as a hint about the distribution of examples from a strategy.  Subsequent
    improvements to the conceptual model and the engine for generating and
    shrinking examples mean it is more effective to simply describe what
    constitutes a valid example, and let our internals handle the distribution.
- Update to 3.50.3
  * This patch contains some internal refactoring so that we can run
    with warnings as errors in CI.
- Update to 3.50.2
  * This has no user-visible changes except one slight formatting change to one docstring, to avoid a deprecation warning.
- Update to 3.50.1
  * This patch fixes an internal error introduced in :ref:`3.48.0 <v3.48.0>`, where a check
    for the Django test runner would expose import-time errors in Django
    configuration (:issue:`1167`).
- Update to 3.50.0
  * This release improves validation of numeric bounds for some strategies.
    + :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.integers` and :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.floats`
      now raise ``InvalidArgument`` if passed a ``min_value`` or ``max_value``
      which is not an instance of :class:`~python:numbers.Real`, instead of
      various internal errors.
    + :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.floats` now converts its bounding values to
      the nearest float above or below the min or max bound respectively, instead
      of just casting to float.  The old behaviour was incorrect in that you could
      generate ``float(min_value)``, even when this was less than ``min_value``
      itself (possible with eg. fractions).
    + When both bounds are provided to :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.floats` but
      there are no floats in the interval, such as ``[(2**54)+1 .. (2**55)-1]``,
      InvalidArgument is raised.
    + :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.decimals` gives a more useful error message
      if passed a string that cannot be converted to :class:`~python:decimal.Decimal`
      in a context where this error is not trapped.
     Code that previously **seemed** to work may be explicitly broken if there
     were no floats between ``min_value`` and ``max_value`` (only possible with
     non-float bounds), or if a bound was not a :class:`~python:numbers.Real`
     number but still allowed in :obj:`python:math.isnan` (some custom classes
     with a ``__float__`` method).
- Update to 3.49.1
  * This patch fixes our tests for Numpy dtype strategies on big-endian platforms,
    where the strategy behaved correctly but the test assumed that the native byte
    order was little-endian.
    There is no user impact unless you are running our test suite on big-endian
    platforms.  Thanks to Graham Inggs for reporting :issue:`1164`.
- Update to 3.49.0
  * This release deprecates passing ``elements=None`` to collection strategies,
    such as :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.lists`.
    Requiring ``lists(nothing())`` or ``builds(list)`` instead of ``lists()``
    means slightly more typing, but also improves the consistency and
    discoverability of our API - as well as showing how to compose or
    construct strategies in ways that still work in more complex situations.
    Passing a nonzero max_size to a collection strategy where the elements
    strategy contains no values is now deprecated, and will be an error in a
    future version.  The equivalent with ``elements=None`` is already an error.
- Update to 3.48.1
  * This patch will minimize examples that would come out non-minimal in previous versions. Thanks to Kyle Reeve for this patch.
- Update to 3.48.0
  * This release improves some "unhappy paths" when using Hypothesis
    with the standard library :mod:`python:unittest` module:
    + Applying :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>` to a non-test method which is
      overridden from :class:`python:unittest.TestCase`, such as ``setUp``,
      raises :attr:`a new health check <hypothesis.settings.not_a_test_method>`.
      (:issue:`991`)
    + Using :meth:`~python:unittest.TestCase.subTest` within a test decorated
      with :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>` would leak intermediate results
      when tests were run under the :mod:`python:unittest` test runner.
      Individual reporting of failing subtests is now disabled during a test
      using :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>`.  (:issue:`1071`)
    + :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>` is still not a class decorator, but the
      error message if you try using it on a class has been improved.
     As a related improvement, using :class:`django:django.test.TestCase` with
     :func:`@given <hypothesis.given>` instead of
     :class:`hypothesis.extra.django.TestCase` raises an explicit error instead
     of running all examples in a single database transaction.
- Update to 3.47.0
  * :obj:`~hypothesis.settings.register_profile` now accepts keyword arguments
    for specific settings, and the parent settings object is now optional.
    Using a ``name`` for a registered profile which is not a string was never
    suggested, but it is now also deprecated and will eventually be an error.
- Update to 3.46.2
  * This release removes an unnecessary branch from the code, and has no user-visible impact.
- Update to 3.46.1
  * This changes only the formatting of our docstrings and should have no user-visible effects.
- Update to 3.46.0
  * :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.characters` has improved docs about
    what arguments are valid, and additional validation logic to raise a
    clear error early (instead of e.g. silently ignoring a bad argument).
    Categories may be specified as the Unicode 'general category'
    (eg ``u'Nd'``), or as the 'major category' (eg ``[u'N', u'Lu']``
    is equivalent to ``[u'Nd', u'Nl', u'No', u'Lu']``).
  * In previous versions, general categories were supported and all other
    input was silently ignored.  Now, major categories are supported in
    addition to general categories (which may change the behaviour of some
    existing code), and all other input is deprecated.
- Update to 3.45.5
  * This patch improves strategy inference in :mod:`hypothesis.extra.django`
    to account for some validators in addition to field type - see
    :issue:`1116` for ongoing work in this space.
    Specifically, if a :class:`~django:django.db.models.CharField` or
    :class:`~django:django.db.models.TextField` has an attached
    :class:`~django:django.core.validators.RegexValidator`, we now use
    :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.from_regex` instead of
    :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.text` as the underlying strategy.
    This allows us to generate examples of the default
    :class:`~django:django.contrib.auth.models.User` model, closing :issue:`1112`.
- Update to 3.45.4
  * This patch improves some internal debugging information, fixes
    atypo in a validation error message, and expands the documentation
    for new contributors.

- update to version 3.44.16:
  * This release improves test case reduction for recursive data
    structures. Hypothesis now guarantees that whenever a strategy
    calls itself recursively (usually this will happen because you are
    using deferred()), any recursive call may replace the top level
    value. e.g. given a tree structure, Hypothesis will always try
    replacing it with a subtree.
  * Additionally this introduces a new heuristic that may in some
    circumstances significantly speed up test case reduction -
    Hypothesis should be better at immediately replacing elements
    drawn inside another strategy with their minimal possible value.

- changes from version 3.44.15:
  * from_type() can now resolve recursive types such as binary trees
    (issue #1004). Detection of non-type arguments has also improved,
    leading to better error messages in many cases involving forward
    references.

- changes from version 3.44.14 :
  * This release fixes a bug in the shrinker that prevented the
    optimisations in 3.44.6 from working in some cases. It would not
    have worked correctly when filtered examples were nested
    (e.g. with a set of integers in some range).
  * This would not have resulted in any correctness problems, but
    shrinking may have been slower than it otherwise could be.

- changes from version 3.44.13:
  * This release changes the average bit length of values drawn from
    integers() to be much smaller. Additionally it changes the
    shrinking order so that now size is considered before sign -
    e.g. -1 will be preferred to +10.
  * The new internal format for integers required some changes to the
    minimizer to make work well, so you may also see some improvements
    to example quality in unrelated areas.

- changes from version 3.44.12:
  * This changes Hypothesis’s internal implementation of weighted
    sampling. This will affect example distribution and quality, but
    you shouldn’t see any other effects.

- changes from version 3.44.11 :
  * This is a change to some internals around how Hypothesis handles
    avoiding generating duplicate examples and seeking out novel
    regions of the search space.
  * You are unlikely to see much difference as a result of it, but it
    fixes a bug where an internal assertion could theoretically be
    triggered and has some minor effects on the distribution of
    examples so could potentially find bugs that have previously been
    missed.

- changes from version 3.44.10:
  * This patch avoids creating debug statements when debugging is
    disabled. Profiling suggests this is a 5-10% performance
    improvement (issue #1040).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  6 17:11:29 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.9:
  * This patch blacklists null characters ('\x00') in automatically
    created strategies for Django CharField and TextField, due to a
    database issue which was recently fixed upstream (Hypothesis issue
    #1045).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  6 07:24:23 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.8:
  * This release makes the Hypothesis shrinker slightly less greedy in
    order to avoid local minima - when it gets stuck, it makes a small
    attempt to search around the final example it would previously
    have returned to find a new starting point to shrink from. This
    should improve example quality in some cases, especially ones
    where the test data has dependencies among parts of it that make
    it difficult for Hypothesis to proceed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  4 17:06:43 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.7:
  * This release adds support for Django 2 in the hypothesis-django
    extra.
  * This release drops support for Django 1.10, as it is no longer
    supported by the Django team.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  3 22:43:51 UTC 2018 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.6:
  * This release speeds up test case reduction in many examples by
    being better at detecting large shrinks it can use to discard
    redundant parts of its input. This will be particularly noticeable
    in examples that make use of filtering and for some integer
    ranges.

- changes from version 3.44.5:
  * This is a no-op release that updates the year range on all of the
    copyright headers in our source to include 2018.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 31 05:55:59 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.4:
  * This release fixes issue #1044, which slowed tests by up to 6% due
    to broken caching.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 18:22:00 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.44.3:
  * This release improves the shrinker in cases where examples drawn
    earlier can affect how much data is drawn later (e.g. when you
    draw a length parameter in a composite and then draw that many
    elements). Examples found in cases like this should now be much
    closer to minimal.

- changes from version 3.44.2:
  * This is a pure refactoring release which changes how Hypothesis
    manages its set of examples internally. It should have no
    externally visible effects.

- changes from version 3.44.1:
  * This release fixes issue #997, in which under some circumstances
    the body of tests run under Hypothesis would not show up when run
    under coverage even though the tests were run and the code they
    called outside of the test file would show up normally.

- changes from version 3.44.0:
  * This release adds a new feature: The @reproduce_failure, designed
    to make it easy to use Hypothesis’s binary format for examples to
    reproduce a problem locally without having to share your example
    database between machines.
    This also changes when seeds are printed:
    + They will no longer be printed for normal falsifying examples,
      as there are now adequate ways of reproducing those for all
      cases, so it just contributes noise.
    + They will once again be printed when reusing examples from the
      database, as health check failures should now be more reliable
      in this scenario so it will almost always work in this case.

- changes from version 3.43.1:
  * This release fixes a bug with Hypothesis’s database management -
    examples that were found in the course of shrinking were saved in
    a way that indicated that they had distinct causes, and so they
    would all be retried on the start of the next test. The intended
    behaviour, which is now what is implemented, is that only a
    bounded subset of these examples would be retried.

Sun Dec 17 01:26:12 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.43.0:
  * HypothesisDeprecationWarning now inherits from FutureWarning
    instead of DeprecationWarning, as recommended by PEP 565 for
    user-facing warnings (issue #618). If you have not changed the
    default warnings settings, you will now see each distinct
    HypothesisDeprecationWarning instead of only the first.

Fri Dec 15 08:55:52 UTC 2017 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Add patch python-hypothesis-build.patch 
  to fix Factory build error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 15:00:24 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Update to 3.42.2:
  * Few tiny fixes
- Switch to github tarball to contain tests
- Make sure to state all buildtime dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 12 00:54:26 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.42.1:
  * This release has some internal cleanup, which makes reading the
    code more pleasant and may shrink large examples slightly faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  9 17:39:47 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * removed conditional for test as requested in SR 555280
  * added coverage as a requirement

- update to version 3.42.0:
  * This release deprecates hypothesis[fakefactory], which was
    designed as a transition strategy but does not support example
    shrinking or coverage-guided discovery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  7 16:46:53 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.41.0:
  * sampled_from() can now sample from one-dimensional numpy
    ndarrays. Sampling from multi-dimensional ndarrays still results
    in a deprecation warning. Thanks to Charlie Tanksley for this
    patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  6 02:52:35 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.40.1:

3.40.1 - 2017-12-04
  * This release makes two changes:
    + It makes the calculation of some of the metadata that Hypothesis
      uses for shrinking occur lazily. This should speed up
      performance of test case generation a bit because it no longer
      calculates information it doesn’t need.
    + It improves the shrinker for certain classes of nested
      examples. e.g. when shrinking lists of lists, the shrinker is
      now able to concatenate two adjacent lists together into a
      single list. As a result of this change, shrinking may get
      somewhat slower when the minimal example found is large.

- changes from version 3.40.0:
  * This release improves how various ways of seeding Hypothesis
    interact with the example database:
    + Using the example database with seed() is now deprecated. You
      should set database=None if you are doing that. This will only
      warn if you actually load examples from the database while using
      @seed.
    + The derandomize will behave the same way as @seed.
    + Using --hypothesis-seed will disable use of the database.
    + If a test used examples from the database, it will not suggest
      using a seed to reproduce it, because that won’t work.

- changes from version 3.39.0:
  * This release adds a new health check that checks if the smallest
    “natural” possible example of your test case is very large - this
    will tend to cause Hypothesis to generate bad examples and be
    quite slow.

- changes from version 3.38.9:
  * This is a documentation release to improve the documentation of
    shrinking behaviour for Hypothesis’s strategies.

- changes from version 3.38.8:
  * This release improves the performance of characters() when using
    blacklist_characters and from_regex() when using negative
    character classes.

- changes from version 3.38.7:
  * This is a patch release for from_regex(), which had a bug in
    handling of the re.VERBOSE flag (issue #992). Flags are now
    handled correctly when parsing regex.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 28 19:04:24 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.38.6:
  * This patch changes a few byte-string literals from double to
    single quotes, thanks to an update in unify. There are no
    user-visible changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 26 21:26:33 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.38.5:
  * This fixes the repr of strategies using lambda that are defined
    inside decorators to include the lambda source.
    This would mostly have been visible when using the statistics
    functionality - lambdas used for e.g. filtering would have shown
    up with a <unknown> as their body. This can still happen, but it
    should happen less often now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 22 19:42:32 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.38.4:
  * This release updates the reported statistics so that they show
    approximately what fraction of your test run time is spent in data
    generation (as opposed to test execution).

- changes from version 3.38.3:
  * This is a documentation release, which ensures code examples are
    up to date by running them as doctests in CI (issue #711).

- changes from version 3.38.2:
  * This release changes the behaviour of the deadline setting when
    used with data(): Time spent inside calls to data.draw will no
    longer be counted towards the deadline time.
  * As a side effect of some refactoring required for this work, the
    way flaky tests are handled has changed slightly. You are unlikely
    to see much difference from this, but some error messages will
    have changed.

- changes from version 3.38.1:
  * This patch has a variety of non-user-visible refactorings,
    removing various minor warts ranging from indirect imports to
    typos in comments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 19 05:19:56 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.38.0:
  * This release overhauls the health check system in a variety of
    small ways. It adds no new features, but is nevertheless a minor
    release because it changes which tests are likely to fail health
    checks.
  * The most noticeable effect is that some tests that used to fail
    health checks will now pass, and some that used to pass will
    fail. These should all be improvements in accuracy. In particular:
    + New failures will usually be because they are now taking into
      account things like use of data() and assume() inside the test
      body.
    + New failures may also be because for some classes of example the
      way data generation performance was measured was artificially
      faster than real data generation (for most examples that are
      hitting performance health checks the opposite should be the
      case).
    + Tests that used to fail health checks and now pass do so because
      the health check system used to run in a way that was subtly
      different than the main Hypothesis data generation and lacked
      some of its support for e.g. large examples.
  * If your data generation is especially slow, you may also see your
    tests get somewhat faster, as there is no longer a separate health
    check phase. This will be particularly noticeable when rerunning
    test failures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 01:32:07 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.37.0:
  * This is a deprecation release for some health check related
    features.
  * The following are now deprecated:
    + Passing exception_in_generation to suppress_health_check. This
      no longer does anything even when passed - All errors that occur
      during data generation will now be immediately reraised rather
      than going through the health check mechanism.
    + Passing random_module to suppress_health_check. This hasn’t done
      anything for a long time, but was never explicitly
      deprecated. Hypothesis always seeds the random module when
      running @given tests, so this is no longer an error and
      suppressing it doesn’t do anything.
    + Passing non-HealthCheck values in suppress_health_check. This
      was previously allowed but never did anything useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 11 17:16:21 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.36.1:
  * This is a yak shaving release, mostly concerned with our own
    tests.
    While getfullargspec() was documented as deprecated in Python 3.5,
    it never actually emitted a warning. Our code to silence this
    (nonexistent) warning has therefore been removed.
    We now run our tests with DeprecationWarning as an error, and made
    some minor changes to our own tests as a result. This required
    similar upstream updates to coverage and execnet (a test-time
    dependency via pytest-xdist).
    There is no user-visible change in Hypothesis itself, but we
    encourage you to consider enabling deprecations as errors in your
    own tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 23:22:24 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.36.0:
  * This release adds a setting to the public API, and does some
    internal cleanup:
    + The derandomize setting is now documented (issue #890)
    + Removed - and disallowed - all ‘bare excepts’ in Hypothesis
      (issue #953)
    + Documented the strict setting as deprecated, and updated the
      build so our docs always match deprecations in the code.

- changes from version 3.35.0:
  * This minor release supports constraining uuids() to generate
    uuid.UUID`s of a particular version. (:issue:`721)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  4 02:01:40 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.34.1:
  * This patch updates the documentation to suggest builds(callable)
    instead of just(callable()).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  3 05:13:56 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.34.0:
  * Hypothesis now emits deprecation warnings if you apply @given more
    than once to a target.
    Applying @given repeatedly wraps the target multiple times. Each
    wrapper will search the space of of possible parameters
    separately. This is equivalent but will be much more inefficient
    than doing it with a single call to @given.
    For example, instead of @given(booleans()) @given(integers()), you
    could write @given(booleans(), integers())

- changes from version 3.33.1 :
  * builds() would try to infer a strategy for required positional
    arguments of the target from type hints, even if they had been
    given to builds() as positional arguments (issue #946). Now it
    only infers missing required arguments.
  * An internal introspection function wrongly reported self as a
    required argument for bound methods, which might also have
    affected builds(). Now it knows better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 17 01:47:00 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.33.0:
  * This release supports strategy inference for more field types in
    Django models() - you can now omit an argument for Date, Time,
    Duration, Slug, IP Address, and UUID fields. (issue #642)
  * Strategy generation for fields with grouped choices now selects
    choices from each group, instead of selecting from the group
    names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 15 22:19:10 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- specfile:
  * removed sed for src/hypothesis/tools/mergedbs.py, not in tar-ball anymore

- update to version 3.32.2:
  * This patch removes the mergedb tool, introduced in Hypothesis
    1.7.1 on an experimental basis. It has never actually worked, and
    the new Hypothesis example database is designed to make such a
    tool unnecessary.

- changes from version 3.32.1:
  * This patch has two improvements for strategies based on
    enumerations.
  * from_type() now handles enumerations correctly, delegating to
    sampled_from(). Previously it noted that Enum.__init__ has no
    required arguments and therefore delegated to builds(), which
    would subsequently fail.
  * When sampling from an enum.Flag, we also generate combinations of
    members. Eg for Flag('Permissions', 'READ, WRITE, EXECUTE') we can
    now generate, Permissions.READ, Permissions.READ|WRITE, and so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 04:06:23 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.32.0:
  * This changes the default value of use_coverage=True to True when
    running on pypy (it was already True on CPython).

    It was previously set to False because we expected it to be too
    slow, but recent benchmarking shows that actually performance of
    the feature on pypy is fairly acceptable - sometimes it’s slower
    than on CPython, sometimes it’s faster, but it’s generally within
    a factor of two either way.

- changes from version 3.31.6:
  * This patch improves the quality of strategies inferred from Numpy
    dtypes:
    + Integer dtypes generated examples with the upper half of their
      (non-sign) bits set to zero. The inferred strategies can now
      produce any representable integer.
    + Fixed-width unicode- and byte-string dtypes now cap the internal
      example length, which should improve example and shrink quality.
    + Numpy arrays can only store fixed-size strings internally, and
      allow shorter strings by right-padding them with null
      bytes. Inferred string strategies no longer generate such
      values, as they can never be retrieved from an array. This
      improves shrinking performance by skipping useless values.
    + This has already been useful in Hypothesis - we found an
      overflow bug in our Pandas support, and as a result indexes()
      and range_indexes() now check that min_size and max_size are at
      least zero.

- changes from version 3.31.5:
  * This release fixes a performance problem in tests where
    + use_coverage is set to True.
    + Tests experience a slow-down proportionate to the amount of code
      they cover. This is still the case, but the factor is now low
      enough that it should be unnoticeable. Previously it was large
      and became much larger in 3.28.4.

- changes from version 3.31.4:
  * from_type() failed with a very confusing error if passed a
    NewType() (issue #901). These psudeo-types are now unwrapped
    correctly, and strategy inference works as expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  6 19:43:51 UTC 2017 - arun@gmx.de

- update to version 3.31.3:
  * This release makes some small optimisations to our use of coverage
    that should reduce constant per-example overhead. This is probably
    only noticeable on examples where the test itself is quite
    fast. On no-op tests that don’t test anything you may see up to a
    fourfold speed increase (which is still significantly slower than
    without coverage). On more realistic tests the speed up is likely
    to be less than that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 12:11:08 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add python-attrs and python-coverage requires, matching the info

Mon May  9 17:57:36 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 3.1.3
  + Single bug fix release
    * Another charmap problem. In 3.1.2 text/characters would break on systems
      which had /tmp/ mounted on a different partition than the Hypothesis
      storage directory (usually in home). This fixes that.
- Update to 3.1.2
  + Single bug fix release:
    * Anything which used a text() or characters() strategy was broken on 
      Windows and I hadn’t updated appveyor to use the new repository location
      so I  didn’t notice. This is now fixed and windows support should work
      correctly.
- Update to 3.1.1
  + Minor bug fix release.
    * Fix concurrency issue when running tests that use text() from multiple 
      processes at once (Bug #302, thanks to Alex Chan).
    * Improve performance of code using lists with max_size (thanks to Cristi 
      Cobzarenco).
    * Fix install on Python 2 with ancient versions of pip so that it installs 
      the enum34 backport (thanks to Donald Stufft for telling me how to do
      this).
    * Remove duplicated __all__ exports from hypothesis.strategies (thanks to 
      Piët Delport).
    * Update headers to point to new repository location.
    * Allow use of strategies that can’t be used in find() (e.g. choices) in 
      stateful testing.
- Update to 3.1.0
  * Add a ‘nothing’ strategy that never successfully generates values.
  * sampled_from() and one_of() can both now be called with an empty argument 
    list, in which case they also never generate any values.
  * one_of may now be called with a single argument that is a collection of 
    strategies as well as as varargs.
  * Add a ‘runner’ strategy which returns the instance of the current test 
    object if there is one.
  * ‘Bundle’ for RuleBasedStateMachine is now a normal(ish) strategy and can be 
    used as such.
  * Tests using RuleBasedStateMachine should now shrink significantly better.
  * Hypothesis now uses a pretty-printing library internally, compatible with 
    IPython’s pretty printing protocol (actually using the same code). This may
    improve the quality of output in some cases.
  * As a ‘phases’ setting that allows more fine grained control over which 
    parts of the process Hypothesis runs
  * Add a suppress_health_check setting which allows you to turn off specific 
    health checks in a fine grained manner.
  * Fix a bug where lists of non fixed size would always draw one more element 
    than they included. This mostly didn’t matter, but if would cause problems with 
    empty strategies or ones with side effects.
  * Add a mechanism to the Django model generator to allow you to explicitly 
    request the default value (thanks to Jeremy Thurgood for this one).
- Update to 3.0.5
  * Fix a bug where Hypothesis would now error on py.test development versions.
- Update to 3.0.4
  * Fix a bug where Hypothesis would error when running on Python 2.7.3 or 
    earlier because it was trying to pass a bytearray object to struct.unpack 
    (which is only supported since 2.7.4).
- Update to 3.0.3
  * Fix version parsing of py.test to work with py.test release candidates
  * More general handling of the health check problem where things could fail 
    because of a cache miss - now one “free” example is generated before the
    start  of the health check run.
- Update to 3.0.2
  * Under certain circumstances, strategies involving text() buried inside some 
    other strategy (e.g. text().filter(...) or recursive(text(), ...)) would
    cause  a test to fail its health checks the first time it ran. This was
    caused by  having to compute some related data and cache it to disk. On
    travis or anywhere else where the .hypothesis directory was recreated this
    would have caused the tests to fail their health check on every run. This
    is now fixed for all the known cases, although there could be others
    lurking.
- Update to 3.0.1
  * Fix a case where it was possible to trigger an “Unreachable” assertion when 
    running certain flaky stateful tests.
  * Improve shrinking of large stateful tests by eliminating a case where it 
    was hard to delete early steps.
  * Improve efficiency of drawing binary(min_size=n, max_size=n) significantly 
    by provide a custom implementation for fixed size blocks that can bypass a
    lot of machinery.
  * Set default home directory based on the current working directory at the 
    point Hypothesis is imported, not whenever the function first happens to be
    called.
- Update to 3.0.0
  + Externally this looks like a very small release. It has one small breaking 
    change that probably doesn’t affect anyone at all (some behaviour that
    never really worked correctly is now outright forbidden) but necessitated a
    major version bump and one visible new feature.
    Internally this is a complete rewrite. Almost nothing other than the 
    public API is the same.
  + New features:
    * Addition of data() strategy which allows you to draw arbitrary data 
      interactively within the test.
    * New “exploded” database format which allows you to more easily check the 
      example database into a source repository while supporting merging.
    * Better management of how examples are saved in the database.
    * Health checks will now raise as errors when they fail. It was too easy to 
      have the warnings be swallowed entirely.
  + New limitations:
    * choices and streaming strategies may no longer be used with find(). 
      Neither may data() (this is the change that necessitated a major version
      bump).
  + Feature removal:
    * The ForkingTestCase executor has gone away. It may return in some more 
      working form at a later date.
  + Performance improvements:
    * A new model which allows flatmap, composite strategies and stateful 
      testing to perform much better. They should also be more reliable.
    * Filtering may in some circumstances have improved significantly. This 
      will help especially in cases where you have lots of values with
      individual filters on them, such as lists(x.filter(...)).
    * Modest performance improvements to the general test runner by avoiding 
      expensive operations
    * In general your tests should have got faster. If they’ve instead got 
      significantly slower, I’m interested in hearing about it.
  + Data distribution:
    * The data distribution should have changed significantly. This may uncover 
      bugs the previous version missed. It may also miss bugs the previous
      version could have uncovered. Hypothesis is now producing less strongly
      correlated data than it used to, but the correlations are extended over
      more of the structure.
  + Shrinking:
    * Shrinking quality should have improved. In particular Hypothesis can now 
      perform simultaneous shrinking of separate examples within a single test 
      (previously it was only able to do this for elements of a single
      collection). 
      In some cases performance will have improved, in some cases it will have
      got worse but generally shouldn’t have by much.
- Update to 2.0.0
  + This release cleans up all of the legacy that accrued in the course of 
    Hypothesis 1.0. These are mostly things that were emitting deprecation
    warnings in 1.19.0, but there were a few additional changes.
    In particular:
    * non-strategy values will no longer be converted to strategies when used 
      in given or find.
    * FailedHealthCheck is now an error and not a warning.
    * Handling of non-ascii reprs in user types have been simplified by using 
      raw strings in more places in Python 2.
    * given no longer allows mixing positional and keyword arguments.
    * given no longer works with functions with defaults.
    * given no longer turns provided arguments into defaults - they will not 
      appear in the argspec at all.
    * the basic() strategy no longer exists.
    * the n_ary_tree strategy no longer exists.
    * the average_list_length setting no longer exists. Note: If you’re using 
      using recursive() this will cause you a significant slow down. You should
      pass explicit average_size parameters to collections in recursive calls.
    * @rule can no longer be applied to the same method twice.
    * Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer officially supported, although in 
      practice they still work fine.
  + This also includes two non-deprecation changes:
    * given’s keyword arguments no longer have to be the rightmost arguments 
      and can appear anywhere in the method signature.
    * The max_shrinks setting would sometimes not have been respected.
- Update to 1.19.0
  + This release heralds the beginning of a new and terrible age of Hypothesis 
      2.0.
    It’s primary purpose is some final deprecations prior to said release. The 
      goal is that if your code emits no warnings under this release then it
      will probably run unchanged under Hypothesis 2.0 (there are some caveats
      to this: 2.0 will drop support for some Python versions, and if you’re
      using internal APIs then as usual that may break without warning).
  + It does have two new features:
    * New @seed() decorator which allows you to manually seed a test. This may 
      be harmlessly combined with and overrides the derandomize setting.
    * settings objects may now be used as a decorator to fix those settings to 
      a particular @given test.
  + API changes (old usage still works but is deprecated):
    * Settings has been renamed to settings (lower casing) in order to make the 
      decorator usage more natural.
    * Functions for the storage directory that were in hypothesis.settings are 
      now in a new hypothesis.configuration module.
  + Additional deprecations:
    * the average_list_length setting has been deprecated in favour of being 
      explicit.
    * the basic() strategy has been deprecated as it is impossible to support 
      it under a Conjecture based model, which will hopefully be implemented at
      some point in the 2.x series.
    * the n_ary_tree strategy (which was never actually part of the public API) 
      has been deprecated.
    * Passing settings or random as keyword arguments to given is deprecated 
      (use the new functionality instead)
  + Bug fixes:
    * No longer emit PendingDeprecationWarning for __iter__ and StopIteration 
      in streaming() values.
    * When running in health check mode with non strict, don’t print quite so 
      many errors for an exception in reify.
    * When an assumption made in a test or a filter is flaky, tests will now 
      raise Flaky instead of UnsatisfiedAssumption.
- Update to 1.18.1
  + Two behind the scenes changes:
    * Hypothesis will no longer write generated code to the file system. This 
      will improve performance on some systems (e.g. if you’re using
      PythonAnywhere which is running your code from NFS) and prevent some
      annoying interactions with auto-restarting systems.
    * Hypothesis will cache the creation of some strategies. This can 
      significantly improve performance for code that uses flatmap or composite
      and thus has to instantiate strategies a lot.
- Update to 1.18.0
  + Features:
    * Tests and find are now explicitly seeded off the global random module. 
      This means that if you nest one inside the other you will now get a
      health check error. It also means that you can control global
      randomization by seeding random.
    * There is a new random_module() strategy which seeds the global random 
      module for you and handles things so that you don’t get a health check
      warning if you use it inside your tests.
    * floats() now accepts two new arguments: allow_nan and allow_infinity. 
      These default to the old behaviour, but when set to False will do what
      the names suggest.
  + Bug fixes:
    * Fix a bug where tests that used text() on Python 3.4+ would not actually 
      be deterministic even when explicitly seeded or using the derandomize
      mode, because generation depended on dictionary iteration order which was
      affected by hash randomization.
    * Fix a bug where with complicated strategies the timing of the initial 
      health check could affect the seeding of the subsequent test, which would
      also render supposedly deterministic tests non-deterministic in some
      scenarios.
    * In some circumstances flatmap() could get confused by two structurally 
      similar things it could generate and would produce a flaky test where the
      first time it produced an error but the second time it produced the other
      value, which was not an error. The same bug was presumably also possible
      in composite().
    * flatmap() and composite() initial generation should now be moderately 
      faster. This will be particularly noticeable when you have many values
      drawn from the same strategy in a single run, e.g. constructs like 
      lists(s.flatmap(f)). Shrinking performance may have suffered, but this
      didn’t actually produce an interestingly worse result in any of the
      standard scenarios tested.
- Update to 1.17.1
  * A small bug fix release, which fixes the fact that the ‘note’ function 
      could not be used on tests which used the @example decorator to provide 
      explicit examples.
- Update to 1.17.0
  + This is actually the same release as 1.16.1, but 1.16.1 has been pulled 
    because it contains the following additional change that was not intended
    to be in a patch release (it’s perfectly stable, but is a larger change
    that should  have required a minor version bump):
    * Hypothesis will now perform a series of “health checks” as part of 
      running your tests. These detect and warn about some common error
      conditions that people often run into which wouldn’t necessarily have
      caued the test to  fail but would cause e.g. degraded performance or
      confusing results.
- Update to 1.16.1
  * A small bugfix release that allows bdists for Hypothesis to be built under 
      2.7 - the compat3.py file which had Python 3 syntax wasn’t intended to be 
      loaded under Python 2, but when building a bdist it was. In particular
      this would break running setup.py test.

- update to 1.16.0:
  * Functions from hypothesis.strategies will no longer raise InvalidArgument on bad arguments
  * Errors caused by accidentally invoking the legacy API are now much less confusing
  * hypothesis.extra.django is 1.9 compatible.
  * When tests are run with max_shrinks=0 this will now still rerun the test on failure
