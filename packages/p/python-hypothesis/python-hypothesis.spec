%description
Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much larger range
of examples than you would ever want to write by hand. It's based on the Haskell
library, Quickcheck, and is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing
Python unit testing work flow.

Hypothesis works with most widely used versions of Python. It supports implementations
compatible with 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+, and is known to work on CPython and PyPy (but not
PyPy3 until they support a 3.3 compatible version of the language). It does *not* currently
work on Jython or on Python 3.0 through 3.2.
