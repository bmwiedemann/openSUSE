pyenv Manual Page Version 1.1.3
===============================

Synopsis
--------

.. _invocation:

.. sourcecode:: bash

     $ pyenv <command> [<args>]


Description
-----------

pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project was forked from `rbenv`_ and `ruby-build`_, and modified
for Python.


Command Reference
-----------------

See the file :file:`COMMANDS.md` in the documentation directory. For
SUSE related systems, refer to ``/usr/share/doc/packages/pyenv/COMMANDS.md``.


Development
-----------

The pyenv source code is hosted on GitHub, see `pyenv`_.
It's clean, modular, and easy to understand, even if you're not a shell hacker.
