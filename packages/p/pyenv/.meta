  <title>Simple Python version management</title>
  <description>pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python.
It is simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose
tools that do one thing well.

This project was forked from rbenv and ruby-build, and modified for Python.
