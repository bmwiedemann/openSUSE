Sat Jun  8 13:12:02 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.12.2:
  * Fix regression in v4.12.0 where specialization of certain
  * generics with an overridden `__eq__` method would raise
    errors.
  * Fix tests so they pass on 3.13.0b2
  * Preliminary changes for compatibility with the draft
    implementation of PEP 649 in Python 3.14.
  * Fix regression in v4.12.0 where nested `Annotated` types
    would cause `TypeError` to be raised if the nested
    `Annotated` type had unhashable metadata.
  * Fix incorrect behaviour of `typing_extensions.ParamSpec` on
    Python 3.8 and 3.9 that meant that
    `isinstance(typing_extensions.ParamSpec("P"),
    typing.TypeVar)` would have a different result in some
    situations depending on whether or not a profiling
    function had been set using `sys.setprofile`.
  * This release focuses on compatibility with the upcoming
    release of Python 3.13. Most changes are related to the
    implementation of type parameter defaults (PEP 696).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 17:27:56 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.11.0:
  * Fix tests on Python 3.13.0a5. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
  * Fix the runtime behavior of type parameters with defaults
  * Fix minor discrepancy between error messages produced by
    `typing` and `typing_extensions` on Python 3.10.
  * When `include_extra=False`, `get_type_hints()` now strips
    `ReadOnly` from the annotation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 07:10:15 UTC 2024 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to 4.10.0:
  This feature release adds support for PEP 728 (TypedDict with extra
  items) and PEP 742 (``TypeIs``).
  - Add support for PEP 728, supporting the `closed` keyword argument and the
    special `__extra_items__` key for TypedDict. Patch by Zixuan James Li.
  - Add support for PEP 742, adding `typing_extensions.TypeIs`. Patch
    by Jelle Zijlstra.
  - Drop runtime error when a read-only `TypedDict` item overrides a mutable
    one. Type checkers should still flag this as an error. Patch by Jelle
    Zijlstra.
  - Speedup `issubclass()` checks against simple runtime-checkable protocols by
    around 6% (backporting https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112717, by Alex
    Waygood).
  - Fix a regression in the implementation of protocols where `typing.Protocol`
    classes that were not marked as `@runtime_checkable` would be unnecessarily
    introspected, potentially causing exceptions to be raised if the protocol had
    problematic members. Patch by Alex Waygood, backporting
    https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/113401.
- obsoletes backport-recent-implementation-of-protocol.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 18:18:41 UTC 2024 - Daniel Garcia <daniel.garcia@suse.com>

- Add backport-recent-implementation-of-protocol.patch upstream patch
  gh#python/typing_extensions@004b893ddce2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 27 11:35:58 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.9.0:
  * This feature release adds `typing_extensions.ReadOnly`, as
    specified by PEP 705, and makes various other improvements,
    especially to `@typing_extensions.deprecated()`.
  * Add support for PEP 705, adding `typing_extensions.ReadOnly`.
  * All parameters on `NewType.__call__` are now positional-only.
    This means that the signature of
    `typing_extensions.NewType.__call__` now exactly matches the
  * signature of `typing.NewType.__call__`.
  * Fix bug with using `@deprecated` on a mixin class.
  * Exclude `__match_args__` from `Protocol` members.
  * When creating a `typing_extensions.NamedTuple` class, ensure
    `__set_name__` is called on all objects that define
    `__set_name__` and exist in the values of the `NamedTuple`
    class's class dictionary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 19 10:26:29 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@cepl.eu>

- Update to 4.8.0:
  - Add typing_extensions.Doc, as proposed by PEP 727
  - Drop support for Python 3.7 (including PyPy-3.7)
  - Fix bug where get_original_bases() would return incorrect
    results when called on a concrete subclass of a generic class
  - Fix bug where ParamSpec(default=...) would raise a TypeError
    on Python versions <3.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 13 12:53:12 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 4.7.1:
 - Fix support for `TypedDict`, `NamedTuple` and `is_protocol` on PyPy-3.7 and
   PyPy-3.8. Patch by Alex Waygood. Note that PyPy-3.7 and PyPy-3.8 are unsupported
   by the PyPy project. The next feature release of typing-extensions will
   drop support for PyPy-3.7 and may also drop support for PyPy-3.8.
- update to version 4.7.0:
 - This is expected to be the last feature release supporting Python 3.7,
   which reaches its end of life on June 27, 2023. Version 4.8.0 will support
   only Python 3.8.0 and up.
 - Fix bug where a `typing_extensions.Protocol` class that had one or more
   non-callable members would raise `TypeError` when `issubclass()`
   was called against it, even if it defined a custom `__subclasshook__`
   method. The correct behaviour -- which has now been restored -- is not to
   raise `TypeError` in these situations if a custom `__subclasshook__` method
   is defined. Patch by Alex Waygood (backporting
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105976).
- update to version 4.7.0rc1:
 - Add `typing_extensions.get_protocol_members` and
   `typing_extensions.is_protocol` (backport of CPython PR #104878).
   Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - `typing_extensions` now re-exports all names in the standard library's
   `typing` module, except the deprecated `ByteString`. Patch by Jelle
   Zijlstra.
 - Due to changes in the implementation of `typing_extensions.Protocol`,
   `typing.runtime_checkable` can now be used on `typing_extensions.Protocol`
   (previously, users had to use `typing_extensions.runtime_checkable` if they
   were using `typing_extensions.Protocol`).
 - Align the implementation of `TypedDict` with the implementation in the
   standard library on Python 3.9 and higher.
   `typing_extensions.TypedDict` is now a function instead of a class. The
   private functions `_check_fails`, `_dict_new`, and `_typeddict_new`
   have been removed. `is_typeddict` now returns `False` when called with
   `TypedDict` itself as the argument. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Declare support for Python 3.12. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Fix tests on Python 3.13, which removes support for creating
   `TypedDict` classes through the keyword-argument syntax. Patch by
   Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Fix a regression introduced in v4.6.3 that meant that
   ``issubclass(object, typing_extensions.Protocol)`` would erroneously raise
   ``TypeError``. Patch by Alex Waygood (backporting the CPython PR
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105239).
 - Allow `Protocol` classes to inherit from `typing_extensions.Buffer` or
   `collections.abc.Buffer`. Patch by Alex Waygood (backporting
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/104827, by Jelle Zijlstra).
 - Allow classes to inherit from both `typing.Protocol` and `typing_extensions.Protocol`
   simultaneously. Since v4.6.0, this caused `TypeError` to be raised due to a
   metaclass conflict. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Backport several deprecations from CPython relating to unusual ways to
   create `TypedDict`s and `NamedTuple`s. CPython PRs #105609 and #105780
   by Alex Waygood; `typing_extensions` backport by Jelle Zijlstra.
   - Creating a `NamedTuple` using the functional syntax with keyword arguments
     (`NT = NamedTuple("NT", a=int)`) is now deprecated.
   - Creating a `NamedTuple` with zero fields using the syntax `NT = NamedTuple("NT")`
     or `NT = NamedTuple("NT", None)` is now deprecated.
   - Creating a `TypedDict` with zero fields using the syntax `TD = TypedDict("TD")`
     or `TD = TypedDict("TD", None)` is now deprecated.
 - Fix bug on Python 3.7 where a protocol `X` that had a member `a` would not be
   considered an implicit subclass of an unrelated protocol `Y` that only has a
   member `a`. Where the members of `X` are a superset of the members of `Y`,
   `X` should always be considered a subclass of `Y` iff `Y` is a
   runtime-checkable protocol that only has callable members. Patch by Alex
   Waygood (backporting CPython PR
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105835).
- update to version 4.6.3 (June 1, 2023)
 - Fix a regression introduced in v4.6.0 in the implementation of
   runtime-checkable protocols. The regression meant
   that doing `class Foo(X, typing_extensions.Protocol)`, where `X` was a class that
   had `abc.ABCMeta` as its metaclass, would then cause subsequent
   `isinstance(1, X)` calls to erroneously raise `TypeError`. Patch by
   Alex Waygood (backporting the CPython PR
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/105152).
 - Sync the repository's LICENSE file with that of CPython.
   `typing_extensions` is distributed under the same license as
   CPython itself.
 - Skip a problematic test on Python 3.12.0b1. The test fails on 3.12.0b1 due to
   a bug in CPython, which will be fixed in 3.12.0b2. The
   `typing_extensions` test suite now passes on 3.12.0b1.
- update to version 4.6.2:
 - Fix use of `@deprecated` on classes with `__new__` but no `__init__`.
   Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Fix regression in version 4.6.1 where comparing a generic class against a
   runtime-checkable protocol using `isinstance()` would cause `AttributeError`
   to be raised if using Python 3.7.
- update to version 4.6.1:
 - Change deprecated `@runtime` to formal API `@runtime_checkable` in the error
   message. Patch by Xuehai Pan.
 - Fix regression in 4.6.0 where attempting to define a `Protocol` that was
   generic over a `ParamSpec` or a `TypeVarTuple` would cause `TypeError` to be
   raised. Patch by Alex Waygood.
- update to version 4.6.0:
 - `typing_extensions` is now documented at
   https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Add `typing_extensions.Buffer`, a marker class for buffer types, as proposed
   by PEP 688. Equivalent to `collections.abc.Buffer` in Python 3.12. Patch by
   Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Backport two CPython PRs fixing various issues with `typing.Literal`:
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23294 and
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23383. Both CPython PRs were
   originally by Yurii Karabas, and both were backported to Python >=3.9.1, but
   no earlier. Patch by Alex Waygood.
   A side effect of one of the changes is that equality comparisons of `Literal`
   objects will now raise a `TypeError` if one of the `Literal` objects being
   compared has a mutable parameter. (Using mutable parameters with `Literal` is
   not supported by PEP 586 or by any major static type checkers.)
 - `Literal` is now reimplemented on all Python versions <= 3.10.0. The
   `typing_extensions` version does not suffer from the bug that was fixed in
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/29334. (The CPython bugfix was
   backported to CPython 3.10.1 and 3.9.8, but no earlier.)
 - Backport [CPython PR 26067](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/26067)
   (originally by Yurii Karabas), ensuring that `isinstance()` calls on
   protocols raise `TypeError` when the protocol is not decorated with
   `@runtime_checkable`. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Backport several significant performance improvements to runtime-checkable
   protocols that have been made in Python 3.12 (see
   https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74690 for details). Patch by Alex
   Waygood.
   A side effect of one of the performance improvements is that the members of
   a runtime-checkable protocol are now considered “frozen” at runtime as soon
   as the class has been created. Monkey-patching attributes onto a
   runtime-checkable protocol will still work, but will have no impact on
   `isinstance()` checks comparing objects to the protocol. See
   ["What's New in Python 3.12"](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#typing)
   for more details.
 - `isinstance()` checks against runtime-checkable protocols now use
   `inspect.getattr_static()` rather than `hasattr()` to lookup whether
   attributes exist (backporting https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/103034).
   This means that descriptors and `__getattr__` methods are no longer
   unexpectedly evaluated during `isinstance()` checks against runtime-checkable
   protocols. However, it may also mean that some objects which used to be
   considered instances of a runtime-checkable protocol on older versions of
   `typing_extensions` may no longer be considered instances of that protocol
   using the new release, and vice versa. Most users are unlikely to be affected
   by this change. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Backport the ability to define `__init__` methods on Protocol classes, a
   change made in Python 3.11 (originally implemented in
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/31628 by Adrian Garcia Badaracco).
   Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Speedup `isinstance(3, typing_extensions.SupportsIndex)` by >10x on Python
   <3.12. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Add `typing_extensions` versions of `SupportsInt`, `SupportsFloat`,
   `SupportsComplex`, `SupportsBytes`, `SupportsAbs` and `SupportsRound`. These
   have the same semantics as the versions from the `typing` module, but
   `isinstance()` checks against the `typing_extensions` versions are >10x faster
   at runtime on Python <3.12. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Add `__orig_bases__` to non-generic TypedDicts, call-based TypedDicts, and
   call-based NamedTuples. Other TypedDicts and NamedTuples already had the attribute.
   Patch by Adrian Garcia Badaracco.
 - Add `typing_extensions.get_original_bases`, a backport of
   [`types.get_original_bases`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/types.html#types.get_original_bases),
   introduced in Python 3.12 (CPython PR
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/101827, originally by James
   Hilton-Balfe). Patch by Alex Waygood.
   This function should always produce correct results when called on classes
   constructed using features from `typing_extensions`. However, it may
   produce incorrect results when called on some `NamedTuple` or `TypedDict`
   classes that use `typing.{NamedTuple,TypedDict}` on Python <=3.11.
 - Constructing a call-based `TypedDict` using keyword arguments for the fields
   now causes a `DeprecationWarning` to be emitted. This matches the behaviour
   of `typing.TypedDict` on 3.11 and 3.12.
 - Backport the implementation of `NewType` from 3.10 (where it is implemented
   as a class rather than a function). This allows user-defined `NewType`s to be
   pickled. Patch by Alex Waygood.
 - Fix tests and import on Python 3.12, where `typing.TypeVar` can no longer be
   subclassed. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Add `typing_extensions.TypeAliasType`, a backport of `typing.TypeAliasType`
   from PEP 695. Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.
 - Backport changes to the repr of `typing.Unpack` that were made in order to
   implement [PEP 692](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/) (backport of
   https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/104048). Patch by Alex Waygood.
