New upstream release 1.9.0

#### Breaking Changes

Because the version of typeshed we use in mypy 1.9 doesn't support 3.7, neither does mypy 1.9. (Jared Hance, PR [16883](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16883))

We are planning to enable
[local partial types](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-local-partial-types) (enabled via the
`--local-partial-types` flag) later this year by default. This change
was announced years ago, but now it's finally happening. This is a
major backward-incompatible change, so we'll probably include it as
part of the upcoming mypy 2.0 release. This makes daemon and
non-daemon mypy runs have the same behavior by default.

Local partial types can also be enabled in the mypy config file:
```
local_partial_types = True
```

We are looking at providing a tool to make it easier to migrate
projects to use `--local-partial-types`, but it's not yet clear whether
this is practical. The migration usually involves adding some
explicit type annotations to module-level and class-level variables.

#### Basic Support for Type Parameter Defaults (PEP 696)

This release contains new experimental support for type parameter
defaults ([PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696)). Please try it
out! This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller.

Since this feature will be officially introduced in the next Python
feature release (3.13), you will need to import `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec`
or `TypeVarTuple` from `typing_extensions` to use defaults for now.

This example adapted from the PEP defines a default for `BotT`:
```python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar

class Bot: ...

BotT = TypeVar("BotT", bound=Bot, default=Bot)

class Context(Generic[BotT]):
    bot: BotT

class MyBot(Bot): ...

# type is Bot (the default)
reveal_type(Context().bot)
# type is MyBot
reveal_type(Context[MyBot]().bot)
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 13 06:30:29 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 1.5.0:
 - Drop Support for Python 3.7
  - Mypy no longer supports running with Python 3.7, which has reached end-of-life. This was contributed by Shantanu (PR 15566).
 - Optional Check to Require Explicit @override
  - If you enable the explicit-override error code, mypy will generate an error if a method override doesn’t use the @typing.override decorator (as discussed in PEP 698). This way mypy will detect accidentally introduced overrides.
  - You can enable the error code via --enable-error-code=explicit-override on the mypy command line or enable_error_code = explicit-override in the mypy config file.
  - The override decorator will be available in typing in Python 3.12, but you can also use the backport from a recent version of typing_extensions on all supported Python versions.
 - More Flexible TypedDict Creation and Update
  - Mypy was previously overly strict when type checking TypedDict creation and update operations. Though these checks were often technically correct, they sometimes triggered for apparently valid code. These checks have now been relaxed by default. You can enable stricter checking by using the new --extra-checks flag.
 - Deprecated Flag: --strict-concatenate
  - The behavior of --strict-concatenate is now included in the new --extra-checks flag, and the old flag is deprecated.
  - Optionally Show Links to Error Code Documentation
  - If you use --show-error-code-links, mypy will add documentation links to (many) reported errors. The links are not shown for error messages that are sufficiently obvious, and they are shown once per error code only.
 - Consistently Avoid Type Checking Unreachable Code
  - If a module top level has unreachable code, mypy won’t type check the unreachable statements. This is consistent with how functions behave. The behavior of --warn-unreachable is also more consistent now.
 - Experimental Improved Type Inference for Generic Functions
  - You can use --new-type-inference to opt into an experimental new type inference algorithm. It fixes issues when calling a generic functions with an argument that is also a generic function, in particular. This current implementation is still incomplete, but we encourage trying it out and reporting bugs if you encounter regressions. We are planning to enable the new algorithm by default in a future mypy release.
 - Partial Support for Python 3.12
  - Mypy and mypyc now support running on recent Python 3.12 development versions. Not all new Python 3.12 features are supported, and we don’t ship compiled wheels for Python 3.12 yet.
 - Improvements to Dataclasses
  - Improve signature of dataclasses.replace (Ilya Priven, PR 14849)
  - Fix dataclass/protocol crash on joining types (Ilya Priven, PR 15629)
  - Fix strict optional handling in dataclasses (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR 15571)

  - Add __slots__ attribute to dataclasses (Nikita Sobolev, PR 15649)
  - Support better __post_init__ method signature for dataclasses (Nikita Sobolev, PR 15503)
 - Mypyc Improvements
  - Support unsigned 8-bit native integer type: mypy_extensions.u8 (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 15564)
  - Support signed 16-bit native integer type: mypy_extensions.i16 (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 15464)
  - Define mypy_extensions.i16 in stubs (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 15562)
  - Document more unsupported features and update supported features (Richard Si, PR 15524)

  - Fix frozen_default in incremental mode (Wesley Collin Wright)
  - Fix frozen behavior for base classes with direct metaclasses (Wesley Collin Wright, PR 14878)
 - Mypyc: Native Floats
  - Mypyc now uses a native, unboxed representation for values of type float. Previously these were heap-allocated Python objects. Native floats are faster and use less memory. Code that uses floating-point operations heavily can be several times faster when using native floats.
  - Various float operations and math functions also now have optimized implementations. Refer to the documentation for a full list.
  - This can change the behavior of existing code that uses subclasses of float. When assigning an instance of a subclass of float to a variable with the float type, it gets implicitly converted to a float instance when compiled
  - Previously, implicit conversions were applied to int subclasses but not float subclasses.
  - Also, int values can no longer be assigned to a variable with type float in compiled code, since these types now have incompatible representations. An explicit conversion is required.
  - This restriction only applies to assignments, since they could otherwise narrow down the type of a variable from float to int. int values can still be implicitly converted to float when passed as arguments to functions that expect float values.
  - Note that mypyc still doesn’t support arrays of unboxed float values. Using list[float] involves heap-allocated float objects, since list can only store boxed values. Support for efficient floating point arrays is one of the next major planned mypyc features.
  - Related changes:
   - Use a native unboxed representation for floats (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 14880)
   - Document native floats and integers (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 14927)
   - Fixes to float to int conversion (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 14936)
 - Mypyc: Native Integers
  - Mypyc now supports signed 32-bit and 64-bit integer types in addition to the arbitrary-precision int type. You can use the types mypy_extensions.i32 and mypy_extensions.i64 to speed up code that uses integer operations heavily.
  - Refer to the documentation for more information. This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.

- Update Requirements
- Add mypy-pr13259-walrus.patch -- gh#python/mypy#13259
  * fix test failures with Python >= 3.10.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  6 14:10:01 UTC 2022 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.971:
  - Last Release Officially Supporting Python 2 and 3.6:
    - Support for Python 2 will be completely removed in the next
      mypy feature release after this one, mypy 0.980.
    - Support for Python 3.6 will also be dropped in mypy 0.980,
      since Python 3.6 has reached its end of life. It will be
      still possible to target Python 3.6 using --python-version
      in future mypy versions, but no bugs will be fixed that
      affect only Python 3.6 (unless they are regressions). Also
      note that typeshed just recently dropped Python 3.6
      support, so standard library features only available in
      Python 3.6 will not be supported.

Tue Jun 21 09:00:36 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- remove obsolete patch 12452-stringent-err-msg.patch
- update to version 0.960:
 - Recognise typing.LiteralString and typing_extensions.LiteralString as aliases to str.
 - This does not add proper support for LiteralString, but this allows it to be used in type annotations and stubs. LiteralString will be included in Python 3.11 (PEP 675), and it can be used to require that a value is an arbitrary literal string (once fully supported).
 - Per-file Timing Stats
 - When mypy is run with the (currently hidden) --timing-stats FILE option, mypy will record detailed information about time spent type checking each file (microseconds). When profiling mypy runs over a large codebase, it can be useful to know which files are the slowest to type check. We are happy to receive bug reports about unexpectedly slow type checking.
 - Performance Improvements
  - Cache type of container literals when possible (Hugues, PR 12707)
  - Speed up type checking of nested if expressions (Hugues, PR 12700)
  - Speed up type checking of container literals with tuple entries (Hugues, PR 12706)
  - Speed up argument count check (Hugues, PR 12703)
  - Speed up processing large error counts and improve error filtering (Hugues, PR 12631)
 - Experimental Fast Module Lookup
 - Use the new --fast-module-lookup to switch to an alternative import resolution implementation that is faster when a large number of folders share a top-level namespace. We’d like to hear if you notice an improvement when using this flag, so that we can potentially prioritize work to enable this by default.
 - Documentation Updates
  - Add information about classes and types to “Getting started” (Michael Lee, PR 6557)
  - Mention no_type_check decorator in documentation (Shantanu, PR 12713)
  - Remove most mentions of type comments from docs (Shantanu, PR 12683)
  - Use PEP 585 syntax in "The type of class objects" (Alex Waygood, PR 12516)
 - Improvements to Plugin System
  - Add a class attribute hook to the plugin system (Danny Weinberg, PR 9881)
  - Add an alternative class decorator hook that is less error-prone than the old one (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12762)
 - ParamSpec Improvements
  - Friendlier errors for ParamSpec (PEP 612) (Shantanu, PR 12832)
  - Fix ParamSpec crash related to Any types (EXPLOSION, PR 12548)
  - Use tuple[object, ...] and dict[str, object] as upper bounds for ParamSpec.args and ParamSpec.kwargs (Alex Waygood, PR 12668)
 - Fixes to Crashes
  - Fix crash on invalid Python executable (Pranav Rajpal, PR 12812)
  - Fix crash on type alias definition inside dataclass declaration (Alex Waygood, PR 12792)
  - Fix crash related to namedtuple in unannotated function (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12804)
  - Fix nested namedtuple crash in incremental mode (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12803)
  - Fix forward references and generic inheritance in attrs classes (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12772)
  - mypyc: Fix TypeError in lambda argument to overloaded function (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12780)
  - Fix crashes related to functools.total_ordering and forward references (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12767)
  - Fix crashes related to dataclasses and forward references (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12762)
  - Fix crash on invalid TypedDict definition (Alex Waygood, PR 12741)
  - Fix crash when using decorator in class scope (dzcode, PR 12724)
 - Other Notable Fixes and Improvements
  - Fix type annotation support of dunder methods in stubgen (Fabian Keller, PR 12828)
  - Fix some value patterns in match statements to be non-exhaustive (Štěpán Horáček, PR 12751)
  - Generate error when using both abstractmethod and final (Tomoki Nakagawa, PR 12743)
  - Add more precise error message for Callable annotation (frerikandriessen, PR 12518)
  - Fix generic inference in functions with TypeGuard (Nikita Sobolev, PR 11797)
  - Add check if python_version was parsed as float in pyproject.toml (Marcel Otoboni, PR 12558)
  - Fix nested overload merging (Marc Mueller, PR 12607)
  - stubtest: Generate error if type alias doesn't exist at runtime (Alex Waygood, PR 12608)
  - Support typing_extensions.overload (Jelle Zijlstra, PR 12602)
- update to version 0.950:
 - Recent third-party library stubs available via types-* packages (e.g. types-requests) are actively using recent typing features that may not be supported by older mypy releases. We recommend that if you pin mypy to a specific version, you should also pin any stub packages to a version no more recent than the mypy release. Otherwise the mypy version you use may silently fall back to Any types if it encounters annotation syntax that it can’t process. It’s fine to continue using older versions of stubs when you upgrade mypy.
 - Note also that recent versions of many third-party stub packages don’t support Python 2 any more. If you are using mypy to type check Python 2 code, it’s important to pin all stub packages to versions that still support Python 2. Generally stub package versions: in Feb 2022 or earlier still support Python 2 (assuming that they supported Python 2 at all).
 - New Features: Concatenate and Literals with ParamSpec
 - It’s now possible to precisely annotate decorators that add/remove arguments, using ParamSpec together with typing.Concatenate (Python 3.10 or later) or typing_extensions.Concatenate. The decorator in this example provides an implicit Request argument to the decorated function.
 - New Feature: Detect Unused Coroutines and Awaitables
 - Now mypy will give an error if you forget to await a coroutine:
 - If you enable the unused-awaitable error code, mypy will also complain about any unused value that supports __await__. This is not enabled by default, since this can cause false positives.
 - New Feature: assert_type
 - You can now use typing_extensions.assert_type to ask mypy to validate that an expression has a specific static type. Mypy will report an error if the inferred type is not as expected:
  - from typing_extensions import assert_type
  - assert_type([1], list[int])  # OK
  - # Error: Expression is of type "List[int]", not "List[str]"
  - assert_type([1], list[str])
 - This can be used to validate that the expected type is inferred by mypy when calling a complex overloaded function, for example. At runtime assert_type just returns the first argument and doesn’t perform a runtime type check.
 - Mypyc Fixes and Improvements
  - Fix overflow in id built-in (Ekin Dursun, PR 12332)
  - Simplify generated code for native attribute get (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 11978)
  - Implement close method for generators (Max Shvets, PR 12042)
  - Use more accurate flags with msvc (KotlinIsland, PR 12468)
  - Fix potential memory leak with setdefault() (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12514)
  - Make boxed integer constants/literals faster (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12507)
 - Performance Improvements
 - Mypy now type checks somewhat faster, in particular when dealing with enums and unions with many items.
  - Speed up union types (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12541, PR 12519)
  - Speed up subtype checks (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12540, PR 12538, PR 12536, PR 12539)
  - Speed up type checking enums (Hugues, PR 12032)
  - Speed up union types further (Hugues, PR 12630)

  - Use Furo theme for documentation (97littleleaf11, PR 12348)
  - Add missing enable_error_code to config documentation (Mathieu Kniewallner, PR 12346)
  - Correct example in “Annotation issues at runtime” (Alex Waygood, PR 12356)

 - Stubgen Improvements
  - Fix handling of Protocol (citruz, PR 12129)
  - Use _typeshed.Incomplete instead of typing.Any (Sebastian Rittau, PR 12449)
  - Do not consider nested generators (Štěpán Horáček, PR 12463)
  - Fix behavior for instance variables in C extensions (Shubham SInghal, PR 12524)
 - Stubtest Improvements
  - Generate error for read-only property at runtime, but not in stub (Alex Waygood, PR 12291)
  - Enable verification of __match_args__ attributes (Alex Waygood, PR 12465)
 - Other Notable Fixes and Improvements
  - Use tomllib on Python 3.11 (Shantanu, PR 12305)
  - Print compilation status with --version (Shantanu, PR 12318)

  - Fix __slots__ and __deletable__ in incremental mode (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR 12645)

Mon Mar 14 21:44:08 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.941:
 - No changelog available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 14 21:35:28 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.940:
 - Match Statement
   Mypy now has experimental support for type checking match statements introduced in Python 3.10.
 - Python 2 End-of-Life Schedule
   After this release, Python 2 support is in feature freeze. Mypy won’t add new features or fixes specific to type checking Python 2 code, expect for fixes of significant regressions.
   Mypy will drop Python 2 support in the second half of 2022.
   Important note: Since typeshed is in the process of removing Python 2 specific stubs, you should pin all installed typeshed stub packages for third-party libraries to a version from Feb 2022 or earlier if you want to type check Python 2 code.

 - New Feature: Explicit Type Aliases (PEP 613)
  - You can now explicitly mark an assignment as a type alias, by using typing.TypeAlias
  - For more context, see the docs or PEP 613.
 - New Feature: NotRequired in TypedDicts
  - You can now define individual TypedDict items as non-required by using typing_extensions.NotRequired. Previously this could only be configured at TypedDict level (by using total=).
  - You can also use typing_extensions.Required to mark an item as required in a non-total TypedDict.
 - New Feature: ParamSpec (Experimental)
  - Mypy now partially support ParamSpec, which was introduced in Python 3.10. This makes it possible to define type variables that range over the parameter specification of a callable type. In particular, it allows giving precise types for some decorators that change the return type of the decorated function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 08:04:39 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 0.920:
 - Making a Variable Optional in an Else Block
  - Now mypy alllows more general conditionally defined variables with optional types. Previously mypy allowed this only if a None assignment happened first. Now this is also supported. Implemented by Michael J. Sullivan in PR 11002.
 - Type Checking __slots__ Assignment
  - For classes that define the special __slots__ attribute, mypy will now report an error on assigning to attributes that are not found in the slots definitions (this matches runtime semantics).
  - Note that this feature does not work for dynamically computed slots. Implemented by Nikita Sobolev in PR 10864.
 - Partial Python 3.10 Support
  - We now ship binary wheels for Python 3.10 and mypy supports the new Python 3.10 union type syntax.
  - Some new features, including the match statement, ParamSpec and TypeAlias are not supported yet.
 - Python 3.5 Is No Longer Supported
  - Python 3.5 reached its end of life more than a year ago. Its support was deprecated in mypy 0.910 and it is no longer supported in mypy 0.920.
 - Efficient String and Bytes Formatting in Mypyc
  - Most string and bytes formatting methods now use fast C-level logic when compiled with mypyc. This includes % formatting, the format() method, and f-strings. This was implemented by 97littleleaf11 as part of a Google Summer of Code project.
 - Work Towards singledispatch Support
  - The signature of the initial function variant handles the generic case and describes the external signature of the singledispatch function.
  - This was implemented Pranav Rajpal as part of a Google Summer of Code project.

Sun Jul  4 20:06:55 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.910:
  - Mypy 0.900 added --install-types to install missing stub packages. We received feedback that this wasn’t a good fit for all use cases, since it asks for interactive confirmation from the user, and it requires another mypy invocation to actually perform type checking.
  - This release adds the new option --non-interactive that can be used with --install-types to install suggested stub packages without asking for confirmation. This can be useful in Continuous Integration jobs. The option causes mypy to both install stub packages and perform type checking within a single invocation. When not using --non-interactive, you’d have to run mypy again to get up-to-date results with the installed stubs.
  - This option provides a new way to migrate existing mypy runner scripts after updating to mypy 0.9xx: just add the --install-types --non-interactive options to your mypy command line.
  - Note that --install-types currently always installs the latest stubs for all supported packages. If you want reproducible results from your builds, we recommend explicitly pinning stub package versions in your requirements.txt file, for example.
 - Python 3.5 Deprecation
  - Running mypy on Python 3.5 is now deprecated. A future mypy release will drop Python 3.5 support. We haven’t decided when this will happen, but this might happen in the next feature release after 0.910.
 - Stubgen Improvements
  - Don't annotate unknown argument and return types (Sebastian Rittau, PR 10626)
 - Never generate a variable initializer (Sebastian Rittau, PR 10623)
 - Use NamedTuple class syntax (Sebastian Rittau, PR 10625)
 - Use T | None (PEP 604) instead of Optional[T] (Sebastian Rittau, PR 10624)
  - Other Fixes and Improvements

 - Update docs for deferral of PEP 563 to 3.11 (Smart, PR 10655)
 - Don't suggest to install stubs for packages with py.typed files (Sebastian Rittau, PR 10652)
 - Correct the type package name of pyopenssl ( Sebastian Rittau, PR 10656)

 - Don't ask to install a stub package if stubs are installed (PR 10670)
 - Fix crash when inferring multiple assignment with overloaded function (PR 10689)
- update to version 0.900:
  - Third-party Library Stubs in Stub Packages (Breaking Change)
  - Mypy now only ships with type stubs for stdlib modules (plus typing_extensions and mypy_extensions). If you use third-party libraries that don’t include stubs or inline type annotations, you can explicitly install stub packages, usually called types-<name>.
  - You can also now run mypy --install-types to install all missing stub packages in the mypy run (or the previous run, if you don’t pass any files to check).
 - Using cached types_requests-0.1.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl (22 kB)
  - For more information, read the blog post about this change and why we did this. There is more detail in the docs.
 - Python 2 Support is Opt-in (Breaking Change)
  - If you want to type check Python 2 code, you now have to install mypy[python2] using pip (on Python 3.8 and later):
  - python3 -m pip install -U mypy[python2]
  - This will install the additional typed-ast pip dependency that is required for Python 2 support. Type checking Python 2 code is still fully supported by mypy.
  - TypeGuard
  - Mypy now supports defining user-defined functions that perform type narrowing, similar to isinstance. Read PEP 647 for the details.
  - Since TypeGuard will be included in Python 3.10, which hasn’t been released yet, you will have to import it from a recent version of typing_extensions for now.
  - Support for pyproject.toml
  - Binary Wheels for Apple Silicon
  - We now include binary wheels for Apple Silicon. This can make mypy runs over 4x faster on supported hardware. This requires a native Apple Silicon build of Python 3.9 to work.
  - Type Narrowing with type(x)
  - Hosted Documentation for Mypyc
  - We now have hosted user documentation for mypyc, the compiler we use to speed up mypy. Mypyc is still experimental, but we are looking for early adopters.

- update to version0.812L
 - Improved Source File Finding
  - Mypy 0.800 changed how mypy finds modules if you run mypy as mypy directory/ or mypy -p package. Mypy started looking for source files in directories without a __init__.py file. This is often the expected behavior, and it avoids excluding some files that should be type checked.
  - However, this caused issues for some users, such as when using mypy . to type check all files under the current directory. Mypy could now try to type check files inside nested virtual environments and node_modules directories, which is usually not desirable. This could result in mypy needlessly complaining about duplicate module names, in particular.
  - Now mypy will skip directories named site-packages or node_modules, and any directory beginning with a dot (such as .git) when recursively looking for files to check.
  - This doesn’t affect how mypy resolves imports — it only affects when mypy is given a directory or a package to type check. You can override the exclusions by explicitly passing the files on the command line.
  - Excluding Paths
  - Mypy now supports the --exclude regex command line option to exclude paths matching a regular expression when searching for files to type check. For example, mypy --exclude '/setup\.py$' skips all setup.py files. This lets you exclude additional paths that mypy started finding after mypy 0.800 changed module finding behavior, as discussed above.
  - You can also specify this in the config file (exclude=regex). The option expects forward slashes as directory separators on all platforms, including Windows, for consistency.

- Update to version 0.800:
 - Python 3.9 Support
 - Typing Usability Improvements (PEP 585 and PEP 604)
   The necessity to repeatedly import various types and special forms from typing has been a long-term nuisance for users of static type checking and Python.
   Two new Python features improve this situation and are now supported by mypy:
       PEP 585 lets you use list[int] instead of List[int] (no need to import List and other generic collections from typing).
       PEP 604 lets you write X | Y instead of Union[X, Y], and X | None instead of Optional[X] (no need to import Union or Optional from typing).
   Note: Using list[int] requires Python 3.9 and X | Y requires Python 3.10 (alpha) in order to work at runtime. To use them on older versions of Python, use from __future__ import annotations. This allows them to be used in type annotations, but the older variants (or string literal escaping) may be required in non-annotation contexts, such as in type aliases. See the docs for more details.
   Here is an example that uses the new features:
       from __future__ import annotations
       def fields(s: str | None) -> list[str]:
           if not s:
               return []
           else:
               return s.split(',')
   These were implemented by Allan Daemon in PR 9564 and by Marc Mueller in PR 9647.
 - Improvements to Finding Modules
   This release adds several improvements to how mypy finds Python source files to type check.
   You can now pass paths to files within namespace packages on the command line, and mypy can better infer their module names. As before, use --namespace-packages to enable namespace packages.
   When you use --explicit-package-bases together with --namespace-packages, mypy assumes that only the current directory and directories explicitly specified in MYPYPATH (or mypy_path in the config file) are valid package roots. This can help with situations where the module name of a file is ambiguous. For example, it may not be clear whether src/pkg/mod.py should be treated as src.pkg.mod or pkg.mod, and you can use this option to disambiguate between the two (more information in the docs).
   The above improvements were implemented in PR 9742 by Shantanu.
   Other related improvements (also implemented by Shantanu):
  - When you run mypy as mypy <directory>, look for source files recursively also inside directories without a __init__.py (PR 9614)
  - Support namespace packages with -p (PR 9683)

- update to version 0.780:
 - Following Imports in Mypy Daemon
  - You can now leave out the --follow-imports option when running dmypy, and mypy daemon will follow imports, similar to a non-daemon mypy run.

 - Typeshed Updates
  - Many small improvements were made to typeshed — too many to list. Browse the typeshed commit log here.
- update to version 0.770:
 - Tagged Unions
  - Previously, the only way to distinguish between two types in a union was to use an isinstance check. Now, mypy supports distinguishing between two or more types based on the value of some common shared "tag" field.
    This feature is most useful when you want to narrow down a union of TypedDicts: since TypedDicts are really just regular dicts at runtime, using isinstance checks won't work. Instead, you can now label or tag each TypedDict with a distinct Literal type and discriminate by checking that tag.
    Note that you can import Literal from typing_extensions on Python 3.7 and earlier.
    You can also use this technique to discriminate between unions of objects, tuples, or named tuples, so long as: 1. Every item in your union is tagged with a unique value 2. Mypy understands how to narrow the union of the tag values.
    For more details and examples, see the documentation on tagged unions.
 - Type Inference Improvements
   Type inference is now more powerful. Mypy can infer types in some cases where you previously needed an explicit type annotation.
   Mypy can infer a built-in collection type from augmented assignment statements.
   Some dictionary construction idioms are better supported.
   Mypy is better at inferring defaultdict types.
 - Multiple Inheritance and isinstance() Checks
   Previously, mypy assumed a variable cannot have two unrelated types when analyzing isinstance checks. For example, in the following example B is not a subclass of A, so mypy would incorrectly conclude the isinstance check is always false, and that the if-branch is unreachable — even though var could actually be a subtype of both types.
   This meant that mypy skipped type checking anything inside the if statement, since it (by design) skips analyzing unreachable branches.
   Now, mypy will instead decide that the narrowed type of x is test.<subclass of "A" and "B">, instead of marking the branch as unreachable.
   If it’s impossible for two types to be a subtype of one another, mypy will continue to not attempt to infer this "ad-hoc intersection".
 - Other Notable Improvements and Bug Fixes:

  - Document --local-partial-types (Xuanda Yang, PR 8201)
  - Update documentation for Literal types (Michael Lee, PR 8152)
 - Stubtest rewrite
   stubtest is a tool that compares stub definitions to what it finds at runtime with introspection and reports back inconsistencies. It got a complete rewrite. Some features of the new stubtest are:
  - Find missing, extraneous or mistyped classes, methods, functions and attributes in the stubs
  - Check presence, names and kinds of function arguments, accounting for overloads, decorators, *args and kwargs. Checks argument types against their default values, accounting for type vars.
  - Checks @property, @classmethod, @staticmethod declarations
  - Check types of module level and class level attributes and enums
 - Some results of this:
  - We now run stubtest in typeshed CI (for stdlib)
  - We’ve fixed about 1900 issues in typeshed definitions
  - We’ve greatly improved Python 3.8 support in typeshed and it’ll be easier to make the changes needed for future Python versions
  - We’ve uncovered a handful of issues in Python itself
