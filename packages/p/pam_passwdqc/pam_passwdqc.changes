- Update to passwdqc 1.3.1
  * The rarely used "non-unix" option to pam_passwdqc was broken
    (uninitialized pointer): when that option was enabled,
    pam_passwdqc would either segfault or potentially wrongly
    conclude that a password is based on the user's information
    (false positive detection of weak password).

- Update to version 1.3.0
  * Detection of common character sequences has been improved.  This has
    reduced the number of passing passwords for RockYou top 100k from
    35 to 18, and for RockYou top 1M from 2333 to 2273 (all of these are
    with passwdqc's default policy).  I also tested on lists of cracked and
    not cracked passwords and reviewed the results manually to ensure
    there's no significant increase in false positives.
  * Generation of random passphrases with non-default settings has been
    improved: case toggling has been made optional, possible use of trailing
    single characters has been added, words are now separated with dashes
    when different separator characters are not in use, and the range of
    possible bit sizes of generated passphrases has been expanded (now it is
    24 to 85 bits for the programs, and 24 to 136 bits for the API).
    The code has been made more robust: possible NULL pointer returns from
    crypt(3) are handled correctly, all pre-initialized arrays and structs
    are declared as "const", greater use of cpp macros for integer constants
    and some source code comments were added (mostly in passwdqc_random.c).
  * Darwin (Mac OS X) support has been added to the Makefile
  * pwqcheck.php, a PHP wrapper function around the pwqcheck program, has
    been added.
- Use download Url as source
- Remove redundant %clean section

- update to version 1.2.2
- When matching against the reversed new password, always pass the
  original non-reversed new password (possibly with a substring
  removed) into is_simple(), but remove or check the correct
  substring in is_based() considering that the matching is possibly
  being done against the reversed password.
- New command-line options for pwqcheck: -1 and -2 for reading just
  1 and just 2 lines from stdin, respectively (instead of reading 3
  lines, which is the default), --multi for checking multiple
  passphrases at once (until EOF).
- With randomly-generated passphrases, encode more entropy per
  separator character (by increasing the number of different
  separators from 8 to 16) and per word (by altering the case of
  the first letter of each word), which increases the default
  generated passphrase size from 42 to 47 bits.
- Substring matching has been enhanced to partially discount rather
  than fully remove weak substrings, support leetspeak, and detect
  some common sequences of characters (sequential digits, letters in
  alphabetical order, adjacent keys on a QWERTY keyboard).
- Detect and allow passphrases with non-ASCII characters in the words.
- A number of optimizations have been made resulting in significant
  speedup of passwdqc_check() on real-world passwords.

Thu Apr  3 11:31:34 CEST 2008 - mc@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.5
  - Replaced the separator characters with some of those defined by RFC 3986
    as being safe within "userinfo" part of URLs without encoding.
  - Reduced the default value for the N2 parameter to min=... (the minimum
    length for passphrases) from 12 to 11.
  - Corrected the potentially misleading description of N2 (Debian bug #310595).
  - Applied minor grammar and style corrections to the documentation, a
    pam_passwdqc message, and source code comments.
  - Changed Makefile to pass list of libraries to linker after regular
    object files, to fix build with -Wl,--as-needed.
  - Fixed potential memory leak in conversation wrapper.
  - Restricted list of global symbols exported by the PAM module
    to standard set of six pam_sm_* functions.
