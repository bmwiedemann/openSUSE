  <title>Compress responses in your Flask app with gzip</title>
  <description>Flask-Compress allows you to easily compress your Flask application's
responses with gzip.

The preferred solution is to have a server (like Nginx) automatically
compress the static files for you. If you don't have that option
Flask-Compress will solve the problem for you.
