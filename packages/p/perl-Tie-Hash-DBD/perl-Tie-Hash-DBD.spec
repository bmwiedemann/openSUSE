%description
This module has been created to act as a drop-in replacement for modules
that tie straight perl hashes to disk, like 'DB_File'. When the running
system does not have enough memory to hold large hashes, and disk-tieing
won't work because there is not enough space, it works quite well to tie
the hash to a database, which preferable runs on a different server.

This module ties a hash to a database table using *only* a 'key' and a
'value' field. If no tables specification is passed, this will create a
temporary table with 'h_key' for the key field and a 'h_value' for the
value field.

I think it would make sense to merge the functionality that this module
provides into 'Tie::DBI'.
