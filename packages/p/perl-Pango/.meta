  <title>Pango Perl module</title>
  <description>Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis on
internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
needed, but using Pango in conjunction with L&lt;Cairo&gt; and/or L&lt;Gtk2&gt;
provides a complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics
rendering.

Dynamically loaded modules handle text layout for particular
combinations of script and font backend. Pango provides a wide selection
of modules, including modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, Thai, and a
number of Indic scripts. Virtually all of the world's major scripts are
supported.

In addition to the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
Pango::Layout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
and routines to assist in editing internationalized text.</description>
