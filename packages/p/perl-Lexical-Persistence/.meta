  <title>Persistent lexical variable values for arbitrary calls</title>
  <description>Lexical::Persistence does a few things, all related. Note that all the
behaviors listed here are the defaults. Subclasses can override nearly every
aspect of Lexical::Persistence's behavior.

Lexical::Persistence lets your code access persistent data through lexical
variables. This example prints &quot;some value&quot; because the value of $x perists in
the $lp object between setter() and getter().
