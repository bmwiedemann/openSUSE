  <title>MooseX::Role::WithOverloading</title>
  <description>
MooseX::Role::WithOverloading allows you to write a Moose::Role which defines overloaded operators and allows those operator overloadings to be composed into the classes/roles/instances it's compiled to, while plain Moose::Roles would lose the overloading.
