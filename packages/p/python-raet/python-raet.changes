   one of the joins and allows other to complete Bugfixes More tests

  - Lookup remote in stack handleOneRx by using packet.index since it already substitutes 
    ha if se is zero. Then also lookup remote in haRemotes if not found in .uidRemotes
  - Update joinent transaction
  - Change the way persistence reaping is handled. Instead of removing remote from memory, 
    mark it with .reaped attribute. This avoide problematic use case of having to restoreRemote
    from disk when doing lookup in Joinent. Update .manage
  - Also unreap anytime a packet is received from a remote

    keep file. Also more support for role.

  - Refactored odicts indexing access attributes for remotes so can now access by uid, by name, or by ha. 
  - Updated associated accessors Provides more consistent view onto Stack Road or Lane Prepatory to adding
