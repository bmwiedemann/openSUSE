- Update to 3.6.10 (still in line with jsc#SLE-9426,
  jsc#SLE-9427, bsc#1159035):
  - Security:
    - bpo-38945: Newline characters have been escaped when
      performing uu encoding to prevent them from overflowing
      into to content section of the encoded file. This prevents
      malicious or accidental modification of data during the
      decoding process.
    - bpo-37228: Due to significant security concerns, the
      reuse_address parameter of
      asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint() is no longer
      supported. This is because of the behavior of SO_REUSEADDR
      in UDP. For more details, see the documentation for
      loop.create_datagram_endpoint(). (Contributed by Kyle
      Stanley, Antoine Pitrou, and Yury Selivanov in bpo-37228.)
    - bpo-38804: Fixes a ReDoS vulnerability in http.cookiejar.
      Patch by Ben Caller.

      2.2.8, which resolves CVE-2019-15903.
    - bpo-37461: Fix an infinite loop when parsing specially
      crafted email headers. Patch by Abhilash Raj.
    - bpo-34155: Fix parsing of invalid email addresses with more
      than one @ (e.g. a@b@c.com.) to not return the part before
      2nd @ as valid email address. Patch by maxking &amp; jpic.
  - Library:
    - bpo-38216: Allow the rare code that wants to send invalid
      http requests from the http.client library a way to do so.
      The fixes for bpo-30458 led to breakage for some projects
      that were relying on this ability to test their own
      behavior in the face of bad requests.
    - bpo-36564: Fix infinite loop in email header folding logic
      that would be triggered when an email policy’s
      max_line_length is not long enough to include the required
      markup and any values in the message. Patch by Paul Ganssle

  http client request. Such potentially malicious header
  injection URLs now cause a ValueError to be raised.
- bsc#1129346: add CVE-2019-9636-urlsplit-NFKC-norm.patch
  Characters in the netloc attribute that decompose under NFKC
  normalization (as used by the IDNA encoding) into any of ``/``,
  ``?``, ``#``, ``@``, or ``:`` will raise a ValueError. If the
  URL is decomposed before parsing, or is not a Unicode string,
  no error will be raised. (CVE-2019-9636)
  Upstream gh#python/cpython#12224
- bsc#1120644 add CVE-2018-20406-pickle_LONG_BINPUT.patch fixing bpo#34656
  Modules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via
  a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a &quot;resize to twice
  the size&quot; attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is
  only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
  hundreds of gigabytes of data.
- bsc#1122191: add CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch
  fixing bpo-35746.
  An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
  X509 certificate parser of Python.org Python 2.7.11 / 3.7.2.
  A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a NULL pointer
  dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can
  initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates
  to trigger this vulnerability.
- Add -fwrapv to OPTS, which is default for python3 anyway
  See for example https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/issues/86
  for bugs which are caused by avoiding it. (bsc#1107030)
- Apply &quot;CVE-2018-1061-DOS-via-regexp-difflib.patch&quot; to prevent
  low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060) and to prevent difflib REDOS
  (CVE-2018-1061). Prior to this patch mail server's timestamp was
  susceptible to catastrophic backtracking on long evil response from
  the server. Also, it was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking,
  which was a potential DOS vector.
  [bsc#1088004 and bsc#1088009, CVE-2018-1061 and CVE-2018-1060]

    * many other new bugfixes and features, check NEWS for details
- pre_checkin.sh now autofills various version strings in specs
- ship hashlib's fallback modules - those uselessly take up space
  when real _hashlib.so from python3 is present, but the space wasted

  jsc#SLE-9427, bsc#1159035):
  - Security:
    - bpo-38945: Newline characters have been escaped when
      performing uu encoding to prevent them from overflowing
      into to content section of the encoded file. This prevents
      malicious or accidental modification of data during the
      decoding process.
    - bpo-37228: Due to significant security concerns, the
      reuse_address parameter of
      asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint() is no longer
      supported. This is because of the behavior of SO_REUSEADDR
      in UDP. For more details, see the documentation for
      loop.create_datagram_endpoint(). (Contributed by Kyle
      Stanley, Antoine Pitrou, and Yury Selivanov in bpo-37228.)
    - bpo-38804: Fixes a ReDoS vulnerability in http.cookiejar.
      Patch by Ben Caller.
    - bpo-38243: Escape the server title of

      than one @ (e.g. a@b@c.com.) to not return the part before
      2nd @ as valid email address. Patch by maxking &amp; jpic.
  - Library:
    - bpo-38216: Allow the rare code that wants to send invalid
      http requests from the http.client library a way to do so.
      The fixes for bpo-30458 led to breakage for some projects
      that were relying on this ability to test their own
      behavior in the face of bad requests.
    - bpo-36564: Fix infinite loop in email header folding logic
      that would be triggered when an email policy’s
      max_line_length is not long enough to include the required
      markup and any values in the message. Patch by Paul Ganssle
- Remove patches included in the upstream tarball:
  - CVE-2019-16935-xmlrpc-doc-server_title.patch (and also
    bpo37614-race_test_docxmlrpc_srv_setup.patch, which was
    resolving bsc#1174701).
  - CVE-2019-16056-email-parse-addr.patch
- Move idle subpackage build from python3-base to python3 (bsc#1159622).
  appstream-glib required for packaging introduces considerable
  extra dependencies and a build loop via rust/librsvg.

  + idle.png is not the target directory
  + non-GNOME-specific icons belong into icons/hicolor
- Add required Name key to idle3 desktop file
- Unify all Python 3.6* SLE packages into one (jsc#SLE-9426,

  Upstream gh#python/cpython#12224
- bsc#1120644 add CVE-2018-20406-pickle_LONG_BINPUT.patch fixing bpo#34656
  Modules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via
  a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a &quot;resize to twice
  the size&quot; attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is
  only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
  hundreds of gigabytes of data.
- bsc#1122191: add CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch
  fixing bpo-35746.
  An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
  X509 certificate parser of Python.org Python 2.7.11 / 3.7.2.
  A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a NULL pointer
  dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can
  initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates
  to trigger this vulnerability.
- Add -fwrapv to OPTS, which is default for python3 anyway
  See for example https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/issues/86
  for bugs which are caused by avoiding it. (bsc#1107030)
- Apply &quot;CVE-2018-1061-DOS-via-regexp-difflib.patch&quot; to prevent
  low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060) and to prevent difflib REDOS
  (CVE-2018-1061). Prior to this patch mail server's timestamp was
  susceptible to catastrophic backtracking on long evil response from
  the server. Also, it was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking,
  which was a potential DOS vector.

- merge python3-xml into python3
- merge python3-2to3 library into python3-base
  and the 2to3 binary into python3-devel
  (python3-devel is now in conflict with python-2to3, which
  will be dropped)
- enable --with-system-expat for python3, making the xml modules
  (and thus python3) depend on expat
- reconfigure tests to disable network and GUI resources, which
  the upstream apparently thought is a good idea to enable by default.
  this fixes build failures in Factory
- add lzma-devel to build the _lzma module
- moved %dynlib macro definition to common section
- buildrequire timezone for the test suite
- disable more checks for qemu builds as they use syscalls not
  implemented yet
- exclude test_math for SLE 11; math library fails on negative 
  gamma function values close to integers and 0, probably
  due to imprecision in -lm on SLE_11_SP2. 
- buildrequire libbz2-devel explicitly
- remove distutils.cfg (bnc#658604)
  * this changes default prefix for distutils to /usr

    * hash randomization on by default
    * many other new bugfixes and features, check NEWS for details
- pre_checkin.sh now autofills various version strings in specs
- ship hashlib's fallback modules - those uselessly take up space
  when real _hashlib.so from python3 is present, but the space wasted
  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)

  * Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations when Python is embedded
  * The __hash__() methods of ipaddress.IPv4Interface and ipaddress.IPv6Interface 
    incorrectly generated constant hash values of 32 and 128 respectively. This 
    resulted in always causing hash collisions. The fix uses hash() to generate 
    hash values for the tuple of (address, mask length, network address).

    a InvalidURL to be raised.
  - bpo-39503: CVE-2020-8492: The AbstractBasicAuthHandler class
    of the urllib.request module uses an inefficient regular
    expression which can be exploited by an attacker to cause
    a denial of service. Fix the regex to prevent the
    catastrophic backtracking. Vulnerability reported by Ben

- Update to 3.6.10 (still in line with jsc#SLE-9426,
  jsc#SLE-9427, bsc#1159035):
  - Security:
    - bpo-38945: Newline characters have been escaped when
      performing uu encoding to prevent them from overflowing
      into to content section of the encoded file. This prevents
      malicious or accidental modification of data during the
      decoding process.
    - bpo-37228: Due to significant security concerns, the
      reuse_address parameter of
      asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint() is no longer
      supported. This is because of the behavior of SO_REUSEADDR
      in UDP. For more details, see the documentation for
      loop.create_datagram_endpoint(). (Contributed by Kyle
      Stanley, Antoine Pitrou, and Yury Selivanov in bpo-37228.)
    - bpo-38804: Fixes a ReDoS vulnerability in http.cookiejar.
      Patch by Ben Caller.
    - bpo-38243: Escape the server title of
      xmlrpc.server.DocXMLRPCServer when rendering the document
      page as HTML. (Contributed by Dong-hee Na in bpo-38243.)
    - bpo-38174: Update vendorized expat library version to
      2.2.8, which resolves CVE-2019-15903.
    - bpo-37461: Fix an infinite loop when parsing specially
      crafted email headers. Patch by Abhilash Raj.
    - bpo-34155: Fix parsing of invalid email addresses with more
      than one @ (e.g. a@b@c.com.) to not return the part before
      2nd @ as valid email address. Patch by maxking &amp; jpic.
  - Library:
    - bpo-38216: Allow the rare code that wants to send invalid
      http requests from the http.client library a way to do so.
      The fixes for bpo-30458 led to breakage for some projects
      that were relying on this ability to test their own
      behavior in the face of bad requests.
    - bpo-36564: Fix infinite loop in email header folding logic
      that would be triggered when an email policy’s
      max_line_length is not long enough to include the required
      markup and any values in the message. Patch by Paul Ganssle
- Remove patches included in the upstream tarball:
  - CVE-2019-16935-xmlrpc-doc-server_title.patch (and also
    bpo37614-race_test_docxmlrpc_srv_setup.patch, which was
    resolving bsc#1174701).
  - CVE-2019-16056-email-parse-addr.patch
- Move idle subpackage build from python3-base to python3 (bsc#1159622).
  appstream-glib required for packaging introduces considerable
  extra dependencies and a build loop via rust/librsvg.
- Correct installation of idle IDE icons:
  + idle.png is not the target directory
  + non-GNOME-specific icons belong into icons/hicolor
- Add required Name key to idle3 desktop file
- Unify all Python 3.6* SLE packages into one (jsc#SLE-9426,
  jsc#SLE-9427, bsc#1159035)

    - CVE-2018-14647_XML_SetHashSalt-in_elementtree.patch
- Add CVE-2019-16935-xmlrpc-doc-server_title.patch fixing
  bsc#1153238 (aka CVE-2019-16935) fixing a reflected XSS in
  python/Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py
- Add bpo-36576-skip_tests_for_OpenSSL-111.patch (originally from
  bpo#36576) skipping tests failing with OpenSSL 1.1.1. Fixes

- Add bpo36263-Fix_hashlib_scrypt.patch which works around
  bsc#1151490
- Add CVE-2019-16056-email-parse-addr.patch fixing the email
  module wrongly parses email addresses [bsc#1149955,

  test_utime_current_old test.
- FAKE RECORD FROM SLE-12 CHANNEL Apply
  &quot;CVE-2018-1000802-shutil_use_subprocess_no_spawn.patch&quot; which
  converts shutil._call_external_zip to use subprocess rather
  than distutils.spawn. [bsc#1109663, CVE-2018-1000802]
- FAKE RECORD FROM SLE-12 CHANNEL bsc#1109847: add
  CVE-2018-14647_XML_SetHashSalt-in_elementtree.patch fixing bpo#34623.

  correctly validate the domain: it could be tricked into sending
  cookies to the wrong server.
- bsc#1138459: add CVE-2019-10160-netloc-port-regression.patch

- bsc#1130840 (CVE-2019-9947): add CVE-2019-9947-no-ctrl-char-http.patch
  Address the issue by disallowing URL paths with embedded
  whitespace or control characters through into the underlying
  http client request. Such potentially malicious header
  injection URLs now cause a ValueError to be raised.
- bsc#1129346: add CVE-2019-9636-urlsplit-NFKC-norm.patch
  Characters in the netloc attribute that decompose under NFKC
  normalization (as used by the IDNA encoding) into any of ``/``,
  ``?``, ``#``, ``@``, or ``:`` will raise a ValueError. If the
  URL is decomposed before parsing, or is not a Unicode string,
  no error will be raised. (CVE-2019-9636)
  Upstream gh#python/cpython#12224
- bsc#1120644 add CVE-2018-20406-pickle_LONG_BINPUT.patch fixing bpo#34656
  Modules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via
  a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a &quot;resize to twice
  the size&quot; attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is
  only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
  hundreds of gigabytes of data.
- bsc#1122191: add CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch
  fixing bpo-35746.
  An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
  X509 certificate parser of Python.org Python 2.7.11 / 3.7.2.
  A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a NULL pointer
  dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can
  initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates
  to trigger this vulnerability.
- Add -fwrapv to OPTS, which is default for python3 anyway
  See for example https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/issues/86
  for bugs which are caused by avoiding it. (bsc#1107030)
- Apply &quot;CVE-2018-1061-DOS-via-regexp-difflib.patch&quot; to prevent
  low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060) and to prevent difflib REDOS
  (CVE-2018-1061). Prior to this patch mail server's timestamp was
  susceptible to catastrophic backtracking on long evil response from
  the server. Also, it was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking,
  which was a potential DOS vector.

    * many other new bugfixes and features, check NEWS for details
- pre_checkin.sh now autofills various version strings in specs
- ship hashlib's fallback modules - those uselessly take up space
  when real _hashlib.so from python3 is present, but the space wasted
  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)

  make python3-base functional again
- update to python 3.2
    * stable ABI, ABI-tagged .so files
    * concurrent.futures and many other new or upgraded modules
    * PYC repository directories ( __pycache__ )

  python-Sphinx (bsc#1174571) is not necessary anymore.
- Update to 3.6.12 (bsc#1179193)
  * Ensure python3.dll is loaded from correct locations when Python is embedded
  * The __hash__() methods of ipaddress.IPv4Interface and ipaddress.IPv6Interface 
    incorrectly generated constant hash values of 32 and 128 respectively. This 
    resulted in always causing hash collisions. The fix uses hash() to generate 
    hash values for the tuple of (address, mask length, network address).
  * Prevent http header injection by rejecting control characters in 
    http.client.putrequest(…).
  * Unpickling invalid NEWOBJ_EX opcode with the C implementation raises now 
    UnpicklingError instead of crashing.

    potentially malicious header injection URLs now cause
    a InvalidURL to be raised.
  - bpo-39503: CVE-2020-8492: The AbstractBasicAuthHandler class
    of the urllib.request module uses an inefficient regular
    expression which can be exploited by an attacker to cause

- Update to 3.6.10 (still in line with jsc#SLE-9426,
  jsc#SLE-9427, bsc#1159035):
  - Security:
    - bpo-38945: Newline characters have been escaped when
      performing uu encoding to prevent them from overflowing
      into to content section of the encoded file. This prevents
      malicious or accidental modification of data during the
      decoding process.
    - bpo-37228: Due to significant security concerns, the
      reuse_address parameter of
      asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint() is no longer
      supported. This is because of the behavior of SO_REUSEADDR
      in UDP. For more details, see the documentation for
      loop.create_datagram_endpoint(). (Contributed by Kyle
      Stanley, Antoine Pitrou, and Yury Selivanov in bpo-37228.)
    - bpo-38804: Fixes a ReDoS vulnerability in http.cookiejar.
      Patch by Ben Caller.

      than one @ (e.g. a@b@c.com.) to not return the part before
      2nd @ as valid email address. Patch by maxking &amp; jpic.
  - Library:
    - bpo-38216: Allow the rare code that wants to send invalid
      http requests from the http.client library a way to do so.
      The fixes for bpo-30458 led to breakage for some projects
      that were relying on this ability to test their own
      behavior in the face of bad requests.
    - bpo-36564: Fix infinite loop in email header folding logic
      that would be triggered when an email policy’s
      max_line_length is not long enough to include the required
      markup and any values in the message. Patch by Paul Ganssle

  Upstream gh#python/cpython#12224
- bsc#1120644 add CVE-2018-20406-pickle_LONG_BINPUT.patch fixing bpo#34656
  Modules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via
  a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a &quot;resize to twice
  the size&quot; attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is
  only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
  hundreds of gigabytes of data.
- bsc#1122191: add CVE-2019-5010-null-defer-x509-cert-DOS.patch
  fixing bpo-35746.
  An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
  X509 certificate parser of Python.org Python 2.7.11 / 3.7.2.
  A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause a NULL pointer
  dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker can
  initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates
  to trigger this vulnerability.
- Add -fwrapv to OPTS, which is default for python3 anyway
  See for example https://github.com/zopefoundation/persistent/issues/86
  for bugs which are caused by avoiding it. (bsc#1107030)
- Apply &quot;CVE-2018-1061-DOS-via-regexp-difflib.patch&quot; to prevent
  low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060) and to prevent difflib REDOS
  (CVE-2018-1061). Prior to this patch mail server's timestamp was
  susceptible to catastrophic backtracking on long evil response from
  the server. Also, it was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking,
  which was a potential DOS vector.

  see See http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/v3.3.0/Misc/NEWS
- Refresh Python-3.3.0b2-multilib.patch
- Refresh python-3.2b2-buildtime-generate.patch
- Drop upstream patches: ctypes-libffi-aarch64.patch,
  python-3.2.3rc2-pypirc-secure.patch, python-3.3.0-getdents64.patch
- Add Source URL, see https://en.opensuse.org/title=SourceUrls
- remove spurious modification of python-3.3.0b1-localpath.patch
  that would force installation into /usr/local.
  this fixes bnc#809831
- replace broken movetogetdents64.diff patch with a correct one
  from upstream repo (python-3.3.0-getdents64.patch)
- add ctypes-libffi-aarch64.patch:
  * import aarch64 support for libffi in _ctypes module
- add aarch64 to the list of lib64 based archs 
- add movetogetdents64.diff:
  * port to getdents64, as SYS_getdents is not implemented everywhere
- /etc/rpm/macros.python3 is no %config, it is not meant to be changed
  by users.
- Add rpmlintrc with some obvious filters
- update baselibs for new version of libpython3
- fix include path in macros (bnc#787526)
- implement failed import handlers for modules that live in
  subpackages - e.g. &quot;import ssl&quot; will now throw a sensible error
  message telling you to install &quot;python3&quot;
- merge python3-xml into python3
- merge python3-2to3 library into python3-base
  and the 2to3 binary into python3-devel
  (python3-devel is now in conflict with python-2to3, which
  will be dropped)
- enable --with-system-expat for python3, making the xml modules
  (and thus python3) depend on expat
- reconfigure tests to disable network and GUI resources, which
  the upstream apparently thought is a good idea to enable by default.
  this fixes build failures in Factory
- add lzma-devel to build the _lzma module
- moved %dynlib macro definition to common section
- buildrequire timezone for the test suite
- disable more checks for qemu builds as they use syscalls not
  implemented yet
- exclude test_math for SLE 11; math library fails on negative 
  gamma function values close to integers and 0, probably
  due to imprecision in -lm on SLE_11_SP2. 
- buildrequire libbz2-devel explicitly
- remove distutils.cfg (bnc#658604)
  * this changes default prefix for distutils to /usr
  * see ML for details:
http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2012-09/msg00254.html
- Update to final 3.3.0 release
  * See http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/v3.3.0/Misc/NEWS
- Correct dependency for python3-testsuite, 
  python3-tkinter -&gt; python3-tk
- update to 3.3.0 RC1
- update to 3.3.0 beta 1
    * flexible string representation, no longer distinguishing
      between wide and narrow Unicode builds
    * importlib-based import system
    * virtualenv support in core
    * namespace packages
    * explicit Unicode literals for easier porting
    * key-sharing dict implementation reduces memory footprint
      of OO code
    * hash randomization on by default
    * many other new bugfixes and features, check NEWS for details
- pre_checkin.sh now autofills various version strings in specs
- ship hashlib's fallback modules - those uselessly take up space
  when real _hashlib.so from python3 is present, but the space wasted
  is only 114kB and it provides python3-base with a working hashlib
  module.
  (also, this fixes bnc#743787)
- skip test_io on ppc 
- drop test_io ppc patch
- Satisfy source_validator by uncommenting an otherwise unused &quot;Patch&quot;
  line

  * bugfix-only release
  * reports &quot;linux2&quot; as sys.platform regardless of Linux kernel
- added pre_checkin.sh to copy common spec sections to python3.spec
- added PACKAGING-NOTES with some helpful info for packagers
- Use system ffi, included one is broken see 
  http://bugs.python.org/issue11729 and 
  http://bugs.python.org/issue12081
- license.opensuse.org-compatible license headers
- add automake as buildrequire to avoid implicit dependency
- fix ARM build (exclude some test cases which break for us)
- use sysconfig module to get py3_incdir, py3_abiflags,
  py3_soflags, python3_sitelib and python3_sitearch
- update to 3.2.1
    * bugfix-only release, no major changes
- fix build on linux3 platform
- remove upstreamed pybench patch
- install /usr/lib directories in all cases to prevent spurious
  &quot;directory not owned&quot; in dependent packages
- replaced dynamic so version with manual so version, because
  autobuild does not support autogeneration
- generate macros.python3 at compile-time with fixed values
- don't include bogus values in pyconfig.h, as they can break
  third-party packages (bnc#673071)

  non-split to split packages goes smoothly
- fixed RPM macros to use python3 instead of python
- updated to build --with-wide-unicode (for compatibility with
  fedora and our own python 2.x series)
- fix python3-base build failure due to pybench.py crash by
  python-3.2-pybench.patch
- move pyconfig.h from python3-devel to python3-base package to
  make python3-base functional again
- update to python 3.2
    * stable ABI, ABI-tagged .so files
    * concurrent.futures and many other new or upgraded modules
    * PYC repository directories ( __pycache__ )
    * python WSGI 1.0.1
    * Unicode 6.0.0 support
    * a great number of bugfixes and assorted improvements
- update to python 3.2 RC2
- renamed python3-demo to python3-tools, because the demo part
  became much smaller than the tools part
- added rpm macros
- update to python 3.2 beta 2, see NEWS for details
- split off -base package with less dependencies, and a shlib-policy
  compliant libpython3 package
- mostly rewritten the spec file with more detailed comments
- cleaned up lists of patches
