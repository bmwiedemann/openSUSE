  <title>Dispatches messages to one or more outputs</title>
  <description>This module manages a set of Log::Dispatch::* output objects that can be
logged to via a unified interface.

The idea is that you create a Log::Dispatch object and then add various
logging objects to it (such as a file logger or screen logger). Then you
call the 'log' method of the dispatch object, which passes the message to
each of the objects, which in turn decide whether or not to accept the
message and what to do with it.

This makes it possible to call single method and send a message to a log
file, via email, to the screen, and anywhere else, all with very little
code needed on your part, once the dispatching object has been created.</description>
