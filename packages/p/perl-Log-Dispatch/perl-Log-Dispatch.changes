  - Speedups to the internals to avoid re-validating the same sets of parameters
    repeatedly. Based on a PR #54 from Sergey Leschenko.

  - Added a lazy_open option to the File output. This delays opening the file
    until the first time a log message is written to it. Implemented by Slaven
    Rezić. GH #50.

  - When Log::Dispatch::File is asked to chmod a file and that fails, show the
    requested permissions in octal. Patch by Carsten Grohmann. GitHub #46.
  
  
  2.64     2017-02-25 (TRIAL RELEASE)
  
  - Improve level validation and canonicalization logic. Patch by Kerin Millar,
    minor changes and tests by Kivanc Yazan. Github #42.
  
  - The log_and_die and log_and_croak methods are now identical, as we set
    @CARP_NOT for Log::Dispatch to exclude the Log::Dispatch package. You can
    still explicitly pass carp_level to log_and_croak.

  2.63     2017-02-19
  
   - Updated the conflicting version for Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped in
     metadata (due to changes in handling of close_after_write). Patch by Karen
     Etheridge. GitHub #41.
  
  
  2.62     2017-02-13
  
  - Devel::Confess was accidentally being loaded in Log::Dispatch. Fixed by
    Karen Etheridge. GitHub #39.
  
  
  2.61     2017-02-13
  
  - The 2.60 release would throw an exception if the logged message was
    empty. While this makes sense, it also breaks backwards compatibility, so it
    has been reverted. Reported by Greg Oschwald. GitHub #38.
  
  - The 2.60 release would throw an exception if you tried to create a Syslog
    output where the ident was an empty string. Reported by Greg
    Oschwald. GitHub #38.
  
  
  2.60     2017-02-12
  
  - Same as 2.59 ... Switched from Params::Validate to
    Params::ValidationCompiler. This should speed up constructors and logging a
    little bit. This also allows Log::Dispatch::File to accept things like
    Path::Tiny objects for filenames. Reported by Joel Berger. GitHub #36.

  2.55     2016-05-06
  
  - The values of $@, $!, and $? are protected in various cases where they could
    end up being changed by logging code. Patch by Salvador Fandiño. GitHub #18.
  
  - Treat MSYS2 like Cygwin in tests. Fix by Graham Ollis. GitHub #19.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Log-Dispatch/Changes

  2.54     2016-01-18
  
  - Fixed File::Locked even more. While some deadlocks were eliminated, there
    was still an issue when a Log::Dispatch object was created in a parent
    process and then recreated in the children. If the close_after_write
    parameter was false, then there would be a deadlock.
  
  - Made Syslog work on a threaded Perl when the threads module was not
    explicitly loaded. Fixed by Konrad Bucheli. GitHub #13.
  
  - The log() method now accepts a level parameter as an integer. Fixed by Steve
    Bertrand. GitHub #15.
  
  
  2.53     2016-01-14
  
  - Actually fix File::Locked, this time with some actual tests.
  
  
  2.52     2016-01-13
  
  - Make File::Locked output do an explicit unlock if the close_after_write
    option is not set. Without this it would open the file once in each process,
    attempting to get a lock at open time, pretty much guaranteeing a deadlock
    in a multiprocess environment. Now it should work sanely whether
    close_after_write is true or not.

   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Log-Dispatch/Changes

  2.50     2015-09-02
  
  - Changed how the Screen output handles UTF-8 data once more. The Screen
    module has gone back to printing output directly to the global STDOUT and
    STDERR handles. The previous changes broke the tests for several modules,
    including Log::Dispatch::Config. This change should fix them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 2.49
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Log-Dispatch/Changes

  2.49     2015-08-21
  
  - The Screen output now enables autoflush on the handle it uses to send output
    to STDOUT or STDERR every time it sends a message. This does not affect the
    global STDOUT or STDERR, as the Screen module makes its own handle for
    output. This fixes a bug reported by Karen Etheridge that caused this module
    to not play nicely with Capture::Tiny in some cases. RT #106605.

- updated to 2.48

  2.48     2015-08-07
  
  - Fixed (I hope) tests that were added in the last release that fail on
    Windows.
  
  
  2.47     2015-08-06
  
  - Really, really make per-thread locking work. Depending on when threads and
    threads::shared were loaded, you might get an error like 'Type of arg 1 to
    threads::shared::share must be one of $@% at .../Log/Dispatch/Syslog.pm line
    67, near "$thread_lock)"'. Reported by David Schweikert.
  
  - Added support for auth-related parameters and replyto to
    Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSender. Implemented by Rohan Carly. Based on
    GitHub #10.
  
  - Added a utf8 flag for Log::Dispatch::Screen. If this is true, then it sets
    the ":encoding(UTF-8)" flag on the handle it uses for output (without
    affecting STDOUT or STDERR elsewhere). Suggested by Ivan Baidakou.
  
  
  2.46     2015-08-05
  
  - Really make the per-thread locking in the Syslog output work. Based on a
    patch by David Schweikert. GitHub #9.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- updated to 2.45
   see /usr/share/doc/packages/perl-Log-Dispatch/Changes

  2.45     2015-06-14
  
  - Don't include threads and threads::shared in list of dependencies. This is
    only needed for Log::Dispatch::Syslog and is loaded at runtime as needed
    (which has its own issues but ...). Reported by Kent Fredric. RT #103392.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 21 21:16:26 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.44
  * The fix for a buffered email output in the last release 
    introduced a bug with _non-buffered_ email outputs. This would 
    cause a fatal error during global destruction when the DESTROY 
    method was called. Reported by Chrison Hutchinson. RT #99474.
- Changes for 2.43
  * Fixed the thread locking in Log::Dispatch::Syslog (I hope). 
    The previous version caused Perl to crash when per-thread 
    locking was enabled. Note that I don't use threads so I haven't 
    tested this. Patch by Sergio Fernández Muñoz. RT # 99208.
  * If a buffered email output is being destroyed during global 
    destruction and still has messages in the buffer, we warn and 
    do not attempt to send the messages. During global destruction, 
    the package we use to send email may already be destroyed, 
    leading to weird errors when we try to use it. Reported by 
    Mark Overmeer. RT #97733.
  * In 2.42 I added the ability to pass a hashref for the socket 
    parameter given to Log::Dispatch::Syslog, but I forgot to 
    mention this here. This is necessary to support remote logging. 
    Patch by David Coppit. RT #93045.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- really remove Log-Dispatch-old_Test-More.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 19 12:15:47 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.42
 - Added a Log::Dispatch->clone() method. This returns shallow clone. The
   outputs and callbacks are shared, but changes to outputs and callbacks in
   the clone do not affect the original, or vice versa.
 
 - Added Log::Dispatch->outputs() method. This returns all the output objects
   in a dispatch object.
 
 - Added Log::Dispatch->callbacks() method. This returns all the callback subs
   in a dispatch object.
 
 - The Syslog output now calls Sys::Syslog::setlogsock() every time a message
   is logged, since something else could have called it in between logging two
   messages.
 
 - Added a lock parameter to the Syslog output. If this is true, then logging
   is done in the scope of a per-thread lock. Reported by Cedric Carree and
   Franck Youssef. RT #67988 and #85013.
 
 - Replaced Class::Load with Module::Runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 26 10:01:24 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.41
 - An error is now thrown if you call Log::Dispatch->log without a
   level. Previously you'd just get a warning and then execution would continue
   (without logging anything). Patch by Ross Attrill. RT #87133.
 
 - Added a conflict entry for older Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped to the
   metadata. Patch by Karen Etheridge. RT #86215.
- remove outdated Log-Dispatch-old_Test-More.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 11:46:40 UTC 2013 - coolo@suse.com

- updated to 2.39
 - You can now pass a port option to the MailSender output. Patch by Whitney
   Jackson.
 - Fix test that used undeclared prereqs so it does not do that.
 - Moved Log::Dispatch::File constructor parameter validation moved to
   _basic_init() to facilitate proper subclassing. Patch by ether. RT #84545.
 - Added a very simple Log::Dispatch::Code output. This lets you log to a
   subroutine reference.
 - Added Sys::Syslog 0.25 as a prereq. This is a temporary fix to the problem
   of Log::Dispatch shipping lots of output modules with undeclared prereqs (so
   as not to require mod_perl, four email sending modules, etc.). In the future
   Log::Dispatch will be split into a core distro and a set of distros, one for
   each output that has prereqs. Reported by Michael Schwern. RT #84481.
 - Added a big warning about the potential for deadlocks in the documentation
   for Log::Dispatch::File::Locked. Patch by ether.
 - Fix a test bug that caused the tests to fail on all Perls before 5.16.0.
 - Added a 'syswrite' option to Log::Dispatch::File which causes all writes to
   use syswrite (so they're atomic). Patched by ether. RT #81669.
 - The File output's DESTROY method now checks to see if it's associated handle
   is open before trying to close it. Patch by Jeffrey Thalhammer.

- update to 2.26
  - Doc updates. The 2.23 constructor API was still shown in all the output
    subclasses. Fixed by Jon Swartz.
- 2.25 Sep 15, 2009
  - Added a workaround for a weird tainting issue with Params::Validate. This
    caused a taint exception when a Log::Dispatch::Syslog was created under
    taint mode. Note that there is still a problem in Params::Validate itself,
    this is just a hack.
- 2.24 Sep 13, 2009
  - Simplified new constructor API (the 2.23 API is still silently supported but
    not documented):
      Log::Dispatch->new( outputs => [ [ 'File', ... ],
                                       [ 'Screen', ... ],
                                     ]
                        );
    Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - All of the mail sending modules now warn unconditionally if sending mail
    fails. This removes the incorrect use of warnings::enabled() in some
    modules. RT #43516.
- 2.23 Sep 12, 2009
  - New constructor API that simplifies creating your Log::Dispatch object.
    Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - Made name parameter optional. We now auto-generate a unique name if one is
    not given. Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - Added a newline parameter that causes a newline to be added to each message,
    and updated the documentation regarding newlines. Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - Removed repetitive boilerplate documentation from each output
    class. Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - The level_names and level_numbers used internally are now computed once and
    shared between output objects. Implemented by Jon Swartz.
  - Updated repo url - now at http://hg.urth.org/hg/Log-Dispatch
  - Explicitly depend on Sys::Syslog 0.16.
  - Added warn as a synonym for warning. RT #44821. Requested by Dylan Martin.
  - Added an add_callback method to Log::Dispatch and
    Log::Dispatch::Output. This lets you add a new formatting callback after an
    object is created. Based on a patch from Ricardo Signes. RT #48283.
  - The Log::Dispatch docs mistakenly told you to provide a log() method when
    creating a new output class. RT #40561.
  - Made all modules have the same version as Log::Dispatch itself.
- 2.22 Nov 11, 2008
  - Fixed a bug where Log::Dispatch::Email would die when it tried to
    log under taint mode. Patch by Neil Hemingway. RT #40042.
  - Fixed a misuse of warnings::enabled(). Reported by Darian
    Patrick. RT #39784.
  - Syslog logging now requires Sys::Syslog 0.16+.
  - If you don't pass a socket argument to Log::Dispatch::Syslog, it
    does not call Sys::Syslog::setlogsock(), which is the preferred
    option for portability.
  * If any of the syslog calls die, this is trapped and the error is
    output as a warning if warnings are on. This is mostly a workaround
    for Sys::Sylog not handling utf-8. RT #35270 & #37397.

    This isn't backwards-compatible, but it's probably wrong for the
    logging code to die because it can't log (even though some other
    output modules still do).
- cleanup spec
  * define cpan_name
  * sorted tags
  * fix build-/deps
  * update desc
  * added Changes LICENSE SIGNATURE to doc
  * moved changelog to .changes
- added perl-macros
  * perl_gen_filelist

 - Added log_and_die() and log_and_croak() methods. Patch by Yuval
   Kogman.


- 2.20 Nov 2, 2007

   the report.


- 2.19 Nov 1, 2007

 - Switched to providing a traditional Makefile.PL as well as a
   Build.PL file. RT #27208.

 - When permissions are specified for a Log::Dispatch::File object,
   don't try to chmod the file unless the permissions of the file
   differ from what the file already has. Based on a patch by Kevin. RT
   #28151.

 - Require at least Perl 5.6.0.

 - Remove the tests for the email sending and exit codes, since the
   test had a heisenbug I could not understand. I _think_ the code in
   the email modules is correct, but the test isn't proving anything.

 - Added a binmode parameter for Log::Dispatch::File. Based on a patch
