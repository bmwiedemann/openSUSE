  <title>Framework for object oriented programming in Perl.</title>
  <description>&quot;Spiffy&quot; is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It
attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a
clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way. Spiffy
borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby, Java and Perl
6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.</description>
