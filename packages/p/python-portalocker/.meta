  <description>Portalocker is a library to provide an easy API to file locking.

An important detail to note is that on Linux and Unix systems the locks are
advisory by default. By specifying the `-o mand` option to the mount command it
is possible to enable mandatory file locking on Linux. This is generally not
recommended however.</description>
