<package name="perl-XML-XPath" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>A set of modules for parsing and evaluating XPath statements</title>
  <description>This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow extensions to be added in the
form of functions. Modules such as XSLT and XPointer may need to do
this as they support functionality beyond XPath.</description>
