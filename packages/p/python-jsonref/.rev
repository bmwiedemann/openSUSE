    <comment>- update to 1.1.0:
  * Fixes documents where the root is a reference object not
    being cached
  * Allows a reference object to refer to a fragment within
    itself. fix #51,Â #40
  * Extra properties of a reference object will now have
    references resolved.
- update to 1.0.1:
  * Fix issue with proxies=False where it would not recurse
    through references to remove the proxies. #48
- update to 1.0.0:
  * `replace_refs` is now a function rather than a class method
    of `JsonRef` (The class method is still around, but
    deprecated.)
  * New options were also added to `replace_refs`
  * `jsonloader` is now a plan function rather than an instance
    of a class. (This is a breaking change if you were
    subclassing `JsonLoader`)
- add patch use-pdm-backend.patch: switch to more modern
  pdm-backend

- Update to version 0.2 (python 3.7 support)
- Packaging :
  + spec-cleaner
  + Add tests</comment>
