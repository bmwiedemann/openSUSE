  <title>Uniform Resource Identifiers (absolute and relative)</title>
  <description>This module implements the URI class. Objects of this class represent
&quot;Uniform Resource Identifier references&quot; as specified in RFC 2396 (and
updated by RFC 2732).

URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
combine URIs in various ways.</description>
