%description
Please see the Alien manpage for the manifesto of the Alien namespace.

In short 'Alien::SDL' can be used to detect and get configuration settings
from an installed SDL and related libraries. Based on your platform it
offers the possibility to download and install prebuilt binaries or to
build SDL & co. from source codes.

The important facts:

* * The module does not modify in any way the already existing SDL
  installation on your system.

* * If you reinstall SDL libs on your system you do not need to
  reinstall Alien::SDL (providing that you use the same directory for
  the new installation).

* * The prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources are always
  installed into perl module's 'share' directory.

* * If you use prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources
  it happens that some of the dynamic libraries (*.so, *.dll) will not
  automaticly loadable as they will be stored somewhere under perl module's
  'share' directory. To handle this scenario Alien::SDL offers some special
  functionality (see below).
