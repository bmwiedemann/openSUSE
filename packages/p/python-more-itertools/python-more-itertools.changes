      + ``collate`` now delegates to ``heapq.merge`` when possible.
        (Thanks to kmike and julianpistorius)
      + ``peekable``-wrapped iterables are now indexable and
        sliceable. Iterating through ``peekable``-wrapped iterables
        is also faster.
      + ``one`` and ``unique_to_each`` have been simplified.
        (Thanks to coady)
  2.3:
