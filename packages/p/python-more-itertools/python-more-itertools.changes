  * New itertools:

        (thanks to MSeifert04 and pylang)
      + :func:`islice_extended`
  * Improvements to existing itertools:
      + Some bugs with slicing :func:`peekable`-wrapped iterables
        were fixed
  3.1.0:
  * New itertools:
      + :func:`numeric_range` (Thanks to BebeSparkelSparkel and
        MSeifert04)
      + :func:`count_cycle` (Thanks to BebeSparkelSparkel)
      + :func:`locate` (Thanks to pylang and MSeifert04)
  * Improvements to existing itertools:
      + A few itertools are now slightly faster due to some
        function optimizations. (Thanks to MSeifert04)
  * The docs have been substantially revised with installation
    notes, categories for library functions, links, and more.
    (Thanks to pylang)
  3.0.0:
  * Removed itertools:

        keyword arguments. (Thanks to yardsale8)
  * PyPy and PyPy3 are now supported.
    The major version change is due to the removal of the
    ``context`` function.

    Replace it with standard ``with`` statement context management:
    .. code-block:: python

      # Don't use context() anymore
      file_obj = StringIO()
      consume(print(x, file=f) for f in context(file_obj) for x in
      u'123')

      # Use a with statement instead
      file_obj = StringIO()
      with file_obj as f:
          consume(print(x, file=f) for x in u'123')
  2.6.0:
  * New itertools:
      + ``adjacent`` and ``groupby_transform`` (Thanks to diazona)

      + ``distribute`` (Thanks to mozbhearsum and coady)

  * Improvements to existing itertools:
      + ``peekable`` now handles negative indexes and slices with
        negative components properly.
      + ``intersperse`` is now slightly faster. (Thanks to pylang)
      + ``windowed`` now accepts a ``step`` keyword argument.
        (Thanks to pylang)
  * Python 3.6 is now supported.
  2.4.1:
  * Move docs 100% to readthedocs.io.
  2.4:
  * New itertools:
      + ``accumulate``, ``all_equal``, ``first_true``,
        ``partition``, and
        ``tail`` from the itertools documentation.
      + ``bucket`` (Thanks to Rosuav and cvrebert)

        astronouth7303)
      + ``spy`` (Thanks to themiurgo and mathieulongtin)

      + ``chunked`` is now simpler and more friendly to garbage
        collection.
        (Contributed by coady, with thanks to piskvorky)
      + ``collate`` now delegates to ``heapq.merge`` when possible.
        (Thanks to kmike and julianpistorius)
      + ``peekable``-wrapped iterables are now indexable and
        sliceable. Iterating through ``peekable``-wrapped iterables
        is also faster.
      + ``one`` and ``unique_to_each`` have been simplified.
        (Thanks to coady)
  2.3:
  * Added ``one`` from ``jaraco.util.itertools``. (Thanks, jaraco!)
