      + Some bugs with slicing :func:`peekable`-wrapped iterables
        were fixed

  * New itertools:
      + :func:`numeric_range` (Thanks to BebeSparkelSparkel and
        MSeifert04)
      + :func:`count_cycle` (Thanks to BebeSparkelSparkel)
      + :func:`locate` (Thanks to pylang and MSeifert04)
  * Improvements to existing itertools:
      + A few itertools are now slightly faster due to some
        function optimizations. (Thanks to MSeifert04)
  * The docs have been substantially revised with installation
    notes, categories for library functions, links, and more.

    The major version change is due to the removal of the
    ``context`` function.

    Replace it with standard ``with`` statement context management:
    .. code-block:: python

      # Don't use context() anymore
      file_obj = StringIO()
      consume(print(x, file=f) for f in context(file_obj) for x in
      u'123')

      # Use a with statement instead
      file_obj = StringIO()
      with file_obj as f:
          consume(print(x, file=f) for x in u'123')
  2.6.0:
  * New itertools:

        (Thanks to pylang)

  2.4.1:
  * Move docs 100% to readthedocs.io.
  2.4:

      + ``accumulate``, ``all_equal``, ``first_true``,

      + ``collate`` now delegates to ``heapq.merge`` when possible.
        (Thanks to kmike and julianpistorius)
      + ``peekable``-wrapped iterables are now indexable and
        sliceable. Iterating through ``peekable``-wrapped iterables
        is also faster.
      + ``one`` and ``unique_to_each`` have been simplified.
        (Thanks to coady)
  2.3:
  * Added ``one`` from ``jaraco.util.itertools``. (Thanks, jaraco!)
