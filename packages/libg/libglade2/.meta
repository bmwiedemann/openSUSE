  <title>Glade Library Compatible with the GNOME 2.x Desktop Platform</title>
  <description>This library allows you to load Glade interface files in a program at
runtime. It does not require that you use Glade, but Glade is the
easiest way to create the interface files.  For an idea of how to use
the library, see the documentation, especially
/usr/share/doc/packages/libglade/test-libgladee.c and the glade-xml.h
include, which is in the libglade package.</description>
