- build version 0.7.2
  + Fixed bug #2019450 (added a workaround for open source drivers of the Intel chipsets : a bug in the drivers prevent a character to be displayed).
  + Fixed a bug which caused some memory leaks when memory allocation failed during the update of the masters.
  + Updated the demo in the examples: extrusion and ligthing have been added.
  + Fixed glcGetFontMap() and glcGetMasterMap() so that their return is not null when a character is mapped in the font/master but its Unicode name is not stored in QuesoGLC database.
  + Character codes out of range are now rejected when GLC_UCS1 or GLC_UCS2 are enabled. GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR is then raised.
  + Fixed a bug that crashed QuesoGLC when trying to call glcGetFontMap() with a character not mapped in the font.
  + Fixed a bug which caused the measurement caches not to be updated when GLC_RESOLUTION was changed by the users.
  + Fixed a memory leak in the management of the texture atlas: when a font was deleted, the memory allocated to this font in the atlas was definitely lost instead of being given back to the texture allocator.
  + Fixed a bug which did not include trailing spaces in the calculation of bounding boxes.
  + Fixed a bug which caused artifacts when rendering glyphes that extend beyond the EM square.
  + Fixed a bug which prevented letters l and i to be displayed at small scales when GLC_HINTING_QSO and GLC_TEXTURE were enabled.
  + Side effect of the above bug fix : the antialiasing is improved for most characters since they are no longer located against the edges of the texture.
  + Fixed a bug in glcGenFontID() which could return the ID of an existing font.
  + Fixed a race condition in glcGenContext()
  + Function glcGetStringCharMetric() now returns metrics in global string coordinates (otherwise the kerning can not be measured)
  + Fixed bug #1987563 (Kerning does not work when GLC_GL_OBJECTS is enabled) Thanks to GenPFault for the bug report.
  + Fixed bug #2012579 (Mac OSX Leopard compiling bug) - Thanks to Michael Strobel and Tim Baumgartner for the bug report and the patch.
  + Negative values passed to glcResolution() now raise GLC_PARAMETER_ERROR
  + Fixed bug #1980982 (Checks for MinGW in the configure script are incomplete)
  + Feature request #1947346 : added files for pkg-config (thanks to Giel van Shijndel and Dennis Schridde for providing them)
  + Fixed bug #1947464 (Warnings are generated when compiling with gcc option -Wstrict-prototypes)
  + Fixed bug #1935557 (Fonts are not rendered correctly when the resolution is changed using glcResolution).
