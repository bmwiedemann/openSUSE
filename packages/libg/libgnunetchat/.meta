  <title>Library for applications to utilize the Messenger service of GNUnet</title>
  <description>This library is an abstraction layer using the client API from different GNUnet
services to provide the functionality of a typical messenger application. The
goal is to make developing such applications easier and independent of the GUI
toolkit. So people can develop different interfaces being compatible with
eachother despite visual differences, a few missing features or differences in
overall design.
