Fri Apr 17 13:54:32 UTC 2020 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Update to v1.5.1:
  * Bug fixes:
    - relax gpiod_chip_open() for symbolic links
- Update to v1.5:
  * New features:
    - switched to using the GLib testing framework for core library tests and BATS
      (Bash Automated Testing System) for command-line tools
    - used Catch2 C++ testing framework to implement a proper test-suite for C++
      bindings while also reusing the API provided by libgpiomockup
    - used Python's unittest package to implement a proper test suite for Python
      bindings and reused libgpiockup again
    - provided line::update() and Line.update() routines for C++ and Python
      bindings respectively allowing to update the line info from bindings as well
    - added support for bias flags which are a new functionality first available in
      linux v5.5; subsequently the library now requires v5.5 kernel headers to
      build; the new flags are supported in the core library, C++ and Python
      bindings as well as the command-line tools
    - added support for the new SET_CONFIG ioctl(): this too is a new functionality
      added in linux v5.5; both features have been implemented in the library by
      Kent Gibson
    - added routines for reading multiple line events at once to the core library,
      C++ and Python bindings
  * Improvements:
    - constified function arguments where applicable in libgpiomockup
    - fixed the name of the test exeucutable displayed at build time
    - improved the function pointer casting in Python bindings to avoid warnings
      emitted by GCC8
    - switched to using the KERNEL_VERSION() macro in tests instead of handcoded
      version parsing
    - improved the setup ordering in tests (setup libgpiomockup before checking
      the kernel version
    - add 'extern "c"' to the libgpiomockup header to make it usable from C++
    - add chip index validation to libgpiomockup functions
    - check if the debugfs directory used by libgpiomockup is writable before
      using it to set the pull of dummy lines
    - add several new test cases
    - improved Python example programs (made gpiomon's output similar to the
      original tool, make gpioset wait for an ENTER pres by default)
    - fixed the major:minor number comparison between the device and sysfs
    - deprecated the gpiod_line_needs_update() function and removed the logic
      behind it from the library
    - shrank the Python bindings a bit by directly returning the value from
      PyErr_SetFromErrno()
    - dropped noexcept from methods which can throw in C++ bindings
    - switched to initializing the bitset with integers instead of strings in C++
      bindings
    - allowed gpiod_line_set_value_bulk() to accept null pointers
    - when building Python bindings: check for the existence of python-config
    - improved the readability of help text messages for command-line tools
    - reworked the .gitignore file: added libtool scripts generated during
      cross-compilation and split the main .gitignore into several fine-grained
      files
    - fixed several misspellings
    - other minor tweaks and improvements
  * Bug fixes:
    - fixed memory leaks in libgpiomockup
    - fixed memory leaks in the testing framework
    - fixed a segfault in error path in tests
    - make gpioinfo show lines claimed by the kernel as used even if they have no
      named consumer
    - fixed the test cases validating the '--active-low' switch in gpiomon and
      the GPIOHANDLE_REQUEST_ACTIVE_LOW flag in the core library after a fix
      for incorrect behavior was merged in linux v5.2.7
    - stopped failing at init-time of libgpiomockup if gpio-mockup is already
      loaded
    - added a missing throw keyword in error path in C++ bindings
    - fixed a segfault in Python bindings when calling Line.request() without
      the consumer argument

  * fix a bug in gpioinfo where lines used by the kernel without any consumer
    string were reported as unused
  * fix a bug in line::event_get_fd() in C++ bindings where the exception
    wouldn't be throws in error cases due to a missing 'throw' keyword
  * fix a couple bugs in the test-suite
  * disable a failing assertion in the test-suite that stopped working after
  linux v5.2.7

Thu Jun 13 10:49:43 UTC 2019 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Update to 1.4:
  * New features:
    - updated the testing framework to work with linux v5.1 in which the debugfs
      interface of the GPIO testing module changed in a backward incompatible way
    - factored out the code controlling the GPIO testing module into a separate
      shared library that may be reused by future testing executables for different
      language bindings
    - removed the --enable-install-tests build option and the make check target as
      they were redundant, subsequently tests are now installed as a normal program
      whenever they're enabled with --enable-tests

  * Improvements:
    - removed unnecessary std::move calls from C++ bindings
    - added the explicit keyword to bool() operators in C++ bindings

  * Bug fixes:

  * New features:
    - the gpio-tools now have automatically generated (using help2man) man pages
      that are bundled with the release tarball
    - support a singular 'default_val' argument in Line.request() in python
      bindings
    - the test executable can now be installed to the bindir along with the
      gpio-tools and the testing framework will look for the binaries in standard
      locations if it's not run from the top source directory
    - gpiomon now supports line buffered output

  * Improvements:
    - tweaks to the C API documentation
    - treewide unification of the naming of local variables
    - extended helptest in gpioset (explanation of the way the character device
      works aimed at reducing user confusion when a GPIO line reverts to its
      default value after gpioset exits)
    - the source directories have been rearranged and the src/ directory was
      dropped, lib/ and tools/ now live in the top source directory

    - ignore 'remove' events from udev in the testing framework
    - don't segfault on num_lines = 0 in ctxless functions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
