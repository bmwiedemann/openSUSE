- update to 1.1.0:
  * The refs/remotes/origin/HEAD file will be created at clone
    time to point to the origin's default branch
  * libgit2 now uses the __atomic_ intrinsics instead of __sync_

  * The init.defaultBranch setting is now respected and master is
    no longer the hardcoded as the default branch name
  * Patch files that do not contain an index line can now be parsed
  * Configuration files with multi-line values can now contain
    quotes split across multiple lines
  * Servers that request an upgrade to a newer HTTP version are

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 17:12:03 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  * CMake was converted to make use of the GNUInstallDirs module
    for both our pkgconfig and install targets in favor of our
    custom build options BIN_INSTALL_DIR, LIB_INSTALL_DIR and
    INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR. Instead, you can now use CMakes standard
    variables CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR, CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR and
    CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR.
  * Some CMake build options accepted either a specific value or a
    boolean value to disable the option altogether or use automatic
    detection. We only accepted "ON" or "OFF", but none of the
    other values CMake recognizes as boolean. This was aligned with
    CMake's understanding of booleans.
  * The installed pkgconfig file contained incorrect values for
    both libdir and includedir variables.
  * If using pcre2 for regular expressions, then we incorrectly
    added "pcre2" instead of "pcre2-8" to our pkgconfig
    dependencies, which was corrected.
  * Fixed building the bundled ntlmclient dependency on FreeBSD,
    OpenBSD and SunOS.
  * When writing symlinks on Windows, we incorrectly handled
    relative symlink targets, which was corrected.
  * When using the HTTP protocol via macOS' SecureTransport
    implementation, reads could stall at the end of the session and
    only continue after a timeout of 60 seconds was reached.
  * The filesystem-based reference callback didn't corectly
    initialize the backend version.
  * A segmentation fault was fixed when calling git_blame_buffer()
    for files that were modified and added to the index.
  * A backwards-incompatible change was introduced when we moved
    some structures from "git2/credentials.h" into
    "git2/sys/credentials.h". This was fixed in the case where you
    do not use hard deprecation.
  * Improved error handling in various places.
- Change sover define to 1_0 and in baselibs following upstream
  changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  1 16:59:38 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.28.5:
  * Fix an out-of-bounds read when applying patches that do not end
    with a newline.
  * Fix an out-of-bounds read when decoding specially crafted
    binary patches.
  * Fix an out-of-bounds read when receiving a specially crafted
    "OK" packet via the smarthttp transport.
  * Fix lifetime for parsed patches depending on the lifetime of
    the parsed buffe.
  * Several fixes when parsing and applying patches.
  * Fix computed patch IDs for patches that have no newline at end
    of file.
  * Fix applying patches to trees that add new files.
  * Do not read configuration from a user's home directory if
    running in a sandboxed environment.
  * Fix handling of nested ignore rules overriding wildcard
    unignores in parent directories.
  * Fix reference locks not being correctly honored on Unix
    systems.
  * Follow 308 redirects when fetching or pushing from remote
    repositories on Windows.
  * Fix a race when detaching the libgit2 library on Windows.
  * Update the "binary" gitattribute macro to match git's change
    to "-diff -merge -text -crlf".
  * Refuse to delete the HEAD reference.
  * Fixes for several memory leaks.
  * When fetching from an anonymous remote using a URL with
    authentication information provided in the URL (eg
    https://foo:bar@example.com/repo), we would erroneously include
    the literal URL in the FETCH_HEAD file. We now remove that to
    match git's behavior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 15:58:48 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- libgit2 0.28.4:
  * CVE-2019-1348: the fast-import stream command "feature
    export-marks=path" allows writing to arbitrary file paths. As
    libgit2 does not offer any interface for fast-import, it is not
    susceptible to this vulnerability. (boo#1158785)
  * CVE-2019-1349: by using NTFS 8.3 short names, backslashes or
    alternate filesystreams, it is possible to cause submodules to
    be written into pre-existing directories during a recursive
    clone using git. As libgit2 rejects cloning into non-empty
    directories by default, it is not susceptible to this
    vulnerability. (boo#1158787)
  * CVE-2019-1350: recursive clones may lead to arbitrary remote
    code executing due to improper quoting of command line
    arguments. As libgit2 uses libssh2, which does not require us
    to perform command line parsing, it is not susceptible to this
    vulnerability. (boo#1158788)
  * CVE-2019-1351: Windows provides the ability to substitute
    drive letters with arbitrary letters, including multi-byte
    Unicode letters. To fix any potential issues arising from
    interpreting such paths as relative paths, we have extended
    detection of DOS drive prefixes to accomodate for such cases.
    (boo#1158790)
  * CVE-2019-1352: by using NTFS-style alternative file streams for
    the ".git" directory, it is possible to overwrite parts of the
    repository. While this has been fixed in the past for Windows,
    the same vulnerability may also exist on other systems that
    write to NTFS filesystems. We now reject any paths starting
    with ".git:" on all systems. (boo#1158790)
  * CVE-2019-1353: by using NTFS-style 8.3 short names, it was
    possible to write to the ".git" directory and thus overwrite
    parts of the repository, leading to possible remote code
    execution. While this problem was already fixed in the past for
    Windows, other systems accessing NTFS filesystems are
    vulnerable to this issue too. We now enable NTFS protecions by
    default on all systems to fix this attack vector. (boo#1158791)
  * CVE-2019-1354: on Windows, backslashes are not a valid part of
    a filename but are instead interpreted as directory separators.
    As other platforms allowed to use such paths, it was possible
    to write such invalid entries into a Git repository and was
    thus an attack vector to write into the ".git" dierctory. We
    now reject any entries starting with ".git" on all systems.
    (boo#1158792)
  * CVE-2019-1387: it is possible to let a submodule's git
    directory point into a sibling's submodule directory, which may
    result in overwriting parts of the Git repository and thus lead
    to arbitrary command execution. As libgit2 doesn't provide any
    way to do submodule clones natively, it is not susceptible to
    this vulnerability. Users of libgit2 that have implemented
    recursive submodule clones manually are encouraged to review
    their implementation for this vulnerability. (boo#1158793)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 13:30:43 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- libgit2 0.28.3:
  * A carefully constructed commit object with a very large number
    of parents may have lead to out-of-bounds writes or potential
    denial of service (boo#1158981)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 23 08:42:15 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.28.2:
  * Fix include directory ordering when using bundled dependencies.
  * Fix infinite loop when searching for a non-existing repository with
    Windows-style paths including drive prefixes.
  * Fix symlinks to directories on Windows.
  * Fix paths with a trailing "/" not always being treated as
    directories when computing ignores.
  * Fix false negatives when computing ignores where ignore rules
    that are a prefix to a negative ignore rule exist.
  * Fix patches with CRLF line endings not being parsed correctly.
  * Fix segfault when parsing patches with file addition (deletion)
    where the added (deleted) file name contains a space.
  * Fix assertion failure when trying to write to a non-existent
    locked configuration file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 14 19:09:18 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

-  Update to version 0.28.1:
   - The deprecated functions (git_buf_free and the giterr_ family
     of functions) are now exported properly. In the v0.28 release,
     they were not given the correct external attributes and they
     did not have the correct linkage visibility in the v0.28
     library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 10:20:24 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.28.0:
  * Changes or improvements:
    - The library is now always built with cdecl calling
      conventions on Windows; the ability to build a stdcall
      library has been removed.
    - Reference log creation now honors
      core.logallrefupdates=always.
    - Fix some issues with the error-reporting in the OpenSSL
      backend.
    - HTTP proxy support is now builtin; libcurl is no longer used
      to support proxies and is removed as a dependency.
    - Certificate and credential callbacks can now return
      GIT_PASSTHROUGH to decline to act; libgit2 will behave as if
      there was no callback set in the first place.
    - The line-ending filtering logic - when checking out files -
      has been updated to match newer git (>= git 2.9) for proper
      interoperability.
    - Symbolic links are now supported on Windows when
      core.symlinks is set to true.
    - Submodules with names which attempt to perform path traversal
      now have their configuration ignored. Such names were blindly
      appended to the $GIT_DIR/modules and a malicious name could
      lead to an attacker writing to an arbitrary location. This
      matches git's handling of CVE-2018-11235.
    - Object validation is now performed during tree creation in
      the git_index_write_tree_to API.
    - Configuration variable may now be specified on the same line
      as a section header; previously this was erroneously a parser
      error.
    - When an HTTP server supports both NTLM and Negotiate
      authentication mechanisms, we would previously fail to
      authenticate with any mechanism.
    - The GIT_OPT_SET_PACK_MAX_OBJECTS option can now set the
      maximum number of objects allowed in a packfile being
      downloaded; this can help limit the maximum memory used when
      fetching from an untrusted remote.
    - Line numbers in diffs loaded from patch files were not being
      populated; they are now included in the results.
    - The repository's index is reloaded from disk at the beginning
      of git_merge operations to ensure that it is up-to-date.
    - Mailmap handling APIs have been introduced, and the new
      commit APIs git_commit_committer_with_mailmap and
      git_commit_author_with_mailmap will use the mailmap to
      resolve the committer and author information. In addition,
      blame will use the mailmap given when the
      GIT_BLAME_USE_MAILMAP option.
    - Ignore handling for files in ignored folders would be
      ignored.
    - Worktrees can now be backed by bare repositories.
    - Trailing spaces are supported in .gitignore files, these
      spaces were previously (and erroneously) treated as part of
      the pattern.
    - The library can now be built with mbedTLS support for HTTPS.
    - The diff status character 'T' will now be presented by the
      git_diff_status_char API for diff entries that change type.
    - Revision walks previously would sometimes include commits
      that should have been ignored; this is corrected.
    - Revision walks are now more efficient when the output is
      unsorted; we now avoid walking all the way to the beginning
      of history unnecessarily.
    - Error-handling around index extension loading has been fixed.
      We were previously always misreporting a truncated index.
  * API additions:
    - The index may now be iterated atomically using
      git_index_iterator.
    - Remote objects can now be created with extended options using
      the git_remote_create_with_opts API.
    - Diff objects can now be applied as changes to the working
      directory, index or both, emulating the git apply command.
      Additionally, git_apply_to_tree can apply those changes to a
      tree object as a fully in-memory operation.
    - You can now swap out memory allocators via the
      GIT_OPT_SET_ALLOCATOR option with git_libgit2_opts().
    - You can now ensure that functions do not discard unwritten
      changes to the index via the
      GIT_OPT_ENABLE_UNSAVED_INDEX_SAFETY option to
      git_libgit2_opts(). This will cause functions that implicitly
      re-read the index (eg, git_checkout) to fail if you have
      staged changes to the index but you have not written the
      index to disk. (Unless the checkout has the FORCE flag
      specified.)
    - At present, this defaults to off, but we intend to enable
      this more broadly in the future, as a warning or error. We
      encourage you to examine your code to ensure that you are not
      relying on the current behavior that implicitly removes
      staged changes.
    - Reference specifications can be parsed from an arbitrary
      string with the git_refspec_parse API.
    - You can now get the name and path of worktrees using the
      git_worktree_name and git_worktree_path APIs, respectively.
    - The ref field has been added to git_worktree_add_options to
      enable the creation of a worktree from a pre-existing branch.
    - It's now possible to analyze merge relationships between any
      two references, not just against HEAD, using
      git_merge_analysis_for_ref.
  * API removals:
    - The git_buf_free API is deprecated; it has been renamed to
      git_buf_dispose for consistency. The git_buf_free API will be
      retained for backward compatibility for the foreseeable
      future.
    - The git_otype enumeration and its members are deprecated and
      have been renamed for consistency. The GIT_OBJ_ enumeration
      values are now prefixed with GIT_OBJECT_. The old
      enumerations and macros will be retained for backward
      compatibility for the foreseeable future.
    - Several index-related APIs have been renamed for consistency.
      The GIT_IDXENTRY_ enumeration values and macros have been
      renamed to be prefixed with GIT_INDEX_ENTRY_. The
      GIT_INDEXCAP enumeration values are now prefixed with
      GIT_INDEX_CAPABILITY_. The old enumerations and macros will
      be retained for backward compatibility for the foreseeable
      future.
    - The error functions and enumeration values have been renamed
      for consistency. The giterr_ functions and values prefix have
      been renamed to be prefixed with git_error_; similarly,
      the GITERR_ constants have been renamed to be prefixed with
      GIT_ERROR_. The old enumerations and macros will be retained
      for backward compatibility for the foreseeable future.
  * Breaking API changes:
    - The default checkout strategy changed from DRY_RUN to SAFE.
    - Adding a symlink as .gitmodules into the index from the
      workdir or checking out such files is not allowed as this can
      make a Git implementation write outside of the repository and
      bypass the fsck checks for CVE-2018-11235.
- Bump sover to 28 following upstreams changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 01:52:34 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 0.27.0:
  - Changes or improvements
    - Improved p_unlink in posix_w32.c to try and make a file
      writable before sleeping in the retry loop to prevent
      unnecessary calls to sleep.
    - The CMake build infrastructure has been improved to speed up
      building time.
    - A new CMake option "-DUSE_HTTPS=" makes it possible to
      explicitly choose an HTTP backend.
    - A new CMake option "-DSHA1_BACKEND=" makes it possible to
      explicitly choose an SHA1 backend. The collision-detecting
      backend is now the default.
    - A new CMake option "-DUSE_BUNDLED_ZLIB" makes it possible to
      explicitly use the bundled zlib library.
    - A new CMake option "-DENABLE_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS" makes it
      possible to generate a reproducible static archive. This
      requires support from your toolchain.
    - The minimum required CMake version has been bumped to 2.8.11.
    - Writing to a configuration file now preserves the case of the
      key given by the caller for the case-insensitive portions of
      the key (existing sections are used even if they don't
      match).
    - We now support conditional includes in configuration files.
    - Fix for handling re-reading of configuration files with
      includes.
    - Fix for reading patches which contain exact renames only.
    - Fix for reading patches with whitespace in the compared
      files' paths.
    - We will now fill FETCH_HEAD from all passed refspecs instead
      of overwriting with the last one.
    - There is a new diff option, GIT_DIFF_INDENT_HEURISTIC which
      activates a heuristic which takes into account whitespace and
      indentation in order to produce better diffs when dealing
      with ambiguous diff hunks.
    - Fix for pattern-based ignore rules where files ignored by a
      rule cannot be un-ignored by another rule.
    - Sockets opened by libgit2 are now being closed on exec(3) if
      the platform supports it.
    - Fix for peeling annotated tags from packed-refs files.
    - Fix reading huge loose objects from the object database.
    - Fix files not being treated as modified when only the file
      mode has changed.
    - We now explicitly reject adding submodules to the index via
      git_index_add_frombuffer.
    - Fix handling of GIT_DIFF_FIND_RENAMES_FROM_REWRITES raising
      SIGABRT when one file has been deleted and another file has
      been rewritten.
    - Fix for WinHTTP not properly handling NTLM and Negotiate
      challenges.
    - When using SSH-based transports, we now repeatedly ask for
      the passphrase to decrypt the private key in case a wrong
      passphrase is being provided.
    - When generating conflict markers, they will now use the same
      line endings as the rest of the file.
  - API additions
    - The git_merge_file_options structure now contains a new
      setting, marker_size. This allows users to set the size of
      markers that delineate the sides of merged files in the
      output conflict file.  By default this is 7
      (GIT_MERGE_CONFLICT_MARKER_SIZE), which produces output
      markers like <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>.
    - git_remote_create_detached() creates a remote that is not
      associated to any repository (and does not apply
      configuration like 'insteadof' rules).  This is mostly useful
      for e.g. emulating git ls-remote behavior.
    - git_diff_patchid() lets you generate patch IDs for diffs.
    - git_status_options now has an additional field baseline to
      allow creating status lists against different trees.
    - New family of functions to allow creating notes for a
      specific notes commit instead of for a notes reference.
    - New family of functions to allow parsing message trailers.
      This API is still experimental and may change in future
      releases.
  - Breaking API changes
    - Signatures now distinguish between +0000 and -0000 UTC offsets.
    - The certificate check callback in the WinHTTP transport will
      now receive the message_cb_payload instead of the
      cred_acquire_payload.
    - We are now reading symlinked directories under .git/refs.
    - We now refuse creating branches named "HEAD".
    - We now refuse reading and writing all-zero object IDs into
      the object database.
    - We now read the effective user's configuration file instead
      of the real user's configuration in case libgit2 runs as part
      of a setuid binary.
    - The git_odb_open_rstream function and its readstream callback
      in the git_odb_backend interface have changed their
      signatures to allow providing the object's size and type to
      the caller.

- libgit2 0.24.1:
  + various compatible backported bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 17:27:05 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.24.0:
  + Custom filters can now be registered with wildcard attributes,
    for example filter=*. Consumers should examine the attributes
    parameter of the check function for details.
  + Symlinks are now followed when locking a file, which can be
    necessary when multiple worktrees share a base repository.
  + You can now set your own user-agent to be sent for HTTP
    requests by using the GIT_OPT_SET_USER_AGENT with
    git_libgit2_opts().
  + You can set custom HTTP header fields to be sent along with
    requests by passing them in the fetch and push options.
  + Tree objects are now assumed to be sorted. If a tree is not
    correctly formed, it will give bad results. This is the git
    approach and cuts a significant amount of time when reading the
    trees.
  + Filter registration is now protected against concurrent
    registration.
  + Filenames which are not valid on Windows in an index no longer
    cause to fail to parse it on that OS.
  + Rebases can now be performed purely in-memory, without touching
    the repository's workdir.
  + When adding objects to the index, or when creating new tree or
    commit objects, the inputs are validated to ensure that the
    dependent objects exist and are of the correct type. This
    object validation can be disabled with the
    GIT_OPT_ENABLE_STRICT_OBJECT_CREATION option.
  + The WinHTTP transport's handling of bad credentials now behaves
    like the others, asking for credentials again.
  + Various API changes (additions AND removals).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 12:34:52 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.23.0:
  + Changes or improvements:
    - Patience and minimal diff drivers can now be used for merges.
    - Merges can now ignore whitespace changes.
    - Updated binary identification in CRLF filtering to avoid
      false positives in UTF-8 files.
    - Rename and copy detection is enabled for small files.
    - Checkout can now handle an initial checkout of a repository,
      making GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE_CREATE unnecessary for users of
      clone.
    - The signature parameter in the ref-modifying functions has
      been removed. Use git_repository_set_ident() and
      git_repository_ident() to override the signature to be used.
    - The local transport now auto-scales the number of threads to
      use when creating the packfile instead of sticking to one.
    - Reference renaming now uses the right id for the old value.
    - The annotated version of branch creation, HEAD detaching and
      reset allow for specifying the expression from the user to be
      put into the reflog.
    - git_rebase_commit now returns GIT_EUNMERGED when you attempt
      to commit with unstaged changes.
    - On Mac OS X, we now use SecureTransport to provide the
      cryptographic support for HTTPS connections insead of
      OpenSSL.
    - Checkout can now accept an index for the baseline
      computations via the baseline_index member.
    - The configuration for fetching is no longer stored inside the
      git_remote struct but has been moved to a git_fetch_options.
      The remote functions now take these options or the callbacks
      instead of setting them beforehand.
    - git_submodule instances are no longer cached or shared across
      lookup. Each submodule represents the configuration at the
      time of loading.
    - The index now uses diffs for add_all() and update_all() which
      gives it a speed boost and closer semantics to git.
    - The ssh transport now reports the stderr output from the
      server as the error message, which allows you to get the
      "repository not found" messages.
    - git_index_conflict_add() will remove staged entries that
      exist for conflicted paths.
    - The flags for a git_diff_file will now have the
      GIT_DIFF_FLAG_EXISTS bit set when a file exists on that side
      of the diff. This is useful for understanding whether a side
      of the diff exists in the presence of a conflict.
    - The constructor for a write-stream into the odb now takes
      git_off_t instead of size_t for the size of the blob, which
      allows putting large files into the odb on 32-bit systems.
    - The remote's push and pull URLs now honor the
      url.$URL.insteadOf configuration. This allows modifying URL
      prefixes to a custom value via gitconfig.
    - git_diff_foreach, git_diff_blobs, git_diff_blob_to_buffer,
      and git_diff_buffers now accept a new binary callback of type
      git_diff_binary_cb that includes the binary diff information.
    - The race condition mitigations described in racy-git.txt have
      been implemented.
    - If libcurl is installed, we will use it to connect to HTTP(S)
      servers.
  + Various API changes (incl. breaking changes).
- Rename libgit2-22 subpackage to libgit2-23, following upstreams
  soname bump (also in baselibs.conf).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 27 20:40:51 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.22.1:
  + The following (critical) fixes have been backported to this
    maintenance release:
    - checkout: introduce git_checkout_perfdata.
    - git_path_join_unrooted: return base len.
    - checkout: don't recreate previous directory.
    - checkout tests: nasty symlinks.
    - checkout: drop newline in error message.
    - checkout: remove files before writing new ones.
    - checkout tests: emulate p_realpath poorly on Win32.
    - checkout tests: cleanup realpath impl on Win32.
- Changes from version 0.22.0:
  + git_signature_new() now requires a non-empty email address.
  + Use CommonCrypto libraries for SHA-1 calculation on Mac OS X.
  + Disable SSL compression and SSLv2 and SSLv3 ciphers in favor of
    TLSv1 in OpenSSL.
  + The fetch behavior of remotes with autotag set to
    GIT_REMOTE_DOWNLOAD_TAGS_ALL has been changed to match git
    1.9.0 and later. In this mode, libgit2 now fetches all tags in
    addition to whatever else needs to be fetched.
  + git_checkout() now handles case-changing renames correctly on
    case-insensitive filesystems; for example renaming "readme" to
    "README".
  + The search for libssh2 is now done via pkg-config instead of a
    custom search of a few directories.
  + Add support for core.protectHFS and core.protectNTFS. Add more
    validation for filenames which we write such as references.
  + The local transport now generates textual progress output like
    git-upload-pack does ("counting objects").
  + git_checkout_index() can now check out an in-memory index that
    is not necessarily the repository's index, so you may check out
    an index that was produced by git_merge and friends while
    retaining the cached information.
  + Remove the default timeout for receiving / sending data over
    HTTP using the WinHTTP transport layer.
  + Add SPNEGO (Kerberos) authentication using GSSAPI on Unix
    systems.
  + Provide built-in objects for the empty blob (e69de29) and empty
    tree (4b825dc) objects.
  + The index' tree cache is now filled upon read-tree and
    write-tree and the cache is written to disk.
  + LF -> CRLF filter refuses to handle mixed-EOL files.
  + LF -> CRLF filter now runs when * text = auto (with Git for
    Windows 1.9.4).
  + File unlocks are atomic again via rename. Read-only files on
    Windows are made read-write if necessary.
  + Share open packfiles across repositories to share descriptors
    and mmaps.
  + Use a map for the treebuilder, making insertion O(1).
  + The build system now accepts an option EMBED_SSH_PATH which
    when set tells it to include a copy of libssh2 at the given
    location. This is enabled for MSVC.
  + Add support for refspecs with the asterisk in the middle of a
    pattern.
  + Fetching now performs opportunistic updates. To achieve this,
    we introduce a difference between active and passive refspecs,
    which make git_remote_download() and git_remote_fetch() to take
    a list of resfpecs to be the active list, similarly to how git
    fetch accepts a list on the command-line.
  + The THREADSAFE option to build libgit2 with threading support
    has been flipped to be on by default.
  + The remote object has learnt to prune remote-tracking branches.
    If the remote is configured to do so, this will happen via
    git_remote_fetch(). You can also call git_remote_prune() after
    connecting or fetching to perform the prune.
- Rename libgit2-21 subpackage to libgit2-22, following upstreams
  soname bump (also in baselibs.conf).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 10 21:37:25 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.21.1:
  + Added a new config snapshotting API to fix race issues when
    different applications (e.g. Git and a libgit2 client) access
    the same repository simultaneously.
  + Added reflog support to all APIs that could alter a reference.
  + Avoided race conditions when updating references.
  + Converted all APIs that output string data to use git_buf
    objects for the return value.
  + Added standard git_<object>_init_options functions to
    initialize options structures when static initialization is not
    possible, and renamed options structures to standard
    git_<object>_options (replacing _opts suffix used in some
    places).
  + Improved use of const on pointers in many APIs (which may
    affect some bindings).
  + Replaced use of oid with simply id for references to
    git_oid value.s
  + Previously, when a callback function returned an error value
    (i.e. non-zero), libgit2 converted it to GIT_EUSER for the
    parent function's return value. Now, libgit2 tries to pass
    through the callback's return value all the way back to the
    caller.
  + All inline functions were eliminated from the public libgit2
    API.
  + Removed all Apache licensed code from library.
  + For more changes, please see detailed ChangeLog in package.
- Rename libgit2-0 subpackage to libgit2-21, following upstreams

- Update to version 0.18:
  + Almost one year worth of bug fixing... yet, upstream does not
    publish a statement / announcement of what is actually new...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 31 13:27:15 UTC 2012 - cgiboudeaux@gmx.com

- Update to 0.17
    Attributes:
        - Added function macros to check attribute values instead of having
        to manually compare them

        - Added helper to push/hide a single reference to the walker
    Status:
        - Greatly improved Status implementation using the new `diff` code
        as a backend
    Submodules:
        - Added a partial submodules API to get information about a
        submodule and list all the submodules in a repository
                - git_submodule_foreach
                - git_submodule_lookup
    Tag:
        - Added `git_tag_peel` helper to peel a tag to its pointed object
        - Tag messages are now filtered to match Git rules (stripping comments
        and adding proper whitespacing rules)
    Tree:
        - Killed the old `git_tree_diff` API, which is replaced by the
        new diff code.

- Update to 0.16.0
  - Git Attributes support (see git2/attr.h)
      There is now support to efficiently parse and retrieve information
      from `.gitattribute` files in a repository. Note that this
      information is not yet used e.g. when checking out files.

  - .gitignore support
      Likewise, all the operations that are affected by `.gitignore` files
      now take into account the global, user and local ignores when
      skipping the relevant files.

  - Cleanup of the object ownership semantics
      The ownership semantics for all repository subparts (index, odb,
      config files, etc) has been redesigned. All these objects are now
      reference counted, and can be hot-swapped in the middle of
      execution, allowing for instance to add a working directory and an
      index to a repository that was previously opened as bare, or to
      change the source of the ODB objects after initialization.

      Consequently, the repository API has been simplified to remove all
      the `_openX` calls that allowed setting these subparts *before*
      initialization.

  - git_index_read_tree()
      Git trees can now be read into the index.

  - More reflog functionality
      The reference log has been optimized, and new API calls to rename
      and delete the logs for a reference have been added.

  - Rewrite of the References code with explicit ownership semantics
      The references code has been mostly rewritten to take into account
      the cases where another Git application was modifying a repository's
      references while the Library was running.

      References are now explicitly loaded and free'd by the user, and
      they may be reloaded in the middle of execution if the user suspects
      that their values may have changed on disk. Despite the new
      ownership semantics, the references API stays the same.

  - Simplified the Remotes API
      Some of the more complex Remote calls have been refactored into
      higher level ones, to facilitate the usual `fetch` workflow of a
      repository.

  - Greatly improved thread-safety
      The library no longer has race conditions when loading objects from
      the same ODB and different threads at the same time. There's now
      full TLS support, even for error codes. When the library is built
      with `THREADSAFE=1`, the threading support must be globally
      initialized before it can be used (see `git_threads_init()`)

  - Tree walking API
      A new API can recursively traverse trees and subtrees issuing callbacks for
      every single entry.

  - Tree diff API
      There is basic support for diff'ing an index against two trees.
