  <title>The GNOME 2.x Desktop Base Libraries</title>
  <description>This package contains the basic libraries for the GNOME 2.x Desktop
platform. GNOME has no specific window manager. You are totally free in
your choice. Many GNOME users like Sawfish, Enlightenment, or IceWM as
a window manager for GNOME (see those packages).</description>
