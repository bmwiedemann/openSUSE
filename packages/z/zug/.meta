  <title>Transducers for C++</title>
  <description>zug is a C++ library providing transducers. Transducers are composable
sequential transformations independent of the source. They can be used to
express algorithms over pull-based sequences (iterators, files) but also push
based sequences (signals, events, asynchronous streams) in a generic way.
