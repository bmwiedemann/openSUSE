-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 17 09:31:15 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Updated to 0.1.1:
  * Display a message box about in case old docset storage is found
  * Follow a new versioning scheme. (#203)
  * Added support for Dash protocols  dash:  and  dash-plugin: 
    on Linux and Windows. (#247)
  * Revamped settings dialogue with more intuitive options.
  * Added a build option for portable mode ( qmake
    CONFIG+=portable ). In this case settings are stored in
    zeal.ini  next to the Zeal executable, and docset storage path
    defaults to  docsets  subdirectory. Changing docset storage
    path via the settings dialogue has only temporary effect, and
    it is not saved on application exit. It is still possible to
    set a permanent custom path by manually editing  zeal.ini .
  * Zeal now relies on its own server for obtaining docset list,
    rather than parsing Dash website.
  * Now the docset list is cached for 24 hours,
    but can be manually reloaded. (#287)
  * Implemented version check function
    ( Help  ->  Check for Update... ). (#282)
  * Improved display of docset download/unpack progress. (#252)
  * Now the main window of the running Zeal instance is brought up
    on attempt to start the app again. (#187)
  * Provided MSI installer for Windows users. (#279)
