  <title>Pack Program</title>
  <description>Zoo is a packer based on the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Lots of files on
DOS/AmigaDOS and TOS systems used this packer for their archives. The
compression rate of gzip is not reached, and thus zoo should only be
used for decompressing old archives.</description>
