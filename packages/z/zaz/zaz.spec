%description
Zaz (Zaz ain't Z***) is a game where the player has to get rid of
incoming balls by arranging them in triplets. The idea of the game
is loosely based on games like Luxor, Zuma and Puzzle Bobble.
The twists that make Zaz stand out from other games of this type are
that the balls have to be picked from the path
(insted of being randomly assigned for the player) and that
the player's "vehicle" is also attached to a path which is different
from level to level.
A 3D accelerator is needed for decent gameplay.
