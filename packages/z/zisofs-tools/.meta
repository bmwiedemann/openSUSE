  <title>User tools for zisofs</title>
  <description>Zisofs-tools, in conjunction with a zisofs-enabled system, allows the
creation of an iso9660 filesystem that can be decompressed &quot;live&quot; on a
file-by-file basis, while still being readable by systems without
zisofs support. This package contains the tools necessary to create
such a filesystem and read compressed files on a system without zisofs
support.</description>
