- New upstream version 4.3.3:
  * Denial-of-Service on CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by
    unauthenticated clients. (CVE-2020-15166, bsc#1176116)
    If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully
    configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange
    any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to
    the library, but the server application never receives them.
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m
  * Stack overflow on server running PUB/XPUB socket (CURVE disabled).
    The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive
    function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are
    NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the
    length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote
    clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An
    attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such
    that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow. (bsc#1176258)
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8
  * Memory leak in PUB server induced by malicious client(s) without CURVE/ZAP.
    Messages with metadata are never processed by PUB sockets, but the metadata
    is kept referenced in the PUB object and never freed. (bsc#1176257)
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw
  * Memory leak in client induced by malicious server(s) without CURVE/ZAP.
    When a pipe processes a delimiter and is already not in active state but
    still has an unfinished message, the message is leaked. (bsc#1176259)
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87
  * Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packets (CURVE disabled).
    By crafting a packet which is not valid ZMTP v2/v3, and which has two
    messages larger than 8192 bytes, the decoder can be tricked into changing
    the recorded size of the 8192 bytes static buffer, which then gets overflown
    by the next message. The content that gets written in the overflown memory
    is entirely decided by the sender. (bsc#1176256)
    For more information see the security advisory:
    https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6

Tue Jul  9 07:35:29 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- New upstream version 4.3.2:
  * CVE-2019-13132: a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a
    libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE
    encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and
    overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in
    the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration
    are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no
    known mitigations. (bsc#1140255)
  * New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_socket_monitor_versioned API that supports
    a versioned monitoring events protocol as a parameter. Passing 1 results in
    the same behaviour as zmq_socket_monitor.
  * New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_socket_monitor_pipes_stats that triggers
    a new ZMQ_EVENT_PIPES_STATS to be delivered via zmq_socket_monitor_versioned
    v2 API, which contains the current status of all the queues owned by the
    monitored socket. See doc/zmq_socket_monitor_versioned.txt for details.
  * New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq_poller_fd that returns the FD of a thread
    safe socket.
  * New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:
        ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL_LAST_VALUE is similar to ZMQ_XPUB_MANUAL but allows to avoid
        duplicates when using last value caching.
        ZMQ_SOCKS_USERNAME and ZMQ_SOCKS_PASSWORD that implement SOCKS5 proxy
        authentication.

- New upstream version 4.3.1:
  * CVE-2019-6250: A vulnerability has been found that would allow
    attackers to direct a peer to jump to and execute from an address
    indicated by the attacker. (bsc#1121717)
  * fixed race condition in ZMQ_PUSH when quickly disconnecting and
    reconnecting causes last part of multi-part message to get
    "stuck" and resent by mistake to the new socket.

    ZAP handler fail. See ZMQ_ZAP_ENFORCE_DOMAIN
  * clarify in zmq_close manpage that the operation will
    complete asynchronously.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 22 07:07:58 UTC 2018 - adam.majer@suse.de

    - ZMQ_LOOPBACK_FASTPATH to enable faster TCP loopback on Windows
    - ZMQ_METADATA to set application-specific metadata on a socket
    See doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq_getsockopt.txt for details.
  * New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) context options:
    - ZMQ_ZERO_COPY_RECV to disable zero-copy receive to save memory
    at the expense of slower performance
    See doc/zmq_ctx_set.txt and doc/zmq_ctx_get.txt for details.
  * New DRAFT API zmq_stopwatch_intermediate which returns the time
    elapsed without stopping the stopwatch.
  * TIPC: support addressing TIPC Port Identity addresses.
  * fix ZMQ_DISH over UDP triggers errno_assert() after watermark
  * fix ZMQ_PUB crash when due to high volume of subscribe and
    unsubscribe messages, an unmatched unsubscribe message is
    received in certain conditions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 08:00:12 UTC 2017 - adam.majer@suse.de

- New upstream version 4.2.3
   * API change: previously ZMQ_POLLOUT on a ZMQ_ROUTER socket
     returned always true due to how the type works. When
     ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY is set, sending fails when the peer is
     not available, but ZMQ_POLLOUT always returns true anyway,
     which does not make sense. Now when ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY is
     set, ZMQ_POLLOUT on a ZMQ_ROUTER will return true only if
     at least one peer is available.
     Given ZMQ_POLLOUT with ZMQ_ROUTER was not usable at all
     previously, we do not consider this a breakage warranting a
     major or minor version increase.
   * ZMQ_IDENTITY has been renamed to ZMQ_ROUTING_ID and
     ZMQ_CONNECT_RID has been renamed to ZMQ_CONNTECT_ROUTING_ID
     to disambiguate. ZMQ_IDENTITY and ZMQ_CONNECT_RID are still
     available to keep backward compatibility, and will be
     removed in a future release after further advance notice.
   * DRAFT API change: zmq_poller_wait, zmq_poller_wait_all and
     zmq_poller_poll have been changed to be inline with other
     existing APIs that have a timeout to return EAGAIN instead
     of ETIMEDOUT as the errno value.
   * Existing non-DRAFT socket types ZMQ_REP/REQ, ZMQ_ROUTER/DEALER
     and ZMQPUB/SUB, that were previously declared deprecated, have
     been reinstated as stable and supported
   * Curve: all remaining traces of debug output to console are now
     removed, and new DRAFT events are available to properly debug
     CURVE, PLAIN, GSSAPI and ZAP events and failures.
   * for compelete changelog see
     https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.2.3
- drop remove_werror.patch: can now be disabled at configure time,
