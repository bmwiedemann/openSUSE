- instead of having 2 different build paths just update the rust
  flags define with the override so we can have one common build
  path

  a service file -> Switch to zst for compression here as well
- Add required overrides for the rust bugs in the service file so
  that it can use the newer cargo_vendor service
- make the conditionals for using mold more descriptive
- update license string and %license list
- Update BR list based on pkgconfig calls in the build.rs files
- Add BR for highcolor-icon-theme so we dont have to own the
  directory
