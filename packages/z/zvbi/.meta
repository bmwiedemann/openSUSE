  <title>Linux &quot;VBI proxy&quot;</title>
  <description>With &quot;video4linux&quot; drivers only one application at a time can capture
VBI data.  The 2nd generation &quot;v4l2&quot; API allows multiple clients to
open a device, but still only one client may read from the device.  If
for example the Nxtvepg daemon runs in the background users will not be
able to start a Teletext application.  The VBI proxy was developed as a
solution to this problem.</description>
