      this can be used to signal a system-wide restart request
      after an update.
    - Fixed a bug in TableLookup because of which the internal
      cache wasn't being used.
    - Added a new option, activated by the

      after all InsertEvent actions have been completed, not once
      for every event.
    - Speed up the initial query retrieving the last event ID by

    - lp#592599: FindEvent*: Event subjects are now joined by a
      logical AND instead of OR.
    - Extensions found in the extensions directory are now
      automatically loaded.
    - Install a .pc file so out of tree extensions can figure out
      the install path.
    - Load extensions found in ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions.
    - lp#523761: Let the GtkRecentlyUsed data-source ignore any
      exceptions while trying to parse .desktop files.
    - Fix return value of the SetDataSourceEnabled D-Bus method.
    - lp#592599, lp#604747: Extensions: Hooks have been renamed and
      most of them now have pre and post variants.
    - Add new ResultTypes for sorting by subject origin
    - Change the hooks API for the Extension class to use pre_* and
      post* hooks to make it clearer when they are run. This change
      also brings in a few new hooks.
  + Python API:
    - ZeitgeistDBusInterface.get_extension is no longer a
      classmethod (in fact, it never really was).
    - ZeitgeistDBusInterface.get_extension now has a third optional
      parameter to change the bus name.
  + Overall:
    - lp#595577: Build system fixes.
    - Manpage updates.
  + Updated translations.
- The .pc file is kept in the main package, as a split for this
  file alone does not make sense and it does not drag in any other
  -devel packages.

Thu Jul  8 00:14:55 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + Engine:
    - Compile the shared-desktop-ontolgies (aka Nepomuk (aka
      OSCAF)) into Python code at build time, and use them for out
      subject classification system
    - You can now negate the fields uri, interpretation,
      manifestation, origin, and mimetype, in event templates by
      prepending the field value with an exclamation mark '!'.
    - You can truncate (aka wildcard) the subject fields uri,
      origin, and mimetype in event templates by appending an
      asterisk '*' to the string.
    - Event templates now match on all child types of the specified
      interpretations and manifestations. Ie. Interpretation.IMAGE
      also matches RASTER_IMAGE and VECTOR_IMAGE.
    - The core database schema is now versioned, meaning that we
      can migrate data if the DB ever needs to change in layout. It
      also brings slightly faster startup of the daemon when we
      detect that the schema version is what we expect
    - Two new environment variables ZEITGEIST_DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS
      and ZEITGEIST_EXTRA_EXTENSIONS controlling which extensions
      are loaded
    - Man pages updated with --no-datahub and environment variables
      to control the data paths and loaded extensions
    - Auto upgrades of schemas
    - Some Nepomuk type URIs where wrong and will be fixed
      automatically in the schema upgrade of the DB
    - Fix DeleteEvents to work with arbitrarily huge amounts of
      IDs.
    - Set event.id before passing events to the extension hooks so
      extensions can make use of the event ids
  + Python API:
    - TimeRange sprouted a few new useful methods.
  + Ontology:
    - Removed {Interpretation,Manifestation}.UNKNOWN. If you really
      really (like really!) can not come up with a good
      interpretation or manifestation don't log it - or insert an
      empty string instead.
    - What was subject's Manifestation.WEB_HISTORY is now
      represented by a combination of Interpretation.WEBSITE and
      Manifestation.REMOTE_DATA_OBJECT.
    - Manifestation.FILE has been renamed to
      Manifestation.FILE_DATA_OBJECT.
    - Event interpretations OPEN_EVENT and VISIT_EVENT has been
      coalesced into a new interpretation type called ACCESS_EVENT.
    - Event interpretation SAVE_EVENT has been coalesced into
      MODIFY_EVENT.
    - The following interpretations has been removed because we
      need a suitable alternative defined in the Nepomuk/OSCAF
      scope: BROADCAST_MESSAGE, FEED_MESSAGE, SYSTEM_RESOURCE,
      NOTE.
    - Interpretation.MUSIC is now Interpretation.AUDIO.
    - The following event interpretations has been removed because
      they had unclear meanings or limited general usefulness:
      FOCUS_EVENT, WARN_EVENT, ERROR_EVENT.
  + Overall:
    - Other fixes and code enhancements.
    - Manpage updates.
  + Updated translations.
- Add raptor, python-xml and python-rdflib BuildRequires.
- Add python-rdflib Requires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  4 14:50:15 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Use a valid RPM group: Productivity/Other. Note that it's not a
  file manager, so Productivity/File utilities is not appropriate.

- Update to version 0.3.3.1:
  + Engine:
    - Added a LastSeen property to data-sources.

- Changes from version 0.3.3:
  + Engine:
    - lp#493903: Added MostPopularActor, LeastPopularActor,
      MostRecentActor and LeastRecentActor as possible ReturnTypes
      for FindEvents and FindEventsId
    - Let {Find,Get,Insert}* hooks know the bus name of the caller,
      when executed over D-Bus.
    - Add an extension implementing a data-source registry
      (allowing to disable data-sources from a centralized place
      and see their description).
    - Overhauled FindRelatedUris for better results and improved
      performance.
    - lp#490242: Changed FindEvents, FindEventIds and
      FindRelatedUris to not treat zeros in the given TimeRange
      specially; "(0, 0)" can no longer be used
    - lp#526357: Fixed a crash in the GtkRecentlyUsed data-source
      parsing malfored .desktop files (LP: #526357)
    - lp#510761: Added support for more file mimetypes
    - lp#523761: Fixed a crash in the GtkRecentlyUsed data-source
      trying to read broken symlinks disguised as .desktop files

      which happened when there was no display friendly version of
      a URI

      printed by zeitgeist-datahub is no longer visible in
      zeitgeist-daemon's output.
    - Added --log-level option to change the output verbosity.
    - lp#491646: DeleteEvents now correctly removes any
      unreferenced values (URIs, actors, etc.) and not only the
      events themselves
    - lp#557708: Fixed insertion of events with a payload
    - Fixed an exception in DeleteEvents.
    - lp#566184: Fixed event deletions not always getting committed

  + Python API:
    - Made the Interpretation and Manifestation classes iterable.
    - Added symbol lookup by URI, in the form of dictionary access.
    - Fixed the display name for Interpretation.SOURCECODE.
    - lp#510804: Fixed find_events_for_values and

      get convenient access to D-Bus interfaces provided by engine
      extensions.
  + Overall:
    - More fixes and code enhancements.
    - Manpage updates.
    - Translation updates.

Wed Jan 20 11:44:23 UTC 2010 - awafaa@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.2:
  + Added FindEvents, optimized shorthand for 
    GetEvents(FindEventIds(…)).
  + Fixed DeleteEvents and make it ignore bad requests.
  + Fixed GetEvents not to raise an exception when called with an

    fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 16:32:33 CET 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.3.1:
  + Add a FindRelatedUris() method to the core DBus API (also to
    the Python client lib). This can be used to find URIs that
    occur in relation to a set of events, sorted by relevancy.
  + The Zeitgeist engine now exposes a Blacklist API over DBus
    which can be used to block events from entering the log
  + The engine now also exposes a fine grained monitoring system
    that can be used to listen for updates to the log
  + InsertEvents() now return an event id of 0 for events that are
    blocked or otherwise fail insertion
  + Extensions can now provide hooks to block or change events
    before they are inserted into the log
  + Remove support for more than one backend. What was known as the
    "Resonance backend" is now just "the engine"
  + Removed method from DBus API GetLastTimestampForActor
  + Lots more unit tests added
  + The engine will now load a default set of extensions on startup
  + Overhaul and restructure our Sphinx-based API-documentation
    system.
  + API documentation is more or less at 100% both for the DBus API
    and the Python client library
  + Bash completion for zeitgeist-daemon
  + Code style cleanups
  + Bugfix: You may now request more than 999 events in one go from
    GetEvents()
  + Bugfix: In find_eventids where using more than one event
    template resulted in all but the first one ignoring the
    timestamp restriction
  + Bugfix: Fix URL of Interpretation.APPLICATION to correct
    Nepomuk URI
  + More bugfixes
- Changes from version 0.3.0:
  + Disclaimers:
    - Support querying only for available items (eg. filtering out
      deleted files, not listing files on detached USB storage,
      etc.) is exposed in the API but doesn't work yet.
    - The database layout may change again before 0.4.0.
    - The event ontologies are not yet set in stone, and minor
      changes are expected
    - Only one logger is enabled for now: the one monitoring recent
      files. In coming releases this logger may well be deprecated
      in favour of application specific plugins.
  + Complete rework of engine and DBus API.
  + Public Python client API defined in zeitgeist.datamodel and
    zeitgeist.client modules
  + Documented public API with Sphinx
  + Changed Ontology from XESAM to Nepomuk.
  + Removed the Storm backend (obsoleted in 0.2.1).
  + Removed the Querymancer backend.
  + Support for event payloads (binary attachments to events)
  + An extension API for the core engine, allowing extensions
    direct access to the DB
- Change python-devel BuildRequires to python.
- Change python-gtk Requires to a Recommends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 12:07:52 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Add python-gnome and python-gtk Requires.

- Updated to version 0.2.1
  + Fully backwards compatible.
  + Added compatibility with Python version 2.5.
  + Removed the Storm dependency, obtaining general performance
    improvements.
  + Removed the need for a patched PyGTK.
  + Made the GtkRecentlyUser logger more robust (fixes an infinit
    loop on some systems).
  + Improved performance of DeleteItems and UpdateItems.
  + Fixed a problem with the contents of the EventsChanged signal.
  + Fixed InsertEvents to enforce "mimetype" as a required value.
  + Fixed a bug where the sorting_asc=True in FindEvents would be
    ignored if used together with mode="mostused" (lp#404947).
  + Highly improved caching.
  + Added a "--quit" option to zeitgeist-daemon to stop any running
    daemon.
  + General code improvements, new test cases and other minor fixes
