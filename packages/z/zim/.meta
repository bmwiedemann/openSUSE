  <description>Zim aims at bringing the concept of a wiki to your desktop. For example
every page is saved as a text file with wiki markup. Pages can contain
links to other pages, and are saved automatically. Creating a new page
is as easy as linking to a non-exiting page. This tool is intended to
keep track of TODO lists or serve as a personal scratch book.
