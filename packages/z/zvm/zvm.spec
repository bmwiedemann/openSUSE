%description
Zig Version Manager (zvm) is a tool for managing your Zig installs. With std
under heavy development and a large feature roadmap, Zig is bound to continue
changing. Breaking existing builds, updating valid syntax, and introducing new
features like a package manager. While this is great for developers, it also
can lead to headaches when you need multiple versions of a language installed
to compile your projects, or a language gets updated frequently.
