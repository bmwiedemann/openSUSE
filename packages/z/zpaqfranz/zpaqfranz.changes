- update to 60.6:
  * Better -stdin management
    Now files added with -stdin should be deduplicated as well as
    those added manually (up to the previous version the
    deduplicator was less efficient, for a whole series of
    reasons long to explain)
  * New comparehex command
    This command performs an operation that happens very
    frequently, namely comparing two lines (typically HASH codes)
    present in two files. If the codes are the same it exits with
    OK. You can also impose the expected length of the hash.
  * Counts within more than one file the occurrences of a certain
    string, and returns OK if the number is the expected one In
    essence, within a log file, it counts how many positive
    results there are.
  * If you don't select a string to search for, it will use the
    default one for OKs with the -big switch
  * During program termination with Control-C press, a better
    management of the deletion of files created with -chunk is
    performed.
  * It might also perform rollback of .zpaq files, maybe in the
    future.
  * Apparently it should work in a portable way across various
    platforms, or at least I hope so.
  * The problem of terminating a multithreaded system based on a
    condition is not trivial, even from a performance
    perspective. I used "dirty tricks", we'll see in the future.
  * Improvement in the creation of temporary files, for the use
    of multiple zpaqfranz processes simultaneously
  * Temporary files are created inside different subfolders
    (marked with mtime) in order to reduce the risk of
    "collision" if multiple zpaqfranz are launched simultaneously.
  * Used to automate many convenient functions for backup logs.
  * Use -find/replace to fix path (if needed); -ssd for M/T
  * The t command (without a path) do NOT read something from
    filesystem
  * You have to use the t command WITH a path (or use the -verify
    switch)
  * The brand new -crc32 switch is makes a triple CRC-32
    comparing, READING from the filesystem.
  * In this case, the -find and -replace switches can be useful
    to transform the stored paths into physical paths (if they
    are different)
  * New -csv and -csvhf switches for l (list)
  * -external in add
  * hashdeep format
    But it's still using zpaqfranz: any bugs could still affect
    its reliability
  * For delicate situations we use an external program, which
    therefore doesn't have the possible bugs of zpaqfranz, such
    as hashdeep (in the Windows version hashdeep64 is faster)

  * -fast: store inside zpaq archive a "kind of" file list (to be developed)
  * ADS filelists (NTFS alternate data stream)
  * Getting password from console is changed, now should be run... everywhere
  * Colors on Windows

    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238781
  * disclaimer after help for USE THE DOUBLE QUOTES, LUKE!
  * changed $day, $hour... to %day, %hour ( Linux does not like
    '$' very much )
  * PowerPC fix
  * New switch -home in a command (add)
  * Stripped of about everything from zpaqfranz repository
