  <description>With Zhu3D you can view, animate and solve up to three functions in 3D-space in a interactive manner. In addition, you further can observe an independent parametric system. The OpenGL-viewer supports zooming, scaling, rotating, translating as
 well as filed lightning, transparency or surface-properties.

You have up to 8 independent lights or spotlights, background settings, miscellaneous wire-modes or global illumination models. Pictures are rendered as png or jpg and can have an arbitrary size. Numerical solutions of an equation-system are found with a quite fast and reliable adaptive random search</description>
