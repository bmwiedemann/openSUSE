  <title>A collection of LV2/LADSPA audio plugins for high quality processing</title>
  <description>The purpose of these plugins is to provide high quality DSP without
using an excessive amount of CPU, in an attempt to complement some of
the amazing work done on other free audio software projects by other
people. There is an exception: ZamValve has two different models one of
which uses very large proportion of CPU but has been commented that it
does sound much more realistic than the tanh model. The CPU hungry
version is in a separate git branch and is not selected by default but
can be compiled by switching to the zamvalve branch.

There currently is no documentation on how to use these plugins, but
anyone who is familiar with outboard gear should be able to work it out.
Plus the default settings and almost every slider is calibrated to
standard ranges.

The suite so far consists of:

ZamAutoSat - Automatic saturation plugin
ZamComp - Mono Compressor plugin*
ZamCompX2 - Stereo Compressor plugin*
ZamCompExp - Stereo Compressor/Expander plugin
ZamEQ2 - 2x parametric EQ (with high/lowshelf and HP/LP) plugin
ZamValve - Valve distortion (WDF physical model* or tanh*) plugin
ZamGEQ31 - Mono 31 band graphic equalizer plugin
ZamGEQ31X2 - Stereo 31 band graphic equalizer plugin
