%description
These plugins provide DSP. Of these, ZamValve has two different
models, one of which uses very large proportion of CPU, but has been
reported to produce more realistic sound than the tanh model.

There currently is no documentation on how to use these plugins, but
anyone who is familiar with outboard gear should be able to work it out.
The default settings and almost every slider is calibrated to
standard ranges.

The suite so far consists of:

ZamAutoSat - Automatic saturation plugin
ZamComp - Mono Compressor plugin
ZamCompX2 - Stereo Compressor plugin
ZamCompExp - Stereo Compressor/Expander plugin
ZamEQ2 - 2x parametric EQ (with high/lowshelf and HP/LP) plugin
ZamValve - Valve distortion (WDF physical model or tanh) plugin
ZamGEQ31 - Mono 31 band graphic equalizer plugin
ZamGEQ31X2 - Stereo 31 band graphic equalizer plugin
