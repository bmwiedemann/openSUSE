Fri Jun  1 15:02:25 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.0:
  * Add CMake build. Minimum supported CMake version is 3.1. For now ZNC can be built with either CMake or autoconf. In future autoconf is going to be removed.
  * Currently znc-buildmod requires python if CMake was used; if that's a concern for you, please open a bug.
  * Increase minimum GCC version from 4.7 to 4.8. Minimum Clang version stays at 3.2.
  * Make ZNC UI translateable to different languages (only with CMake), add partial Russian and German translations. (#1237) (#1354) (#1462)
  * If you want to translate ZNC to your language, please join https://crowdin.com/project/znc-bouncer
  * Configs written before ZNC 0.206 can't be read anymore (#929)
  * Implement IRCv3.2 capabilities away-notify, account-notify, extended-join (#315) (#316)
  * Implement IRCv3.2 capabilities echo-message, cap-notify on the "client side" (#950)
  * Update capability names as they are named in IRCv3.2: znc.in/server-time-iso→server-time, znc.in/batch→batch. Old names will continue working for a while, then will be removed in some future version.
  * Make ZNC request server-time from server when available (#839)
  * Increase accepted line length from 1024 to 2048 to give some space to message tags
  * Separate buffer size settings for channels and queries (#967)

  * Add network-specific config for cert validation in addition to user-supplied fingerprints: TrustAllCerts, defaults to false, and TrustPKI, defaults to true. (#866)
  * Add /attach command for symmetry with /detach. Unlike /join it allows wildcards.
  * Timestamp format now supports sub-second precision with %f. Used in awaystore, listsockets, log modules and buffer playback when client doesn't support server-time (#1455)
  * Build on macOS using ICU, Python, and OpenSSL from Homebrew, if available (#894)
  * Remove --with-openssl=/path option from ./configure. SSL is still supported and is still configurable

Wed Mar  7 17:31:43 UTC 2018 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.6.6:
  * Fix use-after-free in znc --makepem. It was broken for a long
    time, but started segfaulting only now. This is a useability
    fix, not a security fix, because self-signed (or signed by a
    CA) certificates can be created without using --makepem, and
    then combined into znc.pem.

Tue Nov 17 12:33:57 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.6.2
  * fixes
		+ Fixed a use-after-delete in webadmin. It was already 
			partially fixed in ZNC 1.4; since 1.4 it has been still 
			possible to trigger, but much harder.
		+ Fixed a startup failure when awaynick and simple_away were 
			both loaded, and simple_away had arguments.
		+ Fixed a build failure when using an ancient OpenSSL version.
		+ Fixed a build failure when using OpenSSL which was built 
			without SSLv3 support.
		+ Bindhost was sometimes used as ident.
		+ CAP :END wasn't parsed correctly, causing timeout during 
			login for some clients.
		+ Fixed channel keys if client joined several channels in 
			single command.
		+ Fixed memory leak when reading an invalid config.
	* autovoice
		+ Check for autovoices when we are opped.
	* controlpanel
		+ Fixed DelCTCPReply case-insensitivity.
	* dcc
		+ Add missing return statement. It was harmless.
	* modpython
		+ Fixed a memory leak.
	* modules_online
		+ Wrong ident was used before.
	* stickychan
		+ Fixed to unstick inaccessible channels to avoid infinite 
			join loops.
	* internal changes
		+ Fixed the nick passed to CModule::OnChanMsg() so it has 
			channel permissions set.
		+ Fixed noisy -Winconsistent-missing-override compilation 
			warnings.
		+ Initialized some fields in constructors of modules before 
			OnLoad().
- Make building more verbose
- Partially fixes bsc#956254 - CVE-2014-9043

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  5 12:25:38 UTC 2015 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- Update to 1.6.1:

   of chansaver being loaded. 
 * Fixed query buffer size for users who have the default channel buffer size set to 0.
 * Fixed a startup failure when simple_away was loaded after awaynick.
 * Fixed channel matching commands, such as DETACH, to be case insensitive.
 * Specified the required compiler versions in the configure script.
 * Fixed a rare conflict of HTTP-Basic auth and cookies.
 * Hid local IP address from the 404 page.
 * Fixed a build failure for users who have -Werror=missing-declarations in their CXXFLAGS.
 * Fixed CXXFLAGS=-DVERSION_EXTRA="foo" which is used by some distros to package ZNC.
 * Fixed znc-buildmod on Cygwin.
 * Fixed CThreadPool destructor to handle spurious wakeups.
 * Fixed make distclean to remove zncconfig.h.
 * Improved the error message about --datadir.
 * Fixed a compilation warning when HAVE_LIBSSL is not defined.
 * Fixed 'comparision' typos in CString documentation.
 * Added a non-minified version of the jQuery source code to make Linux distributions
   (Debian) happy, even though the jQuery license does not require this.
 * chansaver:
    * Fixed random loading behavior due to an uninitialized member variable.
 * modpython:
    * Fixed access to CUser::GetUserClients() and CUser::GetAllClients().
 * sasl:
    * Improved help texts for the SET and REQUIREAUTH commands. (#875)
 * savebuff:
    * Fixed periodical writes on the disk when the module is loaded after startup. (#868)
 * webadmin:
    * Fixed module checkboxes not to claim that all networks/users have loaded 
      a module when there are no networks/users. (#872)
    * Added an explanation that ZNC was built without ICU support, when encoding 
      settings are disabled for that reason.
    * Improved the breadcrumbs.
    * Mentioned ExpandString in CTCP replies.
    * Added an explanation how to delete port which is used to access webadmin.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 15 18:28:43 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.6.0:
 * Switch versioning scheme to <major>.<minor>.<patch>.  Add settings
 * for which SSL/TLS protocols to use (SSLProtocols), 
   which ciphers to enable (SSLCiphers). By default TLSv1+ are enabled,
   SSLv2/3 are disabled. Default ciphers are what Mozilla advices:
   https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28default.29
 * Validate SSL certificates.  Allow clients to specify an ID as part of
 * username 
   (user[@identifier][/network]). Currently not used, but modules can
   use it.
 * Add alias module for ZNC-side command interception and processing.
 * Support character encodings with separate settings for networks, 
   and for clients. It replaces older charset module, which didn't work
   well with webadmin, log and other modules.
 * Support X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, used with new TrustedProxy
 * setting.  Add URIPrefix option for HTTP listeners, used with reverse
 * proxy.  Store query buffers per query the same way it's done for
 * channels, 
   add new option AutoClearQueryBuffer.
 * Add DisableChan command to *status, it was available only in 
   webadmin before.
 * Allow wildcards in arguments of Help commands of *status and 
   various modules.
 * Support IRCv3.2 batches, used for buffer playbacks.  Support IRCv3.2
 * self-message.  Remove awaynick module. It's considered bad etiquette.
 * Add JoinDelay setting, which allows a delay between 
   connection to server, and joining first channel. By default it joins
   immediately after connect.
 * Make Detach, EnableChan and DisableChan commands of *status 
   accept multiple channels.
 * znc-buildmod: Build output to the current working directory.  Wrap
 * long lines in tables (e.g. in Help or 
   ListAvailMods commands).
 * Support ECDHE if available in OpenSSL.  Report ZNC version more
 * consistently, add HideVersion 
   setting, which hides ZNC version from public.
 * Bump compiler requirements to support C++11. This means 
   GCC 4.7+, Clang 3.2+, SWIG 3.0.0+.
- Drop support for old distributions since they lack support for
  C++11

  ALL ZNC versions have a privilege escalation bug in webadmin.
  Users with a valid login are able to write arbitrary lines to
  your znc.conf which means they can make themselves admin, load
  the shell module or temporarily overwrite any files znc has
  access to (e.g. ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) via ISpoof. This bug can
  only be abused when ZNC is restarted or rehashed, so check your
  config before you do so! 

  This bug is fixed in znc 0.066. Update as soon as possible!

  for all the details see http://en.znc.in/wiki/ChangeLog/0.066
