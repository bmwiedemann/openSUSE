- update to 2.2.3:
  * This time we have two code fixes for potentially unsafe
    access, although we have not had any bug-reports about these.
  * It also contains several optimizations. Especially of note,
    inflate has been optimized on various instruction sets and
    also the generic C code has seen improvements, and we have
    improvements for arches where unaligned accesses are not
    possible (lacking instructions to handle unaligned access)
    and also improvements on big endian.
  * x86-64 AVX2: Inflate ~17.8% faster, Deflate unchanged. -4.6KB
    library size.
  * Aarch64: Inflate ~2.3% faster, Deflate unchanged. - 5.5KB
    library size.
  * We also took some time to do a comprehensive cleanup of the
    now misleading UNALIGNED_OK option and of all the "unaligned"
    functions. We have noticed that some distros have been
    disabling these, fearing they are using potentially unsafe
    unaligned pointers, but we already fixed that in 2.1.0-beta1.
    Since then, these "unaligned" settings/functions have been
    referring to using unaligned accesses in safe ways, like
    utilizing unaligned intrinsics or memcpy to fix alignment for
    example and selecting what safe method is optimal to the
    arch. So disabling that instead disabled several safe
    optimizations.
  * Because this was obviously misleading certain distros into
    disabling these optimizations, we have cleaned it up, removed
    a lot of unnecessary preprocessor checks, and made detection
    of optimal methods happen during compile instead of
    configure. As a bonus, this cleaned up a lot of code and also
    let us not compile in many extra variants of
    compare256/longest_match, saving about 8-10KB of library
    size.
  * PS: s390x is currently potentially unsafe, CI reports a
    failure on the MSAN test, this is pending investigation by
    IBM. See #1845.
  * Any Zlib-ng version on s390x built with VX-extensions enabled
    compiled using a buggy Clang version will be unsafe.
