- Update to version 1.10.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: anonymous-definition detects unnamed workflows and
      actions. Definitions without a name: field appear anonymously
      in the GitHub Actions UI, making them harder to distinguish
      (#937)
    - Auto-fix mode: zizmor now experimentally supports
      --fix=[MODE], which enables the brand new auto-fix mode. This
      mode can automatically fix a subset of zizmor's findings. For
      this experimental release, auto-fixes are available for
      findings from the following audits:
      - artipacked: zizmor will attempt to add persist-credentials:
        false to actions/checkout steps that do not already have
        it.
      - template-injection: zizmor will attempt to rewrite run:
        blocks containing ${{ foo.bar }} to use ${FOO_BAR} instead,
        and will add an appropriate env: block to set FOO_BAR to
        the expression's evaluation.
    Read more about the new auto-fix mode in the documentation.
    https://docs.zizmor.sh/usage/#auto-fixing-results
  * Enhancements
    - The artipacked audit now produces findings on composite
      action definitions, rather than just workflow definitions
      (#896)
    - The use-trusted-publishing audit now produces findings on
      composite action definitions, rather than just workflow
      definitions (#899)
    - The bot-conditions audit now detects more spoofable actor
      checks, including checks against well-known user IDs for bot
      accounts (#905)
    - The template-injection and other audits now produce more
      precise findings when analyzing env context accesses for
      static-ness (#911)
    - The template-injection audit now produces more precise
      findings when analyzing inputs context accesses (#919)
    - zizmor now produces more descriptive error messages when it
      fails to parse a workflow or action definition (#956)
    - The bot-conditions audit now returns precise spans for
      flagged actor checks, instead of flagging the entire if:
      value (#949)
    - The template-injection audit now returns precise spans for
      flagged contexts and expressions, instead of flagging the
      entire script block (#958)
    - The obfuscation audit now returns precise spans for flagged
      expressions (#969)
    - The obfuscation audit now detects computed indices (e.g.
      inputs.foo[inputs.bar]) as a potentially obfuscatory pattern
      (#969)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The template-injection audit no longer crashes when
      attempting to evaluate the static-ness of an environment
      context within a composite action uses: step (#887)
    - The bot-conditions audit now correctly analyzes index-style
      contexts, e.g. github['actor'] (#905)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse expressions that
      contained >= or <= (#916)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse expressions
      containing contexts with interstitial whitespace (#958)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 31 06:09:28 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  * New Features
    - zizmor now supports generating completions for Nushell (#838)
  * Enhancements
    - The template-injection audit has been rewritten, and is now
      significantly more precise and general over contexts supplied
      via GitHub's webhook payloads (i.e. github.event.*) (#745)
    - The template-injection audit now detects vulnerable template
      injections in more actions inputs, thanks to an integration
      with CodeQL's sink metadata (#849)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The insecure-commands now correctly detects different truthy
      values in ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS (#840)
    - The template-injection audit now correctly emits pedantic
      findings in a blanket manner, rather than filtering them
      based on the presence of other findings (#745)
    - CLI: Fixed a misleading error message when zizmor is used
      with a GitHub host other than github.com (#863)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates (#860)
    - chore(deps): bump astral-sh/setup-uv in the github-actions
      group (#859)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 21 04:29:53 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * Announcements
    - zizmor's website has changed! The new website is hosted at
      docs.zizmor.sh. The old website will redirect to the new one
      for a while, but users should update any old links in
      preparation for the v1.8.0 release, which will likely remove
      the redirects entirely (#769)
    - zizmor is now hosted under the @zizmorcore GitHub
      organization as zizmorcore/zizmor. The old repository at
      woodruffw/zizmor will redirect to the new one, but users
      should update any old links to limit confusion
  * New Features
    - zizmor now supports the ZIZMOR_CONFIG environment variable as
      an alternative to --config (#789)
  * Bug Fixes
    - zizmor now correctly handles index-style contexts in the
      template-injection audit (#800, #806)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): `cargo autoinherit` (#826)
    - chore(deps): bump zizmorcore/zizmor-action in the
      github-actions group (#822)
    - chore(deps): bump owo-colors from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 in the cargo
      group (#812)
    - chore(deps): run `cargo autoinherit` (#805)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 5 updates (#786)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 09 05:25:08 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- add shell completion subpackages
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  This release comes with four new audits: obfuscation,
  stale-action-refs, unsound-contains, and unpinned-images. It also
  includes several improvements to existing audits and zizmor's
  output formats and error reporting behavior.
  Additionally, this release comes with bugfixes for the SARIF
  output format as well as input collection in some edge cases when
  collecting from remote repositories.
  * New Features
    - New audit: The obfuscation audit detects obfuscatory patterns
      in GitHub Actions usages. These patterns are not themselves
      dangerous, but may indicate an attempt to obscure malicious
      behavior (#683)
    - New audit: The stale-action-refs pedantic audit detects
      pinned action references which don't point to a Git tag
      (#713)
    - New audit: The unsound-contains audit detects uses of the
      contains() function that can be bypassed (#577)
    - New audit: The unpinned-images audit detects uses of Docker
      images that are unpinned or pinned to :latest (#733)
    - zizmor now reports much clearer error messages when auditing
      fails due to an invalid workflow or action definition (#719)
    - zizmor now has a --strict-collection flag that turns skipped
      workflow or action definition warnings into errors. Passing
      this flag changes zizmor's behavior back to the default in
      v1.6.0 and earlier, which was to terminate the audit if any
      collected input could not be parsed (#734)
    - The forbidden-uses audit can now be configured with patterns
      that match exact uses: clauses, including refs. For example,
      exactly actions/checkout@v4 can now be explicitly allowed or
      forbidden, rather than every ref that matches
      actions/checkout (#750)
    - zizmor now has a --completions=<shell> flag that generates
      shell completion scripts (#765)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The SARIF output format now uses zizmor/{id} for rule IDs
      instead of bare IDs, reducing the chance of conflict or
      confusion with other tools (#710)
    - The SARIF output format now includes a rule name for each
      rule descriptor, which should improve rendering behavior in
      SARIF viewers like the VS Code SARIF Viewer extension (#710)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to collection actions
      defined within subdirectories of .github/workflows when
      collecting from a remote source (#731)
  * Upcoming Changes
    Starting with v1.8.0, zizmor will migrate from @woodruffw on
    GitHub to @zizmorcore. This should not cause any breakage as
    GitHub will handle redirects, but users who explicitly
    reference @woodruffw/zizmor should consider updating their
    references to @zizmorcore/zizmor once the migration occurs.
    See #758 for details.
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 3 updates
      (#747)
    - chore(deps): cargo update (#722)
    - chore(deps): bump insta from 1.42.2 to 1.43.0 in the cargo
      group (#702)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 2 updates (#686)
    - chore(deps): bump astral-sh/setup-uv in the github-actions
      group (#685)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 20 06:34:57 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: The forbidden-uses audit is a configurable audit
      that allows allow- or denylisting of entire orgs, repos, or
      specific action patterns. This audit must be configured; by
      default it has no effect (#664)
    - zizmor now supports --format=github as an output format. This
      format produces check annotations via GitHub workflow
      commands, e.g. ::warning and ::error. See the Output formats
      documentation for more information on annotations, including
      key limitations (#634)
    - The unpinned-uses audit has been completely rewritten, with
      two key changes:
       - The audit now has configurable policies that give users
         more control over the audit's behavior. In particular,
         users can now define policies that mirror their actual
         threat model, such as trusting their own GitHub
         organizations while leaving others untrusted.
       - The audit's default policy is more precise and
         conservative: official GitHub actions (e.g. those under
         actions/* and similar) are allowed to be pinned by branch
         or tag, but all other actions are required to be pinned by
         SHA. This is a change from the previous policy, which was
         to only flag completely unpinned actions by default.
  * Improvements
    - The SARIF output format now marks each rule as a "security"
      rule, which helps GitHub's presentation of the results (#631)
    - The template-injection audit is now performs dataflow
      analysis to determine whether contexts actually expand in an
      unsafe manner, making it significantly more accurate (#640)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now aware of jdx/mise-action
      (#645)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now significantly more accurate
      when analyzing workflows that use docker/setup-buildx-action
      (#644)
    - --format=json is now an alias for --format=json-v1, enabling
      future JSON formats. The policy for the --format=json alias
      is documented under Output formats - JSON (#657)
    - Configuration file loading is now stricter, and produces a
      more useful error message when the configuration file is
      invalid (#663)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.sha dangerous (#636)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      workflow_call triggers that specified inputs without the
      required field being present (#646)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      pull_request or pull_request_target triggers that specified
      types as a scalar value (#653)
    - Fixed a crash where zizmor would fail to generate correct
      concrete location spans for YAML inputs with comments inside
      block sequences (#660)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers github.job
      dangerous (#661)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork dangerous (#675)

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would over-eagerly parse invalid and
      commented-out expressions, resulting in spurious warnings

    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to honor # zizmor:
      ignore[rule] comments in unintuitive cases (#612)
    - Fixed a regression in zizmor's SARIF output format that
      caused suboptimal presentation of findings on GitHub (#621)

      as another spoofable actor check (#559)
  * Bug Fixes

      (#563)
  * Upcoming Changes
    - The next minor release of zizmor will be built with Rust
      2024. This should have no effect on most users, but may
      require users who build zizmor from source to update their
      Rust toolchain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 08 12:10:48 UTC 2025 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  This is a small quality and bugfix release. Thank you to
  everybody who helped by reporting and shaking out bugs from our
  first stable release!
  * Improved
    - The github-env audit now detects dangerous writes to
      GITHUB_PATH, is more precise, and can produce multiple
      findings per run block (#391)
  * Fixed
    - workflow_call.secrets keys with missing values are now parsed
      correctly (#388)
    - The cache-poisoning audit no longer incorrectly treats
      docker/build-push-action as a publishing workflow is push:
      false is explicitly set (#389)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.action_path to be a potentially dangerous expansion
      (#402)
    - The github-env audit no longer skips run: steps with
      non-trivial shell: stanzas (#403)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  3 15:07:00 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>
