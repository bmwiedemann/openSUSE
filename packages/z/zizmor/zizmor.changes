- add shell completion subpackages
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  This release comes with four new audits: obfuscation,
  stale-action-refs, unsound-contains, and unpinned-images. It also
  includes several improvements to existing audits and zizmor's
  output formats and error reporting behavior.
  Additionally, this release comes with bugfixes for the SARIF
  output format as well as input collection in some edge cases when
  collecting from remote repositories.
  * New Features
    - New audit: The obfuscation audit detects obfuscatory patterns
      in GitHub Actions usages. These patterns are not themselves
      dangerous, but may indicate an attempt to obscure malicious
      behavior (#683)
    - New audit: The stale-action-refs pedantic audit detects
      pinned action references which don't point to a Git tag
      (#713)
    - New audit: The unsound-contains audit detects uses of the
      contains() function that can be bypassed (#577)
    - New audit: The unpinned-images audit detects uses of Docker
      images that are unpinned or pinned to :latest (#733)
    - zizmor now reports much clearer error messages when auditing
      fails due to an invalid workflow or action definition (#719)
    - zizmor now has a --strict-collection flag that turns skipped
      workflow or action definition warnings into errors. Passing
      this flag changes zizmor's behavior back to the default in
      v1.6.0 and earlier, which was to terminate the audit if any
      collected input could not be parsed (#734)
    - The forbidden-uses audit can now be configured with patterns
      that match exact uses: clauses, including refs. For example,
      exactly actions/checkout@v4 can now be explicitly allowed or
      forbidden, rather than every ref that matches
      actions/checkout (#750)
    - zizmor now has a --completions=<shell> flag that generates
      shell completion scripts (#765)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The SARIF output format now uses zizmor/{id} for rule IDs
      instead of bare IDs, reducing the chance of conflict or
      confusion with other tools (#710)
    - The SARIF output format now includes a rule name for each
      rule descriptor, which should improve rendering behavior in
      SARIF viewers like the VS Code SARIF Viewer extension (#710)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to collection actions
      defined within subdirectories of .github/workflows when
      collecting from a remote source (#731)
  * Upcoming Changes
    Starting with v1.8.0, zizmor will migrate from @woodruffw on
    GitHub to @zizmorcore. This should not cause any breakage as
    GitHub will handle redirects, but users who explicitly
    reference @woodruffw/zizmor should consider updating their
    references to @zizmorcore/zizmor once the migration occurs.
    See #758 for details.
  * Dependencies

      (#747)
    - chore(deps): cargo update (#722)

Sun Apr 20 06:34:57 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: The forbidden-uses audit is a configurable audit
      that allows allow- or denylisting of entire orgs, repos, or
      specific action patterns. This audit must be configured; by
      default it has no effect (#664)
    - zizmor now supports --format=github as an output format. This
      format produces check annotations via GitHub workflow
      commands, e.g. ::warning and ::error. See the Output formats
      documentation for more information on annotations, including
      key limitations (#634)
    - The unpinned-uses audit has been completely rewritten, with
      two key changes:
       - The audit now has configurable policies that give users
         more control over the audit's behavior. In particular,
         users can now define policies that mirror their actual
         threat model, such as trusting their own GitHub
         organizations while leaving others untrusted.
       - The audit's default policy is more precise and
         conservative: official GitHub actions (e.g. those under
         actions/* and similar) are allowed to be pinned by branch
         or tag, but all other actions are required to be pinned by
         SHA. This is a change from the previous policy, which was
         to only flag completely unpinned actions by default.
  * Improvements
    - The SARIF output format now marks each rule as a "security"
      rule, which helps GitHub's presentation of the results (#631)
    - The template-injection audit is now performs dataflow
      analysis to determine whether contexts actually expand in an
      unsafe manner, making it significantly more accurate (#640)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now aware of jdx/mise-action
      (#645)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now significantly more accurate
      when analyzing workflows that use docker/setup-buildx-action
      (#644)
    - --format=json is now an alias for --format=json-v1, enabling
      future JSON formats. The policy for the --format=json alias
      is documented under Output formats - JSON (#657)
    - Configuration file loading is now stricter, and produces a
      more useful error message when the configuration file is
      invalid (#663)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.sha dangerous (#636)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      workflow_call triggers that specified inputs without the
      required field being present (#646)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      pull_request or pull_request_target triggers that specified
      types as a scalar value (#653)
    - Fixed a crash where zizmor would fail to generate correct
      concrete location spans for YAML inputs with comments inside
      block sequences (#660)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers github.job
      dangerous (#661)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork dangerous (#675)

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would over-eagerly parse invalid and
      commented-out expressions, resulting in spurious warnings

    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to honor # zizmor:
      ignore[rule] comments in unintuitive cases (#612)
    - Fixed a regression in zizmor's SARIF output format that
      caused suboptimal presentation of findings on GitHub (#621)

  * Bug Fixes

      2024. This should have no effect on most users, but may
      require users who build zizmor from source to update their
      Rust toolchain.

  everybody who helped by reporting and shaking out bugs from our
  first stable release!
  * Improved
    - The github-env audit now detects dangerous writes to
      GITHUB_PATH, is more precise, and can produce multiple
      findings per run block (#391)
  * Fixed
    - workflow_call.secrets keys with missing values are now parsed
      correctly (#388)
    - The cache-poisoning audit no longer incorrectly treats
      docker/build-push-action as a publishing workflow is push:
      false is explicitly set (#389)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.action_path to be a potentially dangerous expansion
      (#402)
    - The github-env audit no longer skips run: steps with
      non-trivial shell: stanzas (#403)
