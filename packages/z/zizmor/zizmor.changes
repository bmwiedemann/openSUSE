- Update to version 1.0.1:
  This is a small quality and bugfix release. Thank you to
  everybody who helped by reporting and shaking out bugs from our
  first stable release!
  * Improved
    - The github-env audit now detects dangerous writes to
      GITHUB_PATH, is more precise, and can produce multiple
      findings per run block (#391)
  * Fixed
    - workflow_call.secrets keys with missing values are now parsed
      correctly (#388)
    - The cache-poisoning audit no longer incorrectly treats
      docker/build-push-action as a publishing workflow is push:
      false is explicitly set (#389)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.action_path to be a potentially dangerous expansion
      (#402)
    - The github-env audit no longer skips run: steps with
      non-trivial shell: stanzas (#403)
