Wed Nov 26 06:23:09 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.17.0:
  * Enhancements
    - zizmor now produces a more useful error message when asked to
      collect only workflows from a remote input that contains no
      workflows (#1324)
    - zizmor now produces more precise severities on
      actions/checkout versions that have more misuse-resistant
      credentials persistence behavior (#1353)
    - Many thanks to @ManuelLerchnerQC for proposing and
      implementing this improvement!
    - The use-trusted-publishing audit now correctly detecting more
      "dry-run" patterns, making it significantly more accurate
      (#1357)
    - The obfuscation audit now detects usages of shell: cmd and
      similar, as the Windows CMD shell lacks a formal grammar and
      limits analysis of run: blocks in other audits (#1361)
  * Performance Improvements
    - zizmor's core has been refactored to be asynchronous, making
      online and I/O-heavy audits significantly faster. Typical
      user workloads should see speedups of 40% to 70% (#1314)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where auto-fixes would fail to preserve a
      document's final newline (#1323)
    - zizmor now uses the native (OS) TLS roots when performing
      HTTPS requests, improving compatibility with user
      environments that perform TLS interception (#1328)
    - The github-env audit now falls back to assuming bash-like
      shell syntax in run: blocks if it can't infer the shell being
      used (#1336)
    - The concurrency-limits audit now correctly detects job-level
      concurrency settings, in addition to workflow-level settings
      (#1338)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to collect workflows with
      names that overlapped with other input types (e.g. action.yml
      and dependabot.yml) when passed explicitly by path (#1345)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump github/codeql-action in the github-actions
      group (#1331)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates (#1358)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 8 updates (#1330)
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 2 updates
      (#1343)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 05 16:19:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.16.3:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would crash on an unexpected caching
      middleware state. zizmor will now exit with a controlled
      error instead (#1319)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 2 updates (#1316)
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 3 updates
      (#1317)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 02 06:58:40 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.16.2:
  * Enhancements
    - The concurrency-limits audit no longer flags explicit user
      concurrency overrides, e.g. cancel-in-progress: false (#1302)
    - zizmor now detects CI environments and specializes its panic
      handling accordingly, improving the quality of panic reports
      when running in CI (#1307)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would reject some Dependabot
      configuration files with logically unsound schedules (but
      that are accepted by GitHub regardless) (#1308)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 29 05:40:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.16.1:
  * Enhancements
    - zizmor now produces a more useful error message when asked to
      indirectly access a nonexistent or private repository via a
      uses: clause (without a sufficiently privileged GitHub token)
      (#1293)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 24 05:07:57 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.16.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: concurrency-limits detects insufficient
      concurrency limits in workflows (#1227)
    - Many thanks to @jwallwork23 for proposing and implementing
      this audit!
  * Performance Improvements
    - zizmor's online mode is now significantly (40% to over 95%)
      faster on common workloads, thanks to a combination of
      caching improvements and conversion of GitHub API requests
      into Git remote lookups (#1257)
    - Many thanks to @Bo98 for implementing these improvements!
  * Enhancements
    - When running in --fix mode and all fixes are successfully
      applied, zizmor now has similar exit code behavior as the
      --no-exit-codes and --format=sarif flags (#1242)
    - Many thanks to @cnaples79 for implementing this improvement!
    - The dependabot-cooldown audit now supports auto-fixes for
      many findings (#1229)
    - Many thanks to @mostafa for implementing this improvement!
    - The dependabot-execution audit now supports auto-fixes for
      many findings (#1229)
    - Many thanks to @mostafa for implementing this improvement!
    - zizmor now has limited, experimental support for handling
      inputs that contain YAML anchors (#1266)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 05:04:53 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.15.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse some Dependabot
      configuration files due to missing support for some schedule
      formats (#1247)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 14 05:07:07 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.15.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse Dependabot
      configuration files due to missing support for some package
      ecosystems (#1240)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 14 04:42:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.15.0:
  This release comes with support for auditing Dependabot
  configuration files! Like with composite action definition
  auditing (introduced in v1.0.0), Dependabot configuration
  auditing is enabled by default but can be disabled as part of
  input collection.
  To complement this new functionality, this release comes with two
  new audits: dependabot-execution and dependabot-cooldown.
  * New Features
    - New audit: dependabot-execution detects Dependabot
      configurations that allow insecure external code execution
      (#1220)
    - New audit: dependabot-cooldown detects Dependabot
      configurations that do not include cooldown settings, or that
      set an insufficient cooldown (#1223)
  * Performance Improvements
    - zizmor now uses jemalloc as its default allocator on non-MSVC
      targets, which should significantly improve performance for
      Linux and macOS users (#1200)
  * Enhancements
    - zizmor now unconditionally emits its version number to stderr
      on startup (#1199)
    - The ref-version-mismatch audit now supports auto-fixes for
      many findings (#1205)
    - The [impostor-commit] audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#1090)
    - zizmor is now more resilient to sporadic request failures
      when performing GitHub API requests (#1219)
    - --collect=dependabot is now supported as a collection option,
      allowing users to audit only Dependabot configuration files
      (#1215)
    - The --fix mode (introduced with v1.10.0) is now considered
      stable and no longer experimental (#1232)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail instead of analyzing
      single-file inputs that lacked an explicit parent path
      component, e.g. zizmor foo.yml instead of zizmor ./foo.yml
      (#1212)
  * Deprecations
    - The workflows-only and actions-only values for --collect are
      now deprecated. These values have been replaced with
      workflows and actions, respectively, which have the same
      behavior but can be composed together with other collection
      modes. The deprecated modes will be removed in a future
      release (#1228)
    - Until removal, using these values will emit a warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 30 05:23:31 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.14.2:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where the use-trusted-publishing audit would
      produce-false positive findings for some run: blocks that
      implicitly performed trusted publishing (#1191)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 28 15:02:36 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.14.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where the ref-version-mismatch would incorrectly
      show the wrong commit SHAs in its findings (#1183)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 28 14:51:11 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.14.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: ref-version-mismatch detects mismatches between
      hash-pinned action references and their version comments
      (#972)
  * Enhancements
    - zizmor no longer uses the "Unknown" severity or confidence
      levels for any findings. All findings previously categorized
      at these levels are now given a more meaningful level (#1164)
    - The use-trusted-publishing audit now detects various Trusted
      Publishing patterns for the npm ecosystem (#1161)
    - The unsound-condition audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#1089)
    - zizmor's error handling has been restructured, improving the
      quality of error messages and their associated suggestions
      (#1169)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where the cache-poisoning audit would fail to
      detect some cache usage variants in newer versions of
      actions/setup-node (#1152)
    - Fixed a bug where the obfuscation audit would incorrectly
      flag some subexpressions as constant-reducible when they were
      not (#1170)
  * Deprecations
    - The unknown values for --min-severity and --min-confidence
      are now deprecated. These values were already no-ops (and
      have been since introduction), and will be removed in a
      future release (#1164)
    - Until removal, using these values will emit a warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 14 11:54:23 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.13.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: undocumented-permissions detects explicit
      permission grants that lack an explanatory comment (#1131)
      Many thanks to @johnbillion for proposing and implementing
      this audit!
  * Enhancements
    - zizmor's configuration discovery behavior has been
      significantly refactored, making it easier to audit multiple
      independent inputs with their own configuration files (#1094)
      For most users, this change should cause no compatibility
      issues. For example, the following commands will continue to
      load the same configuration files as before:

        zizmor .
        zizmor .github/

      For other users, the behavior will change, but in a way
      that's intended to correct a long-standing bug with
      configuration discovery. In particular, the following
      commands will now behave differently:

        # OLD: would discover config in $CWD
        # NEW: will discover two different configs, one in each of the repos
        zizmor ./repoA ./repoB

      Separately from these changes, zizmor continues to support
      --config <path> and ZIZMOR_CONFIG with the exact same
      behavior as before.
      See Configuration - Discovery for a detailed explanation of
      the new behavior.
    - Audit rules can now be disabled entirely in zizmor's
      configuration. See rules..disable for details (#1132)
    - The obfuscation audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#1088)
  * Bug Fixes
    - zizmor now correctly honors --strict-collection when
      collecting from remote inputs. This also means that the
      default collection strictness has changed for remote inputs
      to match all other inputs (#1122)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would crash on certain UTF-8 inputs
      lacking an explicit final newline due to a bug in the
      annotate-snippets crate (#1136)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump github/codeql-action in the github-actions
      group (#1140)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 4 updates (#1141)
    - chore(docs): remove external links section, add crates.io
      link to footer (#1137)

    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 3 updates
      (#1129)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 2 updates (#1130)
    - chore(deps): bump tracing-subscriber from 0.3.19 to 0.3.20
      (#1121)
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 2 updates
      (#1112)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 5 updates (#1111)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 6 updates (#1097)
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 6 updates
      (#1096)

Mon Aug 18 13:04:34 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.12.1:
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where the cache-poisoning would incorrectly
      detect the opposite cases for cache enablement (#1081)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 18 12:58:27 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.12.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: unsound-condition detects if: conditions that
      inadvertently always evaluate to true (#1053)
  * Enhancements
    - The cache-poisoning audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#923)
    - The known-vulnerable-actions audit now supports auto-fixes
      for many findings (#1019)
    - zizmor is now stricter about parsing uses: clauses. In
      particular, zizmor will no longer accept uses: org/repo
      without a trailing @ref, as GitHub Actions itself does not
      accept this syntax (#1019)
    - The use-trusted-publishing audit now detects many more
      patterns, including cargo publish and other run: blocks that
      make use of publishing commands directly (#1042)
    - The insecure-commands audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#1045)
    - The template-injection audit now detects more action
      injection sinks (#1059)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where --fix would fail to preserve comments when
      modifying block-style YAML mappings (#995)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would crash when given a GitHub API
      token with leading or trailing whitespace (#1027)
    - Fixed a bug where template-injection findings in --fix mode
      would be incorrectly patched when referencing an env.*
      context (#1052)
    - Fixed a bug where template-injection findings in --fix mode
      would be patched with shell syntax that didn't match the
      step's actual shell (#1064)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 01 10:12:18 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.11.0:
  * New Features
    - zizmor now has experimental support for IDE/editor
      integrations via zizmor --lsp; see the IDE integration
      documentation for more information (#984)
  * Enhancements
    - The bot-conditions audit now supports auto-fixes for many
      findings (#921)
    - The bot-conditions audit now produces findings on triggers
      other than pull_request_target (#921)
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would crash when attempting to
      extract subfeatures from features containing non-ASCII
      codepoints (#989)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump the github-actions group with 3 updates
      (#990)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates (#991)
    - chore(deps): bump http-cache-reqwest to 0.16.0 (#982)
    - chore(deps): bump http-cache-reqwest to 0.15.2 (#980)
    - chore(docs): remove demo file, link to zizmor.sh (#978)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 05:16:04 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: anonymous-definition detects unnamed workflows and
      actions. Definitions without a name: field appear anonymously
      in the GitHub Actions UI, making them harder to distinguish
      (#937)
    - Auto-fix mode: zizmor now experimentally supports
      --fix=[MODE], which enables the brand new auto-fix mode. This
      mode can automatically fix a subset of zizmor's findings. For
      this experimental release, auto-fixes are available for
      findings from the following audits:
      - artipacked: zizmor will attempt to add persist-credentials:
        false to actions/checkout steps that do not already have
        it.
      - template-injection: zizmor will attempt to rewrite run:
        blocks containing ${{ foo.bar }} to use ${FOO_BAR} instead,
        and will add an appropriate env: block to set FOO_BAR to
        the expression's evaluation.
    Read more about the new auto-fix mode in the documentation.
    https://docs.zizmor.sh/usage/#auto-fixing-results
  * Enhancements
    - The artipacked audit now produces findings on composite
      action definitions, rather than just workflow definitions
      (#896)
    - The use-trusted-publishing audit now produces findings on
      composite action definitions, rather than just workflow
      definitions (#899)
    - The bot-conditions audit now detects more spoofable actor
      checks, including checks against well-known user IDs for bot
      accounts (#905)
    - The template-injection and other audits now produce more
      precise findings when analyzing env context accesses for
      static-ness (#911)
    - The template-injection audit now produces more precise
      findings when analyzing inputs context accesses (#919)
    - zizmor now produces more descriptive error messages when it
      fails to parse a workflow or action definition (#956)
    - The bot-conditions audit now returns precise spans for
      flagged actor checks, instead of flagging the entire if:
      value (#949)
    - The template-injection audit now returns precise spans for
      flagged contexts and expressions, instead of flagging the
      entire script block (#958)
    - The obfuscation audit now returns precise spans for flagged
      expressions (#969)
    - The obfuscation audit now detects computed indices (e.g.
      inputs.foo[inputs.bar]) as a potentially obfuscatory pattern
      (#969)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The template-injection audit no longer crashes when
      attempting to evaluate the static-ness of an environment
      context within a composite action uses: step (#887)
    - The bot-conditions audit now correctly analyzes index-style
      contexts, e.g. github['actor'] (#905)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse expressions that
      contained >= or <= (#916)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse expressions
      containing contexts with interstitial whitespace (#958)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 31 06:09:28 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  * New Features
    - zizmor now supports generating completions for Nushell (#838)
  * Enhancements
    - The template-injection audit has been rewritten, and is now
      significantly more precise and general over contexts supplied
      via GitHub's webhook payloads (i.e. github.event.*) (#745)
    - The template-injection audit now detects vulnerable template
      injections in more actions inputs, thanks to an integration
      with CodeQL's sink metadata (#849)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The insecure-commands now correctly detects different truthy
      values in ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS (#840)
    - The template-injection audit now correctly emits pedantic
      findings in a blanket manner, rather than filtering them
      based on the presence of other findings (#745)
    - CLI: Fixed a misleading error message when zizmor is used
      with a GitHub host other than github.com (#863)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates (#860)
    - chore(deps): bump astral-sh/setup-uv in the github-actions
      group (#859)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 21 04:29:53 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  * Announcements
    - zizmor's website has changed! The new website is hosted at
      docs.zizmor.sh. The old website will redirect to the new one
      for a while, but users should update any old links in
      preparation for the v1.8.0 release, which will likely remove
      the redirects entirely (#769)
    - zizmor is now hosted under the @zizmorcore GitHub
      organization as zizmorcore/zizmor. The old repository at
      woodruffw/zizmor will redirect to the new one, but users
      should update any old links to limit confusion
  * New Features
    - zizmor now supports the ZIZMOR_CONFIG environment variable as
      an alternative to --config (#789)
  * Bug Fixes
    - zizmor now correctly handles index-style contexts in the
      template-injection audit (#800, #806)
  * Dependencies
    - chore(deps): `cargo autoinherit` (#826)
    - chore(deps): bump zizmorcore/zizmor-action in the
      github-actions group (#822)
    - chore(deps): bump owo-colors from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 in the cargo
      group (#812)
    - chore(deps): run `cargo autoinherit` (#805)
    - chore(deps): bump the cargo group with 5 updates (#786)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 09 05:25:08 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- add shell completion subpackages
- Update to version 1.7.0:
  This release comes with four new audits: obfuscation,
  stale-action-refs, unsound-contains, and unpinned-images. It also
  includes several improvements to existing audits and zizmor's
  output formats and error reporting behavior.
  Additionally, this release comes with bugfixes for the SARIF
  output format as well as input collection in some edge cases when
  collecting from remote repositories.
  * New Features
    - New audit: The obfuscation audit detects obfuscatory patterns
      in GitHub Actions usages. These patterns are not themselves
      dangerous, but may indicate an attempt to obscure malicious
      behavior (#683)
    - New audit: The stale-action-refs pedantic audit detects
      pinned action references which don't point to a Git tag
      (#713)
    - New audit: The unsound-contains audit detects uses of the
      contains() function that can be bypassed (#577)
    - New audit: The unpinned-images audit detects uses of Docker
      images that are unpinned or pinned to :latest (#733)
    - zizmor now reports much clearer error messages when auditing
      fails due to an invalid workflow or action definition (#719)
    - zizmor now has a --strict-collection flag that turns skipped
      workflow or action definition warnings into errors. Passing
      this flag changes zizmor's behavior back to the default in
      v1.6.0 and earlier, which was to terminate the audit if any
      collected input could not be parsed (#734)
    - The forbidden-uses audit can now be configured with patterns
      that match exact uses: clauses, including refs. For example,
      exactly actions/checkout@v4 can now be explicitly allowed or
      forbidden, rather than every ref that matches
      actions/checkout (#750)
    - zizmor now has a --completions=<shell> flag that generates
      shell completion scripts (#765)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The SARIF output format now uses zizmor/{id} for rule IDs
      instead of bare IDs, reducing the chance of conflict or
      confusion with other tools (#710)
    - The SARIF output format now includes a rule name for each
      rule descriptor, which should improve rendering behavior in
      SARIF viewers like the VS Code SARIF Viewer extension (#710)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to collection actions
      defined within subdirectories of .github/workflows when
      collecting from a remote source (#731)
  * Upcoming Changes
    Starting with v1.8.0, zizmor will migrate from @woodruffw on
    GitHub to @zizmorcore. This should not cause any breakage as
    GitHub will handle redirects, but users who explicitly
    reference @woodruffw/zizmor should consider updating their
    references to @zizmorcore/zizmor once the migration occurs.
    See #758 for details.

Sun Apr 20 06:34:57 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * New Features
    - New audit: The forbidden-uses audit is a configurable audit
      that allows allow- or denylisting of entire orgs, repos, or
      specific action patterns. This audit must be configured; by
      default it has no effect (#664)
    - zizmor now supports --format=github as an output format. This
      format produces check annotations via GitHub workflow
      commands, e.g. ::warning and ::error. See the Output formats
      documentation for more information on annotations, including
      key limitations (#634)
    - The unpinned-uses audit has been completely rewritten, with
      two key changes:
       - The audit now has configurable policies that give users
         more control over the audit's behavior. In particular,
         users can now define policies that mirror their actual
         threat model, such as trusting their own GitHub
         organizations while leaving others untrusted.
       - The audit's default policy is more precise and
         conservative: official GitHub actions (e.g. those under
         actions/* and similar) are allowed to be pinned by branch
         or tag, but all other actions are required to be pinned by
         SHA. This is a change from the previous policy, which was
         to only flag completely unpinned actions by default.
  * Improvements
    - The SARIF output format now marks each rule as a "security"
      rule, which helps GitHub's presentation of the results (#631)
    - The template-injection audit is now performs dataflow
      analysis to determine whether contexts actually expand in an
      unsafe manner, making it significantly more accurate (#640)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now aware of jdx/mise-action
      (#645)
    - The cache-poisoning audit is now significantly more accurate
      when analyzing workflows that use docker/setup-buildx-action
      (#644)
    - --format=json is now an alias for --format=json-v1, enabling
      future JSON formats. The policy for the --format=json alias
      is documented under Output formats - JSON (#657)
    - Configuration file loading is now stricter, and produces a
      more useful error message when the configuration file is
      invalid (#663)
  * Bug Fixes
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.sha dangerous (#636)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      workflow_call triggers that specified inputs without the
      required field being present (#646)
    - Fixed a bug where zizmor would fail to parse workflows with
      pull_request or pull_request_target triggers that specified
      types as a scalar value (#653)
    - Fixed a crash where zizmor would fail to generate correct
      concrete location spans for YAML inputs with comments inside
      block sequences (#660)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers github.job
      dangerous (#661)
    - The template-injection audit no longer considers
      github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork dangerous (#675)

      ignore[rule] comments in unintuitive cases (#612)

      as another spoofable actor check (#559)
  * Bug Fixes

      (#563)
  * Upcoming Changes

      2024. This should have no effect on most users, but may
      require users who build zizmor from source to update their
      Rust toolchain.
