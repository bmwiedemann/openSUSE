%description
Zenity is a basic rewrite of gdialog, without the pain involved of
trying to figure out commandline parsing.  Zenity is zen-like; simple
and easy to use.

Zenity Dialogs: Calendar, Text Entry, Error, Informational, File
Selection, List, Progress, Question, Text Information, Warning and
Password.

Zenity is especially useful in scripts.
