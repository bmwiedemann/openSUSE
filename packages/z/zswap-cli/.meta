  <description>Zswap-cli is a command-line tool to control the zswap kernel module options on
the fly.

Zswap is a compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that are in the
process of being swapped out to disk and tries to compress them into a
RAM-based memory pool with dynamic allocation.

It trades CPU cycles for a significant performance boost since reading from a
compressed cache is much faster than reading from a swap device.</description>
