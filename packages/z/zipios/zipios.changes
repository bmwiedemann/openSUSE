- Update to version 2.3.2:
  * Bugs:
    + As suggested, use argv[2] when ent is nullptr (#42).
    + Fixed an issue with empty files to avoid error.
    + Missed adding the signature to the last entry.
    + Fixed two operator = () which improperly returned a const &.
    + Really auto-init m_zs.
    + Require that chdir() & truncate() return 0.
    + Bumped the version to 2.3 since the CRC32 computation bug was
      a pretty major fix (#38).
    + Correctly clear the m_checked flag on a change of the FilePath.
    + Fixed a Logical OR (|| instead of |).
    + Fixed two ISO-8851-1 characters.
    + Removed the inverted question mark.
    + Fixed path to BUILD folder in ./mk script.
  * New Features / Enhancements
    + Extended public interface.
    + Added support for an std::istream when creating a ZipFile
      object.
    + Added support for a StreamEntry when creating a zip file.
    + Replaced new ... with std::make_shared<>() where possible.
    + Updated CMakeLists.txt (clean ups).
    + Removed the -std=c++17 option. I don't need it and it's
      better without.
    + Implemented the big endian version of the
      dosdatetime_convert_t union.
    + Added casts for signed/unsigned comparisons.
    + Added a function to compute CRC32 of local disk files.
    + Added the clear() and empty() functions to the FilePath class.
    + Use clear() instead of setting string to "".
    + Added support for -v (verbose) to the ./mk script.
  * Documentation
    + Made the search of the Doxygen tools quieter by default.
    + Added a note about the root branch renaming. It is "main" now.
    + Added a few comments (missing docs).
    + Ran ispell to fix the docs a bit.
    + Corrected links in README.md (especially use the https protocol)
    + Changed the o umlaut to use UTF-8.
  * Packaging (included Debian)
    + Changed Debian release name to bionic and then jammy.
    + Updated the compat to v10.
    + Removing the multiarch-support dependency. It's only for
      amd64 at the moment.
    + Remove dependency on old catch package. We now use
      snapcatch2.
  * Tests
    + Upgraded the tests to catch2 v3.x.
    + Renamed the tests catch_<name>.cpp.
    + Renamed the file with the main() function catch_main.cpp/hpp.
    + Enhanced the test of the project version.
    + Make use of the --tmp-path and --source-path of the new
      snapcatch2 main().
    + Fixed test verifying DOS timestamps with +/- 1 hour (ugly but
      it works).
    + Removed the '&' in a CATCH_REQUIRE_THROWS_AS().
    + Fixed the include and library linking for the tests.
    + Added CATCH_END_SECTION() everywhere.
    + Prepended CATCH_... to all the macros so they compile with
      the newer version.
    + Properly indent the test CMakeLists.txt file.
    + Removed the cmake_minimum_required(). It's only required in
      the main CMakeLists.txt.
    + Verify the versions in the tests to be more sure I catch
      discrepancies.
    + Added a new test to make sure issue #38 was fixed.
    + Made tests delete files upfront too (in case it breaks part
      way in a previous run).
* Add fix_cstdint_include.patch

Tue Aug  8 17:44:04 UTC 2023 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 2.2.6:
  * Applied a few fixes to avoid some warnings when compiling in
    32 bits.
  * Commented out tests which verify dates outside of the 32 bit
    range (i.e. time_t is a 32 bit signed integer on a 32 bit OS).
  * Fixed the docs Bugs and Links and Issue Sections.
  * Removed some ++ from Zipios because the name changed and we
    removed the ++.
  * Applied most of pull request 30, added the metainfo.xml file.
  * Applied https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios/pull/34 (remove path
    from all filenames)
- Update to version 2.2.5:
  * Applied https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios/pull/31
    (corrections to comments as in spelling/grammar errors)
- Update to version 2.2.4:
  * Applied fix to some tests so they compile with g++ 8.3.x
- Update to version 2.2.3:
  * Added in=C++ to the MAPPING_EXTENSION.
  * Updated the doxy file to 1.8.11.
  * Removed one more UTF-8 emdash character.
  * Made a few changes in link with the website and CVE-2019-13453
    in the old zipios library.
  * Added a favicon for the website.
- Update to version 2.2.2:
  * Fixed the FindCatch.cmake, the REQUIRED was not properly tested.
- Update to version 2.2.1:
  * Fixed the "DirectoryEntry for a valid directory" test as the
    FileEntry object saves a Unix timestamp as a time_t and
    therefore with a full range precision. (#29)
- Update build dependencies
- Clean up spec file
- Drop obsolete zipios-use_PIE.patch
- Split API documentation from devel package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 18 12:57:50 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 2.2.0
  * As per [issue #28 on
    Github](https://github.com/Zipios/Zipios/issues/28),
    there was a discrepancy in licenses because of the dostime.c
    and dostime.h files.
    These two files were removed and replaced by a DOSDateTime
    class instead.
    It's all C++ and uses a structure with field to convert the
    data as required.
  * The license was also updated and copyright file fixed up to
    match the newer version.

- Renamed package files to match package name

- Added zipios-docpath.patch and zipios-use_PIE.patch

- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Mar 20 21:51:09 UTC 2012 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Added a patch (ptrdiff.patch) to fix compilation error "error: 'ptrdiff_t'
  does not name a type" (taken from Debian).
- Spec file updates:
  * Renamed spec file from libzipios0 to zipios++ (to be the same as the
    package name).
  * Renamed libzipios0-devel to zipios++-devel and added the necessary
    Provides/Obsoletes entries for libzipios0-devel.
  * Changes based on spec-cleaner run.
  * Changed License: to LGPL-2.1+.
  * Disabled compilation of static library.
