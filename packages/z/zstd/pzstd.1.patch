 \fBzstd\fR offers \fIdictionary\fR compression, which greatly improves efficiency on small files and messages\. It\'s possible to train \fBzstd\fR with a set of samples, the result of which is saved into a file called a \fBdictionary\fR\. Then during compression and decompression, reference the same dictionary, using command \fB\-D dictionaryFileName\fR\. Compression of small files similar to the sample set will be greatly improved\.
