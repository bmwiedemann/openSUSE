 .SS "Restricted usage of Environment Variables"
 Using environment variables to set parameters has security implications\. Therefore, this avenue is intentionally restricted\. Only \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR is supported currently, for setting compression level\. \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR can be used to set the level between 1 and 19 (the "normal" range)\. If the value of \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR is not a valid integer, it will be ignored with a warning message\. \fBZSTD_CLEVEL\fR just replaces the default compression level (\fB3\fR)\. It can be overridden by corresponding command line arguments\.

 .SH "DICTIONARY BUILDER"
 \fBzstd\fR offers \fIdictionary\fR compression, which greatly improves efficiency on small files and messages\. It\'s possible to train \fBzstd\fR with a set of samples, the result of which is saved into a file called a \fBdictionary\fR\. Then during compression and decompression, reference the same dictionary, using command \fB\-D dictionaryFileName\fR\. Compression of small files similar to the sample set will be greatly improved\.
