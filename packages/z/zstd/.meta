  <title>Zstandard compression tools</title>
  <description>Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm,
targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level compression ratio.

Zstd can also offer stronger compression ratios at the cost of compression speed. Speed vs Compression trade-off is configurable by small increments. Decompression speed is preserved and remains roughly the same at all settings, a property shared by most LZ compression algorithms, such as zlib or lzma.</description>
