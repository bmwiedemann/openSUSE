%description
Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a lossless compression algorithm. Speed
vs. compression trade-off is configurable in small increments.
Decompression speed is preserved and remains roughly the same at all
settings, a property shared by most LZ compression algorithms, such
as zlib or lzma.

At roughly the same ratio, zstd (v1.4.0) achieves ~870%% faster
compression than gzip. For roughly the same time, zstd achives a
~12%% better ratio than gzip. LZMA outperforms zstd by ~10%% faster
compression for same ratio, or ~1â€“4%% size reduction for same time.
