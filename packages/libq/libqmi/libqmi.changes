Wed Oct  7 19:09:15 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- update to 1.26.6:
 * libqmi-glib:
   + New TLV read APIs added in "NAS Get Cell Location Info" so
     that BCD encoded PLMN strings are read as arrays instead of
     as UTF-8 validated strings.
   + Allow TAB characters as printable in strings.
 * qmicli:
   + report EcIo, RSRP and phase for 5GNR in "NAS Get TX/RX Info".
 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 26 19:20:02 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.26.4:
 * Added new message collections support, so that users can select which
   messages to include in the built library during configure with the
   --enable-collection option. Three predefined sets are given:
   ** minimal: the bare minimum messages required to control connectivity.
   ** basic: all messages and indications that ModemManager requires.
   ** full: all supported messages and indications.
   Users can install custom collections under data/ and reference them in
   the same way as the predefined sets. E.g. installing a new
   data/qmi-collection-custom.json set can be enabled during configure with
   --enable-collection=custom.
 * Added new GObject Introspection support in the library
 * Implemented new QRTR backend support, disabled by default. This new backend
   allows to perform QMI operations on systems with the Qualcomm IPC router
 * Added 5GNR radio access technology support, with new enum values in both the
   DMS and NAS services.
 * New services:
   ** New 'GMS' (Telit General Modem Service) service, for now just implementing
      basic test get/set value commands.
   ** New 'DSD' (Data System Determination) service, implementing methods to get
      and set default bearer APN settings.
 * New request/response/indications:
   ** dms: implement "Get MAC Address" request/response.
   ** dms: renamed "Dell Get Firmware Version" to "Foxconn Get Firmware Version"
      as the command applies not only to the Dell-branded variant, but also to
      the generic Foxconn-branded models. The old APIs are kept available but
      flagged as deprecated.
   ** loc: implement "Set NMEA Types" request/response.
   ** loc: implement "Get NMEA Types" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Switch Slot" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Get Slot Status" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Slot Status" indication.
   ** voice: implement "Indication Register" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Answer USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Cancel USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Release USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "USSD" indication.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD No Wait" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD No Wait" indication.
 * New TLVs supported in existing messages:
   ** nas: added 'Extended List' and 'Bandwidth List' in "Get RF Band
      Information".
   ** wda: added 'Endpoint Info' in "Get Data Format".

    The library will no longer prevent a given message from being
    sent to the module based on the version information kept in
    the message database.
  * docs: fixed Since tags in UIM messages using the fixed
    "Session" TLV introduced in 1.22.

      even if indications are required to complete the command
      (e.g. most PDC and LOC commands).
  + qmi-network: Avoid creating invalid --wds-start-network when
    APN is not set.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.

  + libqmi-glib:
    - Prefer realpath() to canonicalize_file_name().
    - Avoid signals sent to the qmi-proxy process.
  + qmi-firmware-update: Support USB3->USB2 mode changes during
    upgrade.

  + libqmi:
    - Implemented support for vendor-specific commands through a
      new qmi_device_command_full() operation and a new
      QmiMessageContext type.
    - New 'QMI_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_AUTO' flag in qmi_device_open()
      which allows automatic detection of the underlying protocol
      in a cdc-wdm device (either QMI or MBIM) and transparently
      uses it based on that.
    - New qmi_device_close_async() operation, which allows closing
      a QmiDevice asynchronously.
    - Fixed QmiWmsCdmaCauseCode enum names, and provided a
      compatibility layer keeping the old names to avoid breaking
      API.
  + New services: pdc: new "PDC" (persistent device configuration)
    service, which among other things, allows configuring the HP
    lt4120.
  + New TLVs supported in existing messages: wda: updated "Set Data
    Format" request to allow specifying endpoint type and interface
    number.
  + qmi-firmware-update: This is a completely new tool that allows
    upgrading firmware in (at least) Sierra Wireless devices with
    MDM9200, MDM9x15 or MDM9x30 chipsets. Run the tool with --help
    and --help-examples to get more information on how to use it.
  + qmicli:
    - The CLI no longer requires the '--device-open-mbim' explicit
      option when opening QMI capable MBIM devices, the automatic
      detection of QMI over MBIM is enabled by default.
    - New '--device-open-qmi' option to disable the automatic
      detection of protocol and force using QMI.
    - If running in MBIM mode, enable MBIM logs and traces.
    - By default the QmiDevice will be closed before exiting, e.g.
      so that the MBIM session is also closed.
  + docs:
    - Updated the documentation so that each QMI message and each
      TLV specifies in which libqmi version it was introduced,
      using "since:" tags in the QMI message databases.
    - Added indices for new symbols introduced in the major libqmi
      releases, as well as for symbols flagged as deprecated.
- Add pkgconfig(gudev-1.0) BuildRequires: New optional dependency.

Mon Jul 11 19:22:33 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to version 1.16.0
  + New --enable-mbim-qmux option during configure, which enables
  the support for using an MBIM control device as transport for the 
  QMI messages, only if the MBIM device implements the "QMI
  service". This setting is automatically enabled if libmbim >=
  1.14.0 is found in the system, and can be explicitly disabled 
  with --disable-mbim-qmux.
  + New request/responses:
    - nas: new "Get LTE Cphy CA Info" request/response.
    - nas: new "Force Network Search" request/response.
  + qmi-network:
    - Fixed several bashisms.
  + Added compatibility symbols for some API breaks introduced in

      current was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_\
      programming_code_input_get_current_code.
    - qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_new
      was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_\
      input_get_new_code.
    - qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_\
      current was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_\
      programming_code_input_set_current_code.
    - qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_new
      was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_\
      input_set_new_code.
    - QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_VAILABLE was renamed to
      QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE.

    - Fixed --dms-get-band-capabilities output on 32-bit platforms.
    - Fixed license text of the voice service implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  9 11:03:29 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.14.2:
  + Added compatibility symbols for some API breaks introduced in
    1.14.0:
  + This release will recover the old names and still keep the new
    ones around for compatibility.
  + libqmi-glib: Fixed QMI_DMS_BAND_CAPABILITY_BC_15 enum value so
    that it isn't treated as a negative value. This may actually be
    treated as a minor ABI break.
  + qmicli: Fixed --dms-get-band-capabilities output on 32-bit
    platforms.
  + Fixed license text of the voice service implementation.
- Changes from version 1.14.0:
  + This version comes with a couple of small API breaks:
  + ECIO value type in "NAS Event Report Indication" is given as
    unsigned.
  + ECIO value in ECIO List array type in "NAS Get Signal Strenght"
    is given as unsigned.
  + QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE enum name was fixed.
  + The library and tools now support working with modems which
    only implement raw IP (i.e. no ethernet headers) in the WWAN
    interface. This relies on the kernel to expose
    '/sys/class/net/<WWAN>/qmi/raw_ip' sysfs files for each WWAN
    network interface (available since Linux 4.5-rc1).
  + New initial support for the 'Voice' service.
  + The qmicli tool has been updated with several new
    functionalities.
  + The qmi-network helper script has been updated with several new
    features.
  + Added command completion support in qmicli.
  + Other bugfixes and minor improvements.

Sun Feb  1 09:13:26 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.12.2:
  + Fix bug reading sized-guints, which was making --dms-get-time
    segfault.
  + Fix compilation warnings in 32 bit systems.
  + Add missing services in get_printable() and
    get_version_introduced().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 28 15:58:56 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.12.0:
  + New `--enable-qmi-username' option during configure, which
    allows specifying which will be the user owning the
    /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all QMI modems (udev rules
    are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
    used, the qmi-proxy will only allow connections from processes
    running by the specified user or by the root user.
  + New TLV builder and reader API, which is much more strict and
    secure. The autogenerated code will no longer first check if
    there is enough space available in the output message buffer
    and then write the parsed contents. Instead, the new reader API
    will be used, which is able to check for the expected size
    directly before writing in the buffer.
  + New unit tests to check messages built by the libqmi-glib
    library, using a fake proxy. In order to support these, the
    QmiDevice has two new properties:
    - "device-no-file-check": instructs the QmiDevice to avoid
      checking if the specified file exists.
    - "device-proxy-path": specifies a custom abstract socket path
      for the QmiProxy, to avoid using the default one.
  + New A-GPS support in the PDS service:
    - pds: added "Get Default Tracking Session" request/response.
    - pds: added "Set Default Tracking Session" request/response.
    - pds: added "Get AGPS Config" request/response.
    - pds: added "Set AGPS Config" request/response.
  + Updated minumum available version of several messages:
    - dms: "UIM Get IMSI" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already.
    - dms: "UIM Get ICCID" seems to be available in DMS 1.1
      already.
  + Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
    - Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
    - Fix bashisms in the qmi-network script.
    - Fix qmi_message_set_transaction_id() in non-CTL messages.
    - Fix segfault due to race condition in the QmiProxy.
    - Fixed printing contents of structs with fixed sized strings
      in qmi-codegen.
- Drop libqmi-1.10.2-fix-bashisms.patch: fixed upstream.
