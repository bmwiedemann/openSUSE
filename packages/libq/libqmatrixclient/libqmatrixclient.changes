Thu Apr 18 14:10:46 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.5.1.2
  - (#316) Expired tokens no more bring IncorrectRequestError 
    instead of ContentAccessError; consequently, 
    Connection::logout() ignores ContentAccessErrors so expired 
    tokens don't leave the library in a "can't go-in, can't go out" 
    state.
  - Jobs abandoned due to Connection being deleted no more cause 
    crashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 12:25:50 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.5.1.1
  This release fixes a bug that makes 0.5.1 not being "new enough" 
  for Quaternion 0.0.9.4, and another bug that made user showing up 
  multiple times in the user list of Quaternion after renaming. 
  Otherwise it's the same as version 0.5.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  5 07:46:12 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.5.1
  - Fix (#303): linkification doesn't break on peculiar links.
  - Fix (#310 and 27c2989): quirks in rendering room display names 
    have been ironed out.
  - Fix: Tighter validations of URLs coming with file events 
    (too relaxed validations were causing the library to 
    assert-crash on, e.g., encrypted attachments).
  - Enhancement (#305): rooms created as direct chats are now 
    automatically marked as m.direct for invited as well as 
    inviting users.
  - Enhancement (#306): Room::canSwitchVersions() returns false on 
    rooms already upgraded (you still can disregard and call 
    Room::switchVersion() but you better think twice 
    - see matrix-org/matrix-doc#1937).
  - Enhancement: Room::postFile() now first starts file upload and 
    then places a pending event (neatly packed with file transfer 
    information), rather than the other way around. Unless you do 
    weird things with the library's API, you shouldn't notice.
  - Enhancement: LRO/RLO Unicode markers are now stripped from 
    display names, to curtail abuse of those.
  - Feature: Connection::domain() to save client authors from 
    taking the domain from user MXID.

Wed Apr  3 09:01:26 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.5.0.2
  * Another bugfix release in 0.5.x branch, fixing issues with 
    sending read receipts and redactions in v3 rooms (#300).

- Changes from 0.5.0.1
  * This version fixes too stringent checks in debug builds that 
    led to assertion crashes upon encounter with upgraded rooms.

- Changes from 0.5
  As usual for 0.x versions, 0.5 breaks API compatibility with 
  previous versions; 0.4-compatible clients may or may not need 
  changes in order to compile with version 0.5. As usual, see diffs
  in header files to track the changes and update the client code 
  accordingly; these release notes highlight most prominent API 
  changes.

  Micro-versions in 0.5.y will maintain the API and ABI. 
  Version 0.6 will break either API or ABI or both.

  Over 200 commits. So see for changelog

- Update to 0.4.2.1:
  * No more treat fake state events (that don't have
    state_key, even if they have state-related type, e.g., m.room.topic)
    as state events, turning them into unknown events instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 0.2.1
  - Fixed an occasional crash due to dangling callbacks in avatar 
    fetching code
  - Fixed unreliable network error handling leading to sync loop 
    getting "unlooped" when server is temporarily unavailable
  - Fixed a regression leading to bridge postfixes not being 
    removed from user display names
  - Fixed a regression manifesting in dysfunctional user name 
    disambiguation
  - Added User::rawName() to get a user name together with its 
    bridge postfix
