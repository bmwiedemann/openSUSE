  <title>QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects</title>
  <description>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
It can represent integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of value,
and a collection of name/value pairs. QJson is a qt-based library that maps
JSON data to QVariant objects. JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList
instances, while JSON's objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.</description>
