- Update to version 0.9.2:
  + One year of bugfixing and improvements. Please see NEWS for
    a full list of changes.
- Add -DLUA_COMPAT_MODULE to CFLAGS, allowing to use compatibility
  features of LUA 5.1, using LUA 5.2.
- Move the library to libquvi. NOTE: the current library is a .so
  file only and does not have version information. This is an
  intentional behavior from upstream and accepted during the 0.9
  release cycle. The versions are ABI incompatible to each other.
  See http://repo.or.cz/w/libquvi.git/commit/20b1e for a rationale.
- Add libquvi-rpmlintrc: we need to filter out the library being
  in the main package now. rpmlintrc does not know correcly about
  this case, and considering that this is a temporary situation
  during the 0.9 cycle, it's also not worthy to address this in
  rpmlintrc code.

  * FIX: Lua 5.2: Use luaL_newstate instead (#89) [6de7322]
  * FIX: Make verify c/b check against correct option [0c4ff3b]
  * FIX: Use dirname(3) properly [b2f1621]

Mon Jan 23 09:26:42 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Always build against lua-devel: lua 5.2 on 12.2/Factory doesn't
  seem to be an issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 10 13:13:14 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- New package (version 0.4.0).
- This is based on the quvi 0.2.19 package: quvi got split in three
  modules upstream for 0.4.x.
