  <title>Accessibilty tools helper library, used e.g. by screen readers</title>
  <description>This library is used when writing accessibility clients such as screen readers.
It comes with some examples demonstrating the API. These small helpers may be
useful when testing accessibility. One of them writes all accessibiliy
interfaces an application provides as text output. The other, more advanced
application shows a tree of objects and allows some interaction and
exploration.
