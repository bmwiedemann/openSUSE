  <title>run-time tuning of process binding policies made easy</title>
  <description>libquo, a high-level, easy to use programming interface tailored specifically 
for MPI/MPI+X codes that may benefit from evolving process binding policies
during their execution. QUO allows for arbitrary process binding policies to 
be enacted and reverted during the execution of an MPI/MPI+X application as 
different computational phases are entered and exited, respectively.</description>
