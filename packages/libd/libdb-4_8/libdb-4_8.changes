-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 22 12:08:25 UTC 2010 - rhafer@novell.com

- Updated to db-4.8.30. Important changes since 4.7:
  * Improved scalability and throughput when using BTree databases
    especially when running with multiple threads that equal or
    exceed the number of available CPUs.
  * Berkeley DB has added database partitioning. BTree or Hash
    databases may now be partitioned across multiple directories.
    Partitioned databases can be used to increase concurrency and to
    improve performance by spreading access across disk subsystems.
  * Berkeley DB now supports bulk insertion and deletion of data.
    Similar to the bulk get interface, the bulk put and bulk delete
    allow the developer to populate a buffer of key-value pairs and
    then pass it to the BDB library with a single API call.
  * Berkeley DB now supports compression when using BTree.
  * Berkeley DB introduces a new utility named db_sql which replaces
    db_codegen. Similar to db_codegen, db_sql accepts an input file
    with DDL statements and generates a Berkeley DB application
    using the C API that creates and performs CRUD operations on
    the defined tables. The developer can then use that code as a
    basis for further application development.
  * The Replication Manager now supports shared access to the Master
    database environment from multiple processes. In earlier
    versions, multiple process support on the Master required use
    of the Base Replication API.
  * Foreign Key Support has been added to Berkeley DB.
  * for a more detailed changelog see the changelog_4_8.html file
    in db-doc package.
- Removed db-utils-doc subpackage the utils documentation is now
  integrated with the API documentation.

libdb-4_5
libdb-4_5
- update to version 4.5:

Database or Log File On-Disk Format Changes:

      None

New Features:

   1. A new event style notification.
   2. Multi-Version Concurrency Control for the Btree/Recno
   access methods.
   3. A new replication framework with a default TCP/IP setup.
   4. A new port to the BREW platform (a cell phone OS),  not
   fully supported but ready for testing.
   5. Several enhancements to the Java Collections API including
   the implementation of the size() method.
   6. Online replication upgrades for high availability replicated
   24/7 systems.

Database Environment Changes:

   1. Update the DB_ENV->failchk method to garbage collect
   per-process mutexes stranded after unexpected process
   failure. [#13964]
   2. Fix a bug that could cause memory used to track threads
   for DB_ENV->failchk to not be reused when a thread no longer
   exists. [#14425]
   3. Add set_event_notify behavior as part of new event
   notification in Berkeley DB. [#14534]
   4. Fix a bug so that we no longer panic on DB_ENV->close()
   if a previous environment close failed to log. This condition
   will now return an error. [#14693]

Concurrent Data Store Changes:

   1. Fix a bug where renaming a subdatabase in a Concurrent
   Data Store environment could fail. [#14185]

General Access Method Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could leave extra unallocated pages at the
   end of a database file. [#14031]
   2. Optimize secondary updates when overwriting primary
   records. [#14075]
   3. Fix a bug to prevent a trap when creating a named in-memory
   database and there are already temporary files open. [#14133]
   4. Fix a bug which caused a trap if the key parameter to
   DBC->c_get was omitted with DB_CURRENT. [#14143]
   5. Fix a bug with secondary cursors when the secondary has
   off-page duplicates. This bug resulted in incorrect primary
   data being returned. [#14240]
   6. Fix a bug that would not properly upgrade database files
   from releases 3.2.9 (and earlier) to releases 4.0 (and
   greater). [#14461]
   7. Fix a bug that could cause a DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED get through
   a secondary index to return DB_SECONDARY_CORRUPT. [#14487]
   8. Fix a bug so that non-transactional cursor updates of a
   transactional database will generate an error. [#14519]
   9. Add a message when the system panics due to a page in the
   wrong state at its time of allocation. [#14527]

Btree Access Method Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could cause a diagnostic assertion by setting
   the deleted bit on a record in an internal node. [#13944]
   2. Fix 3 problems in BTREE compaction: [#14238]
         1. When deleting a page don't check the next key in
         the parent if we are going to delete the parent too.
         2. Need to check that the tree has not collapsed between
         dropping a read lock and getting the write lock. If it
         has collapsed we will fetch the root of the tree.
         3. Fix a case where we fail to lock the next page before
         reading it.
   3. Fix a bug that could cause the compaction of a Btree with
   sorted duplicates to fail when attempting to compact an off
   page duplicate tree if a key could not fit in an internal
   node. [#14771]
   4. Fix a bug that causes a loop if an empty Btree was
   compacted. [#14493]

Hash Access Method Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could cause corruption in queue extent
   files if multiple processes tried to open the same extent at
   the same time. [#14438]

Queue Access Method Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that caused locks not maintained where queue
   records were read but not present in the queue at the end of
   a transaction, therefore violating serializability. [#13719]

Recno Access Method Changes:

      None

C++-specific API Changes:

   1. C++ applications that check could the error code in
   exceptions should note that DbMemoryException has been changed
   to have the error code DB_BUFFER_SMALL rather than ENOMEM, to
   match the error returned by the C API.  DbMemoryException will
   be thrown when a Dbt is too small to contain data returned
   by Berkeley DB.  When a call to malloc fails, or some other
   resource is exhausted, a plain DbException will be thrown
   with error code set to ENOMEM. [#13939]

Java-specific API Changes:

   1. Database.verify may now be called. This method is now
   static and takes a DatabaseConfig parameter. [#13971]
   2. Add DB_ENV->{fileid_reset, lsn_reset} to the public
   API. [#14076]

Java collections and bind API Changes:

   1. The com.sleepycat.collections package is now fully
   compatible with the Java Collections framework. [#14732]

Tcl-specific API Changes:

      None

RPC-specific Client/Server Changes:

      None

Replication Changes:

   1. Fix a bug so that internal init will remove client databases
   at the start of internal init. [#14147]
   2. Fix a bug in replication internal init so that using
   data_dir will be handled correctly.  Make internal
   init resilient to multiple data_dir calls with the same
   directory. [#14489]
   3. Fix a bug in the 4.2 sync-up algorithm that could result
   in no open files. [#14552]
   4. Fix a bug where a PERM bulk buffer could have a zero LSN
   passed to the application callback. [#14675]
   5. Change names of some existing replication API methods
   as described in "Replication Method Naming" page of the
   "Upgrading Berkeley DB Applications to Release 4.5" section
   of Berkeley DB Reference Guide. [#14723]
   6. Fix a bug which could cause an election to succeed only
   after waiting for the timeout to expire, even when all sites
   responded in a timely manner. The bug was most easily visible
   in an election between 2 sites. [#14752]

XA Resource Manager Changes:

      None

Locking Subsystem Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could cause a writer to hang if
   readuncommitted is enabled and it tries to reacquire a write
   lock. [#14919]

Logging Subsystem Changes:

   1. Fix a bug so that log headers are now included in
   the check sum.  This avoids a possible race in doing hot
   backups. [#11636].
   2. Fix a bug where recovery fails if there is no disk space
   for the forced checkpoint that occurs at the end of processing
   the log. [#13986]
   3. Fix a bug which could cause a page to be missing from
   the end of a database file if the page at the end of the
   file was freed while it contained data and the system was
   restarted prior to the log record for that free was flushed
   to disk. [#14090]
   4. Fix a bug that could cause log files to be incorrectly
   removed by log_archive if it was run immediately after
   recovery. [#14874]

Memory Pool Subsystem Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could cause corruption to the buffer
   pool cache if a race condition was hit while using
   DB->Compact. [#14360]
   2. Fix a bug where cache pages could be leaked in applications
   creating temporary files for which the DB_MPOOL_NOFILE flag
   was set. [#14544]

Transaction Subsystem Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that could cause extra empty pages to appear in
   a database file after recovery. [#11118]
   2. Fix a bug triggered when running recovery with a feedback
   function that could cause a NULL pointer dereference. [#13834]
   3. Fix a bug where running recovery could create duplicate
   entries in the data directory list. [#13884]
   4. Fix a bug to not trade locks if a write lock is already
   owned. [#13917]
   5. Fix a bug that could cause traps or hangs if the
   DB_TXN->set_name function is used in a multithreaded
   application. [#14033]
   6. Fix a bug so that a transaction can no longer be committed
   after it had deadlocked. [#14037]
   7. Fix a bug that could cause a trap during recovery if
   multiple operations that could remove the same extent are
   recovered. [#14061]
   8. Fix a bug that could cause an extent file to be deleted
   after the last record in the extent was consumed but the
   consuming transaction was aborted. [#14179]
   9. Fix a bug where the parent database would not use
   DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED in certain cases when calling
   DBC->c_pget. [#14361]
  10. Fix a bug so that it is no longer possible to do a
  non-transactional cursor update on a database that is opened
  transactionally. [#14519]
  11. Fix a bug that causes a sequence to ignore the
  DB_AUTO_COMMIT settings. [#14582]
  12. Fix a bug, change txn_recover so that multiple processes
  will recover prepared transactions without requiring that the
  first process stay active. [#14707]

Utility Changes:

   1. Fix a bug that caused db_verify to not check the order on
   leaf pages which were the leftmost children of an internal
   node. [#13004]
   2. Fix a bug that caused db_hotbackup to not backup queue
   extent files. [#13848]
   3. Fix a bug so that db_verify no longer reports that an
   unused hash page is not fully zeroed. [#14030]
   4. Fix a bug where db_stat ignored the -f option to return
   "fast statistics". [#14283]
   5. Fix a bug that prevented the db_stat utility from opening
   database files with write permission so that meta data
   statistics would be updated. [#14755]

Configuration, Documentation, Portability and Build Changes:

   1. The Berkeley DB 4.3 and 4.4 releases disallowed using
   the --with-uniquename configuration option with the C++,
   Java, or RPC --enable-XXX options. The 4.5 release returns
   to the 4.2 release behavior, allowing those combinations of
   configuration options. [#14067]
   2. Fix build issues when CONFIG_TEST is not enabled for
   Tcl. [#14507]
   3. There are updated build instructions for Berkeley DB PHP
   module on Linux. [#14249]
   4. Use libtool's "standard" environment variable names so that
   you can set "AR" to "ar -X64" for example, and modify both
   libtool and the Makefile commands. Remove the install-strip
   target from the Makefile, it is no longer used. [#14726]
