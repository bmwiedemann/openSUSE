    can disambiguate between building nodes and creating children
    in a lazy tree. This does, unfortunately, break existing code

    hardware.
  + Menu buttons now remove the proper section item when handling
    GMenuModel changes.
  + Our meson-based build system now checks if version-script is
    supported and only applies the ABI map in that case. We may

  + A fallback for strcasecmp() is included for Windows.
  + DzlSuggestion will now use intern'd strings for icon-names to
