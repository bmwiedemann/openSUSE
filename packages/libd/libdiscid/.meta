  <title>Library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs</title>
  <description>libdiscid is a C library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio
CDs. It reads a CD's table of contents (TOC) and generates an
identifier which can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz.
Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID to the
database.

The interface of this library is new, but the DiscID algorithm and the
operating system dependent CD-ROM/DVD-ROM access code have been ported
from libmusicbrainz version 2. For more info about the interface read
the [WWW] API documentation.</description>
