- update to 1.9:
  * Heuristics were implemented which significantly improve the compression
    ratio on data where short matches aren't useful, such as DNA sequencing
    data.  This applies to all compression levels, but primarily to levels 1-9.
  * Levels 1 was made much faster, though it often compresses slightly worse
    than before (but still better than zlib).
  * Levels 8-9 were also made faster, though they often compress slightly worse
    than before (but still better than zlib).  On some data, levels 8-9 are much
    faster and compress much better than before; this change addressed an issue
    where levels 8-9 did poorly on certain files.  The algorithm used by levels
    8-9 is now more similar to that of levels 6-7 than to that of levels 10-12.
  * Levels 2-3, 7, and 10-12 were strengthened slightly.
  * Levels 4-6 were also strengthened slightly, but some of this improvement was
    traded off to speed them up slightly as well.
  * Levels 1-9 had their per-compressor memory usage greatly reduced.
  * `make install` will now install a pkg-config file for libdeflate.
  * The Makefile now supports the `DISABLE_SHARED` parameter to disable building
    the shared library.

- update to 1.8:
  * Added `-t` (test) option to `libdeflate-gunzip`.
  * Unaligned access optimizations are now enabled on WebAssembly builds.
  * Fixed a build error when building with the Intel C Compiler (ICC).
  * Fixed a build error when building with uClibc.
  * libdeflate's CI system has switched from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.
  * Made some improvements to test scripts.

- Add workaround build fail due issue in dwz by deleting 
  libdeflate-gunzip and replace with symlink libdeflate-gzip to 
  fix dwz break with hardlink.
