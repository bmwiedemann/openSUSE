- update to 1.18:
  * Fixed a bug where the build type didn't default to "Release"
    when using CMake 3.10 or earlier.
  * Fixed a bug where some optimized code wasn't used when
    building with Clang 15 or later (x86), or with Clang 16 
    or later (aarch64).
  * Fixed build errors with some architecture and compiler
    combos:
    * aarch64 with Clang 16
    * armv6kz or armv7e-m with gcc
    * armhf with gcc (on Debian only)

- update to 1.17:
  * Improved the compression ratio at levels 10-12 slightly, mainly
    levels 11-12. Some inputs (such as certain PNG files) see much
    improved compression ratios. As a trade-off, compressing at
    levels 11-12 is now about 5-20% slower.
  * For consistency with zlib, the decompressor now returns an error
    on some invalid inputs that were accepted before.
  * Fixed a build error on arm64 with gcc with certain target CPUs.
  * Fixed a build error in programs/gzip.c with uClibc.

Thu Dec 29 22:30:08 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.15:
  * libdeflate now uses CMake instead of a plain Makefile.

- update to 1.14:
  Significantly improved decompression performance on all platforms.  Examples
  include (measuring DEFLATE only):
  | Platform                           | Speedup over v1.13 |
  |------------------------------------|--------------------|
  | x86_64 (Intel Comet Lake), gcc     | 1.287x             |

Mon Aug  8 20:57:28 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.13:
  * Changed the 32-bit Windows build of the library to use the default calling
    convention (cdecl) instead of stdcall, reverting a change from libdeflate 1.4.
  * Fixed a couple macOS compatibility issues with the gzip program. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 15:21:57 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.12:
  * Improved CRC-32 performance on short inputs on x86 and ARM.
  * Improved CRC-32 performance on Apple Silicon Macs by using a 12-way pmull
    implementation.   Performance on large inputs on M1 is now about 67 GB/s,
    compared to 8 GB/s before, or 31 GB/s with the Apple-provided zlib.
  * Improved CRC-32 performance on some other ARM CPUs by reworking the code so
    that multiple crc32 instructions can be issued in parallel.
  * Improved CRC-32 performance on some x86 CPUs by increasing the stride length
    of the pclmul implementation.
  * Improved Adler-32 performance on some x86 CPUs by optimizing the AVX-2
    implementation.  E.g., performance on Zen 1 improved from 19 to 30 GB/s, and
    on Ice Lake from 35 to 41 GB/s (if the AVX-512 implementation is excluded).
  * Removed the AVX-512 implementation of Adler-32 to avoid CPU frequency
    downclocking, and because the AVX-2 implementation was made faster.
  * Improved Adler-32 performance on some ARM CPUs by optimizing the NEON
  * Improved compression performance slightly.
  * Detect arm64 CPU features on Apple platforms, which should improve
    performance in some areas such as CRC-32 computation.
  * The included `gzip` and `gunzip` programs now support the `-q` option.
  * The included `gunzip` program now passes through non-gzip data when both
    the `-f` and `-c` options are used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 14 23:14:56 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.10:
  * Added an additional check to the decompressor to make it quickly detect
    certain bad inputs and not try to generate an unbounded amount of output.
  * Cleaned up a few things in the compression code. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 24 22:39:11 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9:
  * Heuristics were implemented which significantly improve the compression
    ratio on data where short matches aren't useful, such as DNA sequencing
    data.  This applies to all compression levels, but primarily to levels 1-9.
  * Levels 1 was made much faster, though it often compresses slightly worse
    than before (but still better than zlib).
  * Levels 8-9 were also made faster, though they often compress slightly worse
    than before (but still better than zlib).  On some data, levels 8-9 are much
    faster and compress much better than before; this change addressed an issue
    where levels 8-9 did poorly on certain files.  The algorithm used by levels
    8-9 is now more similar to that of levels 6-7 than to that of levels 10-12.
  * Levels 2-3, 7, and 10-12 were strengthened slightly.
  * Levels 4-6 were also strengthened slightly, but some of this improvement was
    traded off to speed them up slightly as well.
  * Levels 1-9 had their per-compressor memory usage greatly reduced.
  * `make install` will now install a pkg-config file for libdeflate.
  * The Makefile now supports the `DISABLE_SHARED` parameter to disable building
    the shared library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 22:37:30 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8:
  * Added `-t` (test) option to `libdeflate-gunzip`.
  * Unaligned access optimizations are now enabled on WebAssembly builds.
  * Fixed a build error when building with the Intel C Compiler (ICC).
  * Fixed a build error when building with uClibc.
  * libdeflate's CI system has switched from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.
  * Made some improvements to test scripts.

- Add workaround build fail due issue in dwz by deleting 
  libdeflate-gunzip and replace with symlink libdeflate-gzip to 
  fix dwz break with hardlink.
