%description
libdeflate is a library for whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression
and decompression. It supports raw, zlib-wrapped and gzip-wrapped DEFLATE.
It is significantly faster than zlib and gzip (+72-187%%).
In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
above zlib's "level 9".

%description -n    %{libname}
libdeflate is a library for whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression
and decompression. It supports raw, zlib-wrapped and gzip-wrapped DEFLATE.
It is significantly faster than the zlib library:

 - decompression speedup over gzip-1.10 is 2.28x (generic), 2.87x (AVX2)
 - compression speedup over gzip is 1.72x (generic), 2.23x (AVX2)

In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
above zlib's "level 9".
