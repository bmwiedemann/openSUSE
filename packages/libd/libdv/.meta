  <title>The Quasar DV Codec</title>
  <description>The Quasar DV codec (libdv) is a software codec for DV video, the
encoding format used by most digital camcorders, typically those that
support the IEEE 1394 (FireWire or i.Link) interface. Libdv was
developed according to the official standards for DV video: IEC 61834
and SMPTE 314M.

There are two sample applications included with libdv: playdv and
