  <title>Library supporting &quot;Deferred Execution&quot; for GNOME and GTK</title>
  <description>Dex is a library supporting &quot;Deferred Execution&quot; with the explicit
goal of integrating with GNOME and GTK-based applications.
It provides primatives for supporting futures in a variety of ways
with both read-only and writable views. Additionally, integration
with existing asynchronous-based APIs is provided through the use
of wrapper promises.
&quot;Fibers&quot; are implemented which allows for writing synchronous
looking code which calls asynchronous APIs from GIO underneath.
