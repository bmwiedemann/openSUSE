- Update to version 0.5.1:
  + Add convenience API for checking exact future status without
    enum.
  + Lots of documentation additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 13 07:49:46 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  + Various API now warns about unused results to help avoid
    unintended leaks of futures.
  + dex_file_query_exists() is a new wrapper for
    g_file_query_exists().
  + Documentation fixes.

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  + This release includes an important fix for how io_uring CQE are
    handled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 17 01:09:23 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.4.0:
  + Documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  6 01:13:35 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Drop pkgconfig(sysprof-4) BuildRequires. This was only needed
  because sysprof-capture-static-devel was lacking header files,
  which was mistakenly being packaged with sysprof-devel, and it's
  fixed now.
- Add with(out) "profiling" build switch and disable it, by
  default, as profiling isn't meant for general use. This nests
  pkgconfig(sysprof-capture-4) BuildRequires under an if-with
  expression and passes profiler=(true|false) to meson, depending
  on the profiling switch. Disabling this should also avoid a build
  cycle introduced by Sysprof 45 by requiring libdex.

Thu Aug 10 09:12:48 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.1:
  + A new "Infinite" future type which will never resolve or
    reject.
  + The gio wrappers will now set debuggable names for their
    futures.
  + A `dex_async_pair_set_cancel_on_discard()` function has been
    added which ensures that the `GCancellable` will not be
    cancelled when the future is discarded. This can help in
    situations where you might repeatedly await on a future and do
    not want intermediate cancellation between attempts to await.
  + A `dex_input_stream_skip_async()` function has been added to
    wrap the underlying GIO function.
  + A `dex_future_disown()` function has been added which
    simplifies the case where you want a future to run but are not
    interested in the result.

Tue Jul 11 12:20:10 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.3.0:
  + Documentation updates
  + pkg-config improvements
  + Build system improvements for GIR
  + Support for GVariant-based futures
  + New Future-based wrappers for GDBusConnection
  + The FD-based AIO API is now public, allowing for use of
    io_uring on Linux kernels that support it. If unsupported, a
    threadpool approach is used similar to GIO
  + Improvements to introspection for language bindings
  + You can now return NULL for a DexPromise expecting a GObject as
    as a resolved value
  + DexFiber will now get static names associated with them when
    used from C which points to the line of code. This is only
    enabled when debugging is enabled for libdex through the use of
    macros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 17 19:46:13 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  + Followup fixes for building on mips.
  + Fixes for introspection gi-scanner.
  + Remove abstract type flag from DexFuture to satisfy GObject
    Introspection rules about constructors.
  + Many documentation/gi-annotation fixes.
  + Build system improvements.
  + Default to `-Dintrospection=enabled`.
