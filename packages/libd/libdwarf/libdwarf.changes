Fri Dec  2 19:23:16 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.5.0:
  * libdwarf-0.5.0 improves library performance reading
    DWARF DIEs by several percent (with no change in API).
  * It adds functions allowing acess to the .debug_addr
    section independent of other sections.
    dwarfdump has a new option to show that
    section.
  * Corrects the handling of some aspects of
    reading the .debug_names section.
  * Enhances dwarf_get_globals() to return
    all globals that .debug_pubnames and .debug_names
    refer to (no change in the API except adding
    a function to return the DW_TAG of any globals
    derived from .debug_names)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 15:23:25 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.2:
  * memory leak fixes
  * How to deal with a dwarf_init*() call
    that fails (DW_DLV_ERROR) in a simple way is finally
    documented in libdwarf.pdf and in the on-line html. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 19:11:15 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.1 (bsc#1200899, CVE-2022-34299):
  * Two places where a carefully corrupted object file
    could result in libdwarf crashing a caller due to
    referencing memory outside the intended read area
    have been fixed (DW202205-001 and DW202206-001).
    One related to DW_FORM_ref_sig8, the other to
    the .debug_pubnames section.
  * The library now accepts DW_AT_entry_pc in a CU DIE as a base address
    when DW_AT_low_pc is missing (an extension used by
    a current compiler).
  * Added function dwarf_suppress_debuglink_crc() to allow
    callers to turn off doing a CRC calculation
    reading GNU debuglink data (saves time for library
    users accessing near-identical builds).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 24 20:07:05 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.0:
  * Removed the unused Dwarf_Error argument from dwarf_return_empty_pubnames()
    as the function can only return DW_DLV_OK. dwarf_xu_header_free() renamed
    to dwarf_dealloc_xu_header().  dwarf_gdbindex_free() renamed
    to dwarf_dealloc_gdbindex(). dwarf_loc_head_c_dealloc renamed to
    dwarf_dealloc_loc_head_c().
  * dwarf_get_location_op_value_d() renamed to dwarf_get_location_op_value_c(),
    and 3 pointless arguments removed. The dwarf_get_location_op_value_d
    version and the three arguments were added for DWARF5 in libdwarf20210528
    but the change was a mistake. Now reverted to the previous version.
  * The .debug_names section interfaces have changed. Added
    dwarf_dnames_offsets() to provide details of facts useful in problems
    reading the section. dwarf_dnames_name() now does work
    and the interface was changed to make it easier to use.

Fri Jun 11 10:18:23 UTC 2021 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- update to 20210528:
  corrects libdwarf's handling of DWARF5 line table header DW_LNCT
  entries. Dwarfdump now prints DW_OP_bra and DW_OP_skip correctly
  and correctly validates the target of these operators.
  adds summary information on attribute/form-class uses and
  attribute/forms use to the existing option -ku summary on tags
  and attributes. Dwarfdump verifies many attribute references are
  usable and prints a little from the target DIE, including with
  DW_FORM_ref_sig8 references. Now dwarf.h shows many more
  extensions (added by compiler developers) to the TAGs and
  ATtributes defines. Alongide releases is a pdf,
  libdwarf2.1xl.pdf (xl.pdf as it is extra-large), that is the
  same as the latest libdwarf2.1.pdf but with the
  table-of-contents at the front, not the back, of the pdf.
  Created an experiment, it is around 15MB so seemed too large to
  place it in the release or to do multiple versions. Later
  updates will just replace it on prevanders.net.

Fri Jan 29 22:02:13 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20201201:
  dwarfdump now prints DWARF expression operators each on
  its own line.  This makes viewing DWARF expressions much
  nicer given the increased use of much longer expressions.
  Those expression operators that reference DIES are now
  followed, verified, and the target DW_TAG and DW_AT_name
  are printed.  A new dwarfdump.conf command 'option:' lets
  one specify option: --format-expr-ops-joined in case you
  want the old style DWARF expression operators-on-one-line.
  Where the DWARF DIE children nest > nine-deep dwarfdump
  switches from indentation by spaces to a nest-level number.

- update to 20200825 (bsc#1142609, CVE-2019-14249)
  libdwarf now reads .debug_gnu_pubtypes & pubnames
  (non-standard but gcc creates them in DWARF5)
  via a small number of new functions
  and dwarfdump  --print-debug-gnu prints both sections.
  Verifying the .debug_info offsets is not yet done.
  Dwarfdump now dumps DWARF5 .debug_rnglists and
  .debug_loclists.  To handle DWARF5 there are
  a small number of new functions. All existing
  functions are still supported, but
  to read DWARF5 some small changes are required.
  In libdwarf see libdwarf2.1.pdf and also see
  dwarfdump now takes much less malloc() to work, as measured
  by valgrind --tool=massif  and massif-visualizer.
  A dwarfdump run that did 2.2Gib of malloc/free before the changes
  now does 1.4GiB.
  libdwarf and dwarfdump now support DWARF5 .debug_rnglists.
  The new interfaces are documented in libdwarf/libdwarf2.1.pdf.
  The new option to dwarfdump is "--print-raw-rnglists".
  The code (dwarfdump/libdwarf), regressiontests,
  and readelfobj directories and all their tests
  are known to work on Linux(Ubuntu on x86_64 and i686), 
  FreeBSD, MacOS Catalina (with Apple Command Line Tools),
  and IBM s390 (Big Endian!) running Ubuntu Linux.
  On Windows-MinGW the full regression tests
  have not been tested, but 'make check' works
  for dwarfdump/libdwarf (the current dwarfdump 
  make check actually does run dwarfdump and 
  checks that dwarfdump basically works).
  Now a --disable-libelf configure/build of libdwarf/dwarfdump
  can read elf, mach-o DSYM, and PE executable/dll object files.
  Such a build will not need or use libelf or elf.h .
  The dwarfdump options that display Elf section headers
  or relocation record data are not available in a 
  --disable-libelf build. 
  Nor is dwarfdump's support of reading archive files
  available in a --disable-libelf build. 
  This libdwarf detects corrupt Elf object files much sooner
  than before, but does not explain what the corruption
  really is. Use GNU readelf (or readelfobj, a project
  on sourceforge) to get more detail about the problems found.  
  See https://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html for the git clone
  command for readelfobj.
  With --disable-libelf the --enable-dwarfgen option
  does not work: the dwarfgen build will fail.
  For building on machines without a usable elf.h or libelf
  but possibly with a libelf.h visible, --disable-libelf
  ensures the build won't use libelf or elf.h anywhere. 
  -lz will be done if zlib.h is visible, independent of
  libelf, libelf.h, and elf.h
  If one has a standard Bourne shell (sh) available
  (such as sh on MacOS and sh in MinGW on Windows)
  one may be able to build libdwarf and dwarfdump natively
  and they can read Mach-o dSYM and PE object files
  to access DWARF information. 
  This has NOT been tested under MacOS, so will likely
  fail on MacOS.
  No elf.h, libelf.h or zlib.h should be present. 
  For example, the following
  is known to work under MinGW and this general plan
  applies to all builds including all builds with elf.h
  and libelf:
    mkdir test
    cd test
    #(copy the source tree into test, if from git
    #the name of the top level will likely be 'code')
    cd code
   The pre-build dwarf_names.[hc] and the tag related
  files are now part of the standard build so there is
  no longer any two-stage aspect of the build. 
  The build simply compiles files in the distribution.
  If you use git to access the source be sure to
  sh scripts/FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES
  to adjust the file timestamps as having timestamps
  in the right relationships is vital and git
  does not maintain timestamps.
  The script is always safe to run. It takes about 30 seconds.
  The complicated process of building certain .c and .h
  files has been relegated to the few people updating
  files libdwarf/libdwarf.h.in, libdwarf/dwarf_errmsg_list.h,
  dwarfdump/tag_attr_ext.list,dwarfdump/tag_attr.list,
  dwarfdump/tag_tree_ext.list, and dwarfdump/tag_tree.list.
  For everyone else the build is simply compiling
  the .c and .h files in the distribution. Simpler.
    sh scripts/buildstandardsource.sh
  creates these files.
  dwarfdump can now dump mach-o (MacOS) dSYM dwarf.
  All the usual libdwarf interfaces work.
  A new libdwarf initialization call dwarf_init_path()
  may be convenient for you to use.

* A mistake in handling DW_OP_GNU_const_type could lead to a
  libdwarf coredump at times.
* Added AARCH64 relocation support.
* Adds GNU-specific DW_FORM codes so recent gcc objects can be
  read usefully.
* Adds new functions to libdwarf for new DWARF reference types.
* Libdwarf now follows the DWARF2 standard properly in reading
  DW_FORM_ref_addr.
* Source incompatibility for users of producer code:
  dwarf_producer_init() now has a new interface and a sensible way
  to select the output ABI/ISA for relocation numbers. Part of
  preparation to emit DWARF3,4,5.
* The reader code now handles DebugFission, called Split Dwarf
  objects in the draft DWARF5 standard.
* The reader now can get the content of .gdbindex and
  .debug_cu_index and .debug_tu_index sections and dwarfdump -I
  can print them. Support is incomplete for the cu,tu sections:
  They exist in a .dwp object (GNU Debug Fission, to be in DWARF5)
  which is not yet properly handled.

  Minor improvements: dwarfdump print_reloc.c referred to
  sym_data_entry_count in one place where sym_data_64_entry_count
  should have been tested. DW_DLA_PUBTYPE_CONTEXT was a typo,
  DW_DLE_PUBTYPE_CONTEXT was intended. Fixed indentation and
  removed some tabs in favor of spaces (in five files). A couple
  files had a couple lines with CR-LF line endings, the CR is now
  gone. Corrected minor typographical errors in libdwarf2p.1.mm and

  Fixed an off-by-one in dwarfdump which could reference off the
  end of an array in a specfic circumstance and verify string table
  index refers to inside the table when printing relocations.
  Corrected return code from libdwarf when there is no dwarf
  information. Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso for noticing the
  bugs. Fixed indentation and removed some tabs in favor of
  spaces (in a few files).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 11 11:48:34 CEST 2008 - bwalle@suse.de

- update to 20080125
  In the producer library code dwarf_die_link() is now O(1) where
  it was O(N) before. Thanks to Daniel Gollub for finding this
  performance improvement. dwarf_die_link() now back-links siblings
  (in its internal lists) correctly. The back link bug had no
  (known) effect on dwarf generated by libdwarf.

- update to 20080208
  Due to a typo, calling _dwarf_fde_section_offset() (a interface
  which is still supported) would lead to an infinite loop in
  libdwarf-20071209 and libdwarf-20080125. The libdwarf producer
  forms code now allows more of the newer attributes (so is more
  complete). Alloca is no longer used anywhere (it was really only
  used one place). The libdwarf producer code controlling the
  offset-size is more sensible: standard DWARF (32 bit offsets) is
  the default, use configure --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix to get
  IRIX 64bit offsets. See the libdwarf README and libdwarf2p.1.pdf
  for details. Thanks to Carlos Alberto Enciso and Melanie Zumwalde
  for noticing some of these errors.

- update to 20080228
  This changes the libdwarf-internal implementation of reading libelf
  so that the reader is not directly tied to libelf or even elf.
  Meaning a libdwarf can be built that reads other object file types
  or that uses some library other than libelf to do the reading
  (subject only to simple constraints, see libdwarf.h). Thanks to
  Josh Fuhs for designing and implementing the object-file-reader
  revisions.

- update to 20080409
  A giant a.out exposed an inflexible (slow) handling of
  abbreviations in libdwarf as well as showing that one (internal)
  field was too small to accommodate over 64K abbreviations in one
  compilation unit. The relevant hash table adapts now and the field
  is 'large enough'. Added -H and -n options to dwarfdump. Added a
  dwarfdump -ka new check for correctness.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Dec 11 13:58:31 CET 2007 - dgollub@suse.de

- building shared lib (instead of static)
- added LD_LIBRARY_PATH to dwarfdump Makefile, since it runs
  something within the build which is linked against libdwarf.

- update to 20071209
  o Renamed 4 functions so they are now exported by libdwarf as dwarf_*:
    dwarf_fde_section_offset(), dwarf_cie_section_offset(),
    dwarf_print_lines(), and dwarf_ld_sort_lines() are the new names.
  o The old _dwarf_* names are still supported in libdwarf.h but anyone
    building a shared library could choose to export only dwarf_* names
    and dwarfdump will now compile and link successfully with that shared
    library.
  o Added acceptance of .eh_frame S augmentation
  o Updated config.guess config.sub to latest (2006-11-15)
  o Added configure tests and some code in dwarf_incl.h and globals.h
    to define _GNU_SOURCE so that it will all compile with recent libelf.h
    use of off64_t (yet still compile with earlier libelf.h)

- updated to 20071016
  o dwarf_siblingof() could try to access a byte past the
    end of an Elf section leading to a coredump.
  o The dwarf macro reading code could (in the DWARF_SIMPLE_MALLOC
    case only) allocate and free memory inconsistently leading to
    malloc arena corruption.

(updated to 20071015)
   o The special build macro DWARF_SIMPLE_MALLOC was incorrectly
     implemented (now fixed): it could lead builds employing that
     macro to coredump in libdwarf. Now (just before exit) dwarfdump
     free()s some space it previously left mallocd.

(updated to 20070904)
   o Added qualifier for DWARF4 DW_AT_high_pc where applicable in
     dwarfdump output.
   o Added documentation of new producer functions in libdwarf.
   o Misc: Updated FSF address everywhere. Deleted 2 files which
     were never used.

  o DW_CFA_val_expression was handled wrong in libdwarf leading
    eventually to an invalid register number reading a GNU
    .eh_frame section (dwarfdump reported an error).
