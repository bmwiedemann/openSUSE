  <title>Library implementing the DMAP family of protocols</title>
  <description>Libdmapsharing is a library you may use to access, share and control the
playback of media content using DMAP (DAAP, DPAP &amp; DACP). Libdmapsharing
also detects audio AirPlay services; coupled with the AirPlay support
in PulseAudio or GStreamer, this can allow an application to stream audio
to an AirPlay device. The DMAP family of protocols are used by products
such as Apple iTunes, Apple iPhoto, and the Roku SoundBridge family to
share media such as music and photos.</description>
