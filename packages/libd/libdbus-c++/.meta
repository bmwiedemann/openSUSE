  <title>C++ API for D-BUS</title>
  <description>D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a &quot;single instance&quot; application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus-c%2B%2B for more information.

Notes:
- both rpm and deb based distros are building somehow

to-do:
- fix the distros that do not build
- figure out why Ubuntu 7.04/amd64 had expansion errors
- verify content of built packages
- use orig + diff file for rpm based distros, change spec accordingly
