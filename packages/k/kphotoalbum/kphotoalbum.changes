    significantly faster (on my particular system the time to
    display the "Home" page dropped from 500ms to 25ms).

  * Update/Bugfix: Various l10n fixes concerning capitalization and
    contexts.
  * Update: Review default values for Settings, pre-define
    contemporary ones:
    - Ignore common auto-generated Exif comments by default.
    - The database file is now optimized for speed by default
      (old default value: optimized for human readability)
    - If less than 20 images are matched, the thumbnail view is
      shown (old default value: 0)
    - The thumbnail grid is now optimized for a 3:2 aspect ratio
      (old default value: 4:3)
    - The size of thumbnails is now 256x256 pixels
      (old default value: 150)
    - When starting a slideshow, it is now shown in fullscreen by
      default (old default value: 800x600px)
    - Detect edited images by default
      (old default value: feature was not configured)
      This means that images that have been edited using the
      "create a copy and open" feature now are recognized by
      default. The tags of the original image are copied and both
      images are automatically stacked.

  * Bugfix: More reliable auto-stacking of images.
  * Enhancements: Improved speed of loading/removing new images:
    - Insert Exif data for each loaded image as it's loaded, but
      within a transaction.
    - Elide unnecessary MD5 computations.
    - Reduce I/O wait time of image loader by introducing a scout
      thread.
    - Improve I/O efficiency for MD5 calculation.
    - Fetch Exif data only once during load.
    - Improve efficiency of loading previews from RAW images.
    - Ignore more sidecar files to improve performance
      (.xmp, .pp3, and .pto).
  * Enhancement/Bugfix: Scale the date bar appropriately upon
    exposure, add one minute scaler.
  * Update: Make Android app compilable with C++14 and later.
  * Rework: General code cleanup, coding standard updates etc. all
    over the place.
