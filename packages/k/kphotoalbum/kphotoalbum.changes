- Update to 5.5
  * Bugfix: Fix compilation with exiv2 0.27
  * Enhancement: Display dates when browsing categories. When
    browsing categories, two columns "Start Date" and "End Date"
    have been added. These columns correspond to the time range of
    the images tagged with that particular tag.
  * Enhancement: Faster display of browser overview page. Depending
    on the current context, the overview should now be displayed
    significantly faster (on my particular system the time to
    display the "Home" page dropped from 500ms to 25ms).
  * Change: More intuitive handling of down button in annotation
    dialog. Pressing the "down" button in a ListSelect in the
    annotation dialog now selects the first item, not the second
    one.
  * Change: Use non-linear scaling for DateBar by default
    (kde#356810)
  * Change: Instead of having "increase/decrease thumbnail storage
    size buttons", show a "Thumbnail settings" button in the status
    bar (kde#357239)
  * Bugfix: Restore correct behaviour for "Statistics..." action
  * Bugfix: Fix loading of user shortcuts for the annotation dialog
  * Enhancement: Add "clear selection" menu item
  * Change: More detailed debug output
  * Deprecation: Removed compatibility with Qt versions < 5.9
  * Deprecation: Removed support for MPlayer. For video thumbails,
    only ffmpeg is supported.
  * Enhancement: Smaller performance improvements during startup
  * Bugfix: Fix zooming for raw images
- Drop patches merged upstream:
  * Use-Exiv2-0.27-if-available.patch
  * Fix-compilation-with-exiv2-0.27.patch
- Drop 0001-Fix-build-with-Qt-5.7-and-lower.patch, it requires Qt
  5.9 and KF 5.44 now, the versions in Leap 42.3 are just too old
- Use %kf5_find_htmldocs macro to generate the translated docs
  filelist

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  6 12:04:33 UTC 2019 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 5.4.2

    (kde#403668)

Sat Oct 13 23:32:23 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 5.4
  * Change: Database file now uses version 8 format.
  * Update/Bugfix: Various l10n fixes concerning capitalization and
    contexts.
  * Update: Review default values for Settings, pre-define
    contemporary ones:
    - Ignore common auto-generated Exif comments by default.
    - The database file is now optimized for speed by default
      (old default value: optimized for human readability)
    - If less than 20 images are matched, the thumbnail view is
      shown (old default value: 0)
    - The thumbnail grid is now optimized for a 3:2 aspect ratio
      (old default value: 4:3)
    - The size of thumbnails is now 256x256 pixels
      (old default value: 150)
    - When starting a slideshow, it is now shown in fullscreen by
      default (old default value: 800x600px)
    - Detect edited images by default
      (old default value: feature was not configured)
      This means that images that have been edited using the
      "create a copy and open" feature now are recognized by
      default. The tags of the original image are copied and both
      images are automatically stacked.
  * Bugfix: Use the correct initial value when renaming tag groups
    using the settings page.
  * Enhancement: Improve startup 10-15% by eliding unnecessary
    category creation.

    reset failed state when recreating db.

    dialog.

    leading to false coordinates.

  * Enhancement: Do not write unnecessary data to index.xml by
    using defaults.
  * Enhancements: Improved thumbnail generation:
    - Improve thumbnail generation speed and efficiency.
    - Overlap thumbnail create with image load.
    - Generate new thumbnails for moved images detected during load.
  * Bugfix: More reliable auto-stacking of images.
  * Enhancements: Improved speed of loading/removing new images:
    - Insert Exif data for each loaded image as it's loaded, but
      within a transaction.
    - Elide unnecessary MD5 computations.
    - Reduce I/O wait time of image loader by introducing a scout
      thread.
    - Improve I/O efficiency for MD5 calculation.
    - Fetch Exif data only once during load.
    - Improve efficiency of loading previews from RAW images.
    - Ignore more sidecar files to improve performance
      (.xmp, .pp3, and .pto).
  * Enhancement/Bugfix: Scale the date bar appropriately upon
    exposure, add one minute scaler.
  * Update: Make Android app compilable with C++14 and later.
  * Rework: General code cleanup, coding standard updates etc. all
    over the place.

    labels.
  * Enhancement: Speed up removal of images from database.
  * Enhancement: Add a "Maximum megapixels" option to the search
    dialog.
  * Enhancement: Don't re-compute an MD5 sum we already have when
    adding new images.

    etc.).
