# This tarball needs to be generated from the source tarball shipped with the
# matching kafka package using Tetra (ruby2.2-rubygem-tetra). You will find
# detailed instructions for generating it in README.updating. This is neccessary
# due to Kafka's Gradle based build process downloading dependencies at build
# time. Tetra will keep track of these downloaded dependencies and generate a
# tarball containing all of them. This tarball is then used to allow the same
# build to run in an offline manner in OBS (where there is no Internet
# connectivity).

%description
This package has been automatically created by tetra in order to
satisfy build time dependencies of Java packages.
It should not be used except for rebuilding other packages,
thus it should never be installed on end users' systems.
