%description
kubectl-validate is a SIG-CLI subproject to support the local validation of
resources for native Kubernetes types and CRDs.

This project has two goals:

1. Shift-left validation of resources with as close to parity to server-side
   Kubernetes as possible.
2) Improve declarative validation support in upstream Kubernetes over time,
   making those improvements available for kubectl-validate users early.
