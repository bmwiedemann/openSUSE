- Update to version 1.5.0:
  This is Kubepug v1.5.0!! It was mostly rewritten for performance
  and better results! Thanks for using the project!!  More great
  things are coming for next version!
  * Breaking changes
    - The api-walk flag was removed! There is no need for the flag
      anymore, and Kubepug will always validate against all
      resources!
  * Major changes
    - The main logic of program was simplified and rewritten for
      better performance. A lot of false positives have been
      removed! A bunch of bugs squashed!
    - This release was also a preparation for a bigger one, that
      will allow better tuning of APIs to be validated, and a much
      reliable API database. Also, it allows a better extension, so
      someone willing to use Kubepug as a library, a webhook, or
      even writing their own output plugin will be able to do it!
