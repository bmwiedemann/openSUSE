Sat Nov 14 03:02:27 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 14 02:45:57 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Filter version so that we have, e.g., "1.0" rather than "v1.0"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 21:14:08 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Switch obs_scm and set_version services to "disabled"
  * To enable the build on platform where set_version is not available
  * Disabled services are now run manually and the resulting files
    (kernelshark-v1.0.obscpio and kernelshark.obsinfo) are added to
    the repository
  * Running set_version has also fixed "Version:" in the spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 09:32:56 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Fix the build on (Tumbleweed) i586
  * In makefile-lib64.patch, using FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
    results in CMake still putting the libraries in lib64
  * Switch to checking CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P instead, works (and
    is similar to what we do in trace-cmd's Makefile, where we
    check LONG_BIT == 64)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 24 20:05:21 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Add a 0001-trace-cmd-fix-multiple-definition-compiler-errors.patch
  * Backport  of a fix for letting trace-cmd compile with gcc 10
- Add kernelshark-make-fontheight.patch
  * Backport of a fix for letting kernelshark compile with gcc 10
- Parallel build does not work for the `gui` target (build of kernelshark
  starts when trace-cmd hasn't finished building yet). Call the `trace-cmd`
  target before, explicitly, as a workaround
