- Update to version 1.9.0:
  * Urgent Upgrade Notes
    https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubeone/v1.9/tutorials/upgrading/upgrading-from-1.8-to-1.9/
    (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)
    - Add support for Ubuntu 24.04. Example Terraform configs for
      all providers are now using Ubuntu 24.04 by default. If
      you're using the latest Terraform configs with an existing
      cluster, make sure to bind the operating system/image to the
      image that you're currently using, otherwise your
      instances/cluster might get recreated by Terraform. On some
      providers, machine-controller will use Ubuntu 24.04 if the
      image is not explicitly specified. (#3302, @SimonTheLeg)
    - Example Terraform configs for Hetzner are now using cx22
      instead of cx21 instance type by default. If you use the
      latest Terraform configs with an existing cluster, make sure
      to override the instance type as needed, otherwise your
      instances/cluster might get recreated by Terraform. (#3370,
      @kron4eg)
    - KubeOne is now validating that IP addresses and hostnames
      provided for control plane nodes and static worker nodes are
      different. In other words, it's not possible to use the same
      machine both as a control plane node and a static worker
      node. This behavior has never been supported by KubeOne; if
      you want a control plane node that can schedule any pod, you
      can provision it as a control plane node and remove the
      control plane taint
      (node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule). (#3334,
      @kron4eg)
    - Update Cilium to v1.16.3. This change might affect users that
      have nodes that are low on capacity (pods or resources wise).
      The Cilium architecture has been changed so that the Envoy
      Proxy is not integrated into Cilium, but is a dedicated
      component/DaemonSet. If you have nodes that are low on
      capacity, you might encounter issues when trying to start
      Envoy Proxy pods on those nodes. In this case, you'll need to
      override the Cilium addon to use the old architecture with
      Envoy Proxy integrated into Cilium. (#3415, @xmudrii) kubeone
      install and kubeone upgrade subcommands are removed. We have
      deprecated these commands in KubeOne 1.4, and made them
      hidden in KubeOne 1.5. With this change, we're permanently
      removing these two commands. kubeone apply should be used
      instead. (#3349, @mohamed-rafraf)

- Update to version 1.8.0:
  Urgent Upgrade Notes
  (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)
  * Refactor example Terraform configs for Hetzner to randomly
    generate the private network subnet in order to support
    creating multiple KubeOne clusters (#3152, @xmudrii)
  * The example Terraform configs for Azure have been migrated to
    use the Standard SKU for IP addresses. This is a breaking
    change for existing setups; in which case you should continue
    using your current SKU. Manual migration is possible by
    dissociating IP from the VM and LB, the migrating it, and
    assigning it back, however please consider all potential risks
    before doing this migration (#3149, @kron4eg)
  * Credentials defined in the credentials file now have precedence
    over credentials defined via environment variables. This change
    is made to match the behavior that's already documented in the
    KubeOne docs. If you use both the credentials file and the
    environment variables, we recommend double-checking your
    credentials file to make sure the credentials are up to date,
    as those credentials will be applied on the next kubeone apply
    run (#2991, @kron4eg)
  * kured has been removed, you have to re-enable it back in form
    of helmRelease (#3024, @kron4eg)
  * OSM: The latest Ubuntu 22.04 images on Azure have modified the
    configuration for cloud-init and how it accesses its datasource
    in Azure, in a breaking way. If you're having an Azure cluster,
    it's required to refresh your machines with the latest provided
    OSPs to ensure that a system-wide package update doesn't result
    in broken machines. (#3172, @xrstf)
  * Support for Docker is removed; containerRuntime.docker became a
    no-op. (#3008, @kron4eg)
