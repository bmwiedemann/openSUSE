- Update to version 1.8.0:
  Urgent Upgrade Notes
  (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)
  * Refactor example Terraform configs for Hetzner to randomly
    generate the private network subnet in order to support
    creating multiple KubeOne clusters (#3152, @xmudrii)
  * The example Terraform configs for Azure have been migrated to
    use the Standard SKU for IP addresses. This is a breaking
    change for existing setups; in which case you should continue
    using your current SKU. Manual migration is possible by
    dissociating IP from the VM and LB, the migrating it, and
    assigning it back, however please consider all potential risks
    before doing this migration (#3149, @kron4eg)
  * Credentials defined in the credentials file now have precedence
    over credentials defined via environment variables. This change
    is made to match the behavior that's already documented in the
    KubeOne docs. If you use both the credentials file and the
    environment variables, we recommend double-checking your
    credentials file to make sure the credentials are up to date,
    as those credentials will be applied on the next kubeone apply
    run (#2991, @kron4eg)
  * kured has been removed, you have to re-enable it back in form
    of helmRelease (#3024, @kron4eg)
  * OSM: The latest Ubuntu 22.04 images on Azure have modified the
    configuration for cloud-init and how it accesses its datasource
    in Azure, in a breaking way. If you're having an Azure cluster,
    it's required to refresh your machines with the latest provided
    OSPs to ensure that a system-wide package update doesn't result
    in broken machines. (#3172, @xrstf)
  * Support for Docker is removed; containerRuntime.docker became a
    no-op. (#3008, @kron4eg)
