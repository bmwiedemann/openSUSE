Tue Jul  2 06:56:50 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2018.07.01:
  * Re-organized bundled script files directory hierarchy.
  * Introduced helpers to write/read from file in scripts with
    %file{...} expansion and echo -to-file <filename>.
  * Added ClientCreate and ClientClose hooks
  * edit -scratch with no buffer name will create a new
    scratch buffer with a unique autogenerated name.
  * info -placement is now info -style and supports
    menu and modal additional styles.
  * completions option type docstring are now arbitrary
    kakoune commands that are run on item select.
  * InsertCompletionSelect hook has been removed as
    completions commands now provides a similar feature.
  * Introduced a module system using the provide-module and
    require-module commands that allows for lazily loading language
    support files with dependency resolution.
  * Added a new hook ModuleLoaded which is run after a module is
    loaded, allowing for module specific configuration.
  * Shell quoting of lists is not automatic anymore, $kak_quoted_...
    makes it opt-in, and works for all option types.
  * Lower case function key syntax is not accepted anymore,
    <f1> should be converted to <F1>.
- Change to gnu++17 standard

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 09:58:57 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to to 2019.01.20:
  * auto_complete has been renamed to autocomplete for more
    consistency.
  * Start of a builtin key parser in the ncurses ui bypassing
    the ncurses one. Can be favored by setting the ui option
  * Right clicks extend the current selection, the control modifier allows
    merging all the selections after extension.
  * The regex highlighter now supports named capture groups to
    ease readability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 29 18:58:52 UTC 2018 - igonzalezsosa@suse.com

- Update to 2018.10.27:
  * remove-hooks argument is now a regex and removes all hooks whose group matches it.
  * exclusive face attribute (e) has been replaced with more granular final foreground (f), final
    background (g), and final attributes (a), or the three combined as final (F). Semantics changed
    slightly as those attributes apply to the existing face as well (a final face will not get
    modified by a following face if that following face does not have the final attribute itself.
  * <a-m> aka "merge consecutive selections" has been moved to <a-_>. The new <a-m> and <a-M> are
    now symmetrical with m and M. Those commands select (or extend) to the matching char backwards.
  * define-command switches -shell-completion and -shell-candidates have been renamed to
    -shell-script-completion and -shell-script-candidates to make way for a new -shell-completion
    which completes like the shell (shell command name then filename).
  * asciidoc is not a dependency anymore, the last file that requiered it (Kakoune's manpage) has
    been converted to troff format.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 06:13:36 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2018.09.04:
  This version contains a significant overhaul of various Kakoune features that can break user configuration
  * %sh{...} strings are not reparsed automatically anymore, they need to go through an explicit evaluate-commands
  * The -allow-override switch from define-command has been renamed -override.
  * The search prompt uses buffer word completion so that fuzzy completion can be used to quickly search for a buffer word.
  * The wrap highlighter can accept a new -marker <marker_text> switch.
  * The command line syntax has changed to support robust escapin
  * Escaping of ' in '...' and " and % in "..." strings is done by doubling up ('', "" and %%) instead of using a backslash
  * Bare words escaping has been tweaked.
  * See :doc command-parsing.
  * See :doc highlighters
