Fri Oct 03 16:13:27 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 52.9.0:
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Added a Helm property to control the duration before
      Kubeshark automatically enters
      [Dormant](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/on_off_switch) mode to
      conserve resources when idle. In Dormant mode, resource
      consumption is minimized. This behavior can be disabled via
      Helm. Kubeshark will not enter Dormant mode if any dashboard,
      Agent logic script, or recording is active.
    - The hostroot volume is now created only when the tracer is
      deployed. tracer deployment is controlled by the
      tap.tls=true/false setting.
    - Introduced support for defining a custom ingress path via the
      Helm value: tap.ingress.path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 19 07:12:38 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 52.8.1:
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Fixed support for Cgroup V2 in cases where additional
      privileges are required.
    - Implemented a traffic processing timeout for periods of
      complete inactivity:
      - A new Helm value has been introduced to define the timeout
        duration when there is no dashboard streaming traffic, no
        active recordings, and no agents operating.
      - In such cases, Kubeshark will transition into a Dormant
        state until new activity is detected.
      - During the Dormant state, traffic processing is halted, and
        resource consumption is minimized.
      - This ensures Kubeshark consumes negligible system resources
        unless actively in use.

Fri Apr 18 05:29:51 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 52.7.0:
  * Release Highlights
    This update adds new Helm options, improves GitOps
    compatibility, and enhances traffic capture with AF_PACKET. It
    also fixes bugs related to CLI exit, packet loss, Kafka
    crashes, and watchdog stability.
    Keywords: AF_PACKET, BPF, Dex, PVC, Kafka, Packet loss, Scripts
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Added support for tapping network interface traffic using
      AF_PACKET. This can be configured by entering a BPF
      expression (e.g., net 0.0.0.0/0) in the BPF OVERRIDE field in
      the Settings dialog. Useful when expected traffic is not
      being captured.
    - Added the Helm value tap.dashboard.completeStreamingEnabled,
      which sets the default mode for full (with payload) or
      partial (without payload) processing. This option can also be
      controlled from the dashboard.
    - Added the Helm value tap.auth.dexOidc.bypassSslCaCheck, which
      allows communication with a Dex IdP using an unknown SSL
      Certificate Authority, preventing SSL CA-related errors.
    - Added support for azure-csi-premium for RWX PVC volumes
      (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azuredisk-csi-driver/tree/master/deploy/example/sharedisk).
    - Disabled the online chat option by default.
    - Added support for a GitOps-friendly mode where dynamically
      changed configmap and secret values are preserved during Helm
      upgrades, avoiding CI/CD system overrides while Kubeshark is
      running.
    - Enabled the kubeshark CLI to use a proprietary configuration
      file.
    - Fixed a protocol matcher bug caused by packet loss (#1746).
    - Fixed a panic that occasionally occurred in the Kafka
      dissector.
    - Fixed a bug where the watchdog function could crash the
      Worker when no traffic was being processed on the node.
    - Fixed a bug in the kubeshark scripts command where it didn't
      exit properly upon receiving ^C.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 25 05:43:14 UTC 2025 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 52.6.0:
  In this release, we fixed several bugs and added notable
  integrations. Highlights include support for OIDC with DEX and
  the ability to host Kubeshark behind a reverse proxy using a
  custom path.
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Optimized service map performance for large clusters
      (thousands of pods and above).
    - Improved SCTP reassembler support.
    - Fixed a bug related to LDAP protocol dissection.
    - Added OIDC with DEX integration for SSO authentication.
      Read more in our OIDC with DEX section.
      https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/oidc
    - Introduced a watchdog mechanism that terminates the Worker if
      it deems it non-functional. This feature is enabled by
      default and can be disabled using the Helm value: --set
      tap.watchdog.enabled=false
    - Added support for hosting Kubeshark behind a reverse proxy
      with a custom path.
      Read more in our Reverse Proxy with a Custom Path section.
