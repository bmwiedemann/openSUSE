- Update to version 52.7.8:
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Resolved a Make issue that caused the CLI to use an explicit
      tag (e.g., v52.3.77) instead of the latest tag (e.g., v52.3).
    - Reintroduced online support via Intercom. This can be
      disabled using: --set supportChatEnabled=false.
    - Fixed a panic related to the WebSocket (WS) protocol.
    - Added the ability to download an Agent logic script
      (JavaScript file). Once downloaded, the script can be used
      locally and managed via source control.

    - Fixed a bug where Kubeshark stopped processing traffic when
      Workers restarted (#1760).
    - Added an option to configure secrets to be read from
      environment variables, enabling the use of external secret
      managers for storing items such as licenses or SAML/OIDC
      secrets.
    - Updated Chart.yaml to use the full semantic version, ensuring
      the Helm chart is semver compliant (#1752).

Fri Apr 18 05:29:51 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 52.7.0:
  * Release Highlights
    This update adds new Helm options, improves GitOps
    compatibility, and enhances traffic capture with AF_PACKET. It
    also fixes bugs related to CLI exit, packet loss, Kafka
    crashes, and watchdog stability.
    Keywords: AF_PACKET, BPF, Dex, PVC, Kafka, Packet loss, Scripts
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Added support for tapping network interface traffic using
      AF_PACKET. This can be configured by entering a BPF
      expression (e.g., net 0.0.0.0/0) in the BPF OVERRIDE field in
      the Settings dialog. Useful when expected traffic is not
      being captured.
    - Added the Helm value tap.dashboard.completeStreamingEnabled,
      which sets the default mode for full (with payload) or
      partial (without payload) processing. This option can also be
      controlled from the dashboard.
    - Added the Helm value tap.auth.dexOidc.bypassSslCaCheck, which
      allows communication with a Dex IdP using an unknown SSL
      Certificate Authority, preventing SSL CA-related errors.
    - Added support for azure-csi-premium for RWX PVC volumes
      (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azuredisk-csi-driver/tree/master/deploy/example/sharedisk).
    - Disabled the online chat option by default.
    - Added support for a GitOps-friendly mode where dynamically
      changed configmap and secret values are preserved during Helm
      upgrades, avoiding CI/CD system overrides while Kubeshark is
      running.
    - Enabled the kubeshark CLI to use a proprietary configuration
      file.
    - Fixed a protocol matcher bug caused by packet loss (#1746).
    - Fixed a panic that occasionally occurred in the Kafka
      dissector.
    - Fixed a bug where the watchdog function could crash the
      Worker when no traffic was being processed on the node.
    - Fixed a bug in the kubeshark scripts command where it didn't
      exit properly upon receiving ^C.

Tue Mar 25 05:43:14 UTC 2025 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 52.6.0:
  In this release, we fixed several bugs and added notable
  integrations. Highlights include support for OIDC with DEX and
  the ability to host Kubeshark behind a reverse proxy using a
  custom path.
  * Bug Fixes & New Features
    - Optimized service map performance for large clusters
      (thousands of pods and above).
    - Improved SCTP reassembler support.
    - Fixed a bug related to LDAP protocol dissection.
    - Added OIDC with DEX integration for SSO authentication.
      Read more in our OIDC with DEX section.
      https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/oidc
    - Introduced a watchdog mechanism that terminates the Worker if
      it deems it non-functional. This feature is enabled by
      default and can be disabled using the Helm value: --set
      tap.watchdog.enabled=false
    - Added support for hosting Kubeshark behind a reverse proxy
      with a custom path.
      Read more in our Reverse Proxy with a Custom Path section.
