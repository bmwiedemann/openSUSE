  <title>Script for kdump</title>
  <description>kdump is a package that includes several scripts for kdump, including
the init script /etc/init.d/kdump and the configuration file for kdump.

The kernel package and this package are all that are required for a
crash dump to occur. However, if you wish to debug the crash dump
yourself you will need several debugging packages installed for each
kernel flavor and release you wish to debug.

For example, if you are debugging kernel-default, you will need:
- kernel-default-debuginfo
- kernel-default-devel
- kernel-default-devel-debuginfo

These packages are not needed to create the dump and can be installed
after a crash dump has occured.</description>
