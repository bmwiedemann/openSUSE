%description
I constantly found myself spinning up dummy pods to exec into them so I could
browse a PVC, this takes a few steps out of creating dummy pods to check out
the contents of a PVC.

Usage

`kubectl browse-pvc -n <namespace> <pvc-name>`

On an unbound PVC. The tool spins up a pod that mounts the PVC and then execs
into it allowing you to modify the contents of the PVC. The Job finishes and
cleans up the pod when you disconnect.
