  <title>An easy-to-use graphical application for generating images from LaTeX equations</title>
  <description>KLatexFormula is an easy-to-use graphical user interface for generating images
from LaTeX equations. These images can be dragged and dropped or copied and
pasted into external applications (presentations, text documents, graphics...),
or can be saved to disk in a variety of formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, EPS, PDF, etc.).

If package cm-unicode is installed, KLatexFormula can use LaTeX' Computer Modern
Sans Serif font as default application font.</description>
