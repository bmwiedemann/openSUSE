%description
kwctl is the go-to CLI tool for Kubewarden users.

Think of it as the docker CLI tool if you were working with containers.

As a policy author
- e2e testing of your policy. Test your policy against crafted Kubernetes
  requests, and ensure your policy behaves as you expect. You can even test
  context-aware policies, that require access to a running cluster.
- Embed metadata in your Wasm module, so the binary is annotated with the
  permissions it needs to execute.
- Publish policies to OCI registries.
- Generate initial ClusterAdmissionPolicy scaffolding for your policy.

As a cluster administrator
- Inspect remote policies. Given a policy in an OCI registry, or in an HTTP
  server, show all static information about the policy.
- Dry-run of a policy in your cluster. Test the policy against crafted
  Kubernetes requests, and ensure the policy behaves as you expect given the
  input data you provide. You can even test context-aware policies, that
  require access to a running cluster, also in a dry-run mode.
- Generate ClusterAdmissionPolicy scaffolding for a given policy.
