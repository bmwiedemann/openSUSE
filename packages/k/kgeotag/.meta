  <title>A photo geotagging utility</title>
  <description>KGeoTag is a standalone geotagging program.
Images can be associated with geographic coordinates
by different means: On the one hand, a matching with
GPX encoded geodata can be done, on the other hand,
the coordinates can be set manually, either via drag
and drop onto a map, via bookmarks or by manually
supplying them. The coordinates can be stored in the
images' Exif header and/or in XMP sidecar files.
