- Update to 1.1.0
  * Bugfix: When walking along a track, the date and time were
    displayed to be in the set timezone, but not actually converted
    to it. Now, the timestamps are translated correctly.
  * Enhancement: Added an "Assign images to GPS data" main menu
    entry. This one triggers an automatic image assignment af all
    loaded images, like "(Re)Assign all images" from the "Automatic
    assignment" dock. The search type to perform can be defined in
    the settings.
  * Bugfix: Enabled exact matching also if a used GPX track and/or
    the image metadata contain milliseconds. If so, the
    `QHash<QDateTime, ...>::contains()` call used to search for
    exact matches won't yield a result, even if there's a
    seconds-exact match (if not also the milliseconds matched, and
    this is quite unlikely).
