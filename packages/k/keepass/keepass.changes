    + As entry attachment icons, the icons associated with the respective file types (in the system settings) are used now.
    + When running on .NET 4.8 or higher, secure connections (e.g. for WebDAV) now support TLS 1.3.
    + Added keyboard shortcut Ctrl+* (numeric keypad) for the 'Expand Recursively' group command.
    + Added keyboard shortcut Ctrl+/ (numeric keypad) for the 'Collapse Recursively' group command.
    + Right-clicking on the header of the main entry list now shows the 'Configure Columns' command.

    + Added configuration option for protecting KeePass windows against certain screen capture operations.
    + Added command line parameter '-wa-enable:' for enabling specific Mono workarounds.
    + On Unix-like systems with a Wayland compositor, KeePass (with the KPUInput plugin) can now auto-type the default sequence and manually selected sequences of the currently selected entry.

    + Plugins: an I/O access event is now raised when checking the existence of a local database file.
    + In texts that are about to be displayed in a rich text box, U+FFFC characters are now replaced by question marks (in order to avoid the text being cut off at this point).
    + When running on Mono 5.10 or higher, a monospaced font is used in password text boxes by default again, as the Mono bug 5795 has been fixed.

  New Features:
  * Added main menu items 'Group', 'Entry' and 'Find', which contain all commands related to groups and entries (supersets of context menus); removed 'Edit' main menu item, because all of its commands are included in the three new main menu items.
  * Added support for a system-wide hot key to auto-type only the password of a matching entry; by default, the hot key is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A, changeable in the options dialog.
  * When double-clicking the URL cell of an entry in the main entry list while holding down the Shift key, KeePass now copies the URL to the clipboard (a double-click without Shift continues to open the URL; the option 'Copy URLs to clipboard instead of opening them' reverses this behavior).
  * Added quick edit commands 'Expires: Now' and 'Expires: Never'.
  * There now are two commands for copying a whole entry to the clipboard: 'Copy Entry (Encrypted)' and 'Copy Entry (Unencrypted)'; the first one encrypts the data for the current user using the Windows DPAPI.
  * Added Ctrl+Shift+P shortcut for printing the currently selected group.
  * The creation time and the last modification time of an entry are now displayed on the 'History' tab of the entry editing dialog.

  * Enhanced the Enpass import module to support TXT files created by version 6.0.4.
  * The language selection dialog now also lists KeePass 1.x LNG files; when trying to select such a file, an informative error message is displayed.
  * Added 'Cancel' command in the context menu of KeePass' system tray icon, which can be used to abort opening and saving a database file.
  * Added '-cancel' command line option, which causes all other KeePass instances to cancel opening/saving a database file.
  * Added '-auto-type-password' command line option (other running KeePass instances auto-type only the password of a matching entry).
  * Added '-e1:' command line parameter, which works like '-e:', but is handled by only one other instance; '-e:' is handled by all other instances.
  * When compiling a PLGX plugin, KeePass now defines a 'KP_V_*_*_*' symbol, where the asterisks specify the KeePass version (for example, 'KP_V_2_42_0' for version 2.42).
  * Added workarounds for .NET Caps Lock warning tooltip bug.
  * Added workaround for Mono grid view default color bug.

  * The pattern-based password generator now supports repeating escaped characters using '{...}'.
  * The pattern-based password generator now refuses to generate a password if the pattern is (partially) invalid.
  * Turning off the 'Unhide Passwords' policy now enforces hiding passwords in a few more places/situations.
  * New-line characters at the end of the output of a {CMD:...} placeholder are now removed (analogous to $(...) and `...` shell command substitutions).
  * The {URL:SCM} and {BASE:SCM} placeholders now work with arbitrary data having a ':'-terminated prefix.
  * Improved {URL:RMVSCM} and {BASE:RMVSCM} placeholders ('//' authority prefix is removed, but not '/').
  * The '-entry-url-open' command line option is now handled by all other KeePass instances (instead of only one).
  * Path traversal with attachment names is not possible anymore.
  * Removed the option 'Show tray icon only if main window has been sent to tray' from the options dialog (due to possible denial-of-service problems); if you want to hide the icon, it is recommended to configure this in the system settings instead.
  * Improved reading of KDBX XML documents with unknown elements.
  * Improved JSON parser.
  * Various UI text improvements.
  * Various code optimizations.
  * Improved menu item state updating.

- Update to 2.37
  New features:
  * When creating a new database, KeePass now offers to print a
    KeePass emergency sheet (which can then be filled out and
    stored in a secure location, where only the user and possibly

Tue Jan 12 16:06:07 UTC 2016 - t.gruner@katodev.de

- update to 2.31 (2016-01-09)
  - Added menu/toolbar styles, freely selectable in 'Tools' ->
    'Options' -> tab 'Interface'; available styles are 'Windows
    10', 'Windows 8.1', 'KeePass - Gradient', '.NET/Office -
    Professional' and 'System - Classic'; by default KeePass uses
    the style most similar to the one of the current operating
    system
  - Refined application icons (thanks to Victor Andreyenkov)
  - Auto-Type: new target window classification method, which
    improves compatibility with target windows hosted within
    other windows (e.g. a PuTTY window within SuperPuTTY/MTPuTTY)
  - Auto-Type: added workaround for the default Ctrl+Alt behavior
    of KiTTY variants (which differs from Windows' behavior)
  - Before clearing the clipboard, KeePass now first copies a
    non-sensitive text into it; this ensures that no sensitive
    information remains in the clipboard even when clearing is
    prevented by the environment (e.g. when running in a virtual
    machine, when using a clipboard extension utility, ...)
  - Added support for opening entry URLs with Internet Explorer
    or Google Chrome in private mode via the context menu ->
    'URL(s)' -> 'Open with ... (Private)'
  - Added URL override suggestions for Internet Explorer and
    Google Chrome in private mode in the URL override suggestions
    drop-down list in the entry dialog
  - Added optional built-in global URL overrides for opening
    HTTP/HTTPS URLs with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome in
    private mode
  - Added Ctrl+K shortcut for the 'Duplicate Entry' command
  - Mozilla Bookmarks HTML import: added support for importing
    tags
  - Added support for exporting to Mozilla Bookmarks HTML files
  - Windows/IE favorites export: entry fields are Spr-compiled
    now, and entries with cmd:// URLs are now exported as LNK
    files
  - HTML export/printing: added support for UUIDs, added
    horizontal lines between entries in details mode, added
    background color for group headings, long field names are
    hyphenated now, and long field data now breaks and wraps onto
    the next line
  - Plugins: added possibility to configure file transactions for
    each URI scheme
  - Plugins: added possibility to provide custom 'Save As'
    dialogs more easily
  - Converted some PNG images as a workaround for a problem in
    Cairo/LibPNG on Unix-like systems
  - As a workaround for a weakness in Mono's FileDialog, before
    showing such a dialog on Unix-like systems KeePass now tries
    to load the file '~/.recently-used' and deletes it, if it is
    not a valid XML file
  - KPScript: added support for specifying the master password in
    encrypted form using the '-pw-enc:' command line parameter
    (exactly like in KeePass, compatible with the {PASSWORD_ENC}
    placeholder)
  - KPScript: the 'Export' command now supports the optional
    '-GroupPath:' parameter (to export a specific group instead
    of the whole database)
  - KPScript: the 'GetEntryString' command now supports the
    '-FailIfNoEntry' option
  - KPScript: added '-refx-Expires' and '-refx-Expired' entry
    identification parameters
  - KPScript: the 'Import' command now prints more specific error
    messages
  - All KeePass program binaries are now dual signed using SHA-1
    and SHA-256
  
  - Auto-Type: improved keyboard layout handling when the target
    window changes during an auto-type process
  - Auto-Type: improved compatibility with Remote Desktop
    Connection client and VirtualBox
  - Improved icon recoloring
  - Improved printing of dates/times and tags
  - The password generator based on a character set now ensures
    that the generated password is Spr-invariant
  - Password generator based on a pattern or a custom algorithm:
    when a Spr-variant password is generated, a confirmation
    dialog for accepting this password is displayed
  - If the 'Save Database' policy prevents saving, the auto-save
    option is now ignored
  - Improved .NET Framework version detection
  - PLGX debugging: when the command line option '-debug' is
    passed and a PLGX plugin fails to compile, the output of all
    tried compilers is saved to a temporary file
  - Improved file transaction creation time handling on Unix-like
    systems
  - Improved compatibility with Mono on BSD systems
  - Enhanced PrepMonoDev.sh script for compatibility with Mono
    4.x
  - Removed KeePassLibSD sub-project (a KeePass library for
    Pocket PC / Windows Mobile) from the main solution
  - Upgraded installer
  - Various code optimizations
  - Minor other improvements
  
  - When running under Mono (Linux, Mac OS X, ...), two options
    related to window minimization are disabled now (because they
    do not work properly due to a Mono bug)

    override suggestions drop-down list in the entry dialog

    HTTP/HTTPS URLs with Microsoft Edge

    ensures that the group is visible in the group tree

    is restored outside all screens

    value reference elements
  - Plugins: added two auto-type sequence query events

    text box

    now disabled (because Mono doesn't implement the required
    events)
  - The installer now prevents running the installer while it is
    already running
  - KPScript: added '-GroupPath:' parameter (for specifying the
    full path of a group)

    '-GroupName:' parameter (as alternative to '-GroupPath:')

    default

    after pressing Ctrl+H or Ctrl+J
  - The KDB import module now tries to round any invalid
    date/time to the nearest valid date/time
  - XML serializers are now loaded/created at KeePass startup in
    order to avoid a problem when shutting down Windows and
    KeePass.XmlSerializers.dll not being present
  - Changed tab bar behavior in the options dialog to avoid a tab
    content cropping issue caused by plugins
  - Improved workaround for Mono splitter bug
  - Upgraded installer
