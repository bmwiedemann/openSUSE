  * Added support for a system-wide hot key to auto-type only the password of a matching entry; by default, the hot key is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A, changeable in the options dialog.
  * When double-clicking the URL cell of an entry in the main entry list while holding down the Shift key, KeePass now copies the URL to the clipboard (a double-click without Shift continues to open the URL; the option 'Copy URLs to clipboard instead of opening them' reverses this behavior).
  * Added quick edit commands 'Expires: Now' and 'Expires: Never'.
  * There now are two commands for copying a whole entry to the clipboard: 'Copy Entry (Encrypted)' and 'Copy Entry (Unencrypted)'; the first one encrypts the data for the current user using the Windows DPAPI.

  * The language selection dialog now also lists KeePass 1.x LNG files; when trying to select such a file, an informative error message is displayed.
  * Added 'Cancel' command in the context menu of KeePass' system tray icon, which can be used to abort opening and saving a database file.
  * Added '-cancel' command line option, which causes all other KeePass instances to cancel opening/saving a database file.
  * Added '-auto-type-password' command line option (other running KeePass instances auto-type only the password of a matching entry).
  * Added '-e1:' command line parameter, which works like '-e:', but is handled by only one other instance; '-e:' is handled by all other instances.
  * When compiling a PLGX plugin, KeePass now defines a 'KP_V_*_*_*' symbol, where the asterisks specify the KeePass version (for example, 'KP_V_2_42_0' for version 2.42).
  * Added workarounds for .NET Caps Lock warning tooltip bug.

  * The pattern-based password generator now refuses to generate a password if the pattern is (partially) invalid.
  * Turning off the 'Unhide Passwords' policy now enforces hiding passwords in a few more places/situations.
  * New-line characters at the end of the output of a {CMD:...} placeholder are now removed (analogous to $(...) and `...` shell command substitutions).
  * The {URL:SCM} and {BASE:SCM} placeholders now work with arbitrary data having a ':'-terminated prefix.
  * Improved {URL:RMVSCM} and {BASE:RMVSCM} placeholders ('//' authority prefix is removed, but not '/').
  * The '-entry-url-open' command line option is now handled by all other KeePass instances (instead of only one).
  * Path traversal with attachment names is not possible anymore.
  * Removed the option 'Show tray icon only if main window has been sent to tray' from the options dialog (due to possible denial-of-service problems); if you want to hide the icon, it is recommended to configure this in the system settings instead.
  * Improved reading of KDBX XML documents with unknown elements.

- Update to 2.40
New Features:

- Update to 2.39
  New features
  * KeePass now uses Transactional NTFS (TxF) for writing database

  * The trigger system now ignores state-changing placeholders in most places.
  * Removed trigger event 'User interface state updated'
    (consider using the new event 'Time - Periodic' instead).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 14:14:49 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 2.37
  New features:
  * When creating a new database, KeePass now offers to print a
    KeePass emergency sheet (which can then be filled out and
    stored in a secure location, where only the user and possibly
    a few other people that the user trusts have access to);

  * Added database file information dialog that is displayed
    when creating a new database.
  * Added function to search similar password clusters
   ('Edit' -> 'Show Entries' -> 'Find Similar Passwords (Clusters)').
  * On Unix-like systems: if the library 'libgcrypt.so.20' is
    available, KeePass uses it for AES-KDF transformations.

    when switching to TAN-only entry list mode.
  * Added workaround for Mono tab switching bug.

    changing the master key, and it asks whether to print a
    new emergency sheet.
  * Various improvements in the translation selection dialog

    of the AES algorithm for encrypting data, which is a bit faster.
  * Improved tool strip checkmark rendering on Unix-like systems.

- update to 2.31 (2016-01-09)
  - Added menu/toolbar styles, freely selectable in 'Tools' ->
    'Options' -> tab 'Interface'; available styles are 'Windows
    10', 'Windows 8.1', 'KeePass - Gradient', '.NET/Office -
    Professional' and 'System - Classic'; by default KeePass uses
    the style most similar to the one of the current operating
    system
  - Refined application icons (thanks to Victor Andreyenkov)
  - Auto-Type: new target window classification method, which
    improves compatibility with target windows hosted within
    other windows (e.g. a PuTTY window within SuperPuTTY/MTPuTTY)
  - Auto-Type: added workaround for the default Ctrl+Alt behavior
    of KiTTY variants (which differs from Windows' behavior)
  - Before clearing the clipboard, KeePass now first copies a
    non-sensitive text into it; this ensures that no sensitive
    information remains in the clipboard even when clearing is
    prevented by the environment (e.g. when running in a virtual
    machine, when using a clipboard extension utility, ...)
  - Added support for opening entry URLs with Internet Explorer
    or Google Chrome in private mode via the context menu ->
    'URL(s)' -> 'Open with ... (Private)'

  - Mozilla Bookmarks HTML import: added support for importing
    tags
  - Added support for exporting to Mozilla Bookmarks HTML files
  - Windows/IE favorites export: entry fields are Spr-compiled
    now, and entries with cmd:// URLs are now exported as LNK
    files
  - HTML export/printing: added support for UUIDs, added

    hyphenated now, and long field data now breaks and wraps onto
    the next line
  - Plugins: added possibility to configure file transactions for
    each URI scheme
  - Plugins: added possibility to provide custom 'Save As'
    dialogs more easily
  - Converted some PNG images as a workaround for a problem in
    Cairo/LibPNG on Unix-like systems
  - As a workaround for a weakness in Mono's FileDialog, before
    showing such a dialog on Unix-like systems KeePass now tries
    to load the file '~/.recently-used' and deletes it, if it is
    not a valid XML file
  - KPScript: added support for specifying the master password in
    encrypted form using the '-pw-enc:' command line parameter
    (exactly like in KeePass, compatible with the {PASSWORD_ENC}
    placeholder)
  - KPScript: the 'Export' command now supports the optional
    '-GroupPath:' parameter (to export a specific group instead
    of the whole database)
  - KPScript: the 'GetEntryString' command now supports the
    '-FailIfNoEntry' option

    window changes during an auto-type process
  - Auto-Type: improved compatibility with Remote Desktop
    Connection client and VirtualBox
  - Improved icon recoloring
  - Improved printing of dates/times and tags
  - The password generator based on a character set now ensures
    that the generated password is Spr-invariant
  - Password generator based on a pattern or a custom algorithm:
    when a Spr-variant password is generated, a confirmation
    dialog for accepting this password is displayed
  - If the 'Save Database' policy prevents saving, the auto-save
    option is now ignored
  - Improved .NET Framework version detection
  - PLGX debugging: when the command line option '-debug' is
    passed and a PLGX plugin fails to compile, the output of all
    tried compilers is saved to a temporary file
  - Improved file transaction creation time handling on Unix-like
    systems
  - Improved compatibility with Mono on BSD systems
  - Enhanced PrepMonoDev.sh script for compatibility with Mono
    4.x
  - Removed KeePassLibSD sub-project (a KeePass library for
    Pocket PC / Windows Mobile) from the main solution
  - Upgraded installer
  - Various code optimizations
  - Minor other improvements
  
  - When running under Mono (Linux, Mac OS X, ...), two options
    related to window minimization are disabled now (because they
    do not work properly due to a Mono bug)
