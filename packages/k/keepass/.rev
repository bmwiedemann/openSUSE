    <comment>- Update to 2.37
  New features:
  * When creating a new database, KeePass now offers to print a
    KeePass emergency sheet (which can then be filled out and
    stored in a secure location, where only the user and possibly
    a few other people that the user trusts have access to);
    an emergency sheet can also be created via 
    'Tools' -&gt; 'Database Tools' -&gt; 'Print Emergency Sheet'.
  * Added database file information dialog that is displayed
    when creating a new database.
  * Added function to search similar password clusters
   ('Edit' -&gt; 'Show Entries' -&gt; 'Find Similar Passwords (Clusters)').
  * On Unix-like systems: if the library 'libgcrypt.so.20' is
    available, KeePass uses it for AES-KDF transformations.
  * Added workaround for .NET/Windows column header drawing bug
    when switching to TAN-only entry list mode.
  * Added workaround for Mono tab switching bug.
  * Added workaround for Mono '}' character RTF encoding bug.
  * TrlUtil: added support for .NET 4.*.
  
  Improvements:
  * Improved dialog for changing the master key
  * KeePass now directly offers to save the database after
    changing the master key, and it asks whether to print a
    new emergency sheet.
  * Various improvements in the translation selection dialog
  * KeePass now refuses to attach files that are larger than
    512 MB (as larger files can result in serialization problems).
  * Increased default number of AES-KDF rounds.
  * On Unix-like systems, KeePass now uses the CSP implementation</comment>

    which opens the 'Languages' folder.
  * Added button 'Open Folder' in the plugins dialog,
    which opens the 'Plugins' folder.
  * Added option 'Icon' and an option for specifying the placeholder
    behavior (replace or not, or both forms) in the 'Print' / HTML
    export dialog.
  * Printing / HTML export: the notes of a group are now displayed
    below the group name.
  * Enhanced the Password Exporter import module to support XML
    files created by version 1.3.4.
  * Added workaround for Mono list view item deletion bug.
  * Added workaround for Mono command line argument encoding bug.
  Improvements:
  * Password quality estimation: improved compatibility with
    process memory protection.
  * Improved UI scaling when using KeePass on multiple systems
    with different DPI values.
  * Printing / HTML export: improved embedding of CSS.
  * Printing / HTML export: spaces in passwords are now encoded
    as non-breaking spaces.
  * Improved UI updating in the 'Print' / HTML export dialog.
  * Enhanced KDE system font detection.
  * Improved fatal error handling.
  * Various improvements in the language selection dialog.
  * Various code optimizations.
  * Minor other improvements.

    <comment>- Update to 2.39
  New features
  * KeePass now uses Transactional NTFS (TxF) for writing database
    and configuration files, if possible; this improves the
    compatibility with other programs that are watching these
    files (e.g. file synchronization services).
  * Added command 'Edit' → 'Show Entries' → 'Large Entries'.
  * Added command 'Edit' → 'Show Entries' → 'Last Modified Entries'.
  * Added option 'Automatically save after modifying an entry
    using the entry editing dialog' (turned off by default).
  * Added option 'Minimize main window after performing auto-type'
    (turned off by default).
  * Added option 'Show lines between nodes in tree views'
    (turned off by default).
  * Added support for importing Google Chrome 66 password CSV files.
  * Added trigger event 'Time - Periodic', which is raised at
    user-defined intervals.
  * Links in the entry string editing dialog are clickable now.
  * Added UIFlags bit for disabling the 'XML Replace' menu item.
  * Added UIFlags bit for hiding auto-type obfuscation
    compatibility information dialogs.
  * Added workaround for .NET 'urtf' RTF round-trip bug.
  * Secure edit controls are now extensible by plugins.
  * KPScript: the 'AddEntry' command now supports the
    '-setx-Expires' and '-setx-ExpiryTime' parameters.
 
  Improvements
  * In printouts and HTML exports, expired entries now have a red
    'X' icon (if the option 'Icon' is turned on).
  * Improved string normalization in the entry and string editing dialogs.</comment>

    + In the 'Find' dialog, search parameters can now be saved as profiles; the profiles can be accessed quickly via the main menu ('Find' → 'Search Profiles') and the group context menu.
    + Added search mode 'XPath expression' in the 'Find' dialog, which creates a KeePass 2.x XML DOM of the current database in memory and finds entries using the specified XPath expression.
    + Added option 'History' in the 'Find' dialog, which includes history entries in searches.
    + Added 'Help' button in the 'Find' dialog.
    + Added auto-type matching option 'Consider similar dashes as identical' (in 'Tools' → 'Options' → tab 'Advanced', turned on by default).
    + Added commands 'Copy Group (Encrypted)', 'Copy Group (Unencrypted)' and 'Paste Group' (in the menu 'Group' → 'Data Exchange').
    + When loading/saving a configuration file fails, an error message is displayed now, and in certain cases a backup of the configuration file is created (the path is mentioned in the error message).
    + Added configuration option for saving the configuration (turned on by default).
    + On the 'Security' tab page of the options dialog, two links have been added, which open help pages for experts and administrators.
    + Added {TIMEOTP} placeholder, which generates a time-based one-time password (as specified in RFC 6238).
    + Enhanced XML key file format (added hash that allows to verify the integrity of the key; values are now encoded using hexadecimal characters in order to improve the readability).
    + Added command 'Print Key File Backup' (in 'File' → 'Print').
    + In the dialog that asks whether to print an emergency sheet, there is now an option 'Also print a key file backup' (on Windows), if the master key contains a key file.
    + Added command 'Create Key File' (in 'Tools' → 'Advanced Tools'), which shows a dialog for creating a new key file (random key) or for recreating a key file from a printed backup.
    + Added Argon2id key derivation function.

    + If the password quality estimation is disabled for an entry, the entry is now excluded from password quality reports (menu 'Find' → 'Password Quality').
    + When moving an entry/group into a different group (e.g. into the recycle bin), the previous parent group is remembered now (KDBX 4.1, not enforcing).
    + Added command 'Move to Previous Parent Group' (in the 'Rearrange' popup menu; if the command will move all selected entries/groups out of the recycle bin, a '(Restore)' suffix is appended to the command name; if at least one entry/group will be moved into/within the recycle bin, a confirmation dialog is displayed).
    + Renaming a list view item (if supported, e.g. a file attached to an entry) can now be initiated by pressing the F2 key.
    + Each custom icon may now have a name, and its last modification time is remembered (KDBX 4.1).

    + In the icon picker dialog, the dimensions and the size of a custom icon are now displayed in a tooltip.
    + The UUID and the deletion time of a deleted custom icon are remembered now, and this information is used in order to delete the custom icon during a synchronization (if the last modification time is older than the deletion time).
    + Added built-in URL override for associating the 'ssh' URL scheme with 'SSH.exe' (OpenSSH, included in Windows 10; activatable/deactivatable in 'Tools' → 'Options' → tab 'Integration' → button 'URL Overrides').
    + Added support for loading images with Exif orientation tags.

    + Added option 'Alt. item background color' (supporting the states 'Off', 'On, default color' and 'On, custom color'); this combines the previous two options 'Use alternating item background colors' and 'Custom alt. item color'.
    + Comment placeholders ({C:...}) may now contain balanced braces.
    + In the auto-type entry selection dialog, values in the 'Sequence - Comments' column are dereferenced now.

    + Unified creation of fields with indices.
    + Improved database modification state and UI updating after imports/synchronizations.
    + In the master key creation/prompt dialogs, the [OK] button is now disabled when checking the 'Key file/provider' check box and selecting '(None)' in the combo box.

  * New Features:
    + For each entry listed on the 'History' tab page of the entry dialog, the fields modified with respect to the previous entry are displayed.
    + Added 'Compare' button on the 'History' tab page of the entry dialog; when two (not necessarily consecutive) history entries are selected, clicking the button shows a detailed comparison (with values, etc.).
    + When editing an entry, the history entry list of the entry dialog now contains an entry called 'Dialog (unsaved)', which represents all data entered in the current dialog (other tab pages).
    + When editing an entry, the history entry list of the entry dialog now contains an entry called 'Current (TIME)', which is the entry that is currently stored in the database (without any changes made in the current dialog).
    + Added 'History' command in the 'Find' main menu; it lists all entry modifications (sorted by time).
