Sat Jul 13 07:32:46 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.2.0-1
  New Features:
  * When using libmpv, it is possible to show transparent
    widgets (ie playlist, titlelist, control frame etc..)
    directly on video. This property is available in
    Preferences->Appearance->Widgets on video.
  * In dark theme, users can manually change color of background
    and control frame. Few combinations are available by default
    Preferences->Appearance->Try. Users can choose any color,
    but most likely only dark shade of any color may look good
    on this theme (along with bold fonts).
  * Added Playlist Continue option in Preferences->Player
  Bug fixes and modifications:
  * fixed: cache pause seconds option when using libmpv
  * fixed: irregular global font size by fixing stylesheet
  * It is possible to pass http headers as dictionary to ccurl
    function
  * No need to restart the application whenever changing mpv
    config options from Preferences, when using libmpv.
    (However, changing some options like vo/ao may need
    restart)
  Feature removal:
  * Setting external player from Preferences has been removed.
    Option is still available, but user will need to manually
    edit the config files.
  * Music mode deprecated. As one can use detached video mode as
    music mode, the music mode somewhat became irrelevant.
    Moreover it became buggy and difficult to maintain over the
    time.

Mon Jun 17 18:53:42 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.1.0-1
  New Features:
  * Thumbnail wall mode now applicable for both titlelist and
    playlist. (Thumbnail wall mode is lighter and faster
    compared to regular thumbnail grid mode, press F1 to switch
    to this mode).
  * Change number of thumbnails in each row using keys - and =
  * automatic resizing of thumbnails in thumbnail wall mode on
    widget resize
  Bug fixes:
  * Fixed: constant reappearance of cursor after fixed duration
    (in full-screen mode) on linux
  * Fixed: UI lock when libmpv could not generate
    thumbnails/preview due to corrupted file
  * Fixed: Automatic subtitle loading in pc-to-pc casting mode
    when using libmpv
  * Fixed: Maximum recursion depth limit error when window title
    is not available
  * Fixed: UnicodeEncodeError when sending playlist in pc-to-pc
    casting mode from master to slave
  * Multiple bug-fixes when using libmpv backend
  Modifications and improvements:
  * Allow setting timeout in wait_for_property
  * Generate new tokens for every playlist, when sending items
    from master to slave in pc-to-pc casting mode
  * Allow adding external audio by using command
    add-external-audio. Add keyboard shortcut to this command in
    the Shortcuts settings.

Sat May 25 07:58:41 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 4.0.0-1
  New Features:
  * Experimental support for directly using libmpv as backend,
    instead of binary.
  * For generating preview and thumbnails, libmpv will be used
    by default.
  * Automatically prevent screen turn off or screensaver when
    playing video.
  * Removed variable_width_list property, since it is not
    required now. Application will automatically resize widgets
    when screen changes, on dual monitor/screen setup, even if
    application is placed on non-primary screen.
  * Added Device Pixel Ratio property in preferences. By default
    it is set to 1.0. For high resolution displays, it will be
    greater that 1.0. For retina displays it is 2.0. If video is
    appearing smaller then increase this value, when using libmpv
    as backend. If not sure, set it to 0.0, and application will
    try to adjust this value automatically.
  * Support added for both opengl-cb and opengl-render api of
    libmpv.
  * Accurate live preview and improved gapless playback of
    network streams when using libmpv
  New Dependencies (names are given as per PyPI packages):
  * PyOpenGL
  * PyQtWebEngine (This is separate package now and won't be
    included in default PyQt5 installation)
  Optional dependency:
  * pympv (If user wants to use latest opengl-render api of
    libmpv)
  Use of libmpv with kawaii-player:
  * python-mpv package, written by github user jaseg, with minor
    modifications. No need to install it separately. The main
    file with minor modifications is included in the
    kawaii-player.
  * pympv. This package is optional and needs to be installed
    from PyPI, if user wants to use latest rendering api of mpv.
  Notes:
  * Those who want to use mpv/mplayer binaries, they can still
    use it. Support for binary mpv/mplayer won't be deprecated in
    the application. Advantage of using libmpv (apart from making
    cleaner code) is that, it will make application work better
    and uniform across all platforms (gnu/linux, windows and mac).
  * Playing video within thumbnails, won't work with libmpv as
    of now. So this feature has been disabled for libmpv, but it
    works as usual when using mpv binary.
