  <title>Kernel with PAE Support</title>
  <description>This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
&quot;no execute&quot; feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.</description>
