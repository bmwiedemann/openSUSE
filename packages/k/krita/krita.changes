-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  2 15:57:09 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- BuildConflict on python3-sip-devel >= 6 because the build expects
  the sip5 executable (or even older sip from SIP v4), which was
  removed in SIP v6. A simple BuildRequire python3-sip-devel < 6
  would result in a parallel install of SIPv4 and SIPv6, which do
  not conflict per se.  Because CMake sees the SIPv6 modules, it
  assumes sip5 to be present, does not look for the old sip command
  and fails.

- Update to 4.1.3: (4.1.2 has been skipped)
  * See https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-1-3-released/
  * Add a workaround for loading broken files with negative frame
    ids (kde#395378)
  * Delete existing frame files only within exported range
    (kde#377354)
  * Fix a problem of Insert Hold Frames action. We should also
    "offset" empty cell to make sure the expanding works correctly.
    (kde#396848)
  * Fix an assert when trying to export a PNG image sequence
    (kde#398608)
  * Fix updates when switching frame on a layer with scalar channel
  * Use user-selected color label for the auto-created animation
    frames (kde#394072)

    config
  * Improvements to support for various file formats
  * Fix an assert if an imported SVG file links to non-existent
    color profile (kde#398576)
  * Fix backward compatibility of adjustment curves. Older versions
    supported fewer adjustable channels, so we can no longer assume
    the count in configuration data to matches exactly. (kde#396625)
  * Fix saving layers with layer styles (kde#396224)
  * Let Krita save all the kinds of layers into PSD (in rasterized way)
    (kde#399002)

    (kde#398241)
  * Remove fax-related tiff options. In fax mode tiff can store
    only 1 bit per channel images, which Krita doesn't support. So
    just remove these options from the GUI (kde#398548)
  * Add a shortcut for the threshold filter (kde#383818)
  * Fix Burn filter to work in 16-bit color space (kde#387102)
  * Make color difference threshold for color labels higher

    subtree walker
  * a spurious assert in layer cloning (kde#398788)
  * Fix a memory access problem in KisExifIO
  * Fix memory access problems in KisExifIo
  * Show metadata in the dublin core page of the metadata editor.
    The editor plugin is still broken, with dates not working,
    bools not working, but now at least a string one has entered
    is shown again. (kde#396672)
  * SegFault in LibKis Node mergeDown (kde#397043)

    selection
  * Fix crash when undoing removing of a selection mask
  * Fix rounded rectangular selection to actually work (kde#397806)
  * Fix selection default bounds when loading old type of
    adjustment layers
  * Stroke Selection: don't try to add a shape just because a
    layer doesn't have a paint device (kde#398015)
  * Fix color picking from reference images. Desaturation now
    affects the picked color, and reference images are ignored for
    picking if hidden.
  * Fix connection points on cage transform (kde#396788)
  * Fix minor UIX issues in the move tool:
    1) adds an explicit frame when the move stroke is in progress
    2) Ctrl+Z now cancels the stroke if there is nothing to undo
    (kde#392014)
  * Fix offset in Move Tool in the end of the drag
  * Fix shift modifier in Curve Selection Tool. The modifier of the
    point clicked the last should define the selection mode. For
    selection tools we just disable shift+click "path-close"
    shortcut of the base path tool. (kde#397932)
  * Move tool crops the bounding area by exact bounds
  * Reduce aliasing in reference images (kde#396257)

    (kde#396948)
  * Fix http link color in KritaBlender.colors: The link are now
    visible on the startup page of Krita and were dark blue, exact
    same value as the background making the frame hard to read.
    Switching them to bright cyan improves the situation.
  * Fix loading the template icons
  * Fix the offset dialog giving inaccurate offsets (kde#397218)
  * Make color label selector handle mouse release events (kde#394072)
  * Remember the last opened settings page in the preferences dialog
  * Remember the last used filter bookmark
  * Remove the shortcut for wraparound mode: It's still available
    from the menu and could be put on the toolbar, or people could
    assign a shortcut, but having it on by default makes life too
    hard for people who are trying to support our users.
  * Remove the shortcuts from the mdi window's system menu's
    actions. The Close Window action can now have a custom shortcut,
    and there are no conflicts with hidden actions any more.
    (kde#398729, kde#375524, kde#352205)
  * Set color scheme hint for compositor. This is picked up by KWin
    and sets the palette on the decoration and window frame,
    ensuring a unified look.
  * Show a canvas message when entering wraparound mode
  * Show the zoom widget when switching documents (kde#398099)
  * Use KSqueezedTextLabel for the pattern name in the pattern
    docker and brush editor (kde#398958)

- Recommend python3-qt5, required for python scripting
- BuildRequire python3-sip-devel instead of python3-sip, the former
  is needed for *building* (though it makes no difference in
  practice as both are pulled in by python3-qt5-devel anyway)
- Don't delete libkritacolord.so, we should not have to worry about
  a conflict with calligra-krita anymore
- Mark license files as %license instead of %doc

Thu Sep 28 08:55:33 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 3.3.0:
  * Some visual glitches when using hi-dpi screens are fixed
    (remember: on Windows and Linux, you need to enable this in the
    settings dialog).
  * If you create a new image from clipboard, the image will have a
    title
  * Favorite blending modes and favorite brush presets are now
    loaded correctly on startup
  * GMIC
    + the plugin has been updated to the latest version for Windows
      and Linux.
    + the configuration for setting the path to the plugin has been
      removed. Krita looks for the plugin in the folder where the
      krita executable is, and optionally inside a folder with a
      name that starts with ‘gmic’ next to the krita executable.
    + there are several fixes for handling layers and communication
      between Krita and the plugin
  * Some websites save jpeg images with a .png extension: that used
    to confuse Krita, but Krita now first looks inside the file to
    see what kind of file it really is.
  * PNG: 
    + 16 and 32 bit floating point images are now converted to 16
      bit integer when saving the images as PNG.
    + It’s now possible to save the alpha channel to PNG images
      even if there are no (semi-) transparent pixels in the image
  * When hardware accelerated display is disabled, the color picker
    mode of the brush tool showed a broken cursor; this has been
    fixed.
  * The Reference Images docker now only starts loading images when
    it is visible, instead on Krita startup. Note: the reference
    images docker uses Qt’s imageio plugins to load images. If you
    are running on Linux, remove all Deepin desktop components.
    Deepin comes with severely broken qimageio plugins that will
    crash any Qt application that tries to display images.
  * File layers now correctly reload on change again
  * Add several new commandline options: 
    + –nosplash to start Krita without showing the splash screen
    + –canvasonly to start Krita in canvas-only mode
    + –fullscreen to start Krita full-screen
    + –workspace Workspace to start Krita with the given workspace
  * Selections 
    + The Select All action now first clears the selection before
      selecting the entire image
    + It is now possible to extend selections outside the canvas
      boundary
  * Performance improvements: in several places superfluous reads
    from the settings were eliminated, which makes generating a layer
    thumbnail faster and improves painting if display acceleration is
    turned off.
  * The smart number input boxes now use the current locale to follow
    desktop settings for numbers
  * The system information dialog for bug reports is improved
  * See also https://krita.org/en/item/krita-3-3-0/

Fri Aug 25 12:46:36 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

  * A bug where gmic-qt could crash on odd-sized images
  * A regression where using the text tool would break the brush tool
  * The option to use the native platform’s file dialogs was restored
  * A bug where selecting the line tool would disable the flow slider
  * Some issues with the LUT docker were fixed

    to render to doesn't exist
  * Don't open the tablet/screen resolution conflict dialog
    multiple times
  * Don't scale down previews that are too small in the transform
    tool: this fixes a rare crash with the transform tool
  * Don't crash when trying to close the last view on the last
    document while the document is modified.
  * Fix a crash when cycling quickly through layers that have a
    color tag
  * Fix loading some Gimp 2.9 files: note that Gimp 2.9's file
    format is not officially supported in Krita
  * Fully remove the macro recorder plugin: in 3.1.4, only the
    menu entries had stayed around.
  * Make it impossible to hide the template selector in the new
    image dialog; hiding the template selector would also hide the
    cancel button in the dialog.
