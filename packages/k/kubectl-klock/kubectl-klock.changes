- Update to version 0.8.1:
  * Fix ANSI coloring issue (#159)
    Issue was that kubectl-klock always converted to (what it
    thought was the correct) RGB version of the kubecolor color.
    But the kubecolor color may use ANSI color codes that can be
    changed via the terminal emulator's theme settings, whereas RGB
    versions are not changed to fit the terminal emulator theme.
    With this change kubectl-klock will preseve the ANSI color
    codes correctly.
    Screenshots see

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  * New features
    - Auto-hide deleted after duration by @applejag in #154
      This adds a new flag --hide-deleted, which can be set to
      either a time duration (e.g 10s, 1m, but also supports
      additional units like 1d, 1w, not that it's super useful in
      this case... )
      When set, deleted rows will disappear after this duration.
      * To always hide deleted rows you can pass
        --hide-deleted=true.
      * To revert back to v0.7.2's behavior of always showing
        deleted rows, pass --hide-deleted=false
      This includes a "behavioral breaking change ⚠️" as
      --hide-deleted is by default set to 10s
    - Added environment variables support by @applejag in #154
      I always had some plumbing in kubectl-klock for using
      environment variables. But they never worked as intended, so
      it was never a supported use case. But now they do!
      Command-line flags can now be controlled via environment
      variables:
        export KLOCK_ALL_NAMESPACES="true"                     # --all-namespaces
        export KLOCK_FIELD_SELECTOR="status.phase!=Succeeded"  # --field-separator
        export KLOCK_HIDE_DELETED="false"                      # --hide-deleted
        export KLOCK_LABEL_COLUMNS="app.kubernetes.io/name"    # --label-columns
        export KLOCK_OUTPUT="wide"                             # --output
        export KLOCK_SELECTOR="team!=frontend"                 # --selector
        export KLOCK_WATCH_KUBECONFIG="true"                   # --watch-kubeconfig
      The command-line flags have precedense over the environment
      variables. So if you set KLOCK_ALL_NAMESPACES=true then you
      can revert the value by passing the flag
      --all-namespaces=false
    - Use kubecolor coloring by @applejag in #150
      Now making use of kubecolor's table and help text coloring!
      This includes using kubecolor's ~/.kube/color.yaml config.
      For more information about kubecolor theme customization,
      see: https://kubecolor.github.io/customizing/themes/
    - Added options subcommand & hide "common flags" from kubectl
      klock --help by @applejag in #156
      This, together with the kubecolor help text coloring, makes
      kubectl klock --help much more readable.
      Help text for the "standard command-line flags" like --as,
      --context, --kubeconfig, --token, etc have been moved to the
      options subcommand.
  * Changes
    - Changed d hotkey to show deleted rows instead of hiding by
      @applejag in #154
      With the addition on --hide-deleted flag, the d hotkey has
      been changed from "hide deleted rows" to "show hidden deleted
      rows".
  * Bug fixes
    - Fix --context flag completion by @applejag in #153
  * Dependencies
    - In summary, kubectl-klock is now built using Go 1.24.3 and
      using Kubernetes libraries for Kubernetes v1.33.1.

  * Non-functional changes
    - Removed VERSION file in favor of automatic version detection

      I've also removed the CHANGELOG.md in favor of the notes I
      write here in GitHub releases. If you relied on that before,
      then I'm sorry for the inconvinience. But this improves
      maintainability for me.
    - Added build attestations by @applejag in #152
      Since this version you should be able to verify that release
      assets are built by me by running:
        gh attestation verify ./kubectl-klock_linux_amd64.tar.gz --repo applejag/kubectl-klock
    - Fixed goreleaser config warnings by @applejag in #155
