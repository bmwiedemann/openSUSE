- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * k6 v1.6.0 is here! This release includes:
    - Cloud commands now support configurable default Grafana Cloud
      stack.
    - New k6 deps command for analyzing script dependencies.
    - Browser APIs enhancements with frameLocator(), goBack(),
      goForward() methods.
    - Crypto module adds PBKDF2 support for password-based key
      derivation.
    - jslib gets a new TOTP library for time-based one-time
      password generation and validation.
    - New mcp-k6 MCP server for AI-assisted k6 script writing.
  * Breaking changes
    - There are no breaking changes in this release.
  * New features
    - Configurable default stack for Cloud commands #5420
      Cloud commands now support configuring the default Grafana
      Cloud stack you want to use. The stack slug (or stack id) is
      used by the Cloud to determine which default project to use
      when not explicitly provided.
      Previously, users had to specify the project id for every
      test run. With this change, you can configure a default stack
      during login, and k6 will use it to automatically resolve the
      appropriate default project. This is particularly useful for
      organizations with multiple Grafana Cloud stacks or when
      working across different teams and environments.
      Users can also set up a specific stack for every test run,
      either using the new option stackID or the environment
      variable K6_CLOUD_STACK_ID.
      Please note that, in k6 v2, this stack information will
      become mandatory to run a test.

        # Login interactively and select default stack
        k6 cloud login

        # Login and set default stack with token
        k6 cloud login --token $MY_TOKEN --stack my-stack-slug

        # Run test using the configured default stack
        k6 cloud run script.js

        # Run test using a specific stack
        K6_CLOUD_STACK_ID=12345 k6 cloud run script.js

        # Stack id can also be set in the options
        export const options = {
          cloud: {
            stackID: 123,
            projectID: 789,  // If the project does not belong to the stack, this will throw an error
          },
        };

      This simplifies the cloud testing workflow and prepares k6
      for upcoming changes to the Grafana Cloud k6 authentication
      process, where the stack will eventually become mandatory.
    - k6 deps command and manifest support #5410, #5427
      A new k6 deps command is now available to analyze and list
      all dependencies of a given script or archive. This is
      particularly useful for understanding which extensions are
      required to run a script, especially when using auto
      extension resolution.
      The command identifies all imports in your script and lists
      dependencies that might be needed for building a new binary
      with auto extension resolution. Like auto extension
      resolution itself, this only accounts for imports, not
      dynamic require() calls.

        # Analyze script dependencies
        k6 deps script.js

        # Output in JSON format for programmatic consumption
        k6 deps --json script.js

        # Analyze archived test dependencies
        k6 deps archive.tar

      This makes it easier to understand extension requirements,
      share scripts with clear dependency information, and
      integrate k6 into automated build pipelines.
      In addition, k6 now supports a manifest that specifies
      default version constraints for dependencies when no version
      is defined in the script using pragmas. If a dependency is
      imported without an explicit version, it defaults to "*", and
      the manifest can be used to replace that with a concrete
      version constraint.
      The manifest is set through an environment variable as JSON
      with keys being a dependency and values being constraints:

        K6_DEPENDENCIES_MANIFEST='{"k6/x/faker": ">=v0.4.4"}' k6 run scripts.js

      In this example, if the script only imports k6/x/faker and
      does not use a use k6 with k6/x/faker ... directive, it will
      set the version constraint to >=v0.4.4. It will not make any
      changes if k6/x/faker is not a dependency of the script at
      all.
    - Browser module: frameLocator() method #5487
      The browser module now supports frameLocator() on Page,
      Frame, Locator, and FrameLocator objects. This method creates
      a locator for working with iframe elements without the need
      to explicitly switch contexts, making it much easier to
      interact with embedded content.
      Frame locators are particularly valuable when testing
      applications with nested iframes, as they allow you to chain
      locators naturally while maintaining readability:

      (example code see the release)

      This complements existing frame handling methods and provides
      a more intuitive API for working with iframe-heavy
      applications.
    - Browser module: goBack() and goForward() navigation methods #5494
      The browser module now supports page.goBack() and
      page.goForward() methods for browser history navigation.
      These methods allow you to navigate the page's history,
      similar to clicking the browser's back/forward buttons.

      (example code see the release)

    - Browser module: Request event handlers #5481, #5486
      The browser module now supports page.on('requestfailed') and
      page.on('requestfinished') event handlers, enabling better
      monitoring and debugging of network activity during browser
      tests.
      The requestfailed event fires when a request fails (network
      errors, aborts, etc.), while requestfinished fires when a
      request completes successfully.

      (example code see the release)

      These event handlers provide deeper insights into network
      behavior during browser testing and help identify issues that
      might not be immediately visible.
    - Crypto module: PBKDF2 support #5380
      The crypto module now supports PBKDF2 for deriving
      cryptographic keys from passwords. PBKDF2 is widely used for
      password hashing and key derivation in security-sensitive
      applications, and this addition enables testing of systems
      that use PBKDF2 for authentication or encryption.
      For usage examples, check out the one provided in the
      repository or refer to the documentation.
    - WebSockets module is now stable #5586
      The websockets module has been promoted to stable status and
      is now available via the k6/websockets path.
      The experimental k6/experimental/websockets module will be
      removed in a future release. Users should migrate to the
      stable k6/websockets module.
      To migrate, simply update your import statement:

        // Old (experimental)
        import ws from 'k6/experimental/websockets';

        // New (stable)
        import ws from 'k6/websockets';

      No other changes are required because the API is the same.
    - Console logging: ArrayBuffer and TypedArray support #5496
      console.log() now properly displays ArrayBuffer and
      TypedArray objects, making it easier to debug binary data
      handling in your test scripts. Previously, these types would
      not display useful information, making debugging difficult
      when working with binary protocols, file uploads, or
      WebSocket binary messages.

      (example code see the release)

    - Configurable TLS version for Experimental Prometheus output #5537
      The experimental Prometheus remote write output now supports
      configuring the minimum TLS version used for connections.
      This allows you to meet specific security requirements or
      compatibility constraints when sending metrics to Prometheus
      endpoints.
      If not set, the default minimum TLS version is 1.3.

        K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_TLS_MIN_VERSION=1.3 k6 run script.js -o experimental-prometheus-rw

    - A new TOTP library k6-totp
      A new TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) library is now
      available in jslib.k6.io, enabling k6 scripts to generate and
      validate time-based one-time passwords. This is particularly
      useful for testing applications that use TOTP-based
      two-factor authentication (2FA), such as authenticator apps
      like Google Authenticator or Authy. See the documentation at
      k6-totp.

      (example code see the release)

      The library follows the standard TOTP RFC 6238 specification,
      ensuring compatibility with standard authenticator
      applications.
    - Introducing mcp-k6: AI-assisted k6 script writing mcp-k6
      mcp-k6 is an experimental Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
      for k6. Once connected to your AI assistant or MCP-compatible
      editor (such as Cursor, VS Code, or Claude Desktop), it helps
      you write better k6 scripts faster and run them with
      confidence.
      With mcp-k6, your AI assistant can:
      - Write accurate scripts: Create up-to-date scripts by
        referring to embedded k6 documentation and TypeScript
        definitions to reduce API hallucinations.
      - Validate scripts: Catch syntax errors, missing imports, and
        export default function declarations before execution.
      - Run tests locally: Execute scripts and review results
        without leaving your editor.
      - Generate scripts: Create tests from requirements using
        guided prompts that follow k6 best practices.
      - Convert browser tests: Transform Playwright tests into k6
        browser scripts while preserving test logic.
      To get started, install mcp-k6 via Docker, Homebrew, or from
      source, then configure it with your editor. See the
      documentation for installation instructions and setup guides.

Sun Jan 11 08:24:09 UTC 2026 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * k6 1.5.0 is here 🎉! This release includes:
    - Changes in the browser module:
      - page.waitForEvent() for event-based synchronization with page events.
      - locator.pressSequentially() for character-by-character typing simulation.
    - Improved debugging with deep object logging in console.log().
    - Extended WebSocket support with close code and reason information.
    - Enhanced extension ecosystem with custom subcommands and DNS resolver access.
    - URL-based secret management for external secret services.
    - New machine-readable summary format for test results.
  * Breaking changes
    As per our stability guarantees, breaking changes across minor
    releases are allowed only for experimental features.
    -  #5237 Deprecates the experimental/redis module. The module
       will be removed in a future release. Users should migrate to
       alternative solutions, such as the official k6 Redis
       extension.
  * New features
    - page.waitForEvent() #5478
      The browser module now supports page.waitForEvent(), which
      blocks the caller until a specified event is captured.
      If a predicate is provided, it waits for an event that
      satisfies the predicate. This method is particularly valuable
      for testing scenarios where you need to synchronize your test
      flow with specific browser or page events before proceeding
      with the next action.

        import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

        export const options = {
          scenarios: {
            ui: {
              executor: 'shared-iterations',
              options: {
                browser: {
                  type: 'chromium',
                },
              },
            },
          },
        };

        export default async function () {
          const page = await browser.newPage();

          // Wait for a console message containing specific text
          const msgPromise = page.waitForEvent('console', msg => msg.text().includes('hello'));
          await page.evaluate(() => console.log('hello world'));
          const msg = await msgPromise;
          console.log(msg.text());
          // Output: hello world

          // Wait for a response from a specific URL with timeout
          const resPromise = page.waitForEvent('response', {
            predicate: res => res.url().includes('/api/data'),
            timeout: 5000,
          });
          await page.click('button#fetch-data');
          const res = await resPromise;

          await page.close();
        }

      Event-driven synchronization is vital for test reliability,
      especially when dealing with asynchronous operations where
      timing is unpredictable. This is more robust than using fixed
      delays and helps avoid flaky tests.
    - locator.pressSequentially() #5457
      The browser module now supports locator.pressSequentially(),
      which types text character by character, firing keyboard
      events (keydown, keypress, keyup) for each character. This
      method is essential for testing features that depend on
      gradual typing to trigger specific behaviors, such as
      autocomplete suggestions, real-time input validation per
      character, or dynamic character counters.
      The method supports a configurable delay between keystrokes,
      enabling you to simulate realistic typing speeds and test
      time-dependent input handlers:

        import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

        export const options = {
          scenarios: {
            ui: {
              executor: 'shared-iterations',
              options: {
                browser: {
                  type: 'chromium',
                },
              },
            },
          },
        };

        export default async function () {
          const page = await browser.newPage();

          try {
            await page.goto('https://test.k6.io/browser.php');

            // Type text character by character
            const searchInput = page.locator('#text1');
            await searchInput.pressSequentially('Hello World');

            // Type with delay to simulate realistic typing speed
            await searchInput.clear();
            await searchInput.pressSequentially('test query', { delay: 100 });
          } finally {
            await page.close();
          }
        }

      This complements existing text input methods: locator.fill()
      for simple form filling, locator.type() for gradual typing
      without keyboard events, and now pressSequentially for
      character-by-character typing with full keyboard event
      firing.
    - console.log() Deep Object Logging #5460
      console.log() now properly traverses and displays complex
      JavaScript structures, including functions, classes, and
      circular references. Previously, Sobek's JSON marshaling
      would lose nested functions, classes, and other
      non-serializable types, making debugging painful.
      Objects with mixed function and class properties are now
      properly displayed:

        console.log({
          one: class {},
          two: function() {}
        });
        // Before: {}
        // After:  {"one":"[object Function]","two":"[object Function]"}

      Nested arrays and objects with functions are now fully
      traversed:

        console.log([
          { handler: class {} },
          { data: [1, 2, class {}] }
        ]);
        // Before: [{},{"data":[1,2,null]}]
        // After:  [{"handler":"[object Function]"},{"data":[1,2,"[object Function]"]}]

      Complex objects with multiple property types are properly
      preserved:

        console.log({
          a: [1, 2, 3],
          b: class {},
          c: () => {},
          d: function() {},
          e: [1, () => {}, function() {}, class {}, 2]
        });
        // Before: {"a":[1,2,3],"e":[1,null,null,null,2]}
        // After:  {
        //   "a":[1,2,3],
        //   "b":"[object Function]",
        //   "c":"[object Function]",
        //   "d":"[object Function]",
        //   "e":[1,"[object Function]","[object Function]","[object Function]",2]
        // }

      Circular references are now properly detected and marked:

        const obj = {
          fn: function() {},
          foo: {}
        };
        obj.foo = obj;

        console.log(obj);
        // Before: [object Object]
        // After:  {"fn":"[object Function]","foo":"[Circular]"}

      This improvement makes debugging k6 test scripts
      significantly easier when working with API responses, event
      handlers, and complex state objects.
    - experimental/websockets - Close Code and Reason Support #5376
      The experimental WebSockets module now supports sending close
      codes and reasons when closing connections, and properly
      captures close event information. This is essential for
      testing WebSocket implementations that rely on specific close
      codes to determine whether a connection was closed normally
      or due to an error.

        import ws from 'k6/experimental/websockets';

        export default function () {
          const socket = ws.connect('ws://example.com', (socket) => {
            socket.on('close', (data) => {
              console.log(`Connection closed with code: ${data.code}, reason: ${data.reason}`);
              // Output: Connection closed with code: 1000, reason: Normal closure
            });
          });

          // Close with code and reason
          socket.close(1000, 'Normal closure');
        }

    - Subcommand Extension Support #5399
      Extensions can now register custom subcommands under the k6 x
      namespace, enabling custom command-line tools that integrate
      seamlessly with k6. This provides a consistent and
      discoverable way for extensions to offer specialized CLI
      utilities while maintaining k6's familiar command structure.
      Extensions can now define custom commands like:
        k6 x my-tool --help
        k6 x debug --inspect
      This integration pattern allows extension authors to provide
      powerful tooling that feels native to the k6 ecosystem.
    - DNS Resolver Access #5421
      Extensions can now access k6's DNS resolver for custom DNS
      handling and networking extensions. The resolver respects
      k6's configuration including hosts overrides, custom DNS
      servers, and DNS caching settings. This enables extensions to
      use it directly instead of having to reproduce the
      functionality. Which also makes them work the same way as
      native modules.
    - Machine-Readable Summary Format #5338
      A new machine-readable summary format for the end-of-test
      summary is now available, providing structured, programmatic
      shapes via --summary-export and handleSummary(). This format
      is designed for easier integration with external systems and
      analytics pipelines.
      The new format is currently opt-in via the
      --new-machine-readable-summary flag or
      K6_NEW_MACHINE_READABLE_SUMMARY environment variable, and
      will become the default in k6 v2:

        k6 run script.js --new-machine-readable-summary --summary-export=summary.json

      This makes it easier to integrate k6 results into CI/CD
      pipelines, dashboards, and custom analysis tools.
    - URL-Based Secret Management #5413
      The secret management system now supports URL-based secret
      sources, allowing k6 to fetch secrets from HTTP endpoints.
      This lets users implement a simple HTTP API to provide
      secrets to a test. There is a mock implementation, but no
      particular production-ready implementation is provided at
      this time. In the future, there is potential for proxies to
      other systems, including HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets
      Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #5458 Adds link to k6 extensions list in README for better
      discoverability.
    - #5366 Adds multi-source secret example for better
      documentation of secret management patterns.
  * Bug fixes
    - #5374 Fixes getBy* selectors when using quotes inside element
      names.
    - #5477 Fixes retry mechanism when frame has been detached.
    - #5461 Fixes panic when using nil page.on handlers.

  * Roadmap
    - Deprecation of First Input Delay (FID) Web Vital
      Following the official web vitals guidance, First Input Delay
      (FID) is no longer a Core Web Vital as of September 9, 2024,
      having been replaced by Interaction to Next Paint (INP). The
      k6 browser module already emits INP metrics, and we're
      planning to deprecate FID support to align with industry
      standards.
      FID only measures the delay before the browser runs your
      event handler, so it ignores the time your code takes and the
      delay to paint the UI—often underestimating how slow an
      interaction feels. INP captures the full interaction latency
      (input delay + processing + next paint) across a page’s
      interactions, so it better reflects real user-perceived
      responsiveness and is replacing FID.

      Action required
      If you're currently using FID in your test scripts for
      thresholds or relying on it in external integrations, you
      should migrate to using INP as soon as possible.

        // Instead of relying on FID
        export const options = {
          thresholds: {
            // 'browser_web_vital_fid': ['p(95)<100'], // Deprecated
            'browser_web_vital_inp': ['p(95)<200'], // Use INP instead
          },
        };

      This change ensures k6 browser testing stays aligned with
      modern web performance best practices and Core Web Vitals
      standards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 10 13:09:41 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  k6 v1.4.0 is here! This release includes:
  * OpenTelemetry output graduated from experimental to stable
    status.
  * Changes in the Browser module:
    - page.waitForRequest for waiting on specific HTTP requests.
    - QueryAll methods now return elements in DOM order.
    - locator.evaluate and locator.evaluateHandle for executing
      JavaScript code in the page context with access to the
      matching element.
    - page.unroute(url) and page.unrouteAll for removing routes
      registered with page.route.
  * Breaking changes
    As per our stability guarantees, breaking changes across minor
    releases are allowed only for experimental features.
    - Breaking changes for experimental modules
      - #5164 OpenTelemetry output now exports rate metrics as a
        single counter with zero/nonzero labels instead of separate
        metrics.
      - #5333 OpenTelemetry output configuration:
        K6_OTEL_EXPORTER_TYPE is deprecated in favor of
        K6_OTEL_EXPORTER_PROTOCOL to align with OpenTelemetry
        standards.
    - Breaking changes for undefined behaviours
      - #5320, #5239, #5342 Automatic extension resolution now only
        inspects ES module import statements and no longer supports
        CommonJS require() calls. CommonJS require() calls are
        dynamic, and it is not possible to know for certain if they
        will be called, or if they will be called with static
        strings - the only way they were even previously loaded.
        This functionality was a quirk of the previous
        implementation and had numerous problems. Additionally, use
        k6 directives are now only recognized when they appear at
        the beginning of files (after optional shebang and
        whitespace/comments). This was the original intention, but
        due to implementation bugs, it did not accurately reflect
        what was happening.
  * New features
    - OpenTelemetry output graduation #5334
      The OpenTelemetry output has graduated from experimental
      status and is now available as a stable output using the name
      opentelemetry. This change makes OpenTelemetry the
      recommended vendor-agnostic solution for exporting k6
      telemetry data.
      You can now use the stable output name in your k6 commands:

        # Previous experimental usage (still supported for backward compatibility)
      K6 run --out experimental-opentelemetry script.js

      # New stable usage
      K6 run --out opentelemetry script.js

      The experimental-opentelemetry name will continue to work for
      backward compatibility for now but it's deprecated and we
      might remove it in future versions. We recommend migrating to
      use the new opentelemetry name.
    - page.waitForRequest #5330
      The browser module now supports page.waitForRequest(), which
      allows you to wait for HTTP requests that match specific URL
      patterns during browser automation. This method is
      particularly valuable for testing scenarios where you need to
      ensure specific network requests are initiated before
      proceeding with test actions.

      The method supports multiple URL pattern matching strategies:

        // Wait for exact URL match
        const requestPromise = page.waitForRequest('https://api.example.com/data');
        await page.click('button[data-testid="load-data"]');
        const request = await requestPromise;

        // Wait for regex pattern match
        await page.waitForRequest(/\/api\/.*\.json$/);

        // Use with Promise.all for coordinated actions
        await Promise.all([
          page.waitForRequest('https://api.example.com/user-data'),
          page.click('button[data-testid="load-user-data"]')
        ]);

      This complements the existing page.waitForResponse() method
      by focusing on HTTP requests rather than responses, providing
      more granular control over network-dependent test scenarios.
    - page.unroute(url) and page.unrouteAll() #5223
      The browser module now supports page.unroute(url) and
      page.unrouteAll(), allowing you to remove routes previously
      registered with page.route.

      Example usage:

        await page.route(/.*\/api\/pizza/, function (route) {
          console.log('Modifying request to /api/pizza');
          route.continue({
            postData: JSON.stringify({
              customName: 'My Pizza',
            }),
          });
        });
        ...

        await page.unroute(/.*\/api\/pizza/); // The URL needs to be exactly the same as the one used in the call to the `route` function

        await page.route(/.*\/api\/pizza/, function (route) {
          console.log('Modifying request to /api/pizza');
          route.continue({
            postData: JSON.stringify({
              customName: 'My Pizza',
            }),
          });
        });
        ...

        await page.unrouteAll();

    - locator.evaluate and locator.evaluateHandle #5306
      The browser module now supports locator.evaluate and
      locator.evaluateHandle, allowing you to execute JavaScript
      code in the page context with access to the matching element.
      The only difference between evaluate and evaluateHandle is
      that evaluateHandle returns a JSHandle.
      Example usage:

        await check(page, {
          'calling evaluate': async p => {
            const n = await p.locator('#pizza-name').evaluate(pizzaName => pizzaName.textContent);
            return n == 'Our recommendation:';
          }
        });

        await check(page, {
          'calling evaluate with arguments': async p => {
            const n = await p.locator('#pizza-name').evaluate((pizzaName, extra) => pizzaName.textContent + extra, ' Super pizza!');
            return n == 'Our recommendation: Super pizza!';
          }
        });

        const jsHandle = await page.locator('#pizza-name').evaluateHandle((pizzaName) => pizzaName);

        const obj = await jsHandle.evaluateHandle((handle) => {
          return { innerText: handle.innerText };
        });
        console.log(await obj.jsonValue()); // {"innerText":"Our recommendation:"}

    - New officially supported k6 DNS extension
      The xk6-dns extension is now officially supported in k6 OSS
      and k6 Cloud. You can import k6/x/dns directly in your
      scripts thanks to automatic extension resolution, with no
      custom build required.
      Use it to perform DNS resolution testing as part of your
      tests: resolve names via custom or system DNS, measure
      resolution latency and errors, validate records before HTTP
      steps, compare resolvers, and even load test DNS servers in
      end‑to‑end scenarios.
      For example:

        import dns from 'k6/x/dns';

        export default function () {
          const answer = dns.resolve('grafana.com', { recordType: 'A' });
          console.log(answer.records.map(({ address }) => address).join(', '));
        }

      The extension currently supports A and AAAA record lookups.
      If you would like to see additional record types supported,
      please consider contributing to the extension.
    - Automatic extension resolution improvements #5320, #5239,
      #5342, #5332, #5240
      Automatic extension resolution has been completely
      reimplemented to use k6's internal module loader instead of
      the external k6deps/esbuild pipeline. This change brings
      significant improvements in reliability and maintainability.
      As part of the rewrite, a few issues and unintended features
      were found, namely:
      - Trying to follow require calls, which, due to their dynamic
        nature, don't work particularly stably. That is, depending
        on where and how the require call was used, k6 might decide
        whether it is needed or not. And it definitely doesn't work
        when using actual string variables. Support for CommonJS is
        primarily for backward compatibility, so after an internal
        discussion, we opted not to support it at all. We could
        bring this back until v2, if there is enough interest.
        However, in the long term, it is intended that this not be
        part of k6.
      - "use k6 with ..." directives were parsed from the whole
        file instead of just the beginning, which leads to numerous
        problems, and was not the intended case. As such, they are
        now only parsed at the beginning of files (not just the
        main one) with potential empty lines and comments preceding
        them.
      Example:

        // main.js
        "use k6 with k6/x/faker"
        import { faker } from 'k6/x/faker';
        import { helper } from './utils.js';

        export default function() {
          console.log(faker.name());
          helper();
        }

     Or, an example using the directive with CommonJS

        // utils.js
        "use k6 with k6/x/redis"
        const redis = require('k6/x/redis');

        exports.helper = function() {
          // Use redis extension
        }

      In this example, k6 will detect both k6/x/faker and
      k6/x/redis extensions from the use k6 directives in both
      files and provision a binary that includes both extensions if
      needed.
      Other fixes this brings are:
      - Fixes for path related issues (irregardless of usage of the
        feature) on windows, especially between drives. It is
        possible there were problems on other OSes that were just
        not reported. #5176
      - Syntax errors were not reported as such, as the underlying
        esbuild parsing will fail, but won't be handled well.
        #5127, #5104
      - Propagating exit codes from a sub-process running the new
        k6. This lets you use the result of the exit code.

Tue Sep 23 10:39:56 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.3.0:
  New features and their explanations can be found in the release
  notes. You can also find the roadmap there.
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.3.0
  * Deprecations
    - A new summary mode disabled has been introduced to replace
      the "no summary" option #5118
      The --no-summary flag and its corresponding environment
      variable K6_NO_SUMMARY have been deprecated in favor of the
      new disabled summary mode. This change unifies the
      configuration experience for controlling the end-of-test
      summary. You can now disable the end-of-test summary with
      either --summary-mode=disabled or K6_SUMMARY_MODE=disabled.
    - The legacy summary mode has been deprecated #5138
      The legacy summary mode was introduced in k6 v1.0, when the
      end-of-test summary was revamped with the addition of two new
      modes: compact and full.  Its purpose was to ease the
      transition for users who relied heavily on the old summary
      format. However, we’ve now reached the point where it’s time
      to deprecate it. The plan is to fully remove it in k6 v2.0,
      so please migrate to either compact or full to ensure
      readiness for the next major release.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #5117 Unifies unauthenticated errors for Cloud commands.

    - #5178 Fixes a subtle metric labelling issue in Prometheus RW
      output.
    - #5200 Fixes a bug where clearTimeout would not recalculate
      the timer but instead will run the next timer earlier if it
      used to remove the earliest one.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements

      and fixes due to the update.
    - #5051, #5052, #5053 Adds tests and refactors getBy* and
      waitForURL implementations.
    - #5101 Updates times to nanoseconds to make tests less flakey
      in CI.
    - #5122 Migrates to use a new code signing process for Windows
      binaries instead of using the static code-signing
      certificate. Thanks @martincostello for the contribution!
    - #5048 Updates release issue template after v1.2.0

  It was left over on the machine since the merging of the two
  repos. As such it can not be used as a go module or installed
  with go install. For this reason v1.2.1 is released.

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  The release notes contain a lot of examples and documentation on
  new features, please check it out here:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.2.0
  * Breaking changes
    As per our stability guarantees, breaking changes across minor
    releases are allowed only for experimental features.
    Breaking changes for experimental modules
    - The experimental Open Telemetry and Prometheus outputs now
      default to TLSv1.3. This should've been the default to
      begin with. It is not expected that anyone should be
      affected, apart from making it more secure for the metrics
      output to send messages.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4878 Do not report NaN percentages when there are no checks
      in the end of test summary. Thank you @Fernando-hub527 for
      the fix.
    - #4897 Support string-labels in locator.selectOption in the
      browser module.
    - #4898 Add support for authority pseudo header to the gRPC
      module. Thank you @Oursin for the changes.
    - #4916 Print errors more consistently and correctly.
    - #4918 Surface navigation errors from navigation events in the
      browser module.
    - #4919 page.url() now doesn't make a call to the browser but
      instead uses a cached version. Making it a lot faster and
      aligned with playwright.
    - #4932 Making it more clear that the requests were aborted in
      the browser module.
    - #4944 Add Prometheus metrics endpoint. Thank you @gouthamve.
    - #5040 Use new expect() syntax in script templates.
    - #4976 Align metrics in end of test summary with using less
      dots and less horizontal space.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4850 Fixes incorrect conversions between integer types in
      the browser module.
    - #4973 Fixes panic when BrowserContext is requested before
      creating a Page in the browser module.
    - #4975 Fixes potential race conditions in the browser module.
    - #5015 Fixes waitForNavigation now blocking the iteration from
      ending if page.close is not called.
    - #5017 Fixes potential race conditions in gRPC module, when it
      gets protobuf defintions from remote server.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4666 Lowers the log level on some cloud output logs that
      were too noisy.
    - #4879, #4945 Updates of software used by the internal

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.1.0
  * k6 v1.1.0 is here 🎉! This release includes:
    - New count, nth, first, and last methods for the browser
      module's Locator API #4797, #4825
    - The k6/experimental/webcrypto module has been removed as its
      functionality is available globally.
    - Group results in the full end-of-test summary are now sorted as
      in code and properly indented.
  * Breaking changes for experimental modules
    - Remove experimental k6/experimental/webcrypto module #4851
      The WebCrypto API has been available globally since
      v1.0.0-rc1 (or v0.58.0), and now the experimental import
      (k6/experimental/webcrypto) is no longer available.
      The required change for users is to remove the import; the
      rest of the code should work.
  * New features
    - New count method for the browser module's Locator API #4797
      The new locator.Count method returns the number of elements
      matching the locator. Unlike other Locator API methods,
      locator.Count returns the result immediately and doesn't wait
      for the elements to be visible.
    - New nth, first and last methods for the browser module's
      Locator API #4825
      The new Locator API methods, nth, first, and last, can select
      a single element from multiple elements matched by a locator.
      For example, selecting a single item from a catalogue of
      items on an e-commerce website. Because items in this
      catalogue generally change often and selecting an exact
      element may fail in future test runs, the new methods help to
      prevent flaky tests, leading to more reliable tests.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4807 Sorts full end-of-test summary group results as in code
      and fixes the indentation. Thanks, @the-it, for the
      contribution!
    - #4832 Uses consistent error messages in the execution config
      options.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4794 Fixes race conditions from stringifying types in
      k6/browser.
    - #4809 Fixes the locator.fill method when used on react based
      websites.
    - #4831 Fixes the Dockerfile for k8s use by setting the user to
      12345 instead of k6 to avoid having to work with runAsUser in
      the pod manifest file.
    - #4845 Fixes an infrequent panic when click is called.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4608 Enables the 'copyloopvar' linter.
    - #4744 Updates the 'golangci-lint' linter to v2.
    - #4746 Adds a collection of small k6/browser performance
      improvements.
    - #4750 Fixes the lint GHA.
    - #4775 Updates the version of the golangci-lint GHA.
    - #4784 Fixes the golangci-lint version detection and
      execution. Thanks, @tbourrely, for the contribution!
    - #4785 Updates the chromedp/cdproto dependency and adjusts the
      Browser module accordingly.
    - #4800 Allows un/marshaling of invalid UTF-8 when using JSONv2
      within the Browser module.
    - #4802 Fixes the examples/grpc_server and updates its
      dependencies.
    - #4822 Uses the CODECOV_TOKEN variable for GH Workflows from
      Vault.
    - #4831 Fixes the default user defined in the Dockerfile.
    - #4833 Retrieves secrets from Vault and adjusts the
      'k6packager' deployment process.
    - #4837, #4847 Prevent Codecov from running on forks.
    - #4848 Enables CI pipelines to be executed also on ARM
      (ubuntu-24.04-arm). Thanks, @nadiamoe, for the contribution!
    - #4855 Adds some changes to make Browser tests more stable.
    - #4864 Updates the logging to debug and adds more context to
      it when waiting for an element to be detached.
    - #4780, #4781, #4782, #4786, #4798, #4816, #4821, #4835, #4840
      Update direct dependencies.

Tue May 06 11:22:39 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.0.0:
  Grafana k6 v1.0 is here!
  After 9 years of iteration and countless community contributions,
  we're thrilled to announce Grafana k6 v1.0.

  introduced gradually in previous versions, k6 v1.0 marks a
  turning point: a commitment to stability, formal support
  guarantees, and transparency in how we evolve and develop the
  project from here. This milestone is more than a version number;
  it's about trust, reliability, and empowering you to test
  confidently.

  What's New in k6 1.0?
  * Stability You Can Build On
  * First-Class TypeScript Support
  * Extensions Made Simple
  * Revamped test summary
  * Quality of Life Upgrades

  Full changelog:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.0.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 06 04:56:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.59.0:
  The v0.59.0 release mirrors the previous v1.0.0-rc2 release to
  allow automation tools to recognize it as the latest version.
  For example, Homebrew's k6 formulae and pkg.go.dev do not
  automatically fetch unstable versions such as v1.0.0-rc2, which
  is legitimately the expected behavior for these tools.
  However, this has been the default for all previous v0.*
  releases, where they were considered the latest stable
  version—even if they were under a version typically associated
  with unstable releases. To address this, we will continue
  releasing mirrored versions under v0.* for necessary release
  candidates.
  This practice will end once the official stable v1.0.0 release is
  available, after which we will follow the standard SemVer
  lifecycle to simplify the workflow for everyone.
  The release notes for v1.0.0-rc2 provide a detailed look at all
  the changes that have been implemented since v1.0.0-rc1/v0.58.0
  and are now part of this version.
  * New features
    - Native support for extensions in the Cloud #4671
      The new Binary Provisioning feature automatically requests
      and uses custom k6 binaries with the required extensions for
      your tests. This allows you to run scripts that use
      extensions without manually rebuilding k6 as it was in the
      past by depending on tools like xk6. The system caches
      binaries locally for efficiency, and any additional runs with
      the same dependencies will use the same binary and will run
      faster.
      Binary Provisioning is available for all k6 Cloud users (free
      and paid plans). It is an experimental feature, it's enabled
      by opt-in with the feature flag K6_BINARY_PROVISIONING=true.
      Binary provisioning is a limited set of extensions that are
      supported, and it's not available for the k6 run command that
      might be added in the future. However, local development is
      supported with the k6 cloud --local-execution command if a
      cloud token is provided by the canonical login methods.
      Check out the documentation for additional details.
      https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/author-run/use-k6-extensions
    - Test failure control with execution.test.fail #4672
      The new execution.test.fail function allows you to explicitly
      fail a test while letting it continue execution until
      completion. This gives you more control over test outcomes
      while still collecting all metrics and completing necessary
      cleanup tasks.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4698 Displays threshold values even when are not configured
      in summaryTrendStats option.
    - #4699 Drops the link of the legacy k6 website from the user
      agent.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4717 Safeguards against pressedKeys being updated
      concurrently in the browser module.
    - #4665 Prevents race condition between Ended & Interrupted
      execution states.
    - #4677 Makes secretsource also redact float32 and float64
      values.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4675, #4676, #4678 Move several packages to internal as
      preparations for v1.0.0 stabilization
    - #4686 Drops the redundant NO_COLOR detection.
    - #4709 Fixes JS native objects override to avoid a page under
      the test from overwriting native JavaScript objects, like Set
      and Map.
    - #4726 Unifies the internal/cmd.Execute methods.
    - #4703 Makes wptTests run without tags or skip if repos not
      checkout.
    - #4701 Fixes WebCrypto errors not propagating from the tests.
    - #4691, #4674, #4673, #4663 Bumps the versions for
      OpenTelemetry, grpc, golang/x and esbuild dependencies.
    - #4691 Bumps x509roots/fallback dependency for fallback
      certificates.
    - #4739 Removes deprecated GetLayoutMetrics.VisualViewport CDP
      usage.
