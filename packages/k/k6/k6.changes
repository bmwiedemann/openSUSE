- Update to version 1.2.1:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.2.1
  Note: An old xk6-browser repo v1.2.0 tag was pushed by mistake.
  It was left over on the machine since the merging of the two
  repos. As such it can not be used as a go module or installed
  with go install. For this reason v1.2.1 is released.

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  The release notes contain a lot of examples and documentation on
  new features, please check it out here:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.2.0
  * Breaking changes
    As per our stability guarantees, breaking changes across minor
    releases are allowed only for experimental features.
    Breaking changes for experimental modules
    - The experimental Open Telemetry and Prometheus outputs now
      default to TLSv1.3. This should've been the default to
      begin with. It is not expected that anyone should be
      affected, apart from making it more secure for the metrics
      output to send messages.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4878 Do not report NaN percentages when there are no checks
      in the end of test summary. Thank you @Fernando-hub527 for
      the fix.
    - #4897 Support string-labels in locator.selectOption in the
      browser module.
    - #4898 Add support for authority pseudo header to the gRPC
      module. Thank you @Oursin for the changes.
    - #4916 Print errors more consistently and correctly.
    - #4918 Surface navigation errors from navigation events in the
      browser module.
    - #4919 page.url() now doesn't make a call to the browser but
      instead uses a cached version. Making it a lot faster and
      aligned with playwright.
    - #4932 Making it more clear that the requests were aborted in
      the browser module.
    - #4944 Add Prometheus metrics endpoint. Thank you @gouthamve.
    - #5040 Use new expect() syntax in script templates.
    - #4976 Align metrics in end of test summary with using less
      dots and less horizontal space.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4850 Fixes incorrect conversions between integer types in
      the browser module.
    - #4973 Fixes panic when BrowserContext is requested before
      creating a Page in the browser module.
    - #4975 Fixes potential race conditions in the browser module.
    - #5015 Fixes waitForNavigation now blocking the iteration from
      ending if page.close is not called.
    - #5017 Fixes potential race conditions in gRPC module, when it
      gets protobuf defintions from remote server.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4666 Lowers the log level on some cloud output logs that
      were too noisy.
    - #4879, #4945 Updates of software used by the internal

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v1.1.0
  * k6 v1.1.0 is here 🎉! This release includes:
    - New count, nth, first, and last methods for the browser
      module's Locator API #4797, #4825
    - The k6/experimental/webcrypto module has been removed as its
      functionality is available globally.
    - Group results in the full end-of-test summary are now sorted as
      in code and properly indented.
  * Breaking changes for experimental modules
    - Remove experimental k6/experimental/webcrypto module #4851
      The WebCrypto API has been available globally since
      v1.0.0-rc1 (or v0.58.0), and now the experimental import
      (k6/experimental/webcrypto) is no longer available.
      The required change for users is to remove the import; the
      rest of the code should work.
  * New features
    - New count method for the browser module's Locator API #4797
      The new locator.Count method returns the number of elements
      matching the locator. Unlike other Locator API methods,
      locator.Count returns the result immediately and doesn't wait
      for the elements to be visible.
    - New nth, first and last methods for the browser module's
      Locator API #4825
      The new Locator API methods, nth, first, and last, can select
      a single element from multiple elements matched by a locator.
      For example, selecting a single item from a catalogue of
      items on an e-commerce website. Because items in this
      catalogue generally change often and selecting an exact
      element may fail in future test runs, the new methods help to
      prevent flaky tests, leading to more reliable tests.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4807 Sorts full end-of-test summary group results as in code
      and fixes the indentation. Thanks, @the-it, for the
      contribution!
    - #4832 Uses consistent error messages in the execution config
      options.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4794 Fixes race conditions from stringifying types in
      k6/browser.
    - #4809 Fixes the locator.fill method when used on react based
      websites.
    - #4831 Fixes the Dockerfile for k8s use by setting the user to
      12345 instead of k6 to avoid having to work with runAsUser in
      the pod manifest file.
    - #4845 Fixes an infrequent panic when click is called.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4608 Enables the 'copyloopvar' linter.
    - #4744 Updates the 'golangci-lint' linter to v2.
    - #4746 Adds a collection of small k6/browser performance
      improvements.
    - #4750 Fixes the lint GHA.
    - #4775 Updates the version of the golangci-lint GHA.
    - #4784 Fixes the golangci-lint version detection and
      execution. Thanks, @tbourrely, for the contribution!
    - #4785 Updates the chromedp/cdproto dependency and adjusts the
      Browser module accordingly.
    - #4800 Allows un/marshaling of invalid UTF-8 when using JSONv2
      within the Browser module.
    - #4802 Fixes the examples/grpc_server and updates its
      dependencies.
    - #4822 Uses the CODECOV_TOKEN variable for GH Workflows from
      Vault.
    - #4831 Fixes the default user defined in the Dockerfile.
    - #4833 Retrieves secrets from Vault and adjusts the
      'k6packager' deployment process.
    - #4837, #4847 Prevent Codecov from running on forks.
    - #4848 Enables CI pipelines to be executed also on ARM
      (ubuntu-24.04-arm). Thanks, @nadiamoe, for the contribution!
    - #4855 Adds some changes to make Browser tests more stable.
    - #4864 Updates the logging to debug and adds more context to
      it when waiting for an element to be detached.
    - #4780, #4781, #4782, #4786, #4798, #4816, #4821, #4835, #4840
      Update direct dependencies.

  introduced gradually in previous versions, k6 v1.0 marks a
  turning point: a commitment to stability, formal support
  guarantees, and transparency in how we evolve and develop the
  project from here. This milestone is more than a version number;
  it's about trust, reliability, and empowering you to test
  confidently.

  What's New in k6 1.0?
  * Stability You Can Build On
  * First-Class TypeScript Support
  * Extensions Made Simple
  * Revamped test summary
  * Quality of Life Upgrades

  Full changelog:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 06 04:56:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.59.0:
  The v0.59.0 release mirrors the previous v1.0.0-rc2 release to
  allow automation tools to recognize it as the latest version.
  For example, Homebrew's k6 formulae and pkg.go.dev do not
  automatically fetch unstable versions such as v1.0.0-rc2, which
  is legitimately the expected behavior for these tools.
  However, this has been the default for all previous v0.*
  releases, where they were considered the latest stable
  version—even if they were under a version typically associated
  with unstable releases. To address this, we will continue
  releasing mirrored versions under v0.* for necessary release
  candidates.
  This practice will end once the official stable v1.0.0 release is
  available, after which we will follow the standard SemVer
  lifecycle to simplify the workflow for everyone.
  The release notes for v1.0.0-rc2 provide a detailed look at all
  the changes that have been implemented since v1.0.0-rc1/v0.58.0
  and are now part of this version.
  * New features
    - Native support for extensions in the Cloud #4671
      The new Binary Provisioning feature automatically requests
      and uses custom k6 binaries with the required extensions for
      your tests. This allows you to run scripts that use
      extensions without manually rebuilding k6 as it was in the
      past by depending on tools like xk6. The system caches
      binaries locally for efficiency, and any additional runs with
      the same dependencies will use the same binary and will run
      faster.
      Binary Provisioning is available for all k6 Cloud users (free
      and paid plans). It is an experimental feature, it's enabled
      by opt-in with the feature flag K6_BINARY_PROVISIONING=true.
      Binary provisioning is a limited set of extensions that are
      supported, and it's not available for the k6 run command that
      might be added in the future. However, local development is
      supported with the k6 cloud --local-execution command if a
      cloud token is provided by the canonical login methods.
      Check out the documentation for additional details.
      https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/author-run/use-k6-extensions
    - Test failure control with execution.test.fail #4672
      The new execution.test.fail function allows you to explicitly
      fail a test while letting it continue execution until
      completion. This gives you more control over test outcomes
      while still collecting all metrics and completing necessary
      cleanup tasks.
  * UX improvements and enhancements
    - #4698 Displays threshold values even when are not configured
      in summaryTrendStats option.
    - #4699 Drops the link of the legacy k6 website from the user
      agent.
  * Bug fixes
    - #4717 Safeguards against pressedKeys being updated
      concurrently in the browser module.
    - #4665 Prevents race condition between Ended & Interrupted
      execution states.
    - #4677 Makes secretsource also redact float32 and float64
      values.
  * Maintenance and internal improvements
    - #4675, #4676, #4678 Move several packages to internal as
      preparations for v1.0.0 stabilization
    - #4686 Drops the redundant NO_COLOR detection.
    - #4709 Fixes JS native objects override to avoid a page under
      the test from overwriting native JavaScript objects, like Set
      and Map.
    - #4726 Unifies the internal/cmd.Execute methods.
    - #4703 Makes wptTests run without tags or skip if repos not
      checkout.
    - #4701 Fixes WebCrypto errors not propagating from the tests.
    - #4691, #4674, #4673, #4663 Bumps the versions for
      OpenTelemetry, grpc, golang/x and esbuild dependencies.
    - #4691 Bumps x509roots/fallback dependency for fallback
      certificates.
    - #4739 Removes deprecated GetLayoutMetrics.VisualViewport CDP
      usage.
