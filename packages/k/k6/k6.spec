%description
k6 is a modern load-testing tool, built on our years of experience in the
performance and testing industries. It's built to be powerful, extensible, and
full-featured. The key design goal is to provide the best developer experience.

Its core features are:

- Configurable load generation. Even lower-end machines can simulate lots of
  traffic.
- Tests as code. Reuse scripts, modularize logic, version control, and
  integrate tests with your CI.
- A full-featured API. The scripting API is packed with features that help you
  simulate real application traffic.
- An embedded JavaScript engine. The performance of Go, the scripting
  familiarity of JavaScript.
- Multiple Protocol support. HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, Browser, and more.
- Large extension ecosystem. You can extend k6 to support your needs. And many
  people have already shared their extensions with the community!
- Flexible metrics storage and visualization. Summary statistics or granular
  metrics, exported to the service of your choice.
- Native integration with Grafana cloud. SaaS solution for test execution,
  metrics correlation, data analysis, and more.

This is what load testing looks like in the 21st century.
