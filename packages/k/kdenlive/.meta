  <title>Non-linear video editor</title>
  <description>Kdenlive is a non-linear video editor for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, which supports
DV, AVCHD (experimental support) and HDV editing. Kdenlive relies on several
other open source projects, such as FFmpeg and the MLT video framework. It was
designed to answer all needs, from basic video editing to semi-professional
work.
