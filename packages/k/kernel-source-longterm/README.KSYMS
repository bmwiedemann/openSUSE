This file is a place holder for the kernel-syms{,-rt} package. It is used
to group build dependencies for all kernel flavors.

The KMP build process will build KMPs against all installed kernel flavors
automatically. If you don't need to build against other flavors than the
ones you've already installed - it is safe to uninstall this package.
