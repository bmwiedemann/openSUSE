  <description>KtikZ is a small application helping you to create TikZ (from the LaTeX pgf package) diagrams for your publications. It requires qt5, libpoppler, LaTeX (pdflatex), the LaTeX preview-latex-style package and pgf itself. For the eps export functionality you also need the poppler-utils package.</description>
