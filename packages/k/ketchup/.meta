  <title>Tool for downloading and updating Linux kernel source trees</title>
  <description>This tool synchronises a local kernel tree with a desired kernel ver-
sion and patch set from a kernel.org mirror. The default requires a GPG
key on your keyring, to verify the identity of the patches and source
archives. Entire kernel images are not downloaded unless necessary, so
bandwidth is saved. Patches are applied and removed as necessary to
attain the requested version.</description>
