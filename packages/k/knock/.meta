  <title>A Port-Knocking Client</title>
  <description>The server part (package knockd) listens to all traffic on an ethernet
(or PPP) interface, looking for special &quot;knock&quot; sequences of port hits.
This client makes these port hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
port on the server. This port does not need to be open. Since knockd
listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if it is
destined for a closed port. When the server detects a specific sequence
of port hits, it runs a command defined in its configuration file. This
can be used to open up holes in a firewall for quick access.</description>
