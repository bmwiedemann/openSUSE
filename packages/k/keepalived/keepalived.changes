- Update to 2.0.17 (2019-06-25)
  * https://www.keepalived.org/changelog.html 
- remove obsolete patch
  * systemd-after-snmp.patch
- rebase patch
  * linux-4.15.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 16 19:04:13 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- added systemd-after-snmp.patch:
  If you want to use the snmp support the masterx socket needs be
  available otherwise the snmp support is broken
  strictly speaking we would need to use BindsTo= here but that
  would require that add a Requires for net-snmp to the keepalived
  package. to be discussed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 16 19:01:38 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.15
  - Fix uninitialised variable.
  - Fix rpmbuild on CentOS7, and rely on auto-requires.
  - Add option to flush lvs on shutdown.  Currently all known
    virtual servers and their real servers are removed one at a
    time at shutdown. With large configurations on a busy system,
    this can take some time.  Add an option just like the existing
    'lvs_flush' which operates on shutdown. Typical environments
    with a single keepalived instance can take advantage of this
    option to achieve a faster shutdown or restart cycle.
  - Make alpha mode checkers on new real servers start down on
    reload.  Patch #1180 identified that new real servers with
    alpha mode checkers were being added online immediately, and if
    the checker then failed were being removed. This commit makes
    real servers that didn't exist before the reload start in down
    state if they have alpha mode checkers.
  - Remove duplicate config dump entry.
  - Make new real servers at reload start down if have alpha mode
    checkers.
  - Close checker and smtp_alert sockets on reload.  Issue #1177
    identified that sockets were being left open (lost) after a
    reload. It transpired that these were sockets opened by
    TCP_CHECK, HTTP_GET, SSL_GET, DNS_CHECK and SMTP_CHECK
    checkers, and by smtp_alerts in the process of being sent.
    This commit adds an extra parameter to thread_add_read() and
    thread_add_write() to allow indicating that the scheduler
    should close the socket when destroying threads.
  - Send vrrp group backup notifies at startup.
  - Make inhibit_on_failure be inherited by real server from
    virtual server.
  - Allow real and sorry servers to be configured with port 0 This
    is to maintain backwards compatibility with keepalived prior to
    commit d87f07c - "Ensure always check return from
    inet_stosockaddr when parsing config".  The proper way to
    configure this is to omit the port, which requires the next
    commit.
  - Don't setup IPVS config with real and virtual servers ports
    different.  If the real server is using DR or TUN, the port of
    the real server must be the same as the port of the virtual
    server. This commit uses the virtual server port for the real
    server when configuring IPVS.
  - Log warnings if real server and virtual server ports don't
    match This commit adds logging warnings if virtual and real
    server ports, when using TUN or DR, don't match.  It also sets
    the real server ports to be the same as the virtual server
    ports. Although listing the IPVS configuration with ipvsadm
    will look different, the kernel ignored the port of a real
    server when using DR or TUN, so the behaviour isn't changed,
    but when looking at the configuration it now shows what is
    actually happening.
  - Fix warning when protocol specified for virtual server with
    fwmark.
  - Add log message that nb_get_retry is deprecated.
  - Fix whitespace in configure.ac.
  - Fix configure error when systemd not installed configure was
    trying to execute pkg-config --variable=systemdsystemunitdir
    systemd even if systemd was not available.  This commit makes
    configure only execute the above if it has determined that
    systemd is the correct init package to use.
  - Correct references to RFC6527 (VRRPv3 SNMP RFC).
  - nsure checker->has_run is always set once a checker has run.
  - Fix some indentation in configure.ac.
  - Update fopen_safe() to open temporary file in destination
    directory rename() in fopen_safe() was failing if the file
    being created was not on the same filesystem as /tmp.
  - Add ${_RANDOM} configuration keyword.  It might seem strange to
    introduce random elements to configuration files, but it can be
    useful for testing.
  - Fix using ~SEQ() in multiline configuration definitions.
  - Make blank lines terminate a multiline definition.
  - Minor updates for lvs_flush_on_stop.
  - Add option to skip deleting real servers on shutdown or reload
    If a virtual server is removed, the kernel will remove its real
    servers, so keepalived doesn't explicitly need to do so.  The
    lvs_flush_onstop option removes all LVS configuration, whereas
    this new option will only remove the virtual servers managed by
    keepalived.
  - Correct error message re checker_log_all_failures.
  - Fix syntax error in configure.ac.
  - Fix track_process initialisation for processes with PIDs
    starting 9.
  - Remove debugging log message.
  - Remove inappropriate function const attributes They were
    causing iptables/ipsets not to be initialised.
  - Stop warning: function might be candidate for attribute
    â€˜constâ€™ Depending on what configure options are selected,
    gcc can output the above warning for
    initialise_debug_options().  This commit ensures that the
    warning is not produced.
  - Enable strict-config-checks option in keepalived.spec RPM file.
  - vrrp: relax attribute 'const' warning at iptables helpers.
  - Propagate libm to KA_LIBS.
  - Fix building on Alpine Linux.  Alpine (musl) doesn't have a
    definition of __GNU_PREREQ, so create a dummy definition.

Wed Apr  3 13:52:51 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- add buildrequires for file-devel
  - used in the checker to verify scripts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  3 13:46:22 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.14
  - Add compiler warning -Wfloat-conversion and fix new warnings.
    It was discovered that passing 0.000001 as a parameter
    specified as uint32_t to a function did not generate any
    warning of type mismatch, or loss of precision.  This commit
    adds -Wfloat-conversion and fixes 3 instances of new warnings
    that were generated.
  - For non systemd enviroment, it occurs syntax error 'fi'.  To
    avoid syntax error, modify keepalived.spec.in.
  - When uninstall keepalived with init upstart, stop keepalived
    process.
  - Fix type re LOG_INGO should be LOG_INFO - 6git stash --cached.
    The code was actualy in a #ifdef INCLUDE_UNUSED_CODE block, and
    so isn't currently compiled.
  - Register missing thread function for thread debugging.
  - Fix reutrn value of notify_script_compare misusing issue.
  - Fix typo in keepalived.conf man page re BFD min_rx.
  - Fix segfault when bfd process reloads config.  Issue #1145
    reported the bdf process was segfaulting when reloading.  The
    bfd process was freeing and allocating a new thread_master_t
    when reloading, which doesn't work. This commit changes the bfd
    process to clean and reinitialise the thread_master_t.
  - Fix segfault in handle_proc_ev().  On Linux 3.10 the ack bit
    can be set in a connector message, and the CPU number is set to
    UINT32_MAX. This commit skips acks, and also checks that CPU
    number is within range of the number of CPUs on the system.
  - Fix OpenSSL init failure with OpenSSL v1.1.1.  OpenSSL v1.1.1,
    but not v1.1.0h or v1.1.1b failed in SSL_CTX_new() if
    OPENSSL_init_crypto(OPENSSL_INIT_NO_LOAD_CONFIG) had previously
    been called.  This commit doesn't call OPENSSL_init_crypto() if
    doing so causes SSL_CTX_new() to fail.
  - Remove all references to libnfnetlink.  Commit 2899da6 (Stop
    using linbl for mcast group membership and setting rx buf
    sizes) stopped using libnfnetlink, but INSTALL and
    keepalived.spec.in were not updated accordingly.
  - Fix genhash re OPENSSL_init_crypto bug and improve
    configure.ac.  Commit fe6d6ac (Fix OpenSSL init failure with
    OpenSSL v1.1.1) didn't update the identical code in
    genhash/ssl.c. Also, an improvement for the test in
    configure.ac was suggested.
  - Fix log output when real server removed.  FMT_VS() and FMT_RS()
    both call inet_sockaddrtotrio which uses a static buffer to
    return the formatted string, but since FMT_VS(), wheich simply
    calls format_vs() copies the returned string to its own static
    buffer, if FMT_VS() was called before FMT_RS() then the
    returned strings from both could be used.  The problem occurs
    when both FMT_VS() and FMT_RS() are used as parameters to
    log_message() (or printf etc). It appeared to work fine on
    x86_64, but was writing the same IP address for both the real
    server and virtual server on ARM architectures. This is due to
    the compiler evaluating parameters to the log_message()
    function call in a different order on the different
    architectures.  This commit adds inet_sockaddrtotrio_r() which
    allows the output to be in a buffer specified by the caller,
    and so FMT_VS() and FMT_RS() can now be called in either order
    without one overwriting a buffer used by the other.
  - Streamline some string formatting with FMT_RS() and FMR_VS().
    Following commit 9fe353d (Fix log output when real server
    removed) some code can be streamlined now that the order of
    calling FMT_VS() and FMT_RS() does not matter.
  - Replace FMT_HTTP_RS(), FMT_TCP_RS() and FMT_DNS_RS() with
    FMT_CHK().  They were all simply defined to be FMT_CHK() so
    just replace them with that. This made it much simpler to find
    all used of FMT_CHK().
  - Fix building with gcc 4.4.7 (Centos 6.5).  gcc v4.4.7 doesn't
    support -Wfloat-conversion, so check for it at configure time.
  - Add dumping checker config/status when receive SIGUSR1.
  - Don't put alpha mode checkers into failed state at reload If a
    new checker is added at a reload, unless the real server aleady
    has failed checkers, then ignore the alpha mode of the checker.
    This means that the real server, if up, won't be taken down and
    then brought back up again almost straight away. If the real
    server already has failed checkers, then setting an alpha mode
    checker down initially won't take down the real server, so we
    can allow the alpha mode setting to apply.
  - Handle alpha mode checkers initial failure at startup better.
  - Fix compile failure discovered by Travis-CI.
  - Fix calling syslog when not using signalfd().  Pull request
    #1149 identified that syslog is AS-Unsafe (see signal-safety
    man page), and that therefore signals should be blocked when
    calling it.  This commit blocks signals when calling
    syslog()/vsyslog() when signalfd() is not being used.
  - Rationalise function attributes.
  - Fix enable-optimise configure option.
  - Use AS_HELP_STRING for all options in configure.ac.
  - Streamline genhash -h option.
  - Make genhash -v version match keepalived.
  - Fix config check of virtual server quorum against weights of
    real servers.
  - Fix some configure tested checks for OPENSSL_init_crypto.
  - Add infrastructure for adding additional compiler warnings.
  - Add standard and extra compiler warnings.
  - Add and resolve missing-declarations and missing-prototypes
    warnings Approximately 16 additional functions are now declared
    static.
  - Add and resolve old-style-definitions warnings
  - Add and resolve redundant-decls warnings
  - Add and resolve jump-misses-init warnings
  - Add and resolve shadow warnings
  - Add and resolve unsuffixed-float-constants warnings
  - Add and resolve suggest-attribute=const warnings
  - Add and resolve suggest-attribute=format warnings
  - Add and resolve suggest-attribute=malloc warnings
  - Add and resolve suggest-attribute=noreturn warnings
  - Add and resolve suggest-attribute=pure warnings
  - Add and resolve unused-macros warnings
  - Add and resolve null-dereference warnings
  - Add and resolve float-equal warnings
  - Add and resolve stack-protector warnings
  - Add and resolve strict-overflow=4 warnings
  - Add and resolve pointer-arith warnings This particularly
    includes adding a number of bytes to a void -.
  - Add and resolve cast-qual warnings
  - Resolve additional warnings identified on Centos 6.5/gcc 4.4.7
  - Remove static from zalloc()
  - Fix some compiler warnings on Ubuntu Xenial, and add comments
    re others.
  - Rename LIST parameters to lst in list_head.h to avoid upper
    case.
  - Fix real server checkers moving from failed to OK on reload.
  - add rs judgement in migrate_checkers.
  - Detect connection failure in genhash and exit rather than loop.
  - Add another function pure attribute.
  - Fix sending notifies for vrrp instances at startup when in sync
    group Issue #1155 idenfified that notify scripts for vrrp
    instance transition to backup state when keepalived started up
    were not being sent if the vrrp instance was in a sync group.
    It was also the case that SNMP traps, SMTP alerts and FIFO
    notifies were not being sent either.  This commit make
    keepalived send the initial notifies when the vrrp instance is
    in a sync group.
  - Fix building keepalived RPM on Fedora 26.  For some reason
    -fPIC is needed when testing for the presence of setns().
  - Add vrrp_startup_delay configuration option.  Some systems that
    start keepalived at boot time need to delay the startup of the
    vrrp instances, due to network interfaces taking time to
    properly come up. This commit adds a global configuration
    option vrrp_startup_delay that delays the vrrp instances
    starting up, for the specified number of seconds.
  - Handle checkers properly when reload immediately after startup.
  - Streamline some of the SMTP checker code.
  - Create separate checker for each host in SMTP_CHECK block
    Having multiple host entries in an SMTP_CHECK block is
    deprecated.  This commit streamlines the SMTP_CHECK code by
    creating a separate SMTP checker for each host declared in the
    SMTP_CHECK block, so that apart from parsing the configuration,
    the code no longer handles multiple hosts per checker.  The
    support for parsing configuration with multiple hosts is only
    enabled if WITH_HOST_ENTRIES is defined in check_smtp.c. It is
    currently enabled, but when support for multiple hosts in the
    SMTP_CHECK block is finally removed, it will simply be a matter
    of deleting all code in the WITH_HOST_ENTRIES conditional
    blocks.
  - Make checker fail if ENETUNREACH returned by connect().  The
    connect() call can return some immediate errors such as
    ENETUNREACH.  These were not being treated as a failure of the
    checker, since the code used to assume that any non success
    return by connect() meant that the connection was in progress.
    keepalived will now treat ENETUNREACH, EHOSTUNREACH,
    ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTDOWN, ENETDOWN, ECONNRESET, ECONNABORTED,
    ETIMEDOUT, when returned by connect(), as meaning that the
    checker has failed.
  - Don't set SO_LINGER with a timeout of 0 SO_LINGER with a
    timeout of 0 causes a TCP connection to be reset rather than
    cleanly closed. Instead of specifying a timeout of 0, use 5
    seconds, so that there is an orderly shutdown of the TCP
    connection, but the close socket doesn't remain in TIMED_WAIT
    state for more than a short time.
  - nftables: fix build with kernel lower than 4.1.
  - Remove dead code and cosmectics.  Remove code marked as UNUSED
    where things simply go nowhere even if define is set. We keep
    for the moment UNUSED code related to debug helpers used during
    coding process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 20 23:31:55 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.13
  - Add BFD build option to keepalived.spec rpm file
    Issue #1114 identified that the keepalived.spec file was not being
    generated to build BFD support even if keepalived had been configured
    to support it.
  - Copy tarball to rpmbuild/SOURCES when building in place
    It seems that even when building in place, rpmbuild expects the
    tarball to be in the rpmbuild/SOURCES directory.
  - Fix configure check for __always_inline
  - Handle interface MAC addresses changing
    When an interface is added to a bond interface, if it is the first
    interface added, the MAC address of the bond interface is changed
    to the MAC address of the added interface. When subsequent interfaces
    are added, their MAC addresses are changed to that of the bond
    interface.
    Issue #1112 identified that if a bond interface is deleted and
    recreated, the gratuitous ARPs were sent with the wrong source MAC
    address.
    This commit now updates interface MAC addresses from the netlink
    RTM_NEWLINK messages, so that the correct MAC address is always
    used.
  - Minor tidying up of opening gratuitous ARP socket.
  - Streamline setting SOCK_NONBLOCK on vrrp sockets.
  - Use netlink reported hardware address length for unsolicited NAs
    ETH_ALEN is correct for Ethernet type interaces, but is not right
    for Infiniband interfaces.
  - Minor tidying up of opening gratuitous NA socket.
  - Make gratuitous ARP/NA sockets non blocking
    keepalived shouldn't block when sending gratutious ARP/NA messages.
    It is better to lose the messages than for keepalived to block, so
    set the sockets non blocking.
  - Use netlink provided broadcast address for gratuitous ARP
    If an interface has a non-standard broadcast address, we should
    honour it.
  - Fix building on pre 3.10 kernels re track_process
    Issue #1119 reported that keepalived wouldn't build on CentOS 6.
    Various PROC_EVENT_- declarations were assumed to exist, some of which
    were not introduced until Linux v3.10. Most of them are not needed, but
    PROC_EVENT_COMM is used by the track_process code.
    This commit now checks for the existence of the PROC_EVENT_- declarations,
    but since keepalived uses PROC_EVENT_COMM, track_process is not supported
    prior to Linux v3.2.
  - Make track_process work prior to Linux 3.2, but with limitations
    Prior to Linux 3.2 the PROC_EVENT_COMM event did not exist, which
    means that keepalived is unable to detect changes to process name
    (/proc/PID/comm) prior to Linux 3.2. most processes do not change
    their process name, and so using track_process prior to Linux 3.2
    is safe so long as the monitored processes are known not to change
    their process name.
  - Stop configure failing when nftables is not supported.
  - Streamline socket use with linkbeat.
    Previously the socket used for ioctls was opened and closed twice per
    poll if using MII or ETHTOOL polling, and once per poll if using ioctl
    polling. This commit opens the socket once at startup, uses that socket
    for all linkbeat polls, and closes it on termination.
  - Enable linkbeat polling to work with dynamic interfaces.
  - Add linkbeat_interfaces configuration block
    It was not possible to indicate that an interface that wasn't used
    as the interface of a vrrp instance, but was used either as a track
    interface, or for virtual/static ip addresses or routes should use
    linkbeat. This commit adds that capability.
  - Add ability to specify linkbeat type in linkbeat_interfaces block.
  - Add --disable-linkbeat configure option
    Does anyone use linkbeat anymore? This commit enables keepalived to
    be build without the linkbeat code.
  - Don't remove link local IPv6 address from VMAC that isn't keepalived's
    If IFLA_INET6_ADDR_GEN_MODE isn't supported and a macvlan interface
    already had a (non-default) link local addresss and the link local
    address that matched the interface's MAC address was added, keepalived
    was removing it as soon as it was added. This commit stop keepalived
    removing the address when we shouldn't.
  - Set configure init type correctly in keepalived.spec file.
  - Fix handling of VMACs with multiple reloads
    If a configuration is loaded that has a VRRP instance using a VMAC,
    then the configuration is updated to remove that VRRP instance and
    keepalived reloads its configuration, then the configuration is
    updated again to reinstate the VRRP instance and the configuration
    is again reloaded, keepalived thought the VMAC interface still
    existed, whereas it was deleted following the first reload.
    This commit ensures that keepalived properly detects whether an
    interface exists following a reload.
  - Remember more than one interface local address per interface
    Keepalived needs a local address for each interface it sends adverts
    on. If the address keepalived is using is deleted and another address
    is configured on the interface, then keepalived should start using
    that address. To do this, a list of configured address on each
    interfaces needs to be maintained.
  - Don't consider VIPs as local addresses when restart after crash
    Keepalived maintains a list of addresses per interface that can be
    used as source adddresses for adverts. To build the list, keepalived
    reads the addresses configured on interfaces when it starts. However,
    if keepalived crashed it will have left VIPs configured on interfaces,
    and we don't want to use them as advert source addresses.
    This commit makes keepalived compare the addresses on interfaces
    to VIPs, and ignores any addresses that are VIPs.
  - Fix removing left over VIPs at startup.
  - Use read_timer() when parsing config where appropriate.
  - Allow fractional warmup, delay_loop and delay_before_retry for checkers
    To shorten the real server monitoring interval, make it possible to specify
    decimal value for following items:
    warmup
    delay_loop
    delay_before_retry
  - Update connect_timeout configuration options
    Based on the patch submitted by tamu.0.0.tamu@gmail.com this patch
    allows setting the connect_timeout to a resolution of micro-seconds.
    The patch also adds the ability to set a default value at the virtual
    server and real server levels.
  - Fix unused variable warning when building only with RFC compliant
    SNMP.
  - It enable to set zero value as mintime for delay_loop and connect_timeout.
  - Add option not to check for EINTR if using signalfd()
    If keepalived is using signalfd(), there are no asynchronous signal
    handlers, and therefore EINTR cannot be returned.
    Currently the check for EINTR is enabled by default, and configure
    option --disable-eintr-debug disables the check, while
    --enable-eintr-debug enables writing log entries if EINTR is returned.
    Once sufficient testing has been performed, the default will be
    changed not to test for EINTR if signalfd() is supported.
  - Make checking for EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK consistent
    The code in some places checked errno for EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK
    and in other places only checked EAGAIN. On Linux EAGAIN == EWOULDBLOCK,
    so the check is not necessary, but EAGAIN is not guaranteed to be the
    same value as EWOULDBLOCK, so define check_EAGAIN that only checks EAGAIN
    if they are the same value, but checks both if they are different.
  - Ensure default connection timeout for smtp checker hosts set.
  - Set default connection timeout if no smtp check host specified.
  - Fix min timer value, zero to 0.000001Sec.
  - Add fixing min time for vs_co_timeout_handler() and rs_co_timeout_handler().
  - Fix parameter of read_timer(), it treat Mintime and Maxtime as microseconds.
  - vrrp: vrrp_dispatcher_read() performance extension
    We took time with Quentin to simulate and rework this code. We introduced
    2 imbricated while loop:
    (1) First one is catching recvfrom EINTR (this code trig
        only on kernel older than 2.6.22 where signalfd was firstly introduced).
        Newer kernel will immediately break the loop (hey guys: if you are running
        older than 2.6.22 it is worth considering upgrading).
    (2) Second loop will continue reading from socket until same VRID advert
        has been received during the same cycle. After simulating, it appears that
        during contention with a lot of VRRP instances (around 1500), this design
        is needed to relax socket recvq from growing. This can be viewed as a
        Poll-Mode activation during contention and fallback to regular I/O MUX
        during normal operations. This loop breaks immediately and re-submit
        opration to I/O MUX when there is no more to be read.
  - Fix conversion from long for double in read_timer().
  - Remove variable timer of unsigned long cast in read_timer().
    When Double type variable timer is cast to long type, it's scale falls.
- changes from2.0.12
  - Documentation related.
    Remove keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS content to make a pointer to manpage.
    Update README manifest to reflect actual Keepalived goal and features.
  - Improve error message if process events connector not enabled in
    kernel.
  - Add option to disable track-process functionality
    Issue #1099 reported that their kernel did not support the proc events
    connector, and it would therefore be helpful to have an option to build
    keepalived without the track-process functionality.
    This commit adds the --disable-track-process configure option.
  - Fix vrrp instances going to fault state when have virtual routes
    If an interface going down caused a vrrp instance to go to fault
    state, and the vrrp instance also had virtual routes, the state
    of the vrrp instance would be set to backup when the deletion of
    the virtual route was detected. This commit ensures that the vrrp
    instance stays in fault state until the interface is brought up
    again.
  - Remove Red Hat Linux 9 and RH Enterprise Linux 3 from spec file.
    Red Hat Linux 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 are both based on
    Linux 2.4, which is no longer supported by keepalived. The options
    in the spec file for Reh Hat Linux 9 have twice caused people to
    specify wrong options to configure when trying to build keepalived,
    so the options are removed to i) avoid confusion and ii) they are
    not longer relevant.
  - Add global option vrrp_min_garp.
    By default keepalived sends 5 gratuitous ARP/NA messages after
    transitioning to master, and 5 more 5 seconds later. This isn't
    necessary with modern switches, and so if the vrrp_min_garp option
    is set, only one gratuitious ARP/NA message is sent after transition
    to master, and no repeat messages are sent 4 seconds later.
  - Standardise definition of _INCLUDE_UNUSED_CODE_
  - Remove out of date comment re VRRP over IPv6.
  - Correct typo in keepalived.conf.5.
  - Directly use structure sizes for packet header lengths.
  - vrrp_state_fault_rx() is not used.
    Wrap the function in conditional compilation so it is not compiled
  - Convert so list loops to use LIST_FOREACH.
  - Don't recalculate vrrp packet header address.
    vrrp_get_header() calculates the address of the vrrp header in a
    received packet, but it was being recalculated in vrrp_in_chk().
    This commit passes the already calculated address to vrrp_in_chk().
  - Ensure a received packet has an AH header if and only if AH auth.
    Ensure that a received packet has an AH header if we expect AH
    authentication, and doesn't have an AH header if we don't expect
    AH authentication.
  - Ensure all protocol headers received before return pointer to vrrp header
    vrrp_get_header() returns a pointer to the vrrp header, but it now returns
    NULL if insufficient data has been received to include all the (IP,
    possibly AH, and VRRP) headers (this does not include the VIPs in the VRRP
    packet).
    This means that when a pointer to the VRRP header is returned, all fields in
    all protocol headers can safely be accessed.
  - Add check of received IPv6 hop count in multicast adverts
    The VRRP RFC requires that IPv6 hop count MUST be checked to be 255,
    just as the TTL for IPv6 must be 255. Previously that wasn't being
    checked, since IPv6 raw sockets don't provide access to the IPv6
    header.
    Using recvmsg() rather than recvfrom(), and setting socket option
    IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT allows keepalived to receive the hop count as
    ancillary data, and that can now be checked.
  - Improve reading from vrrp receive sockets.
    Previously no check was made of the return value from recvfrom()/
    recvmsg(). This meant than an error could occur (e.g. EINTR), or no
    data might be returned, and keepalived would still attempt to process
    the receive buffer as though data had been received.
  - Enhance and streamline checking of validity of received VRRP packet
    This includes checking that a packet is multicast, unless unicast is
    expected in which case it is checked for unicast, ensuring that if
    AH authentication is used, the next header protocol is VRRP.
    The sequence of some checks is revised to ensure that the fields being
    checked are valid to be accessed prior to accessing them, e.g. check
    that the packet is VRRP version 2 before checking the authentication.
  - Stop clearing receive buffer before receiving VRRP packets.
    This is no longer necessary now that the appropriate checks are
    made of the return status of recvmsg(), and also that the checks
    of received packet length and packet headers now do all necessary
    checks.
  - Add compile time checks for IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT/IPV6_RECVPKTINFO
    support.
  - Update keepalived.spec.in build-requires.
    The kernel package required for building keepalived is kernel-headers
    not kernel-devel. Also, it is superfluous to have package kernel in
    the build-requires!
  - Add missing file (build.setup) to tarball.
  - Fix calculating print format to rlim_t in configure.ac.
  - Fix compiler warnings on 32 bit systems re HASH_UPDATE.
    Removing all the casts stopped the warnings.
  - Use PRI_rlim_t when printing rlim_t types.
  - Use %zd/%zu for ssize_t/size_t to avoid warnings on 32 bit systems.
  - Fix some space/tab formatting.
  - Stop declaring some timer definitions unsigned to stop compiler
    warnings.
    TIMER_HZ, TIMER_CENTI_HZ, NSEC_PER_SEC were causing some compiler warnings
    on some systems due to being defined with a 'U' unsigned suffix. Removing
    the unsigned specifier stopped the compiler warnings.
  - Fix compiler warning due to incorrect format specifier.
    An int64_t should use % PRIi64 and not %ld
  - Stop an uninitialized variable compiler warning.
  - Fix MEM_CHECK debugging on processors without unaligned memory
    access.
  - Don't attempt to use unopened socket for getting ipset version.
  - Tidy up an error message.
  - vrrp: make vrrp_dispatcher_read() async while catching error.
    During investigations we decided to update previous patch to resubmit
    into I/O MUX on read error. It will make read procedure I/O MUX freindly
    by removing potential sync operation potentially leading to a global
    I/O MUX desync. We aggreed, the situation is really and very exceptionnal
    but could happen.
  - vrrp: vrrp_arp_thread split.
    Split the function for maintainability purpose.

Fri Jan 18 15:39:47 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.11
  - Fix segfault while shutting down when SNMP activity occurs.
    Issue #1061 identified that keepalived could segfault when it
    shut down. It appears that this was caused by data being
    received on the file descriptors that the snmp agent requests
    keepalived to monitor with epoll(). Since the read threads
    weren't being processed during a shutdown, the first time an
    snmp fd was ready, keepalived discarded the read thread. The
    second time that fd became ready there was no thread to handle
    the fd, and, since the assert() statement was not compiled in,
    non existant data was queued to the thread ready queue.  This
    commit changes the assert() calls to continue, so that non
    existant data is no longer queued to the thread ready queue.
  - While shutting down, continue to handle snmp agent fds.  Since
    we don't shutdown the snmp connection until the very end of the
    shutdown process (we need to be able to send snmp traps), we
    should continue to handle the snmp fds on behalf of the snmp
    agent while shutting down.
  - Ensure snmp agent is in correct state when initialising/closing
    Make sure the snmp agent is not already initialised before
    initialising it, and make sure it has been initialised before
    closing it.
  - Disable asserts in bfd code by default and add --enable-asserts
    Asserts were enabled by default in the bfd code, which
    shouldn't be the case.  Add --enable-asserts configure option
    so that the asserts tests can be enabled while debugging.
  - Remove debugging log message accidently left in.
  - Update receive buffers when interface is created.  The receive
    buffer size used by keepalived is based on the largest MTU of
    any interface that keepalived uses. If dynamic interfaces are
    being used and an interface is created after keepalived has
    started, the MTU of the new interface may be larger than the
    previous largest, so the receive buffer may need to be
    increased in size.  Further, if vrrp_rx_bufs_policy is MTU,
    then the kernel receive buffers on the receive socket may need
    to be increased.
  - Handle MTU sizes being changed.  Issue #1068 identified that
    the MTU size wasn't being updated in keepalived if it changed.
    This commit now updates the MTU size and adjusts receive buffer
    sizes accordingly.
  - Fix syntax error in configure.ac.
  - Fix double free when global data smtp_helo_name copied from
    local_name Issue #1071 identified a double free fault. It
    occurred when smtp_helo_name was not set, in which case it was
    set to point to the same malloc'd memory as local_name. At
    termination keepalived freed both local_name and
    smtp_helo_name.  If keepalived needs to use local_name for
    smtp_helo_name it now malloc's additional memory to copy the
    string into.
  - Rename TIMER_MAX to TIMER_MAXIMUM.  ulibC defines TIMER_MAX, so
    to avoid naming conflict rename it.  This issue was reported by
    Paul Gildea <gildeap@tcd.ie> who also provided the patch.
  - Fix segfault when smtp alerts configured.
  - First working version of nftables.
  - Restructed code around how iptables/nftables are called This
    commit also allows building keepalived without iptables
    support, thereby allowing only nftables support.  Adding any
    other mechanism to handle no_accept mode, i.e. blocking
    receiving and sending to/from VIPs should be added to
    vrrp_firewall.c, in a similar way to how nftables/iptables are
    used.
  - Update doc files re nftables.
  - Make nftables handle dont_track_primary appropriately.
  - Fix config reload with nftables.
  - Set base chain priorities from configuration.
  - Use iptables by default if neither iptables or nftables
    configured.  But if the build of keepalived does not include
    iptables, then use nftables default.
  - Stop dumping keywords - left turned on after debugging.
  - Make umask configuration apply to created file.
  - Add libmnl and libnftnl to travis file.
  - Fix compilation failure when NFTNL_EXPR_LOOKUP_FLAGS not
    defined.
  - Fix compilation failure when build with nftables but without
    iptables.
  - Fix order of include files in configure COLLISION test.  Since
    Linux 4.4.11 (commit 1575c09) including linux/if.h after
    net/if.h works, whereas until glibc fix their headers including
    net/if.h after linux/if.h causes compiler redefinition errors.
    Unfortunately the test for the collision was done the wrong way
    round, as identified in issue #1079. The patch included in the
    issue report corrects the order of inclusion of the header
    files.  What we should do is ensure that glibc header files are
    included before Linux header files, so that at least if kernel
    headers from 4.4.11 onwards are used, the conflict will not
    occur.
  - Set CLOEXEC on netlink sockets.
  - Correct error message for invalid route metric.
  - Add track_process for vrrp to monitor if another process is
    running.  Configurations frequently include a track_script to
    check that a process is running, often haproxy or nginx. Using
    any of pgrep, pkill, killall, pidof, etc, has an overhead of
    reading all /proc/[1-9]*/status and/or /proc/[1-9]*/cmdline
    files. In particular reading the cmdline files has a
    significant overhead on a system that is swapping, since the
    cmdline files provide access to part of the address space of
    each process, which may need to be fetched from the swap space.
    This commit reads the /proc/[1-9]*/stat and/or the
    /proc/[1-9]*/cmdline files only when keepalived starts, and
    after that uses the process events connector to track process
    creation and termination.  keepalived will ignore zombie
    processes, whereas pgrep etc include them.  A minimum number of
    instances of a process can be specified, and also a delay so
    that if a process is restarted, it won't cause monitoring vrrp
    instances to immediately transition to fault state but to wait
    the configured time and it the monitored process starts again
    it won't transition to fault state.  There are potential
    difficulties with the process event connector if a large number
    of process events occur very rapidly, since there can be a
    receive buffer overrun on the netlink socket. This code will
    detect that happening, increase the receive buffer size, and
    reread the processes from /proc.
  - Add missing #include to track_process.c.
  - Fix number of elements of fd_set read for snmp select info.
  - Remove thread_event_t when EPOLL_CTL_DEL fails.  If snmpd
    closes a file descriptor, when keepalived attempts to
    unregister the fd from epoll an error is returned. However, we
    still need to remove the thread_event_t from the io_events
    rbtree.
  - Fix connection to snmpd after it has to reconnect.  Issue #1080
    identified that keepalived wasn't handling a connection failure
    and reconnect to snmpd properly. The problem was created when
    the change from select() to epoll() was made.  This commit
    makes keepalived unregister and reregister the snmp file
    descriptors after snmpd reconnects.
  - Fix retry count for SMTP_CHECK checker.  The checker was doing
    one too few retries.
  - Make healthchecker failure reporting consistent Some
    healthcheckers were reporting all failures, and others only
    when the retries expired. This commit by default makes the
    checkers only report failure when the retries expire, unless
    the global keyword checker_log_all_failures or log_all_failures
    on the specific checker is configured.
  - After reload, reinitialise current track processes state.
  - Remove unused variable in track_process.c.
  - Add configure checks re --with-kernel-dir.
  - Convert remaining select() to epoll_wait().  keepalived was
    using select() for handling the termination of child processes,
    but the main scheduling loop now uses epoll_wait(), so convert
    the select() to epoll_wait() from consistency.
  - Stop keepalived leaving zombie child processes.  keepalived
    wasn't reaping the termination of its child processes, so this
    commit adds waitpid() calls once it knows the processes have
    terminated.
  - Fix make distclean and make distcheck.
  - Also skip route not configured with down interface.  Otherwise,
    if keepalived has virtual_routes configured, we create a
      virtual interface and bring it up and down, current code will
      bring VRRP state to FAULT and never return.
  - Stop vrrp process entering infinite loop when track script
    times out Issue #1093 identified that the vrrp process was
    entering an infinite loop after a track script timed out. This
    was due to a child process thread having an RB tree for PIDs as
    well as for the timeout, and if a child process timed out, the
    thread wasn't being removed from the PID RB tree. This commit
    now ensures it is removed.
  - Fix the abbreviation of Shortest Expected Delay.
  - Don't free unallocated memory if not tracking processes.
  - vrrp: Rewrote JSON code Remove dependency to json-c extralib by
    using a simple streaming JSON writter.  Refactored code to make
    it simple to maintain.
  - vrrp: Fix JSON handling for v{route;rule}.
  - autoconf: fix nftables selection We need to inhibit nftable
    compilation if compiling system has kernel header file
    nf_tables.h but not libnftnl nor libmnl.

- update to 2.0.10
  - Fix compiling on Alpine Linux.
  - Stop printf compiler warning on Alpine Linux due to rlim_t. 
  - manpage cosmetic.
  - Fix removing snmpd read threads when snmpd becomes unavailable.
  - Update to support libipset version 7.
  - Use ipset_printf for ipset messages so can go to log. 
  - When opening files for write, ensure files can only be read by
    root.  Issue #1048 referred to CVE-2018-19046 regarding files
    used for debugging purposes could potentially be read by non
    root users.  This commit ensures that such log files cannot be
    opened by non root users.
  - Disable fopen_safe() append mode by default If a non privileged
    user creates /tmp/keepalived.log and has it open for read (e.g.
    tail -f), then even though keepalived will change the owner to
    root and remove all read/write permissions from non owners, the
    application which already has the file open will be able to
    read the added log entries.  Accordingly, opening a file in
    append mode is disabled by default, and only enabled if
    --enable-smtp-alert-debug or --enable-log-file (which are
    debugging options and unset by default) are enabled.  This
    should further alleviate security concerns related to
    CVE-2018-19046.
  - vrrp: add support to constant time memcmp.  Just an update to
    use best practise security design pattern. While comparing
    password or hmac you need to ensure comparison function is time
    constant in order to figth against any timing attacks. We turn
    off potential compiler optimizations for this particular
    function to avoid any short circuit.
  - Make sure a non privileged user cannot read keepalived file
    output Ensure that when a file such as /tmp/keepalived.data is
    written, no non privileged can have a previous version of that
    file already open, thereby allowing them to read the data.
    This should fully resolve CVE-2018-19046.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  9 16:07:40 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.9
  - Fix updating a timer thread's timeout.  Issue #1042 identified
    that the BFD process could segfault. This was tracked down to a
    timer thread which had already expired having its timeout
    updated by timer_thread_update_timeout().  The sands timer
    should only be updated if the thread is on a waiting queue, and
    not if it has already timed out or it is unused.
  - Don't requeue read thread if it is not waiting.  This update
    matches commit 09a2a37 - Fix updating a timer thread's timeout
    should.
  - Allow BFD instance to recover after send error.  If sendto
    failed in bfd_send_packet(), the bfd instance was put into
    admin down state, but there was no means for the bfd instance
    to transition out of admin down state.  This commit makes
    keepalived log the first instance of a sequence of failures to
    send a bfd packet, but does not bring the bfd instance down in
    case the error is a transient error. If the error is longer
    lasting, the remote system will timeout, transition to down
    state, and send a message saying it is down.  Once the bfd
    instance can start sending again the bfd instance can now
    transition again to up state.
  - Make DGB definition use log_message() rather than syslog().
  - Fix building with --enable-debug configure option.
  - Start list of required kernel features in INSTALL file.  Issue
    #1024 asked what kernel features are needed to support
    keepalived.  The simple answer was that it isn't recorded
    anywhere, so this is a start of making a list of the features
    required.
  - Make list_remove() call list free function and add
    list_transfer().  If an element is being removed from a list,
    the free function should be called.  list_transfer() allows a
    list element to be moved from one list to another without
    freeing and reallocating the list element control information.
  - Add mem_check diagnostics re calling functions of list
    functions.  When using mem_check, mallocs and frees were
    recorded against the list functions, and the originating
    functions weren't identified.  This patch adds recording of the
    functions calling the list functions so that the originating
    function is identified.
  - Simplify the processing of comments in configuration files.
    This commit moves the handling (and removal) of comments to a
    single function (called from read_line()) which simplifies the
    processing of config files.
  - Add ~SEQ(start, step, end) config functionality Where a
    configuration has repeated blocks of configuration where the
    only thing that changes is a numeric value (e.g. for VRIDs from
    1 to 255) this allows the block to be defined once, and a
    single line using ~SEQ can then generate all the blocks.
  - Use REALLOC when building a multiline definition.  The code
    used to use MALLOC, strcpy() and FREE, but REALLOC can do all
    this for us.
  - Improve mem-check diagnostics.  When using an allocation list
    of over 50,000 entries, it was quite slow searching thtough all
    the entries to find the matching memory allocation, and to find
    free entries. This commit changes to using malloc() to create
    entries, and a red-black tree to hold the entries. It also has
    a separate list of free entries.  This commit also adds 4 more
    types of memory allocation error, and improves the consistency
    of the entries in the log files.
  - Don't attempt to delete VMAC when underlying interface is
    deleted.  If the underlying interface of one of our vmacs is
    deleted, and we know the vmac has been deleted, don't attempt
    to delete it again.
  - Include master state in determining if vmacs are up or down
    Netlink doesn't send messages for a state change of a macvlan
    when the master device changes state, so we have to track that
    for ourselves.
  - Turn off parser debugging.
  - Make test/mk_if create iptables chains.
  - Handle interfaces not existing when keepalived terminates.  If
    the underlying interface of a vmac we created has been deleted,
    the vmac will not exist so don't attempt to delete it again.
    Also, don't attempt to reset the configuration of the
    underlying interface.
  - Handle the underlying interface of a macvlan interface going
    up/down.  The kernel doesn't send netlink messages for macvlans
    going up or down when the underlying interface transitions (it
    doesn't even update their status to say they are up/down), but
    the interfaces don't work. We need to track the state of the
    underlying interfaces and propagate that to the macvlan
    interfaces.
  - Fix duplicate value in track_t enum.
  - Fix check for matching track types.
  - Treat macvtap interfaces in the same way as macvlan interfaces.
  - Improve handling of interfaces not existing when keepalived
    starts.
  - Fix handling interface deletion and creation of vmacs on
    macvlan i/fs.
  - When interface created, open sockets on it if used by VRRP
    directly If an interface is created that has vrrp instances
    configured on it that don't use VMACs, or use vmac_xmit_base,
    then the raw sockets must be opened.
  - Force seeing a transition to up state when an interface is
    created.
  - Fix netlink remnant data error.
  - Add command line and configuration option to set umask.  Issue
    #1048 identified that files created by keepalived are created
    with mode 0666. This commit changes the default to 0644, and
    also allows the umask to be specified in the configuration or
    as a command line option.
  - Fix compile warning introduced in commit c6247a9.  Commit
    c6247a9 - "Add command line and configuration option to set
    umask" introduced a compile warning, although the code would
    have worked OK.
  - When opening files for write, ensure they aren't symbolic
    links.  Issue #1048 identified that if, for example, a non
    privileged user created a symbolic link from
    /etc/keepalvied.data to /etc/passwd, writing to
    /etc/keepalived.data (which could be invoked via DBus) would
    cause /etc/passwd to be overwritten.  This commit stops
    keepalived writing to pathnames where the ultimate component is
    a symbolic link, by setting O_NOFOLLOW whenever opening a file
    for writing.  This might break some setups, where, for example,
      /etc/keepalived.data was a symbolic link to
      /home/fred/keepalived.data. If this was the case, instead
      create a symbolic link from /home/fred/keepalived.data to
      /tmp/keepalived.data, so that the file is still accessible
      via /home/fred/keepalived.data.  There doesn't appear to be a
      way around this backward incompatibility, since even checking
      if the pathname is a symbolic link prior to opening for
        writing would create a race condition.
  - Make netlink error messages more meaningful.
  - Fix compiling without support for macvlans.
  - fix uninitialized structure.  The linkinfo and linkattr
    structures were not initialized, so we should not expect that
    unexistant attributes are set to NULL. Add the missing
    memset().
  - fix socket allocation with dynamic interfaces.  When there are
    several vrrp instance binding different interfaces that don't
    exist at startup, their ifindex is set to 0 in the sock. The
    function already_exist_sock() that lookup for an existing
    socket will always return the first sock because the ifindex is
    the same.  Later, when an interface appears, the fd will be
    created for one instance, and all instances will wrongly use
    this fd to send the advertisments.  Fix this by using the
    interface structure pointer instead of the ifindex as the key
    for sock lookup.  The problem was identified by Olivier Matz
      who also provided a patch fixing the problem. This patch is a
      slight rework of Olivier's patch, better using the existing
      data structures that keepalived already holds.
  - When creating a macvlan interface, use AF_UNSPEC rather than
    AF_INET.
  - Stop using libnl for configuring interfaces.  Since there is
    code to configure the interfaces using netlink without using
    libnl, there is no point in having code to do it using libnl.
  - Fix building on Centos 6.5.
  - Stop including some files not needed after libnl removal for
    i/fs.
  - Fix some compilation issues when building without vrrp support.
  - Stop using linbl for mcast group membership and setting rx buf
    sizes.  Since there is code to handle multicast group
    membership and setting kernel netlink receive buffer sizes
    without using libnl, there is no point in having code to do it
    using libnl.  This now means that the vrrp functionality no
    longer uses libnl.
  - Add some sanity checking of configure options.  Certain invalid
    combinations of configure options could cause compile errors,
    e.g. --disable-vrrp --enable-vrrp-fd-debug. This commit ensures
    that invalid combinations aren't allowed, in order to stop the
    compile errors.
  - Fix invalid configuration combination caught by previous
    commit.
  - Use netlink to set/clear rp_filter on interfaces.
  - Fix configure for building without vrrp.
  - Actually update the .travis.yml file to fix the problem.
  - Fix conditional compilation re epoll-thread-dump debugging.
  - Update INSTALL file now no longer use libnl-route-3.
  - Stop cast to incompatible function type warnings from gcc 8.1.
  - Update snapcraft.yaml not to include libnl-route-3.
  - keepalived exit with non-zero exit code if config file not
    readable.
  - Allow specifying default config file at configure time.
  - Use keepalived define for exit code when malloc failure.
  - Fix configuring fixed interface type.
  - Add configuring keepalived default configuration file.
  - Fix return value in get_time_rtt() error path.
  - Update generation of git-commit.h.
  - snapcraft.yaml: Enable all sensible build options. Preserve
    build time version in the snap version. Expose genhash.
  - snapcraft.yaml: Build keepalived with Linux 3.13 headers.
  - snap: Add an install hook to make sure a keepalived
    configuration exists.
  - snap: Move the hooks to the correct location.
  - snap: Make sure /etc/keepalived exists.
  - Fix building with IP_MULTICAST_ALL in linux/in.h but not
    netinet/in.h Issue #1054 identified that configure was checking
    the definition of IP_MULTICAST_ALL in linux/in.h but including
    netinet/in.h, which also has the definition, but only from

Thu Nov  8 12:44:47 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.0.8
  - Improve identifing interface as macvlan when reading interface
    details
  - Enslave a VMAC to the VRF master of the underlying interface.
  - Use addattr32 rather than addattr_l for if_index.
  - Only include VRF support if kernel headers support it.
  - Fix --enable-timer-debug configure option.
  - Fix some configure.ac enable option tests.
  - Include stdbool.h in process.c.
  - Fix diagnostic message re ignoring weight of tracked interface.
  - Fix track_bfds with weights.
  - Correct conditional compilation definition name.
  - Fix memory leak in HTTP_GET/SSL_GET.
  - Fix two memory leaks in DNS_CHECK.
  - Don't consider retries for BFD_CHECK. The BFD_CHECKer doesn't
    support retries, and the check was causing the checker not to
    transition to down state.
  - Fix memory leak with BFD_CHECK.
  - Restart global notify FIFO handler after reload.
  - modify @WITH_REGEX@ to @WITH_REGEX_TRUE@
  - Fix compiling without BFD support.
  - Stop bfd process sending double the number of packets.  If a
    bfd process received an initial bfd packet, it scheduled a
    second bfd_sender_thread thereby causing two packets to be sent
    in every interval.
  - Use timerfd for select timeouts rather than select timeout
    parameter This is a precursor to moving to using epoll.
  - Use epoll rather than select.  epoll is both more efficient
    than select and also doesn't have a file descriptor limit of
    1024, which limited the number of vrrp instances that could be
    managed.  This commit also introduces read-black trees and the
    list_head list type.
  - Add --enable-timer-check option for logging calls for getting
    time Calls to update the current time from the kernel are made
    too frequently, and this patch logs when the calls are made,
    and how long since the previous call, so unnecessary calls can
    be removed.
  - Add debug option for monitoring epoll queues.  This is enabled
    by --enable-epoll-debug and replaces --enable-timer-debug.
  - Use system monotonic clock to generate a monotonic clock.
    Rather than have our own code for creating a monotonic clock,
    use the kernel's monotonic clock.
  - Make some functions in timer.c inline.  The functions had one
    line of code so inlining them is more efficient.
  - Fix requeueing read and write threads after read/write
    timeouts.
  - Fix initial allocating and final freeing of thread_master
    epoll_events.
  - When cleaning up threads, also clean up their thread_events.
  - Add thread_close_fd() function to release thread_event_t on
    close When a file descriptor that has been monitored by epoll
    is closed the thread_event_t structure used for managing epoll
    for that fd has to be release. Therefore calls to close() and
      replace by calls to thread_close_fd().
  - Make parent process write log entry when it is reloading.
  - Move checking for thread timeouts to timerfd_handler There is
    no point in checking for thread timeouts if the timerfd isn't
    readable; in other words only check for thread timeouts if the
    timer has expired.
  - Make bfd reschuling timer threads more efficient.
  - Streamline DNS_CHECK code.
  - Fix buffer overrun with track file path names.
  - Add timestamp when writing mem_check entries to file.
  - Ensure thread_event_t released for ready threads at
    termination.
  - Increase open file limit if large number of VRRP instances.
    Each VRRP instance can use up to 2 file descriptors, and so if
    there are more than 500 ish VRRP instances the number of open
    files can exceed the default per process limit (1024 on my
    system).  The commit allows 2 file descriptors per vrrp
    instance plus a few more, and if the RLIMIT_NOFILE value
    returned by getrlimit isn't high enough, keepalived will
    increase the limit.
  - Ensure that child processes run with standard
    priorities/limits.  When child processes such as notify
    scripts, track_scripts and MISC_CHECK scripts are run, they
    should not inherit any elevated priorities, system limits etc
    from the parent keepalived process.
  - Change multiple spaces to tabs in scheduler.h.
  - Add family to sockpool listing.
  - Fix a multiline definition expansion issue.
  - Free allocated cache when closing/freeing netlink socket.  When
    running on a system with 500+ interfaces configured and adding
    1000 VMAC interfaces, the heap was growing by 340Mb due the
    netlink cahce not being freed after creating each VMAC
    interface. With this patch the heap only grow by 3.7Mb (if
    creating 1000 VMAC interfaces the heap grep by 905Mb now
    reduced to 6.1Mb).
  - Stop using netlink cache when adding and configuring VMAC
    interfaces.  When running on a system with 500+ interfaces
    configured and adding 1000 VMAC interfaces, it was taking 2.3
    seconds to add the interfaces.  Without populating a netlink
    cache each time a VMAC interface is created it now takes 0.38
    seconds to add the interfaces (if creating 1000 VMAC interfaces
    it was taking 6.1 seconds, now reduced to 0.89 seconds, and the
    heap growth is reduced from 6.1Mb to 3.9Mb).
  - Add function rtnk_link_get_kernel for dynamic linking.
  - Fix compiling without JSON support.
  - Add support for recording perf profiling data for vrrp process.
  - Add comment re usage of MAX_ALLOC_LIST.
  - Some streamlining of scheduler.c.
  - Merge --enable-epoll-debug and --enable-dump-threads
    functionality.
  - Let thread_add_unuse() set thread type, and use
    thread_add_unuse() more.
  - Use break rather than return in process_threads().
  - Fix segfault when reloading with HTTP_GET and no regex
    configured.
  - Merge the next-generation scheduler.
  - Make all debug options need enabling at runtime.  Previously if
    configure enabled a debug option its output was always
    recorded, which meant that if one didn't want the output,
    configure/ compile was needed. This commit adds command line
    options that need to be set in order to turn the debugging on.
  - Remove unwanted debug message.
  - Fix parsing --debug options.
  - Fix rb tree insertion with timers.
  - Add missing functions for thread debugging.
  - Add vrrp instance VMAC flags when dumping configuration.
  - Ensure parent thread terminates if child has permanant config
    error.
  - Ensure don't delete VMAC interface if keepalived didn't create
    it.  and sundry fixes.
  - If receive lower priority advert, send GARP messages for sync
    group.  A recent update to issue #542 identified that following
    recovery from a split brain situation, GARP messages weren't
    being sent. It transpired that, if a member of a sync group in
    master state received a lower priority advert and
    vrrp_higher_prio_send_advert is set, a further (lower priority)
    advert is sent, and the instance and all the members of the
    sync group transition to backup (the other members of the sync
    group don't send a further advert since they haven't received a
    higher priority advert). This meant that the other members of
    the sync group on the keepalived instance that remained master
    didn't receive a lower priority advert, and so didn't send
    further GARP messages.  This commit changes keepalived's
    behaviour, so that if a vrrp instance is sending GARP messages
    due to receiving a lower priority advert and it is a member of
    a sync group, keepalived will also send GARP messages for any
    other member of the sync group that have garp_lower_prio_rep
    set.
  - Allow 0.0.0.0 and default/default6 for rule/route to/from
    addresses.
  - Check return value of SSL_CTX_new().
  - Check return values of SSL_new() and BIO_new_socket().
  - Only allow subnet masks with routes or virtual IP addresses.
    For example, if specifying a via address or preferred source
    address for a route, it isn't valid to specify a subnet mask.
  - Add inet/inet6 to specify ip route/rule family if ambiguous.
  - Remove superfluous parameter from parse_route().
  - Add "any" and "all" as synonyms for "default".
  - Fix memory leak if route destination address is wrong address
    family.
  - Add ttl-propagate route option.
  - Fix checking return status of kill().
  - Fix building with --enable-debug configure option.
  - Stop delay in reload when using network namespaces.  If running
    in a network namespace, getaddrinfo() could take over 30
    seconds before timing out while trying to contact a name
    server. To alleviate this, the hostname is remembered from when
    keepalived started.
  - Fix spelling of propagate in propagate_signal().
  - Fix effective_priority after reload if tracked interface down.
  - Cosmetic grammatical changes.
  - Add debug option for dumping vrrp fd lists.
  - Fix calculation for vrrp fd timers.  Starting or reloading
    keepalived when an interface that was tracked interface was
    failed was stopping other vrrp instances that were on the same
    interface but not using VMACs coming up.
  - Move code for initialising tracking priorities to vrrp_track.c.
  - Don't overwrite track file on reload.
  - Don't attempt to write track file if path not specified.
  - Fix compiling when not using --enable-vrrp-fd-debug.
  - Fix compiling with configure --enable-vrrp-fd-debug.
  - Add sync group track_bfds and track file status to config dump.
  - Move initialisation of track_files.
  - Don't alter effective_priority if track_file take vrrp instance
    down.
  - Don't log vrrp instance in fault state at reload if already
    fault.
  - Fix calculating fd timer if all vrrp sands are set to
    TIMER_DISABLED.
  - Don't make all sync groups transition to backup on reload If a
    sync group was in master state, and can still be after a reload
    then allow it to stay in master state.
  - Don't have track_bfd list in vrrp_sgroup_t in BFD not enabled.
  - Fix memory leak re vrrp_sgroup_t track lists.
  - Tidy up some freeing of MALLOC'd memory.  Use FREE_PTR if it is
    not known if the pointer is valid, and don't clear the pointer
    afterr FREE/FREE_PTR since FREE does it anyway.
  - Add memory.c list size definition and move definition from
    memory.h.
  - Increase size of checksum value for MEM_CHECK.
  - Don't store checksum of memory allocation block. It can be
    calculated from the size, so do so.
  - Make the checksum for memory allocation blocks unsigned.
  - Use an enum for memory allocation block types.
  - Update comment re debug bit for memory detect error.
  - In memory alloc debug code report free or realloc for not
    alloc'd.
  - Allow for PIDs up to 2^22 (7 decimal digits).
  - Add function for dumping memory allocation while running.
  - Fix max memory allocation size calculations.
  - Fix reporting original and new file/line/func for realloc.
  - Check matching block for realloc is allocated.  The same memory
    block may have been previously allocated and freed, so we need
    to make sure that the block we find is currently marked as
    allocated.
  - Use a new MEMCHECK struct for realloc overrun detected It was
    marking the allocated block as an overrun block, whereas it
    needs to be an allocated block, so use a new block to mark the
    overrun.
  - Tidy up working of a couple of memory allocation messages.
  - Use for loops rather than while blocks in memory allocation
    code.
  - Report number of mallocs and reallocs with MEMCHECK.
  - Attempt to log first free after double free in MEMCHECK.
  - Streamline use of buf/buffer in memory.c.
  - Always use first free entry in alloc_list for MEMCHECK.
  - Define MEMCHECK alloc_list size via configure.
  - Align keepalived_free() and keepalived_realloc().
  - Make char * const where possible for MEMCHECK.
  - Merge MEMCHECK keepalived_free() and keepalived_realloc().
    Most of the code was common between the two (or should have
    been), so it makes sense for them to use common code.
  - Ensure only relevant thread types run during shutdown.
  - Fix building without --enable-mem-check.
  - Use rbtree search for finding child thread on child
    termination.  It was doing a linear search of the rbtree in
    timeout order. This commit adds another rbtree for child
    processes (vrrp track scripts and check_misc scripts), sorted
    by PID, to make the search by PID more efficient.
  - Make rbtree compare function thread_timer_cmp() more efficient.
  - Remove child_remover functionality - it was superfluous.
  - Fix checking that there are no duplicate vrrp instances
    configured The tuple {interface, family, vrid} must be unique.
    The check for this was being made completely incorrectly.
  - Delay creating vrrp notify FIFO.
  - Remove struct sockaddr_storage saddr from sock_t.
  - Use an rbtree for finding vrrp instance for received advert.
    Previously the code search a list of pointers to vrrp instances
    and looked for a matching fd and vrid. In order to optimise
    this, it was implemented using an mlist whose index was a hash
    of the fd and vrid.  This commit changes the approach and uses
    an rbtree for each sock_t.  Since the sock_t that the advert
    was received on is known, the rbtree search is only searching
    for a match on the vrid.  Not only is this more efficient, but
      it is simpler, uses standard code, and reduces the code by
      over 60 lines.
  - Use an rbtree for finding vrrp instance for socket timeout.
    Previously the code search a list of pointers to vrrp instances
    and looked for matching file descriptor and sands < time_now.
    In order to optimise this, it was implemented using an mlist
    whose index was a hash of the fd.  This commit changes the
    approach and uses a second rbtree for each sock_t.  Since the
    sock_t that the timeout occurred on is known, the rbtree search
    is only searching for a match of the sands.  Not only is this
    more efficient, but it is simpler, uses standard code, and
    reduces the code by over 220 lines.
  - Remove superfluous checks of rbtree node != NULL in rb_move().
  - Remove superfluous check of node != NULL in rb_next().
  - Update rbtree code to Linux 4.18.10.
  - Fix debug logging of sands timers before time_now.
  - Update rb_for_each_entry etc and rb_move to use rb_entry_safe.
    With the added definition of rb_entry_safe in the rbtree code
    updated to Linux 4.18.10, the refinition of rb_entry was
    reverted to the kernel definition. That meant that
    rb_for_each_entry, rb_for_eacn_entry_safe and rb_move neded to
    be updated to use rb_entry_safe rather than rb_entry.
  - Add support functions for rbtree rb_root_cached.  This is in
    preparation for the use of rb_root_cached in the next patch.
  - Use cached rbtrees where the key is a timeval_t sands When the
    key of an rbtree is a timeval_t sands keepalived will
    frequently need to access the first node of the tree in order
    to calculate the next timeout. This applies to the read, write,
    child and timer threads queues, and also the vrrp queues on a
    sock_t.  The use of cached rbtrees for these is ideal since it
    gives direct access to the first node of the queue.
  - Add thread_add_read_sands to avoid introducing timer errors.
    When using thread_add_read and the timeout was held as
    timeval_t, it was converted to and offset from time_now, and
    then converted back to a timeval_t, but time_now was updated,
    resulting in a slightly different value being used as the
    timeout. Using thread_add_read_sands() avoids the double
    conversion and results in the timeout being more accurate.
  - Replace NETLINK_TIMER with TIMER_NEVER.  It makes the code
    easier to read, and since NETLINK_TIMER was defined to be
    TIMER_NEVER it doesn't change the functionality.
  - Handle preempt delays not expiring at same time on sync group
    If different vrrp instances in a sync group had preempt delays
    that expired at different times keepalived looped with very
    small to epoll_wait() until all preempt delays had expired,
    causing high CPU utilisation.  Keepalived now reschedules vrrp
    instances with a delay of 3 * advert_int + skew time while
    waiting for all vrrp instances in the sync group to expire
    their preempt delays.
  - Fix segfault when receive netlink message for default route
    added.
  - Move vrf_master_index into conditional compilation block.
  - Store interface macvlan type.
  - Make vrp_master_ifp point to self for VRF master interfaces.
  - Log if cannot create a VMAC due to existing interface with same
    name.
  - Handle delete/create of macvlan i/fs which aren't keepalived's.
  - Tidying up keepalived_netlink.c.
  - Handle VRFs changing on macvlan i/fs which have VMACs
    configured on them.
  - Fix recreating our VMACs if they are deleted.
  - Fix detecting address add/deletion from underlying i/f of our
    vmacs.
  - Don't use configured_ifp or base_ifp if not _HAVE_VRRP_VMAC_.
  - Distinguish between VMAC on real i/f and no VMAC on macvlan i/f
    If keepalived is configured to have a non VMAC interface on a
    macvlan interface, we want to use the macvlan interface rather
    than the underlying interface, whereas if we have a VMAC
    interface on a macvlan interface, we create the VMAC on the
    underlying interface of the macvlan.
  - Update duplicate VRID check where vrrp instance configured on
    macvlan.  If a VRRP instance is configured on a macvlan
    interface, the duplicate VRID check needs to be done on the
    underlying interface.
  - Check for VRID conflicts when changeable interfaces are added
    For example, a vrrp instance could be configured on a macvlan,
    and that macvlan could be deleted and recreated with another
    base interface.  The VRIDs in this case need to be checked for
    duplicates against the base interface, and so the VRID check
    needs to be done dynamically.  In order to allow VRID conflicts
    to produce config errors at startup, by default keepalived
    assumes that there won't be interface movements as described
    above, and will only handle it if the global_defs option
    'dynamic_interfaces' is used along with the option
    'allow_if_changes'.
  - Remove some comments inserted for tracking changes to code.
  - Fix building with --enable-debug configure option.
  - Check that '{'s and '}'s are balanced in the configuration
    file.
  - Allow more flexibility re placing of { and }.
  - Improve reporting additional '}'s in configuration.
  - Minor improvements re thread handling and cancellation.
  - Remove unused THREAD_IF_UP and THREAD_IF_DOWN.
  - Replace getpagesize() with sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).
  - Increase netlink receive buffer for dumps to 16KiB.
  - Dynamically set the netlink receive buffer size.
  - Sort out setting netlink receive buffer size.
- added patches for changes found during the review of the dbus

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 14:52:29 UTC 2018 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.4.1:
    * Improve and fix use of getopt_long().
      We musn't use a long option val of 1, since getopt_long() can return
      that value.
      getopt_long() also returns longindex == 0 when there is no matching
      long option, and there needs to be careful checking if there is an
      error to work out whether a long or short option was used, which is
      needed for meaningful error messages.
    * Write assert() messages to syslog.
      assert()s are nasty things, but at least let's get the benefit of
      them, and write the messages to syslog, rather than losing them down
      stderr.
    * Enable sorry server at startup if quorum down due to alpha mode
      If alpha mode is configured on sufficient checkers so that a
      virtual server doesn't have a quorum, we need to add the sorry
      server at startup, otherwise it won't be added until a quorum has
      been achieved and subsequently lost again. In the case where some
      of the checkers remain in the down state at startup, this would have
      meant that the sorry server never got added.
    * For virtual servers, ensure quorum <= number of real servers
      If the quorum were gigher than the number of real servers, the
      quorum for the real server to come up could never be achieved, so
      if the quorum is greater than the number of real servers, reduce it
      to the number of real servers.
    * Fix some SNMP keepalived checker integer types and default values.
      Some virtual server and real server values were being sent to SNMP
      with a signed type whereas the value is unsigned, so set the type
      field correctly.
      Some virtual server and real server values that apply to checkers
      are set to nonsense default values in order to determine if a
      value has been specified. Handle these values when reporting them
      to SNMP replying with 0 rather than a nonsense value.
    * Fix some MALLOC/FREE issues with notify FIFOs.
    *  Add instance_name/config_id to alert emails' subjects if configured.
      If multiple instances of keepalived are running, either different
      instance_names and/or config_ids, it is useful to know which
      keepalived instance the email relates to.
    * Ensure that email body string isn't unterminated.
      Using strncpy() needs to ensure that there is a nul termination byte,
      so this commits adds always writing a nul byte to the end of the buffer.
    * Remove duplicate fault notification.
    * Fix problem with scripts found via PATH with a '/' in parameters.
      Recent discussions on issue #101 led to discovering that if an
      executable without a fully qualified name was specified as a script
      and there was a '/' character in the parameters, then the path
      resolution would not work.
    * Send SNMP traps when go from backup to fault due to sync group.
      Commit 020a9ab added executing notify_fault for vrrp instances
      transitioning from backup to fault state due to another instance
      in the sync group going to fault state. This commit adds sending
      SNMP traps in the same circumstance.
    * Revert "Add instance_name/config_id to alert emails' subjects if
      configured". This should be handled by setting router_id
    * Add config option to send smtp-alerts to file rather than send emails
      This is useful for debugging purposes.
    * Add additional entry to Travis-CI build matrix.
    * Fix segfault if no sorry server configured for a virtual server.

Fri Jan 12 08:53:51 UTC 2018 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.4.0
  * Add Linux build and runtime versions to -v output.
  * Log kernel version and build kernel version to log at startup.
  * Don't sleep for 1 send when exiting vrrp process if no vrrp instances.
  * With large configurations the syslog can get flooded and drop output.
    This commit adds options to not log to syslog, and also to log all
    output to files.
  * Add option to only flush log files before forking.
  * Don't poll netlink for all interfaces each time add a VMAC.
    We can poll for the individual interface details which significantly
    reduces what we have to process.
  * Print interface details in keepalived.data output.
  * Add high performace child finder code.
    The code to find the relevant thread to execute afer a child process
    (either a vrrp track script or a misc_check healthchecker) was doing
    a linear search for the matching pid, which if there are a large number
    of child processes running could become time consuming.
    The code now will enable high performance child finding, based on using
    mlists hashed by the pid, if there are 32 or more vrrp track scripts or
    misc check healthcheckers. The size of the mlist is based on the number
    of scripts, with a limit of 256.
  * Improve high performance child termination timeout code.
  * Preserve filename in script path name resolution.
    Some executables change their behaviour depending on the name by
    which they are invoked (e.g. /usr/sbin/pidof when it is a link to
    /usr/sbin/killall5). Using realpath() changes the file name part
    if it is a symbolic link. This commit resolves all symbolic links
    to directories, but leaves the file name part unaltered. It then
    checks the security of both the path to the link and the path to
    the real file.
  * Handle scripts names that are symbolic links properly.
  * Fix some RFC SNMP issues.
  * Fix removing left-over addresses if keepalived aborts.
  * Update openssl use to stop using deprecated functions
    openssl from version 1.1 deprecated certain functions that keepalived
    was using. This commit ceases using those functions if the version
    of openssl is >= 1.1.
  * Allow sync groups with only 1 member, but issue a warning.
  * Add replaceable parameters in configuration files.
  * Add multiline configuration definitions.
  * Fix keepalived.conf(5) man page.
  * Suppress error message when removing leftover addresses at startup.
