Sun Oct 26 13:08:05 UTC 2025 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- Fix building with Boost >= 1.89
  (add 'kea-boost1_89.patch')

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 28 09:03:21 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 3.0.1
  Security Fixes:
  * Corrected an issue in kea-dhcp4 that caused the server to abort
    if a client sent a unicast request with a particular options,
    and Kea failed to find an appropriate subnet for that client.
    (CVE-2025-40779)
    [bsc#1248801]

  Changes:
  * Moved Botan crypto backend support to version 3.
  * Avoid adding the qualifying-suffix to fully qualified host
    names specified in host reservations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 29 09:44:04 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Remove `/usr/share/kea/meson-info` directory because it contains
  non reproducible files.
  [bsc#1246670]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  7 14:40:57 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Use meson install_umask to set binaries and libraries
  permissions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  1 09:28:14 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 3.0.0
  Noteworthy changes:
  * Lease caching is now enabled by default.
  * The control-socket.socket-name and control-socket.socket-type
    parameters have been removed from the CB.
  * Kea now rejects certain default passwords. If you copied your
    Kea configuration from the examples in our documentation using
    our sample password, change your password to a unique value.
  * The kea-control-agent is now deprecated. The individual Kea
    services support HTTP/HTTPS control channels, so the Control
    Agent (CA) is no longer needed. The CA is still available but
    will be removed in a future release.
  * The precedence of options specified in a template class and its
    spawned classes has been reversed. An option specified in a
    spawned class now takes precedence over the same option
    specified in the template class.
  * The only-if-required and require-client-classes were renamed to
    only-in-additional-list and evaluate-additional-classes.
  * Classes included in require-client-classes (now called
    evaluate-additional-classes) that do not have test expressions
    will now be unconditionally added to a client's list of
    matching classes; previously, they were ignored.
  * Additional classes are now evaluated in the same order as
    option-data, i.e. pools, subnets, and shared networks. In
    earlier versions, the order was reversed.
  * It is now possible to define multiple client classes when
    limiting access to networks, subnets, and pools. The parameter
    client-class (a single class name) has been replaced with
    client-classes (a list of one or more class names). The older
    syntax is still accepted but is now deprecated and will be
    removed in the future. You cannot specify both client-class and
    client-classes within the same scope.
  * Options name value pairs specified in option-data have a new
    parameter available: client-classes. This allows the
    administrator to place a guard on the option requiring
    membership in a class or classes before that particular option
    data will be added to the packet. This is intended as a
    powerful mechanism to bring back some of the functionality from
    the conditional (if) statements that were widely used in ISC
    DHCP. See Option Class-Tagging in the ARM for further
    information.
  * The build system has been switched to meson.

  Further detailed information of all changes is available at
  https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/-/wikis/Release-Notes/release-notes-3.0.0
  and
  https://kb.isc.org/docs/things-to-be-aware-of-when-upgrading-to-kea-300

- Set RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes in services to prevent deletion
  of RuntimeDirectory when one service gets stopped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 16 12:27:37 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Change After= from network.target to network-online.target and
  add Wants=network-online.target to systemd services to prevent
  starting up before ip setup is finished.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 26 15:07:13 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 2.6.3
  Security Fixes:
  * The default configuration for the Kea Control Agent (CA) has
    been updated to enable basic HTTP authentication.  Access to
    the Kea API will thus require a password.
    (CVE-2025-32801, CVE-2025-32802, CVE-2025-32803)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * `kea-dhcp4`, `kea-dhcp6`, `kea-dhcp-ddns`, and
    `kea-ctrl-agent` now only load hook libraries from the
    default installation directory. For ease of use, the path may
    be omitted.
    (CVE-2025-32801)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * The API command `config-write` will now only write to the same
    directory as the configuration file used when Kea was started
    (passed as a `-c` argument).
    (CVE-2025-32802)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * Lease files can now only be loaded from the data directory
    `/var/lib/kea`. This path may be overridden at startup by
    setting the environment variable `KEA_DHCP_DATA_DIR` to the
    desired path. If a path outside the defined data directory is
    used in `lease-database.name`, Kea returns an error and refuses
    to start or, if already running, aborts and exits. For ease of
    use in specifying a custom file name, simply omit the path
    component from `name`.
    (CVE-2025-32802)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * Log files can now only be written to a defined output directory
    `/var/log/kea`. This path may be overridden at startup by
    setting the environment variable `KEA_LOG_FILE_DIR` to the
    desired path. If a path outside the defined output directory is
    used in `loggers.output_options.output`, Kea returns an error
    and refuses to start or, if already running, aborts and exits.
    For ease of use, simply omit the path component from `output`
    and specify only the file name.
    (CVE-2025-32802)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * Files created by Kea now have more restrictive file
    permissions. Write access by group and any access by others is
    now forbidden.
    (CVE-2025-32803)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * Sockets can no longer be created in a world-writable directory,
    such as `/tmp`. Sockets must now be created in the more
    restricted `/var/run/kea`.
    (CVE-2025-32802)
    [bsc#1243240]
  * Many sample configuration files have been updated to reflect
    changes introduced in this release. In the ARM, the Kea
    Security section has been moved to a more prominent location,
    and a new section concerning securing the Kea Control Agent has
    been added.
    (CVE-2025-32801, CVE-2025-32802, CVE-2025-32803)
    [bsc#1243240]

  Other changes:
  * Fix build with the latest Boost 1.87.
    (Obsoletes patch `kea-2.6.1-boost_1.87-compat.patch`)
  * Backported a clarification in the ARM about subnet4-delta-add.

- Remove /run/kea from systemd tmpfiles as the creation of this
  directory is handled by the services.
- Replace 'chmod -h' and 'chown -h' with 'find' as the '-h' isn't
  present in Leap/SLE.
- /run/kea now has mode 0750 for all services.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 30 13:21:39 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update owner and perms in %post on modified config files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 15 11:01:25 UTC 2025 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Add logic to %post for switching from kea.service to the new
  split units, kea-*.service.
  (Inspiration taken from strongswan.spec.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 15:29:59 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Split off services into separate ones to allow more fine grained
  control for e.g. capabilities.
- Tighten access to state and log directories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 26 16:01:54 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 2.6.2
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix for inaccurate statistics: Kea was miscalculating
    declined and assigned leases.
  * Fix for lease conflicts and NAK: Conflicting entries were
    created when two relayed HA instances tried to update a shared
    lease DB at the same time.
  * Fix for `subnetX-del` not removing subnets completely:
    `subnetX-del` was not correctly deleting the subnet declaration
    from the shared network configuration section.
  * Fix for `config-write` and `retry-on-startup` parameter:
    `config-write` was improperly storing the `retry-on-startup`
    parameter in the config file, causing Kea to fail when
    restarting.
  * Fix for incorrect DB schema entry: A typo prevented the
    upgrade script from working in certain circumstances.
  * Fix for mishandling malformed DISCOVER packets:
  * Fix for excessive memory utilization when receiving frequent
    SIGHUP: Kea was storing a history of configs in memory with
    each restart.
  * Fix for `config-set` with `output_options`: `config-set` was
    omitting the `output_options` section when spelled with "_".
  * Fix for store-extended-info breaking lease limits: A specific
    combination of vendor classes and storing extended info caused
    limits to not be applied.
  * Fix for DB connection recovery
  * DB upgrade scripts: DB upgrade could fail on some
    distributions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 13 13:26:28 UTC 2025 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Add patch to fix build with boost 1.87
  (kea-2.6.1-boost_1.87-compat.patch)
- Add BuildRequires for python3-sphinx_rtd_theme to fix docs build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  8 11:47:33 UTC 2024 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Update to release 2.6.1
  Bug fixes:
  * Corrected an issue in MySQL config back end that causes
    preferred life time values to be overwritten when updating
    client classes via remote-set-class6. command.
  * Corrected an issue with overlapping enum values for option
    definition data type.  This was causing option definitions of
    type "record", created via config backend commands, to not load
    properly when fetched from the back end.
  * Corrected a bug in storing and fetching the encapsulated DHCP
    options from the configuration backend. These options were
    sometimes not returned when they were specified at the subnet,
    shared network or client class level.
  * Fixed a file descriptor leak in the High Availability hook
    library.

- Only require bison for build and enable regen_files on Tumbleweed
  and SLFO, because bison is too old in SLES/Leap
- Remove leading zeros from %if %{with ...}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 09:37:04 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.6.0
  * New features:
  * Hub-and-spoke model in High Availability (HA)
  * Ping Check hook, RADIUS hook, Performance Monitoring hook
  * Database connection retry on startup
  * Classless static route option
  * Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) options
  * Stash Agent options: ISC DHCP provided a
    `stash-agent-options` mechanism that, when enabled, caused
    the server to remember options inserted by a relay agent
    during the initial exchange with a client.
  * Removals/Changes:
  * Removed autogeneration of subnet-ids
  * `output_options` was renamed to `output-options`

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * fix a race condition in FLQ in which kea could crash
  * fix a regression where redetection of interfaces stopped working

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  6 13:57:08 UTC 2023 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Add RuntimeDirectory to kea.service
- Update to release 2.4.0
  Breaking Changes:
  * Both MySQL and PostgreSQL database schemas were updated to
    accommodate DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery support.
  * The values accepted by `operation-target` used in
    `reservation-*` commands have been renamed: primary ->
    memory, alternate -> database.
  * Kea DHCPv4 server can now handle multiple `vivco-suboptions`
    options with different enterprise IDs and multiple vendor
    options.
  * The Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) options
    have been implemented for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. The options
    allow configuration.
  * Template classes mechanism, similar to spawning classes in
    ISC DHCP, has been implemented.
  * Kea now keeps leases for a period of time after they are
    released.
  * An address reserved in a global reservation must now lie
    within the range of the subnet or shared-network selected by
    Kea.
  * It is now possible to add an "empty" host reservation without
    any attribute.
  * kea-dhcp4 now supports the `offer-lifetime` parameter to
    allow the temporary allocation of leases during DHCPOFFER.
  * Added support for Secure Zero Touch Provisioning options, per
    RFC8572.
  * The kea-dhcp6 `prefix-len` and `pd-pools` list now checks the
    prefix lengths correctly.
  * The preferred lifetime is now calculated as 0.625 *
    `valid-lifetime` unless explicitly specified.
  * The link selection suboption is now optional.
  * See /usr/share/doc/kea/ChangeLog in the kea-doc package for
    details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 14 14:51:33 UTC 2022 - Jorik Cronenberg <jorik.cronenberg@suse.com>

- Separate documentation into kea-doc package
- Remove following packages from BuildRequires
  * docbook-xsl-stylesheets
  * elinks
  * libxslt-tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 18 12:53:21 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.2.0
  * Kea now features full native support for TLS in HA
  * PostgreSQL configuration backend
  * A new hook is dedicated to RBAC.
  * A new hook limits the rate and number of leases.
  * A new DDNS Tuning library adds custom behaviors related to
    Dynamic DNS updates on a per-client basis.
  * The subnet_cmds hook has been expanded with several new
    commands: `subnet4-delta-add`, `subnet4-delta-del`,
    `subnet6-delta-add`, and `subnet6-delta-del`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 23:33:08 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.0.0
  * In Kea 2.0, the HA component has undergone a substantial
    architectural change. When HA+MT is enabled, the DHCPv4 and
    DHCPv6 daemons are now able to open HTTP sockets on their own
    and connect directly to each other, bypassing the Control Agent
    (CA). This eliminates the bottlenecks of sequential UNIX socket
    connection and the need to translate between HTTP and UNIX
    socket connections.
  * A new parameter on-fail gives the operator more control over
    what to do on database connection loss.
  * The length of the "parking lot queue" is now configurable; a
    default value of 256 is used.
  * A new statistic, `packet-queue-size`, has been added that
    reports packet-queue utilization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 23:21:35 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.8
  * Kea now recognizes requests sent from vendors that include
    their information in DHCPv6 Vendor Class option (code 16).
  * Fixed the server ignoring the Subnet Selection option
    supplied by a client if its query contained a Relay Agent
    Information (RAI) option without a Link Selection option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 15 11:09:40 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.7
  * The Control Agent now supports TLS/HTTPS.
  * kea-shell supports TLS/HTTPS.
  * kea-admin now accepts the -P, --port parameter
  * kea-dhcp4 now supports specifying valid-lifetime in
    client classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  5 10:02:22 UTC 2021 - Samu Voutilainen <smar@smar.fi>

- Own directory /var/lib/kea, as that is used as default for
  memfile lease store.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 08:04:38 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.1
  * New parameters: ddns-use-conflict-resolution,
    ip-reservations-unique, ddns-update-on-renew,
    cache-threshold, cache-max-age.
  * Support for new IPv6-only-preferred option for DHCPv4.
  * Added support of basic HTTP authentication in HTTP library,
    control agent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 22:02:39 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.8.0
  * User-defined option definitions were not committed, which was
    fixed.
  * kea-dhcp4 now rejects inbound client messages that have
    neither a hardware address nor a client identifier.
  * Rather than within the 'dhcp-ddns' section, DDNS behavioral
    parameters may now be specified at global, shared-network,
    and subnet scopes.
  * Added support of BOOTP leases with infinite valid lifetime.
  * Added the -N command line switch that enables experimental
    multi-threading support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 04:03:08 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to Python 3 Sphinx due to Python 2 removal. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 17:18:55 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.6.0
  * Corrected multiple occurrences of out of bounds vector reads.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    caused the Kea DHCPv6 server to incorrectly require the
    server tag to be provided with the remote-subnet6-option-set
    command.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    prevented the DHCP servers from discovering and fetching the
    changes applied with the new commands.
  * Prevent the DHCP servers from asserting when malformed
    hostname or FQDN options are received.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 27 14:36:52 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update keyring file
- Temporarily hardcode version in upstream URLs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 21 15:08:38 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0~beta2
  * Default file locations for lease file, server-duid, log files and lock 
    files have changed. Files previously stored in `/var/kea` are now stored 
    in `/var/run/kea`. Server hooks previously installed in `/usr/lib/hooks` 
    are now installed in `/usr/lib/kea/hooks`. The log files are now stored 
    in `/var/log/kea`.
  * The kea-admin commands (lease-init, lease-version, lease-upgrade) were 
    renamed to better reflect the fact that the database can store much more 
    than just leases. They're now called db-init, db-version, db-upgrade.
  * The Logging entry in the configuration file has moved to specific 
    daemon sections. This require a simple configuration file modification. 
    You need to move Logging entry from its global scope into the Dhcp4, 
    Dhcp6, DhcpDdns, Control-agent or Netconf scope.

Please see 1.6 migration wiki
