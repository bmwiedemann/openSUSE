Thu Aug 18 12:53:21 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.2.0
  * Kea now features full native support for TLS in HA
  * PostgreSQL configuration backend
  * A new hook is dedicated to RBAC.
  * A new hook limits the rate and number of leases.
  * A new DDNS Tuning library adds custom behaviors related to
    Dynamic DNS updates on a per-client basis.
  * The subnet_cmds hook has been expanded with several new
    commands: `subnet4-delta-add`, `subnet4-delta-del`,
    `subnet6-delta-add`, and `subnet6-delta-del`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 23:33:08 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2.0.0
  * In Kea 2.0, the HA component has undergone a substantial
    architectural change. When HA+MT is enabled, the DHCPv4 and
    DHCPv6 daemons are now able to open HTTP sockets on their own
    and connect directly to each other, bypassing the Control Agent
    (CA). This eliminates the bottlenecks of sequential UNIX socket
    connection and the need to translate between HTTP and UNIX
    socket connections.
  * A new parameter on-fail gives the operator more control over
    what to do on database connection loss.
  * The length of the "parking lot queue" is now configurable; a
    default value of 256 is used.
  * A new statistic, `packet-queue-size`, has been added that
    reports packet-queue utilization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 23:21:35 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.8
  * Kea now recognizes requests sent from vendors that include
    their information in DHCPv6 Vendor Class option (code 16).
  * Fixed the server ignoring the Subnet Selection option
    supplied by a client if its query contained a Relay Agent
    Information (RAI) option without a Link Selection option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 15 11:09:40 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.7
  * The Control Agent now supports TLS/HTTPS.
  * kea-shell supports TLS/HTTPS.
  * kea-admin now accepts the -P, --port parameter
  * kea-dhcp4 now supports specifying valid-lifetime in
    client classes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  5 10:02:22 UTC 2021 - Samu Voutilainen <smar@smar.fi>

- Own directory /var/lib/kea, as that is used as default for
  memfile lease store.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 08:04:38 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.1
  * New parameters: ddns-use-conflict-resolution,
    ip-reservations-unique, ddns-update-on-renew,
    cache-threshold, cache-max-age.
  * Support for new IPv6-only-preferred option for DHCPv4.
  * Added support of basic HTTP authentication in HTTP library,
    control agent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 22:02:39 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.8.0
  * User-defined option definitions were not committed, which was
    fixed.
  * kea-dhcp4 now rejects inbound client messages that have
    neither a hardware address nor a client identifier.
  * Rather than within the 'dhcp-ddns' section, DDNS behavioral
    parameters may now be specified at global, shared-network,
    and subnet scopes.
  * Added support of BOOTP leases with infinite valid lifetime.
  * Added the -N command line switch that enables experimental
    multi-threading support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 04:03:08 UTC 2020 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Switch to Python 3 Sphinx due to Python 2 removal. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 17:18:55 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.6.0
  * Corrected multiple occurrences of out of bounds vector reads.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    caused the Kea DHCPv6 server to incorrectly require the
    server tag to be provided with the remote-subnet6-option-set
    command.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    prevented the DHCP servers from discovering and fetching the
    changes applied with the new commands.
  * Prevent the DHCP servers from asserting when malformed
    hostname or FQDN options are received.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 27 14:36:52 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update keyring file
- Temporarily hardcode version in upstream URLs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 21 15:08:38 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0~beta2
  * Default file locations for lease file, server-duid, log files and lock 
    files have changed. Files previously stored in `/var/kea` are now stored 
    in `/var/run/kea`. Server hooks previously installed in `/usr/lib/hooks` 
    are now installed in `/usr/lib/kea/hooks`. The log files are now stored 
    in `/var/log/kea`.
  * The kea-admin commands (lease-init, lease-version, lease-upgrade) were 
    renamed to better reflect the fact that the database can store much more 
    than just leases. They're now called db-init, db-version, db-upgrade.
  * The Logging entry in the configuration file has moved to specific 
    daemon sections. This require a simple configuration file modification. 
    You need to move Logging entry from its global scope into the Dhcp4, 
    Dhcp6, DhcpDdns, Control-agent or Netconf scope.
