- Update to release 1.6.0
  * Corrected multiple occurrences of out of bounds vector reads.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    caused the Kea DHCPv6 server to incorrectly require the
    server tag to be provided with the remote-subnet6-option-set
    command.
  * Corrected a bug in the Kea MySQL Configuration Backend which
    prevented the DHCP servers from discovering and fetching the
    changes applied with the new commands.
  * Prevent the DHCP servers from asserting when malformed
    hostname or FQDN options are received.

Wed Aug 21 15:08:38 UTC 2019 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0~beta2
  * Default file locations for lease file, server-duid, log files and lock 
    files have changed. Files previously stored in `/var/kea` are now stored 
    in `/var/run/kea`. Server hooks previously installed in `/usr/lib/hooks` 
    are now installed in `/usr/lib/kea/hooks`. The log files are now stored 
    in `/var/log/kea`.
  * The kea-admin commands (lease-init, lease-version, lease-upgrade) were 
    renamed to better reflect the fact that the database can store much more 
    than just leases. They're now called db-init, db-version, db-upgrade.
  * The Logging entry in the configuration file has moved to specific 
    daemon sections. This require a simple configuration file modification. 
    You need to move Logging entry from its global scope into the Dhcp4, 
    Dhcp6, DhcpDdns, Control-agent or Netconf scope.
