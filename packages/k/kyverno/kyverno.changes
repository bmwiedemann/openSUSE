Thu Nov 16 15:02:05 UTC 2023 - kastl@b1-systems.de

- Update to version 1.11.0:
  * Breaking (Potentially) ❗
    - Policy Reports are now created on a per-resource basis and
      using a UID as the name rather than the previous behavior of
      per-policy. This may be a breaking change if you relied upon
      either of these attributes in previous versions. This change
      has the benefit of putting less pressure on the Kubernetes
      API server and less storage cost on etcd.
    - In accordance with Cosign 2.0 updates, the Rekor URL is now
      required in a policy. The url field may be empty ("") but
      must be specified even if you've opted not to store
      signatures in a Rekor instance. Users upgrading from Kyverno
      v1.10 to v1.11 who have image verification policies using
      cosign will have to explicitly disable Tlogs and SCT
      verification in their policy using the rekor.ignoreTlogs and
      ctlog.IgnoreSCT fields if they did not use Rekor while
      signing the image.
  * Added
    - Context variables are now supported in cleanup policies
      (#6084)

      Kyverno CLI in both test and apply commands (#6656)

      Kyverno when a compatible validate.cel rule is created
      (#7840, #8219)
    - Generate Policy Reports for VAPs (#8135)
    - Kyverno validate rules can now be written using CEL
      expressions, including auto-gen support (#7859, #8024, #8071,
      #8084, #8098, #8099, #8196)

    - Added CLI API schema for test command (#8422, #8438, #8439,
      see also Changed below)
    - Added new create commands to the Kyverno CLI used to easily
      create the various resources needed for testing (#7778,
      #7779, #7780, #7781, #7782, #8160)
    - Added new Kyverno CLI docs command to generate CLI
      documentation (#8179, #8180, #8181, #8191, #8193, #8200,

    - New metric of type Meter is added for the TTL cleanup manager
      with attributes resource_group, resource_version, and
      resource_resource (#8134)
    - Added ability to configure TUF when using a custom Sigstore
      implementation (#8385)
    - Added ability to disable TUF when used in air-gapped
      environments (#8509)
    - Helm
      - Added API priority and fairness resources to the Kyverno
        chart (FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration) (#7468)
      - Added ability to set security contexts for the webhook

      rather than per-policy, and intermediary aggregated reports
      are expunged immediately (#8426)
    - Schema validation will no longer be done on patterns
      (including internal validation for mutate rules) obviating
      the need for spec.schemaValidation. We will deprecate and
      remove this field in a future version (#8538)
    - Cleanup policies no longer use CronJobs to invoke the cleanup
      action. This is all handled internally now (#8526, #8529,
      #8531)
    - Kyverno CLI test command has been refactored and includes a
      formal test manifest schema (#8422, #6871, #6942, #7995,
      #8145, #8163, #8168, #8177, #8189, #8212, #8387, and more)
    - Kyverno CLI apply command now has a nice tabular output
      format (#7757)
    - Kyverno CLI apply now shows failure messages when a result
      fails (#7758)
    - Kyverno CLI --compact flag has been renamed to

      hidden (#8077)
    - Refactored JSON patches to use structure instead of byte
      arrays (#7186)
    - Deprecated the --imageSignatureRepository container flag. Use
      verifyImages.Repository in a policy definition instead
      (#7391)
    - Replaced the internal package used to apply JSON patches.
      This resulted in some fixes and slight behavioral changes
      (#7401, #7452)
    - The policies.kyverno.io/last-applied-patches annotation upon
      successful mutation has been removed (#7438)
    - RBAC has been hardened for a couple controllers to better
      follow least privileges (#7626, #7634, #7638, #8083)
    - The images variable ({{ images }}) can be used correctly in a
      policy (#7787)

      multiple paths (#8247)
    - The remainder of match/excludewill be skipped if
      theoperations[]` do not match (#8324)
    - Helm
      - The Grafana dashboard has been moved to its own subchart in
        an effort to reduce the size of the main Kyverno chart
        (#8619)
      - Kyverno CRDs have been moved to a subchart for the same
        reason (#8623)
      - Updated the Chart metadata so the minimum version is
        correctly aligned with that of Kyverno itself (#8708)
  * Fixed
    - Abort pattern validation earlier when processing can occur
      (#7307)
    - Fixed an issue when testing for mutations using foreach
      (#7396)
    - Fixed not validating that subject kinds were on the allowed
      list (#7582)
    - Fixed a panic when certain environment variables weren't
      passed to the controllers (#7613)

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  Kyverno 1.10 is a huge release which brings breaking changes in
  both the application and Helm chart. Please read these release
  notes carefully!
  * Major features:
    - Split the main Kyverno Deployment into 3 separate
      controllers/Deployments
    - Intra-cluster Service calls
    - Notary v2 support
    - Major reworking of generate and "mutate existing" policies
  * Breaking changes
    - This release separates Kyverno into its 3 main components:
      admission controller, reporting controller, and background
      controller. As a result, there is no direct upgrade path from
      previous versions. When deploying with Helm, we recommend
      either backing up and restoring Kyverno policies (kubectl get
      pol,cpol,cleanpol,ccleanpol,polex -A > backup.yaml) or
      scaling the Kyverno deployment(s) to zero first. Policy
      reports will be regenerated from existing resources when
      policies are reinstalled. Regardless of the option, this
      upgrade should be performed in a maintenance window as there
      will be downtime involved.
    - As a result of this decomposition, aggregated ClusterRoles
      may need to be updated to use the new label values depending
      on the controller which requires those permissions.
    - Policies which matched on some types of subresources (such as
      PodExecOptions) will need to be updated to use the
      standardized form of <parent>/<subresource> (Pod/exec).
    - The following fields in a generate rule are now immutable
      once created: spec.rules.name, spec.rules.match,
      spec.rules.exclude, spec.rules.preconditions,
      spec.generate.apiVersion, spec.generate.kind,
      spec.generate.namespace, spec.generate.name,
      spec.generate.clone, and spec.generate.cloneList (#6328,
      #6451)
    - Variables in these portions of a generate rule will now be
      disallowed: clone, cloneList, generate.kind, and
      generate.apiVersion (#6438)
    - Generate and "mutate existing" policies, once installed, will
      check to see if Kyverno has the necessary permissions to
      successfully execute them. If not, Kyverno will block their
      creation until the permissions are available. This is added
      to bring behavior in alignment with how cleanup policies work
      and provide a better UX (#6610)
    - Properly enforcing that "mutate existing" rules, when
      mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate is set to true, also has
      mutate.targets[] defined or else the policy creation will be
      blocked (#6693)
    - When a verifyImages policy is created in Audit mode, its
      creation will be rejected unless mutateDigest is set to false
      (#6757)
    - Mutation rules which change the image field in a Pod spec and
      which relied on docker.io being silently added by Kyverno
      (when it was not explicitly defined in the image) will need
      to be adjusted to either use the images.*.registry predefined
      variable or the new normalize_image() JMESPath filter. To
      address other discovered issues with mutation, Kyverno can no
      longer add the default registry to the context. It will only
      be accessible to internal variables and JMESPath.
    - The generate.apiVersion field is now required in a generate
      rule. Policies/rules without this defined will need to set
      it. (#7080)
