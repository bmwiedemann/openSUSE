  <title>kyverno CLI and kubectl plugin</title>
  <description>The Kyverno Command Line Interface (CLI) is designed to validate and test policy behavior to resources prior to adding them to a cluster. The CLI can be used in CI/CD pipelines to assist with the resource authoring process to ensure they conform to standards prior to them being deployed. It can be used as a kubectl plugin or as a standalone CLI.</description>
