- Update to 3.3.0
  * some improvements for Btrfs, F2FS, NTFS file systems
  * first bits of new LUKS2 on-disk format support, now KDE
    Partition Manager can display LUKS2 labels. More LUKS2 work
    will follow in KPM 3.4.
  * There were changes in how LVM devices are detected which might
    be interesting if you use Calamares installer. In that case,
    you also need at least Calamares 3.1.8. Older versions will not
    compile against KPMcore 3.3.
  * KPMcore library now only depends on just three Tier 1
    Frameworks (I18n, CoreAddons, WidgetsAddons) instead of Tier 3
    (although, we will later require Tier 2 KAuth too)
- Drop fix-build-with-older-parted.patch, it cannot be built on
  Leap 42 anymore anyway because it needs newer Qt5 and blkid

- Update to 3.2.0
  * Added support for UDF file system (this change requires
    util-linux 2.30). While adding support for UDF, the following
    general improvements were made:
    + KPM now supports setting label for file systems where it can
      only be done during initial formating (e.g. nilfs2 or udf)
    + File system label widget (QLineEdit) now validates its input
      for certain file systems (at the moment only FAT and UDF),
      not just maximum label length.
  * Detection support for ISO9660 file system
  * kpmcore now has lighter KDE Frameworks dependencies, KIO is no
    longer necessary, KIconThemes dependency moved from kpmcore to
    Partition Manager
  * kpmcore now has its own fstab parser and writer. Before we
    used to rely on glibc but it had no support for reading fstab
    comments, etc.
