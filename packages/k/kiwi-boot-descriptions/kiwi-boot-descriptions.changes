- Use %suse_version instead of %sle_version do detect SLE 15 (SP*)
  %sle_version is different depending on SP1 vs GA, but %suse_version
  is the same for all SLE 15.

- Improve partition validation for PXE
    
  This commit includes a patch to relax the partition
  size validation. It turned to happen that under some
  specific partition size configurations in the PXE client
  the partition layout was always seen as an invalid one
  in each boot. This was causing a repartition and redeploy
  of the PXE image in every single boot.
    
  Fixes bsc#1141156

- Normalize partedGetPartitionID output (bsc#1136744)
    
  This commit ensures the partedGetPartitionID output returns the
  same partition ID codes with or without the presence of sgdisk
  utility. It basically trusts partition names provided by KIWI to map
  partitions to specific IDs.
    
  Additionally this commit also makes sure that the partition stated
  to be of `ef` type in config.<mac> is named `legacy`, to be consistent
  with the partedGetPartitionID expectations.

- Deleted obsolete boot image descriptions

  The support for dracut in kiwi has settled some time ago and
  for the custom boot descriptions deleted here there is a dracut
  based replacement. See the following list and the reason for
  the deletion:

  * arm/oemboot
    Any oem image created with kiwi-ng for arm uses dracut.
    There is no tested support for oemboot on arm

  * ppc/netboot and ppc/oemboot
    Support for ppc with kiwi-ng is still being worked on.
    We will not support custom oem code when we can have
    dracut based support. This obsolete descriptions are an
    artifact of the legacy kiwi version

  * s390/oemboot
    Any oem image created with kiwi-ng for s390 uses dracut
    There is no tested support for oemboot on s390

  * x86_64/oemboot/rhel-07.0 and x86_64/oemboot/ubuntu-xenial
    Obsolete and replaced with generic dracut support in kiwi-ng

  * x86_64/oemboot/suse-leap42.2 and x86_64/oemboot/suse-leap42.3
    Distributions out of support per upstream kiwi policy

  * x86_64/oemboot/suse-tumbleweed
    Lots of changes on the udev and systemd side made oemboot
    non functional anyway. The switch to dracut is inevitable here.
    Thus no reason to keep broken oemboot code around

- Use default values for nr_inode on devtmpfs mounts
    
  Using nr_inode=0 is causing mount failures in recent kernels. This
  option was introduced to fix issues in split systems, which are no
  longer supported. According to that we just remove this option and
  let mount set the default value, which depends on available memory
  of the system. Fixes SUSE/kiwi#1105

- Fixed udev startup
  Due to a change in the udev rules an error in kiwi was triggered
  that outlines an incomplete udev startup sequence. This
  patch fixes the creation of the dev tree by udev and is

- Set SERVER variable as expected by netboot code (#674)

  The same criteria applies for $type and $SERVERTYPE variables.

- Use setctsid/bash instead of sulogin for debugging
    
  The custom kiwi boot descriptions supports a boot process
  accompanying debug shell if the kiwidebug=1 option is
  set on the kernel command line. That shell was invoked
  using sulogin. Problem is that this call occupies the
  controlling terminal and console such that the typical
  multiplexing of consoles through plymouth is stopped.
  This means it's not possible to run e.g an oem deployment
  with several active/multiplexed consoles and a backgrounding
  debuging shell. This patch moves away from sulogin and
  calls a bash through setctsid on a free console
