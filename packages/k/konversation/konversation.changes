    set via the configuration dialog to be ignored. A font size
    modification done via the Enlarge/Decrease Font Size actions
    is now applied on top of the configured size (or the system
    default font size, respectively).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 10 23:17:27 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 1.7.3:
  * Added a copy action to the context menu of nicknames in the
    chat text view.
  * Re-enabled channel mode buttons.
  * Reduced emission of Unicode directional control characters in
    the chat text view. Unnecessary control characters could
    sometimes cause problems with copying text from Konversation
    and pasting it into terminal applications, confusing them.
  * Fixed handling of nick and channel prefix characters
    potentially using the same set of symbols.
  * Removed redundant escaping of angle brackets in GECOS
    ("realname") field.
  * The nickname combobox will no longer change the nickname to
    the current value whenvever it loses focus.
  * Fixed color scheme handling in the treelist version on the tab
    bar, fixing an issue where the background and text color of
    the selected item would sometimes be the same, rendering the
    item unreadable.
  * Fixed handling of IRC URLs for channels starting with more
    than one #, addressing a percent-encoding problem with
    bookmarks of them.
  * Fixed custom chat text view font family reverting to system
    default font family upon using the increase/decrease font size
    actions.
  * Fixed chat text view font size adjusted via the
    increase/decrease font size actions reverting to configuration
    default when OK'ing the config dialog.
  * Fixed incorrect checkbox states in the Channel Invite dialog.
  * Fixed a crash in IRC v3 extended-join parsing.
  * Fixed a crash in parsing IRC color formatting codes.
    (CVE-2017-15923 boo#1068097)
  * Fixed a minor memory leak in the Join Channel dialog code.
  * Removed unnecessary nickname list debug message sent as
    warning.

- Update to 1.6:
  * Improved support for character set aliases via KCharsets.
  * Improved behavior when reconnecting and Konversation had to use
    an alternate nickname for the previous connection because the
    preferred nickname was already in use: Konversation will now
    try harder to go back to nicknames sorted earlier in the
    identity's nickname list, instead of advancing down the list
    without checking whether earlier nicknames have become
    available again.
  * Konversation will no longer give up trying to connect when only
    a single nickname is configured and not available at connection
    time. Instead, it will do as many reconnection attempts as
    allowed by user configuration.
  * Fixed incorrect size calculations for the channel topic text
    label causing cut-off text and unwanted collapsing of the topic
    area.
  * Fixed a bug causing auto-connect not to connect to networks in
    the order they are listed in the Server List dialog.
  * Fixed a bug causing the main window not to be raised when an
    Konversation is started an additional time and the window is

    version of the tab bar.
  * Tabs can now be reordered by drag and drop again.
  * Fixed various rendering issues in the treelist version of the
    tab bar and made it high-DPI scaling-capable.
  * Fixed a bug causing Channel List tabs not to be sorted below
    the status tab of the server they belong to in the treelist
    version of the tab bar, and corrupt its contents.
  * Fixed margins in the Edit Network dialog.
  * Improved wording and correctness of several interface messages.
  * Fixed a bug causing some interface messages and labels not to
    use their translated versions when running with a language
    other than US English.
  * Fixed a bug causing Konversation not to generate default
    command aliases for installed scripts at startup anymore.
  * The bundled 'cmd' script now defaults to trying to decode
    command output as Utf-8 even when run on Python 2.
  * Fixed the bundled 'bug' script not working.
  * Fixed naming of bundled icons.
  * Konversation now opts into Qt's high-DPI pixmap handling.
  * Adjusted build system to use co-installable version of qca-qt5.

    v5.3.0.
  * The default nickname list theme has been updated to KDE's new
    Breeze visual identity.
  * Notification events now have non-generic titles to prevent
    Plasma Desktop 5 from merging events from different sources.
  * Fixed a bug causing the "Focus Input Bar" action to be
    enabled/disabled at incorrect times.
- Package ported to KF5. Updated build and runtime requirements to
  the KF5 ones.
- Removed support for old openSUSE versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  4 16:38:29 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 1.5.1
 * Konversation 1.5.1 is a maintenance release containing only bug
   fixes. The included changes address several minor behavioral
   defects and a low-risk DoS security defect in the Blowfish
   ECB support. The KDE Platform version dependency has increased
   to v4.9.0 to gain access to newer Qt socket transport
   security flags.
 * Fixed a bug causing wildcards in command alias replacement
   patterns not to be expanded.
 * Fixed a bug causing auto-joining of channels not starting
   in # or & to sometimes fail because the auto-join command
   was generated before we got the CHANTYPES pronouncement
   by the server.
 * Added a size sanity check for incoming Blowfish ECB blocks.
   The blind assumption of incoming blocks being the expected
   12 bytes could lead to a crash or up to 11 byte information
   leak due to an out-of-bounds read. CVE-2014-8483.
 * Enabling SSL/TLS support for connections will now advertise
   the protocols Qt considers secure by default, instead of
   being hardcoded to TLSv1.
 * Fixed the bundled 'sysinfo' script not coping with empty
   lines in /etc/os-release.
 * Made disk space info in the bundled 'sysinfo' script more
   robust by forcing the C locale for 'df'.
 * Added an audio player type hint for Cantata to the bundled
   'media' script.
 * Fixed some minor comparison logic errors turned up by
   static analysis.
 * Konversation now depends on KDE Platform v4.9.0 or higher.

 * The bundled 'sysinfo' script now tries harder to determine the
   current CPU clock frequencies (it now looks at

 * Fixed a bug causing the flood fill tool in DCC Whiteboard tabs
   not to use the correct color after using the color picker tool
   to set it.
 * Launching the default browser when clicking on links now works
   properly again on Windows.
 * Fixed a bug causing certain combinations of sorting and
   filtering in Channel List tabs not to work correctly, leading
   to partially unsorted list entries.
 * Minor rewordings and cleanups in UI text and the handbook for
   clarity and correctness, e.g. the "Notify" notification event
   is now known as "Nick on-line".
 * More information sources are now taken into account to update
   Konversation's idea of whether a particular nick is identified
   with services or not (information from IRC numeric 330 was
   previously discarded).
 * Fixed a bug causing Konversation to attempt to PART a channel
   that's no longer actually joined when closing a channel tab
   after having been kicked from the channel.
 * Some included PNG image files were badly encoded, this has
   been addressed.
 * Fixed a bug causing the file URL for an authentication
   certificate in the Identities dialog to be forgotten across
   application restarts.
 * The warning about text in the topic editor exceeding the
   server-allowed limit now calculates the threshold more
   correctly, taking encoding and IRC formatting expandos
   into account.
 * Konversation now depends on KDE Platform v4.7.0 or higher
   and Qt v4.7.0 or higher.

- Update to 1.5-rc1
 * Performance optimizations and code cleanup for processing NAMES
   messages from the server.
 * The bundled 'media' script has been rewritten from scratch to
   implement the MPRIS2 standard for interfacing with media players -
   and only the MPRIS2 standard. This means losing support for a
   number of legacy players which do not support MPRIS2
 * The bundled 'sayclip' script has been rewritten from scratch,
   removing the now-redundant flood handling found in the old version
 * The bundled 'bug' script has been rewritten from scratch, featuring
   improved error handling and adding internationalization support.
 * The bundled 'sysinfo' script has been rewritten from scratch.
 * All types of tabs which sport a prominent input widget will now see
   focus moved to that widget and the first keypress redirected when
   focus is on the treelist version of the tab bar while starting to
   type.
 * Performance improvements have been applied to hotpaths in the
   protocol implementation.
 * A '/umode' convenience command to set modes on self has been added.
 * The 'Mode change' notification event now sports a proper text

   is enabled.
 * The behavior of the 'Show/Hide Konversation' action has been

   ("CAP") has been added.
 * The user interface for the Auto Identify settings in the Identities
   dialog has been extended by a combo box that allows choosing the
  type of authentification to be performed.
 * SASL PLAIN authentification is now supported.
 * Standard NickServ authentification has been further improved.
 * The server password-based authentification supported by some
   networks is now configurable in the Identities dialog as well,
   making it more discoverable and allowing to keep Auto Identify
   settings generally with the Identity rather than requiring going
   through the Edit Server dialog.
 * Added an option to restrict logging to private conversations
   (queries, DCC chats).
 * Both the regular tab bar and its listview version now implement
   "spring-loading".
 * Added support for authenticating via a SSL Client Certificate in
   the form of a PEM file if Konversation is built against KDE
   Platform v4.8.3 or higher.
 * Konversation now depends on KDE Platform v4.6.0 or higher and
   Qt v4.7.0 or higher.
 * Raw log tabs now use color coding to visually differenciate inbound
   and outbound messages, using the server message and channel message
   colors from the color settings respectively.
 * Queries now start with an info message listing the channels you
   and the other side have in common, i.e. that both of you are
   presently in.
 * The DCC Status transfer list update interval now depends on the
   graphics effects level setting in KDE System Settings
 * Fixed a bug causing the input box height not to be adjusted
   appropriately to fit the contents when the "Input box expands with text"
   option is enabled and the window is resized horizontally, causing
   the text to rewrap.
 * Fixed a bug causing the context menu for an item in the DCC Status
   transfer list to appear in the wrong position.
 * The list of placeholders available in Quick Button patterns now
   mention the previously undocumented "%k" placeholder for the current
   channel's key and is sorted alphabetically.
 * When a Quick Button pattern replaces the current input box contents
   (due to the presence of the "%n" expando in the pattern) they are
   now added to the input box history first.
 * Quick Button patterns now support a new "%i" placeholder that
   is replaced with the current contents of the input box.
 * The double-click action command for Watched Nicks list entries now
   supports command aliases.
 * Fixed a bug causing wildcard expansion to be performed on the
   input box contents when they start with a Command Alias
 * The Quick Buttons options now feature a new checkbox that
   toggles whether Quick Buttons that operate on nicknames will be
   shown alongside other nickname-related actions in context menus
   throughout Konversation.
 * The Topic tab in the Channel Options dialog has been redesigned and
   rewritten from scratch, featuring a much improved UI and many bug fixes
 * The size of the Channel Options dialog is now synchronized between
   the dialogs for different channels and remembered across application
   restarts.
 * The widths of the columns in the Ban List tab in the Channel Options
   dialog is now synchronized across all Channel Options dialogs.
 * Fixed a bug causing the topic at the top of channel tabs not to return
   to its encrypted form after the decryption key for a channel has
   been deleted.
 * Debug builds of Konversation now understand a "--nui" command line
   argument to disable the check for whether Konversation is already
   running, thus allowing multiple instances of Konversation to be started.
 * Part and Quit messages now show the hostmask of the subject, consistent
   with Join messages.
 * Fixed a bug causing the What's This help tooltip for nickname lists
   to show the regular user icon instead of the away icon as the away
   icon example.
 * The desktop notification for a completed incoming DCC file transfer
   now offers an action to open/run the received file.
 * The nickname list theme preview in the configuration dialog now
   uses the same background color as the actual nickname lists.
 * Various fixed to tab stops and margins in the configuration dialog pages.
 * Minor UI fixes for the Queue Tuner (opened by /queuetuner), correcting
  icon use and button labels.
 * Removed excess white space from several warning dialog messages.
 * Fixed a bug causing the Watched Nicks to spam the active tab with
   repeated WHOIS requests for someone on the Watched Nicks List after
   opening a query tab to them while they were offline.
 * Added an action to manually apply the user-configured auto-replace rules
   to the input box contents without sending the message, enabling user
   review before doing so.
 * Added the ability to set a different spell-checking language for every
   tab, from the context menu of the input box.
 * Fixed several bugs in preserving per-tab encoding settings across
   application restarts.
 * Link opening now properly respects KDE's file type associating
   settings instead of always opening a web browser.
 * Fix Konversation not saving the unchecked "... a channel invitation
   is received" warning dialog option in the Warning Dialogs list in the
   configuration dialog
 * Unchecking the "... a channel invitation is received" warning dialog
   option in the Warning Dialogs list in the configuration dialog now
   sets the behavior for future channel join invitations to always
   joining them.
 * The default behavior upon receiving a channel join invitation is
   now to ask the user, instead of silently accepting the invitation.
 * Server status tabs for networks listed in the Server List dialog
   now have a "Connect at Startup" checkbox in their context menu, similar
   to the "Join  on Connect" checkbox in the context menu of channel tabs.
 * Added a workaround for behavior in the Phonon multimedia library that
   could lead to crashes on application quit when using custom highlight
   notification sounds.
 * Fixed a bug causing an ambiguous shortcut warning dialog when using the
   default ESC keyboard shortcut to invoke the Focus Input Box action
   after the search has been opened and the Focus New Tabs option was
   disabled while a new tab was opened.
 * Fixed a bug causing multiple ignore list entries with the same pattern
   not to be preserved across application restarts.
 * Fixed a bug causing the tab label for open log viewer tabs to be
   set to "ChatWindowObject" when switching the tab bar position between

 * Build system improvements for kdepimlibs includes handling.
 * Made the code turning channel names into clickable links more strict
   about what types of trailing punctuation it incorporates into the link.
 * Fixed bugs causing currently joined channels not to react correctly to
   changes in the enabled state of the Automatic User Information Lookup
   setting.
 * The reaction to a change of the Automatic User Information Lookup interval
   setting has been improved considerably
 * All forms of opening a query (the '/query' command, clicking a nickname
   in the chat text display, double-clicking in the nickname list or the
   nickname list context menu action) now consistently move focus to an
   existing matching query tab, matching the behavior of various forms of
   joining an already-joined channel.
 * Minor visual (the selection decoration for server items now spans the
   whole row) and behavioral (when collapsing a network while one of its a
   server is selected, the selection is now moved to the network item instead
   of becoming invisible)
 * Fixed a bug causing the option to automatically focus new query tabs
   not to work correctly.
 * Fixed a bug causing IRC formatting state not to be reset at the end
   of a topic when showing it in a channel's chat text display, potentially
   causing the rest of the line to be malformatted.

 * If built against KDE Platform v4.8.3 or higher, the date column
   in the Url Catcher will now immediately reflect changes to the date
   format made in KDE's System Settings application.

   '/unban <#channel>' command.
 * Removing newlines in the Edit Paste dialog can now handle Windows-style
   carriage return line breaks and whitespace characters other than
   ASCII 0x20.
 * Showing line and paragraph indicators in the Edit Paste dialog's
   text entry field unfortunately had to be disabled for the time being
   due to a bug in the underlying Qt code.
 * Leaving the "Use custom version reply" option's text field empty now
   disables responding to CTCP VERSION requests entirely instead of sending
   empty responses.

 * In addition to the '/disconnect' command, the graphical 'Disconnect'
   action and the '/quit' command can now be used to cancel an
   in-progress automatic reconnect in the event of connection failure
   as well.
 * The '/disconnect' and '/reconnect' commands now take optional quit
   message parameters.
 * Fixed crashes when pressing the "Edit" buttons below the server or
   channel lists in the "New Network"/"Edit Network" dialogs after
   adding a new server or channel and there was no item selected
   before in the respective list.
 * Fixed bugs causing the "Edit" buttons below the server or channel
   lists in the "New Network"/"Edit Network" dialogs to edit the
   previously selected list items rather than the ones shown as
   selected after adding a new server or channel.
 * Fixed a bug that could cause outdated status information for
   nicks to be displayed in channel nickname lists after a reconnect.
 * Efficiency improvements for channel join.
 * Don't send PING in response to PONG if another PING is already
   scheduled to be sent in the future.
 * Fixed numerous cases in which Konversation would incorrectly
   apply the KDE system color scheme to input lines, nickname lists
   and the listview version of the tab bar. This general overhaul
   of the relevant code also brought about minor efficiency and
   memory usage improvements.
 * Fixed nickname lists not respecting the "Alternate Background"
   setting when set to use custom colors.
 * Fixed the listview version of the tab bar not greying out disconnected
   tabs when set to use custom colors.
 * Fixed a bug causing the processing of incoming CTCP CLIENTINFO and
   CTCP TIME requests not to take the ignore list into account.
 * The "Insert IRC Color" dialog will now add a leading zero to colors
   which have single-digit numbers in the '%C...' string it inserts into
   the input line, to allow the text that follows to start with a digit
   rather than such a digit getting interpreted as part of the color number.
 * Fixed a bug causing the Watched Nicknames Online nickname list for a
   network to be stored under the wrong network or lost entirely on
   application quit.
 * Fixed a bug causing the order of the Quick Buttons below the nickname
   list in channel tabs to be flipped every time the config dialog was OK'd.
 * Improved consistency of the filter fields in the URL Catcher and
   Channel List tabs with other KDE applications.
 * Correct use of singular or plural unit suffixes for several numeric
   preferences in the configuration dialog.
 * It is no longer possible to set the auto-way time to the nonsensical
   value of zero minutes. Rather, a minimum of one minute is now enforced.

- Update to 1.3 Final
  * Added support for DCC WHITEBOARD, bringing collaborative
    drawing to IRC.
  * When showing the dialog informing the user about the local target
    file for an incoming DCC file transfer already existing that
    dialog now includes the sizes of the local file and the file
    the sender is offering up.
   * The "Clear All Windows" action will now also resets the
     notification state of all tabs (i.e. removes active new message
     or highlight notifications from the tab bar).
   * several bugfixes
   * The text in notification messages used to be wrapped every 50
     characters, an old workaround for problems with KDE 3.x's bubble
     notifications. This has been removed now since it's no longer
     needed with modern notification frontends such as Plasma's,
     and produces rather ugly results there.
   * Made it possible again to initate DCC file transfers to a query
     partner by dragging files or URLs onto the chat text area of
     the query.
   * When building against the KDE Platform v4.4.3 libraries, the
     auto-away functionality will now make use of the new KIdleTime
     library to determine user activity and inactivity rather than
     use its own code.
   * SSL support now integrates with KDE's certificate handling
     again, as it used to in the KDE 3 version.
   * Not reacting to an SSL certificat validation error dialog in
     a timely manner should no longer result in Konversation locking
     up.
   * In-progress automatic reconnect in the event of connection
     failure can now be aborted by using the '/disconnect' command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 10:16:14 UTC 2010 - wstephenson@suse.de

- update to version 1.2.3
  * Increased robustness of DBUS IPC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 06:36:00 UTC 2010 - tittiatcoke@gmail.com

- update to version 1.2.2
  * Added support for passive DCC chat.
  * Made it possible to accept/reject DCC chats like DCC file transfers.
  * Added an option to auto-accept DCC chats (previously it would
    always auto-accept).
  * Added a confirmation dialog for closing DCC chats, consistent with
    other conversation tabs.
  * Improved the sanity-checking code for the validity of ports used
    in DCC operations.
  * Fixed connection attempts possibly stalling when there is a problem
    with executing the associated identity's pre-shell command
  * Fixed /setkey, /delkey and /showkey treating their target arguments
    (i.e. a channel or a query) case-sensitive.
  * Fixed the encryption key for a query getting lost if the other end
    changes their nickname.
  * Added support for KStatusNotifierItem, the new system tray API in KDE.
  * Fixed a bug causing multiple auto-replacements in a single message not to work.
  * Made it possible to include syntax normally used to refer to a subgroup
    of the matching pattern as normal text in the replacement pattern of a
    regular expression auto-replace, by escaping it like this: %%1.
  * Fixed a bug causing an empty MODE message to be sent to the server
    preceding the correct one when using /op, /deop and the like.
  * Fixed a bug causing as many mode chars as target nicknames given to
    commands like /op, /deop etc. to be sent as part of every single
    resultant MODE messages sent to the server.
  * Added support for amarok:// URLs in chat text views and channel topics.
  * Fixed a bug causing Konversation to treat "Page Up" and "Page Down"
    key events with any modifier (e.g. Ctrl) the same as without any modifier,
    making such combinations unavailable as shortcuts for other actions.
  * Fixed a bug causing the status bar to remain stuck displaying the
    description of a menu action if subsequently hovering other actions without
    a description set.
  * Further work on reducing the use of the qt3support/kde3support libraries
    throughout the codebase.
  * The design of the search bar has been made more consistent with the search
    bars found in other KDE applications (e.g. Konqueror, Konsole and KWrite).
  * Added a "--noautoconnect" command line argument to disable auto-connecting
    to any IRC networks on application startup.
  * The invite dialog now has a drop-down offering the options "Always ask",
    "Always join" and "Always ignore" for future default behavior, rather than
    just a "Don't ask again" checkbox that wasn't sufficient to cover all scenarios.
  * The "Hide Nicklist" action has been renamed "Show Nicklist" to comply with
    the KDE 4 HIG.
  * URLs are no longer decoded before being passed to the web browser, fixing
    the opening of some links from the chat text view.
  * Fixed a bug causing the application to crash when pressing the left or right
    arrow keys after selecting an active file transfer in the DCC Status tab's
    transfer list when using Qt 4.6.
  * Improved performance of the DCC Status tab's transfer list.
  * It's now possible to add nicknames to the Watched Nicknames Online list,
    as well as remove them, right from the tab rather than having to go to
    the config dialog.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause the "Choose Association" KDE address book
    integration action to create a new contact in the address book.
  * It's now possible to add a nickname to the watch list of all networks in
    the Watched Nicknames Online tab at once.
  * Fixed a bug causing the opening of all bookmarks in a bookmark folder at
    once not to work.
  * The ban list interface has seen a facelift.
  * The topic history list in the Channel Settings dialog has seen a number of
    behavioral and reliability improvements.
  * Updated various dialog layouts to better comply with the alignment rules
    of the KDE 4 HIG.
  * The URL list in the URL catcher tab now sports a new Date column and can be
    sorted. The sorting settings are saved and restored across sessions.
  * Fixed a bug causing the vertical spacing inbetween the regular mode checkboxen
    on the "Modes" tab of the Channel Settings dialog to change when the display
    of the advanced mode list was toggled or the dialog was resized.
  * The Join Channel dialog now sports a combo box listing all open connections
  * Fixed a bug causing the "Clear History" item in the context menu of the
    channel combobox in the "Join Channel" dialog not to clear the history correctly;
  * Fixed a bug causing a crash on Windows when middle-clicking the chat text view.
  * Fixed a bug causing the pasting of clipboard contents using keyboard shortcuts
    not to work when the chat text has keyboard focus.
  * Fixed a bug causing the setting or removing of a 'q' channel mode to be
    mistakenly announced as giving or taking channel owner privileges on networks
    where it's actually a type of ban.
  * Fixed a bug causing a crash when pressing the "Ok" button in the "Join Channel"
    dialog without entering anything in the dialog's "Channel:" input field beforehand.
  * More robust Unicode handling to make interaction with the D-Bus daemon more reliable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 13:23:07 UTC 2009 - tittiatcoke@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2.1
  * Fixed a crash when cancelling the warning dialog that is shown
    upon receiving two incoming DCC file transfer requests using
    the same file name.
  * Fixed a crash when using the "Clear Completed" action in the DCC
    Status tab after having previously used the "Clear" action to
    remove specific transfers from the transfer list.
  * Fixed a crash when using the "Clear" or "Clear Completed" action
    in the DCC Status tab after creating a mixed selection of removable
    (e.g. completed, or failed) and non-removable (e.g. sending) transfers
    and the last addition to the selection was a removable transfer.
  * Added a "Bookmark Tabs as Folder" feature.
  * Added the ability to open the contents of an entire bookmark folder at
    once (aka "Open Folder in Tabs").
  * Made the default generated bookmark titles more verbose: The Format is
    now "Channel (Network-or-Server)".
  * Added support for reacting to changes in network availability as reported
    by KDE's Solid subsystem. If the network goes down, Konversation will now
    no longer make futile attempts to reconnect the affected connections.
    Instead, it will reconnect once the network comes back up.
  * Variable expansion (%B, %C, %I, etc.) is no longer done in text segments
    recognized as URLs to avoid clashes with percent-encoded characters in URLs
    copied from web browsers, such as German umlauts.
  * Made tooltips for truncated labels in the listview version of the tab bar
    work again with newer versions of Qt.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the Watched Nicknames Online list to show the wrong
    or no tooltip when hovering a list item with the mouse pointer.
  * The default destination folder for incoming DCC file transfers is now the
    "Downloads paths" configured in System Settings or the equivalent in other
    desktop environments (under the hood, this is a shared XDG setting).
  * Making and then comitting unrelated changes in the Channel Settings dialog
    could cause unintentionally setting the channel's topic to an older version
    if someone else had changed the topic since the first time the dialog was
    opened or while the dialog was open, due to a bug in the code that avoids
    such external topic changes interfering with concurrent local editing of
    the topic. This has been fixed.
  * The contents of the topic edit field in the Channel Settings dialog will
    now reflect the selected item in the topic history list until the user
    starts editing.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause user mode changes occurring directly after
    joining a channel not to be reflected by the channel's nickname list.
  * Fixed a bug causing the "Open File" context menu action for DCC file
    transfer items in the transfer list in the DCC Status tab not to work for
    incoming file transfers.
  * Added support for RPL_HOSTHIDDEN.

- fix version to make it an upgrade from previous package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 13:37:35 UTC 2009 - wstephenson@novell.com

- Update to 1.2
  * When dragging a link from the chat text view, the drag object will now
    contain a plain text version in addition to the URL version. This allows
    dragging a link to places that don't accept URL drops, such as Konsole,
    the Konqueror address bar or Konversation's own input line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  3 12:37:47 UTC 2009 - wstephenson@novell.com

- Update to 1.2 RC 1
  * Fixed the scrollbar thumb not remaining at the bottom when the
    chat text view is resized
  * Fixed file transfer progress bar not updating
  * Fixed incoming DCC file transfer crash
  * Fixed keyboard focus bug when typing using dead keys
  * Fixed selection bug when showing remember line after a clicked
    link
  * Fixed a bug causing the automatic scroll-down not to work when
    more backlog is replayed than the viewport can show at once at
    channel join.
  * The "Advanced Modes" listing in the "Modes" tab of the Channel
    Settings dialog will now properly vertically expand as the
    dialog is resized even to a very large height.
  * Fixed crash while manipulating a channel's ban list.
  * Fixed a bug causing the moving of child tabs of a network tab
    in the treelist version of the tab bar not to work using the
    keyboard shortcuts, context menu actions or "Window" menu
    actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 21 14:13:11 UTC 2009 - tittiatcoke@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2 Beta 1
  * Added a topic widget for Konsole windows and hooked it
    up to the KPart's setWindowCaption signal
  * Added tooltips to items in the new DCC transfer lists that
    describe the transfer's status more verbosely.
  * Fixed the OSD stealing focus when it appears on Windows.
  * Added a "Manage Profiles" button to the information area above
    the terminal area in Konsole tabs.
  * Added SOCKS v5 and HTTP proxy support. Proxy credentials are
    stored in KWallet.
  * Moved the buttons in the DCC Status tab to a toolbar,
    similar to how things were already laid out in log viewer tabs.
  * Other bug fixes

- update to 1.2 Alpha 6: hotfix release addressing a DCC crash

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  5 17:51:56 CEST 2009 - beineri@opensuse.org

- update to 1.2 Alpha 5 release: significant performance and memory
  usage improvements in several areas of the application, such as
  channel nickname lists, backlog loading, Channel List tabs and the
  URL catcher - the latter two have also seen a fair number of inter-
  face refinements, making them much more enjoyable to use. The DCC
  subsystem has seen the addition of IPv6 support and a '/dcc get'
  command to accept an incoming file transfer from the input line.
  Various smaller additions and improvements have been made as well,
  including the usual share of bug fixes.

- update to 1.2 Alpha 4 release
  New features in this release include UPnP NAT traversal support
  for DCC file transfers and chats, DH1080 key exchange support for
  Blowfish encryption and the ability to automatically split very
  long actions (i.e. usage of the '/me' command) into multiple messages
  conforming to the maximum length of an IRC message (this was already
  supported for regular messages for some time).
- Added dependency for libqca2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 09:09:23 CEST 2009 - beineri@opensuse.org

- update to 1.2 Alpha 3 release: fair amount of annoying bugs en-
  countered in day-to-day usage, as well as a serious bug in
  handling NAMES messages from IRC servers. Also some UI changes
  that we'd like to get your feedback on: We've changed the default
  tab completion mode to "Cycle Nicklist", and we've removed the
  frame around the tab widget when using the listview version of
  the tab bar.
