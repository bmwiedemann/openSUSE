Tue Apr 13 04:34:12 UTC 2021 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 131.1.0
  * First release with semantic versioning. It has the roughly
    the same code as v131, but some symbol visibility changes and
    build enhancements to improve shared object usage and use as
    a packaged/installed library.
  * Removed kfc.h and kissfft_i32.hh from the install list since
    they are not as generally useful as the others
- Switch to cmake build
- Add kissfft subpackage and rename library subpackage to match
  library name
- Drop kissfft-shared.patch (no longer necessary)
- Drop kissfft-py3_1.patch and kissfft-py3_2.patch (merged
  upstream)
