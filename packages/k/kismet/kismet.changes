-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 19:43:03 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2019-12-R2
  A bugfix release for Kismet 2019-12, R2 solves a number of quirks
  which were quite annoying:
  * Solve a race condition in Linux with interface naming. Due to
    how the nl80211 layer handles interface naming, combined with
    how systemd can name interfaces on some systems, it was
    possible to have a race condition when Kismet defaulted to
    kismonX interface names, resulting in either errors or Kismet
    ignoring one of the interfaces.
  * Solve a free on an unused pointer in nl80211 vif creation. The
    new vif creation code doesn’t use the nl80211 flags
    sub-message when there are no flags to add, but tried to free
    it. This could cause a crash the first time trying to open a
    source, but the second time would succeed.
  * Fix TICC2540 USB devices. Some systems were very unhappy with
    the order in which the USB device was initialized; now it
    should be fine.
  * Work around the very broken RTL8812BU driver. While we don’t
    recommend this driver or these cards, due to a HUGE number of
    issues, Kismet will now do its best to open one and get it
    into monitor mode.
  * Much smoother operation with very very large numbers of
    sources. A side effect of the vif naming fix, interfaces are
    now initialized and opened one at a time. While this may take
    much longer to open huge numbers (dozens or more) of
    interfaces, it is much more reliable and much less likely to
    cause Kismet or kernel problems during the initial bring-up
    and firmware load of interfaces.
  * Minor output text fixes. Capture interface and base
    interface were swapped in some messages to the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 25 20:33:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2019-12-R1
  Bugfixes and performance boosts
  * Remove OpenMP/parallel processing; this resolves a massive
    CPU burn on even moderate numbers of devices.
  * Fix logging bug causing export of all devices every logging
    cycle, instead of only modified and new devices.
  * Revamped python-kismet-external using asyncio to prevent a
    large CPU wasting IO loop.
  * Bugfixes to the Linux netlink monitor controls to prefer
    nl80211, find existing monitor interfaces correctly, and to
    work on devices that don’t support IOxIWCTL iocontrols at all
    (AX200).
  * Switch to std::unordered_map hash maps for O(1) lookups
    whenever possible
  New features
  * BTLE packet capture and basic device display, using the
    aUbertooth One, CC2540, or nRF51822;
  * New SDR demodulators for ADSB (airplane) and AMR (power and
    water meter) with no external dependencies beyond librtlsdr
    and python3!
  * New ADSB mapping UI
  * BTLE support in the UI
  * New formatting options for ekjson to simplify export to other
    tools
  * Device present/missing alerts
  * ADSB geolocation
  * Detection of CVE-2019-17666 RTLWIFI vulnerabilities

- Package systemd service file
- Remove obsolete patch:
  * kismet-2011-03-R2-makefile.diff
- Update to version 2019-09-R1
  This is the new, MAJOR rewrite of Kismet! This version changes
  almost everything, hopefully for the better, including:
  * Web-based UI allowing for much simpler presentation of data
    and compatibility with mobile devices
  * Standard JSON-based data export for easy scripting against
    Kismet instances
  * Support for wireless protocols beyond Wi-Fi, like basic
    Bluetooth scanning, thermometer, and weather station detection
    with the RTL-SDR hardware, and more on the way
  * New remote-capture code optimized for binary size and RAM,
    allowing extremely low-end embedded devices to be used for
    packet capture
  * New logging format which can encapsulate complex information
    about devices, system state, alerts, messages, and packets in a
    single file with simple tools for extracting standard formats
  * Pcap-NG multi-interface logs with complete original headers,
    readable by Wireshark and other tools

- Kismet-2011-03-R2 released, includes:
- 2011-03-R2
  New release to address a crash bug in Kismet when operating as a drone
  (either kismet_server or kismet_drone).

- 2011-03-R1
  fixes problems with changes in ncurses 5.8 (for the few
  distributions which picked it up already) and is REQUIRED for Kismet
  to work with ncurses-5.8.  Also introduced is marginally more accurate
  GPS averaging (still all the problems of weighting and averaging,
  but eliminates the float drift), some compile time updates, other
  minor tweaks.

  Under the covers 2011-03 also contains the start of the new phy-neutral
  common tracker layer, which will be replacing the current model of an
  802.11-centric tracking layer.  Anyone working on capture plugins for
  non-dot11 protocols should start taking a look at the new tracking
  layer.  The dot11 tracking is being ported to the new layer and
  eventually they old tracking code will be disabled.

- 2011-01-R1
  Lots of bugfixes (netxml reference, 802.11d, mac80211 on legacy cards,
  client preferences, client display options)
  Ruby network API and example clients
  Wifi NIC performance shoot-out tool
  WPA Migration Mode detection
  GPS logging in PPI pcap files
  Per-capture source per-network and per-client signal tracking
  Packaging scripts

- 2010-07-R1 changes:
  Enhancements:
   Ruby interface and examples
   Proper TCP Async (for large numbers of drones and other situations)
   Add hidedata= option for "safer" sniffing in public environments
   Kluged escape handler for broken ncurses arrow handling on some systems
   Add --no-root option for zero-priv drone-only deploys
 
  Bugfixes:
   Fix installation on Ubuntu dash
