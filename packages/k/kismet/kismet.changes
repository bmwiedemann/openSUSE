- Update to version 2020-09-R3
  * Properly show messages from datasources
  * Properly show error and status messages from opening
    datasources, which previously were ignored. This should make
    seeing errors opening datasources much easier.
  * Fix bluetooth capture on some platforms
  * Some platforms / kernels / setups appear to not enable rfkill.
    The bluetooth hci capture source erroneously failed when no
    rfkill information was available.
  * Remove 221 IE tag subtype match requirement
  * Remove requiring a subtype of 0 on an IE221 tag for matching
    the manufacturer of otherwise unknown devices.
  * Fix potential crash in datasource panel
  * Fix a long-standing potential crash when the datasource panel
    is open in the UI caused by a race condition with the
    constructor and callbacks.
  * Fix race condition in launching datasources
  * Fix a long-standing race condition which could lead to some
    datasources not being opened properly or their types
    autodetected properly due to a race condition with the type
    probe code.
  * Increase precision of some doubles in JSON for GPS
  * Found some legacy serialization code which reduced the
    precision of some doubles (double-vector) which would cause
    GPS to display with less precision.
  * Don’t shut down messagebus processing thread until Kismet is
    fully exiting
  * The messagebus service thread could shut down before Kismet
    had finished spinning down, causing it to not show some of
    the errors causing the shutdown.
  * Fix moodycamel fast queue for gcc 9.2.0
  * Merge fix from cameron314/moodycamel to the fast concurrent
    queue library for compiling on gcc 9.2.0
  * Add new device locking API
  * Add new device locking API for internal range locking of
    devices to better protect records during updates between
    threads.

    properly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 19:43:03 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2019-12-R2
  A bugfix release for Kismet 2019-12, R2 solves a number of quirks
  which were quite annoying:
  * Solve a race condition in Linux with interface naming. Due to
    how the nl80211 layer handles interface naming, combined with
    how systemd can name interfaces on some systems, it was
    possible to have a race condition when Kismet defaulted to
    kismonX interface names, resulting in either errors or Kismet
    ignoring one of the interfaces.
  * Solve a free on an unused pointer in nl80211 vif creation. The
    new vif creation code doesn’t use the nl80211 flags
    sub-message when there are no flags to add, but tried to free
    it. This could cause a crash the first time trying to open a
    source, but the second time would succeed.
  * Fix TICC2540 USB devices. Some systems were very unhappy with
    the order in which the USB device was initialized; now it
    should be fine.
  * Work around the very broken RTL8812BU driver. While we don’t
    recommend this driver or these cards, due to a HUGE number of
    issues, Kismet will now do its best to open one and get it
    into monitor mode.
  * Much smoother operation with very very large numbers of
    sources. A side effect of the vif naming fix, interfaces are
    now initialized and opened one at a time. While this may take
    much longer to open huge numbers (dozens or more) of
    interfaces, it is much more reliable and much less likely to
    cause Kismet or kernel problems during the initial bring-up
    and firmware load of interfaces.
  * Minor output text fixes. Capture interface and base
    interface were swapped in some messages to the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 25 20:33:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2019-12-R1
  Bugfixes and performance boosts
  * Remove OpenMP/parallel processing; this resolves a massive
    CPU burn on even moderate numbers of devices.
  * Fix logging bug causing export of all devices every logging
    cycle, instead of only modified and new devices.
  * Revamped python-kismet-external using asyncio to prevent a
    large CPU wasting IO loop.
  * Bugfixes to the Linux netlink monitor controls to prefer
    nl80211, find existing monitor interfaces correctly, and to
    work on devices that don’t support IOxIWCTL iocontrols at all
    (AX200).
  * Switch to std::unordered_map hash maps for O(1) lookups
    whenever possible
  New features
  * BTLE packet capture and basic device display, using the
    aUbertooth One, CC2540, or nRF51822;
  * New SDR demodulators for ADSB (airplane) and AMR (power and
    water meter) with no external dependencies beyond librtlsdr
    and python3!
  * New ADSB mapping UI
  * BTLE support in the UI
  * New formatting options for ekjson to simplify export to other
    tools
  * Device present/missing alerts
  * ADSB geolocation
  * Detection of CVE-2019-17666 RTLWIFI vulnerabilities

- Package systemd service file
- Remove obsolete patch:
  * kismet-2011-03-R2-makefile.diff
- Update to version 2019-09-R1
  This is the new, MAJOR rewrite of Kismet! This version changes
  almost everything, hopefully for the better, including:
  * Web-based UI allowing for much simpler presentation of data
    and compatibility with mobile devices
  * Standard JSON-based data export for easy scripting against
    Kismet instances
  * Support for wireless protocols beyond Wi-Fi, like basic
    Bluetooth scanning, thermometer, and weather station detection
    with the RTL-SDR hardware, and more on the way
  * New remote-capture code optimized for binary size and RAM,
    allowing extremely low-end embedded devices to be used for
    packet capture
  * New logging format which can encapsulate complex information
    about devices, system state, alerts, messages, and packets in a
    single file with simple tools for extracting standard formats
  * Pcap-NG multi-interface logs with complete original headers,
    readable by Wireshark and other tools

- 2011-03-R2
  New release to address a crash bug in Kismet when operating as a drone
  (either kismet_server or kismet_drone).

  fixes problems with changes in ncurses 5.8 (for the few
  distributions which picked it up already) and is REQUIRED for Kismet
  to work with ncurses-5.8.  Also introduced is marginally more accurate
  GPS averaging (still all the problems of weighting and averaging,
  but eliminates the float drift), some compile time updates, other
  minor tweaks.

  common tracker layer, which will be replacing the current model of an
  802.11-centric tracking layer.  Anyone working on capture plugins for
  non-dot11 protocols should start taking a look at the new tracking
  layer.  The dot11 tracking is being ported to the new layer and
  eventually they old tracking code will be disabled.

  client preferences, client display options)
  Ruby network API and example clients
