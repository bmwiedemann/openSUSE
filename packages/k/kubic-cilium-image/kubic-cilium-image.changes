  cilium: Add libboringssl0 package

  This is a temporary solution for boo#1130050 - a bug in boringssl package
  which results in the following kiwi error:

  ``` buildinfo is broken... it says: unresolvable: have choice for
  libcrypto.so.0()(64bit) needed by cilium-proxy: boringssl-devel
  libboringssl0
       have choice for libdecrepit.so.0()(64bit) needed by cilium-proxy:
  boringssl-devel libboringssl0
       have choice for libssl.so.0()(64bit) needed by cilium-proxy:

  cilium: Add openSUSE-release-ftp in Kubic

  This is the fix for the following error in Cilium Kubic image:

  ``` buildinfo is broken... it says: unresolvable: have choice for
  product_flavor(openSUSE) needed by openSUSE-release: openSUSE-release-dvd
  openSUSE-release-ftp [...]
  ```

  It's solved by choosing openSUSE-release-ftp as a bootstrap package.

- Commit 72c9478 by Michal Rostecki mrostecki@opensuse.org 

  pre_checkin: Allow to define extra bootstrap packages

  This change allows to define packages section of type bootstrap per product
  (kubic, caasp) by creating a file named
  `${product}-extra-bootstrap-packages` (i.e. `kubic-extra-packages` or
  `caasp-extra-packages`). Kiwi template, in order to support that 
  functionality, has to contain `_EXTRA_BOOTSTRAP_PACKAGES_` marker.

  The motivation behind it is the fact that some openSUSE packages require 
  providers of product_flavor(openSUSE). The common solution for that is to
  install i.e. openSUSE-release-ftp as a bootstrap package. However, that
  problem and solution are valid only in openSUSE, not in SLE.

  report a failre when it is executed having nothing new to commit at OBS.

  Distinguish between namespace and product

  For caasp we started using namespaces like 'caasp/head' or 'caasp/vX'. The
  slash is not an accepted character for 'name' attribute of <image> section.
  The image name ends up to the filename, thus adding slashes is prohibited
  there.

  Adding custom caasp namespaces

- Commit 92c129f by David Cassany dcassany@suse.de 

  Make pre_checkin.sh sript more usable

  With this commit pre_checkin.sh script does no create the changes file by
  default, so it can easily be used to recreate the KIWI files while testing
  and debugging without requiring to commit anything. Also it only recreates
  the KIWI files for the given product (caasp|kubic), kubic is the default if
  none is given.

  Add additional tags for images

  With this commit images will be tagged with three different tags:

  - <name>:<long_version>
  - <name>:<long_version>-<release>

  With change there will be at least a unique tag per build and a semistable
  tag, as the short_version is not expected to change within a distro release
  cycle.
