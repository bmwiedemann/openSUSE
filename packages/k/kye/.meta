  <title>Logic puzzle game with arcade elements</title>
  <description>This is a clone of the original Kye game for Windows, by Colin Garbutt.

Kye is a puzzle game with arcade game elements. The game takes place
in a small playing area, where the player controls Kye - a
distinctive green blob. The player moves around and tries to collect
all of the diamonds. However, there are many other objects in the
game, which can obstruct, trap or kill the Kye.

Kye is one of those games like Chess, where a small number of
different playing pieces, obeying simple rules, combine to create a
game of enormous variety and complexity.</description>
