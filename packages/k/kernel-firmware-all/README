kernel-firmware-all
===================

This package is a catch-all compatibility metapackage for providing
all files that have been provided by kernel-firmware package.

The actual contents of firmware files are found in kernel-firmware-*
subpackages in a compressed format.

Note that the version number of this package is almost fixed, and it
doesn't have much meaning.  For the changes in the firmware files,
refer to each kernel-firmware-* subpackage, instead.
