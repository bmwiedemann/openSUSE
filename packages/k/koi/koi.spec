%description
Koi is a program designed to provide the KDE Plasma Desktop functionality
to automatically switch between light and dark themes. Koi is under active
development, and while it is stable enough to use daily, expect bugs. Koi is
designed to be used with Plasma, and while some features may function under
different desktop environments, they are unlikely to work and untested.
