- Update to new upstream release version 0.2.3
  * Fixed the use of the new tray icon.
  * Updated new tray icons -> LIGHT/DARK 
  (Tray icon changes after hoovering with mouse cursor over the tray icon.)
  * Added feature to autostart Koi as hidden and switch themes, 
  even after system startup.
  * Updated `wm_class`
  * Fixed build failure
  * Reference to AppImage
  * Binary executable file renamed from `Koi` to `koi`
  * Fixed indentation
  * Updated README
  * Added function restart `krunner` to refresh theming after switching themes.
  * Modified the way to change `plasma-style` using `plasma-apply-desktoptheme`.
  It should now be more consistent (especially with KDE Plasma 5.26 
  and later versions), the modification reduces the complexity of the code.
  * Improved the plasma restart code for `kvantum`.
  It replaces the usage of kill with `kquitapp5` command
  to be able to wait before starting plasmashell.
  It may improve stability of `plasma-shell restart` by avoiding
  some failures due to starting `plasmashell` session
  while the previous process did not finish.
