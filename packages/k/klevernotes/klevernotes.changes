- Update to 1.1.0
  * KleverNotes parser has been switched to md4qt
  * The toolbar is now more precise for removing specific
    Markdown tags but also to apply them.
  * The parsing is now done on a separated thread, so parsing
    very large notes should still be smooth
  * The editor now has the abilty to be "WYSIWYG"
