  * adjust pci address tests to consider the new virtio-iscsi controller
  * Remove AfterEach cleanup so we can capture VM/VMI state in overal aftereach cleanup instead of losing it.
  * Disable complex tests for now.
  * HotplugVolumes feature gate
  * Set grace period on attachment pod to 0 to have faster removal of the volumes when not removed by the controller. Added functional test to ensure the VMI goes into failed state when attachment pod is deleted. Added functional test to ensure the VMI is no longer migrateable after a volume is hotplugged.
  * Added functional tests with block volumes. Fixed functional attachment logic.
  * Added VMI attach/detach functional tests. Increased timeout on tests. Fixed typo in reason message
  * Fixed bug in how device names were calculated. Added functional test that adds a bunch of volumes, removes one, add a different one, and expects the device name to be the one just removed. Then adds the removed one back and expects the device name to be a new one. Added unit tests.
  * Improve error messaging during hotplug subresource add/removew
  * Fixes issue with VolumeRequests validation on the VM
  * Fix some issues pointed out in review. Fixed functional test with 5 adds and deletes. Added new functional test to test various adds and deletes.
  * Addes abilty to watch for libvirt device add/remove events for hotplug volumes
  * Updated and added functional tests. Added storage directory for storage related functional tests similar to networking. Fixed various issues found by the functional tests.
  * Attach disk to VM
  * VM controller unit tests for volume hotplug
  * Ensure we only add/remove volume operations are only performed if needed

  * Change phase/message/reason from hotplug struct to main VolumeStatus struct. Address some review comments
  * Automatically add virtio-scsi controller to all VMIs.
  * Updated vmi controller to separate sync and status update to follow KubeVirt guidelines. Updated unit test tests to match and added some extra unit tests for the new status update function.
  * Updated update-admission webhook to include verifying the structure of disks and volumes as well as call the create admission verifier to ensure nothing else slips through.
  * Added attachment pod life cycle functions to vmi-controller. Added unit tests for new functions
  * Attachment POD life-cycle code, including updating VMI status.
  * Update VMI admission webhook to allow modification of the disks and volumes section of the VMI Spec. This modification is needed to allow for disk hotplugging to happen. Only internal KubeVirt Service Accounts are eligible to modify the spec. Once we have the appropriate sub resources, users can call those to have it modify the spec on their behalf
