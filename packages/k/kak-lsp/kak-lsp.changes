  * Experimental LSP client capabilities can now be enabled via kak-lsp.toml.
  * Fix crash on multiple language servers when one server doesn't support code actions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 18 04:13:32 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <obs@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 17.1.1:
  * Default configuration for Svelte via svelte-language-server.
  * The language server stderr is logged eagerly instead of only after server exit; (useful for when servers like rust-analyzer crash).
  * Support dynamic for registration semantic tokens via textDocument/semanticTokens.
  * lsp-code-actions has learned to filter by code action kind. This should obsolete the lsp-code-action command which has been hidden and deprecated.
  * lsp-code-actions learned the -auto-single switch to instantly run if there is only one matching code action.
  * Fixed a case where a legacy `kak-lsp.toml` specifying the same server for multiple languages would drop all but one language.
  * Some hover info had extra trailing whitespace, which is now trimmed properly.
  * Hover info containing ASCII-art tables as popular in some flavors of Markdown is now rendered properly.    The default config now enables inlay hints also for recent version of Scala Metals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 28 23:55:31 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to 17.0.1:
  * New default server for Nix, nil, replacing rnix-lsp.
  * The gopls usePlaceholders setting now defaults to true in the default config,
    make sure to either add a mapping for lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders
    or disable snippets.
  * gopls default config has been changed so inlay (type) hints require no
    gopls-specific knobs to turn on. As with other servers, inlay hints are only
    requested when lsp-inlay-hints-enabled is used.
  * The default config for HTML/CSS/JSON has been updated to use
    vscode-{html,css,json}-language-server as server command instead of
    vscode-{html,css,json}-languageserver.
  * Support for watching files (workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles) is now disabled
    by default to avoid performance problems.
  * Inlay code lenses (used by OCaml and Haskell language servers) are now
    shown after the referenced line. This requires Kakoune version >= 2024.
  * lsp-auto-hover-enable no longer takes an argument; that functionality has
    been moved to lsp-auto-hover-buffer-enable, and it no longer magically spawns
    a client.
  * Removed lsp-connect experimental command.
  * New commands jump-{next,previous} (which have also been added to Kakoune)
    replace and deprecate lsp-{next,previous}.
  * lsp-document-symbol no longer renders the same filename in every single
    line. Commands like jump-next and <ret> still work as before.
  * New option lsp_hover_max_info_lines replaces and deprecates
    lsp_hover_max_lines which now defaults to -1 which means
    lsp_hover_max_info_lines is used to control lines of information in the
    hover box.
  * New option lsp_hover_max_diagnostic_lines to limit the lines for diagnostics
    in the hover box.
  * Fix gopls code actions like "Extract function".
  * Various improvements to compatibility with old Kakoune.
  * Fix startup error when both lsp.kak and Kakoune's jump.kak are autoloaded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 08:46:55 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update specfile:
  * kak-lsp is now called as kakoune-lsp so we add a Provides.
  * update URL of sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 00:44:10 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update specfile:
  * top-level folder of extracted source is kakoune-lsp-16.0.0
  * explicit build requirement of cargo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 00:39:28 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 16.0.0:
  * The modeline shows breadcrumbs like somemodule > someclass > somefunction
  to indicate the symbol around the main cursor.
  * lsp-document-symbols now renders symbols in a tree.
  * lsp_auto_show_code_actions (which renders a lightbulb in the modeline)
  now defaults to true.
  * lsp-code-lens can now run the test at cursor with rust-analyzer. Fixes:
  * lsp-inlay-diagnostics no longer jump around when the cursor is moved
  over the diagnostics. To use this feature, use Kakoune version >= 2024
  (not yet release, consider building from source).
  * When LSP integration is enabled, then disabled and enabled again, the
  KakEnd hook failed to ask the server to exit, which has been fixed.
  * lsp-auto-hover-enable now only re-renders hover info when the main
  selection changes. This means that :info is no longer shadowed immediately
  by auto hover.
  * Completion snippets (accessed via lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders)
  can now be nested, making it possible to cycle through the arguments of
  nested function calls.
  * In some cases, selecting completions provided by rust-analyzer would labels
  with extra characters (like self.some_method(…)) which has been fixed.
  * completionItem.additionalTextEdits are now applied also when the server
  does not support completionItem/resolve.
  * Snippet metacharacters are now properly escaped, removing spurious
  backslashes from inserted completions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 25 09:42:34 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 19 10:48:26 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Updates to version 14.2.0:
  * Additions:
      - Default configuration for CMake.
      - If there are no code actions in the main selection, lsp-code-actions will show code actions from anywhere on a selected line, to make it easier to perform quick-fixes.
      - If requested by the language server, kak-lsp will recursively watch the entire root directory for file changes and forward them to the server via workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles (#649).
      - kak-lsp now asks the server to cancel stale requests (#666).
      - lsp-did-change is async again, which can improve performance (#667).
      - kak-lsp is published to crates.io for easy installation (#660).
  * Fixes:
      - Fix race conditions when spinning up a new server in "kak-lsp --request" (#654), and in "lsp-hover-buffer" (#664).
      - Send inlay hints and semantic tokens only after buffer changes (#663).
- Use zstd compression for vendored dep tarball

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 12 00:27:08 UTC 2022 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Update to version 14.1.0:
  * Additions:
    - Default language server for protobuf.
    - Added support for `codeAction/resolve`, which allows to use code 
      actions sent by Deno for example.
    - The recommended mappings have been augmented by new command 
      `lsp-diagnostic-object` to jump to next/previous diagnostics.
    - `lsp-auto-signature-help-enable` now shows an info box by default,
      and formats the active parameter in a bold font.
    - `lsp-definition` and friends now select the symbol name instead of merely 
      placing the cursor at symbol start. Same for `lsp-find-error`.
    - `lsp-highlight-references` now selects all references in the current buffer.
    - New `lsp-inlay-code-lenses-enable` command allows to render code 
      lenses as virtual text (#623).
    - The support for `filterText` in completions no longer depends on an 
      out-of-tree Kakoune feature.

  * Fixes:
    - Fix lags due to `rust-analyzer` sending a ton of progress reports.
    - `lsp-rename` will now write hidden buffers that are affected by the rename, 
      to give the language server and other external tools a more consistent 
      view of affected files.
    - Suppress "language server not initialized" errors that originate from hooks.
    - Fix a glitch when a line has both a code lens and an inline diagnostic.
    - When talking to servers that don't support UTF-8 byte-offsets, `kak-lsp` 
      now adheres to the LSP specification by treating column-offsets 
      as UTF-16 Code Units instead of Unicode Code Points.
