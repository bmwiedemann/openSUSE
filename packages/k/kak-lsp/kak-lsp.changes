- Update specfile:
  * kak-lsp is now called as kakoune-lsp so we add a Provides.
  * update URL of sources.

Sun Mar  3 00:44:10 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update specfile:
  * top-level folder of extracted source is kakoune-lsp-16.0.0
  * explicit build requirement of cargo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 00:39:28 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 16.0.0:
  * The modeline shows breadcrumbs like somemodule > someclass > somefunction
  to indicate the symbol around the main cursor.
  * lsp-document-symbols now renders symbols in a tree.
  * lsp_auto_show_code_actions (which renders a lightbulb in the modeline)
  now defaults to true.
  * lsp-code-lens can now run the test at cursor with rust-analyzer. Fixes:
  * lsp-inlay-diagnostics no longer jump around when the cursor is moved
  over the diagnostics. To use this feature, use Kakoune version >= 2024
  (not yet release, consider building from source).
  * When LSP integration is enabled, then disabled and enabled again, the
  KakEnd hook failed to ask the server to exit, which has been fixed.
  * lsp-auto-hover-enable now only re-renders hover info when the main
  selection changes. This means that :info is no longer shadowed immediately
  by auto hover.
  * Completion snippets (accessed via lsp-snippets-select-next-placeholders)
  can now be nested, making it possible to cycle through the arguments of
  nested function calls.
  * In some cases, selecting completions provided by rust-analyzer would labels
  with extra characters (like self.some_method(â€¦)) which has been fixed.
  * completionItem.additionalTextEdits are now applied also when the server
  does not support completionItem/resolve.
  * Snippet metacharacters are now properly escaped, removing spurious
  backslashes from inserted completions.

Sun Feb 19 10:48:26 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Updates to version 14.2.0:
  * Additions:
      - Default configuration for CMake.
      - If there are no code actions in the main selection, lsp-code-actions will show code actions from anywhere on a selected line, to make it easier to perform quick-fixes.
      - If requested by the language server, kak-lsp will recursively watch the entire root directory for file changes and forward them to the server via workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles (#649).
      - kak-lsp now asks the server to cancel stale requests (#666).
      - lsp-did-change is async again, which can improve performance (#667).
      - kak-lsp is published to crates.io for easy installation (#660).
  * Fixes:
      - Fix race conditions when spinning up a new server in "kak-lsp --request" (#654), and in "lsp-hover-buffer" (#664).
      - Send inlay hints and semantic tokens only after buffer changes (#663).
- Use zstd compression for vendored dep tarball

Sat Nov 12 00:27:08 UTC 2022 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Update to version 14.1.0:
  * Additions:
    - Default language server for protobuf.
    - Added support for `codeAction/resolve`, which allows to use code 
      actions sent by Deno for example.
    - The recommended mappings have been augmented by new command 
      `lsp-diagnostic-object` to jump to next/previous diagnostics.
    - `lsp-auto-signature-help-enable` now shows an info box by default,
      and formats the active parameter in a bold font.
    - `lsp-definition` and friends now select the symbol name instead of merely 
      placing the cursor at symbol start. Same for `lsp-find-error`.
    - `lsp-highlight-references` now selects all references in the current buffer.
    - New `lsp-inlay-code-lenses-enable` command allows to render code 
      lenses as virtual text (#623).
    - The support for `filterText` in completions no longer depends on an 
      out-of-tree Kakoune feature.

  * Fixes:
    - Fix lags due to `rust-analyzer` sending a ton of progress reports.
    - `lsp-rename` will now write hidden buffers that are affected by the rename, 
      to give the language server and other external tools a more consistent 
      view of affected files.
    - Suppress "language server not initialized" errors that originate from hooks.
    - Fix a glitch when a line has both a code lens and an inline diagnostic.
    - When talking to servers that don't support UTF-8 byte-offsets, `kak-lsp` 
      now adheres to the LSP specification by treating column-offsets 
      as UTF-16 Code Units instead of Unicode Code Points.
