- Updates to version 14.2.0:
  * Additions:
      - Default configuration for CMake.
      - If there are no code actions in the main selection, lsp-code-actions will show code actions from anywhere on a selected line, to make it easier to perform quick-fixes.
      - If requested by the language server, kak-lsp will recursively watch the entire root directory for file changes and forward them to the server via workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles (#649).
      - kak-lsp now asks the server to cancel stale requests (#666).
      - lsp-did-change is async again, which can improve performance (#667).
      - kak-lsp is published to crates.io for easy installation (#660).
  * Fixes:
      - Fix race conditions when spinning up a new server in "kak-lsp --request" (#654), and in "lsp-hover-buffer" (#664).
      - Send inlay hints and semantic tokens only after buffer changes (#663).
- Use zstd compression for vendored dep tarball

- Update to version 14.1.0:
  * Additions:
    - Default language server for protobuf.
    - Added support for `codeAction/resolve`, which allows to use code 
      actions sent by Deno for example.
    - The recommended mappings have been augmented by new command 
      `lsp-diagnostic-object` to jump to next/previous diagnostics.
    - `lsp-auto-signature-help-enable` now shows an info box by default,
      and formats the active parameter in a bold font.
    - `lsp-definition` and friends now select the symbol name instead of merely 
      placing the cursor at symbol start. Same for `lsp-find-error`.
    - `lsp-highlight-references` now selects all references in the current buffer.
    - New `lsp-inlay-code-lenses-enable` command allows to render code 
      lenses as virtual text (#623).
    - The support for `filterText` in completions no longer depends on an 
      out-of-tree Kakoune feature.

  * Fixes:
    - Fix lags due to `rust-analyzer` sending a ton of progress reports.
    - `lsp-rename` will now write hidden buffers that are affected by the rename, 
      to give the language server and other external tools a more consistent 
      view of affected files.
    - Suppress "language server not initialized" errors that originate from hooks.
    - Fix a glitch when a line has both a code lens and an inline diagnostic.
    - When talking to servers that don't support UTF-8 byte-offsets, `kak-lsp` 
      now adheres to the LSP specification by treating column-offsets 
      as UTF-16 Code Units instead of Unicode Code Points.
