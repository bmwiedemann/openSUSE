  <title>Daemon for in-kernel TLS handshake</title>
  <description>In-kernel TLS consumers need a mechanism to perform TLS handshakes on a connected socket to negotiate TLS session parameters that can then be programmed into the kernel's TLS record protocol engine.

This package of software provides a TLS handshake user agent that listens for kernel requests and then materializes a user space socket endpoint on which to perform these handshakes. The resulting negotiated session parameters are passed back to the kernel via standard kTLS socket options.</description>
