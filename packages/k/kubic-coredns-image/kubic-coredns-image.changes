  Do not fail if no new change log entries are found

  This commit makes pre_checkin.sh script to exit 0 if no new changelog 
  entries are found (when using --mkchanges flag). This way the CI does not
  report a failre when it is executed having nothing new to commit at OBS.

  Distinguish between namespace and product

  For caasp we started using namespaces like 'caasp/head' or 'caasp/vX'. The
  slash is not an accepted character for 'name' attribute of <image> section.
  The image name ends up to the filename, thus adding slashes is prohibited
  there.

  with image namespace of `caasp/v4`.

  Make pre_checkin.sh sript more usable

  With this commit pre_checkin.sh script does no create the changes file by
  default, so it can easily be used to recreate the KIWI files while testing
  and debugging without requiring to commit anything. Also it only recreates
  the KIWI files for the given product (caasp|kubic), kubic is the default if
  none is given.

  pre_checkin: Allow to define extra packages

  This change allows to define extra packages per product (kubic, caasp) by
  creating a file named `${product}-extra-packages` (i.e.
  `kubic-extra-packages` or `caasp-extra-packages`). Kiwi template, in order
  to support extra packages, has to contain
  `_EXTRA_PACKAGES_` marker.
