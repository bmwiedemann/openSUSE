%description
K8up is a Kubernetes backup operator based on Restic that will handle PVC and
application backups on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

Just create a schedule and a credentials object in the namespace you’d like to
backup. It’s that easy. K8up takes care of the rest. It also provides a
Prometheus endpoint for monitoring.

K8up is production ready. It is used in production deployments since 2019.

This package contains the CLI.
