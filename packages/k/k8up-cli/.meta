  <title>CLI for the K8up Kubernetes and OpenShift Backup Operator</title>
  <description>K8up is a Kubernetes backup operator based on Restic that will handle PVC and application backups on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

Just create a schedule and a credentials object in the namespace you’d like to backup. It’s that easy. K8up takes care of the rest. It also provides a Prometheus endpoint for monitoring.

K8up is production ready. It is used in production deployments since 2019.</description>
