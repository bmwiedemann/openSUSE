- Version 0.20.1

  - Blacklisted QQuickWidget with window dragging.
  - Made the workaround for bad hard-coded styles of line-edits less strict.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 31 23:04:34 UTC 2021 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.20.0

  - Fixed drawing of view-items with right-aligned decorations.
  - Added an option for always centering normal tabs (in contrast to the document mode).
  - Added an option (to Kvantum Manager) for styling vertical toolbars.
  - Fixed a small problem in tab overlapping.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 25 02:03:54 UTC 2021 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.19.0

  - Fixes and improvements to window dragging, especially from buttons.
  - Added an option (to Kvantum Manager) for setting the toolbar
    icon size to the font height if possible (it's the special value
    of Kvantum Manager → Configure Active Theme → Sizes & Delays → Toolbar icon:).
  - Better drawing of view-items.
  - Fixed a rare problem in transient scrollbars. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  5 09:34:13 UTC 2021 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.18.0

- The main feature of this release is a better window dragging
  with Qt ≥ 5.15. It works under X11 and Wayland alike by calling
  the window manager correctly. It also allows dragging from
  buttons (with an option in Kvantum Manager).

- Some other changes:

- Fixed the centered form layouts.
- Made toolbars unmovable by default.
- Better widths for push buttons, tabs and menus.
- Draw the icon of a menubar item instead of its text if it's
  given.
- A new theme is added (KvMojaveMixed1, a variant of KvMojaveMixed)
  and some themes are polished.
- Removed the scroll jump workaround. It interfered with 
  animations and cluttered the code to partially compensate for
  a Qt bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  3 01:22:11 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.17.0

- Also, take care of widgets without interior SVG elements on a menu
  that has a high contrast with the window (a possible scenario that
  hasn't happened with any theme so far).
- A workaround for a rare problem in QWidgetAction when menus have
  a high contrast with windows.
- Fixed the text color of thin progressbars inside stylable toolbars
  of dark-and-light themes.
- More accurate calculation of spinbox width under special
  circumstances.
- Distinguish popup indicators from other button indicators on
  mouseover. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 10 22:29:39 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.16.1

- More explicitness about the color group when getting colors from the standard panel. This fixes a small problem in inactive line-edits of some themes.
- Made the toolbar of recent versions of Krita stylable. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 22:39:09 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.16.0

- Set the scroll indicator size of tabs to that of toolbar buttons.
- Fixed a rare issue in the frame size of grouped elements.
- Added an option to Kvantum Manager for enabling window translucency with non-integer scale factors after showing a warning.
- A workaround for a rare case of Qt's contradicting QStyle in drawing spin boxes.
- Fixed the height of combo menu separators.
- Reset widget palettes on changing style from and to Kvantum. This fixes several problems with on-the-fly style changes, so that an app restart won't be needed in most cases.
- Updated the code for Qt 5.15.
- Added a workaround for a regression in Qt 5.15, which results in QStyleOptionTab reporting an incorrect tab position.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 02:47:25 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.15.3

- Better calculations for progressbars.
- Aligned a menu-item's text with others' if its icon isn't null but its pixmap is.
- Added a workaround for a small issue in the toolbar timer of Audacious 4.0.
- Removed old stuff from installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  5 04:32:16 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.15.2

- When compensating for menu shadows, consider the cursor position as the last resort.
- Consider RTL in QCommandLinkButton (although Qt doesn't). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Version 0.15.1

- Fixed a crash in Kleopatra's settings dialog.
- Added some dialog button icons for Qt ≥ 5.14.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 06:33:32 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.15.0

- Added an option (to Kvantum Manager) for horizontally centered forms.
- Handled the device pixel ratio more locally — because, apparently, Wayland can give different pixel ratios to different screens.
- Added KvMojaveMixed, a version of KvMojaveLight with dark menubar and primary toolbar.
- Added a workaround for codes that change a line-edit's base color (like in Kate and Konsole).
- Don't set WA_NoSystemBackground with hard-coded translucency. (This solves the problem of Konsole's transparent menubar with some translucent themes.)
- Milder gradient for menus of the default theme. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 11:34:27 UTC 2020 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.14.1

- Version 0.14.0

- Prevent toolbar arrow on showing kvantumpreview.
- Guarantee correct symbolic icon colors for combos inside toolbars.

- Removed the redundant key "no_focus_rect".
- Safeguard against a badly edited kvconfig file when writing to it with Kvantum Manager.
- Added a (temporary) workaround for a nasty bug about text translucency in Qt 5.14.0.
- Handle PlaceholderText with Qt ≥ 5.12.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  9 01:22:55 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.13.0

- In tab size calculation, consider the actual tab icon size instead of PM_TabBarIconSize if it exists.

- -add patch from upstream:  01-Prevent-menus-from-switching-screen-with-multi-screen-setup.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 05:56:38 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Version 0.12.1
 - Added a hacking option for kinetic scrolling to Kvantum Manager. Although Qt's kinetic scrolling has bugs, it doesn't cause crashes with Qt ≥ 5.13.1.
 - Fixed problems in updating the GUI of Kvantum Manager on theme change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 00:35:26 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Restored Qt4 compilation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  2 05:59:22 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- A workaround for a Qt bug that causes drawing problems with non-integer scale factors. They can be seen with Fusion too but become intense with window SVG gradient and/or translucency.
- Avoid ugly backgrounds behind menu scroller arrows.
- Forcefully prevent stylesheets from ruining combo menus.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 25 04:11:33 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Ignore the disabled state of tree expanders (because some apps, like Dolphin, don't set the state to enabled).
- Removed the wayland menu translucency workaround for Qt ≥ 5.12.
- When giving a transparent background to QComboBoxPrivateContainer with combo menus, create the transparency by setting the alpha of the real background color to zero. This works around the problem in Lyx's combo menu.
- Milder gradient for the default theme's tab frame interior. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 16 03:37:38 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- A workaround for the bug in Qt 5.13.1 → QWidget::setAttribute(), when the app style is changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  6 03:47:04 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added a new option for the click behavior with 3 values for following the current DE or using single or double click (and removed the old click option).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 04:25:14 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Basic support for FreeBSD.
 
-Version 0.11.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 04:24:50 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added a key (to Kvantum Manager) for removing all focus rectangles.
- Disable the context menu for transient scrollbars (because of the hover bug in Qt5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 12 06:49:53 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added a low-contrast theme (KvBlender) inspired by Blender.
- Added a key to remove extra generic frames that some apps may draw.
- Also consider the "disabled" state when drawing rounded frames with separate expanded frame elements (it's used by progressbar indicator).
- Exclude toolbars whose appearances are modified by stylesheets from stylable toolbars.
- Don't animate the state change of generic frames if there is no top focused frame (to prevent probable flashes).
- When removing translucency from the base color in special cases, also consider the window color behind it.
- Make the alternate base color opaque by applying it over the base color because some apps may ignore its translucency.
- No disabled state for toolbars because, otherwise, it would be both ugly and useless.
- Prevent tiny busy indicators with rounded progressbars.
- More precise calculations related to shadows and blurring of menus/tooltips, especially for preventing 1-px blurred strips outside menu/tooltip borders.
- Replaced the Qt methods that were deprecated by Qt 5.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 06:44:10 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Fixed toolbar horizontal extension indicator with HDPI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 00:40:25 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>
-Version 11.1
-  Use native file dialog in Kvantum Manager.

- Since HDPI is supported by KDE's blur effect with Qt ≥ 5.12, disable Kvantum's workaround for those versions.
- Explicitly set the minimum Qt version to 5.9.0.
- Use QStringLiteral with DATADIR (otherwise, some compilers might get confused).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 11:47:41 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added the missing disabled state of dials.
- Since HDPI is supported by KDE's blur effect with Qt ≥ 5.12, disable Kvantum's workaround for those versions.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 16 03:24:42 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Removed redundant computations after showing a menu. Their results are remembered instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 12 00:23:34 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Don't force bold or italic font on combo or menu-item texts (because finding longest texts of combos isn't CPU-friendly and combos can have menu popups).
- Ignore window frame with dragging (less calculation for Qt and no jump under Enlightenment).
- Set QStyle's standard palette to the Kvantum theme palette and make use of it instead of app palette (because app palette may not be reliable with some apps, like Qt Designer).
- An effective way of finding menus that aren't drawn by kvantum before showing them (for not moving them to compensate for their shadows, which don't exist). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  3 23:08:50 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added a key for removing Kvantum shadows from composited menus and tooltips (under DEs that give them shadow).
- Fill opaque combo menus with the window color (because transparency is enforced on combo menus while polishing them).
- When spreading menuitems across menus, do it for non-composited menus too.
- Always integrate the drop-down part of a combo box if it's drawn as a lineedit.
- Keep (partial) frame expansion as far as possible (previously, it was removed in all special cases).
- Remember whether some elements exist in the SVG file, instead of searching for them again and again.
- Imported QCommonStyle's combo width calculation (with no change in the final result).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 02:11:49 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Don't enforce window size grip with fixed size layouts. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 22:23:53 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- No separator between toggled and pressed grouped toolbuttons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 23 23:08:30 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

-Version 0.11.0

- Don't rotate the toolbar handle on vertical toolbars if it's centered- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 21 01:32:44 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Changed the drag cursor from drag-move to open-hand.
- Don't draw title-bar icons on subwindow menu if there isn't enough contrast.
- Always integrate the drop-down part of a tool button (not only when it has frame expansion).
- Fixed the text alignment of QCommandLinkButton and added a workaround for the color Qt gave to its text. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 06:40:42 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Also check the active action of active popup when determining whether a submenu is going to be shown.
- Added a key for drawing the spinbox separator also with inline indicators.
- Changed KvGnome for it to match the latest default GTK+ theme. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 22 05:42:16 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Don't move a menu that isn't drawn by kvantum (when a menu is drawn by a stylesheet, Qt lets QStyle polish it; hence the problem).
- Reversed the above-mentioned workaround for now because, unfortunately, Qt doesn't provide a reliable way of distinguishing stylesheet menus at the moment they're shown.
- Don't move detached menus when they're shown.
- Support LibreOffice's new Qt5 skin (that's much better than the old Qt4 skin). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 10 23:04:46 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

-Version 0.10.10

- Don't move a menu that isn't drawn by kvantum (when a menu is drawn by a stylesheet, Qt lets QStyle polish it; hence the problem).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 10 23:04:19 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Don't move a menu twice to compensate for its shadow width (it happens with LXQt main menu after a style change).
- Dropped QDesktopWidget.
- No redundant space for groupboxes without text/checkbox.
- Left mouse button sets slider position (middle button was a bad default).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  9 00:58:45 UTC 2019 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Use QStringLiteral when appropriate.
- When blurring backgrounds of unusual tooltips, don't exclude the tooltip shadow width if they inherit QFrame.
- Check the widget mask in BlurHelper too and disable blurring if it isn't the widget rectangle. The reason is that the mask can be set after polishing.
- Align texts vertically centered when they aren't drawn by Kvantum directly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 11 05:14:31 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Fixed a mistake in calculating combo box widths (the existence of icons wasn't considered correctly).
- Enforce the menu-item text color on font combo popups when needed.
- Fixed drawing of buttonless spin-boxes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  5 02:03:22 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Added SVG symbolic icons to Kvantum Manager because the system symbolic icons didn't change their color when the theme was changed from light to dark or conversely.
- 3-px margin for centered toolbar handles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 29 01:40:05 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Support the KDE contrast effect with Qt ≥ 5.11 for windows that support the blur effect (the KDE blur effect itself can be disabled).
- Make libfm-qt's path buttons follow group_toolbar_buttons.
- Consider active_tab_overlap in drawing tab-bar frames (because the active tab interior should be opaque when there's an overlap).
- Don't give too much space to text shadows.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 04:57:27 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Made big menus scrollable by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 16 00:58:39 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Animation for tab close buttons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 04:58:07 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Depend on KWindowSystem (KWindowEffects) with Qt >= 5.11 to support the blur effect under Wayland too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 15 00:33:49 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Support non-integer scale factors with HDPI.
- If the current theme is customized, go to its root version after it's removed by Kvantum Manager.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  4 22:26:51 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- No toggled state for progress bars.
- Made the X11 drag independent of X11 by using the QWindow method "setFramePosition()". The reason was a new bug in X11 codes of Qt5.11, which had damaged the X11 drag.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 26 02:17:21 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Fixed an old bug in text shadows.
- Added a key for spreading menuitems across left and right menu frames.
- Added KvMojave. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a flaw in size calculations related to thin progressbars.
- Take care of thin progressbars with an expanding vertical policy.
- KvYaru is added and KvCommunitheme is removed.

- Fixed QToolBox with HDPI.
- Don't let the text of an ordinary progressbar intersect its frame.
- Don't draw the left or right frame of a toolbar that is attached to the menubar but doesn't have the same width.
- Don't remove the frame expansion of view-items only because they are grouped together.
- Don't make windows translucent or blurry if they have partial masks.
- Fixed toolbar/menubar extension arrows with HDPI.
- Fixed a bug that prevented active tab overlapping when tab separators existed but "no_active_tab_separator" was "true".
- Added the key "center_scrollbar_indicator" for having a scrollbar-slider grip with the same width and height.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 12 02:18:40 UTC 2018 - Konstantin Voinov <kill_it@mail.ru>

- Version 0.10.9

- Style the split view of pcmanfm-qt appropriately when its view is transparent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 14 06:40:25 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Fill the menu interior with the window background color if there isn't an interior SVG element.
- Gave meaning to min_height/min_width under Window and Dialog sections by making them the minimum height/width of the background (interior) SVG element (useful with gradients).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 08:54:24 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- When searching for a stylable toolbar container, search only in the direct children of the widget's window.
- Find exact heights of multi-line texts for all kinds of fonts by finding their bounding rectangles and without resorting to any "magic constant".
- Added the key "spread_header" for making simple headers. Also, RTL headers are fixed.
- Added "inactive.alt.base.color" because alternate rows are drawn by Kvantum now.
- Corrected RTL for QToolBox (a bug in QCommonStyle).
- Consider inactiveness in setting scrollbar background.
- If a combo isn't styled by Kvantum anymore, don't restore its item delegate (otherwise, a rare crash might happen).
- Fixed the header icon position with RTL layouts.
- Merge the background of a header with that of its parent view, if any.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  1 01:38:10 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 19 03:10:35 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Added a key (to Kvantum manager) for ignoring the inactive state.
- For an exact vertical centering, give an even height to the bounding rectangle of the text and the icon beside it.
- Consider special fonts for menu-items (some apps may use them to show different things).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 02:31:35 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Optional sections for line-edits and combo-boxes inside toolbars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 24 08:05:56 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Cover a very rare case, where the special text of a spinbox is set when its value is minimum (which means a bad code).
- Center menubar-item texts horizontally (they were left-aligned before).
- Added a workaround for an old Qt bug which, sometimes, prevents updating of inactive widgets when the active and inactive highlight colors are the same.
- Handle multi-line combo-box menu-items by drawing them on a single line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 12 07:59:08 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Version 0.10.7

- Removed the workaround for Gwenview's scrollbar issue because it was potentially dangerous (actually, just in one case). Anyhow, Gwenview's bug was fixed a long time ago.- 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 00:07:04 UTC 2018 - kill_it@mail.ru

- Optionally separate checkboxes in view-items.

- Fixed a miscalculation when the text has shadow.
- Took care of buttonless spinboxes.
- Don't move the cursor out of the window and back for x11 dragging with Qt5. This workaround not only isn't needed anymore but also creates artifacts with Openbox.

- Version 0.8.23
- Added two new sections for opaque and translucent dialogs. The fallbacks are the sections "WindowTranslucent" and "Window".
- Added KF5 system and user color scheme paths to "style.pro" and "KvantumManager.cpp", respectively. The system path is used with the Qt5 compilation.
- Added a hacking key for removing the icons of pushbuttons as far as possible.
- Another hacking key for removing menu icons.
- A lot of subtle changes that together guarantee a more logical look under unusual circumstances.
- Corrected some miscalculations.
- When calculating spinbox size, consider the case where only QAbstractSpinBox is subclassed.
- Fixed a compilation error with Qt5-5.5.0.
- Took care of textless menuitems.
- Forced KCalcDisplay's text color.
- Let the size grip be just an indicator and added one to the default theme.
- Draw the size grip relative to the corner.
- Don't allow windows to have custom background colors if they have different window and base colors. As for their text color, it's the responsibility of developers to use QStyle correctly.
- Another criterion for giving shadow/translucency to menus.
- Changed the toggled and pressed buttons of the default theme.
- To get the spinbox maximum-length text, use the real width of the text, not the number of its characters.

- Version 0.8.22
- Added an experimental hacking key to force size grips of dialogs and statusbars.
- Partially rounded view-items (in some places) and headers.
- How did I forget namespace in such a program?!
- Take care of transparent line-edits in comboboxes (I've seen them only in Qt5 Cantata).
- Added a key for the minimum scrollbar extent and gave a 1px space to scrollbars of very thin widgets.
- Set lower/upper limits for some integer keys.
- If "mirror_doc_tabs" is false, don't mirror tabs when "attach_active_tab" is also false.

- Version 0.8.21
- If the interior element of the "expand-" objects exists, make borders rounded even when the widget height is greater than the value of frame expansion.
- Now it's possible to have clean borders with maximally rounded corners (without a new key and when the "border-" elements exist).
- Added a configuration section for distinguishing between opaque and translucent window backgrounds if needed.
- Added a key for not mirroring the top/left tab shape to draw the bottom/right tab in the document mode.
- Set the pressed state for a combobox if its line-edit has focus.
- Compile kvantumpreview and kventummanager against Qt5 by default.
- Workaround for the nasty behavior of Qt5 QSettings, which reorders keys on writing.
- A little more space for centered toolbar handles.
- Added a hacking key to force size grips of dialogs and statusbars.
