- Update to version 0.6.0:
  The Kargo team is thrilled to announce the release of v0.6.0,
  packed with stability improvements, enhancements, and new
  features. While the list of improvements and additions is
  extensive, we have highlighted some features you can look forward
  to exploring.
  If you are looking for a more complete list, please do consult
  the full changelog
  https://github.com/akuity/kargo/compare/v0.5.2...v0.6.0
  * Notes on Upgrading
    There is a single breaking change: the "well-known"
    kargo-secret-manager ClusterRole has been renamed to
    kargo-project-admin. However, this release includes a built-in
    upgrade reconciler to ensure a seamless upgrade process by
    automatically changing any project-level bindings referencing
    the old name to reference the new one.
    Please note that if you are upgrading from a version older than
    v0.5.0, you first need to upgrade to v0.5.x before upgrading to
    v0.6.0. This is due to breaking changes introduced in v0.5.0,
    for which no upgrade aid exists in this release.
  * Role Management
    Kargo will now create two roles in every Project: kargo-admin
    and kargo-viewer.
    The Kargo UI and CLI further allow creating and managing
    additional roles to provide scoped access to Kargo resources in
    a Project, which can be mapped to OIDC emails, subjects, and
    groups.
  * Warehouse Filters
    In v0.5.0, Warehouse subscription filters using regular
    expressions were introduced. Making it possible to, for
    instance, subscribe to a monorepo, but trigger the production
    of new Freight only when changes to relevant paths are
    detected.
    In this release, this feature has been further enhanced to
    support glob patterns (using a glob: prefix) and exact paths to
    files or directories. Additionally, the filters now apply to
    all commit selection strategies (and not just
    NewestFromBranch).
    For more detailed information, please take a look at the Kargo
    documentation.
  * Kubernetes Events
    Kargo will now emit Kubernetes Events for noteworthy changes.
    For example, when a new Promotion is created or the
    verification of Freight in a Stage succeeded. These events can
    also be viewed in the newly introduced events tab in the
    Project dashboard of the Kargo UI.
  * GitLab Merge Requests
    In v0.3.0, support for opening a GitHub pull request was added
    to Git-based promotion mechanisms. With the help of
    @PhilippParis, this has now been expanded to support GitLab
    merge requests.
  * UI Improvements
    - Project settings and AnalysisTemplate resources can now be
      managed through the UI.
    - Variety of bug fixes and other stability improvements.
  * Other Notable Features
    - Credentials can now include descriptions, which are displayed
      in the UI for informational purposes. We plan to expand this
      feature to more Kargo resource types in the future.
    - kargo get commands now support a --no-headers flag, which
      will avoid printing the column headers when provided.
    - kargo promote can now wait for a Promotion to finish using
      --wait.
    - Kargo can now be configured (via the chart configuration) to
      sign commits with a GPG key.
    - Arbitrary volumes can be mounted to the optional Dex server
      (via the chart configuration) to support more complex
      connector configurations. This can for example be useful to
      configure Dex's google connector to get additional Google
      Groups information from your users, allowing you to assign
      permissions to members of a Google Group.

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  Big update with breaking changes, see release notes at
  https://github.com/akuity/kargo/releases/tag/v0.5.0
  * All New CLI
    Breaking Change
    - The CLI has been virtually rewritten from the ground up. Up
      until now it wasn't an area of the project that had received
      the attention it deserved and we knew its UX needed quite a
      bit of work. All that has changed with this release!
    - The updated CLI should feel more intuitive across the board,
      behavior and help text should be more consistent from one
      command to the next, and we've added quite a bit of new
      functionality as well. Especially notable is that credentials
      can now be managed and verification processes re-run or even
      aborted via CLI.
    - If you upgrade Kargo's cluster-side components, you must also
      upgrade the CLI (if you use it).
