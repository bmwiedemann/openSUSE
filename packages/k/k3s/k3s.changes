- Update to upstream version 1.20.4+k3s1
  * Known Issues
    - K3s servers should always be upgraded before agents. Agents upgraded to
      this release before all servers have been upgraded will fail to start due to
      the issue described at #2996
  * Changes since v1.20.2+k3s2:
    + Upgrade Kubernetes to v1.20.4 (#2960)
    + K3s servers now use appropriate HTTP response codes to node join failures
      caused by incorrect credentials (#2915)
    + ServiceLB now adds IP addresses for all nodes running LB pods to the
      Service ingress IP list (#2909)
    + K3s will now reliably enable CFS quotas when the cpu and cpuacct cgroup
      controllers are comounted (#2911)
    + K3s nodes can now successfully join clusters when the cluster CA
      certificate is trusted by the OS CA bundle (#2743)
    + K3s binary size has been reduced; time to first launch a new version of
      K3s should be reduced as well (#2905)
    + K3s is now compiled with golang 1.15.8, resolving a common source of
      crashes on 32bit arm systems (#2896)
    + Crictl will more reliably locate its config file when run by non-root users (#2894)
    + The K3s systemd unit will successfully start with a missing
      EnvironmentFile (#2886 @AkihiroSuda)
    + The K3s Network Policy Controller has been updated, offering improved
      performance and reliability of network policy enforcement (#2867)
    + K3s containerd now supports AppArmor signal mediation (#2877)
    + The K3s embedded userspace (k3s-root) has been updated to fix several
      BusyBox CVEs and allow use of the fuse-overlayfs snapshotter (#2862 #2847)
    + K3s now supports cgroupv2 (#2844)
    + Several regressions in rootless support have been resolved (#2846)
    + Cadvisor statistics are no longer missing pod labels (#2836)
    + Embedded etcd's Prometheus metrics can now be exposed beyond localhost (#2750 @yuriydzobak)
    + The node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint on new nodes is
      now cleared more reliably (#2843)
    + Embedded etc snapshots can now be performed on-demand (#2819)
    + K3s no longer validates containerd snapshotter functionality when not
      using the embedded containerd (#2800 @sonicaj)

- Update to version 0.4.0
  * Features and Enhancements
    - Update to kubernetes v1.14.1 - Upgraded from Kubernetes
      v1.13.5.
      This Kubernetes upgrade moves pid limiting to beta and is
      enabled by default, which may not be supported by all kernels.
      K3s will auto-detect cgroup pids support and add flags as
      needed if the pids module is not available. [#335]
    - Add --bind-address flag for API server [#214]
      Support custom bind address for kubernetes API server to bind to.
    - Add --cluster-domain flag for custom kubelet and DNS configuration [#267]
      Support configuring custom DNS cluster domains.
    - Add --flannel-iface flag for agent [#72]
      Support custom flannel interface.
    - Add passthrough args [#290]
      Support for overriding k3s default arguments or passing custom
      arguments to Kubernetes processes:
      --kube-apiserver-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-apiserver process
      --kube-scheduler-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-scheduler process
      --kube-controller-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-controller-manager process
      --kubelet-arg value
        (agent) Customized flag for kubelet process
      --kube-proxy-arg value
        (agent) Customized flag for kube-proxy process
    - Initial metrics-server support [#252]
      Configures aggregation layer so metrics server can be launched and
      metrics scraped. Future enhancements will remove need for a
      custom metrics server deployment.
    - Add experimental rootless support
      Provides --rootless flag for running k3s agent as a user.
  * Bug fixes
    - Fixed an issue where k3s may not connect to the API server when using
      proxy settings [#325]
- Changes from Release v0.3.0
  * Features and Enhancements
    - Airgap support with helm and preinstalled images [#166]

      (Google Public DNS).

- Replace the sales pitch in the description by new wording,
  sourced from second block paragraph of k3s's README.md and
  Wikipedia, so as to fulfill the openSUSE description
  recommendations on what k3s is, and how it differs from other
  implementations of its kind.
