- Update to version 0.4.0
  * Features and Enhancements
    - Update to kubernetes v1.14.1 - Upgraded from Kubernetes
      v1.13.5.
      This Kubernetes upgrade moves pid limiting to beta and is
      enabled by default, which may not be supported by all kernels.
      K3s will auto-detect cgroup pids support and add flags as
      needed if the pids module is not available. [#335]
    - Add --bind-address flag for API server [#214]
      Support custom bind address for kubernetes API server to bind to.
    - Add --cluster-domain flag for custom kubelet and DNS configuration [#267]
      Support configuring custom DNS cluster domains.
    - Add --flannel-iface flag for agent [#72]
      Support custom flannel interface.
    - Add passthrough args [#290]
      Support for overriding k3s default arguments or passing custom
      arguments to Kubernetes processes:
      --kube-apiserver-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-apiserver process
      --kube-scheduler-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-scheduler process
      --kube-controller-arg value
        Customized flag for kube-controller-manager process
      --kubelet-arg value
        (agent) Customized flag for kubelet process
      --kube-proxy-arg value
        (agent) Customized flag for kube-proxy process
    - Initial metrics-server support [#252]
      Configures aggregation layer so metrics server can be launched and
      metrics scraped. Future enhancements will remove need for a
      custom metrics server deployment.
    - Add experimental rootless support
      Provides --rootless flag for running k3s agent as a user.
  * Bug fixes
    - Fixed an issue where k3s may not connect to the API server when using
      proxy settings [#325]
- Changes from Release v0.3.0
  * Features and Enhancements
    - Airgap support with helm and preinstalled images [#166]
      Support static helm charts through the API server and loading
      container images on agents. See our documentation for details
      on how to perform airgap installations.
    - Add --tls-san flag for API server cert validation [#200]
      Support alternate names for cert generation to avoid API cert issues.
    - Add --resolv-conf flag for custom kubelet DNS configuration [#53]
    - Support configuring custom DNS resolvers or using the host system's
      resolv.conf configuration. If the host system's resolv.conf doesn't
      supply any viable resolvers, intelligently fallback to 8.8.8.8
      (Google Public DNS).
    - Update to kubernetes v1.13.5
      This upgrade from v1.13.4 addresses Kubernetes CVE-2019-9946
      and CVE-2019-1002101.

      if the port name is longer than 15 characters #90
    - Fixed an issue where k3s does not ignore empty yaml documents in a
      manfest #222
    - Fixed an issue where k3s may not run with selinux, the installer will now

    - Fixed an issue where k3s deployment manifests are created even if
      --no-deploy is specified #230

Fri Mar 15 18:57:35 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Replace the sales pitch in the description by new wording,
  sourced from second block paragraph of k3s's README.md and
  Wikipedia, so as to fulfill the openSUSE description
  recommendations on what k3s is, and how it differs from other
  implementations of its kind.
