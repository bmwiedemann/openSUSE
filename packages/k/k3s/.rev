    <comment>- Replace the sales pitch in the description by new wording,
  sourced from second block paragraph of k3s's README.md and
  Wikipedia, so as to fulfill the openSUSE description
  recommendations on what k3s is, and how it differs from other
  implementations of its kind.
- Fix 'Conflicts'
- Add 'iptables' requires
- Package hyperkube sepraretly
- Add a workaround for https://github.com/rancher/k3s/issues/231
- Add kubectl and crictl symlinks
- Update description
- Add requires to 'conntrack-tools' and 'runc' as it is needed at
  runtime
- Fix k3s-agent.service as '-u' is not a valid option
- Update to version 0.2.0:
  * Features and Enhancements:
    - Support arbitrary CRI implementations [#107] - Users can now 
    configure k3s to use cri-o and other CRI implementations that 
    are not packaged into k3s.
    - Support for preloading images [#92] - Users can now have node
    agents load docker images from a location on the host at startup,
    eliminating the need to pull images from a remote location.
    - Upgrade to Kubernetes v1.13.4 [#95] - Update to the latest 
    release of Kubernetes.
    - Support k3s on Rancher [#69] - Users can now import k3s 
    clusters into Rancher (supported in Rancher v2.2.0-rc3 and later).
    - Support agent options in server command [#73] - Users can now
    set any of the options available to agents when starting the k3s
    server node.
    - Support the ability to run k3s as non-root user [#38] - User 
    can now run the k3s server as a non-root user.
    - Support the ability to read node token from a file [#98] - Users
    can now have the node-agent read its token from a file rather
    than passing it as a string.

    deploy if no namespace is specified #151

    values.yaml aren't always triggering an upgrade #187
