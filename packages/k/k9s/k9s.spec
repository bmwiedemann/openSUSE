%description
K9s provides a curses based terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes
clusters. The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe
and manage your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with observed
Kubernetes resources.
