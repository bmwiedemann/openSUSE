- Update to version 2.6.0
  * New command: "kew albums", similar to "kew all" but it queues
    one album randomly after the other. Thank you @the-boar for the
    suggestion.
  * Fixed bug where sometimes kew couldn't find a suitable name for
    a playlist file (created by pressing x).
  * Made it so that seeking jumps in more reasonable smaller
    increments when not in song view. Previously it could jump 30
    seconds at a time.
  * Rolled back code related to symlinked directories, it didn't
    work with freebsd, possibly others.
- Add clang BuildRequires: build for leap

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 2.5.1
  * Fixed bug where desktop notifications could lead to a short
    stall of the app at startup if notify-send wasn't installed.
  * Search: Removed duplicate search result name variable. This
    means search results will now have a very low memory footprint.
  * Symlinked directories should work better now. Works best if 
    the symlink and the destination directory has the same name.

- Update to version 2.5.0
  * Fuzzy search! Press F5 to search your library.
  * You can now quit with Esc. Handy when you are in search view,
    because pressing 'q' will just add that letter to the search
    string.
  * Fixed issue where after completing a playthrough of a playlist
    and then starting over, only the first song would be played.
  * Fine tuning of the spectrum visualizer. Still not perfect but
    I think this one is better. I might be wrong though.
  * Made scrolling quicker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

   * Improved album cover color mode. Press 'i' to try this.
   * To accelerate startup times, there is now a library cache.
     This feature is optional and can be enabled in the settings
     file (kewrc). If the library loading process is slow, you'll
     be prompted to consider using the cache.
   * You can now press 'u' to update the library in case you've
     added or removed songs.
   * Faster "kew all". It now bases its playlist on the library
     instead of scanning everything a second time.
   * Fixed when running the special playlist with "kew .", the app
     sometimes became unresponsive when adding / deleting.

- Update to version 2.2
  * This update mostly contains improvements to stability.
  * M4a file decoding is no longer done by calling ffmpeg
    externally, it's (finally) done like the other file formats.
    This should make kew more stable, responsive and it should
    consume less memory when playing m4a files.
  * kew now starts the first time with your system volume as the
    volume, after that it remembers the last volume it exited with
    and uses that.
  * kew now picks up and starts using the cover color without the
    user having to first go to track view.

    albums have a similar name, and you want to specify you want
    one or the other. Example: kew -e basement popstar.

    track view.
