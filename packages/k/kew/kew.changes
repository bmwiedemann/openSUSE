- Update to version 2.7.0
  * Proper MPRIS and PlayerCtl support. Set volume, stop, seek and
    others now work as expected. You can also switch tracks while
    stopped or paused now. Everything should work except openUri
    and repeat playlist which are not available for now.
  * New (optional) dependency: Libnotify. In practice, adding
    libnotify as a dependency means browsing through music will no
    longer make desktop notifications pile up, instead the one
    visible will update itself. This looks much better. kew uses
    libnotify only if you have it installed, so it should if
    possible be an optional thing during installation.
  * Allows binding of other keys for the different ui views that
    you get with F2-F6.
  * Removed the option to toggle covers on and off by pressing 'c'.
  * Removed build warning on systems with ffmpeg 4.4 installed.
  * Only run one instance of kew at a time, thanks @werdahias for
    the suggestion.
  * If you exit the kew with 0% volume, when you open it next time,
    volume will be at 10%. To avoid confusion.
  * Handle SIGHUP not only SIGINT.
  * Prints error message instead of crashing on Fedora when
    playing unsupported .m4a files. This problem is related to
    ffmpeg free/non-free versions. You need the non-free version.
  * Fixed issue where special characters in the song title could
    cause mpris widgets to not work correctly.
- add libnotify-devel BuildRequires: needed for v2.7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  6 09:53:39 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.6.0
  * New command: "kew albums", similar to "kew all" but it queues
    one album randomly after the other. Thank you @the-boar for the
    suggestion.
  * Fixed bug where sometimes kew couldn't find a suitable name for
    a playlist file (created by pressing x).
  * Made it so that seeking jumps in more reasonable smaller
    increments when not in song view. Previously it could jump 30
    seconds at a time.
  * Rolled back code related to symlinked directories, it didn't
    work with freebsd, possibly others.
- Add clang BuildRequires: build for leap

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  2 11:23:54 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.5.1
  * Fixed bug where desktop notifications could lead to a short
    stall of the app at startup if notify-send wasn't installed.
  * Search: Removed duplicate search result name variable. This
    means search results will now have a very low memory footprint.
  * Symlinked directories should work better now. Works best if 
    the symlink and the destination directory has the same name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 17 04:46:18 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.5.0
  * Fuzzy search! Press F5 to search your library.
  * You can now quit with Esc. Handy when you are in search view,
    because pressing 'q' will just add that letter to the search
    string.
  * Fixed issue where after completing a playthrough of a playlist
    and then starting over, only the first song would be played.
  * Fine tuning of the spectrum visualizer. Still not perfect but
    I think this one is better. I might be wrong though.
  * Made scrolling quicker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 27 03:33:29 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.4.4
  * Fixed no sound when playing a flac or mp3 song twice, then
    enqueuing another.
  * Don't save every change to the playlist when running the
    special playlist w*ith 'kew .', only add the songs added by
    pressing '.'.
  * Removed a compiler warning and a few other minor fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 10:40:54 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.4.1
   * Improved album cover color mode. Press 'i' to try this.
   * To accelerate startup times, there is now a library cache.
     This feature is optional and can be enabled in the settings
     file (kewrc). If the library loading process is slow, you'll
     be prompted to consider using the cache.
   * You can now press 'u' to update the library in case you've
     added or removed songs.
   * Faster "kew all". It now bases its playlist on the library
     instead of scanning everything a second time.
   * Fixed when running the special playlist with "kew .", the app
     sometimes became unresponsive when adding / deleting.
   * Code refactoring and cleanup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

   * New settings: configurable colors. These are configured in the
     kewrc file (in ~/.config/ or wherever your config files are)
     with instructions there.
   * New setting: hidehelp. Hides the help text on library view
     and playlist view.
   * New setting: hidelogo. Prints the artist name as well as the
     song title at the top instead of a logo.

   * Fixed an issue where it could crash at the end of the
     playlist.

     all formats.
   * Proper clean up and restore cursor when using CTRL-C to quit
     the app.

     song.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  3 07:17:31 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 2.2
  * This update mostly contains improvements to stability.
  * M4a file decoding is no longer done by calling ffmpeg
    externally, it's (finally) done like the other file formats.
    This should make kew more stable, responsive and it should
    consume less memory when playing m4a files.
  * kew now starts the first time with your system volume as the
    volume, after that it remembers the last volume it exited with
    and uses that.
  * kew now picks up and starts using the cover color without the
    user having to first go to track view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 2.0.4
  * You can now add "-e" or "--exact" in your searches to return an
    exact (not case sensitive) match. This can be helpful when two
    albums have a similar name, and you want to specify you want
    one or the other. Example: kew -e basement popstar.
  * Fixed issue where pressing del on the playlist changed view to
    track view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 15 06:45:39 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

    From there you can add songs to the playlist.

  * You can flip through pages of the library or playlist by
    pressing Page Up and Page Down.

    type "kew all" in the terminal.

    behavior of exiting when finished.

    coupled with the new features of being able to remove and add

    playlist views.
