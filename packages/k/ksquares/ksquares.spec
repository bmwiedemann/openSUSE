%description
KSquares is an implementation of the popular paper-based game
squares, better known as "La Pipopipette" in its original French
form, or "Dots and Boxes" in English. One must draw lines to complete
squares, and the player with the most squares wins. This
implementation can be played with up to 4 players, any number of
which may be controlled by the computer.
