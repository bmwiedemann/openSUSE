  <title>Advanced configuration system</title>
  <description>KConfig provides an advanced configuration system. It is made of three parts:
KConfigCore, KConfigGui and KConfigQml.

KConfigCore provides access to the configuration files themselves. It features:

- centralized definition: define your configuration in an XML file and use
`kconfig_compiler` to generate classes to read and write configuration entries.

- lock-down (kiosk) support.

KConfigGui provides a way to hook widgets to the configuration so that they are
automatically initialized from the configuration and automatically propagate
their changes to their respective configuration files.

KConfigQml provides QtQuick bindings to KConfig, allowing it to be used with QML.
