Subject: [PATCH 2/2] KUrlCompletion: accommodate ":local" protocols that use
 hostname in url

An example of that is kdeconnect://, offering completions for it is
redundant since it uses the hostname part of the url as the deviceId (a
sequence of letters and numbers that's not easy to remember), so can't use
that, and the UDS_NAME is the pretty name (e.g. SM-J500H) users see listed in
kdeconnect:// but kdeconnect://SM-J500H doesn't work. Also because the code in
KUrlCompletion::_k_slotEntries() is expecting a list of files/dirs to offer
as completions, and not hostnames (_k_slotEntries uses addPathtoUrl helper
method), no useful completions are feasible.

Instead if the "filename" part of the url is empty we just skip it.

Note that this prevents the code from hitting an assert in addPathToUrl
(after applying https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kio/-/merge_requests/127
which is needed to make accessing devices using the kdeconnect ioslave
actually work at all).
