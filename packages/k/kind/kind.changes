- Update to version 0.31.0:
  https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.31.0
  * Breaking Changes
    - The default node image is now kindest/node:v1.35.0@sha256:452d707d4862f52530247495d180205e029056831160e22870e37e3f6c1ac31f
  * Kubernetes 1.35+ Cgroup v1
    Kubernetes will be removing cgroup v1 support, and therefore
    kind node images at those versions will also be dropping
    support.
    You can read more about this change in the Kubernetes release
    blog:
    https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernetes-v1-35-release/#removal-of-cgroup-v1-support
    If you must use kind on cgroup v1, we recommend using an older
    Kubernetes release for the immediate future, but we also
    strongly recommend migrating to cgroup v2.
    In the near future as Kubernetes support dwindles, KIND will
    also clean up cgroup v1 workarounds and drop support in future
    kind releases and images, regardless of Kubernetes version.
    Most stable linux distros should be on cgroupv2 out of the box.
    This is a reminder to use pinned images by digest, see the note
    below about images for this release.
  * Kubeadm Config *Future* Breaking Change
    WARNING: Future kind releases will adopt kubeadm v1beta4
    configuration, kubeadm v1beta4 has a breaking change to
    extraArgs:
    https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/23/kubernetes-1-31-kubeadm-v1beta4/.
    If you use the kubeadmConfigPatches feature then you may need
    to prepare for this change.
    We recommend that you use versioned config patches that
    explicitly match the version required.
    KIND uses kubeadm v1beta3 for Kubernetes 1.23+, and will likely
    use v1beta4 for Kubernetes 1.36+
    The exact version is TBD pending work to fix this but expected
    to be 1.36.
    It will definitely be an as-of-yet-unreleased Kubernetes
    version to avoid surprises, and it will not be on a
    patch-release boundary.
    KIND may still work with older Kubernetes versions at v1beta2,
    but we no longer test or actively support these as Kubernetes
    only supports 1.32+ currently: https://kubernetes.io/releases/
    You likely only need v1beta3 + v1beta4 patches, you can take
    your existing patches that work with v1beta3, explicitly set
    apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3 in the patch at the top
    level, and make another copy for v1beta4. The v1beta4 patch
    will need to move extraArgs from a map to a list, for examples
    see:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/

    For a concrete example of kind config with kubeadm config patch
    targeting both v1beta3 and v1beta4, consider this simple kind
    config that sets verbosity of the apiserver logs:

      kind: Cluster
      apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
      kubeadmConfigPatches:
      # patch for v1beta3 (1.23 ...)
      - |
        kind: ClusterConfiguration
        apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
        apiServer:
          extraArgs:
            "v": "4"
      # patch for v1beta4 (future)
      - |
        kind: ClusterConfiguration
        apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
        apiServer:
          extraArgs:
            - name: "v"
              value: "4"

    If you only need to target a particular release, you can use
    one version.
    If you only need to target fields that did not change between
    kubeadm beta versions, you can use a versionless patch, which
    may be more convenient, but we cannot guarantee there will be
    no future kubeadm config breaking changes.

Tue May 14 05:22:44 UTC 2024 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 0.23.0:
  This release introduces initial limited support for nerdctl and
  kube-proxy nftables mode.
  * Breaking Changes
    - The default node image is now Kubernetes 1.30.0:
      kindest/node:v1.30.0@sha256:047357ac0cfea04663786a612ba1eaba9702bef25227a794b52890dd8bcd692e
    - ipFamily config field is now validated
      - While technically a breaking change, if the value you set
        here is now caught as invalid it was being silently ignored
        and creating an ipv4 cluster previously and you should
        correct your config
    - Go 1.17+ is required for go install sigs.k8s.io/kind /
      building the kind binary
      - Prebuilt binaries are available as an alternative to go
        install
      - For local development make will automatically setup the
        correct go version
      - Note that the go team only supports 1.21+ and major linux
        distros have 1.19+
      - Future releases may increase this to a more current Go
        release
      - Future release may adopt toolchain in go.mod to make this
        seamless if you have go 1.21+ installed even without our
        makefile. We highly recommend installing go 1.21+
  * New Features
    - Initial support for nodes created with nerdctl
    - Initial support for kubeProxyMode: nftables (ahead of
      Kubernetes 1.31+, see
      https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode)
    - Sweeping dependency updates, see commits for full details.
