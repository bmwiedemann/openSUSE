    <comment>- Update to 0.14.6:
  * Fix a regression in the previous release that caused kitty to
    not always respond to DPI changes (#1999)
- Changes from 0.14.5:
  * Implement a hack to (mostly) preserve tabs when cat-ting a
    file with them and then copying the text or passing screen
    contents to another program (#1829)
  * When all visible windows have the same background color, use
    that as the color for the global padding, instead of the
    configured background color (#1957)
  * When resetting the terminal, also reset parser state, this
    allows easy recovery from incomplete escape codes (#1961)

  * Fix incorrect rendering of some symbols when followed by a
    space while using the PowerLine font which does not have a
    space glyph (#1225)

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.15.0:
  * Add a new action detach_window that can be used to move the current window
    into a different tab (#1310)
  * Add a new action launch that unifies launching of processes in new kitty
    windows/tabs.
  * Add a new style powerline for tab bar rendering, see tab_bar_style (#2021)
  * Allow changing colors by mapping a keyboard shortcut to read a kitty config
    file with color definitions. See the FAQ for details (#2083)
  * hints kitten: Allow completely customizing the matching and actions
    performed by the kitten using your own script (#2124)
  * Wayland: Fix key repeat not being stopped when focus leaves window. This is
    expected behavior on Wayland, apparently (#2014)
  * When drawing unicode symbols that are followed by spaces, use multiple
    cells to avoid resized or cut-off glyphs (#1452)
  * diff kitten: Allow diffing remote files easily via ssh (#727)
  * unicode input kitten: Add an option kitty +kitten unicode_input
    --emoji-variation to control the presentation variant of selected emojis
    (#2139)
  * Add specialised rendering for a few more box powerline and unicode symbols
    (#2074 and #2021)
  * Add a new socket only mode for allow_remote_control. This makes it possible
    for programs running on the local machine to control kitty but not programs
    running over ssh.
  * hints kitten: Allow using named groups in the regular expression. The named
    groups are passed to the invoked program for further processing.
  * Fix a regression in 0.14.5 that caused rendering of private use glyphs with
    and without spaces to be identical (#2117)
  * Wayland: Fix incorrect scale used when first creating an OS window (#2133)</comment>
