    not always respond to DPI changes (#1999)

    file with them and then copying the text or passing screen
    contents to another program (#1829)
  * When all visible windows have the same background color, use
    that as the color for the global padding, instead of the

    allows easy recovery from incomplete escape codes (#1961)

    into a different tab (#1310)
  * Add a new action launch that unifies launching of processes in new kitty
    windows/tabs.
  * Add a new style powerline for tab bar rendering, see tab_bar_style (#2021)
  * Allow changing colors by mapping a keyboard shortcut to read a kitty config
    file with color definitions. See the FAQ for details (#2083)
  * hints kitten: Allow completely customizing the matching and actions
    performed by the kitten using your own script (#2124)
  * Wayland: Fix key repeat not being stopped when focus leaves window. This is
    expected behavior on Wayland, apparently (#2014)

    cells to avoid resized or cut-off glyphs (#1452)
  * diff kitten: Allow diffing remote files easily via ssh (#727)

  * Add a new socket only mode for allow_remote_control. This makes it possible

    running over ssh.
  * hints kitten: Allow using named groups in the regular expression. The named
    groups are passed to the invoked program for further processing.

    and without spaces to be identical (#2117)
  * Wayland: Fix incorrect scale used when first creating an OS window (#2133)</comment>
