  * When all visible windows have the same background color, use

    windows/tabs.
  * Add a new style powerline for tab bar rendering, see tab_bar_style (#2021)
  * Allow changing colors by mapping a keyboard shortcut to read a kitty config
    file with color definitions. See the FAQ for details (#2083)
  * hints kitten: Allow completely customizing the matching and actions
    performed by the kitten using your own script (#2124)
  * Wayland: Fix key repeat not being stopped when focus leaves window. This is
    expected behavior on Wayland, apparently (#2014)

    cells to avoid resized or cut-off glyphs (#1452)
  * diff kitten: Allow diffing remote files easily via ssh (#727)

    running over ssh.
  * hints kitten: Allow using named groups in the regular expression. The named
    groups are passed to the invoked program for further processing.

    and without spaces to be identical (#2117)
  * Wayland: Fix incorrect scale used when first creating an OS window (#2133)</comment>
