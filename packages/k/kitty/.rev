    a new window next to the active window (#1746)
  * Document the kitty remote control protocol (#1646)
  * Add a new option pointer_shape_when_grabbed that allows you to control
    the mouse pointer shape when the terminal programs grabs the pointer (#1808)
  * Add an option terminal_select_modifiers to control which modifiers are
    used to override mouse selection even when a terminal application has
    grabbed the mouse (#1774)
  * When piping data to a child in the pipe command do it in a thread so as
    not to block the UI (#1708)
  * unicode_input kitten: Fix a regression that broke using indices to select
    recently used symbols.

    focused window rather than the underlying window (#1720)

    that renders out of bounds (#1713)

    in the alternate screen mode (#1578)
  * Linux: Use the system &quot;bell&quot; sound for the terminal bell. Adds libcanberra as a
    new dependency to play the system sound.
  * Linux: Fix a regression in 0.14.0 that caused the event loop to tick continuously,
    wasting CPU even when idle (#1782)
  * ssh kitten: Make argument parsing more like ssh (#1787)
  * When using strip_trailing_spaces do not remove empty lines (#1802)
  * Fix a crash when displaying very large number of images (#1825)</comment>

    invocation for brevity and to change kitten option defaults globally (#1879)

    env var fails (#1869)
  * Disable the liga and dlig OpenType features for broken
    fonts such as Nimbus Mono.

    <comment>- Update to 0.14.6:
  * Fix a regression in the previous release that caused kitty to
    not always respond to DPI changes (#1999)
- Changes from 0.14.5:
  * Implement a hack to (mostly) preserve tabs when cat-ting a
    file with them and then copying the text or passing screen
    contents to another program (#1829)
  * When all visible windows have the same background color, use
    that as the color for the global padding, instead of the
    configured background color (#1957)
  * When resetting the terminal, also reset parser state, this
    allows easy recovery from incomplete escape codes (#1961)
  * Allow mapping keys commonly found on European keyboards (#1928)
  * Fix incorrect rendering of some symbols when followed by a
    space while using the PowerLine font which does not have a
    space glyph (#1225)
  * Linux: Allow using fonts with spacing=90 in addition to
    fonts with spacing=100 (#1968)
  * Use selection foreground color for underlines as well (#1982)</comment>
