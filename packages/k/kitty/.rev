    <comment>- i586 builds fail with -fcf-protection=full (seems to be default);
  setting to -fcf-protection=none with CFLAGS export

- Removing go-buildmode-pie.diff and optional-disable-docs.diff; replacing
  with buildmode-and-skip_docs.diff which should be an easier path going
  forward to disabling 'make docs' from setup.py
- Update to 0.32.0:
  * Conditional mappings depending on the state of the focused window
  * Support for Modal mappings such as in modal editors like vim
  * A new option notify_on_cmd_finish to show a desktop notification
    when a long running command finishes (#6817)
  * A new action send_key to simplify mapping key presses to other
    keys without needing send_text
  * Allow focusing previously active OS windows via nth_os_window (#7009)
  * Wayland: Fix a regression in the previous release that broke copying
    to clipboard under wl-roots based compositors in some circumstances (#6890)
  * macOS: Fix some combining characters not being rendered (#6898)
  * macOS: Fix returning from full screen via the button when the titlebar
    is hidden not hiding the buttons (#6883)
  * macOS: Fix newly created OS windows not always appearing on the
    &quot;active&quot; monitor (#6932)
  * Font fallback: Fix the font used to render a character sometimes dependent
    on the order in which characters appear on screen (#6865)
  * panel kitten: Fix rendering with non-zero margin/padding in
    kitty.conf (#6923)
  * kitty keyboard protocol: Specify the behavior of the modifier bits during
    modifier key events (#6913)
  * Wayland: Enable support for the new cursor-shape protocol so that the
    mouse cursor is always rendered at the correct size in compositors that
    support this protocol (#6914)</comment>
