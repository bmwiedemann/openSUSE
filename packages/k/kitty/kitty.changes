Mon Sep 10 12:06:28 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.12.1:
  * Add a new kitty --start-in-fullscreen command line flag to start kitty in full screen mode (#856)
  * Linux: Do not enable IME input via ibus unless the GLFW_IM_MODULE=ibus environment variable is set. IME causes key processing latency and even missed keystrokes for many people, so it is now off by default.
  * Fix backspacing of wide characters in wide-character unaware programs not working (#875)
  * Linux: Fix number pad arrow keys not working when Numlock is off (#857)
  * Wayland: Implement support for clipboard copy/paste (#855)
  * Allow mapping shortcuts using the raw key code from the OS (#848)
  * Allow mapping of individual key-presses without modifiers as shortcuts
  * Fix legacy invocation of icat as kitty icat not working (#850)
  * Improve rendering of wavy underline at small font sizes (#853)
  * Fix a regression in 0.12.0 that broke dynamic resizing of layouts (#860)
  * Wayland: Allow using the kitty --class command line flag to set the app id (#862)

  * Linux: Fix XCompose rules with no defined symbol not working (#880)
  * Linux: Fix crash with some Nvidia drivers when creating tabs in the first top level-window after creating a second top-level window. (#873)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 06:27:08 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.12.0:
  * Preserve the mouse selection even when the contents of the screen are scrolled or overwritten provided the new text does not intersect the selected lines.
  * Linux: Implement support for Input Method Extensions (multilingual input using standard keyboards) via IBus (#469)
  * Implement completion for the kitty command in bash and zsh. See Completion for kitty.
  * Render the text under the cursor in a fixed color, configurable via the option cursor_text_color (#126)
  * Add an option env to set environment variables in child processes from kitty.conf
  * Implement high precision scrolling with the trackpad on platforms such as macOS and Wayland that implement it. (#819)
  * Remote control: Allow changing the current window layout with a new kitty @ goto-layout command (#845)
  * Remote control: Allow matching windows by the environment variables of their child process as well
  * Allow running kittens via the remote control system (#738)
  * Allow enabling remote control in only some kitty windows
  * Add a keyboard shortcut to reset the terminal (ctrl+shift+delete). It takes parameters so you can define your own shortcuts to clear the screen/scrollback also (#747)
  * Fix one-pixel line appearing at window edges at some window sizes when displaying images with background opacity enabled (#741)
  * diff kitten: Fix error when right hand side file is binary and left hand side file is text (#752)

  * Fix detection of URLs in HTML source code (URLs inside quotes) (#785)
  * Implement support for emoji skin tone modifiers (#787)
  * Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj is still not implemented, since it can cause the collapse of an unbounded number of characters into a single cell. However, kitty at least preserves the zwj by storing it as a combining character.
  * Linux: Fix slow startup on some systems caused by GLFW searching for joysticks. Since kitty does not use joysticks, disable joystick support. (#830)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 08:53:36 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.11.3:
  * Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn. The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the draw_minimal_borders setting in kitty.conf.
  * Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled (#703)
  * When dragging to select with the mouse "grab" the mouse so that if it strays into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated (#624)

  * When drag-scrolling stop the scroll when the mouse button is released.
  * Fix a regression in the previous release that caused pasting large amounts of text to be duplicated (#709)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 09:44:23 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

  * Add a kitty --hold command line option to stay open after the child process exits (#667)
  * diff kitten: When triggering a search scroll to the first match automatically
  * kitty --debug-font-fallback also prints out what basic fonts were matched
  * When closing a kitty window reset the mouse cursor to its default shape and ensure it is visible (#655).
  * Remote control: Speed-up reading of command responses
  * Linux installer: Fix installer failing on systems with python < 3.5
  * Support “-T” as an alias for “–title” (#659)

  * Fix kitty @ set-colors --all not working when more than one window present (#632)
  * Fix a regression that broke the legacy increase/decrease_font_size actions

  * icat kitten: Add kitty +kitten icat --print-window-size to easily detect the window size in pixels from scripting languages (#581)

  * Add a "fat" layout that is similar to the "tall" layout but vertically oriented.

Sun May  6 08:18:05 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.9.1:
  * Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the
    tab and the window is not the currently focused window
  * Change the window border color if a bell occurs in an unfocused window. Can
    be disabled by setting the bell_border_color to be the same as the
    inactive_border_color.
  * Unicode input: When searching by name search for prefix matches as well as whole word matches
  * Dynamically allocate the memory used for the scrollback history buffer.
  * Reduces startup memory consumption when using very large scrollback buffer sizes.
  * Add an option to not request window attention on bell.
  * Remote control: Allow matching windows by number (visible position).
  * When triple-clicking select all wrapped lines belonging to a single logical line.
  * hints kitten: Detect bracketed URLs and dont include the closing bracket in the URL.

  * Don't fail to start if the user deletes the hintstyle key from their fontconfig configuration.
  * When rendering a private use unicode codepoint and a space as a two cell

    colors for the two cells.

    buffer not working correctly if kitty is itself scrolled up.

    when switching windows/tabs using the various keyboard shortcuts.
  * Fix tab title not changing to reflect the window title when switching between different windows in a tab
  * Ignore -e if it is specified on the command line. This is for compatibility
    with broken software that assumes terminals should run with an -e option to
    execute commands instead of just passing the commands as arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 15 17:17:24 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.9.0
  * A new kitty command shell to allow controlling kitty via
    commands. Press ctrl+shift+escape to run the shell.
  * The hints kitten has become much more powerful. Now in addition
    to URLs you can use it to select word, paths, filenames, lines,
    etc. from the screen. These can be inserted into the terminal,
    copied to clipboard or sent to external programs.
  * Switch to libxkbcommon for keyboard handling. It allows kitty to
    support XCompose and dead keys and also react to keyboard
    remapping/layout change without needing a restart.
  * Add support for multiple-key-sequence shortcuts
  * A new remote control command set-colors to change the current
    and/or configured colors.
  * When double-clicking to select a word, select words that continue
    onto the next/prev line as well.

    mouse into the padding area now acts as if the mouse is over
    the nearest cell.

  * Fix using kitty --single-instance to open a new window in a
    running kitty instance, not respecting the --directory flag

    rather than the hints kitten. Fixes launching on some systems
    where xdg-open doesn't like being run from a kitten.
  * Allow using rectangle select mode by pressing shift in addition
    to the rectangle select modifiers even when the terminal program
    has grabbed the mouse.
