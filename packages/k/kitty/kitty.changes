    initially created ones.
  * Backward incompatibility: No longer turn on the kitty extended

    overall title (#3893)
  * Linux: Fix some very long ligatures being rendered incorrectly
    at some font sizes (#3896)

    --linenum-action (#3931)

  * When using the OSC 52 escape code to copy to clipboard allow large
    copies (up to 8MB) without needing a kitty specific chunking protocol.
    Note that if you used the chunking protocol in the past, it will no
    longer work and you should switch to using the unmodified protocol
    which has the advantage of working with all terminal emulators.
  * Fix a bug in the implementation of the synchronized updates escape code
    that could cause incorrect parsing if either the pending buffer
    capacity or the pending timeout were exceeded (#3779)

Mon Sep 10 12:06:28 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.12.1:
  * Add a new kitty --start-in-fullscreen command line flag to start kitty in full screen mode (#856)
  * Linux: Do not enable IME input via ibus unless the GLFW_IM_MODULE=ibus environment variable is set. IME causes key processing latency and even missed keystrokes for many people, so it is now off by default.
  * Fix backspacing of wide characters in wide-character unaware programs not working (#875)
  * Linux: Fix number pad arrow keys not working when Numlock is off (#857)
  * Wayland: Implement support for clipboard copy/paste (#855)
  * Allow mapping shortcuts using the raw key code from the OS (#848)
  * Allow mapping of individual key-presses without modifiers as shortcuts
  * Fix legacy invocation of icat as kitty icat not working (#850)
  * Improve rendering of wavy underline at small font sizes (#853)
  * Fix a regression in 0.12.0 that broke dynamic resizing of layouts (#860)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 06:27:08 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.12.0:
  * Preserve the mouse selection even when the contents of the screen are scrolled or overwritten provided the new text does not intersect the selected lines.
  * Linux: Implement support for Input Method Extensions (multilingual input using standard keyboards) via IBus (#469)
  * Implement completion for the kitty command in bash and zsh. See Completion for kitty.
  * Render the text under the cursor in a fixed color, configurable via the option cursor_text_color (#126)
  * Add an option env to set environment variables in child processes from kitty.conf
  * Implement high precision scrolling with the trackpad on platforms such as macOS and Wayland that implement it. (#819)
  * Remote control: Allow changing the current window layout with a new kitty @ goto-layout command (#845)
  * Remote control: Allow matching windows by the environment variables of their child process as well
  * Allow running kittens via the remote control system (#738)
  * Allow enabling remote control in only some kitty windows
  * Add a keyboard shortcut to reset the terminal (ctrl+shift+delete). It takes parameters so you can define your own shortcuts to clear the screen/scrollback also (#747)

  * Fix detection of URLs in HTML source code (URLs inside quotes) (#785)
  * Implement support for emoji skin tone modifiers (#787)
  * Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj is still not implemented, since it can cause the collapse of an unbounded number of characters into a single cell. However, kitty at least preserves the zwj by storing it as a combining character.
  * Linux: Fix slow startup on some systems caused by GLFW searching for joysticks. Since kitty does not use joysticks, disable joystick support. (#830)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 08:53:36 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.11.3:
  * Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn. The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the draw_minimal_borders setting in kitty.conf.
  * Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled (#703)
  * When dragging to select with the mouse "grab" the mouse so that if it strays into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated (#624)

  * When drag-scrolling stop the scroll when the mouse button is released.
  * Fix a regression in the previous release that caused pasting large amounts of text to be duplicated (#709)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 09:44:23 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

  * Remote control: Speed-up reading of command responses
  * Linux installer: Fix installer failing on systems with python < 3.5
  * Support “-T” as an alias for “–title” (#659)

- Update to 0.9.1:
  * Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the
    tab and the window is not the currently focused window
  * Change the window border color if a bell occurs in an unfocused window. Can
    be disabled by setting the bell_border_color to be the same as the
    inactive_border_color.
  * Unicode input: When searching by name search for prefix matches as well as whole word matches
  * Dynamically allocate the memory used for the scrollback history buffer.
  * Reduces startup memory consumption when using very large scrollback buffer sizes.

    with broken software that assumes terminals should run with an -e option to
    execute commands instead of just passing the commands as arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 15 17:17:24 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.9.0
  * A new kitty command shell to allow controlling kitty via
    commands. Press ctrl+shift+escape to run the shell.
  * The hints kitten has become much more powerful. Now in addition
    to URLs you can use it to select word, paths, filenames, lines,
    etc. from the screen. These can be inserted into the terminal,
    copied to clipboard or sent to external programs.
  * Switch to libxkbcommon for keyboard handling. It allows kitty to
    support XCompose and dead keys and also react to keyboard
    remapping/layout change without needing a restart.
  * Add support for multiple-key-sequence shortcuts

    to the rectangle select modifiers even when the terminal program
    has grabbed the mouse.
