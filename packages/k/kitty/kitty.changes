- Update to 0.24.0:
  * Integrate kitty closely with common shells such as zsh, fish
    and bash. This allows lots of niceties such as jumping to

    a new window, etc. See Shell integration for details.
    Packagers please read Notes for Linux/macOS packagers.
  * A new shortcut ctrl+shift+f7 to visually focus a window using
    the keyboard. Pressing it causes numbers to appear over each
    visible window and you can press the number to focus the
    corresponding window (#4110)

    as logo in the corner of a kitty window (#4167)

  * When programs ask to read from the clipboard prompt, ask the user
    to allow the request by default instead of denying it by
    default. See clipboard_control for details (#4022)
  * A new mappable action swap_with_window to swap the current
    window with another window in the tab, visually
  * A new remote control command <kitty @ set-enabled-layouts> to

  * Unicode input kitten: Implement scrolling when more results
    are found than the available display space (#4068)
  * Allow middle clicking on a tab to close it (#4151)
  * The command line option --watcher has been deprecated in favor

    applying to all windows, not just the initially created ones.
    Note that --watcher now also applies to all windows, not just
    initially created ones.
  * Backward incompatibility: No longer turn on the kitty extended
    keyboard protocol’s disambiguate mode when the client sends the

    needed to build the doc

  * Make the visual bell flash more gentle, especially on dark
    themes (#2937)
  * Fix kitty --title not overriding the OS Window title when
    multiple tabs are present. Also this option is no longer used
    as the default title for windows, allowing individual tabs/windows
    to have their own titles, even when the OS Window has a fixed
    overall title (#3893)
  * Linux: Fix some very long ligatures being rendered incorrectly
    at some font sizes (#3896)
  * Fix shift+middle click to paste sending a mouse press event
    but no release event which breaks some applications that grab

    --linenum-action (#3931)

    mouse_selection move-end.
  * When opening hyperlinks, allow defining open actions for directories (#3836)
  * When using the OSC 52 escape code to copy to clipboard allow large
    copies (up to 8MB) without needing a kitty specific chunking protocol.
    Note that if you used the chunking protocol in the past, it will no
    longer work and you should switch to using the unmodified protocol
    which has the advantage of working with all terminal emulators.
  * Fix a bug in the implementation of the synchronized updates escape code
    that could cause incorrect parsing if either the pending buffer
    capacity or the pending timeout were exceeded (#3779)
  * A new remote control command to resize the OS Window <kitty @ resize-os-window>

    most other programs and allows long chains of them to look better (#3844)
  * hints kitten: Detect paths and hashes that appear over multiple lines. Note
    that this means that all line breaks in the text are no longer n soft breaks
    are instead r. If you use a custom regular expression that is meant to match
    over line breaks, you will need to match over both. (#3845)
  * Allow leading or trailing spaces in tab_activity_symbol
  * Fix mouse actions not working when caps lock or num lock are engaged (#3859)
  * clipboard kitten: fix copies to clipboard not working without the kitty +kitten
    clipboard --wait-for-completion option

    bar at the top (#3258)
  * Fix window icon not working on X11 with 64bits (#3260)

    and CascadiaCode. Now such ligatures are detected based on glyph naming convention.
    This removes the gap in the ligatures at cell boundaries (#2695)

  * A new last_used_layout function that can be mapped to a shortcut to switch to the previously used window layout (#870)
  * New neighboring_window and move_window functions to switch to neighboring windows in the current layout, and move them around, similar to window movement in vim (#916)

  * Add a new kitty --start-as command line flag to start kitty full-screen/maximized/minimized. This replaces the --start-in-fullscreen flag introduced in the previous release (#935)
  * When mapping the new_tab action allow specifying that the tab should open next to the current tab instead of at the end of the tabs list (#979)

- Update to 0.12.1:
  * Add a new kitty --start-in-fullscreen command line flag to start kitty in full screen mode (#856)
  * Linux: Do not enable IME input via ibus unless the GLFW_IM_MODULE=ibus environment variable is set. IME causes key processing latency and even missed keystrokes for many people, so it is now off by default.
  * Fix backspacing of wide characters in wide-character unaware programs not working (#875)
  * Linux: Fix number pad arrow keys not working when Numlock is off (#857)

- Update to 0.12.0:
  * Preserve the mouse selection even when the contents of the screen are scrolled or overwritten provided the new text does not intersect the selected lines.
  * Linux: Implement support for Input Method Extensions (multilingual input using standard keyboards) via IBus (#469)
  * Implement completion for the kitty command in bash and zsh. See Completion for kitty.

  * Round-trip the zwj unicode character. Rendering of sequences containing zwj is still not implemented, since it can cause the collapse of an unbounded number of characters into a single cell. However, kitty at least preserves the zwj by storing it as a combining character.
  * Linux: Fix slow startup on some systems caused by GLFW searching for joysticks. Since kitty does not use joysticks, disable joystick support. (#830)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 08:53:36 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.11.3:
  * Draw only the minimum borders needed for inactive windows. That is only the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all borders to be drawn. The old behavior of drawing all borders can be restored via the draw_minimal_borders setting in kitty.conf.
  * Fix triple-click to select line not working when the entire line is filled (#703)
  * When dragging to select with the mouse "grab" the mouse so that if it strays into neighboring windows, the selection is still updated (#624)

  * When drag-scrolling stop the scroll when the mouse button is released.
  * Fix a regression in the previous release that caused pasting large amounts of text to be duplicated (#709)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the
    tab and the window is not the currently focused window
  * Change the window border color if a bell occurs in an unfocused window. Can
    be disabled by setting the bell_border_color to be the same as the
    inactive_border_color.
  * Unicode input: When searching by name search for prefix matches as well as whole word matches
  * Dynamically allocate the memory used for the scrollback history buffer.
  * Reduces startup memory consumption when using very large scrollback buffer sizes.

- Update to 0.9.0
  * A new kitty command shell to allow controlling kitty via
    commands. Press ctrl+shift+escape to run the shell.

    etc. from the screen. These can be inserted into the terminal,
    copied to clipboard or sent to external programs.
  * Switch to libxkbcommon for keyboard handling. It allows kitty to
    support XCompose and dead keys and also react to keyboard
    remapping/layout change without needing a restart.
  * Add support for multiple-key-sequence shortcuts
  * A new remote control command set-colors to change the current
    and/or configured colors.
  * When double-clicking to select a word, select words that continue
    onto the next/prev line as well.
  * Add an include directive for the config files to read multiple
    config files
  * Improve mouse selection for windows with padding. Moving the
    mouse into the padding area now acts as if the mouse is over
    the nearest cell.
  * Allow setting all 256 terminal colors in the config file
  * Fix using kitty --single-instance to open a new window in a
    running kitty instance, not respecting the --directory flag
  * URL hints: Exclude trailing punctuation from URLs
  * URL hints: Launch the browser from the kitty parent process
    rather than the hints kitten. Fixes launching on some systems
    where xdg-open doesn't like being run from a kitten.
  * Allow using rectangle select mode by pressing shift in addition
    to the rectangle select modifiers even when the terminal program
    has grabbed the mouse.
