  <title>Qt browser for journald database</title>
  <description>This project aims to provide an abstraction of the systemd’s journald API in
terms of QAbstractItemModel classes. The main purpose is to ease the
integration of journald into Qt based applications (both QML and QtWidget).
Additional to the library, the project provides a reference implementation of
the API, called kjournaldbrowser. Even though that application provides a
powerful journal database reader, we aim to do a clear split between 
reuseable library and application logic.
