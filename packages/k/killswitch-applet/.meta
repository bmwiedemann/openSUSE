  <title>Manage Killswitches</title>
  <description>killswitch-applet is a small application sitting in the system tray
providing the possibility to manage all the killswitches found in the
system. In this context, &quot;managing&quot; means enabling or disabling certain
killswitches. This is especially useful if you have multiple killswitches
like bluetooth, WWAN or WLAN.</description>
