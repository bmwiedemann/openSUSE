  * _service change disabled to manual per osc deprecation warning:
    WARNING: Command 'disabledrun/dr' is obsolete, please convert
    your _service to use 'manual' and then 'manualrun/mr' instead.
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.20 matching go.mod
  * Re-enable binary stripping and debuginfo boo#1210938
  * Drop BuildRequires: go-md2man and use plain markdown as %doc
  * Drop BuildRequires: fdupes and usage during install step. Go
    application packages have a small number of installed files and
    this hasn't been an issue following the transition from GOPATH
  * Drop ExcludeArch: s390
  * Remove ldflags -X entries for upstream import path and version.
    This information is embedded in binaries with go1.18+ and
    available via go version -m or runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo().
  * Remove define git commit ref no longer needed
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Add basic %check to execute binary --help

Thu Nov 15 18:21:19 UTC 2018 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- Update to kured 1.1.0
- Upstream bumped dependency on go1.10 via dependency k8s.io/client-go 0.9.0
  https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go
- Provide dependencies in separate vendor.tar.gz
- Improvements
  * RBAC support
  * Use the systemctl in the host mount namespace to effect reboots, reducing
    image size and eliminating the potential for incompatibility
  * Notify Slack on drain in addition to reboot
  * Pass through log output from invoked kubectl commands
  * Tolerate NoSchedule taint on node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  * Fixed reversal of daemonset name/namespace arguments and comments in the
    manifest
- Kubernetes Version Compatibility
  * The daemon image contains a 1.12.x k8s.io/client-go and kubectl binary for
    the purposes of maintaining the lock and draining worker nodes. Kubernetes
    aims to provide forwards & backwards compatibility of one minor version
    between client and server, so this should work on 1.11.x and 1.13.x.
  * Tested in minikube on 1.11.4, 1.12.1 & 1.13.0-alpha.2
  * Tested in production on 1.11.2 & 1.12.2
