- Update to version 0.5.0:
  * The main theme of this release is increased coverage - namely resources that will be removed in Kubernetes versions 1.22 and 1.25 (#156, #159, #160, #163, #165, #166, #168, #169, #170, #171, #172, #173, #174, #175).
  * We also worked on making the tool more user friendly and useable out of the box:
    - Detecting K8s version (#139) and display only relevant results (#182)
    - Support for multiple kubeconfig files (#191) and selecting K8S context (#194)
    - Building ARM binaries for Linux and Mac (#133)
  * Fixed a few bugs too, and increased test coverage, sped up build process. And bIg clap to @david-doit-intl for laying out foundations for integration testing (#152).
