- Pull in kio-extras5 when kio-extras (6) is installed, so e.g.
  smb and sftp also work with kio-fuse, not only in dolphin
  (boo#1226378).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  9 22:14:57 UTC 2023 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Update to version 5.1.0:
  * Support for building against Qt 6 and KF6
  * Minimum versions of dependencies got raised:
    CMake 3.16, Qt 5.15, KIO 5.96.0
  * Minor bug fixes and optimizations
  * Don't include the password in the generated VFS path
  * Mounting admin: is blocked now
- Drop patch, now upstream:
  * 0001-Initialize-m_lastChildrenRefresh-to-be-really-in-the.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 11 00:56:22 UTC 2023 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- dbus-run-session now needs to be explicitly required for the
  test suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  7 11:15:11 UTC 2022 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Replace %_libdir/libexec with %_libexecdir (boo#1174075)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 14:00:13 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Use %pkg_vcmp for util-linux requirement for %check
- Add patch to avoid occasional test failure:
  * 0001-Initialize-m_lastChildrenRefresh-to-be-really-in-the.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 21 14:37:43 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Update to version 5.0.1:
  * Changes to a directory while iterating it (opendir/readdir) don't break the
    iteration anymore
  * Some ioslaves with incompatible behaviour (they claim "/" is a regular file)
    are rejected now. Previously, mounting those succeeded, but accessing files
    failed. Now mounting fails immediately and the fallback code is triggered.
  * Mixup of UDS_URL/UDS_TARGET_URL got fixed. Now the baloosearch:/ protocol
    works and doesn't cause a crash anymore. Additionally, the relevant code got
    hardened.
- Install by default: supplement dolphin

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 26 20:39:54 UTC 2020 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Update to version 5.0.0:
  * Symlinks with an absolute target path are "rewritten" to point to the
    location inside the target instead of the host system
  * Mounting a URL which includes symlinks now works
  * Quite a bit of refactoring and cleanup, also for ^
  * The DBus service can use systemd activation now

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 26 17:57:40 UTC 2020 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Update to version 4.95.0:
  * Use of KIO::FileJob to write and read without downloading the whole file
  * Expiring local nodes so that changes on the remote side become visible
    (the local cache is valid for at most 30s)
  * New DBus API to map a FUSE path back to a remote URL, used for syncing the
    terminal panel in dolphin to the main view (needs Dolphin from git master)
  * Minimum version of Qt got raised to 5.12
  * Minimum version of KIO got raised to 5.66 (needed for KIO::FileJob)
  * Builds with CMake < 3.13 again
- Drop patches, now upstream:
  * 0001-Use-target_link_libraries-instead-of-target_link_opt.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 31 18:46:53 UTC 2019 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
