- Update to version 4.95.0:
  * Use of KIO::FileJob to write and read without downloading the whole file
  * Expiring local nodes so that changes on the remote side become visible
    (the local cache is valid for at most 30s)
  * New DBus API to map a FUSE path back to a remote URL, used for syncing the
    terminal panel in dolphin to the main view (needs Dolphin from git master)
  * Minimum version of Qt got raised to 5.12
  * Minimum version of KIO got raised to 5.66 (needed for KIO::FileJob)
  * Builds with CMake < 3.13 again
- Drop patches, now upstream:
  * 0001-Use-target_link_libraries-instead-of-target_link_opt.patch
