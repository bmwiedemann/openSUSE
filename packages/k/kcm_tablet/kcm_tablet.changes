Tue Dec 18 21:09:05 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to version 3.1.1
  * Some translation related fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 23 15:50:22 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to version 3.1.0
- Major changes:
  * LibWacom support. This should get our number of supported
    tablets out of the box on par with GNOME. Right now built-in
    database and user-configured database still take preference
    over libwacom, but this should change in the future releases.
  * Calibration improvements: calibration of Cintiq devices should
    be vastly improved, UI now has options to lock mapped area
    proportions and manually fine-tune area's coordinates. Also,
    the dialog should now open on the correct screen and look fine
    with dark themes too.
  * Support for devices that report different USB IDs for
    touchscreen and may be detected as two different devices (e.g.
    Cintiq Companion Hybrid).
    These devices need to be described via Wacom Tablet finder
    tool first, though.
- Other changes:
  * Logging has been ported to QLoggingCategory (so now users have
    to enable it in kdebugsettings).
  * Status LED support improvements (Vangelis Tasoulas, Jason
    Gerecke).
  * Touchscreen rotation should now follow tablet rotation.
- New devices in built-in database:
  * Wacom Intuos Pro L (PTH-860, 2017) (Melvin Vermeeren)
  * Lenovo Yoga 520 (Felipe Abrahao)
  * ThinkPad Yoga 460 definition  (Albert Astals Cid)
  * Wacom Intuos Pro 2 M (Jeff H)
- Requires Qt 5.7.0 or higher now to compile successfully

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 09:47:25 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to version 3.0.0
  * Implemented hotplugging on Xlib (by Fabian Vogt). Hotplugging
    should now work on Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, and all
    other distributions that don't build libXCB with Xinput
    enabled.
  * Screen mapping configuration now uses output names instead of
    screen indices. This invalidates existing screen mapping
    configurations.
  * Tablet Finder should no longer skip button detection.
  * First steps in fixing rotation handling in multi-screen setup.
    However, for now if you want your screen rotation to be
    tracked, it has to be set as primary screen. Qt bug:
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-65598
  * Minor calibration dialog fixes. Calibration still might be off
    with Cintiq devices. Fixing those would require some feedback:
    https://userbase.kde.org/Wacomtablet#Calibration_issues_.26_manual_calibration
  * New device definitions:
    + Lenovo Yoga 520 (by Felipe Abrahao)
    + Wacom Intuos Pro L (PTH-860) (by Melvin Vermeeren)
    + Wacom Bamboo One M (CTL-671) (by Alexander)
- Drop Implement-hotplugging-on-Xlib.patch, merged upstream
- Mark license file as %license

Tue Jan 16 12:09:29 UTC 2018 - fabian@ritter-vogt.de

- Add Supplements: packageand(plasma5-workspace:xf86-input-wacom)
- Run spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  2 21:42:54 UTC 2018 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Add Implement-hotplugging-on-Xlib.patch to make hotplugging work
  with Xlib too, without libxcb-xinput which we don't have yet
  (kde#361743)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 30 17:18:12 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to version 2.9.82 (3.0.0 beta 2)
  * ported to KF5
  * This version has a few multi-screen fixes and couple of new device IDs.
    It also should no longer crash kded under wayland (however there's no
    actual wayland support yet).
    There are still two somewhat major issues: hotplug detection is not
    supported if libxcb doesn't have xinput support enabled (most likely
    affects Debian and Ubuntu), and screen rotation of non-mapped screens is
    not handled properly. Barring these, this beta should be stable enough
    for use in static setups and should be good enough to package.
- Moved english documentation into the main package
