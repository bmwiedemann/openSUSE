  <title>A KCM Module for configuring Telepathy Instant Messaging Accounts.</title>
  <description> This is a KControl Module which handles adding/editing/removing Telepathy 
 Accounts. It interacts with any Telepathy Spec compliant AccountManager, 
 such as telepathy-accountmanager-kwallet to manipulate the accounts. It is 
 modular in design, with each ConnectionManager-Protocol combination having a 
 plugin that provides customised forms for adding or editing their accounts, 
 and also with a generic plugin which can be used as a fallback for 
 ConnectionManager-Protocol combinations where no plugin exists.</description>
