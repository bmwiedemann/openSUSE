  <title>Qt dock widget library, suitable for replacing QDockWidget</title>
  <description>KDDockWidgets is a Qt dock widget library written by KDAB, suitable for
replacing QDockWidget and implementing advanced functionalities missing in Qt.

Although KDDockWidgets is ready to be used out of the box, it can also be seen
as a framework to allow building very tailored custom docking systems. It tries
to expose every internal widget and every knob for the app developer to tune.
