- Update to 2.0.0
  * Architecture rewrite to support more frontends besides
    QtWidgets and QtQuick. 2.0 isn't very interesting for users,
    but will allow developers to make KDDW support other GUI
    frameworks more easily. Also QtQuick is now better integrated,
    without being shoehorned with ifdefs into the QtWidgets
    implementation.
    + Split into a view/controller architecture
    + Non-gui logic moved to controllers
    + Each controller has a gui counter part, implemented for each
      supported frontend
  * Uses nlohmann JSON library (MIT) instead of QJsonDocument, for
    saving/restoring layouts
  * Added Config::setStartDragDistance()
  * Removed Config::setTabbingAllowedFunc() which was already
    deprecated in favor of Config::setDropIndicatorAllowedFunc()
  * Slint and Flutter WIP. Waiting for these frameworks to
    support multi-window before finishing.

  * Fixed fixed-sized windows being able to be resized on Windows
  * Allow restoring layouts without touching floating dock widgets
  * Fix setDropIndicatorsInhibited(false) not showing
    drop indicators
  * Fix relayouting when dock widget is deleted directly
