Using the Keybase Filesystem Tool
=================================

The Keybase Filesystem tool requires a valid Keybase login session and the
Keybase service to be running. To log in to keybase run `keybase login`.
This will automatically start the Keybase service.

Logging in will typically only have to happen once. To only start the
service run `systemctl --user start keybase` or run any command using
the Keybase command line client.
