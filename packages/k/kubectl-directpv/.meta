  <title>Kubectl plugin for the MinIO CSI driver for Direct Attached Storage</title>
  <description>DirectPV is a CSI driver for Direct Attached Storage. In a simpler sense, it is a distributed persistent volume manager, and not a storage system like SAN or NAS. It is useful to discover, format, mount, schedule and monitor drives across servers.

This package contains the Kubectl plugin to manage the DirectPV CSI driver.</description>
