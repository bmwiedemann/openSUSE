%description
Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup/restore tool that allows you to
create encrypted snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to remote or
cloud storage of your choice, to network-attached storage or server, or locally
on your machine. Kopia does not 'image' your whole machine. Rather, Kopia
allows you to backup/restore any and all files/directories that you deem are
important or critical.
