  <title>Traditional Thai Puzzle Board Game in 3D with Wooden Blocks</title>
  <description>The goal of this game is to move the biggest token to a specific
position. A tutorial and solution hint is available for beginners. The
game is visible as a three-dimensional model with different camera
positions. All movements, including the menus, are physically
calculated.

Different themes, like wood, rock, metal, marble, bubbles, and
painting, are available. Themes influence both the display and the
sound effects. Ambient and Drum &amp; Bass music from Nifflas
(www.nifflas.com) gives the game a unique atmosphere.</description>
