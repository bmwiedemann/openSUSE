  <title>KDE Helper for multithreaded programming</title>
  <description>ThreadWeaver is a helper for multithreaded programming. It uses a job-based
interface to queue tasks and execute them in an efficient way.

You simply divide the workload into jobs, state the dependencies between jobs
and ThreadWeaver will work out the most efficient way of dividing the work
between threads within a set of resource limits.
