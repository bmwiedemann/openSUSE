- CVE-2025-1767: GitRepo Volume Inadvertent Local Repository Access, bsc#1239643                                     

  * TL;DR: Please refer to the github issue for details on detecting and mitigating the CVE, if impacted:
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/130786

  ****Important note to users and administrators****

  * How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

   To mitigate this vulnerability, you must use an init container to perform git clone operation and then mount the directory into the Pod's container. An example of this approach is provided here: https://gist.github.com/tallclair/849601a16cebeee581ef2be50c351841

   Note: You can also restrict the use of gitRepo volumes in your cluster using policies such as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy or through Restricted pod security standard policy. You can use the following Common Expression Language (CEL) expression as part of a policy to reject use of gitRepo volumes:
  `has(object.spec.volumes) || !object.spec.volumes.exists(v, has(v.gitRepo))`

  * Detection:

   To detect whether this vulnerability has been exploited, you can use the following command to list all pods that use the in-tree gitRepo volume and clones to a .git subdirectory.

   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.spec.volumes[].gitRepo.repository | test("^/")) | {name: .metadata.name, namespace: .metadata.namespace, repository: (.spec.volumes[] | select(.gitRepo) | .gitRepo.repository)}'
   ```

   Please plan and consider migrating to Kubernetes v1.33 (~ Release Date: April 23, 2025).
   Since starting v1.33, the impacted gitRepo volume plugin will be disabled by default.
   Refer: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129923

   No prior Kubernetes versions (v1.29 - v1.32), will receive any backport fixe patches for this CVE, since there isn't a fully non-code-breaking patch available.
