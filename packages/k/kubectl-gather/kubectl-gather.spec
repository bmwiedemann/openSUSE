%description
This is a kubectl plugin for gathering data about your cluster that may help to
debug issues.

Kubernetes is big and complicated, and when something breaks it is hard to tell
which info is needed for debugging. Even if you known which resources or logs
are needed, it is hard to get the data manually. When working with multiple
related clusters gathering the right data from the right cluster is even
harder.

The kubectl gather tool makes it easy to gather data quickly from multiple
clusters with a single command. It gathers all resources from all clusters. It
also gather related data such as pods logs, on for specific cases, external
logs stored on the nodes. The data is stored in a local directory, one file per
resource, making it easy to navigate and inspect using standard tools. If you
know what you want to gather, it is much faster and consume fraction of the
storage to gather only specific namespaces from all clusters.
