- Update to version 1.23.2:
  * Enhancements:
    - Enabled configuration of standby-sensitive parameters during
      recovery using a physical backup (#4564)
    - Enabled the configuration of the liveness probe timeout via
      the .spec.livenessProbeTimeout option (#4719)
    - cnpg plugin for kubectl:
      * Enhanced support for ANSI colors in the plugin by adding
        the --color option, which accepts always, never, and auto
        (default) as values (#4775)
      * The plugin is now available on Homebrew for macOS users
        (#4602)
  * Fixes:
    - Prevented fenced instances from entering an unnecessary loop
      and consuming all available CPU (#4625)
    - Resolved an issue where the instance manager on the primary
      would indefinitely wait for the instance to start after
      encountering a failure following a stop operation (#4434)
    - Fixed an issue where the interaction between
      hot_standby_feedback and managed cluster-level replication
      slots was preventing the autovacuum from operating correctly;
      this issue was causing disk space to remain occupied by dead
      tuples (#4811)
    - Fixed a panic in the backup controller that occurred when pod
      container statuses were missing (#4765)
    - Prevented unnecessary shutdown of the instance manager
      (#4670)
    - Prevented unnecessary reloads of PostgreSQL configuration
      when unchanged (#4531)
    - Prevented unnecessary reloads of the ident map by ensuring a
      consistent and unique method of writing its content (#4648)
    - Avoided conflicts during phase registration by patching the
      status of the resource instead of updating it (#4637)
    - Implemented a timeout when restarting PostgreSQL and lifting
      fencing (#4504)
    - Ensured that a replica cluster is restarted after promotion
      to properly set the archive mode (#4399)
    - Removed an unneeded concurrent keep-alive routine that was
      causing random failures in volume snapshot backups (#4768)
    - Ensured correct parsing of the additional rows field returned
      when the pgaudit.log_rows option was enabled, preventing
      audit logs from being incorrectly routed to the normal log
      stream (#4394)
    - cnpg plugin for kubectl:
      * Resolved an issue with listing PDBs using the cnpg status
        command (#4530)
  * Changes
    Default operand image set to PostgreSQL 16.3 (#4584)
    Removed all RBAC requirements on namespace objects (#4753)
