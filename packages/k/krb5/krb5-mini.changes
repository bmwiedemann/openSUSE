- Drop 0009-Fix-KDC-null-deref-on-TGS-inner-body-null-server.patch,
  already fixed in release 1.20.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 16 07:49:09 UTC 2022 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Update to 1.20.1; (bsc#1205126); (CVE-2022-42898);
  * Fix integer overflows in PAC parsing [CVE-2022-42898].
  * Fix null deref in KDC when decoding invalid NDR.
  * Fix memory leak in OTP kdcpreauth module.
  * Fix PKCS11 module path search.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 29 19:14:02 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.20.0:
  * Added a "disable_pac" realm relation to suppress adding PAC authdata
    to tickets, for realms which do not need to support S4U requests.
  * Most credential cache types will use atomic replacement when a cache
    is reinitialized using kinit or refreshed from the client keytab.
  * kprop can now propagate databases with a dump size larger than 4GB,
    if both the client and server are upgraded.
  * kprop can now work over NATs that change the destination IP address,
    if the client is upgraded.
  * Updated the KDB interface.  The sign_authdata() method is replaced
    with the issue_pac() method, allowing KDB modules to add logon info
    and other buffers to the PAC issued by the KDC.
  * Host-based initiator names are better supported in the GSS krb5
    mechanism.
  * Replaced AD-SIGNEDPATH authdata with minimal PACs.
  * To avoid spurious replay errors, password change requests will not
    be attempted over UDP until the attempt over TCP fails.
  * PKINIT will sign its CMS messages with SHA-256 instead of SHA-1.
  * Updated all code using OpenSSL to be compatible with OpenSSL 3.
  * Reorganized the libk5crypto build system to allow the OpenSSL
    back-end to pull in material from the builtin back-end depending on
    the OpenSSL version.
  * Simplified the PRNG logic to always use the platform PRNG.
  * Converted the remaining Tcl tests to Python.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  5 10:36:51 UTC 2021 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Update to 1.19
  Administrator experience
    * When a client keytab is present, the GSSAPI krb5 mech will refresh
      credentials even if the current credentials were acquired manually.
    * It is now harder to accidentally delete the K/M entry from a KDB.
  Developer experience
    * gss_acquire_cred_from() now supports the "password" and "verify"
      options, allowing credentials to be acquired via password and
      verified using a keytab key.
    * When an application accepts a GSS security context, the new
      GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG will be set if the initiator and acceptor
      both provided matching channel bindings.
    * Added the GSS_KRB5_NT_X509_CERT name type, allowing S4U2Self requests
      to identify the desired client principal by certificate.
    * PKINIT certauth modules can now cause the hw-authent flag to be set
      in issued tickets.
    * The krb5_init_creds_step() API will now issue the same password
      expiration warnings as krb5_get_init_creds_password().
  Protocol evolution
    * Added client and KDC support for Microsoft's Resource-Based Constrained
      Delegation, which allows cross-realm S4U2Proxy requests. A third-party
      database module is required for KDC support.
    * kadmin/admin is now the preferred server principal name for kadmin
      connections, and the host-based form is no longer created by default.
      The client will still try the host-based form as a fallback.
    * Added client and server support for Microsoft's KERB_AP_OPTIONS_CBT
      extension, which causes channel bindings to be required for the
      initiator if the acceptor provided them. The client will send this
      option if the client_aware_gss_bindings profile option is set.
  User experience
    * kinit will now issue a warning if the des3-cbc-sha1 encryption type is
      used in the reply. This encryption type will be deprecated and removed
      in future releases.
    * Added kvno flags --out-cache, --no-store, and --cached-only
      (inspired by Heimdal's kgetcred).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 19 09:30:13 UTC 2020 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Update to 1.18.3
  * Fix a denial of service vulnerability when decoding Kerberos
    protocol messages; (CVE-2020-28196); (bsc#1178512);
  * Fix a locking issue with the LMDB KDB module which could cause
    KDC and kadmind processes to lose access to the database.
  * Fix an assertion failure when libgssapi_krb5 is repeatedly loaded
    and unloaded while libkrb5support remains loaded.

  no reasonable justification to step out of the defaults.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 29 08:38:37 UTC 2020 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Update to 1.18.2
  * Fix a SPNEGO regression where an acceptor using the default credential
    would improperly filter mechanisms, causing a negotiation failure.
  * Fix a bug where the KDC would fail to issue tickets if the local krbtgt
    principal's first key has a single-DES enctype.
  * Add stub functions to allow old versions of OpenSSL libcrypto to link
    against libkrb5.
  * Fix a NegoEx bug where the client name and delegated credential might
    not be reported.

- Upgrade to 1.18.1
  * Fix a crash when qualifying short hostnames when the system has
    no primary DNS domain.
  * Fix a regression when an application imports "service@" as a GSS
    host-based name for its acceptor credential handle.
  * Fix KDC enforcement of auth indicators when they are modified by
    the KDB module.
  * Fix removal of require_auth string attributes when the LDAP KDB
    module is used.
  * Fix a compile error when building with musl libc on Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 17 17:26:16 UTC 2020 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Upgrade to 1.18
  Administrator experience:
    * Remove support for single-DES encryption types.
    * Change the replay cache format to be more efficient and robust.
      Replay cache filenames using the new format end with ".rcache2"
      by default.
    * setuid programs will automatically ignore environment variables
      that normally affect krb5 API functions, even if the caller does
      not use krb5_init_secure_context().
    * Add an "enforce_ok_as_delegate" krb5.conf relation to disable
      credential forwarding during GSSAPI authentication unless the KDC
      sets the ok-as-delegate bit in the service ticket.
    * Use the permitted_enctypes krb5.conf setting as the default value
      for default_tkt_enctypes and default_tgs_enctypes.
  Developer experience:
    * Implement krb5_cc_remove_cred() for all credential cache types.
    * Add the krb5_pac_get_client_info() API to get the client account
      name from a PAC.
  Protocol evolution:
    * Add KDC support for S4U2Self requests where the user is identified
      by X.509 certificate. (Requires support for certificate lookup from
      a third-party KDB module.)
    * Remove support for an old ("draft 9") variant of PKINIT.
    * Add support for Microsoft NegoEx. (Requires one or more third-party
      GSS modules implementing NegoEx mechanisms.)
  User experience:
    * Add support for "dns_canonicalize_hostname=fallback", causing
      host-based principal names to be tried first without DNS
      canonicalization, and again with DNS canonicalization if the
      un-canonicalized server is not found.
    * Expand single-component hostnames in host-based principal names
      when DNS canonicalization is not used, adding the system's first DNS
      search path as a suffix. Add a "qualify_shortname" krb5.conf relation
      to override this suffix or disable expansion.
    * Honor the transited-policy-checked ticket flag on application servers,
      eliminating the requirement to configure capaths on servers in some
      scenarios.
  Code quality:
    * The libkrb5 serialization code (used to export and import krb5 GSS
      security contexts) has been simplified and made type-safe.
    * The libkrb5 code for creating KRB-PRIV, KRB-SAFE, and KRB-CRED
      messages has been revised to conform to current coding practices.
    * The test suite has been modified to work with macOS System Integrity
      Protection enabled.
    * The test suite incorporates soft-pkcs11 so that PKINIT PKCS11 support
      can always be tested.
- Updated patches:
  * 0002-krb5-1.9-manpaths.patch
  * 0004-krb5-1.6.3-gssapi_improve_errormessages.patch
  * 0005-krb5-1.6.3-ktutil-manpage.patch

- Replace old $RPM_* shell vars

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 14 16:10:06 UTC 2019 - Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>

- Upgrade to 1.17. Major changes:
  Administrator experience:
  * A new Kerberos database module using the Lightning Memory-Mapped
    Database library (LMDB) has been added.  The LMDB KDB module should
    be more performant and more robust than the DB2 module, and may
    become the default module for new databases in a future release.
  * "kdb5_util dump" will no longer dump policy entries when specific
    principal names are requested.
  Developer experience:
  * The new krb5_get_etype_info() API can be used to retrieve enctype,
    salt, and string-to-key parameters from the KDC for a client
    principal.
  * The new GSS_KRB5_NT_ENTERPRISE_NAME name type allows enterprise
    principal names to be used with GSS-API functions.
  * KDC and kadmind modules which call com_err() will now write to the
    log file in a format more consistent with other log messages.
  * Programs which use large numbers of memory credential caches should
    perform better.
  Protocol evolution:
  * The SPAKE pre-authentication mechanism is now supported.  This
    mechanism protects against password dictionary attacks without
    requiring any additional infrastructure such as certificates.  SPAKE
    is enabled by default on clients, but must be manually enabled on
    the KDC for this release.
  * PKINIT freshness tokens are now supported.  Freshness tokens can
    protect against scenarios where an attacker uses temporary access to
    a smart card to generate authentication requests for the future.
  * Password change operations now prefer TCP over UDP, to avoid
    spurious error messages about replays when a response packet is
    dropped.
  * The KDC now supports cross-realm S4U2Self requests when used with a
    third-party KDB module such as Samba's.  The client code for
    cross-realm S4U2Self requests is also now more robust
    (CVE-2018-20217).
  User experience:
  * The new ktutil addent -f flag can be used to fetch salt information
    from the KDC for password-based keys.
  * The new kdestroy -p option can be used to destroy a credential cache
    within a collection by client principal name.
  * The Kerberos man page has been restored, and documents the
    environment variables that affect programs using the Kerberos
    library.
  Code quality:
  * Python test scripts now use Python 3.
  * Python test scripts now display markers in verbose output, making it
    easier to find where a failure occurred within the scripts.
  * The Windows build system has been simplified and updated to work
    with more recent versions of Visual Studio.  A large volume of
    unused Windows-specific code has been removed.  Visual Studio 2013
    or later is now required.
- Use systemd-tmpfiles to create files under /var/lib/kerberos, required
  by transactional updates; (bsc#1100126);
- Rename patches:
  * krb5-1.12-pam.patch => 0001-krb5-1.12-pam.patch
  * krb5-1.9-manpaths.dif => 0002-krb5-1.9-manpaths.patch

  * krb5-1.6.3-ktutil-manpage.dif => 0005-krb5-1.6.3-ktutil-manpage.patch
  * krb5-1.12-api.patch => 0006-krb5-1.12-api.patch
  * krb5-1.12-ksu-path.patch => 0007-krb5-1.12-ksu-path.patch
  * krb5-1.12-selinux-label.patch =>  0008-krb5-1.12-selinux-label.patch
  * krb5-1.9-debuginfo.patch => 0009-krb5-1.9-debuginfo.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  9 20:13:24 UTC 2018 - James McDonough <jmcdonough@suse.com>

  * enable "encrypted_challenge_indicator" realm option on tickets
    obtained using FAST encrypted challenge pre-authentication.

    privileges [CVE-2018-5729, CVE-2018-5730].
  * Fix a KDC PKINIT memory leak.
  * Fix a small KDC memory leak on transited or authdata errors when

Sat Dec  3 13:04:11 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- Upgrade to 1.15
- obsoleted Patch7 (krb5-1.7-doublelog.patch) fixed in 1.12.2
- obsoleted patch to src/util/gss-kernel-lib/Makefile.in since
  file is not available in upstream source anymore
- obsoleted Patch15 (krb5-fix_interposer.patch) fixed in 1.15
- doc/CHANGES not available in 1.15 source anymore

- Upgrade from 1.14.4 to 1.15 - major changes:
  Administrator experience:
  * Add support to kadmin for remote extraction of current keys without
    changing them (requires a special kadmin permission that is excluded
    from the wildcard permission), with the exception of highly
    protected keys.
  * Add a lockdown_keys principal attribute to prevent retrieval of the
    principal's keys (old or new) via the kadmin protocol.  In newly
    created databases, this attribute is set on the krbtgt and kadmin
    principals.
  * Restore recursive dump capability for DB2 back end, so sites can
    more easily recover from database corruption resulting from power
    failure events.
  * Add DNS auto-discovery of KDC and kpasswd servers from URI records,
   in addition to SRV records.  URI records can convey TCP and UDP
   servers and master KDC status in a single DNS lookup, and can also
   point to HTTPS proxy servers.
  * Add support for password history to the LDAP back end.
  * Add support for principal renaming to the LDAP back end.
  * Use the getrandom system call on supported Linux kernels to avoid
    blocking problems when getting entropy from the operating system.
  * In the PKINIT client, use the correct DigestInfo encoding for PKCS
    #1 signatures, so that some especially strict smart cards will work.
  Code quality:
  * Clean up numerous compilation warnings.
  * Remove various infrequently built modules, including some preauth
    modules that were not built by default.
  Developer experience:
  * Add support for building with OpenSSL 1.1.
  * Use SHA-256 instead of MD5 for (non-cryptographic) hashing of
    authenticators in the replay cache.  This helps sites that must
    build with FIPS 140 conformant libraries that lack MD5.
  Protocol evolution:
  * Add support for the AES-SHA2 enctypes, which allows sites to conform
    to Suite B crypto requirements.

Major changes in 1.14 (2015-11-20)
==================================

Administrator experience:

* Add a new kdb5_util tabdump command to provide reporting-friendly
  tabular dump formats (tab-separated or CSV) for the KDC database.
  Unlike the normal dump format, each output table has a fixed number
  of fields.  Some tables include human-readable forms of data that
  are opaque in ordinary dump files.  This format is also suitable for
  importing into relational databases for complex queries.
* Add support to kadmin and kadmin.local for specifying a single
  command line following any global options, where the command
  arguments are split by the shell--for example, "kadmin getprinc
  principalname".  Commands issued this way do not prompt for
  confirmation or display warning messages, and exit with non-zero
  status if the operation fails.
* Accept the same principal flag names in kadmin as we do for the
  default_principal_flags kdc.conf variable, and vice versa.  Also
  accept flag specifiers in the form that kadmin prints, as well as
  hexadecimal numbers.
* Remove the triple-DES and RC4 encryption types from the default
  value of supported_enctypes, which determines the default key and
  salt types for new password-derived keys.  By default, keys will
  only created only for AES128 and AES256.  This mitigates some types
  of password guessing attacks.
* Add support for directory names in the KRB5_CONFIG and
  KRB5_KDC_PROFILE environment variables.
* Add support for authentication indicators, which are ticket
  annotations to indicate the strength of the initial authentication.
  Add support for the "require_auth" string attribute, which can be
  set on server principal entries to require an indicator when
  authenticating to the server.
* Add support for key version numbers larger than 255 in keytab files,
  and for version numbers up to 65535 in KDC databases.
* Transmit only one ETYPE-INFO and/or ETYPE-INFO2 entry from the KDC
  during pre-authentication, corresponding to the client's most
  preferred encryption type.
* Add support for server name identification (SNI) when proxying KDC
  requests over HTTPS.
* Add support for the err_fmt profile parameter, which can be used to
  generate custom-formatted error messages.

Code quality:

* Fix memory aliasing issues in SPNEGO and IAKERB mechanisms that
  could cause server crashes. [CVE-2015-2695] [CVE-2015-2696]
  [CVE-2015-2698]
* Fix build_principal memory bug that could cause a KDC
  crash. [CVE-2015-2697]

Developer experience:

* Change gss_acquire_cred_with_password() to acquire credentials into
  a private memory credential cache.  Applications can use
  gss_store_cred() to make the resulting credentials visible to other
  processes.
* Change gss_acquire_cred() and SPNEGO not to acquire credentials for
  IAKERB or for non-standard variants of the krb5 mechanism OID unless
  explicitly requested.  (SPNEGO will still accept the Microsoft
  variant of the krb5 mechanism OID during negotiation.)
* Change gss_accept_sec_context() not to accept tokens for IAKERB or
  for non-standard variants of the krb5 mechanism OID unless an
  acceptor credential is acquired for those mechanisms.
* Change gss_acquire_cred() to immediately resolve credentials if the
  time_rec parameter is not NULL, so that a correct expiration time
  can be returned.  Normally credential resolution is delayed until
  the target name is known.
* Add krb5_prepend_error_message() and krb5_wrap_error_message() APIs,
  which can be used by plugin modules or applications to add prefixes
  to existing detailed error messages.
* Add krb5_c_prfplus() and krb5_c_derive_prfplus() APIs, which
  implement the RFC 6113 PRF+ operation and key derivation using PRF+.
* Add support for pre-authentication mechanisms which use multiple
  round trips, using the the KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED error
  code.  Add get_cookie() and set_cookie() callbacks to the kdcpreauth
  interface; these callbacks can be used to save marshalled state
  information in an encrypted cookie for the next request.
* Add a client_key() callback to the kdcpreauth interface to retrieve
  the chosen client key, corresponding to the ETYPE-INFO2 entry sent
  by the KDC.
* Add an add_auth_indicator() callback to the kdcpreauth interface,
  allowing pre-authentication modules to assert authentication
  indicators.
* Add support for the GSS_KRB5_CRED_NO_CI_FLAGS_X cred option to
  suppress sending the confidentiality and integrity flags in GSS
  initiator tokens unless they are requested by the caller.  These
  flags control the negotiated SASL security layer for the Microsoft
  GSS-SPNEGO SASL mechanism.
* Make the FILE credential cache implementation less prone to
  corruption issues in multi-threaded programs, especially on
  platforms with support for open file description locks.

Performance:

* On slave KDCs, poll the master KDC immediately after processing a
  full resync, and do not require two full resyncs after the master
  KDC's log file is reset.

User experience:

* Make gss_accept_sec_context() accept tickets near their expiration
  but within clock skew tolerances, rather than rejecting them
  immediately after the server's view of the ticket expiration time.

- update to krb5 1.13.2

- DES transition
==============

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is widely recognized as weak.  The
krb5-1.7 release contains measures to encourage sites to migrate away
- From using single-DES cryptosystems.  Among these is a configuration
variable that enables "weak" enctypes, which defaults to "false"
beginning with krb5-1.8.


Major changes in 1.13.2 (2015-05-08)
====================================

This is a bug fix release.

* Fix a minor vulnerability in krb5_read_message, which is primarily
  used in the BSD-derived kcmd suite of applications.  [CVE-2014-5355]

* Fix a bypass of requires_preauth in KDCs that have PKINIT enabled.
  [CVE-2015-2694]

- Update to krb5 1.13
  * Add support for accessing KDCs via an HTTPS proxy server using the
    MS-KKDCP protocol.
  * Add support for hierarchical incremental propagation, where slaves
    can act as intermediates between an upstream master and other downstream
    slaves.
  * Add support for configuring GSS mechanisms using /etc/gss/mech.d/*.conf
    files in addition to /etc/gss/mech.
  * Add support to the LDAP KDB module for binding to the LDAP server using
    SASL.
  * The KDC listens for TCP connections by default.
  * Fix a minor key disclosure vulnerability where using the "keepold" option
    to the kadmin randkey operation could return the old keys. [CVE-2014-5351]
  * Add client support for the Kerberos Cache Manager protocol. If the host
    is running a Heimdal kcm daemon, caches served by the daemon can be
    accessed with the KCM: cache type.
  * When built on OS X 10.7 and higher, use "KCM:" as the default cache type,
    unless overridden by command-line options or krb5-config values.
  * Add support for doing unlocked database dumps for the DB2 KDC back end,
    which would allow the KDC and kadmind to continue accessing the database
    during lengthy database dumps.
