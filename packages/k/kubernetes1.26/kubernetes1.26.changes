- Update to version 1.26.4:
  * Release commit for Kubernetes v1.26.4
  * releng/go: Update images, dependencies and version to Go 1.19.8
  * Drop development dependencies from test targets
  * Clear front proxy headers after authentication is complete

  * Route controller should update routes with NodeIP changed When a node reboots or kubelet restarts, it is possible that its IP is changed. In this case, node route should be updated with the correct IP. In this PR, it checks if the IP in an existing route is the same as the actual one. If not, it marks it as "update" so the old route will be deleted and a new one will be created. There's a new field EnableNodeAddresses, which is a feature gate for specific cloud providers to enable after they update their cloud provider code for CreateRoute().
