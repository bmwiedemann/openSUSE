  <title>Japanese Handwriting Recognition</title>
  <description>KanjiPad is a very simple program for handwriting recognition. The user
draws a character into the box, then requests translation. The best
candidates are displayed along the right hand side of the window and
can be selected for pasting into other programs.

It is meant primarily for dictionary purposes for learners of Japanese.
It does not support entering kana, so its usefulness as an input method
is limited. Furthermore, if you already know the reading of a
character, conventional pronunciation-based methods of entering the
character are probably faster.

However, KanjiPad is sometimes useful for entering very unusual
characters, even if the pronunciation is known, because
pronunciation-based input methods often fail for rarely used
characters.</description>
