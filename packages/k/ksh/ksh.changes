Tue Jul  8 12:54:51 UTC 2014 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 2014-06-26 of ksh93v- version
  * A bug on some systems in which cd to a directory without execute
    permission would not fail has been fixed.
  * The BASH_SOURCE variable was added when ksh is run in bash mode.
  * The -D and -E options have been added to the complete builtin.
  * References to dgk@research.att.com were deleted.
  * The -l flag to trap and the -p flag to umask were added as in bash.
  * In bash mode ${!parameter} is treated like ${$parameter}.
  * Fixed a bug in which eval inside a dot script invoked by a profile file
    terminated the dot script prematurely after running the eval command.
  * Added parameter expansion operator ${$parameter} for variables and
    positional parameters.
  * Added -a option to read which is equivalent to -A.
  * Fixed a bug in builtin -p.
  * Added -n option to builtin to disable builtins.
  * Fixed a couple of file completion bugs.
  * When compiled with the SHOPT_BASH and run with the name bash,
    the shell now uses dynamic scoping for name() and function name. 
    In addition the builtins declare and local are supported.
    The SHOPT_BASH option is on by default in the Makefile.
    More work remains with the bash compatibility option.
  * Fixed a bug in vi command completion in which tab did not work
    after a space.
  * Replaced the -p option for read with -p prompt.  For backword
    compatibility, if a coprocess is running and prompt begins with -
    or is a valid variable name, -p causes the read from a pipe.
  * Modified the -u option for read and print so that it accepts the
    option argument p to indicate the coprocess file descriptor.

    array has been fixed.
  * A complilation option to add programmable completion with the two
    new builtins, complete and compgen has been added.  It should behave

    problems you find.  Use compgen --man and complete --man to get the
    man pages.  Use the bash documentation for now for information about
    programmable completion.  The compilation is on by default for now.

           and while loops created interactively generate completion messages.
  11-07-20 I fixed a bug in here documents in which multi-byte characters that
           crossed buffer boundaries were not processed correctly.
- Extend workaround for bug in glibc with signbit() macro that is that
  the inlined part for long doubles does not work on IA64
- Extend check for __sync_fetch_and_add gcc builtins for uint64_t, uint16_t,
  and uint8_t to avoid those functions is missed in gcc from older SLES versions
- Avoid to have to large default mimimum region size at an initial memory mapping

  10-08-27 +When running a subshell, the current pool is unset.
  10-08-27 A bug in which jobs started from within for or while lists in

  10-08-11 Restored sh_fmtq() quoting to not quote NAME= in NAME=VALUE.
  10-08-09 +Modified the expansion of message strings, $"...", so that they
           are expanded each time they are referenced rather than expanding
           them when the script is compiled or read in.
  10-08-06 +The process id for jobs in job pools is now of the form poolname.n
           where n is the jobid in that pool.  Commands that accept job names
           or numbers now understand names in this format.
  10-08-05 A bug in which an assignment from within an arithmetic expression
           inside a function would create a local variable has been fixed.
  10-08-04 A bug in the expanding of variables whose names contain multibyte
           characters has been fixed.

           directory.
  10-07-26 A bug in multi-byte locales which the last character of a
           multi-byte character is a \ or pattern character which could occur
           when the character was the last character of a command substitution
           has been fixed.
  10-07-23 Another bug in the processing of ${var:offset;len} in multi-byte
           locales when len is larger than the number of characters has been
           fixed.
  10-07-23 Many coding changes have been made to eliminate most of the uses
           of global variables in the shell code.
  10-07-22 Fixed a bug in which discipline functions were not being invoked
           when it was invoked as ref.discipline where ref was a name reference
           to an array instance.
  10-07-22 Fixed a bug in which discipline functions were not being invoked it
           was invoked on a two dimensional array, i.e., arr[5][9].discipline.
  10-07-19 Fixed a buffering problem which occured when running a script with
           ssh and the parent ssh process is killed.

           of a dynamically loaded function that contained a here document
           could get truncated has been fixed.
  10-06-24 If after executing a script found in FPATH, if a function, builtin,
           or type name corresponding to that script is not defined, the shell
           now outputs an error message and returns value 126.
  10-06-23 Floating point functions that happened to return integer values
           were being treated as if the function returned integers so that
           integer division could be used instead of floating point division.
  10-06-22 Fixed a bug in earlier ksh93u in which an arithmetic assignment to a
           variable in the global scope would instead create a local variable if
           the variable had an attribute but did not have a value.
  10-06-18 Modified trap handling so that if the same signal is received when
           executing the handler, it is deferred until the handler completes.

  10-06-09 Put in patch from Solaris for output quoting with %q.
  10-06-09 +Made changes to the NAMESPACE compile option so that it now seems
           to work.  With this option, namespace <name> { command;} will
           run command in the namespace .name so that all variables and
           functions created by command are accessable outside the name
           space via .name.var and .name.fun.  Variables and functions that
           are not in the namespace are not modifed when runnning command.
  10-06-07 Change most internal interfaces to take Sh_t* argument.
  10-06-03 +Types can be loaded on first reference by putting defintions in PFPATH.
  10-06-03 +The shell is now able to parse commands which use type statements
           before the typeset -T command to define the type executes.

           not properly handle [ and ] in subscripts for associative arrays.
  10-06-02 A bug in which a discipline function defined by a type instance to
           override the default was not being registered has been fixed.

           was not working has been fixed.
  10-06-02 A bug in which the error message for an unset parameter with set -u
           did not contain the name of the variable has been fixed.
  10-06-01 A bug in typeset -m for moving an indexed array instance to a variable
           has been fixed.
  10-06-01 A bug in which caused memory to be freed twice when unset was called
           for an indexed array that had get or set disciplines has been fixed.
  10-06-01 A bug in which the %b format of printf was not preserving NUL bytes
           with \0 has been fixed.

           elements followed by an expansion ${bar.foo[a]} and an assignment
           bar.foo[a]=b, no longer indicates that ${#bar.foo[@]} has 0 members.
  10-04-27 Another bug in which a nested command substitution could hang if it
           generated too much data has been fixed.

  10-04-26 A bug in which types defined in a subshell were not undefined when
           the subshell completed has been fixed.

           variable, could assign value to the type variable rather than to
           the type instance has been fixed.
  10-04-22 A bug in which a nested command substitution could hang if it
           generated too much data has been fixed.

  10-04-06 The optimization that execs the last process of a script rather
           than creating a new process has been removed when a trap on
           interrupt has been set.
  10-04-06 Unsetting the 'C', 'A' or 'a' typeset attribute now produces an
           error message rather than generating an exception.
  10-04-06 A bug in which .sh.name contained the subscript and .sh.subscript
           was empty in some cases with discipline functions on array instances

           numerator was a binary operator with the first operand floating
           point and the second integer, e.g. (.1**3)/3, has been fixed.
  10-03-24 The >; file operator was modified so that the temporary file is
           created in the same physical directory as file.

- Add compiler flags -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks and -fno-tree-vrp
  to avoid miss-compile at least of strdup(ast3) maybe caused by a
  missing volatile modifier
- Update to release 2008-07-25 of ksh93t
  Changes in ksh
  08-07-09  The typeset -C option can be used with arrays to indicate that
            each element should default to a compound variable.
  08-07-08  The %B format now outputs compound variables and arrays.  The
            alternate flag # can be used to cause output into a single line.
  08-06-23  KSH_VERSION added as a name reference to .sh.version.
  08-06-20  type now outputs 'special builtin' for special builtins.
  08-06-16  When typeset -p is followed by variable names, it now displays
            the attributes names and values for the specific names.
  08-06-13  The .sh.lineno variable has been added.  When .sh.level is changed
            inside a DEBUG trap, the .sh.lineno contains the calling line number
            for the specified stack frame.
  08-06-13  The .sh.level variable has been documented and now works.
  08-06-11  The -C option has been added to read for reading compound command
            definitions from a file.
  08-06-11  The . command is now permitted inside a compound command definition.
            The dot script can contain declaration commands and dot commands.
  08-06-09  Add -C option to typeset so that typeset -C foo, is equivalent
            to foo=().
  08-06-09  Added -n warning message for typeset option orderings that are valid
            with ksh88 but not valid with ksh93, for example Lx5.
  08-06-02  When defining a type, the typeset -r attribute causes this field
            to be required to be specified for each instance of the type and
            does not allow a default value.
  08-05-22  The ceil function has been added to the math functions.
  08-05-19  The array expansions ${array[sub1..sub2]} and ${!array[sub1..sub2]}
            to expand to the value (or subscripts) for array between sub1 and
            sub2 inclusive.  For associative arrays, the range is based on
            location in the POSIX locale.  The .. must be explicit and cannot
            result from an expansion.
  08-05-15  The trap on SIGCLD is no longer triggered by the completion of
            the foreground job as with ksh88.
  08-05-12  The unset built-in now returns non-zero when deleting an array
            subscript that is not set.
  08-05-08  Changing the value of HISTFILE or HISTSIZE will cause the old
            history file to be close and reopened with the new name or size.
  08-05-08  When FPATH is changed functions that were found via a path search
            will be searched for again.
  08-05-07  The typeset -S option was added for variables outside type
            definitions to provide a storage class similar to C static
            inside a function defined with function name.
  08-05-01  In multiline edit mode, the refresh operation will now clear
            the remaining portion of the last line.
  08-04-30  The emacs and vi editors have been modified to handle window
            change commands as soon as they happen rather than waiting for
            the next command.
  08-04-04  Choose the name _ as the sub-variable that holds type or instance
            specific data used by discipline functions.
  08-03-20  Associative array assignments of the form ([name]=value ...)
            now allow ; as well as space tab and new line to separate elements.
  08-03-17  --default option added to set(1) to handle set +o POSIX semantics.
            set --state added as a long name alias for set +o.
  08-03-10  The new ${...} command substitution will treat the trailing }
            as a reserved word even if it is not at the beginning of a command,
            for example, ${ date }.
  08-03-10  If the name of the ENV begins with /./ or ././ then the
            /etc/ksh.kshrc file will not be executed on systems that support
            this interactive initialization file.
  08-02-29  The redirection operator >; has been added which for non-special
            files, generates the output in a temporary file and writes the
            specified file only of the command has completed successfully.
  08-02-14  The typeset -a option can now optionally be followed by the name
            of an enumerication type which allows subscripts to be enumerations.
  08-02-14  The enum builtin which creates enumeration types has been added.
  08-02-12  The backoff logic when there are no more processes has been fixed.
  08-02-07  The -X option has been added to typeset.  The -X option creates
            a double precision number that gets displayed using the C99 %a
            format.  It can be used along with -l for long double.
  08-01-31  The -T option to typeset has been added for creating typed
            variables.  Also the -h and -S options have been added to
            typeset that are only applicable when defining a type.
  08-01-31  The prefix expansion operator @ has been added.  ${@name}
            expandes to the type of name or yields the attributes.
  07-09-19  In both emacs and vi edit mode, the escape sequence \E[A (usually
            cursor up, when the cursor is at the end of the line will fetch
            the most recent line starting with the current line.
  07-09-18  The value of ${!var} was correct when var was a reference to an
            array instance.
  07-09-18  The value of ${!var[sub]} was not expanding to var[sub] and this
            was fixed.  It also fixed ${name} where name is a name reference
            to var[sub].
  07-09-18  It is now legal to create a name reference without an initialization.
            It will be bound to a variable on the first assignment.
  07-08-30  A discipline function can be invoked as ${x.foo} and is equivalent
            to ${ x.foo;} and can be invoked as x.foo inside ((...)).
  07-07-03  The command substitution ${ command;} has been added.  It behaves
            like $(command) except that command is executed in the current
            shell environment.  The ${ must be followed by a blank or an
            operator.
