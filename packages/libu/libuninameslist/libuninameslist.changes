- update to 20200505:
    * Version 1.7, Unicode 13.0, French version 1.3 is at Unicode 13.0,
      and including python library wrapper 'uninameslist', version 0.2.
      The French version was updated from version 10.0 to 13.0 shortly
      after Unicode's release - this is a big effort and congratulation
      to the French team! This version updates the main library to also
      include access to libuninameslist-fr. To include this access, you
      need to use './configure --enable-frenchlib'
      This is the first step in adding other languages if anyone wants
      to add more languages.
      The default functions remain as English to retain common grounds
      which is necessary for scripting, and/or file-sharing purposes.
    * Version 1.5, Unicode 12.1, French version 1.2 is at Unicode 10.0.
      Contains Official 12.1 codes.
    * Version 1.4, Unicode 12.1, French version 1.2 is at Unicode 10.0.
      Not completely 12.1.0, created too early before official version
      was announced later in month. This version contains beta 12.1.0d1
    * Version 1.3, Unicode 11.0, French version 1.2 is at Unicode 10.0.
    * Library internal definitions personalized to allow more than one
      library to be loaded at a time. Base library maintains same names
      for backwards compatibility with older programs.
    * Optional python wrapper available for directly accessing library.
      Use python's pip to install wrapper (requires pip and wheel).
    * Unicode 11.0_Beta (Nameslist.txt 11_Beta for review until Apr23).
    * Added Python wrapper and names2 functions.
    * Version 1.2, Unicode 10.0, French version is now also 10.0.0.
    * Added function calls to French version to allow use of one or more
      libraries at the same (Dynamic library linking needs testing since
      added 'FR' may be issue with older programs expecting same name).
    * Added more "make check" to include checking French library.
    * Version 1.1, Unicode 10.0, French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).
    * Added "make check" to allow for automatic library test and verify.
    * Unicode 10.0_Beta (Nameslist.txt 10_Beta for review until Apr30).
    * Version 1.0, Unicode 9.0, French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).
    * Corrected library to report correctly as next version up. This is
      probably a significant change, therefore bumped both libraries to
      start at 1.0 even though backwards compatibility remains the same,
      otherwise would have become version_0.6 (and French version_0.4).
    * Removed the excessively long package name, which you'll note as a
      so-bump change with Fedora and also Debian in naming this package.
    * Version 0.5. Unicode 8.0. French version is 7.0(2014-06-22).
