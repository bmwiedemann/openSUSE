  <title>Lightweight event loop library</title>
  <description>libuEv is a simple event loop in the style of the more established
libevent, libev and the venerable Xt(3) event loop. The u (micro) in the
name refers to both the small feature set and the small size overhead
impact of the library.

Experienced developers may appreciate that libuEv is built on top of
modern Linux APIs: epoll, timerfd and signalfd. Note however, a certain
amount of care is needed when dealing with APIs that employ signalfd.
