- update to version 3.2.7
  * For OpenSSL versions prior to 1, make the 'default' and 'old' hash
    algorithm result the same. This fixes Savannah bug #98997.
  * Do not rebuild the full chain when the CRL is invalidated; also, make
    sure that the invalid CRL object in only deleted when no longer in use.
    Fixes bug #99074.
  * Allow for null fields in the cgi string.
  * Add missing return statement to avoid SEGV during write error recovery
    under certain circumstances. Fixes bug #99002.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  9 10:32:22 UTC 2012 - bugs@vdm-design.de

- update to version 3.2.6
   * GSI authentication: fix possible race condition while re-loading CA
     certificates; fix also related memory leaks.
   * GSI authentication: make sure the CA cache is not initialized twice (e.g.
     server and client inside there), and that the cache entry pointers are
     always initialized.
   * Crypto OpenSSL modules: use more appropriate way to read the RSA complete key,
     solving various issues for RH6 and derivations, included SL(C)6.
   * Make sure redirect opaque information is passed along for all filename
     based requests. This is required for DPM and EOS N2N services to work
     in all cases (most importantly, stat).
   * Make sure buffer ends with null byte before read suspension. This only
     occurs on very heavily loaded connections.
   * Fix the fast response queue so that it doesn't run out of response
     slots causing a big performance penalty. This is a high priority fix.
   * Properly detect external process failure and report correct error status
     to a client.  This also fixes bug report #91141.
   * [XRootDPosix] Make sure to use a supplied cache even when no cache
     directives given.
   * Make sure to return a usable path string via XrdOucCacheIO::Path().
   * Actually support 4 different redirect destinations.
   * Transparent support for new name hashing algorithm adopted in openssl
     1.0.0x (GSI authentication protocol)
   * Verbosity levels revised for GSI and PWD authentication protocols.
   * Notification of initialization option for GSI and PWD authentication
     protocols.
   * Do not repudiate file existence on an "cancelled" error during open.
     this patch addresses overloaded dCache pool nodes.

   * Make sure refresh thread is dead before deleting deleting the keytab to
     avoid SEGV's.
   * Add missing include for compiling with gcc-4.7 (from Sebastien Binet).
     This patch is required for successful compilation.
   * Avoid segfaults when limiting number of redirections caused by failed
     authorization.
   * Avoid deadlock in the client fork handlers.
   * Correct monitor initialization test to start monitor under all configs.

   * Prevent SEGV when xrd.monitor rbuff value not specified
   * Prevent xrdcp hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * In case of 'limited proxy' look for VOMS attributes also in the parent
     proxy.
   * Correct log processing for sites that use the root directory as the
     stomping ground for newly created files.
