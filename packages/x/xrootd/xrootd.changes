- Only build python bindings without private copies of the client
  library. This also removes the ambiguity for the client libraries
  for the automatic dependency generation.
- Only use build dependency on doxygen/graphviz for the main
  package.
- Remove unused swig build dependency.
- Various spec file cleanups
- Fix installation of API docs

Thu Jun 15 16:44:16 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Fix some multibuild package name degeneracies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 17:26:19 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.5.5:
  * [HTTP] Initialize SecEntity.addrInfo to avoid SEGV
    (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1986).
  * [Server] Allow XrdXrootdFile::Serialize() to be used to wait
    more than once (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1995).
  * [Server] Correct file handle returned when reusing it from
    external table.
  * [XrdCl] Fix client crash on early closed connection
    (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1934).
  * [Server] Use correct format to print size_t
    (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1989).
  * [XrdApps] Let XrdClProxyPlugin work with PgRead
    (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1993).
  * [XrdCl] Avoid possibility of Channel unregistering the wrong
    task (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1883).
  * [XrdCl] Fix ZipArchive issuing VectorWrite which is too large
    during CloseArchive (gh#xrootd/xrootd#2004).
  * [XrdSys] Avoid memory leak when overwriting the default
    message for EBADE.
  * [CMake] Adjust build rules to not depend on scitokenscpp to
    build libXrdSecztn.

    compiler.
  * [XrdPosix] Fix build with Clang and _FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled
    (gh#xrootd/xrootd#1975).
- Fix python builds:
  * Add xrootd-modernize-python-builds.patch: patch from
    gh#xrootd/xrootd#2025 rebased for current version.
  * Use _multibuild to split out python builds into own flavour
    separate from main package builds.
  * Manually create a VERSION file so that dist-infos can decipher
    the right version and does not use 5.6-rc-foo; this should no
    longer be required when packaging tagged version 5.6.
  * Manually specify xrootd includedirs when building python pkgs
    since cmake as invoked by python build tools does not
    automatically inherit them, leading to missing header
    complaints.
  * Pass -Wno-error=odr to linker flags to avoid build failures on
    32bit archs (gh#xrootd/xrootd#2032).

  xrootd-gcc6-fix.patch
  Patch taken from https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-8184
  Fix is included in upstream version 4.3.0. We do not update to
  this version, as other packages that use xrootd do not compile
  against versions >= 4.0
- Fixes bnc#985167

- Update to version 3.3.4
   * Serialize sss authentication client initialization to prevent race
     conditions
   * Actually cancel the JobManager threads while stopping it - this affected
     client side fork handling (new client)
   * Restore original meaning of -adler and -md5 to xrdcp (issue #44)
   * Append CGI info when retrying at a server that handshaked but never
     respnded to the request (xrdcp)
   * Do socket accepts asynchronously to prevent DNS resolution from blocking
     accepts (issue #33)
   * Warn about incomplete dirlist responses (xrdfs)
   * Cast the utilization statistics to uint16_t before printing to
     print actual numbers instead of letters corresponding to ASCII codes
     (xrdfs)
   * When calling File::Stat use file handle instead of path
   * Improve handling of malformed kXR_readv responses (new client)
   * Explain parameters of xrdcopy --tpc (documentation, issue #46)

- add libperl_requires, as we link against libperl and thus
  need a specific version of perl

- Update to version 3.3.2
    * Fix the opaque information setting in xrdcp using -OD (issue #1)
    * Fix compilation on Solaris 11 (issue #7)
    * Fix issues with semaphore locking during thread cancelation on MaxOSX (issue #10)
    * Solve locking problems in the built-in poller (issue #4)
    * Solve performance issues in the new client. Note: this actually changes some low level public interfaces, so the soname of libXrdCl.so has been bumped to libXrdCl.so.1. The xrootd.org RPMs also provide the old libXrdCl.so.0 in order to preserve the binary compatibility with the clients linked against it.

- update to version 3.3.1
   * Correct XrdClient ABI incompatibility issue introduced in 3.3.0
   * Install additional private headers

- update to version 3.2.7
  * For OpenSSL versions prior to 1, make the 'default' and 'old' hash
    algorithm result the same. This fixes Savannah bug #98997.
  * Do not rebuild the full chain when the CRL is invalidated; also, make
    sure that the invalid CRL object in only deleted when no longer in use.
    Fixes bug #99074.
  * Allow for null fields in the cgi string.
  * Add missing return statement to avoid SEGV during write error recovery
    under certain circumstances. Fixes bug #99002.

- update to version 3.2.6
   * GSI authentication: fix possible race condition while re-loading CA
     certificates; fix also related memory leaks.
   * GSI authentication: make sure the CA cache is not initialized twice (e.g.
     server and client inside there), and that the cache entry pointers are
     always initialized.
   * Crypto OpenSSL modules: use more appropriate way to read the RSA complete key,
     solving various issues for RH6 and derivations, included SL(C)6.
   * Make sure redirect opaque information is passed along for all filename
     based requests. This is required for DPM and EOS N2N services to work
     in all cases (most importantly, stat).
   * Make sure buffer ends with null byte before read suspension. This only
     occurs on very heavily loaded connections.
   * Fix the fast response queue so that it doesn't run out of response
     slots causing a big performance penalty. This is a high priority fix.
   * Properly detect external process failure and report correct error status
     to a client.  This also fixes bug report #91141.
   * [XRootDPosix] Make sure to use a supplied cache even when no cache
     directives given.
   * Make sure to return a usable path string via XrdOucCacheIO::Path().
   * Actually support 4 different redirect destinations.
   * Transparent support for new name hashing algorithm adopted in openssl
     1.0.0x (GSI authentication protocol)
   * Verbosity levels revised for GSI and PWD authentication protocols.
   * Notification of initialization option for GSI and PWD authentication
     protocols.
   * Do not repudiate file existence on an "cancelled" error during open.
     this patch addresses overloaded dCache pool nodes.

   * Propagate to clients proper range of errors during read/write operations
   * Fix segfault when handling writes to files that have not been opened

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 3.2.3
   * Make sure read statistics are updated for sendfile() and mmap I/O.
   * Make sure refresh thread is dead before deleting deleting the keytab to
     avoid SEGV's.
   * Add missing include for compiling with gcc-4.7 (from Sebastien Binet).
     This patch is required for successful compilation.
   * Avoid segfaults when limiting number of redirections caused by failed
     authorization.
   * Avoid deadlock in the client fork handlers.
   * Correct monitor initialization test to start monitor under all configs.
   * Fix a memory leak in the client handshake algorithm.
   * Fuse: Use default TTL values for data server connection and load
     balance server connection.

- update to version 3.2.2
   * Correct test whether or not to initialize redirect monitoring. The old
     code never initialized it this disabling redirect monitoring.
   * Backport frm notification fix that stalled stage-in requests from commit
     69e38cfd6b8bb024dd34f8eb28a666fbf97f346b
   * Prevent SEGV when xrd.monitor rbuff value not specified
   * Prevent xrdcp hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * In case of 'limited proxy' look for VOMS attributes also in the parent
     proxy.
   * Correct log processing for sites that use the root directory as the
     stomping ground for newly created files.
