  * Suppress high-keycode warnings at the default warning level
  * xkbcomp Fix missing support for "affect" and incorrect modifier
    handling for ISOLock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  8 10:40:35 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4.2
  * Only one patch, fixing keymap compilation errors when the
    keycodes maximum is set to a value above the permitted X11
    maximum of 255. While we already ignored keys with codes
    above 255, we still failed on the maximum=374; line that 
    xkeyboard-config 2.24 produces now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 14:58:54 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4.1
  * This release adds the path of the xkbcomp executable to the pkgconfig
    data, allowing the X server to find the right binary regardless of
    where its (the X servers) $prefix is pointed. Without this the X server
    will guess that xkbcomp is configured for the same prefix; since the
    default prefix is /usr/local, and your distribution certainly did not
    install xkbcomp there, 'make check' and 'ninja dist' for the X server
    build would fail because Xvfb would not start.
- supersedes U_xkbcomp_pkgconfig-add-bindir.patch
- refreshed xkbcomp.keyring; seems signing key changed, since this
  time the package has been released by Adam Jackson (before: Daniel
  Stone)? Hope I got this right ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 20 22:42:36 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add U_xkbcomp_pkgconfig-add-bindir.patch: pkgconfig: Add our
  bindir to xkbcomp.pc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  2 12:21:16 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * This xkbcomp release mostly contains a couple of bugfixes and
    parser improvements. Notably, ignoring keycodes that X11 can
    never support means that we can start using those keycodes,
    which xkbcommon supports.
- refreshed xkbcomp.keyring; seems signing key changed, since this
  time the package has been released by Daniel Stone (before: Peter
  Hutterer)? Hope I got this right ...

Fri Nov 13 12:27:11 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Use url for source
- Add gpg signature
- Make building more verbose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 13:07:25 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.3.1
  * Couple of minor fixes, the only user-visible change is that the
    warning when a key type is shortened is now on a verbosity level
    above the default verbosity. This effectively removes the warning
    below for all users of the german keyboard layout (and others):
    Type "ONE_LEVEL" has 1 levels, but <RALT> has 2 symbols

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 29 21:50:44 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.3.0:
  + Support for multiple keysyms per level (#25025).
  + Misc fixes and changes all over the place.
  + UNIXOS2 support was dropped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 11 08:45:25 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Split the pkg-config file in a devel subpackage, instead of
  removing it: it might be needed by some configure scripts.
- Remove xkbcomp-devel Provides from main subpackage now that we
  have a proper devel subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 11 08:22:43 UTC 2012 - coolo@suse.com

- remove the pkgconfig file - it requires all devel packages and
  nothing of that is needed to run xkbcomp

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 26 18:40:02 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Version the Provides for xkbcomp-devel, as it can be useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 21:23:30 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.4:
  + Delete redundant redeclarations of extern Atoms in symbols.c
  + Make sure to leave room for trailing nil byte in yyGetNumber
  + include resets group compatibility modifiers fdo#43091
  + Correct our zeroing out of the row in InitRowInfo
  + Add missing _X_NORETURN to uFatalError
  + Add .pc file for version export
  + Print version number on -version.
  + Build system fixes.
- Changes from version 1.2.3:
  + Interp: Allow explicit Any/NoSymbol mappings
  + Constify LookupKeysym input argument
- Changes from version 1.2.2:
  + Interp: Ignore NoSymbol definitions
  + Interp: Don't make modifier lookup failure fatal
  + Replace repeated checks for gcc with _X_ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF from
    xproto
  + xkbcomp: Stop possible overflow in yyGetnumber. fdo#31647
  + Inline the oiText macro in the only place it's used
  + Build system fixes.
- Changes from version 1.2.1:
  + Build system fixes.
- Add pkgconfig(xproto) BuildRequires: new dependency.
- Provide xkbcomp-devel from the main-package. This is a compiler,
  and as such per definition a -devel tool. This helps to silence
  a rpmlint warning, as we now also have a .pc file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 13 08:46:08 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Split xkbcomp from xorg-x11. Initial version: 1.2.0.
