because the original program does not have a manual page.

.B XMMS2 
is a redesign of the XMMS (http://www.xmms.org) music player. It features a
client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces,
both textual and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using
plug-ins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organize your
music.
.PP
.B xmms2-ripper
is visualization client for
.B XMMS2.
Instead of visualizing the audio data, it encodes the data to Ogg/Vorbis and
writes them to the standard output. The output should be redirected to a file
or to another program.
.SH OPTIONS
