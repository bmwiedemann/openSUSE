  <title>A modular audio framework and plugin architecture</title>
  <description>XMMS2 is an audio framework, but it is not a general multimedia player - it 
will not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for 
audio processing, visualisation and output, but this framework has not been 
designed to support video. Also the client-server design of XMMS2 (and the 
daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents direct 
video output being implemented. It has support for a wide range of audio 
formats, which is expandable via plugins. It includes a basic CLI interface 
to the XMMS2 framework, but most users will want to install a graphical XMMS2 
client (such as gxmms2 or esperanza).</description>
