Wed Apr  2 17:28:27 CEST 2008 - sbrabec@suse.cz

- Updated to version 5.05:
  * New hacks, `cubicgrid', `hypnowheel', and `lcdscrub' (which
    isn't really a screen saver).
  * Updates to `m6502' and `gears'.
  * Fixed double-buffering problems in `cubestorm' and `noof'.
  * Better handling of horizontal scroll wheels.
  * Attempt to work around latest Xinerama braindamage: if the
    server reports overlapping screens, use the largest
    non-overlapping rectangles available.
  * Don't warning about receipt of bogus ClientMessages, since
    Gnome's just never going to stop sending those.
  * The recent PAM changes broke the "Caps Lock" warning in the
    password dialog, the failed login warnings, and syslogging.
    Fixed all that.
