  <title>X11 Editor with C/C++/Java Browser and lots more ;)</title>
  <description>Half of the YaST developers swear on it, not only because of the built
in C/C++/Java browser. Xcoral provides support for the work with C,
C++, Java, Perl, Ada, and Fortran programs and for the creation of
LaTeX and HTML documents. With the help of the built in 'SMall Ansi C
Interpreter' (SMAC), xcoral can be configured and extended in almost
arbitrary ways. Examples can be found in the directory /usr/lib/xcoral.

Further information about Xcoral and SMAC is available in the detailed
online help system (also available Postscript format).</description>
