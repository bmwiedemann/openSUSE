%description
Xcoral provides support for working with C, C++, Java, Perl, Ada, and
Fortran programs and for the creation of LaTeX and HTML documents.
With the help of the built-in "SMall Ansi C Interpreter" (SMAC),
xcoral can be configured and extended in almost arbitrary ways.
Examples can be found in the directory %{_prefix}/lib/xcoral. It has
a built-in C/C++/Java browser

Further information about Xcoral and SMAC is available in the detailed
online help system (also available Postscript format).
