  <title>A Fast Picture Viewer for the X Window System</title>
  <description>Xzgv is a picture viewer for the X Window System with a thumbnail-based
file selector. It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported,
and the thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It
can also be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file
selector. For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv'
or `man xzgv' once it is installed.</description>
