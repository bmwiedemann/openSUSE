  <title>Power Management for the Xfce Desktop Environment</title>
  <description>xfce4-power-manager is a tool for the Xfce desktop environment for managing
profiles of policies which affect power consumption, such as the display
brightness level, display sleep times, or CPU frequency scaling. It can also
trigger actions on certain events such as closing the lid or reaching low
battery levels and provides a set of interfaces to inform other applications
about current power level so that they can adjust their power consumption.
Furthermore, it provides a standardized inhibit interface which allows
applications to prevent automatic sleep actions via the power manager.</description>
