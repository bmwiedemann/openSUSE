  <title>A Validating XML Parser</title>
  <description>Xerces-C is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
C++. Xerces-C makes it easy to give your application the ability to
read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. Xerces-C is
faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards ( DOM
1.0, DOM 2.0. SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces).</description>
