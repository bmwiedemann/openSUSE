%description
This is xwmfs (X window manager file system), a userspace file system based on
fuse that allows interaction with an EWMH compliant X11 window manager via
files.

Some of its features are:

- newly appearing and disappearing windows in the X server are recognized and
  the file system is updated in an event based manner
- new values for properties of window manager and windows will be reflected in
  the file system in an event based manner
- properties of windows and window manager can be changed via writing to files
  in the file system
- some X operations are accessible via control files in the file system
- the file system can be used for easily implementing scripts that operate on
  the window manager and windows (for example identifying specific windows,
  rename a window, move it around and so on).
