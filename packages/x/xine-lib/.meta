  <description>xine is a free multimedia player. It plays back CDs, DVDs, and VCDs. It
also decodes multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3 from local
disk drives, and displays multimedia streamed over the Internet. It
interprets many of the most common multimedia formats available - and
some of the most uncommon formats, too.</description>
