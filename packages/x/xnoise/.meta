  <title>Amarok-like media player for Gtk+ with a smooth GUI and lots of features</title>
  <description>Xnoise uses a tracklist centric design like Amarok, Clementine, Exaile.
The tracklist is a list of video or music tracks that are played one by one without being removed (right side of window). This gives you the possibility to enqueue any track in any order, regardless if they are on the same album or
not. The tracks can be reordered at any time via drag and drop.

The media browser (left side of the window) contains all available media in a hierarchical tree structure of the available metadata. It is easy to find a single track, artist or album by going through this tree or by just entering a
search term. From the media browser, music or videos can be dragged into the tracklist to every position.

Single or multiple tracks, streams, albums or artists can be dragged onto the tracklist and be reordered. Within the playing track, it's possible to jump to every position by clicking the position bar.

Xnoise can play every kind of audio/video data that GStreamer can handle.</description>
