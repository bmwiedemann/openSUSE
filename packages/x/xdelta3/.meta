  <description>Xdelta3 is a set of tools designed to compute changes between binary files.  These changes (delta files) are similar to the output of the &quot;diff&quot; program, in that they may be used to store and transmit only the changes between files.  The &quot;delta files&quot; that Xdelta3 manages are stored in RFC3284 (VCDIFF) format.</description>
