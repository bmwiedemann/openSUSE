    <comment>This package adds a script to download the firmware for Microsoft's Xbox One Controllers. It is required for a specialized driver called &quot;xone&quot;. xone is required to support the audio interface of xbox type controllers and its wireless dongle.
Submitting this package to allow installation of the xone package which I will add to regular Factory when this is accepted.

This package is only a download script that presents the TOS of Microsoft during installation. It follows how this package works, the use cases are very similar/identical: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/fetchmsttfonts</comment>
