    <comment>This package adds a script to download the firmware for Microsoft's Xbox One Controllers. It is required for a specialized driver called &quot;xone&quot;. xone is required to support the audio interface of xbox type controllers and its wireless dongle.
Submitting this package to allow installation of the xone package which I will add to regular Factory when this is accepted.

This package is only a download script that presents the TOS of Microsoft during installation. It follows how this package works, the use cases are very similar/identical: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/fetchmsttfonts</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0+git20251208.d8be599:
  - Update to new firmware file locations
  - Make version linked to upstream firmware donwload script

I moved away from the SUSE install script macro and mechanism since it writes to /var - which isn't mounted on transactional systems during transactional-update, see https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/transactional-update-guide/tu-setup.html#tu-setup-var
and
https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_for_transactional-updates#Files_in_/var
where it's recommended to place the files in /usr/share instead - so I did. The script itself lives in _libexecdir, I guess that's the correct location for the download script.
If there's another solution, please let me know :)

This should be accepted together with the new xone version, which changed the firmware paths requiring this update.</comment>
