    versions earlier than 2.6.31 (Sept. 2009).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 12:09:31 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

Thu May 28 09:08:26 UTC 2020 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- devel package: removed requires to main package, since it's not
  required at all for development (boo#1172153)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 30 12:12:53 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

-  move xorg.conf.d snippet from /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d to
  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d (boo#1139692)

-  Update to version 1.9.1:
   * A few build system janitorial things, a compatibility patch
     by Luca and one patch to avoid log spam when the device goes
     away (and before udev tells us that it's gone).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 30 08:45:18 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- includes everything needed for missing sle issue entries:
  fate #315643-315645, 319159-319161, 319618 (bsc#1041556) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 19 16:54:08 UTC 2016 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  This release supports the X server 1.19.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 23:46:11 UTC 2016 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.8.99.2:
  + Remove upstream patch U_conf-rename-to-70-synaptics.conf.patch
  + Adapt n_xf86-input-synaptics-wait.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 23 08:57:47 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- replaced n_conf-rename-to-70-synaptics.conf.patch with upstreamed
  patch U_conf-rename-to-70-synaptics.conf.patch (boo #979554)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 15:19:21 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- n_conf-rename-to-70-synaptics.conf.patch
  * bump up synaptics driver to 70, so it get's preferred over
    libinput, which was dropped down to 060 (boo #979554)
- adjusted n_xf86-input-synaptics-default-tap.diff,
  n_xf86-input-synaptics-xorg.conf.d_snippet.diff
- removed Supplements: xorg-x11-server, so the driver no longer
  gets installed by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 11:54:34 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Add gpg signature
- Make building more verbose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 10:32:29 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.8.3
  * With Gabriele's fix, the order of fingers on the touchpad doesn't
    matter for two-finger scrolling. Previously, only one of the
    fingers would trigger scroll events. See 
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92622

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 31 07:48:13 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Ignore absence of udevadm, it won't be present in the build env.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 08:54:38 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.8.2:
  * One significant change here: an artificial delay is now used
    between the button events of a doubletap. Some applications
    previously dropped the events because they had the same
    timestamp, with the delay this should now work fine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 21 17:23:27 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.8.1:
  A couple of coverity-induced fixes, the
  top software buttons are now 15% and better detection of two-finger
  taps. A couple of misc other fixes, the only oddity in there is a
  fix for clock drift - if you had clickpad clicks delayed by a
  second or so after a number of suspend/resume cycles then you may
  want to upgrade to this version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 13 12:03:22 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.8.0 
  * final release; changes since 1.7.99.2: 
    + conf: drop the PNPID matching from the fdi file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  7 10:36:16 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.99.2
  * The second snapshot for synaptics 1.8 is now available. Note
    that there are are two significant changes:
    - the event device is not grabbed anymore. In some setups this
      may lead to duplicate events but where it does you're really
      better off using an InputClass instead of an InputDevice
      section in your xorg.conf.
    - the secondary software button area (i.e. the top software
      buttons on the Lenovo *40 series) is now automatically
      enabled based on the INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD property,
      slated for kernel 3.15. No more PNPID matching in the
      snippets, which didn't work without a kernel patch anyway.
      If you can't update the kernel, use Option
      "HasSecondarySoftButtons" "on".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 17 23:01:38 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.7.99.1:
 - libevdev support:
    The evdev backend on Linux now uses libevdev. We recommend
    to use libevdev 1.1-rc1 or later as the synaptics driver is
    very likely to trigger SYN_DROPPED and we've fixed a bunch
    of issues in libevdev 1.1.
 - Support for T440, T540, X240, Helix, Yoga:
   The bulk of the changes is to support this set of Lenovo
   touchpads. These touchpads don't have separate physical
   buttons for the trackstick and need to be emulated as
   software-button by the driver.
 - TouchpadOff behaviour change:
   Synaptics has a property "Synaptics Off" to disable events.
   Previously, this disabled any event from the touchpad.
   Now, physical button clicks are allowed even when the
   touchpad is disabled.
 - mtdev was dropped:
   There are no touchpad drivers in the kernel tree that
   use protocol A, so using mtdev is just a computationally
   expensiv and memory-wasting noop.
- As per upstream change, swap pkgconfig(mtdev) BuildRequires for
  pkgconfig(evdev) >= 1.0.99.1
- Rebase n_xf86-input-synaptics-wait.diff for this release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 12 14:55:34 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.4:
  One fix: closing the fd again if the device cannot be enabled
  properly, and two reverts: scrollbuttons and circular pad
  support are making a comeback. Apparently there are still a
  few laptops out there that require either feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 14:09:01 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- n_xf86-input-synaptics-xorg.conf.d_snippet.diff: disable
  "HorizEdgeScroll" instead of setting "HorizScrollDelta" to 0
  (bnc#864664, fdo#75074)
- adapted n_xf86-input-synaptics-default-tap.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 11:26:25 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.3
  * Just one fix for the stable branch, fixing the #define for
    server 1.15 (and newer). A bad ABI detection check enabled
    driver scaling on input ABI 20, causing sluggish pointer
    behaviour.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  9 22:23:05 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.2:
  Three patches on top of the previous release, the first of which
  enables proper driver scaling when running against new servers. If
  you're using the server from git, both driver and server would
  scale, resulting in a sluggish touchpad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  2 10:10:47 UTC 2013 - eich@suse.com

- renamed:
  * xf86-input-synaptics-xorg.conf.d_snippet.diff ->
     n_xf86-input-synaptics-xorg.conf.d_snippet.diff
  * xf86-input-synaptics-wait.diff ->
     n_xf86-input-synaptics-wait.diff
  * xf86-input-synaptics-default-tap.diff ->
     n_xf86-input-synaptics-default-tap.diff
  to indicate that these are SUSE specific patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 14 14:46:30 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.1:
  First stable update to synaptics 1.7 is now available.
- User-visible changes:
  + soft button areas may overlap on the edge, so a configuration of
    e.g.middle button 33%-66% and right button 66%-0 is now valid.
  + man page fix to avoid confusion between 0 and 0% on button configuration 
  This release also includes the fix for stack smash caused by Apple
  MagicTrackpads.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  2 12:26:46 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.0:
  This release has seen a bunch of purges in the hope that it will make the
  code more maintainable. Most of the features dropped are expected to have
  few or no users, or hardware that hasn't been around for ages.

  Most other fixes have found their way into the 1.6 branch already.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 10:10:06 UTC 2013 - sndirsch@suse.com

- xf86-input-synaptics 1.6.3
  * Compared to 1.6.2, we've had a memory leak fixed, better
    behaviour for synaptics soft buttons and, most importantly,
    a fix to reset the touch state after suspend.
- obsoletes xf86-input-synaptics-Reset-num_active_touches-on-DeviceOff-52496.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 19 09:30:29 UTC 2013 - tchvatal@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 11 07:51:22 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6.1:
  + Fix wrong conversion causing coasting to be triggered on almost
    all scroll events.
  + Fix bug where, on clickpads, moving the clicking finger out of
    the soft button area caused erroneous button events.
