  <title>Utilities for managing the XFS file system</title>
  <description>A set of commands to use the XFS file system, including mkfs.xfs.

XFS is a high performance journaling file system which originated on
the SGI IRIX platform.	It is completely multithreaded. It can support
large files and large file systems, extended attributes, and variable
block sizes.It is extent based and makes extensive use of Btrees
(directories, extents, and free space) to aid both performance and
scalability.

Refer to the documentation at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/ for
complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible with the
IRIX version of XFS.</description>
