    <version>0.6.2</version>
    <time>1525779400</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.6.2:
 * Added:
  * Release tarballs now include licenses and minimal documentation for xonsh and ply
  * Wizard now has a FileInserter node that allows blocks to be inserted and replaced inside of a file. This adheres to conversion rules fordumping as provided on this node.
  * New xonsh.wizard.StateVisitor.flatten() method for flattening the current state.
 * Changed:
  * The xonsh startup wizard will only be triggered if no xonshrc files exist and the file ~/.local/config/xonsh/no-wizard is not present.
  * The xonfig wizard command will now run write out to the xonshrc file.
  * Wizard nodes Save and Load had their names changed to SaveJSON and LoadJSON.
 * Removed:
  * Static configuration is dead (config.json), long live run control (xonshrc)!
  * The following evironment variables have been removed as they are no longer needed: $LOADED_CONFIG and $XONSHCONFIG.
  * Many support functions for static configuration have also been removed.
 * Fixed:
  * Files starting with # are auto-escaped by TAB completion
- update to version 0.6.1:
 * Added:
  * Support for MSYS2.
  * New ``xonsh.main.setup()`` function for starting up xonsh in 3rd party
    packages.
 * Changed:
  * Updated CircleCI to use circle version 2.0
  * Replaced StopIteration with return in CommandPipeline.iterraw.
  * Xonsh run control now also looks for the XDG-compliant file
    ``~/.config/xonsh/rc.xsh`` at startup.
 * Fixed:
  * Clean out ``$LINES`` and ``$COLUMNS`` if set, preventing some programs from drawing weirdly
  * cat from xoreutils now outputs in configured encoding
  * Fixed hanging issue with pipelines whose middle processes exit before the
    first or last process.
  * Fixed issue where xonsh would deduplicate spaces from bash autocompletions.
  * Fixed failing redirections from stderr to stdout when the command
    being executed was a callable alias.
  * Ensure that the ``free_cwd`` contrib can only be active on pure Windows.
  * Made an exceptional case in ``iglobpath()`` more robust when Python globbing
    fails for due to strange scrandir issue.
  * Unexpected process suspension on Cygwin and MSYS2.
  * ``$XONSH_APPEND_NEWLINE`` will now default to True when in interactive mode.
  * Fixed issue with uncalled lambdas being run in subproc mode.
  * Lambda nodes not have proper line and column numbers in AST.
  * Properly throw ``SyntaxError`` when no kwargs are defined
    in a kwarg-only function. This used to throw a
    ``TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable``.
  * Addressed issue where encoding and errors were None when teeing output.
  * Commands like ``git c`` would complete to ``git 'checkout '`` because git adds an extra space
    to the end of the completion, which was being captured in the completion. Xonsh now fixes the git issue
    while retaining all whitespace when there is other internal whitespace.

    <time>1526023148</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.6.3:
 * Added:
  * Docs for using ``@(&lt;expr&gt;)`` as a way to run commands and a gotcha about
    list of strings vs single string expressions.
  * Ubuntu versions which xonsh is packaged for (with xonsh versions)
 * Changed:
  * When reporting errors without a traceback (i.e. ``$XONSH_SHOW_TRACEBACK = False``) and the error is a ``XonshError``
    the exception type is not longer printed.
  * ``CommandPipeline.proc`` may now be ``None``, to accomodate when the process
    fails to even start (i.e. a missing command or incorrect permisions).
 * Fixed:
  * The ``curl`` command will now be run in a thread, which prevents documents that
    do not end in a newline from writing over the next prompt and vice versa.
  * Fix bug on Windows when ``PATHEXT`` environment variable did not exist.
    This also fixes building the xonsh documentation on Windows.
  * Fixed a bug in the `free_cwd &lt;http://xon.sh/xontribs.html#free-cwd&gt;`__ Windows Xontrib, which caused the prompt to error if the current directory is 
    deleted/renamed from an other process.
  * Fixed issue with ``$XONSH_SHOW_TRACEBACK`` not being respected in subprocess
    mode when the command could not be found or had incorrect permissions.

    <version>0.7.7</version>
    <time>1537787610</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.7.7:
 - Added:
  - A xontrib which adds support for autojump to xonsh
  - Added new env-var ``XONSH_HISTORY_MATCH_ANYWHERE``. If set to ``True`` then
    up-arrow history matching will match existing history entries with the search
    term located anywhere, not just at the beginning of the line. Default value is
    ``False``
 - Changed:
  - Improved iteration over virtual environments in Vox.__iter__
 - Fixed:
  - Fix for ``Enter`` not returning from Control-R search buffer
  - Fixed automatic wrapping of many subprocesses that spanned multiple lines via
    line continuation characters with logical operators separating the commands.
    For example, the following now works:
    .. code-block:: sh
          echo 'a' \
          and echo 'b'
  - Environment swapping would not properly reraise errors due to weird
    Python name binding issue.
- update to version 0.7.6:
 - Added:
  - Callable aliases may now accept a ``stack`` argument. If they do, then the
    stack, as computed from the aliases call site, is provided as a list of
    ``FrameInfo`` objects (as detailed in the standard library ``inspect``
    module). Otherwise, the ``stack`` parameter is ``None``.
  - ``SubprocSpec`` now has a ``stack`` attribute, for passing the call stack
    to callable aliases. This defaults to ``None`` if the spec does not
    need the stack. The ``resolve_stack()`` method computes the ``stack``
    attribute.
 - Changed:
  - xonsh/environ.py
    Exceptions are caught in the code executed under Env.swap()
 - Fixed:
  - Scripts are now cached by their realpath, not just abspath.
  - Fixed a potential crash (``AssertionError: wrong color format``) on Python 3.5 and prompt_toolkit 1.
  - The ``completer`` command now correctly finds completion functions
    when nested inside of other functions.
  - Fixed a crash when using the ``$XONSH_STDERR_PREFIX/POSTFIX`` with
    prompt_toolkit and Pygments 2.2.
- update to version 0.7.5:
 - Fixed:
  - Recent command history in ptk2 prompt now returns most recently executed
    commands first (as expected)
  - Fixed a regression taat prevented the readline backend from beeing used. This
    regression was caused by the new ansi-color names, which are incompatible with
    pygments 2.2.
- update to version 0.7.4:
 - Added:
  - New ``xonsh-cat`` command line utility, which is a xonsh replacement
    for the standard UNIX ``cat`` command.
  - The new ``xonsh.xoreutils.cat.cat_main()`` enables the ``xonsh.xoreutils.cat``
    module to be run as a command line utility.
  - New ``CommandsCache.is_only_functional_alias()`` and
    ``CommandsCache.lazy_is_only_functional_alias()`` methods for determining if
    if a command name is only implemented as a function, and thus has no
    underlying binary command to execute.
  - ``xonsh.xontribs.xontribs_load()`` is a new first-class API for loading
    xontribs via a Python function.
  - ``$COMPLETIONS_DISPLAY`` now supports readline-like behavior on
    prompt-toolkit v2.
 - Changed:
  - The xonsh Jupyter kernel now will properly redirect the output of commands
    such as ``git log``, ``man``, ``less`` and other paged commands to the client.
    This is done by setting ``$PAGER = 'cat'``. If ``cat`` is not available
    on the system, ``xonsh-cat`` is used instead.
  - The ``setup()`` function for starting up a working xonsh has ``aliases``,
    ``xontribs``, and ``threadable_predictors`` as new additional keyword
    arguments for customizing the loading of xonsh.
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed a bug with converting new PTK2 colors names to old names when using PTK1 or Jupyter
      as the shell type.
  - ``CommandsCache.locate_binary()`` will now properly return None when
    ``ignore_alias=False`` and the command is only a functional alias,
    such as with ``cd``. Previously, it would return the name of the
    command.
  - Fixed issue with ``$COMPLETIONS_DISPLAY`` raising an error on
    prompt-toolkit v2 when the value was not set to ``multi``.
  - ValueError when executing ``vox list``

    <version>0.8.1</version>
    <time>1541666910</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.8.1
 - Added:
  - ``SubprocSpec`` has a new ``pipeline_index`` integer attribute that indicates
    the commands position in a pipeline. For example, in
    .. code-block:: sh
      p = ![ls -l | grep x]
    The ``ls`` command would have a pipeline index of 0
    (``p.specs[0].pipeline_index == 0``) and ``grep`` would have a pipeline index
    of 1 (``p.specs[1].pipeline_index == 1``).  This may be usefule in callable
    alaises which recieve the spec as an argument.
 - Changed:
  - Removed ``fish`` from list of supported foreign shells in the wizard.
  - Circle CI config updated to use a pinned version of ``black`` (18.9b0)
  - Pytest plugin now uses ``xonsh.main.setup()`` to setup test environment.
  - Linux platform discovery will no longer use ``platform.linux_distribution()``
    on Python &gt;=3.6.6. due to pending deprecation warning.
  - Updated Linux Guide as Xonsh is now available in Arch Linux official repositories.
 - Fixed:
  - Builtin dynamic proxies and deprecation warning proxies were not deleting
    attributes and items properly.
  - Fixed stdout/sdterr writing infinite recurssion error that would occur in
    long pipelines of callable aliases.
  - Fixed a bug which under very rare conditions could cause the shell
    to die with PermissionError exception while sending SIGSTOP signal
    to a child process.
  - Fixed further raw string deprecation warnings thoughout the code base.
- update to version 0.8.0
 - Added:
- changelog.sh is an internal script for generating changelog.</comment>

    <version>0.8.8</version>
    <time>1548335661</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to version 0.8.8
 - Added:
  - ``vox new`` has an added ``-p --interpreter`` flag for choosing the python interpreter to use for virtualenv creation
  - The default Python intrepreter vox uses to create virtual environments can be set using the ``$VOX_DEFAULT_INTERPRETER`` environment variable.
 - Changed:
  - ``lib.ChainDB`` now resolves results to the type of the inputs if possible
- update to version 0.8.7
 - Added:
  - New xonsh syntax ``pf`` strings -- combining path strings with f-strings.
    Usage:
    .. code-block:: bash
         gil@bad_cat ~ $ repos = 'github.com'
         gil@bad_cat ~ $ pf&quot;~/{repos}&quot;
         PosixPath('/home/gil/github.com')
         gil@bad_cat ~ $ pf&quot;{$HOME}&quot;
         PosixPath('/home/gil')
         gil@bad_cat ~ $ pf&quot;/home/${'US' + 'ER'}&quot;
         PosixPath('/home/gil')
 - Fixed:
  - Set ``ls`` to ``predict_true`` in ``default_threadable_predictors``.  This prevents ``ls`` on OSX
    from being flagged on OSX as unthreadable (incorrectly) because it relies on ``ncurses``.
- update to version 0.8.6
 - Added:
  - Doco about how to update xonsh and how to set and unset environment variables
 - Fixed:
  - Updated behavior of the ``cat`` coreutils function so that it properly
    handles as vareity of cases such as:
      * Exits after concatenating normal files which have a finite size
      * Continues to run for special files which do not have a size,
        such as ``/dev/random``
      * Is interruptable in all cases with Crtl-C.
  - Callable aliases were not properly raising a ``CalledProcessError`` when they
    returned a non-zero exist status when ``$RAISE_SUBPROC_ERROR = True``. This has
    been fixed.
  - Fixed interpretation of color names with PTK2 and Pygments 2.3.1.
- update to version 0.8.5
 - Added:
  - Add alias to `base16 shell &lt;https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell&gt;`_
  - Installation / Usage
      1. To install use pip
      .. code-block:: bash
          python3 -m pip install xontrib-base16-shell
      2. Add on ``~/.xonshrc``
      .. code:: python
          :number-lines:
          $BASE16_SHELL = $HOME + &quot;/.config/base16-shell/&quot;
          xontrib load base16_shell
      3. See image
      .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErickTucto/xontrib-base16-shell/master/docs/terminal.png
          :width: 600px
          :alt: terminal.png
  - New ``DumbShell`` class that kicks in whenever ``$TERM == &quot;dumb&quot;``.
    This usually happens in emacs. Currently, this class inherits from
    the ``ReadlineShell`` but adds some light customization to make
    sure that xonsh looks good in the resultant terminal emulator.
  - Aliases from foreign shells (e.g. Bash) that are more than single expressions,
    or contain sub-shell executions, are now evaluated and run in the foreign shell.
    Previously, xonsh would attempt to translate the alias from sh-lang into
    xonsh. These restrictions have been removed.  For example, the following now
    works:
    .. code-block:: sh
        $ source-bash 'alias eee=&quot;echo aaa \$(echo b)&quot;'
        $ eee
        aaa b
  - New ``ForeignShellBaseAlias``, ``ForeignShellFunctionAlias``, and
    ``ForeignShellExecAlias`` classes have been added which manage foreign shell
    alias execution.
 - Changed:
  - String aliases will now first be checked to see if they contain sub-expressions
    that require evaluations, such as ``@(expr)``, ``$[cmd]``, etc. If they do,
    then an ``ExecAlias`` will be constructed, rather than a simple list-of-strs
    substitutiuon alias being used. For example:
    .. code-block:: sh
        $ aliases['uuu'] = &quot;echo ccc $(echo ddd)&quot;
        $ aliases['uuu']
        ExecAlias('echo ccc $(echo ddd)\n', filename='&lt;exec-alias:uuu&gt;')
        $ uuu
        ccc ddd
  - The ``parse_aliases()`` function now requires the shell name.
  - ``ForeignShellFunctionAlias`` now inherits from ``ForeignShellBaseAlias``
    rather than ``object``.
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed issues where the prompt-toolkit v2 shell would print an extra newline
    after Python evaluations in interactive mode.
- update to version 0.8.4
 - Added:
  - Added the possibility of arbitrary paths to the help strings in ``vox activate`` and
    ``vox remove``; also updated the documentation accordingly.
  - New ``xonsh.aliases.ExecAlias`` class enables multi-statement aliases.
  - New ``xonsh.ast.isexpression()`` function will return a boolean of whether
    code is a simple xonsh expression or not.
  - Added top-level ``run-tests.xsh`` script for safely running the test suite.
 - Changed:
  - String aliases are no longer split with ``shlex.split()``, but instead use
    ``xonsh.lexer.Lexer.split()``.
  - Update xonsh/prompt/cwd.py _collapsed_pwd to print 2 chars if a directory begins with &quot;.&quot;
  - test which determines whether a directory is a virtualenv
    previously it used to check the existence of 'pyvenv.cfg'
    now it checks if 'bin/python' is executable
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed issue with ``and`` &amp; ``or`` being incorrectly tokenized in implicit
    subprocesses. Auto-wrapping of certain subprocesses will now correctly work.
    For example::
        $ echo x-and-y
        x-and-y
  - Fix EOFError when press `control+d`
  - fix no candidates if no permission files in PATH
  - Fixed interpretation of color names with PTK2 and Pygments 2.3.
  - Several ResourceWarnings: unclosed file in tests
  - AttributeError crash when using --timings flag
  - issue #2929
- update to version 0.8.3
 - Added:
  - Dociumentation paragrapgh about gow to run xonsh in Emacs shell
 - Changed:
  - Updated what pip requirements are needed to build the documnetaion
  - ``$XONSH_TRACEBACK_LOGFILE`` now beside strings also accepts ``os.PathLike``
    objects.
  - Updated vended version of ``ply`` to 3.11
  - Deprecation warnings now print from stacklevel 3.
 - Fixed:
  - Annotation assignment statements (e.g. ``x : int = 42``) are now supported.
  - Fixed error output wording for fg and bg commands
  - Flake8 errors
  - xonsh can now properly parse import statements with trailing comma within
    parentheses, e.g.::
      from x import (y, z,)
  - ResourceWarning: unclosed scandir iterator in imphooks.py
  - Removed use of deprecated ``inspect.formatargspec()`` for ``inspect.signature()``
  - ``Makefile`` directive that updates vended version of ``ply``

    <comment>- update to version 0.8.10
 - Added:
  - New ``xonsh.aliases.partial_eval_alias()`` function and related classes
    for dispatching and evaluating partial alias applications for callable
    aliases.
 - Changed:
  - Subprocesses will no longer close file descriptors automatically.
    This was causing issues with other commands that expected file
    descriptors to remain open, such as ``make``.
  - The ``xonsh.Aliases.eval_alaises()`` method updated to use
    ``xonsh.aliases.partial_eval_alias()``.
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed ``xonsh.completers.base.complete_base()`` to no longer throw an
    error caused by ``complete_python()`` sometimes returning a tuple.
    This fixes cases such as ``ls &amp;&amp;&lt;TAB&gt;``.
  - Fixed regression with line continuations in implicit subprocess mode within
    indented blocks of code, such as if-statements.
  - Resolved issue where setting empty signal masks was causing the
    terminal to close. This was problematic for certain command
    pipelines. For example, ``pv /dev/urandom | head`` now works.
  - Prevents recurssive errors from being raised when there is no child process
    in ``xonsh.jobs.wait_for_active_job()``.
  - Tweaked ``xonsh.completers.commands.complete_skipper()`` to insert a space following
    certain tokens (``&amp;&amp;``, ``||``, ``|``, ``and``, ``or``) to avoid overwriting existing tokens
    with completer output.
  - Fixed bug with evaluating recurssive aliases that did not implement
    the full callable alias signature.
 - Security:
  - &lt;news item&gt;,
 - Authors:
  - Anthony Scopatz
  - Gil Forsyth
  - Troy de Freitas
- update to version 0.8.9
 - Added:
  - New ``env_prefix`` &amp; ``env_postfix`` prompt fields for rendering the pre- and
    post-fix characters of the an active virtual environment.
  - ON_WSL attribute in platform.py
  - Rendering of ``{env_name}`` in ``$PROMPT`` is now suppressed if
    the ``$VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`` environment variable is
    defined and truthy.
  - Rendering of ``{env_name}`` in ``$PROMPT`` is now overridden by
    the value of ``str($VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT)`` if that environment variable
    is defined and ``not None``. ``$VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`` takes precedence
    over ``$VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT``.
  - A xontrib which adds support for `direnv &lt;https://direnv.net/&gt;`_
 - Changed:
  - ``env_name`` prompt field now looks up the pre- and post-fix characters,
    rather than relying on hard-coded values.
  - Some minor ``history show`` efficiency improvements.
  - If we are on wsl, avoid to use xonsh_preexec_fn when pipe.
 - Fixed:
  - Made ``$PATH`` searching more robust to broken symlinks on Windows.
  - undesirable SIGSTOP by putting in a SIGCONT
  - Fixed issue with recursive aliases not being passes all keyword arguments
    that are part of the callable alias spec. This allows commands like
    ``aliases['hsa'] = &quot;history show all&quot;; hsa | head`` to no longer fail
    with strange errors.

    <comment>- update to version 0.8.11
 - Added:
  - New ``xonsh.color_tools.short_to_ints()`` function for directly
    converting a short (0 - 256) color into a 3-tuple of ints
    represeting its RGB value.
  - New ``xonsh.ansi_colors.ansi_reverse_style()`` function for
    converting a mapping of color names to ANSI escape codes into
    a mapping from escape codes into color names. This is not a
    round-trippable operation.
  - New ``xonsh.ansi_colors.ansi_color_escape_code_to_name()`` function
    for converting an ANSI color escape code into the closest xonsh
    color name for a given style.
  - New ``xonsh.events.EventManager.exists()`` method enables the checking
    of whether events actually exist with out making the event if it
    doesn't exist.
  - New command-specific event categories called ``on_pre_spec_run_&lt;cmd-name&gt;``
    and ``on_post_spec_run_&lt;cmd-name&gt;`` will be fired before and after
    ``SubpocSpec.run()`` is called.  This allows for command specific
    events to be executed.  For example, ``on_pre_spec_run_ls`` would
    be run prior to an invocation of ``ls``.
  - New ``xonsh.environ.LsColors`` class for managing the ``$LS_COLORS``
    environment variable. This ensures that the ``ls`` command respects the
    ``$XONSH_COLOR_STYLE`` setting. An instance of this class is added to the
    environment when either the ``$LS_COLORS`` class is first accessed or
    the ``ls`` command is executed.
  - The ``on_pre_spec_run_ls`` event is initialized with a default handler
    that ensures that ``$LS_COLORS`` is set in the actual environment prior
    to running an ``ls`` command.
  - New ``xonsh.tools.detype()`` function that simply calls an objects own
    ``detype()`` method in order to detype it.</comment>

    <version>0.9.5</version>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- remove docroot from a documentation file, workaround for rpmlint error file-contains-buildroot
- update to version 0.9.5:
 - Fixed:
  - Style 'bw'. Background colors was added in the style description.
  - Fix causing error in ``get_predictor_threadable`` on windows when try to run not exist command
  - ``pip`` completer no longer fires when ``pip`` happens to appear within a word
    like ``bagpipes``
  - Fixed issue with ``history gc`` command not running properly.
- update to version 0.9.4:
 - Added:
  - Add processing ``%d`` for avoid overwriting in ``run-tests.xsh``
 - Changed:
  - Xonsh now does not attempt to expand raw strings, so now::
      $ echo &quot;$HOME&quot;
      /home/user
      $ echo r&quot;$HOME&quot;
      $HOME
  - sudoedit now runs unthreaded
 - Fixed:
  - threadable predictor for 'env' command based on predictor from the executed
    command. Fixes #2759 and #3103.
  - An error in the 'xon.sh' executable that only popped up during testing has
    been fixed.  Specifically: It now directly calls 'python3' without invoking
    'env'.
  - bashisms extension can be used again with prompt_toolkit v1
  - Fix a crash when setting ``$INTENSIFY_COLORS_ON_WIN`` in certain situations.
  - Fix issue with bashsisms xontrib causing syntax errors for some Python statements
  - portable trick to pass args which replace '/usr/bin/env' is removed and
    '/usr/bin/env' is used. Fixes bug when a python3 used is outside the default
    'PATH'.
- update to version 0.9.3:
 - Deprecated:
  - Python v3.4 has been fully, completely, and (hopefully) correctly
    deprecated. Please migrate to an officially supported version of Python.
- update to version 0.9.2:
 - Changed:
  - For aliases, predictor is build with the predictor of original command, in
    place of default predictor.
 - Fixed:
  - Updated setup.py to require Python 3.4 using the ``python_requires`` keyword.
    This rectifies issues with pip installing xonsh. Python 3.4 support will
    be removed on the following release.
- update to version 0.9.1:
 - Changed:
  - We no longer manually check the Python version in ``setup.py``,
    but instead use the setuptools ``python_requires`` feature.
 - Fixed:
  - Updates for integrating with new colors styles in Pygments v2.4.0.
- update to version 0.9.0:
 - Added:
  - Implemented the following &quot;bang command&quot; bashisms: ``!$``, ``$*``, ``!^``,
    and ``!&lt;str&gt;``.  These are in addition to ``!!``, which was already
    implemented.
  - asciinema (terminal recorder) added in not threadable commands.
  - tput added in not threadable commands.
  - New ``color_tools.KNOWN_XONSH_COLORS`` frozenset.
  - New ``pyghooks.PYGMENTS_MODIFIERS`` mapping from color modifier names to
    pygments colors.
  - New ``pyghooks.color_name_to_pygments_code()`` function for converting
    color names into pygments color codes.
 - Changed:
  - Circle now runs ``black`` checks on contents of bundled xontribs
  - The ``black`` checks no longer skip some files buried deeper in the directory
    tree.
  - Errors while formatting the prompt are highlighted for easier debugging.
  - Pygments styles only define the standard set of colors, by default.
    Additional colors are computed as needed.
  - PTYs created for running threadable command have now size set to same size
    than main terminal.
  - Update documentation pointing to the minimal required version of
    Python (3.5).
 - Deprecated:
  - Drop support for Python 3.4.
 - Removed:
  - ``pyghooks.KNOWN_COLORS`` is no longer needed or useful as pygments colors
    are computed automatically.
  - ``style_tools.KNOWN_COLORS`` was never used, redundant with
    ``pyghooks.KNOWN_COLORS`` and has thus been removed.
 - Fixed:
  - Fixed a DeprecationWarning that would show up during an import of MutableSet.
  - Fixed error with aliases composed of functions wrapped in functools.partial.
  - ``black`` formatted all xontribs
  - deleting a non existing environement variable with default value do nothing
    instead of raising a exception trying to deleting it in existing values dict.
  - Fixed crash while converting ANSI color codes with leading zeroes
  - Fixed crash while parsing invalid ANSI color code
  - fix causing infinite loop when doing ``cat`` empty file
  - Fixed issue which occurs when user doesn't have access to parent directory and
    xonsh scan all parents directory to find if we are in a Hg repository.
  - Fixed issue with pygments-cache not properly generating a cache the first
    time when using prompt-toolkit when using ``ptk2``.
    This was due to a lingering lazy import of ``pkg_resources``
    that has been removed.
  - Minor update for Python v3.8.
  - Fixed a &quot;'NoneType' object is not iterable&quot; bug when looking up ``stty``
    in command cache.
  - The release tarball now includes all test files.
  - Arguments passed to python in 'scripts/xonsh' and in 'scripts/xonsh-cat' are
    now passed by a portable hack in sh, not anymore by /usr/bin/env.
