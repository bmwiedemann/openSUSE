%description
Xcb provides access to the cut buffers built into every X server. It
allows the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line or
with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers can be used as
holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments, so any
number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later. The
program is designed primarily for use with textual data.
