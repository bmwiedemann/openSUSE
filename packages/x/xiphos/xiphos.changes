-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 28 01:26:49 UTC 2014 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 4.0.0:
  + Bug#508 + feat.req#133: Added alternate versification support (av11n):
    Xiphos understands book/chapter/verse (BCV) schemes other than KJV.
    See especially module KJVA's deuterocanon between Malachi and Matthew.
    Related:
    - The navbar is blanked and the pane states "This module has no
      content at this point" if a tab is selected with no content at the
      current verse indication, e.g. when reading in one tab with an
      Apocrypha Bible and then selecting a different non-Apocrypha tab,
      particularly when using Linked Tabs (see View menu).
  + Added module-specific CSS support.  This uses configuration directive
    "PreferredCSSXHTML=style.css", naming a file in the DataPath
    directory.  If present, the file's content is included when rendering
    the pane.
  + Added default CSS support.  Use ~/.xiphos/default-style.css but be
    aware that this has effects on all displayed modules.
  + Added direct load of history from verse list contents (right-click),
    plus direct load of verse list from history contents (history menu).
  + Added Feature=NoParagraphs support, default for verse-per-line.
  + Added OSISXlit and OSISEnum global filter configuration support.
  + Added preservation of CipherKey value for re-use when updating a module.
  + Added xiphos.appdata.xml (/usr/share/appdata) for...well, advertising.
  + Added --chatty configure flag to distinguish tracing from debug build.
  + Changed options to default on for Hebrew vowel points, Hebrew
    cantillation, and Greek accents.
  + Updated navbar behavior: All books potentially available within the
    module's versification are included.  Formerly, books lacking content
    at 1:1 were excluded.
  + Updated manual text for a couple feature requests.
  + Fixed personal commentary dump, which stopped working in recent Sword.
  + Fixed 1st-time mod.mgr to include Crosswire repo name.
  + Fixed main window internal geometry save on quit.
  + Fixed mod.mgr "button bobble" preventing expand/collapse of mod.tree.
  + Fixed bug#513, stop crash on repeated tab deletion.
  + Fixed crash caused by having a (lexdict|genbook) without (dict|book) key.
  + Fixed incompatibility with GTK3.14's unstable interface, preventing
    Preferences window from opening.  Fixed many related incompatibilities.
  + Fixed several inconsistencies between main & parallel views.
  + Fixed inadvertent realignment-induced re-navigation.
  + Cleaned up internal settings structures.
  + Updated BibleSync interface in accordance with 1.1's updated params.
- added /usr/share/appdata/xiphos.appdata.xml

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  4 18:51:52 UTC 2014 - kkirill@opensuse.org

- update to 3.2.2: this is a cosmetic/clean-up release. No new
  capability is present.  
  + Building against GTK3 (i.e. waf configure --gtk=3) should once again
    be reasonable.  Generally, GTK3 will require --enable-webkit-editor,
    because the older editor seems not fully de-lintable for GTK3.
  + Internal use of generic warnings has been updated to re-introduce
    "modal" warnings, i.e. user acknowledgement before Xiphos proceeds.
    This is necessary for e.g. startup catastrophes, where the warning
    dialog must appear and remain for user ACK before the program exits.
  + Added statusbar acknowledgement of alt-[SRM] display modifiers, as well
    as BibleSync keyboard navigation.
  + The Preferences page for BibleSync has been de-cluttered somewhat.
  + A build complaint from very new compilers has been fixed.
- release notes for 3.2.1: this release has drastic forward movement
  in BibleSync plus a number of bug fixes
  + BibleSync is no longer integral to Xiphos alone; it has been separated
    into its own library, to make it available for other Bible programs.
    There is some activity toward integrating it into others already.
  + BibleSync has gained a number of features, both in the library itself
    and in how Xiphos uses it.  It now uses its own Preferences page, due to
    additional features and complexity.  Notably, BibleSync operates using
    speaker beacons, limiting the trouble that can be caused by either
    inadvertent or malicious navigation by others.
  + BibleSync in Xiphos 3.2.1 will not interoperate with 3.2.0.  The
    addition of speaker beacons means that 3.2.0 will not recognize or
    generate them, and 3.2.1 will not recognize a speaker without them.
    (As applied to BibleSync 1.0.0 -vs- 1.0.1 differences.)
  + Fixed a very old error regarding inconsistent internal use of the
    scripture cross-reference option.
  + Consequent to that xref bug fix, exported content correctly no longer
    contains either footnotes or xrefs.
  + Persistent difficulties with module archive have been resolved.
  + Generic warning dialogs, used all over the place, have been replaced
    with a non-modal method that is not troublesome in the face of timing
    constraints.
  + Added populating the verse list directly from a dialog (context menu).
- release notes for 3.2.0: this release is to accommodate one
  late-arriving Sword engine change and to support generalized companion
  modules.  It also provides the first implementation of BibleSync,
  a shared navigation protocol specification for Bible programs, details
  of which we are sharing with other programs' authors and hope to see
  being made available soon. Also, several urgent bugfixes have been made.
  + New BibleSync subsystem: Multicast group navigation with glue on
    navigation reception and transmission when navigating locally.
  + Preferences added to support BibleSync options: mode enable, navigation
    style choice, and activity tracing and privacy toggle options.
  + Updated companion modules (conf directive Companion=Abc,Def,Xyz) for
    Bibles and commentaries so as to allow arbitrary sets where the 1st
    opens in the main window and the rest open in detached windows.  This is
    important for organizations such as Wycliffe who produce grouped
    modules, useful in such a manner.
  + Added kbd toggles alt-S (Strong's), alt-M (morphology), alt-R (red words).
  + Heading generation changed in line with Sword 1.7.3's new internals.
  + Fixed crash on unparseable xref module content.
  + Fixed crash on copy/export.
  + Fixed crash on bogus middle-click on multi-ref bookmark.
  + Fixed module manager column width setting.
  + Fixed module manager archive function.
  + Fixed NASB-specific lexica references for forthcoming NASB release.
  + Removed gconf query.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  2 16:13:41 UTC 2014 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.1.6:
  + The existence and placement of Preferences, Module Manager, and
    Advanced Search windows is saved.
  + Major compatibility changes for the underlying Sword interface,
    especially renderText() and its minions.
  + Live chat nick selection identifies user's platform and Xiphos
    version.
  + Manual updates to reflect recent additions (eg. Alt-A
    [annotate]).
  + Journals can be opened in regular display detached window (not
    editor).
  + "Friendly" (abbreviation) month names for devotional use in the
    dictionary pane.
  + Export off-by-one error when crossing chapter boundary is fixed.
    Export also made somewhat more general and featureful.
    3.1.5's missing export submenu is back.
  + Addition of repository support for HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP.
  + Version differences in dbus IPC (xiphos-nav) have been
    homogenized.   
  + Build inconsistencies across Linux distributions are fixed.
  + Removed last vestiges of unneeded, defunct KJV pilcrow (¬∂)
    handling.
  + A number of updates to native language support for module tree
    lists.
  + Sword's OSISVariants now works (had never been added since
    Sword's OSIS support came into existence).
  + Xiphos internals have moved forward to Sword's XHTML interface,
    leaving behind the old HTMLHREF interface.  Many consequent
    internal changes.
  + Unicode punctuation is no longer mis-spoken in ReadAloud.
  + The last of the historic gtkhtml3 support has been removed,
    other than the editor component in GTK2: Xiphos depends
    exclusively on webkit. This is Xiphos' 5th display engine.
    We do not intend to change it ever again.
- Stop passing --backend=webkit to configure, no longer needed, nor
  reqcognized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 16 01:22:55 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Own %{_datadir}/omf: scrollkeeper used to own this, but with the
  switch to rarian we have to care of it ourselves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  8 18:48:05 UTC 2013 - kkirill@opensuse.org

- updated to 3.1.5:
  + The WebKit display driver.
  + GTK3 compatibility.
  + Module-internal footnote & xref numbering/lettering is respected.
  + Display of headings, footnotes, xrefs, and red words all default On.
  + Image content is resized in parallel windows and the previewer.
  + Module lists include modules' 1-line descriptions as well as short names.
  + Verse numbers will no longer be "widowed" (left alone at the end of a
    line) by being forced to combine against the first word of their verse.
  + Verse number display is configurable: bold, brackets, superscripts.
  + RtoL consistency improvements.
  + Studypad save respects its default directory specification.
  + Base font is respected in all parallel views.
  + Font selection order has been fixed: Any user specification (per module
    or per language) supercedes module configuration file specification.
  + In export, avoid more than one dialog, ever, about checking a module's
    license, and change copy/export defaults to plaintext and 1 verse.
  + Ctrl-0 (zero) forces base font size to 0.
  + Ctrl-[1-9] selects the Nth tab.
  + Countless internal module, cache, font, and display fixes.
- added dependency on sword package (it contains sword global configurations)

Fri Mar 20 00:53:16 MSK 2009 - kirill.kirillov@gmail.com

- update to 3.0.1
  + Added transliteration support from non-Latin character sets.
  + Fixed a crash-inducing bug in detached ("free-floating") Bible
    and commentary windows, from context menu synchronization. This
    was redundant with the sync button in upper left, so the menu
    item was removed, and a glitch in the sync button's use was fixed.
  + Sidebar module list entries can be expanded by clicking anywhere
    on the row.
  + Only when not using tabbed browsing, a crash on history usage was
    stopped, though a full fix for tab-less history access is pending.
  + A PDF version of the manual is included.
  + Fixed a disappearing-button problem in the module manager, as well
    as several instances of faulty mutex usage.
- changes for 3.0.0 (Xiphos begins life, as the former GnomeSword)
  + Invocation of the editor (personal commentary, prayer list/journal) 
    will induce several harmless warning messages to occur.
  + A fabulous new look, with the support of professional graphics
    designers having done a facelift of our graphics
  + Standard module repository setup for first-time users
  + Image resize enabled by default
  + Commentary-by-chapter display, as a commentary module option,
    rather than just per-verse commentary.
  + Consistent dialog usages: Y/N questions and file browsers.
  + Module manager: Remembers previous settings. New remote source is
    set as current. Tooltips over icons in module manager lists.
    Visual improvements by showing repository in use and separating
    full module lists from limited update/uninstalled lists. Now
    functions correctly with both shared and personal storage areas.
  + Compatibility with forthcoming Sword engine updates for dynamic
    versification ("dv11n"). Future modules will support e.g.
    deuterocanonical books in Catholic Bibles. 
  + More uniform module option support in parallel window.
  + Dictionary links auto-display in the previewer, after the
    fashion of Strong's and morphology references.
  + Better Help menu selections: Online chat support, bug reporting,
    mailing list pointers.
  + Better search term highlighting in both sidebar and dialog search.
  + Double-click navigation of search results entries.
  + Improved/fixed search abort.  Assume "AND" semantic for sidebar
    multiple word search.
  + Countless internal cleanups, efficiency improvements, and
    bugfixes, the need for many of which was exposed by the Windows
    port effort.
  + Additions to the manual, especially for instruction on original
    language research and how to get help
  + Better integration of image support with ImageMagick libraries.
  + Respect for configuration-specified font choices (Font= and
    Fontsize= in module configuration files).
  + Improvements to build-time configuration support.
  + Fixed fast search ("lucene") index creation.

Thu Nov  6 14:55:51 CET 2008 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 2.4.1:
  + GnomeSword now takes control of sword:// URLs without asking any
    question, iff there was previously no handler for them.  (In a
    debug build, the question is still asked, but with better phrasing.)
  + Intermediate module paths for prayer lists are properly constructed.
  + GnomeSword can be built under Solaris (--enable-gtkhtml only).
  + Ctrl-F "find" capability: Without a Bible pane, it operates in
    comm/book pane; without that, it operates in dictionary pane.
  + Advanced Search provides search term highlight in result preview.
    Also, the Find button toggles to Stop during a search.
  + New icons, courtesy of Simon Meers.
  + Module configuration default font specifications.  If a configuration
    contains "Font=Some Font Name" or "Fontsize=+2", GnomeSword will
    respect that as a default.  The user can change it of course, but any
    time the user resorts to default font name or +0 size, module
    configuration takes over.
  + Companion modules: If a Bible or commentary has configuration file
    element Companion=OtherModule, then GnomeSword will offer to open
    that module as well when opening the first module.
  + F1-F4 provide help, preferences, advanced search, and module manager.
  + fixed: 2163853  Scrolling Issues

  + closed feature request: 2056615

  + Selecting choices for Strong's modules is now complete, and Preferences
    comboboxes have gained an instructive "--Select--" first entry.

  + Sort capability in mod.mgr has been disabled (contextually pointless).
  + Module deletions are reflected immediately in list on completion.

- update to 2.3.6:
  + fixed bugs: 1973928, 1994431, 2033166
  + closed feature requests: 1991842, 2009885
  + In the module manager, along with the usual per-module-type
    categorization of modules, the mod.mgr also produces a parallel
    per-availability categorization, for updated and uninstalled
    modules.  This makes it easier to find new stuff, rather than 
    having to crawl through all the per-type listings.
  + General books' bookmarks are generated using the key text rather
    than an arcane internal numeric module offset.
  + Devotionals open to today's MM.DD key, rather than attempting
    (and always failing) to open on the current dictionary key.
  + Genbook navbar tooltips have been made a bit more understandable
  + Main verse navigation has keyboard shorcuts on variations of N/P
  + The personal commentary editor can be invoked with Alt-Z.
  + Locked modules' cipher keys are stored correctly.
  + Image, Map, and Daily Devotional modules no longer appear in more
    than one module list.
  + Prayer lists have expanded to include a general journal concept; a
    few crash bugs have been fixed, and templates for journals & topical
    outlines are available.  These user-editable modules seem now to be
    suitable for general user-driven module creation in genbook format.
