  <title>Stereogram generator</title>
  <description>Stereograph is a stereogram generator. In detail it is a single image
stereogram (SIS) generator. That's a program that produces
two-dimensional images that seem to be three-dimensional (surely you
know the famous works of &quot;The Magic Eye&quot;, Stereograph produces the same
output). You do _not_ need any pair of colored spectacles to regard
them - everyone can learn it.</description>
