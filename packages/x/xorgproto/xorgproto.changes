Thu Apr 21 02:20:44 UTC 2022 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- xorgproto 2022.1
  * No changes to the actual protocols, just the additions of some
    new keysyms provided by the Linux kernel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 15 20:54:39 UTC 2021 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- xorgproto 2021.5
  * This release introduces the version 2.4 of the X Input
    protocol. It contains the addition of the concept of touchpad
    gestures. Touchpad gesture is an interaction of two or more
    fingers that can be interpreted as a swipe or a pinch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 31 15:07:17 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- package licenses as %%license 
- modernize spec file
- list files in files-section to avoid directory permission
  conflict with filesystem package

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- xorgproto 2021.4
The big new feature in this release is Olivier's addition that makes up
XFixes 6: the new ClientDisconnectMode. An X server that is started on
demand (Xwayland) should ideally also terminate when the last client
disconnects. However, some X11 clients that provide system services will
linger around forever, preventing that shutdown.

With the new XFixes request, a client can designate itself as
to-be-terminated and the X server can ignore those clients when counting the
number of remaining clients. If no other clients are left, the server can
shut down.

Note that this requires changes to the X server and each client to work.

- xorgproto 2021.3
If you thought the 2021.2 release was exciting, well, you're in for a
surprise: this one even builds with meson! How cool is that?!

Somewhat related: the new script to generate and verify the keysyms was
missing from the (autotools-generated) tarball, causing a meson build from
that tarball to fail during the setup phase. This is fixed now.

No changes to the rest of the sources, so this is effectively identical to
yesterday's tarball.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- xorgproto 2021.2
This release is mostly all about keysyms. Some additions to Vietnamese and
Hangul but the big set of commits here is catching up with several years of
Linux kernel releases.

The kernel's evdev interface has semantic keycodes (e.g. KEY_ESC is what
you'd expect). Beyond the normal range expected to change with different
layouts there are many keycodes that should only ever do one thing.
For example, KEY_ONSCREEN_KEYBOARD should display the OSK regardless of
layout). In the past, we've added these keysyms on a as-requested basis.

We now have a reserved subrange in the already reserved range for XF86Foo
keysyms. Within that range, keysyms map directly to their evdev
counterparts, making future updates easier. The above example
KEY_ONSCREEN_KEYBOARD now has a XF86OnScreenKeyboard keysym.
The header file follows a strict convention to make this range
machine-readable, xkeyboard-config can make use of this to
make those keysyms available by default. Note that almost all keys are
outside the X keycode range so very little will change under X.

Note that most keys exist on selected devices only so the practial use is
quite limited. But those keysyms are available through normal XKB
configuration so users can re-map existing keys where needed.

Aside from those, a bit of misc cleanup work. Many thanks to all
contributors.

Tue Apr 14 21:22:36 UTC 2020 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- xorgproto 2020.1
  * This release adds a new keysym, a state-change event to the
    DPMS extension, synchronizes more of the meson and autotools
    build sytems, and converts some quasi-text documentation to
    Markdown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 18 10:05:56 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- xorgproto 2019.2
  * This release moves more header files to the legacy set. Note
    that this means libX11 older than 1.6.9 and libXvMC older
    than 1.0.12 will not build without some legacy headers installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 24 14:28:53 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- use --enable-legacy configure option on existing products in order
  not to break package builds, which still requires any of these 
  extensions:
  * trapproto
  * xf86miscproto
  * xproxymngproto
  deleterequests for the affected packaages have been done for factory/TW

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 21 10:08:56 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- xorgproto 2019.1
  * This release boasts a bunch of cleanup work and a few new 
    keysyms. No functional changes to any of the protocols.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 27 23:07:34 UTC 2018 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Obsolete protocol packages by their corresponding old package names, not by
  their pkconfig(...) provides. Additionally move the obsoletes to the -devel
  package to take effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 20:45:12 UTC 2018 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Create package xorgproto with initial version 2018.4:
  This package contains all previously split up xorg protocol headers in one
  package (again!). Additionally this package contains two new protocol 
  versions required by the upcoming XServer 1.20:
  + dri3proto version 1.2
  + randrproto version 1.6
- Obsolete the old *prot packages by using the actual protocol version to keep
  this package compatible with the old versioning scheme.
- "Prefer: xorgproto-devel" in the project config is required to prefer it for
  now
