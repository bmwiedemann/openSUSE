- xorgproto 2019.1
  * This release boasts a bunch of cleanup work and a few new 
    keysyms. No functional changes to any of the protocols.

- Obsolete protocol packages by their corresponding old package names, not by
  their pkconfig(...) provides. Additionally move the obsoletes to the -devel
  package to take effect.

Wed Feb 28 20:45:12 UTC 2018 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Create package xorgproto with initial version 2018.4:
  This package contains all previously split up xorg protocol headers in one
  package (again!). Additionally this package contains two new protocol 
  versions required by the upcoming XServer 1.20:
  + dri3proto version 1.2
  + randrproto version 1.6
- Obsolete the old *prot packages by using the actual protocol version to keep
  this package compatible with the old versioning scheme.
- "Prefer: xorgproto-devel" in the project config is required to prefer it for
  now
