    <comment>- Obsolete protocol packages by their corresponding old package names, not by
  their pkconfig(...) provides. Additionally move the obsoletes to the -devel
  package to take effect.

- Create package xorgproto with initial version 2018.4:
  This package contains all previously split up xorg protocol headers in one
  package (again!). Additionally this package contains two new protocol 
  versions required by the upcoming XServer 1.20:
  + dri3proto version 1.2
  + randrproto version 1.6
- Obsolete the old *prot packages by using the actual protocol version to keep
  this package compatible with the old versioning scheme.
- &quot;Prefer: xorgproto-devel&quot; in the project config is required to prefer it for
  now

If things with 

  &quot;Prefer: xorgproto-devel&quot; 

in the project config works out in factory, I'll make delete requests
for *proto packages.</comment>

    <comment>- use --enable-legacy configure option on existing products in order
  not to break package builds, which still requires any of these 
  extensions:
  * trapproto
  * xf86miscproto
  * xproxymngproto
  deleterequests for the affected packaages have been done for factory/TW

- xorgproto 2019.1
  * This release boasts a bunch of cleanup work and a few new 
    keysyms. No functional changes to any of the protocols.</comment>
