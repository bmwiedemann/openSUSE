- Update to version 1.4:
  + RANDR decoding updated from just 0.x protocol to handle
    1.0 - 1.4
  + Atoms recorded from InternAtom & GetAtomName to use for display
    in other requests referencing the atoms
  + Property requests now also show these property types in a more
    natural format instead of as just lists of bytes:
  + New -I command line flag to enter interactive mode immediately
    at startup
  + Experimental support for reading a previously recorded file.
    If you run "xscope -r -v0 > xscope.raw", then you can later run
    "xscope -f xscope.raw" to decode the data.
