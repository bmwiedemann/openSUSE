- Updat to version 1.4.5
  Support for using inet_ntop() was originally added to support IPv6, and
  only used for IPv6 addresses.  Two decades later, this interface is
  ubiquitous and OS'es have starting marking the old interfaces as deprecated,
  so this release changes to use the modern interface whenever we can now.
  (Note that code included from xtrans will only use the modern interfaces
  when IPv6 is disabled if building against xtrans 1.6.0 or later.)

- Update to version 1.4:
  + RANDR decoding updated from just 0.x protocol to handle
    1.0 - 1.4
  + Atoms recorded from InternAtom & GetAtomName to use for display
    in other requests referencing the atoms
  + Property requests now also show these property types in a more
    natural format instead of as just lists of bytes:
  + New -I command line flag to enter interactive mode immediately
    at startup
  + Experimental support for reading a previously recorded file.
    If you run "xscope -r -v0 > xscope.raw", then you can later run
    "xscope -f xscope.raw" to decode the data.
