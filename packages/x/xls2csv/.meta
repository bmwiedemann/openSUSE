  <title>A script that recodes a spreadsheet's charset and saves as CSV</title>
  <description>This script will recode a spreadsheet into a different character set and output the recoded data as a csv file.
The script came about after many headaches from dealing with Excel spreadsheets from clients that were being received in various character sets.</description>
