  <title>A morphing program</title>
  <description>This morphing program reads two images in Targa format and computes the
transitions from one image to the other (arbitrarily many steps). To
avoid a simple fading effect, the program needs information about the
shapes contained in the two images. This is done by using a grid
consisting of connected checkpoints. The source grid is then
transformed into the destination grid during the morphing process.</description>
