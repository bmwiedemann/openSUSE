%description
xtensor is a C++ library meant for numerical analysis with multi-dimensional array expressions.

xtensor provides
   - an extensible expression system enabling lazy broadcasting.
   - an API following the idioms of the C++ standard library.
   - tools to manipulate array expressions and build upon xtensor.

Containers of xtensor are inspired by NumPy, the Python array programming library. Adaptors for existing data structures to be plugged into the expression system can easily be written.
