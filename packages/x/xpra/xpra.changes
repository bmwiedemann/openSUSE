- Converting python3-* items to %{python_ver}-*

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  3 15:20:31 UTC 2023 - Scott Bradnick <scott.bradnick@suse.com>

- Leap 15.5 and 15.6 _can_ build again with Python3.11
  * Need to have the following packages available:
    * python3[11]-Cython      v3.0.2
    * python3[11]-flit-core   v3.8.0
    * python3[11]-wheel       v0.40.0
  * The versions from devel:languages:python work, but until those
    are part of the Leap images, this isn't possible
