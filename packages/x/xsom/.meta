  <title>XML Schema Object Model (XSOM)</title>
  <description>XML Schema Object Model (XSOM) is a Java library that allows applications to
easily parse XML Schema documents and inspect information in them. It is
expected to be useful for applications that need to take XML Schema as an
input.  The library is a straight-forward implement of &quot;schema components&quot; as
defined in the XML Schema spec part 1.  Refer to this specification of how this
object model works.
