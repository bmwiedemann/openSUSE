- Update to 0.3:
  Added:
  * Support for transparency: color specification can now contain a
    value for the alpha channel.
  * Automatic default sink index detection in the example pulseaudio
    watcher script. This should make the script work out of the box
    for most users.
  * Ready to use screen brightness watcher script in the README.
  * Quiet mode (-q).
  Changed:
  * xob now depends on libxrender for the new transparency feature
    (this can be optionally disabled when building xob).
  * Improved documentation of the named-pipe method.
  * The documentation encourages users to use dedicated input programs
    instead of the named-pipe method (now presented as a fallback method).
  Fixed:
  * Documentation used to advise to overwrite the content of named pipes
    which could lead to premature file endings. The documentation now
    recommends to append new values command >> named_pipe.
  * Issue in the pulseaudio watcher script where pulseaudio sink indexes
    were abusively used as indexes of the internal pulsectl library's
    data structures.
