- move all xorg.conf.d snippets from /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d to
  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d (boo#1139692)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 30 09:53:33 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- upt to version 2.10.6
  * Since evdev is in maintenance mode there aren't a lot of
    features to go around but still a few important fixes. Andrey
    fixed the proximity event generation for tablets and the
    handling of devices without axes but buttons - previously
    those were assumed to be keyboards in the server. Better
    error reporting from Christian and the rest are build system
    fixes that went into all xorg repositories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 14:46:21 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- includes everything needed for missing sle issue entries:
  fate #320263, fate#315643-315645, 319159-319161, 319618 (bsc#1041371)
- 50-elotouch.conf: Make sure an 'TouchSystems CarrollTouch 4500U'
  is an absolute device (bnc#876089, bsc#1041371)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 19 13:09:53 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- update to version 2.10.5
  * Two fixes, one new feature for the evdev driver. The new
    feature is the ability to change the emulated middle button
    number (e.g. useful on devices with physical middle button
    as well).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  1 19:35:04 UTC 2016 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to version 2.10.4
  * Support XINPUT ABI version 23 and 24

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 12:19:56 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.10.3
  * Only one fix over 2.10.2 restoring tablets' functionality. A
    bug in the wheel emulation rework caused non-x/y axes to stop
    updating. Interaction with tablets thus resulted in a zero
    pressure sent to the clients an the tablet being unable to draw.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 15:15:52 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.10.2
  This release restores wheel emulation on absolute devices and drops the
  forced direction locking for scroll buildup during wheel emulation since it
  made it almost impossible to actually scroll in both directions. Since
  horizontal scrolling is disabled by default anyway, we don't need this lock.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 11:20:21 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.10.1
  Only one change over 2.10, affecting some devices with absolute axes but not
  ABS_X/ABS_Y. Previously, those devices had the first to axes mapped to axes
  0 and 1 and thus some random axes was interpreted as x/y coordinate. With
  this release, axes 0 and 1 are reserved for x/y axes only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 12:17:36 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Use url for source
- Add gpg signature
- Make building more verbose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 28 15:39:33 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.10.0
  Plenty of bugfixes accumulated over time, one new option is now
  available: Resolution. This enables a user to set a mouse device's
  native resolution, if set the device's deltas are scaled to a
  normalized 1000dpi resolution. This can be used to make
  high-resolution mice less sensitive without having to actually
  change the acceleration in the desktop environment. The default
  for this option is 0 and no scaling is performed.

- Ignore absence of udevadm, it won't be present in the build env.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 09:03:48 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.9.2
  * Two fixes in this release, one to support Android MT devices,
    one to avoid an array index overflow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 29 21:56:14 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.9.1:
  This release fixes a couple of bugs with absolute devices that
  have scroll wheels (such as the qemu tablets devices) and avoids
  the "unable to find touch point 0" warnings previously caused by
  a touch starting before the device was enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 00:24:10 UTC 2014 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- enable multitouch support (missing libmtdev build dependency),
  fixes bnc#889469

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 20 22:52:33 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.9.0:
  Use the server's device list for duplicate detection (FDO#78309)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  7 14:29:13 UTC 2014 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.8.99.1 (2.9RC1)
  The first evdev 2.9 Snapshot.
  The biggest changes are the switch to libevdev and support for
  server-managed fds. The latter needs server support, so don't
  expect it to work on anything but git master.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  7 10:18:23 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 2.8.3
  * Only two changes, the REL_DIAL fix restores proper horizontal
    scrolling behaviour to a set of Microsoft mice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- provides/obsoletes x11-input-mtrack, since multitouch devices
  are now covered via mtdev library; drop request for 
  x11-input-mtrack has been filed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 13:21:26 UTC 2013 - sndirsch@suse.com

- added 11-evdev.conf xorg.conf.d snippet, since apparently some
  tweaks are still required (bnc#843333)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  6 23:53:08 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.8.2:
  Second release for evdev 2.8 is now available. Two minor but important
  fixes. Evdev now writes SYN_REPORT after toggling LEDs, so other processes
  listening in on the device can see the change immediately. The other fix
  addresses an inconsistency in the mapping of REL_DIAL.
- Remove upstream patches:
  + Patch1: U_0001-Write-a-SYN_REPORT-after-the-last-LED.patch
  + Patch2: U_0002-Don-t-use-mtdev-for-protocol-B-devices.patch
  + Patch3: U_0003-Remove-a-comment.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 19:25:10 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.8.1:
  A new option was added, "TypeName" defines the
  XI device type provided in the XListInputDevices() reply.
  Two fixes, one for a set of MT devices without legacy axes, one for a
  misconfiguration (inertia of 0 should be no inertia).
  Switch default model to pc104, but the switch to pc104 has no effect,
  it's merely to make it more explicit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 26 13:56:22 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 2.8.0:
  Not a whole lot of new things happening here, mostly
  cleanup and various misc fixes. Most bugfixes have already found their way
  into the 2.7.x releases.
- Notable changes:
  + axis swap/inversion and calibration is now possible for touch events too
    (#59340)
  + maintainer-mode is now always enabled
  + evdev uses sigsafe logging if available
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  + evdev_move-valuator-swapping-into-a-helper-function.patch (patch0)
  + evdev_move-calibration-asjustments-to-helper-function.patch (patch1)
  + evdev_handle-axis-swap-calibration-and-inversion-for-touch-events.patch (patch2)
