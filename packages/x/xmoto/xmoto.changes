   (This does not affect X-Moto on Windows, libcurl is included with 
   the game there).
 * Slight physics adjustment: It should no longer be possible to fall

    inresponsive on some systems.

    smooth, most notable on lower end systems.

    also by Eric Piel. Please notify me if some compatibility is 
    broken by this, and I'll try to fix it as fast as possible.

  * The user is now warned if he's entering a level with 
    geometrical errors.

    rewinding).
  * Applied MacOS X patch by Maxime Biais.
  * Replays can no longer be recorded for levels that 
    include scripting.
  * Older releases will not be able to read the new 
    replays, but this version can read old replays 
    without any problems (in which case the new event
    features will be missing).
  * Faster building procedure on Windows.
  * New built-in levels, one of them by Clive Crous.
  * New tutorial levels. These are now considered external
    levels, so you'll find them under that tab.
  * Smoother playback of replays.
  * Note that I have given up ordering the built-in levels
    by difficulty. The current order will be kept until
    beta.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
