  <title>MPEG-4 Simple and Advanced Simple Profile codec</title>
  <description>The Xvid video codec implements MPEG-4 Simple Profile and Advanced
Simple Profile standards. It permits compressing and decompressing
digital video in order to reduce the required bandwidth of video
data for transmission over computer networks or efficient storage
on CDs or DVDs. Due to its unrivalled quality Xvid has gained great
popularity and is used in many other GPLed applications, like e.g.
Transcode, MEncoder, MPlayer, Xine and many more.
