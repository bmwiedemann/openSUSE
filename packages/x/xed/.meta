  <title>A small and lightweight text editor</title>
  <description>X-Apps Text Editor is a small, but powerful text editor designed for the Cinnamon desktop and others.
It has most standard text editor functions and fully supports international text in Unicode.
Advanced features include syntax highlighting and automatic indentation of source code, printing and editing of multiple
documents in one window.
X-Apps Text Editor is extensible through a plugin system, which currently includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing VCS ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.</description>
