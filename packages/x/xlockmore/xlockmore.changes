  Fix for hyper mode from original author, for potential but not
    likely memory leak and free(NULL) issue John Heidemann, johnh
    AT isi.edu.
  More buffer gcc warnings removed for dclock.c, image.c, and
    scrnsave.c.
  ras.c/magick.c gcc 10 fix from Adrian Reber, adrian AT lisas.de .
    VMS already handles this in make.com.
  Lots of spelling errors fixed due to codespell
    https://manpages.debian.org/testing/codespell/codespell.1.en.html
  A few more gl modes (molecule, invert) fixed up by
    EoflaOE ViceCity to run in xscreensaver.
  Added additional changes to solitaire and invert.  invert will

    for juggler3d.cc in previous release.
  Change from Denys Vlasenko (thanks to Adrian Reber for pointing out)
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=874484

    in xscreensaver.
  Updated references to website to https.  https://www.sillycycle.com

    jgh AT FreeBSD.org for xglock fixes for "failed due to signal" for
    clang.
  Syncing with xscreensaver and many modes modified, more than
    half working there.  pacman and puzzle run but need some
    obvious work, others run too fast or flash on the screen.
    Various fixes from Jouk Jansen and EoflaOE ViceCity.
    Updated GL modes also, inaddition to overlap: biof, skewb, and
    fire (needs images). See xscreensaver/README for new directions.
  Updated in linux to build with modules, must have broken somewhere
    down the line.  imake build fixed too.
  bomb mode fixed for xlock.
  Syncing with xscreensaver.  Much has changed since last time this
    was done and much left to do.  Nonglx "a"'s and some "b"'s done
    so far.  Automata modes like ant.c should use automata.c and
    automata.h supplied by xlockmore.
    ball bat not working right there yet.  Also bouboule to do right will
    require changes to xlockmore files from xscreensaver.
    See new xscreensaver/README for instructions.
  While testing uncovered old security bug in anenome mode and fixed.
  life updates to use a more standard notation for nontotalistic cellular
    automata.
  ax_pthread.m4 needed for autoconf, added back in, oops.
  Removed VMS caddr_t fix from matrix.c, cage.c, gears.c, glplanet.c,
    invert.c, juggler3d.c, lament.c, moebius.c, molecule.c, morph3d.c,
    noof.c, pipes.c, rubik.c, sierpinski3d.c, skewb.c, stairs.c,
    superquadrics.c as no longer needed.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  boxed and maze3d modes added thanks mainly to Jouk Jansen.
  boxed added to xlock95.scr.  xlock95 Makefile now builds to 64 bit.
  Thanks to Jason Helfman, jgh AT FreeBSD.org for sound installation fixes.
  Thanks to Tobias Kortkamp, for his patch for glock compile issue with
    CLANG 6.0.0.
  Fixing warnings using clang for back.xpm, nose.c, passwd.c.
  Fixing errors using g++ for deluxe.c, also various casting added.
  Fixing potential some buffer overruns pointed out in mingw in
    apollonian.c and hyper.c.
  Fixing potential error of using null pointer thanks again to mingw in
    xlock.c.
  pyro2 was not showing anything on screen due to it not finding font,
    changed it to default to mode_font if can not find.
  Thanks to Dave Odell, dmo2118 AT gmail.com for his fzort mode update to
    use the functions in xshm.c and fixes crash when running X11 over network.
  Note from Dave Odell:
    <https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/xscreensaver-5.37.tar.gz>. MI_INIT() is
    defined and documented in hacks/xlockmore.h, with related functions
    defined in hacks/xlockmore.c.  MI_INIT() currently takes three parameters:
    the ModeInfo *, the state array, and a function pointer for the new free
    hook. FWIW, it could instead be just the first two parameters, with the
    free hook being set up like the other ModeHooks; this would be a bit
    nicer, I think. But I was going for something that could be applied
    incrementally to individual screenhacks in XScreenSaver, and could -- in
    theory -- be brought back to xlockmore with minimal impact.
  ant mode resync'd with xscreensaver...  Thanks to David Odell redoing my
    sad attempt.
  -sound configuration changed around so it should work on more machines,
    now uses DEF_PLAY and play.sh by default.
  Thanks to Stanislav Brabec, sbrabec AT suse.cz for his "hack" to fix for
    PAM with non-English locales.  He notes to fix properly a "Password"
    prompt list should be obtained at the initial phase of authentication.
    Added PAM_PASSWORD_PROMPT for using old way.
  Fixed leak in scooter thanks to Valgrind.

- Drop esound-devel BuildRequires: the distro moved away from
