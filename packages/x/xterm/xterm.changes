         fonts (request by Nickolas Raymond Kaczynski).
       + improve caching of TrueType missing-glyph tests.
       + allow no more than 255 fonts to be scanned for a fontset.
       + eliminate a table-lookup in findXftGlyph

         and alternate screens (report by Valtteri Vuorikoski).
       + remove  adjustment  from  update_winsize leftover from initial
         work (report by Valtteri Vuorikoski).
  * modify wcwidth tables to separate Unicode Cf category as formatting
    control-characters,  to  better match the guideline for unsupported
    characters (report by Tim Chase).
  * add configure option --disable-exec-selection.
  * use mkstemp where mkdtemp is unavailable, when initializing colored
    cursor.
  * adapt fixes from OpenBSD xenocara:

    with depth 30 (patch by Denis Kaganovich).
  * improve  color-computation  for  SGR  2  faint/dim  (patch by Boian
    Bonev).  Add  resource  faintIsRelative  to specify if the modified

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 21 12:30:36 UTC 2022 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- update to 372:
  * amend   allocation/freeing  of  scrollback  lines,  eliminating  an
    adjustment  for status-line added in patch #371 (report/testcase by
    Rajeev V. Pillai).
- update to 371:
     * drop   double-buffer   default   from   test-packages,  since  that
       interferes with status-line.
     * add  faceSize7  to  table  in  charproc.c, overlooked in patch #360
       (patch by Vladimir A. Pavlov).
     * use  XDrawString rather than XDrawString16 for text when the latter
       is not needed.
     * improve performance for initializing/reusing graphic objects in the
       SIXEL feature.
     * improve error-checking for resize.
     * fix errata in manual page (Debian #988221).
     * extended  list  of environment variables to purge on startup, i.e.,
       in case a user starts xterm from another terminal emulator.
     * add  comment  in cursor.c to explain why autowrap (DECAWM) does not
       apply  to  data  saved/restored with save/restore cursor-operations
       (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * add  special  case  in  generating the combining-character table in
       wcwidth.c,  for  Hangul  Jamo  Extended-B  (report  by  Luis Javier
       Merino).
     * simplify/improve portability of trap commands in shell-scripts.
     * update configure options
       --disable-rectangles,
       --disable-tcap-fkeys and
       --disable-tcap-query
       to account for changed default settings.
     * rather  than  ignore empty parameter for setting title, use that to
       reset it to “xterm” for scripting.
     * check  for  out-of-bounds  condition while drawing sixels, and quit
       that operation (report by Nick Black).
     * add  fallback definition for PROJECTROOT so that a suitable default
       location for luit will be compiled-in on build-servers.
     * implement DEC status-line controls DECSASD/DECSSDT:
          + decode controls, set state
          + implement DECRQSS responses
          + implement indicator-style status-line
          + add configure option --enable-status-line
          + add resource indicatorFormat
          + implement    host-writable   status-line,   able   to   handle
            video-attributes  and  simple left/right cursor movement. This
            disallows all of the DEC/xterm private modes such as switching
            to/from the alternate screen.
          + move the status-line if the window is resized.
          + Note:  the  associated  screen-resizing  does not work for the
            special case of TrueType fonts with double-buffering (see note
            in patch #349).
     * modify  configure-script fixup for -Werror options to exclude fixup
       for -Werror=format, e.g., -Werror=format-security.
     * amend  change  from  patch  #370; DEC 070's pseudo-code for DECCOLM
       incorrectly suggests that it enables DECLRMM as a side-effect.
     * fix  some  memory leaks seen using esctest and asan2 (patch by Luis
       Javier Merino).

    soft-hyphen from patch #334 changes (patch by Martijn van Duren).
  * improve terminfo:
      + fill-in   function-keys  in  terminfo  which  are  not  Sun/HP
        keyboards using xterm+nopcfkeys building-block.
      + add kbeg to xterm+keypad to accommodate termcap applications

  * add workaround for broken pcre2 package in Debian 10.
  * change  screen-refresh  call used for DECCARA and DECRARA to ensure
    that  trailing blanks which are part of the rectangle are repainted
    (report/analysis by Dennis Filder).
  * when  resetting  the terminal, ensure that the cursor shape also is
    reset,  e.g.,  if DECSCUSR has been used to modify the cursor shape
    for  an  xterm  which was started with the underlined cursor option
    (report/analysis by Luis Javier Merino).
  * prevent  DECSCUSR  from  blinking  the  cursor  if  the cursorBlink
    resource is “never” (report by Vladimir D Seleznev).
  * invert  the sense of DECSDM, to correspond with VT382 manuals (lsix
    #41).
  * update tables in wcwidth.c based on Unicode 14.0.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  7 23:16:27 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to Patch #367 - 2021/03/26
  * add  OSC 22 to allow programs to select different pointer cursor at
    runtime.
  * change  configuration for no-return functions to use _Noreturn when
    it  is  available, because clang --analyze does not properly handle
    the gcc noreturn attribute.
  * add  cursorTheme resource to provide a way to enable or disable the
    cursor theme feature.
  * modified  CopyWait  event retries to use shorter sleeps, to improve
    responsiveness (tmux #2556).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 11 06:51:46 UTC 2021 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Updated to Patch#366 2021/02/10

  * correct   a  compiler-warning  fix  in  patch  #352  which  allowed
    sign-extension of coordinate values (report by "CismonX").
  * correct  upper-limit for selection buffer, accounting for combining
    characters (report/testcase by Tavis Ormandy).
    (CVE-2021-27135 bsc#1182091)
  * with alwaysHighlight true, xterm does not properly track focus. The
    screen->select   FOCUS  flag  remains  always  on,  which  prevents
    bellIsUrgent  from  working, as the urgent WM_HINT flag is only set
    in  setXUrgency()  when  the  window  is  not  focused. Fix this by
    updating screen->select in unselectwindow() regardless of the value
    of always_highlight (patch by Jiri Bohac).
  * improve  fix  for  interaction between SRM and ENQ (report by Grant
    Taylor).
  * build-fix   for  --with-Xaw3dxft,  needed  when  --with-toolbar  is

- Updated to Patch #365 - 2021/02/03

  * amend fix for “word” selection in patch #364 to limit that to
    the insert-selectable action, which reads data from the screen. This
    restores the interactive behavior where double-clicking on a
    “word” would make subsequent selection extensions by words as
    well as suppressing some boundary-checks (report by David Wolfskill,
    FreeBSD #253225).

- Updated to Patch #364 - 2021/02/02

  * add -fc option.
  * correct/improve limit-checks for SRM versus ENQ from patch #344 (report by Tom Szilagyi).
  * enable XftFont resource in Xaw3dxft configuration (patch by Tavis Ormandy).
  * improve quoting/escaping in build-scripts per shellcheck.
  * add libpcre2-posix to the packages tested for --with-pcre2 option, needed with Fedora (report by Tomas Korbar).
  * correct a typo in manual page, and note that KeepClipboard may not be compiled-in (report/patch by Sean C Farley).
  * corrected boundary-checks for “word” selection used in onNClicks resources (report by Tavis Ormandy).
  * update to autoconf-2.52-20210101, to improve shellcheck warnings.
  * improve configure check for desktop categories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to Patch#363 - 2020/12/26
  * disable groff hyphenation in generated html when using man2html.
  * change SCS “&4” Cyrillic to non-NRCS, per VT520 manual.
  * amend fix for SCS in patch #198 to remove DEL rather than converting
    it to a space (report by Thomas Wolff).
  * modify state transitions for selecting character sets to eliminate
    an ambiguity between the “A” used in VT220 versus VT320.
    improve error recovery when selecting characters by resetting to US
    ASCII when no suitable encoding is found, e.g., attempting to use
    an NRCS sequence when NRCS is not enabled.
  * turn off hyphenation in “.txt” conversion, prompted by groff changes.
  * add VT5xx ISO Latin-2 (prompted by discussion with Thomas Wolff).
  * amend change from patch #361 to event-handling in CopyWait to handle

  * add call to loadColorTable to get the visual information needed to
    decode BE RGBA32 color format (patch by Leandro Lupori).
  * modify the resource-parsing for disallowedPasteControls and similar
    lists of names/numbers to recognize “~;” (tilde) for cancelling a given name/number.
  * add ENQ, EOT and NUL to default for disallowedPasteControls.
  * change default for disallowedPasteControls to omit the tab character
    (suggested by Harald Dunkel).
  * fix swapped height/width in regisScreenSize and maxGraphicSize resources
    using "auto" value, from patch #314 (report by Anton Lavrentiev)
  * revise patch #362 change for shift-modifier versus mouse protocol
    and select/paste by adding resource shiftEscape, which can be enabled
    via a control sequence (prompted by discussion with Matthijs van Duin).
  * simplify/improve ifdef in trace code for using a separate set of files
    for each run of xterm.
  * add options -r and -t to vttests/query-color.pl to show the 6-digit
    RGB code and actual colors.
  * add nel to xterm-basic terminfo.
  * alter vttests/modify-keys.pl to omit HTML reference links to the
    modified-keys table where no keycode was available.
- includes Patch #361 - 2020/10/14
  * treat the return value of strerror as readonly (patch by Philipp
    Klaus Krause).
  * modify event-handling in CopyWait to work around hanging while writing
    large amounts of text to an active icon and at the same time iconifying/
    deiconifying (report by Dave Kemper).

  * improve manual page description of scrollbar resources (report by Brian Lindholm).
    correct ifdef for menu entry for active-icon, when initializing
    it with toolbar configuration.
  * add preprocessor option to makefile to set internal definition of
    pixmaps directory to match the install-configuration (FreeBSD #250036)
  * cleanup of calls to free, removing checks for null (Walter Harms)
  * add fallback actions pointer-button and pointer-motion which handle
    events for the mouse control-sequences protocol if the select-related
    translations are omitted with *omitTranslation:select (prompted by
    discussion with "Ergus")
  * amend rule for using shift-key to override mouse-protocol for select/
    paste to limit that feature to mouse-buttons which are actually
    bound to select/paste actions (prompted by discussion with "Ergus").
  * corrected mapping in special case for repainting wrap-marks when viewing
    the scrollback area.
  * use separate GCs for showWrapMarks feature, to work around cursor
    coloring change in patch #345 (report by Paulo Silva de Alíbano).
- includes Patch #360 - 2020/09/20
  * mention decGraphicsID in ctlseqs.ms (suggested by Thomas Wolff).
  * modify pixel-coordinate mouse reponse to use as origin the VT100-
    window rather than the underlying widget, which includes the scrollbar (report by Thomas Wolff).
  * add configure option --disable-print-graphics (Ross Combs).
  * add test_ptydata to “make check” rule.
  * minor fixes for ctlseqs.ms (report by Jean-Marc Bourguet).

Tue Jun  9 11:02:07 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add Recommends: xorg-x11-fonts-legacy, since the default font
  is now available in that package. If the font is not available
  it will fall back to use a font installed in xorg-x11-fonts
  and it can also use truetype fonts, thus the Recommends instead
  of a Requires (related to boo#1169444)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  5 13:03:22 UTC 2020 - Callum Farmer <callumjfarmer13@gmail.com>

- Fixes for %_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 26 12:15:08 UTC 2020 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Patch #353 - 2020/02/01

  - amend change in patch #352 for button-events to fix a case where some followup events were not processed soon enough (report/patch by Jimmy Aguilar Mena).
  - handle MappingNotify X event, to improve recovery when switching keyboard configurations using xkbcomp (prompted by discussion with Frank Mosch, Debian #661295). There is more work needed here, possibly in the X libraries.
  - improve discussion of mouse-mode in ctlseqs.ms (suggested by Igor van den Hoven).
  - further improve checks for Xft max-advance-width to take into account fonts which use two cells for ambiguous width characters. Also improve the time used for these checks (reports by Yuri Pankov, Frank Mosch).
  - fix a few spelling errors reported by codespell (report by Jens Schleusener).
  - modify run-tic.sh to prefer development version of ncurses since changes to terminfo file in patch #345 rely upon bug-fixes in ncurses (prompted by discussion with Will Senn).

- Patch #352 - 2020/01/16

  - adjust fontsize data to handle a minor inconsistency from recent Xft versions (Debian #880407, adapted from patch by Vincent Lefevre).
  - add a table to the manual page description of forceBoxChars to alert the reader to the special characters aside from “line-drawing” which are drawn directly when this resource is set (Debian #931305).
  - improve checkXft logic which attempts to detect fonts whose max-advance-width is inconsistent with the actual glyph widths. For some fonts, it is necessary to check additional characters (report/analysis by Jan Engelhardt).
  - improve configure-checks for X headers and libraries on recent MacOS, which has moved those files under /usr/X11.
  - improve portability of iconify/deiconify feature by taking into account some window managers which manipulate the EWMH _NET_WM_STATE property, adding/removing _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN rather than actually minimizing the window (prompted by discussion with Jörg Breitbart).
  - improve workaround from patch #287 for the -iconic option when configured with toolbar by postponing the extra request for minimizing the window to the end of menu-initialization.
  - modify xevents special-case for mouse-events to include button-events so that the meta key by itself can generate button-events (report/analysis by Mattias Engdegård).
  - amend SGR-stack change from patch #348 to not associate bold attribute with background color (report by Nicholas Marriott).
  - fix copy/paste error in manual page (patch by Larry Hynes).
  - add definitions in xterm_io.h so that GNU/Hurd will use posix_openpty (patch by Samuel Thibault).
  - build-fix in debug-tracing, for esctest.
  - updated autoconf macros
  - update config.guess

- Patch #351 - 2019/11/17

  - correct logic in property_to_string for deciding when to fallback from UTF-8 decoding to ISO-8859-1 decoding, broken in xterm #350 (FreeBSD #241961).
  - add -report-icons to help-message.
  - improved autoconf macros:
    -   CF_ADD_LIBS: the change to filter out duplicates caused this to append rather than prepend. revise to fix that.
    -   CF_GCC_VERSION and CF_GCC_WARNINGS: move checks to distinguish icc/clang from gcc from the macro which handles the --enable-warnings option, to make this work without-warnings for the inline-checks.
  - update config.guess, config.sub
  - correct status in XTGETXRES replies when the resource was not found.
  - fix some gcc, cppcheck, clang and coverity warnings.
  - guard call to RequestResize from the struct-notify event handler to prevent recursion in the Xft+buffered workaround in some cases when doing manual resizing rather than resizing via escape sequences (reports by Stefan Assman, Mike Thornburg).
  - amend the workaround for Xft+buffered blanking by moving the switch to bitmap-fonts to account for differences in font metrics between bitmap- and TrueType-fonts (report by Stefan Assmann).
  - improve the note on the xterm-rep terminfo entry (prompted by discussion with Sven Joachim).

- Patch #350 - 2019/11/02

  - modify html/svg dump to not ignore zero'd/blank cells.
  - align terminfo file with ncurses, e.g., add xterm+osc104 block.
  - improve discussion of modifyOtherKeys in manual page and in ctlseqs.ms.
  - add vttests/modify-keys.pl script to illustrate the modifyOtherKeys resource (prompted by discussion with Bram Moolenaar).
  - various improvements to ctlseqs.ms, as part of autogenerating links for the website.
  - update manual page default for saveLines resource default value (Branden Robinson, Debian #913815).
  - add command-line option -report-xres to show the values of the VT100 widget X resources when initialization is complete.
  - add a control sequence which, like tcap-query, allows an application to inspect most X resource settings of the VT100 widget.
  - adjust some optional features to enable them in the imake configuration as they would be by default via the configure script.
  - add null-pointer checks to improve error recovery when bitmap fonts are missing or corrupt (report by Jonne Ransijn).
  - correct the condition for deleting the EWMH window-title property, i.e., if UTF-8 titles are disabled, rather than if an update to the EWHM property found no change (report by Sven Joachim).
  - build-fix for the case when configure --enable-trace is used without --enable-warnings (report by Sven Joachim).
  - fix a few minor bugs found with Coverity.
  - add a check in property_to_string to avoid translating UTF8_STRING or COMPOUND_TEXT into Latin-1 when UTF-8 encoding is active, e.g., when pushing onto the title-stack while switching to the alternate screen.
  - build-fix for the --disable-doublechars configure option (report by Brian Lindholm).

- Patch #349 - 2019/09/22

  - add graphic context to support bold+italics (patch by Quinn Strahl).
  - document window properties in the manual page.
  - improve title-string feature:
    -   if any of allowC1Printable, utf8Title or titleModes hint that an application might send a title-string encoded in UTF-8, check if that is the case, and if it is recodable into ISO-8859-1, use that for the ICCCM-style title.
    -   check if the title given by a control sequence happens to be already encoded in UTF-8, to avoid double-encoding (FreeBSD #240393).
    -   Make sameName resource work for the EWMH titles.
    -   Modify menu-state of utf8Title to be consistent with the utf8 source, i.e., setting the EWMH properties automatically when UTF-8 is active.
  - reorganize text-drawing to make it possible to investigate using Xft to implement VT100-style double-sized characters. While doing this, made a workaround for apparent Xft bug which loses its drawable state when switching from 132 to 80 columns.
  - improve font-warning messages by showing which are derived rather than directly from resource settings (suggested by Tomas Korbar). Also filter repeated font-warning messages, to accommodate broken X configurations.
  - fix an inconsistency between failure to load derived wide font versus failure to load derived wide-bold font (Redhat #1679790). That relies upon the “:unscaled” property which is broken in some distributions (however, recent Debian and the BSDs such as MacOS work).
  - updated autoconf-252 to check X11R7 include/lib directories found on some older configurations.
  - set a graphic-context for border when double-buffering is active; to prevent the border color from changing when switching to reverse-video.
  - build-fix for --disable-ziconbeep, which conflicted with the new double-buffer configuration (report by Brian Lindholm).
  - fix loop-limit for lookup of fullscreen resource broken in xterm #347 (report by Scott Bertilson).

- Patch #348 - 2019/07/22

  - update window-manager hints when exiting Tek4014 mode (Debian #932569, patch by Jonathan Irwin).
  - fix a misformatted printf in report-sgr.pl.
  - add configure check for termios types, to improve compiler-warnings.
  - ensure that when resetting margins, to also reset DECLRMM. This affects DECCOLM, DECALN (although DEC STD 070 mentions only top/bottom margins), and DECSTR.
  - corrected order of reset/move when setting DECCOLM, and make it more consistent by always resetting margins, rather than only when the mode is changed (report by James Holderness).
  - compile-in double-buffer support by default, changing the configure option to set the default resource value for buffered to true or false.
  - take in account the reverse-video state when computing the filler-color used when clearing the screen in double-buffering configuration.
  - correct logic for filtering scrollbar-updates when buffered resource is compiled-in but not enabled (report by Paul Lampert).
  - improve state saved/restored for cursor-save and SGR stack features.
  - improve description of 1006 and 1005 mouse modes, to avoid implying that they use character-parameters (report by Bryan Christ).
  - explain in ctlseqs.ms that some of the numeric keypad keys were xterm extensions rather than VT100/VT220 terminal features (prompted by discussion with Thomas Wolff).
  - explain in ctlseqs.ms how the DEC windowing extension is supported by xterm.
  - add 28 rectangular editing to the primary response (suggested by Thomas Wolff).
  - fix a typo, improve wording in ctlseqs.ms (Thomas Wolff).
  - fix internal column-parameter when SL or SR is used with left/right margins (patch by Thomas Wolff).
  - fix off-by-one in VT52 graphics character mapping (patch by Thomas Wolff).
  - use _X_UNUSED, etc., when available as a fallback for GCC_UNUSED, etc., to reduce compiler warnings when building with imake.
  - update config.sub

- Patch #347 - 2019/06/30

  - fix a few minor bugs found with Coverity.
  - improve double-buffering for scrollbars combined with scrolled text; add bufferedFPS resource to control the maximum rate of screen updates (report by Mike Thornburg).
  - improve fixes for DECCRA handling of double-width characters (patch by Martin Hostettler).
  - improve discussion of ECMA-48's typographical error for SD in ctlseqs.ms (prompted by report by Martin Hostettler).
  - correct off-by-one in parameter limit-check for DECCRA (report by Martin Hostettler).
  - modify saveCellData to handle case where double-width character is partially copied; that should be blanked (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
  - add resource buffered to allow enabling/disabling double-buffered mode.
  - two fixes for the double-buffer configuration, prompted by MacPorts' switch to double-buffering (patch by Mike Thornburg, MacPorts #58313):
    -   ensure that the needSwap flag is set after drawing TrueType text
    -   corrected the drawable-parameter used for the bar-cursor
  - modify ScrnRefresh to ignore a case where the left/right halves of a double-width character have been set to different video attributes. The attribute to use is in the left-half (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
  - correct a limit-check for DECCRA in case the target lies off-screen (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
  - documentation errata (report by Thomas Wolff).
  - reset flags including wraparound and reverse-wrap when switching to VT52 mode, while noting that DEC's standard documentation leaves that behavior undefined (report by Thomas Wolff).
  - ensure that italic font is turned off on hard/soft resets (report by Martin Hostettler).
  - improve responsiveness to X events while processing HTML or SVG dumps (report by Martin Hostettler).
  - replace logic in wcwidth.c for detecting double-width characters with binary-search table generated using updated uniset (report by Robert Ross).
  - add test-driver for wcwidth.c to simplify comparison with system's wcwidth.
  - ensure that window-manager name comparisons work when active-icon is enabled, since CSI13t uses the window-manager name (report by Glenn Golden, Arch #62818).
  - trim a stray “experimental” in one of the comments about the tcap-query feature, which has been a supported feature since 2008 (see patch #238).

- Patch #346 - 2019/05/27

  - update description of the “default” setting for the renderFont resource to match the behavior in patch #261 (Debian #862042).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  3 04:26:19 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Patch #331 - 2017/12/30

    characters were not used, when specifying it via the utf8Fonts
    resource.
  * replace constant 10msec delay for next X event with new resource
    nextEventDelay, and reduce that to 1msec to accommodate faster
    machines than used when -hold was implemented in 1999
  * add scroll-to action, which simplifies binding a key to scroll
    to the beginning or end of the saved-lines
  * add building blocks for alternate screen and/or title-stack
    features in the terminfo file.

    keepClipboard resource setting and corresponding menu entry.
  * fix an inconsistency between private mode 12 (the AT&T 610
    cursor blink) and DECSCUSR: the former relied on having the
    cursorBlink resource set initially to enable the escape sequence,
    while the latter does not.
  * add private modes 13 and 14, as well as resource cursorBlinkXOR
    to allow better control over the cursor-blinking state

  * add wide-attributes to DECRQSS reply for SGR.
  * add private mode 1046 to help with scripting applications.
  * correct expression used for readline-flags in DECRQM; to test
    the current flag rather than information stacked within the
    same variable.
  * correct typo in ctlseqs.ms reference to ISO-8613-6
  * fix lintian warning for test-package.
  * fix typo in DECRQSS for SGR 48, which printed the foreground

    38/48 in response
  * improve workaround for Debian #542434 by using the font's
    maximum width when no ISO-8859-1 glyphs are provided
  * work around a special case of Xft's mismanagement of its
    cached data by adding a check before the -report-fonts option

  * improve manual page description of regex option for onXClicks
    resources
  * add directColor resource.
  * additional manpage macro cleanup
  * add optional support for direct-colors
  * improve legacy/NRC character set mapping:
    + enable alternate NRC set designators for French and French
      Canadian, ‘9’ and ‘f’ respectively, as documented in ctlseqs.
      (‘9’ is documented for VT510, ‘f’ is a Kermit feature).
    + correct the Unicode value in the DEC Technical table to show
      capital delta.
    + referring to
      * http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm/table2-3b.html
      * http://vt100.net/docs/vt320-uu/appendixe.html
    + add entries for the DEC Supplemental Graphics table to display
      0x28/0xa8 as ¤ and 0x5d/0xdd as Ÿ.
        referring to
      * http://www.vt100.net/charsets/technical.html
      * alter the Unicode values used for 0x2b through 0x2c to use
        curly braces to work with the “middle” parts displayed with
	0x2f and 0x30.
    + modify the VT220 “Supplemental” table, giving a hint that it
      was probably meant to be “Supplemental Graphics” and is the
      same as VT320's table.
  * quiet a few font-warnings when a derived fontname cannot be
    opened, overlooked in refactoring of font resources in patch #328
  * correct error response for DECRQSS broken in cleanup of
    Coverity reports in patch #288
  * improve DECRPM responses by returning mode not recognized for
    modes which may not be settable due to the selected
    decTerminalID resource
  * correct logic for print-immediate action, and enable
    corresponding menu entry
  * add configure option --with-pcre2
  * fix a misspelled subsection title in ctlseqs.ms and add a note
    regarding blink which was rendered as bold in X11R6. Blinking
    text was implemented in Patch #60.
  * fix typos in xterm.man
  * fix typography in xterm.man
  * fix typo in INSTALL
  * add xterm-direct terminal description based on changes
    introduced in patch #277, and relying upon ncurses RGB extension.
  * modify xterm-new terminal description to use ECMA-48 REP,
    reflecting its use in xterm since patch #32 (1996).
  * clarify comment in ctlseqs.ms regarding blink: it has been
    part of xterm since patch #60 (1998).
  * update ftp URLs in documentation.

  * define also wideBoldFont to get rid of a warning (bsc#1067530) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 15:29:31 UTC 2017 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #330 - 2017/06/20
  * updates for ReGIS (Ross Combs):
     + remove redundant text command error check which broke
       T(B) and T(E).
     + retain the loading alphabet number across multiple “L”
       commands.
     + add S(T) delay handler.
     + fix some color handling error messages.
     + add stubbed-out macrograph handling.
     + use fragment_remaining() and fragment_consumed() instead
       of manually checking position / length in various places.
     + rename some local variables in string / extent / option
       parsing
     + wrap some long lines.
     + move macrograph command handling out of the top-level.
  * add a summary of the italic fonts loaded to -report-fonts
    option.
  * modify the font-lookup for italics to allow for “-i-” if no
    match is found with slant “-o-” (prompted by patch by Ben
    Wong).
  * change default values for mkSamplePass and mkSampleSize to
    reflect generally-improved locale support in various
    operating systems (FreeBSD #219800).
  * modify wcwidth.c to return -1 for non-Unicode values, and
    adjust a couple of blocks to better match assumptions about
    ambiguous-width characters in other implementations. Also
    modify wcwidth.c to support configurable soft-hyphen, so
    there is no drawback to using this version rather than a
    system wcwidth.
  * amend change made in patch #328 for cursor-visibility to
    handle case where an application is updating the
    reverse-video state (FreeBSD #219800).
  * update tables of combining and ambiguous-width characters in
    wcwidth.c based on Unicode 10.0.0.
  * build-fix for --enable-sixel-graphics without
    --enable-regis-graphics (reports by Sven Joachim, FreeBSD
    #219945).
- Patch #329 - 2017/06/12
  * add control sequences for reading the Sixel and ReGIS
    graphics sizes (suggested by Ben Wong).
  * add a workaround for wcwidth returning -1 for characters
    which should have been printable (FreeBSD #219800).
  * fix a bug in font initialization from patch #328 (FreeBSD
    #219800).
  * fix a special case in HideCursor which assigned a bold font
    to the slot used for normal font in changes for italics in
    patch #307 (Debian #858304).
  * updates for ReGIS (Ross Combs):
     + Strings specified with no command are used as "comments".
       Print these in the log when tracing.
     + Catch attempts to use "alternate display" mode (AKA
       "blink") from the GIGI, but do not implement it.
     + The T(M) command should only multiply the height by 10,
       not 20.
     + Make the S(E) command reset more state than just the
       screen contents.
     + Remove two rotation variables which were only being
       printed.
     + Numerous minor fixes and comment updates in the R
       command.
     + Unknown R command option names trigger an empty response.
     + Fix the output position after printing rotated text (it
       was missing the the sign before).
     + Fix the position change with pixelvectors and rotated
       text (the rotation transform was not being applied).
     + Update the TODO list and remove a verification FIXME
       (slanted text positioning is correct as is).
     + Emulate the approximately 1.4x enlargement for text which
       isn't rotated at right angles.
     + Only update the color planes specified in the plane mask
       (the W command's F option).
  * fix a bug introduced by the changes to font information in
    patch #328. When processing the "checkfont" option of the
    locale resource, the program referred to the request data, to
    an array which was only allocated in the new/result widget
    (report by H Merijn Brand).
  * fix a missing assignment initialization to make the utf8
    resource control whether escape sequences to enable/disable
    UTF-8 mode are allowed.
- Patch #328 - 2017/06/01
  * revise parser for charClass resource, making these
    improvements:
     + accept octal and hexadecimal values
     + allow embedded whitespace
     + allow the class after colon to be optional, e.g., to
       clear class settings for a range of characters.
  * add command-line option -report-charclass.
  * fix most lintian warnings about test-package
  * add eraseSavedLines resource.
  * document DECSED 3 in ctlseqs.ms (report by Ben Longmans).
  * improve integration between configure-events and updates for
    reported screensize, in particular when switching between
    vt100 and tek4014 modes.
  * modify selection-highlighting of reverse-video text to keep
    that distinct, e.g., by reversing the selection foreground
    and background colors as one would expect. This fixes a
    "useless" case in the description of highlightColorMode.
  * improve fix for Debian #759734, addressing a case where
    non-colored cursor would be invisible against reverse-video
    (see patch #311).
  * updates for ReGIS (Ross Combs):
     + the "H" option of the "T" command should multiply by 10,
       not 20.
     + display unknown glyphs as a solid block.
     + given a succession of text-direction options, use the
       last.
     + fix the direction of ReGIS slanted text so that negative
       values produce oblique output .
     + fix the ReGIS text direction option to only rotate
       characters when no following size option is used.
  * update terminfo to better match corresponding entries in
    ncurses, e.g., u8 pattern to match the VT220, VT420, etc.,
    primary responses, as well as adding smxx and rmxx.
  * fixes from Jörg Sommer:
     + corrected a trace-message regarding maximum
       graphics-size; it used the similar ReGIS maximum size
       which might not be configured.
     + in do_select_regex, clear selection if there is no match.
       If the regex does not match anything around the cursor,
       the selection returned must be empty, otherwise the whole
       line is treated as a match. This way the command defined
       by exec-selectable will not be executed if there is no
       match.
     + modify limit in do_select_regex to include the character
       at the cursor in the match, making it easier to type
       something and then hit the key to trigger
       exec-selectable.
     + If exec-selectable or insert-selection is triggered by a
       mouse button click, the position of the mouse pointer
       should be used. This makes it easier to address any
       position on the window and it makes it possible to use
       the mouse, e.g., for applications such as mutt where you
       cannot move the cursor.
  * modify DECRC to save/restore xterm's last-column flag used to
    control wrapping behavior rather than manipulating DECAWM
    (report/analysis by Mattias Engdegård).
  * add configure option --enable-terminfo-env to use the value
    set by --with-own-terminfo for the $TERMINFO environment
    variable. That variable was set automatically for HPUX, but
    would be useful in other systems, e.g., for Solaris (request
    by Jeff Wieland).
  * fix a race condition when setting up a signal handler to
    timeout if opening /dev/tty hangs (patch by Tobias
    Stoeckmann).
  * review/cleanup resources which were not in the manual page
    (report by Maxwell Anselm):
     + add manual page description as needed.
     + drop resource name for menuBar, as unnecessary.
     + modify fallback numeric value for regisScreenSize
       resource to match that for maxGraphicSize.
  * updated configure macros CF_ADD_CFLAGS, CF_CC_ENV_FLAGS,
    CF_GNU_SOURCE, CF_MATH_LIB, and CF_XOPEN_SOURCE from other
    program-changes.
  * update config.guess, config.sub
  * change “maximum screensize” assumed by resize to 9999x9999,
    to accommodate people using the Unreadable font.
  * drop Utility from default value of --with-desktop-category
    (Debian #780176).
  * widen the configure script pattern used for finding related
    ".desktop" files, including “Terminal”
  * several minor improvements to font utility functions:
     + provide for later modification to implement font-sets by
       parsing the font resources as comma-separated lists.
     + parse -fn and -fa similarly, using “x:” and “xft:”
       prefixes for font name/family strings to distinguish
       between XLFD and Xft font specifications.
     + use loops to iterate over font classes
     + use getters/setters for font data to allow for on-demand
       lookups.
     + make the debugging trace for missing glyph less verbose
       since that interferes with the -report-fonts option.
     + refactor xtermLoadFont to make it clearer how some fonts
       are derived from others, e.g., bold, wide.
     + make the triggering and suppressing of font-warnings more
       consistent by storing the last state in the widget.
     + reduce font-warnings by checking for repeated warnings.
  * add vttests/query-status.pl
  * add vttests/closest-rgb
  * add special case for displaying soft-hyphen if it happens to
    fall at the right margin, and omitting similar case such as
    the BIDI markers, where a zero-width character is neither a
    control character nor a combining character (Debian #844325).
  * modify logic for OSC 52, manipulate selection data, to update
    the selection-time to include the latest X events. This fixes
    some cases where the selection was invalid, e.g., after an
    event due to focus-follows-mouse (report/testcase by Stephane
    Chauveau).
  * revise macro CastMallocN as new macro TextAlloc to make
    explicit use of sizeof(char) (prompted by patch by Cade
    Foster).
  * add “Mouse Ops” menu entry and related resources to allow
    runtime disabling/enabling of the mouse protocol escape
    sequences (discussion with Bob Proulx).
  * improve discussion of mouse actions versus protocol in the
    manual (discussion with Bob Proulx).
  * improve discussion of environment variables in the manual,
    pointing out where some features (such as termcap and the
    System5 COLUMNS and LINES variables) are used rarely, mainly
    to support legacy applications.
  * add examples of translations resource for select/paste, and
    for font-size changes to the manual.
  * minor reordering of some entries in ctlseqs.ms for
    consistency (report by Arran Ubels).
  * add -s option to 256colors2.pl and 88colors2.pl, to
    demonstrate modifying the “system” colors 0–15.
  * omit XFT_SPACING property from call to XftPatternBuild, to
    work around a bug in fontconfig for handling Google Go fonts,
    whose names sort in an order not expected by fontconfig,
    causing the request for a monospaced font to return italics,
    e.g.,
        $ fc-match 'Go Mono:spacing=monospace'
        Go-Mono-Italic.ttf: "Go Mono" "Italic"
        (report by Giacomo Boffi on Stackoverflow).
  * modify minstall.in to improve a workaround added to the
    manual page in patch #182 to avoid having the C preprocessor
    used in the imake configuration strip out the comments in the
    character classes section (reports by Ted Unangst, Anthony J
    Bentley).

Mon Nov 21 14:54:30 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #327 - 2016/10/07
  * add a check in the function which handles end-of-line
	wrapping to ensure that C1 controls are allocated one column
	when allowC1Printable is set (Debian #738794).
  * use consistent error-checking after strtol calls, fixes a
	case where a query with OSC 6 did not ensure there was a
	valid color number (report by Alex Smith).
  * add -baudrate option, for testing ncurses.
  * always generate the CASE_xxx symbols in VTparse.h and
	Tekparse.h, as part of a change to improve debug-logging.
	This makes the build always depend upon awk.
  * modify allowC1Printable to disallow codes 160-254 as being
	equivalent to codes 32-126 when parsing escape sequences
	(Debian #839220).
  * amend fix from patch #326 for TrueType fonts to exclude the
	hidden character used for double-width cells (report by Grady
	Martin).
  * fix a typo in ctlseqs.ms

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  5 12:42:33 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #326 - 2016/09/25
  * updated appdata file (report by Richard Hughes).
  * improve discussion of the different terminal emulations
    provided by xterm in the manual page.
  * add examples of setting the icon title with/without the
    window title in the manual (Debian #833984).
  * correct a limit-check when using a numeric value for extended
    Booleans e.g., *fullscreen:3 rather than a name such as
    *fullscreen:never.
  * add action allow-bold-fonts
  * improved formatting fixes for manual page, using script to
    find mismatches in spelling of resources, actions and menu
    entries.
  * improve documentation of logging resources.
  * fix a special case of flickering cursor by adding
    GraphicsExpose to the list of event types that should not
    trigger making the mouse cursor visible (patch by Joe
    Peterson).
  * correct initialization of line-drawing in VT52-mode,
    overlooked in changes for patch #297 (report/patch by Ben
    Wiley Sittler).
  * minor clarification of form-feed versus line-feed in
    ctlseqs.ms (suggested by David Kemper).
  * amend fix for Debian #738794 to restore a check for missing
    characters which are not combining characters. Also fill in
	a corresponding special case for TrueType fonts
	(Debian #827905).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 11:06:22 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #325 - 2016/06/05
  * improve manual page discussion of function keys (discussion
    with Ross Combs).
  * further improve fix for Debian #545220 in patch #248, to
    avoid conflict with combining characters (Debian #738794).
  * improve -hold option to avoid 100% CPU usage with NetBSD
    after closing the shell, which makes subsequent checks for X
    input events fail (prompted by patch by Pierre Pronchery).
  * review #ifdef statements, listed those which do not have a
    configure option in xtermcfg.hin.
  * fixed one case where the menu sensistivity for Print-All
    Immediately and Print-All on Error was not properly ifdef'd.
  * modify terminfo entries for 16-, 88- and 256-color to reset
    palette with rs1 capability.
  * accept legacy value of -kt as synonym for the oldXtermFKeys
    resource, and extend the full-reset logic to use the keyboard
    type set via -kt.
  * modify ioctl calls for I_PUSH to first check if the module
    has been added, using I_FIND. This is needed for newer
    Solaris libraries with c11 support (adapted from patch by
    Alan Coopersmith).
  * add check in getXtermCombining to ensure that combining
    characters were allocated (report by Tor Andersson).
  * add configure option --without-xinerama to allow suppressing
    the extension (Gentoo #580936).
  * update keysym2ucs.c based on Unicode 9.0
  * fixed most cppcheck --enable=all warnings, including for
    style (prompted by report by David Binderman). There was one
    bug-fix:
     + RGB least-squares computation in allocateClosestRGB used
       only one ordinate
  * add cppcheck to lint-like programs in configure script and
    makefile.
  * updates for SIXEL and ReGIS (Ross Combs):
     + Fixes some const correctness issues and points out an
       array lifetime issue
     + Sixel drawing should still happen after an error if some
       commands have been processed
     + Tiny steps toward reporting ReGIS input

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 14 11:18:47 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #324 - 2016/03/10
  * updated configure macro CF_LD_RPATH_OPT from ncurses changes.
  * provide alternate fix for Juha Nurmela's report by turning on
    POSIX signals if _POSIX_C_SOURCE is at least one. This is
    done to improve the behavior if a direct child process
    receives a STOP signal.
  * revert change to CF_POSIX_C_SOURCE from patch #323
    (reports by Ashish Shukla, Christian Weisgerber).
- Patch #323 - 2016/03/07
  * updated appdata and desktop files to add keywords (report by
    Richard Hughes).
  * modify configure macro CF_POSIX_C_SOURCE to accommodate some
    systems, e.g., FreeBSD, which have separated their
    implementation specific preprocessor symbols from the POSIX
    ones, requiring both to be defined (report by Juha Nurmela).
  * change the directory to the current working dir of the child
    process in exec-formatted and exec-selectable actions (patch
    by Alexander Pohoyda).
  * correct typo in xterm.man (patch by Larry Hynes).
  * correct typo in ctlseqs.ms (report by Shriramana Sharma).
  * add feature to support XHTML and SVG screen dumps (patch by
    Jens Schweikhardt).
  * correct response to DECRQSS when terminal id is less than 400
    (patch by Iwamoto Kouichi).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 10:58:33 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #322 - 2016/01/02
  * fix regression due to incorrect fix for compiler warning when
    allocating storage for /etc/shells (reports by Ashish Shukla,
    Debian #809646).
- Patch #321 - 2015/12/31
  * add resource keepClipboard, escape sequence and action
    keep-clipboard.
  * add optional feature to capture text copied to clipboard at
    the time of copying rather than at the time the clipboard
    contents are requested for pasting (patch by Milan Mehner).
  * improve a special case where the -e option was used to pass a
    single-quoted command via luit, by wrapping it in a “sh -c”
    (report by Keith Hedger).
  * minor fix for type-cleanliness when allocating storage for
    /etc/shells (Tobias Stoeckmann).
  * fix a typo in manual page (Dan Church).
  * fix minor file-descriptor leak; after calling openpty, the
    slave's file descriptor is not needed (report by Juha
    Nurmela).
  * editorial change to ctlseqs.ms (report by David Gomboc).
  * minor updates for autoconf macros.
  * update config.guess, config.sub
- vttest 20140305
  * save/restore color enable-flag for menu 11.6 in a couple of
    places so that the ISO-6429 tests do not reset it
    unexpectedly.
  * amend the REP test to not reset colors if it happens to be
    run via the menu entry for BCE-related tests.
- vttest 20140116
  * cosmetic changes (suggested by Itay Chamiel):
    + clear screen just before resetting SCS in menu #3 character
      sets, in case a VT100 emulator does not simply ignore VT220
      G2/G3 selections when it does not implement them.
    + add check for maximum operating level before deciding
      whether to send a DECSCL to set it to VT100-level.
    + adjust starting point of items for menu #9 "Test of known
      bugs" to avoid overwriting part of the description of the
      test.
  * add configure check for -Wlogical-op to gcc-warnings
  * update config.guess, config.sub
- vttest 20130915
  * when NRCS is active, suppress ISO Latin-1 from menu to avoid
    confusion with British NRCS.
  * do not highlight ISO Latin-1 for NRCS, since it is a
    96-character set, not applicable to NRCS.
  * correct position of ruler for SD and REP screens, which
    obscured the result.
  * expand menu 11.6.6 to demonstrate bce with top-level menus 1
    and 2 in addition to the existing menu 8.
  * correct description for DA response 24; it denotes VT320.
  * correct highlighting for French NRC mapping; "`" is not
    mapped.
  * add port-files from FreeBSD for test-builds.
  * add highlighting information for VT320 Portuguese NRC
    mapping.
  * add highlighting information for VT220 DEC Supplemental NRC
    mapping.
  * updated configure-macros to add msys changes from ncurses
    20130907.
  * update config.guess, config.sub
- vttest 20130818
  * modify character-sets screens to optionally highlight the
    characters which do not correspond to ISO-8859-1.  This makes
    the National Replacement Characters easier to see.
  * modify DSR cursor-position report to check if the terminal
    accounts for origin-mode.
  * support --datarootdir option in makefile.in, to match
    configure script updates.
  * updated configure macros:
    + change from byacc for autoheader
    + improved checks for gcc attributes
    + improved checks for gcc version
    + miscellaneous fixes in CF_XOPEN_SOURCE
  * update config.guess, config.sub
- vttest 20120603
  * change cursor-position before IL/DL in "Test of VT102-style
    features with BCE (Insert/Delete Char/Line)" to demonstrate
    whether the terminal sets the cursor to the first column as a
    side-effect, as noted in VT220 reference manual.
- remove vttest-config_update_aarch64.patch since the current
  vttest sports newer config version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  2 13:50:49 UTC 2015 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #320 - 2015/08/28
  * correct documentation for %t format (report by Martin
    Tournoij).
  * add %R for consistency to exec-formatted() and
    insert-formatted() actions.
  * add %r format to exec-formatted() and insert-formatted()
    actions (patch by Martin Tournoij).
  * Amend fix for Debian #794201 (report forwarded from Christian
    Jachmann by Emanuel Haupt, Debian #797008).
- Patch #319 - 2015/08/19
  * add a section to ctlseqs.ms discussing control sequences and
    ECMA-48, to explain why C1 controls do not occur in the
    decoded characters from UTF-8 byte streams (prompted by
    discussion with Poul-Henning Kamp).
  * modify check for cursor-theme from patch #301 to also check
    if the resource Xcursor.theme is set to a nonempty value
    before fallback to xterm's own dummy theme (request by Robert
    Kloefkorn).
  * explain in ctlseqs.ms that some keys which normally send
    SS3-prefixes are changed to CSI-prefixes if key-modifiers are
    passed as parameters (report by George Nachman).
  * correct double-free of font information when multiple
    problems are found, particularly for the wide fonts loaded
    via the -wc option (report/testcase by Nelson Beebe).
  * make configure option --enable-builtin-xpms actually work
    (report by William Bulley).
  * correct combination of -ls and -e options for utempter
    configuration (Debian #794201).
  * NetBSD build-fix for OPT_RENDERFONT versus OPT_SHIFT_FONTS
    (patch by Matthew Green, forwarded by Thomas Klausner).
  * fix a few minor bugs found with Coverity.
  * update pixelvector handling (Ross Combs):
    + split pixel-based and coord-based functions with common
      parts factored out to a "raw" function
    + add a "step" variant which loads a single PV digit
  * make the graphic dirty upon resize or clear, fixing some
    missing refreshes (patch by Ross Combs)
  * fixes scrolling to use user coordinates and move in the
    correct direction (patch by Ross Combs)
  * several fixes/improvements for ReGIS whitespace and
    page-handling (patch by Ross Com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 19 09:03:43 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 318
  * rename new(er) configure option --enable-initial-erase to 
    --enable-pty-erase, since that conflicted with an existing 
    option (report by Jens Schweikhardt).
  * fix cut/paste error in --with-builtin-xpms configure option 
    (reports by Jens Schweikhardt, Ross Combs).
  * fix minor formatting issue in xterm manual (report by Jens 
    Schweikhardt).
  * eliminate unnecessary "#(vi" markers in autoconf macros by 
    using "(" to begin case-statement cases (suggested by Jens 
    Schweikhardt).
  * minor fixes to improve const usage (Ross Combs).
- Add pkgconfig and groff as dependency as configure is looking 
  for them

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 27 16:45:16 UTC 2015 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #317 - 2015/03/27
  * adapt example for exec-formatted from Lukáš Zapletal's
    webpage to manual (Debian #780008).
  * add a short usage section to the xterm manual, including
    notes on setting the window title (Debian #742477).
  * revise a change made to ICH in patch #314 to address
    limit-checks (reports/testcases by Zoltán Kéri and Joe
    Peterson, also reported by Christian Weisgerber).
- Patch #316 - 2015/03/07
  * revert change to make DCH honor top/bottom scrolling margins.
    For the record, both the VT420 and VT520 reference manuals
    incorrectly state that "DCH has no effect outside the
    scrolling margins."
  * fix regression in DCH introduced in adjustment for
    limit-check in patch #315 (report/testcase by Zoltán Kéri,
    also reported by Christian Weisgerber).
  * correct default value for configure option
    --enable-initial-erase; it should be "False", but in patch
    #315 it was "Maybe", which differed from default set in patch
    #192.
- Patch #315 - 2015/03/02
  * change default for --enable-narrowproto for Cygwin to "no" to
    better match contemporary configurations (report by Jens
    Schweikhardt, prompted by discussion).
  * provide OSC 106 as an alternative to OSC 6, avoiding conflict
    with one of Terminal.app's undocumented escape sequences
    (report by Egmont Koblinger).
  * fix an off-by-one in comparison when autowrap and left/right
    margins are combined (report by George Nachman).
  * modify DECBI and DECFI to work outside the left/right
    margins, since the vague VT520 reference manual could support
    that interpretation (suggested by George Nachman).
  * correct response for DECSCUSR in DECRQSS (report/analysis by
    George Nachman).
  * add DECSLRM to list for DECRQSS in ctlseqs.ms (report by
    George Nachman).
  * improve limit-checks versus assert's in the debugging version
    (reports by George Nachman).
  * correct a problem with multiple writes to the right-margin
    when autowrap is turned off (report by George Nachman, also
    reported in Gnome #744819 by Ulf Magnusson).
  * modify DCH to honor top/bottom and left/right margins (report
    by George Nachman).
  * correct off-by-one in comparison so that DL honors left/right
    margins (report by George Nachman).
  * correct logic of DECSCL, which always set 8-bit controls as a
    side-effect (report by George Nachman).
  * correct loop limit for DECSED 1, when DECSCA is enabled
    (report by George Nachman).
  * fix a entry in csi_table for “$”, needed for CSI [ $ z
    (report by George Nachman).
  * remove restriction from patch #279 changes on DECIC and DECDC
    to left-right mode (report by George Nachman).
  * correct PID value returned in response to DECRQCRA
    (report/analysis by George Nachman).
  * fix an ifdef'ing problem, where --disable-dec-locator would
    turn off logic needed for DECIC and DECDC (report by George
    Nachman).
  * correct order of parameters in report for CSI 1 9 t, which
    gives the screensize in characters (report by George
    Nachman).
  * add null pointer checks for a case in DECCRA where part of
    the target rectangle lies outside the screen limits (report
    by George Nachman).
  * remove extra "6" for selective erase from DA1 response
    (report by George Nachman).
  * support Xinerama screen specification in geometry parsing
    (patch by Nicolas George).
  * add configure option --enable-initial-erase to set
    ptyInitialErase consistently with manpage, as well as adding
    a table in manpage to clarify the relationship between the
    resources related to the backarrow key (Debian #775952).
  * add configure --enable-builtin-xpms to simplify compiling-in
    the icons introduced in patch #284 (prompted by discussion
    with William Bulley).
  * fix/improve autoconf macros:
    + CF_WITH_APP_DEFAULTS, add paths for OSX
    + CF_WITH_MAN2HTML, configure option "--with-man2html"
      provides "man2html" as alternative to groff's man/html
      conversion
  * fix some minor issues in manpage (Jens Schweikhardt).
- Patch #314 - 2014/12/28
  * fix a minor bug in the termcap-specific version of resize
    when the lines or columns values are at the very end of an
    incomplete termcap string (prompted by coverity report).
  * improve paste64 feature (report by Olaf Rogalsky)
    + fix “p;” command in paste64.pl example.
    + modify _OwnSelection to allow the paste64 control to cause
      primary/clipboard selections to be disowned and cleared.
    + omit an extra "=" used in padding, to make the base64
      response a multiple of four characters.
    + modify _ConvertSelectionHelper to not stop converting on
      embedded nulls in the primary or clipboard selection. That
      makes the behavior consistent with cut-buffers. Nulls are
      not passed on to the application because they are used for
      separators in the X library calls that convert
      XTextProperty values.
  * add configure option --with-man2html to allow an alternative
    to groff's man/html conversion.
  * review and modify resource-settings which can be set via
    control sequences, etc:
    + add OSC 6, to enable/disable colors set via OSC 5, without
      changing the color assignments (prompted by patch by Ingo
      Brückl).
    + add command-line option -itc for italics.
    + add colorIT and colorITMode for italics, like colorBD,
      etc.
    + guard allowPasteControls against modification by editres.
  * change passedPty from fixed-length to allocated to ensure
    that it is long enough to hold the -S option value (report by
    Ben Longbons).
  * improve ReGIS graphics initialization (Ross Combs):
    + add a new string resource to set the default ReGIS font.
    + fix a caching problem where the font name wasn't taken into
      consideration when looking up cached metrics.
    + enables use of fractional values in coordinates (which in
      turn allows setting the coordinates to something like
      [0,1][1,0])
    + doubles the minimum ReGIS graphic to 200x200
    + set the default ReGIS image size to "auto"
    + fix some swapped width/height parameters in TRACE messages
    + add support for scaling and mirrored coordinate systems to
      the screen address command
    + sets a minimum ReGIS graphics size of 100x100 -- smaller
      address ranges will be scaled up
    + reset the image if either the width or height is zero
      (which should happen together or not at all, but switching
      the logic gets rid of some parentheses)
    + adds support for alternate screen coordinates (just
      offsets, not inverted coordinates or scaling)
    + keeps the graphics state across ReGIS calls unless P1 or P3
      entry codes are used
    + changes loops to continue after parsing whitespace to allow
      trailing whitespace
    + fixes some incorrect character casts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  5 15:57:44 UTC 2015 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #313 - 2014/11/28
  * add regisScreenSize resource setting to allow custom
    screensizes for ReGIS graphics (prompted by discussion with
    Scott Froebe).
  * fix some minor issues in manpage (Jens Schweikhardt).
  * improve ReGIS font-handling (Ross Combs):
     + remove "random junk" generation for unknown characters
     + add xterm extension to load user glyphs for alphabet 0
     + add xterm extension to specify loading an alphabet from a
       font by name
     + fix bug with use of empty alphabet slots which caused slot
       0 to be clobbered
     + update/clarify ReGIS-related comments
     + add DECprint extension for printing/clearing the screen
       (only clearing is performed)
  * improve ReGIS colorspec conversion (Ross Combs):
     + avoid some floating point math for colorspace conversion
     + move two copies of colorspec parsing to a single function
     + change colorspec parsing to handle components being out of
       order or with spaces and commas between them
     + add support for an extension where RGB components can be
       given instead of HLS
  * improve use of const, e.g., for the LineData pointers (patch
    by Ross Combs).
  * clip of graphics that overlap the scrollback buffer and alt
    screen (patch by Ross Combs).
  * amend change to focus-change events in patch #287 to limit it
    to suppressing the reset of the urgency-hint, because some
    useful FocusOut events were lost (report by Joe Peterson).
  * modify dpkg build-script to configure xterm-dev as an
    x-terminal-emulator alternative.
  * extend the --with-xterm-symlink feature to make symbolic
    links for the other programs and scripts.
  * minor fix to vttests/resize.pl to avoid undefined variable
    when receiving broken/missing response, e.g., from mrxvt.
  * change the way that ReGIS graphics are refreshed (patch by
    Ross Combs):
     + it pre-composes any overlapping graphics to avoid
       unnecessary and flickering draws
     + it adds a three-dimensional lookup table for RGB -> pixel
       values and uses this across all graphics
     + it draws in line segments when there is a run of the same
       color
     + in cases where there are no transparent parts, it uses an
       XImage to draw
     + it hooks into the double-buffering support if it is
       enabled (though this doesn't seem to get rid of all
       flicker).
  * This has the effect of reducing flicker and speeding up
    redraws.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  5 13:41:57 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add libX11-devel, libXft-devel and libXrender-devel
  BuildRequires: the configure script silently disables XRENDERFONT
  support if the dependencies are missing (boo#911683).
- Add an extra check after configure to ensure we do not lose this
  support accidentally ever again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 19 12:57:27 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Remove xorg-x11 and xorg-x11-devel BuildRequires: there is no
  need, and it causes that xterm requires itself to build through
  indirect requires (xdm, xinit).
- Own the directory %{xappdefs}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 16 12:10:56 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Split the desktop launcher from the binaries: there are users
  that want to clean up their desktop launchers and also remove
  xterm launchers (but xterm is a deep dependency of xinit, used
  for fallback situations). The package 'xterm' is the 'app
  launcher', which depends on xterm-bin. Installing xterm does, as
  it did in the past, pull a FULL package installation. But the
  user will be free to remove xterm and only keep xterm-bin (once
  the dependencies in xinit are corrected as well) (boo#906598).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 14 09:19:26 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- No longer perform gpg validation; osc source_validator does it
  implicit:
  + Drop gpg-offline BuildRequires.
  + No longer execute gpg_verify.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 12 18:39:01 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add xterm-desktop-item-in-gnome-utilities-appfolder.patch to
  group xterm desktop item in the Utilities app-folder in the
  GNOME shell. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 29 14:12:20 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #312 - 2014/09/28
  * undo change to do_select_regex() in patch #311
    (reports by H Merijn Brand, Sven-Haegar Koch, Debian #762978).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 25 08:28:22 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #311 - 2014/09/18
  * mention xclip in manpage as an alternative workaround for
    copying clipboard data, noting that selectToClipboard (from
    patch #209) is the recommended approach (Debian #639094).
  * correct comparison in do_select_regex() of working position
    against starting column.
  * correct initialization for regular-expression feature of
    exec-selectable and insert-selectable actions (Debian
    #758633).
  * modify logic for exec-formatted and insert-formatted actions
    to ensure that the formatting occurs just after the selection
    is received (Debian #758633).
  * account for state of reverse-video in special case of cursor
    coloring (Debian #759734).
  * fix a sign-extension problem in ReGIS support, as well as
    correcting a case where ignored-characters were not really
    ignored (patch by Ross Combs).
  * Enable the "Escape Sequence" menu entry when an OSC 50 is
    received. Also disable it if the escape sequence specifies no
    font (Debian #760208).
  * improve fix for the fontsel menu entry from patch #304:
    because the recovery used the "current font", it would fail
    if one first selected a valid font, then an invalid font
    (Debian #760207).
  * correct an off-by-one in limit-check for ScrnLimitChar
    function (report by Egmont Koblinger).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 17 09:39:07 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- remove unnecessary colour tweaks which cause strange artifacts
  in the ReverseVideo mode (bnc#395154, bnc#865340)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 12 15:56:01 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- fix SUSE naming in the package files (bnc#888995) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 31 10:39:19 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #310 - 2014/07/25
  * update package/freebsd files based on xterm #309 port
  * adapt changes from Minux3.2 which ported xterm #197, to allow
    building on that platform both using imake as well as using
    the configure script
  * update precompose.c based on Unicode 7.0
  * build-fix for --with-Xaw3dxft option (report by Emanuel Haupt)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 15 13:02:26 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #309 - 2014/07/13
  * modify configure script to work around debris left by XQuartz
    upgrades.
  * modify test-package scripts to enable ReGIS graphics.
  * improvements/additions to ReGIS graphics, e.g., drawing text
    (Ross Comb).
  * add --with-Xaw3dxft, to link with Xaw 3d xft library
    (Stephen P Wall).
  * amend reset for cursor-shape to take into account
    cursorUnderline resource (report by Christian Weisgerber).
  * update config.guess, config.sub

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 23 08:25:46 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #308 - 2014/06/19
  * corrected font used for clipping double-width bitmap fonts
    from patch #307 changes to work around mis-scaled fonts
    (Debian #752947).
  * improve wording of a warning message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 18 09:50:15 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #307 - 2014/06/17
  * fill background for top/bottom parts of
    double-width/double-height characters, to cover occasional
    gaps due to bitmap font-scaling (report by Egmont Koblinger).
  * amend resets for keyboard-type, pointer-mode and title-modes
    from xterm #305 changes to account for resource settings
    (Debian #751351).
  * modify printAttributes feature to include new SGR codes.
  * modify cursor show/hide logic to work with italic fonts.
  * do clipping and filling for a case with bitmap-fonts and
    italics when the font server returns only a "close" match
    (report/testcase by Egmont Koblinger).
  * adjust loop comparison for underlining to display underlines
    on 5x8 font as in patch #304 (Debian #750733).
  * amend fix for Freedesktop #15979 (Debian #750733).
  * amend xterm.appdata.xml, making it validate with current
    schema.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 12 16:50:21 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- a special changelog entry containing the full patch file name
  instead of the short one that appears in the real update commit
  (previous changelog entry): xterm-decomposed_bitmaps.patch,
  that appeases the checks in the openSUSE:Factory project in
  OBS. These checks (and thus also this entry) are of the utmost
  importance since they ensure that a package changelog can be
  used instead of a proper source version control system and sane
  patch header comments. It also adds lots of important
  information on top of the usual boring features & fixes
  descriptions nobody is really interested in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 10 14:45:33 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Fix Xerror failures on ppc64le (bnc#881131)
  [-decomposed_bitmaps.patch]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  4 15:36:21 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #306 - 2014/06/03
  * fixes for display-errors in new SGR codes (report by Egmont
    Koblinger).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  3 19:29:08 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #305 - 2014/06/02
  * add xterm.appdata.xml (request by Richard Hughes). By the way,
    none of the released validators yet handle <licence> tags (or
    <metadata_license>, etc).
  * fix memory leaks in bitmap font-name caching.
  * other changes to hard-reset behavior:
    + reset keyboard-type on hard-reset.
    + reset pointer-mode (pointerMode) on hard-reset
    + reset title-modes (titleModes) on hard-reset
    + reset cursor-shape on hard or soft-reset
    + reset LEDs on hard-reset.
    + reset DECSACE on hard-reset.
  * reset bracketed-paste mode on hard-reset (suggested by Egmont
    Koblinger).
  * modify UTF-8 decoder to account for allowC1Printable resource.
  * revise getXftColor to ensure that its sequence number will not
    overflow in long-running sessions.
  * minor fix to selection to prevent hidden character from being
    returned in selection data (report by Egmont Koblinger).
  * add -sh to help-message.
  * amend check for incomplete fonts to always decide that a
    character is missing if the font lacks per-character metrics
    (prompted by Freedesktop #15979).
  * minor reorganization to implement “filler” SGR features. There
    are no established applications which rely upon these; some
    people find them amusing.
    + separate bits used to manage drawing state from
      attribute-bits.
    + implement SGR codes 2, 3, 9, 21 and their corresponding
      resets.
    + add configure option --disable-wide-attrs to disable the
      feature.
  * additional changes for ReGIS support (patch by Ross Combs):
    + fix some arc drawing bugs and add support for pattern
      shading.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 22 09:04:25 UTC 2014 - gber@opensuse.org

- enable support for sixel graphics originally introduced with
  patch #294

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  5 19:31:19 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #304 - 2014/05/03
  * add debugging check for parsing table entries, fixed a few
    inconsistencies.
  * handle utmp/utmpx strings consistently with new function that
    null-pads unused locations.
  * build-fix for imake configuration with FreeBSD 9 and later,
    to account for replacing utmp with utmpx.
  * improve handling of the fontsel (font-selection) menu item:
    + initialize the menu entry differently if the toolbar
      configuration is used, i.e., enabling it without attempting
      to use the current selection as a font name. Because of the
      way in which the toolbar is setup, this attempt usually
      failed, and would result in a warning.
    + if the menu action fails, e.g., no font can be loaded for
      the given selected name, then recover by resuming with the
      current font. Before, the recovery went to the default
      font. That was done to work around missing bitmap font in
      patch #276.
  * document OSC 119 in the control sequences listing (report by
    Egmont Koblinger).
  * modify special handling of XF86Paste or SunPaste keysyms (see
    patch #227) to use the standard shift/lock modifiers in case
    those are, for example, used in level 3 in an XKB file (patch
    by Matthieu Herrb).
  * configure macro updates:
    + drop the -no-gcc option from CF_INTEL_COMPILER
    + modify CF_XOPEN_SOURCE to suppress the check for defining
      _XOPEN_SOURCE on Solaris
  * reduce bss storage used for ReGIS/Sixel modules, as well as
    cleanup storage usage in other modules.
  * initial changes for ReGIS support (patch by Ross Combs):
    + document control-sequences
    + separate ifdef's for sixel and color-register features
    + add configuration for VT382

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 07:00:52 UTC 2014 - meissner@suse.com

- Patch #303 - 2014/03/06
  * improve check for /etc/shells to allow its entries to be symbolic
    links.
  * fix a regression in patch #302 fixes relating to interaction of
    SHELL and XTERM_SHELL variables (Debian #740919).
  * improve manpage discussion of use of /etc/shells for validating the
    SHELL environment variable.
  * further improve the approximation for color map by ignoring bits
    which would not be applied by the rgb masks for the current visual
    (report by Joe Peterson).
  * add -report-colors to usage-message (report by Joe Peterson).
- Patch #302 - 2014/03/02
  * amend  approximation for color map introduced in patch #277 to make
    that apply only to TrueColor (adapted from patch by Joe Peterson).
  * add -report-colors option, to show colors as they are allocated.
  * fix some gcc -Wcast-qual warnings.
  * correct app-defaults location for CentOS-4 in xterm.spec
  * improve  check  in  minstall.sh for X manpage's section number; add
    sample  dependencies  for  the  relevant  documentation  package to
    packaging test-scripts (prompted by Novell #779474).
  * modify sample build-scripts for dpkg and rpm to ensure that vttests
    scripts are uncompressed and executable.
  * modify  Perl scripts in vttests to use env to find Perl rather than
    relying  on /usr/bin/perl This makes the sample scripts usable with
    NetBSD and other systems using pkgsrc.
  * amend  check  from  patch  #301  for valid shell to permit existing
    SHELL  value  to  specify  the  shell;  clarify the behavior in the
    manpage (report by Emmanuel Thome).
  * amend  change to wide-character processing from patch #257 to allow
    switching  to/from  UTF-8 encoding if the utf8 resource was not set
    to "always" (report by Honza Maly).
  * fix  incorrect  free  from  patch #301 changes, if explicit program
    without -e option is a valid shell (patch by Romain Francois).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 20 14:20:46 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #301 - 2014/01/19
  * OSC 104 and 105 did not accept parameter to reset a specific
    color (patch by Egmont Koblinger).
  * add configure check for initgroups, and use that function to
    complement its use of setgid (prompted by patch by Miroslav
    Lichvar).
  * improve manpage description of scrollbar translations versus
    the vt100 translations (Debian #723573).
  * add a few paragraphs to manpage explaining the implications
    of xterm's reliance on X Toolkit for command-line parsing.
  * modify cursor-theme logic to check if the environment
    variable XCURSOR_THEME is set to a nonempty value before
    constructing a dummy them (prompted by similar check added in
    OpenBSD CVS).
  * add check for a case where TrueType bold font is missing a
    glyph where the non-bold font has it. Temporarily switch to
    the non-bold font to draw the glyph (report by David
    Demelier).
  * minor documentation fixes for ctlseqs.ms
  * only set SHELL environment variable to programs found in
    /etc/shells (prompted by patch/report by Al Poole).
  * build-fix, when --disable-wide-chars --disable-boxchar is

- Patch #300 - 2013/12/03
  * amend workaround for Xcursor library from patch #298; the
    suggested solution for Debian #466704 fell afoul of a bug in
    Xcursor which treated an empty value for Inherits= as a valid
    theme—and resulted in a stack overflow due to unbounded
    recursion. Certain environments such as XFCE4 exposed the
    bug. A related report in Debian #531679 was closed without
    following the recommendation to limit stack recursion in this
    library (reported by Sergey V Dyatko, Debian #731269).

- Patch #299 - 2013/12/01
  * fix regression in line-drawing from patch #297 changes for
    NRCS exposed by change to assumeAllChars resource in patch
    #298 (report by Markus Waldeck).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 29 13:38:23 UTC 2013 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #298 - 2013/11/27
  * quiet a warning about ambiguity when -h command-line option
    is parsed, since -help is used rather than the options
    mentioned in the message. This warning was caused by fixes in
    patch #272.
  * remove an extra check for keypad-mode which interfered with
    the patch #280 modifyKeyboard feature for the numeric keypad
    (report by David Conners).
  * change default for assumeAllChars resource (Debian #725682).
    There are unresolved issues with Terminus fonts, e.g., Debian
    #722017.
  * add -report-fonts command-line option and reportFonts
    resource to optionally report the fonts which are loaded, and
    their metrics such as the number of missing glyphs.
  * work around Xcursor library to make pointerColor resource
    work as documented (Debian #466704, analysis by Vincent
    Lefèvre).
  * amend change from patch #297 for ASCII-equivalents to ensure
    that missing characters which happen to be double-width are
    padded to the expected number of columns. Also, correct the
    choice between normal/wide Xft fonts used when checking for
    missing characters (reported by WU Yue, Debian #728949,
    Gentoo #491334).
  * modify sixel-graphics drawing to account for scrollbar width
    (report by Mario Edelmann).
  * fix remaining issue with DECNRCM; the British character set
    was confused with ISO Latin-1 (report by Hayaki Saito).
  * build-fix for --disable-boxchars configure option.
  * updated configure macros, from ongoing work on lynx and
    ncurses.
  * update config.guess, config.sub

Fri Sep 20 08:57:18 UTC 2013 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #297 - 2013/09/10
  * modify check for missing cells in bitmap font to work around
    terminus 10646 encoding, which is mostly missing, add
    assumeAllChars resource to provide the older behavior.
  * modify macros used to check for missing cells in bitmap fonts
    to pick up a long-overlooked improvement made to xfd in
    XFree86.
  * improve workaround for groff versus ASCII-equivalents; patch
    #185 had overlooked Xft configuration (reported by anonymous
    user on Arch Linux forum).
  * review/extend DECNRCM support (prompted by report by Hayaki
    Saito asking about the two "A" codes).
     + make pasting of DECNRCM data work by translating the pasted
       data into the selected encoding.
     + limit mode changes to VT220 and up.
     + ignore SCS for National Replacement Characters if DECNRCM
       is not set.
     + add tables and logic to decode SCS controls ending with "%"
       and one additional character. This expects the parsing of
       SCS to VT320.
     + also added parsing for SCS of DEC Supplemental and DEC
       Technical, which are for VT2xx and VT3xx respectively.
     + implement VT220 Multinational character set "GR" aka "DEC
       Supplemental Graphic".
     + DEC Technical character set based on vt100.net description.
     + implement Portuguese NRC.
     + provide for temporarily switching to/from NRC mode from
       UTF-8 mode when DECNRCM is set or reset.
  * minor fix to assert's found while testing examples from
    ttdoda's slrm-test1.txt.
  * modify DECLRMM to not update the cursor position (report by
    Iwamoto Kouichi forwarded by Hayaki Saito).
  * modify cursor-position report to take origin-mode into account
    (report by Hayaki Saito, see also iTerm2 pull request 129).
  * correct off-by-one comparison in when handling carriage-return
    at left margin (patch by Iwamoto Kouichi, forwarded by Hayaki
    Saito).
  * improve handling of faceName resource when a "size=" property
    is embedded in it, by using that size to replace the default
    faceSize resource. This lets xterm honor the other faceSize
    resources (report by Jens Schweikhardt).
  * improve OSC 52 selection-data by setting its timestamp to
    correspond to the most-recent event received by xterm, to
    ensure that calls to XtOwnSelect succeed even if the selection
    is manipulated solely through the keyboard (prompted by patch
    by Richard Tollerton).
  * change configure-script defaults for "luit" and "wide-chars"
    options to match the values used in the imake configuration,
    to lessen user surprise if they are accustomed to building
    xterm using imake(report by Andries E Brouwer).
  * improve the imake-related configuration's check if xterm is
    started in a locale that uses UTF-8 encoding. Before, this
    checked the locale settings only for "UTF-8", now it checks
    ignoring case for "UTF-8" and "UTF-8" (report by Andries E
    Brouwer).

Fri Jul 12 08:46:01 UTC 2013 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #296 - 2013/07/10
  * improve experimental sixel feature (patch by Ross Combs).
  * modify delimiter in configure macro used to add a library
    after a given library to avoid confusion with -Wl
    pass-through options to linker (NetBSD #48031).
  * fix quoting in expression used to trim extra libraries from
    patch #295 changes (report by Thomas Klausner).

- Patch #295 - 2013/07/06
  * adjust order of libraries to work around incomplete symbol
    resolution when using --as-needed option (ArchLinux #36047).
  * minor fix for plink.sh, for IRIX64.

- Patch #294 - 2013/07/05
  * add note in ctlseqs.ms for CPR response pointing out a
    potential point of confusion with the string sent by a
    modified F1 key (suggested by Bram Moolenaar).
  * improve plink.sh by checking if the linker supports the
    --as-needed option (suggested by David Philippi).
  * improve clearing for private mode 1049 when switching to the
    alternate screen (Debian #711758).
  * amend fix from patch #292 by removing now-unneeded chunk
    which introduced problem in selection (Debian #714527).
  * add definition to optionally override compiled-in class for
    xterm from makefile, needed for test-packages.
  * add configure option --enable-sixel-graphics
  * add experimental support for sixel graphics (patch by Ross
    Combs).

- Patch #293 - 2013/05/27
  * modify sample xterm.spec to use newer icon
  * add configure option --with-icon-symlink to work around
    systems which map icon requests for to a single "xterm" icon,
    but neglect to install the icon needed for window decorations
    (report by H Merijn Brand).
  * improve parameterizing of sample xterm.spec
  * amend fix for printer from patch #280, removing a reset of the
    signal handler for SIGCHLD (report by Joe Julian).
  * set environment variable XTERM_FILTER if a locale-filter is
    used.
  * enable DEBUG logic when --enable-trace configure option is
    given.
  * improve description of initialFont, set-vt-font and
    set-tex-text in manpage (Debian #707899).
  * fix regression from patch #292; selecting a word that ended at
    the right margin without wrapping would not select the last
    cell (report by Christian Weisgerber).

Fri Apr 26 11:06:37 UTC 2013 - meissner@suse.com

- Patch #292 - 2013/04/25
 * add limit-check when double-click selects a word; if the saved-lines
   were scrolled back and the word selected wrapped at the screen's lower
   right corner, an assertion was triggered (patch by Taketo Kabe).
 * correct limit-check in unsaveEditBufLines, fixing a case where
   enlarging the terminal size could show a blank line where there
   actually is available text (patch by Bertram Felgenhauer).
 * add PasteControls feature to allowWindowOps which by default
   disallows pasting control characters other than formatting such as
   carriage return (discussion with Hayaki Saito).
 * fix typo in ctlseqs.ms for DECRQM response (patch by Emanuele
   Giaquinta).
 * update  default  shown  in  configure  --help  message  for
   --with-terminal-id option (patch by Andres Perera).
 * rename script/preprocessor variables used for substituting the
   backarrowKey  default value for consistency (patch by Andres
   Perera).
 * set umask to 077 before creating debugging-trace files.
 * add configure option --disable-openpty to control whether openpty()
   may be used in preference to posix_openpt().
 * improve workaround from patch #279 for BSD systems which do not
   complete initialization until both sides of the pseudoterminal are
   opened, by preferring openpty() function over posix_openpt() when
   available (report by Christian Weisgerber).

- Patch #290 - 2013/02/12
  * revert of patch #282 change was incomplete (report by Jim Reisert).
  * fix typo in manpage (report by Vincent Lefevre).

- Patch #289 - 2013/02/08

  * revert the patch #282 change which restored "lost" text after
    shrinking/growing the screen size. If the screen was updated between
    the two resizing operations, unexpected text might be shown at the
    end (report/testcase by Joe Peterson).
  * reverse the arrow-keys sent for alternateScroll to match the usage
    in browsers (suggested by Dieter Roelants).
  * modify mouse reports to consistently indicate motion events whether
    or not a button is pressed. Old behavior (since patch #127 modified
    encoding for wheel mouse) showed only that the button was released
    if no button had been pressed (report by Andy Koppe).
  * correct and improve behavior for SGR 1006 mouse protocol on button
    release in any-event mode. Initial implementation in patch #277 left
    internal state showing the last button pressed when reporting motion
    events. It now keeps track of all buttons which have been pressed
    and released, showing the lowest remaining button by number in the
    response (reports by Hayaki Saito, Andy Koppe).
  * fix inconsistency between TermColors and OscTextColors enums which
    interchanged values for tektronix cursor color and highlight
    foreground in control sequences in patch #225 (report/patch by
    Peder Stray).
  * fix inconsistent use of noreturn-attribute in Exit function which
    interfered with analysis by clang.
  * remove incorrect free used in computation of XTERM_SHELL variable,
    from Coverity fixes in patch #288 (FreeBSD #175782).
  * add --with-valgrind option to configure script for consistency with
    my other programs.
  * update table of ambiguous width characters in wcwidth.c based on
    Unicode 6.2.0
  * update table of combining characters in wcwidth.c based on Unicode
    6.2.0
  * update precompose.c based on Unicode 6.2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 25 10:52:06 UTC 2013 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #288 - 2013/01/09
  * fix a special case in ShowCursor where the foreground and
    background colors of the current position are the same. In
    that case, choose the further of the window's foreground and
    background colors for the cursor color.
  * modify alternateScroll feature added in patch #282 to use
    either CSI or SS3 according to the cursor keys application
    mode setting, to simplify using it in vi, etc. (suggested by
    Dietar Roelants).
  * revise manpage for resize to clarify the changes which resize
    may make to the terminal settings as well as to the terminal
    itself.
  * remove code such as struct ttysize, used for SunOS 3 and 4.
  * modify configure script and makefile to check for groff and
    suppress groff-specific rules if groff is not found.
  * modify ctlseqs.ms and makefile to work around bugs in grohtml
    which cause ".png" files to be truncated when producing html
    documentation.
  * modify suffix rules for "make docs" to make the names of the
    generated ".png" files predictable, helping to work around
    longstanding problems with this feature of groff-none of its
    releases work for all of xterm's tables..
  * correct typo in ctlseqs.ms for DECIC and DECDC; the character
    preceding the final "~" is an ASCII single-quote "'" rather
    than a space (report by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
  * update CF_GCC_VERSION macro, handling both Debian and Darwin.
  * improve configure script checks for the
    --with-desktop-category option. After patch #280 changes, if
    no value was given for this option, and no existing desktop
    files found for comparison, the incorrect "auto" value was
    passed into the generated desktop file (report by Julien
    Cristau).
  * modify sample build-scripts to disable check for imake due to
    code-rot in Xorg.
  * add -v command-line option to resize, reporting the same
    version string as xterm and the two shell-wrappers.
  * make name-transformation apply to other occurrences of resize,
    other manpages.
  * special-case the name-transformation in xterm's manpage in the
    NAME section so that the result works with makewhatis (report
    by Julien Cristau).
  * modify install-rules for manpages to put each program's
    respective transformed name into the header rather than
    xterm's.
  * remove deprecated files: proto.h, os2main.c
  * minor fixes based on Coverity scan, including:
    + correct caching of Atom value for the font menu's
      "Selection" entry.
    + ensure that utmp/utmpx calls do not depend upon trailing
      nulls in the ut_id and ut_line values.

- Patch #287 - 2012/11/25
  * fix  a case where in_put() loop could continue when it has found an
    X  event  rather  than  the pty, causing the pty-read to be delayed
    (patch by Balazs Kezes).
  * add  option  to  pointerMode  resource  and  corresponding  control
    sequences  to  allow  text-cursor  to  remain hidden if the pointer
    leaves/enters  the  window  via  accelerator  keys. Ordinary motion
    within the window restores the pointer (prompted by patch by Balazs
    Kezes).
  * remove   special   case   of  modifiers  for  the  Mode_switch  and
    XK_ISO_Level3_Shift  from  patch  #223.  Verified that the conflict
    which  this  was  intended  to  resolve  does not happen for normal
    compose- or modeswitch-handling (prompted by patch by Balazs Kezes,
    Debian #638694).
  * modify  the  handling  of focus-change events to ignore those whose
    detail  is  NotifyPointer,  since  those  are  sent  in addition to
    focus-change  events  directed  to the old/new windows having focus
    (prompted by patch by Balazs Kezes to prevent the urgency-hint from
    being reset in this scenario).
  * modify  description  of iconName in manpage to make it clearer that
    this  resource does not specify the filename of an icon (discussion
    with Ian Collier).  * modify  iconHint resource to allow suppressing
    the built-in icon by setting this to "none" (discussion with Ian
    Collier).
  * make -iconic option work with the toolbar configuration.
  * correct  initialization  of  window  manager  hints used to set the
    icon-pixmap.  That  detail  from patch #282 overwrote state used to
    control the -iconic command-line option (report by Ian Collier).
  * fix paste64 feature for the case where the selection comes from the
    current terminal. The selection callback can happen after the reply
    is  partly  built, making it necessary to flush the reply-buffer to
    keep things in the proper order (report by Ailin Nemui).
  * reject  command-line  options  which are longer than the options in
    xterm's table, to avoid mismatches (Redhat #875305).
  * correct attribution for patch #282 changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 12:04:34 UTC 2012 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #286 - 2012/10/29
 * fix minstall.in to work with "make docs" rule, so that patch
   number appears in the corresponding generated documentation.
 * modify minstall.in to keep the name shown in the heading
   consistent with any renaming, e.g., for test-builds.
 * check for misconfigured printerCommand resource on the first
   use, warn and disable it if it does not specify an executable
   command (Debian #691642).
 * improve check for window-manager name needed to establish
   usable default for activeIcon resource. This works around a
   scenario where gdm does incomplete cleanup, leaving window
   properties that refer to windows which no longer exist 
   (Redhat #869959).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 25 13:47:52 UTC 2012 - meissner@suse.com

- Patch #285 - 2012/10/23
 * add/adapt FreeBSD ports files for test-building.
 * modify  minstall.sh to use the patch-number and date in the manpage
   footer.
 * add  check  for  failure  to  allocate the fg/bg colors at startup,
   e.g.,  misconfiguration. Work around by setting both to the default
   colors (suggested by Scott Bertilson).
 * amend  change  for  patch  #280 which added modifyKeyboard, to make
   modifyOtherKeys work (report by Ailin Nemui).
 * add query-colors.pl example for OSC 4.
 * correct   mis-applied  fix  for  minstall.sh  (report  by  Miroslav
   Lichvar).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 16 14:49:09 UTC 2012 - meissner@suse.com

-Patch #284 - 2012/10/14
 * amend configurability changes for icons from patch #283, moving the
   new  functionality  to the iconHint resource to avoid conflict with
   existing  uses of the iconName resource in the Shell widget (report
   by Emanuel Haupt).
 * fix documentation errata (reports by Miroslav Lichvar):
   + correct manpage default for allowTcapOps (see patch #243
   + modify  documentation  for configure --enable-backarrow-key to
     match the script (see patch #280).
   + fix  typo  in  minstall.sh  in  patch  #283,  which  made  the
     leading-cap "Xterm" become "xterm" (patch by Miroslav).
 * fix  two  typos  in configure.in from patch #283 changes; one broke
   the --regex configure option (report by H Merijn Brand).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 11 11:56:44 UTC 2012 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #283 - 2012/10/09
  * modify makefile and script to generate appropriate renaming
    s/xterm/xterm-dev/ for test-package's manpage.
  * improve makefile rules for installing/uninstalling pixmap
    files, to include the newer mini- and filled- variants.
  * clarify change in manpage regarding patch #282 change to
    always set a window-decoration icon, even if iconName is not
    set.
  * add a fourth flavor of window-decoration icons,
    "filled-xterm" for a monochrome xterm with filled interior.
  * use shape-mask to improve contrast of the window-decoration
    icons.
  * minor changes to icon colors to improve contrast on
    bright-mud backgrounds.
  * drop configure checks for memmove versus bcopy, and strerror
    function; all currently tested platforms support these.
  * cleanup configure macros, as done in byacc 20121003.
  * improve configurability of the built-in icon selectable via
    the iconName resource.
  * update config.guess, config.sub

- Patch #282 - 2012/09/28
  * improve configure check for XkbKeycodeToKeysym, fixing a regression
    on some older systems in the patch #280 changes.
  * add  clarification in manpage for alwaysBoldMode and veryBoldColors
    resources (prompted by Derek Martin question about using the former
    with TrueType fonts).
  * add  alternateScroll  resource  and corresponding control sequences
    which  modify  the  scroll-forw  and  scroll-back actions: when the
    alternate screen is displayed, wheel mouse up/down will send cursor
    keys (Debian #683942).
  * improve  rendering  for the case when a Unicode character is absent
    in  the  bold  font  but  present in the normal font by temporarily
    falling back to the normal font (Debian #359006, Debian #408666).
  * provide  configure  option  --enable-double-buffer  and  ifdef's to
    allow  comparisons  with/without double-buffering. The default uses
    normal buffering.
  * add  feature  to  optionally  scroll  current page before clearing,
    ontrolled  by  resource setting cdXtraScroll (prompted by patch by
    Richard Wagenblast):
  * integrated  patches  from  Arch  Linux  forum  posting  (patches by
    Richard Wagenblast):
       + modify reallocation limit of line-data when resizing screen so
         that  "lost"  text  will  be  restored  if the screen is first
         shrunk and then grown.
       + modify output to use double-buffering to reduce flicker.
  * modify  scroll-lock  action  to  handle on/off/toggle keywords like
    other actions. Previously the optional parameter was interpreted as
    an integer.
  * extend  DECSCUSR  to  provide a way to set the cursor to a vertical
    bar (patch by Paul Bolle).
  * add  -8,  -c,  -d  and -u options to 88colors2.pl and 256colors2.pl
    scripts.  No current terminal emulator recognizes C1 controls while
    handling  UTF-8  encodingâ\200\224see  notes in patch #119 and patch #109
    regarding  utf8controlsâ\200\224but  the -u and -8 options are useful for
    demonstrating this point.
  * improve  speed  when  changing color palettes using OSC controls by
    deferring repaint while followup controls might be additional color
    palette changes.
  * modify  SGR 38 and SGR 48 to accept RGB index, matching the closest
    entry in xterm's palette.
  * extend  SGR 38  and  SGR 48  to accept colon as parameter separator
    (request by Paul LeoNerd Evans).
  * modify fullscreen action to allow it to toggle the full-screen mode
    rather  than  only  set  or  unset  it  (prompted  by  Eeri  Kask's
    suggestion to support _NET_WM_TOGGLE). This implementation does not
    yet use _NET_WM_TOGGLE.
  * add      support      for      _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT     and
    _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ  EWMH  properties  (suggested  by Eeri
    Kask).
  * make  fullscreen  mode  work  with  the tek4014 window. This change
    makes  only the currently active window to be changed to fullscreen
    rather than changing both windows.
  * modify  TekClear function to discard pending output before clearing
    the tek4014 display (patch by Kevin Ryde).
  * fix  deleteIsDEL  feature,  broken in patch #280 changes (report by
    Mike Thornburg, forwarded by Jeremy Huddleston).
  * fix   a   special   case   of   wrapping   double-width  characters
    (report/test-case by Ken Winstein).
  * add E3 extended capability to xterm-basic to match ncurses 20120728
    patch.
  * fix     incorrect     transformation     of    row-parameter    for
    ClearCurBackground in patch #279 which caused incorrect painting in
    some scrolling scenarios (report by Chuck Silvers).
  * fix typo in manpage description of +maximized option (Paul Maier).
  * change  default  for  configure  option  --with-xpm,  turning it on
    unless requested otherwise.
  * add configure option --with-icon-name which can be used to override
    the default icon used in icon-themes.
  * extend  activeIcon  resource  to  provide default value which tells
    xterm  to  determine  the  window  manager's name and automatically
    enable  the  feature  for  fvwm  and  window  maker.  The  explicit
    true/false values can be used to override this behavior.
  * add  "mini" xterm icon, which scales better than the standard xterm
    icon, e.g., for the gnome/kde "panel" feature.
  * extend  iconName  resource  to  search  for icon named according to
    resource value and use that if found. If not found, use compiled-in
    pixmap. Both set the WM_ICON_NAME property which is used by various
    window managers, usually for window decoration.
  * updated  autoconf  patch,  adding  support for --datarootdir, which
    changes the default location of manpages.
  * further  improved  autoconf macros for configuring icons, from vile
    9.8h

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 17 15:13:06 UTC 2012 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #281 - 2012/06/26
  * remove "$(srcdir)/" from install-icon rule to fix builds when
    --srcdir configuration option is used.
  * fix for configure script's search for icon file when it is
    not found in the current directory, e.g., when building out
    of tree (patch by Thierry Reding).
  * undo the XK_Home / XK_End change from patch #280 which broke
    the non-VT220 keyboard for those keys (report by H Merijn
    Brand).
- Patch #280 - 2012/06/24
  * add configure check to work around warning from
    desktop-file-install for "Encoding", noting that it emits
    deprecation warnings without providing its version
    information.
  * add configure option --with-icon-theme to tell xterm whether
    to install into an icon theme, defaulting to "hicolor"
    (Redhat #755206, #799614 and #804279).
  * change --with-icondir to look for "icons" directory rather
    than "pixmaps" by default. Add new option --with-pixmapdir to
    allow these two uses to be installed concurrently.
  * modify configure options --with-app-defaults and
    --with-icondir to accept "auto" as value to look for existing
    directory from well-known locations.
  * add missing codes for secondary DA response which tell the
    type of terminal as in the primary DA response.
  * update primary DA response for VT420 to include user windows
    and horizontal scrolling.
  * add modifyKeyboard resource to support keypad-modifier
    changes per request by Thomas Wolff.
  * add XK_Home / XK_End to editing-keypad checks
  * add back-tab key kB to termcap entries to match the terminfo.
  * update terminfo to match corresponding entries in ncurses,
    e.g., add XT and adjust sgr string for xterm-bold entry.
  * add configure options to predefine the most commonly
    customized resources for terminal-settings, use those to
    substitute into the manpage the corresponding compiled-in
    values: altSendsEscape, backarrowKey, backarrowKeyIsErase,
    deleteIsDEL, metaSendsEscape (Redhat #819588).
  * change default emulation level to VT420 (discussion with
    Ailin Nemui).
  * improve logic for DECSCL; patch 279 partly enforced
    limitation of this to higher-level emulations. This patch
    finishes that change.
  * improve check for base of combining characters, preventing
    combination when cursor movement has intervened. Mosh's
    webpage gives two different examples of this, with other
    causes ascribed to the behavior.
  * modify IL/DL to set cursor to first column on row for better
    VT102/VT220 compatibility (prompted by code review of mosh).
  * separate state-table entries for DECSC/DECRC from the
    ANSI.SYS save/restore cursor, since the latter conflicts with
    DECSLRM when DECLRMM is enabled since patch #279
    (report/analysis by Ailin Nemui).
  * fixes to avoid using SIGCHLD handler of main program in
    printer's subprocess (report by Joe Julian).
  * correct restore-parameter for mouse-modes from patch #279
    changes.
  * add null-pointer checks to input-method caching added in
    patch #277 to fix a problem in the exposure code, when
    deselecting a window (report by Kriston Rehberg).
  * unset DESKTOP_STARTUP_ID environment variable to lessen
    confusion on the part of GTK applications which use the
    variable without checking it (report by John Little).

Thu Jan 19 12:31:33 UTC 2012 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #278 - 2012/01/18
  * correct initialization for eightBitMeta resource
    (FreeBSD #164101).
  * make special check for Darwin 9 (and lower) to not use
    posix_openpt (report by Christian Ebert).
  * minor fixes (adding ".ne" directives) to reduce the cases
    where groff's utility for generating images for tables dumps
    core. Most versions of groff (I've found 1.19.2 to be the
    most stable) dump core when attempting to report that there
    are too few lines on a page for a table to be shown.

- Patch #277 - 2012/01/07
  * remove special case for ISC pseudo-terminals which attempts
    to open the pty in two different ways.
  * move call to grantpt before asking utempter to add a record,
    to work with kFreeBSD which does not update the terminal's
    ownership until this point (Debian #652907).
  * document limitation of XIM interface in manpage
    (Debian #230787).
  * cleanup error reporting with new xtermWarning function.
  * add configure option --disable-selection-ops to make the new
    actions optional.
  * add four new actions for making the selection or data
    directly copied from the screen (prompted by discussion in
    Debian #637001, as well as report by Arjen van Tol):
    o exec-formatted
    o exec-selectable
    o insert-formatted
    o insert-selectable
  * add visualBellLine resource to allow visualBell to flash only
    the current line (prompted by patch by Gertjan Halkes).
  * add eightBitMeta resource to control the features which
    modify or interpret the eighth bit of a key when the meta
    modifier key is pressed (prompted by Debian #326200).
  * improve discussion of eightBitInput in the manpage (prompted
    by Debian #326200).
  * correct logic for alt-sends-escape action, overlooked when
    implementing altSendsEscape resource, which still used
    eightBitInput resource value.
  * add a workaround for XAllocColor(), which does not actually
    allocate "a read-only colormap entry corresponding to the
    closest RGB value supported by the hardware", but rather
    a rough approximation (Debian #650291).
  * undo parameter checks for RequestResize() added in patch #251
    and amended in patch #270, because zeros also are special
    cases (report by John S Urban).
  * modify some test-scripts to use /bin/echo rather than the
    shell's possibly-builtin echo, to work around broken
    configuration on Mac OS X, i.e., neither honoring the option
    nor flagging an error.
  * add SGR 1006, as a better technical solution than SGR 1015:
    o the responses will not be confused with line-deletion and
      scrolling controls.
    o the button encoding is a little simpler, since it does not
      add an unnecessary 32 because the integer parameter does
      not have to be represented as a printable character.
    o the control responses for pressing and releasing a mouse
      button differ, allowing an application to tell which button
      was released.
  * Besides these improvements, in discussion, it was noted that
    urxvt's implementation of 1005 is incorrect, relying upon
    a locale that provides UTF-8 encoding. In contrast, vttest
    demonstrates a correct decoding, independent of locale.
  * add support for urxvt SGR 1015 to address shortcoming of
    SGR 1005 with luit (patch by Egmont Koblinger).
  * add ISO and DEC controls useful for left/right scrolling.
  * add some changes for OpenBSD and MirBSD (adapted from patch
    by Thorsten Glaser):
    o disable search for non-Unix96 ptys.
    o fix a gcc warning in timestamp_filename
    o modify Imakefile to install xterm setgid to utmp.
  * add/use/prefer posix_openpt() for opening pseudo-terminal.
  * modify special errno handling case in ptydata.c from
    patch #158 to allow for the possibility that any platform may
    have special cases where "/dev/tty" is absent. For example,
    this can happen in a FreeBSD jail (patch by David Wolfskill).
  * add keyboard logic to map shift-tab into XK_ISO_Left_Tab,
    which is usually, not always, done by the X keyboard
    configuration.
  * portability fixes for some configure macros: CF_XOPEN_SOURCE

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 01:47:15 UTC 2011 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #276 - 2011/10/10
  * modify clipping limits for TrueType fonts to account for the
    scaleHeight resource setting, to work around another problem
    due to recent FreeType changes. In this case, the DejaVu Sans
    Mono set to pixelsize=13.5 is truncated because the font
    descent is reduced by FreeType to match an incorrect height
    metric (report by Adam Lee).
  * improve recovery when bitmap fonts are not installed, e.g.,
    so that switching font-sizes works for TrueType fonts.
  * modify lookup for XTERM_SHELL feature to allow relative
    pathnames.
  * modify abbreviation disambiguation check for command-line
    parameters to account for -geometry, whose parameter may
    begin with "+" or "-" (report by Scott Bertilson).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 14:20:26 UTC 2011 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #275 - 2011/09/11
  * add ash, zsh to known shells for resize.
  * modify resize to reuse the logic from xterm which determines
    the actual logon-user's shell if $SHELL is not set.
  * revert the unsetenv("SHELL") added in patch #272.
  * an unsetenv("SHELL") added in patch #272 to help ensure that
    luit would get the user's shell consistently did not work as
    expected for cases where multiple names are in the
    password-file for a given uid. That was because changes in
    patch #157 to handle this situation did not take into account
    that repeated calls to getpwnam and getpwuid return a pointer
    to the same static buffer. Fixed the older logic to work as
    intended, by ensuring that the passwd-data from each call is
    stored separately (report by Paul Keusemann).
  * adjust ifdef's for putenv and unsetenv in case only one of
    those is provided on a given platform.
  * correct comparison used in ExposeContains macro from patch
    #274 changes, to handle window-dragging (patch by Todd
    Eigenschink).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 15:52:47 UTC 2011 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #274 - 2011/09/05
  * portability fixes for cygwin: do not define SVR4, and work
    around nonstandard header location.
  * ifdef'd use of unsetenv from patch #273 changes to work with
    Solaris 9 (report by Waldemar Rachwal).
  * modify logic for XtAppPending to merge adjacent Expose and
    ConfigureNotify events which are redundant (report by Edward
    McGuire).
  * fix an unneeded warning message when -r option is given.
  * remove a few redundant entries from table used for helping
    abbreviation-checking of command-line options, makes -geom
    work again after patch #272 changes as an abbreviation of
    -geometry.
  * add scaleHeight resource and command-line option -sh as
    workaround for some font-configurations broken by changes in
    FreeType 2.4.6 (report by Miroslav Hodak).
  * portability fixes for some configure macros: CF_FUNC_TGETENT,
    CF_XOPEN_SOURCE, CF_X_ATHENA_LIBS.
  * add configure option --with-freetype-config to improve
    selection over the plethora of configuration options which
    freetype has so far provided.
  * build-fix for configure --enable-load-vt-fonts when
    --enable-widec is not specified.
  * build-fixes for suppressing various features, needed after
    changes in patches 270, 271 and 272 (report by Brian
    Lindholm)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 31 10:13:15 UTC 2011 - pcerny@suse.com

- Patch #273 - 2011/08/25
  * build-fix for out-of-tree "make docs" rule.
  * correct a typo in x_strdup, from patch #198 changes.
  * correct initialization for -e option, broken in patch #272
    changes (report by Gabriele Balducci).
  * build-fix for out-of-tree builds to address minstall script
    changes in patch #272 (patch by Thierry Reding).

- Patch #272 - 2011/08/24
  * document limitation of Gtk in connection with xterm's -into
    option, in the manpage (Ubuntu #806969).
  * improve -into by checking for and using the size of the window
    within which xterm is embedded, overriding other clues.
  * modify logic for localeFilter resource to allow that to
    include command-line options of luit.
  * improve -into by checking for invalid window-id, and allowing
    hexadecimal/decimal/octal values.
  * improve keepSelection, adding the case where the highlighting
    is cleared, overlooked in patch #230 (patch by Marco
    Peereboom).
  * improve command-line parsing to make abbreviate options work
    consistently across xterm-specific versus standard X toolkit
    options, and report cases where an abbreviated option happens
    to be ambiguous. In particular, -d now works as an
    abbreviation for -display.
  * fix regression in command-line parsing introduced in patch
    #271 changes for Debian #629358, (Debian #637910).
  * split-out new termcap/terminfo building block xterm+kbs for
    configurability.
  * modify terminfo file to reflect changes in ncurses for
    xterm-16color and xterm-256color.
  * modify minstall.sh, etc., to reflect the default default
    class, $TERM and decTerminalID values.
  * reword resize manpage to reflect the fact that $TERMCAP is not
    set on all systems (patch by Alan Coopersmith).
  * work around combined Xaw6/Xaw7 package in DragonFlyBSD which
    omits the usual symbolic link to the preferred library name.
  * further improve build-fix for termcap systems by checking for
    some which are only partial implementations, e.g., termcap
    2.08 in CentOS 5.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 12:11:45 UTC 2011 - pcerny@novell.com

- Patch #271 - 2011/07/14
  * omit permissions adjustments to pty on exit except for
    pre-Unix98 ptys, since modern implementations handle this
    (report by Sean C Farley).
  * modify logic for switching fonts between UTF-8 and non-UTF-8
  * encoding to not merge the derivable bold-, wide- and widebold
  * values from the VT100 fonts. Also suppress warning when not
  * using UTF-8 fonts if wide- and widebold-fonts cannot be
  * derived or otherwise loaded (report by Werner Scheinast).
  * modify menu-creation to suppress entries which will never be
    used in the current configuration, rather than simply disabling
    them.
  * add resource printModeImmediate and menu item to allow print
    of screen plus saved lines to a file.
  * add menu item to allow runtime enable/disable of the
    printFileOnXError feature.
  * append a timestamp to filename used in printFileOnXError
    feature, and restrict its permissions (request by Vincent
    Lefevre).
  * add a check when cancelling cursor-blinking, in case the
    cursor is blinked off. Fix so that the cursor is repainted
    without waiting for other events, e.g., keypress (report by
    Ailin Nemui).
  * add configure --with-app-class option, to simplify building
    "xterm-dev" packages with filenames that do not conflict with
    conventional "xterm" packages.
  * corrected logic flow for DECSCL, which prevented the updated
    operating level from being reported via DECRQSS (report by
    Ailin Nemui).
  * corrected default for brokenStringTerm resource to match
    manpage.
  * add vttests/dynamic.pl
  * add runtime check for locale not supported by X libraries, and
    fallback to XA_STRING in this case (request by Bryan
    Henderson).
  * fix a special case in configure script after no FreeType
    libraries are found. The script was proceeding to check for a
    usable configuration.
  * add xterm+tmux building block to terminfo (adapted from
    changes proposed by Ailin Nemui and Nicholas Marriott).
  * improve discussion of faceName resource in manpage (adapted
    from suggestions by Jens Schweikhardt).
  * correct mapping of shifted up/down cursor-keys in termcap
    function-keys mode, i.e., resource tcapFunctionKeys (patch by
    Gertjan Halkes).
  * update AIX case in CF_XOPEN_SOURCE configure macro to add
    release 7.x.
  * modify ifdef's in xterm_io.h for __hpux to force that to use
    the hacked SYSV support in that file. This fixes a problem
    with a non-blocking socket call (patch by Paul Lampert).
  * improve filtering of desktop category scanning, to exclude
    XFCE.
  * modify configure script to work with systems that have both
    ncurses (or other terminfo) as well as a real termcap library,
    e.g., Slackware (report by Alan Watts).
  * modify configure script to work around special case where
    user's environment adds compiler flags to the CC variable
    (prompted by report by Paul Lampert).
  * amend change for Debian #110226 so that "-h" or "-v" options
    cause an exit, rather than simply printing to stdout while the
    window is displayed (Debian #629358).
  * add response for DECRQSS which gives the setting for DECSCUSR.
  * modify AllocateTermColor() to handle XtDefaultForeground and
    XtDefaultBackground, which are not recognized by XParseColor.
    For example, this fixes the use of OSC 112 when no explicit
    cursor color was set (report by Ailin Nemui).
  * handle special-case of KeyPress translated to popup-menu
    action (Ubuntu #756273).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 12 13:00:23 UTC 2011 - pcerny@novell.com

- Patch #270 - 2011/04/26
  * build-fix, e.g., for using imake on platforms which use the
    termcap library.
  * modify utf8 resource to accept a name.
  * mention default for fontWarnings in manpage (report by Werner
    Scheinast).
  * split "UTF-8" menu entry into "UTF-8 Encoding" and "UTF-8
    Fonts".
  * gray-out font-menu entries when a font fails to load, e.g., a
    bitmap font is not installed.
  * improve behavior when there is no app-defaults file:
    o set the toolBar resource to false
    o gray-out the font menu entries where no resource is found.
  * add configure option --with-desktop-category to allow
    customization of the ".desktop" files.
  * build-fix for the install-desktop makefile-rule, when the
    source/build directories differ (patch by Loïc Minier).
  * add menu entry and corresponding resource which can be used to
    suppress all bold-fonts (discussion with Jan Engelhardt).
  * make internal line-size value consistent with allocated sizes
    of character and related arrays to ensure that bulk copying of
    line data, e.g., in scrolling, accounts for the padding used
    for pointer alignment (adapted from patch by Rajesh
    Mandalemula, also reported by Ali Bahar).
  * widen ifdef for screen-resizing logic from patch #176 changes
    to send SIGWINCH to process group to include any system
    supporting ioctl(*,TIOCGPGRP,*) (prompted by linux-specific
    patch in OpenSUSE rpm package).
  * add printModeOnXError and printFileOnXError resources, which
    allow the user to specify that xterm will write the contents
    of its screen to a file if it is exiting due to an X error
    (Debian #280457).
  * restore logic that made reverse-video apply to the scrollbar's
    foreground/background, broken in patch #158 (report by Bryan
    Ischo).
  * amend some of the window operations parameter-checks added in
    patch #251 for the push/pop title feature, to allow the
    parameters used for window resizing to be -1's, which makes
    the corresponding values ignored rather than using the
    window's maximum width/height (report by Noah Friedman).
  * correct order of initialization for translations vs fullscreen
    resources to enable a special case which omits the Alt-Enter
    translation when fullscreen is disabled (Debian #612978).
  * update config.guess, config.sub

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 11:31:32 UTC 2011 - pcerny@novell.com

- Patch #269 - 2011/02/19
  * build-fixes for imake (report by Heiko Berges).
  * modify autoconf macro CF_PKG_CONFIG to work with cross-compile
    environments (patch by Thierry Reding).
  * modify MapToColorMode() to favor bold over underline, matching
    the precedence used before patch #252 (report/analysis by
    Nicolas George).
  * add omitTranslation resource, which can be used to suppress
    the default translations for these features:
    o fullscreen
    o scroll-lock
    o shift-fonts
    o wheel-mouse
  * make the fullscreen feature configurable (Debian #612978)
    o add it to the configurable list disallowedWindowOps.
    o add command-line option -fullscreen to allow the feature to
      be enabled at startup.
    o add resource fullscreen to control whether the feature is
      active or may be enabled.
  * modify probe_netwm_fullscreen_capability for 64-bit machines.
    Contrary to XGetWindowProperty manpage, that function returns
    32-bit data packed as long's.
  * eliminate copy of name resource, which was otherwise used only
    to give the terminal-description name for the tcap-query
    feature. Use the actual $TERM value instead, as derived from
    termName resource, etc.
  * eliminate an old inconsistency with error messages, some used
    the -name option, while others used argv[0]. The latter is now
    used consistently.
  * improve configure check for rpath-hack, to improve builds on
    systems where gcc will not search /usr/local/lib, etc.
  * build-fix for Xaw3d configuration (report by H Merijn Brand).
  * update config.guess, config.sub

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 16 18:30:45 UTC 2011 - pcerny@novell.com

- Patch #268 - 2011/02/10
  * fix an inconsistency of the "Enable Reverse Video" checkbox in the VT
    Options menu. This also removes a special case added in patch #217 which
    limited the effect of the reverseVideo resource (Debian #603808).
  * amend decoding of misformed UTF-8 sequences to avoid absorbing valid
    characters as documented in Unicode 6.0 section 3.9 (report by Keith
    Winstein).
  * do not set urgency hint when window already has focus (patch by Dimitrios
    Christidis).
  * amend extended mouse-coordinate mode from patch #262 changes to include the
    Cb button-code, which also may be greater than 127 (report by Ailin Nemui).
  * ensure that underline-cursor is visible when an application happens to set
    the background color (report by Christian Weisgerber).
  * add feature for full-screen toggling using either Alt-Enter or a menu
    selection (integrated patch by Dave Simmons).
  * add missing logic to handle reallocation of FIFO index for the "UTF-8" menu
    entry (report by David Holland, NetBSD #44344).
  * add makefile rules docs-ctlseqs, docs-xterm, etc.
  * correct typo in description of DECRPM in control sequences document (report
    by Ailin Nemui).

- Patch #267 - 2010/11/20
  * minor formatting changes to ctlseqs.ms to simplify a script which extracts
    the feature information. See the results in Comparing versions, by counting
    controls in the xterm FAQ.
  * add docs-clean makefile rule.
  * add copy-selection action (request by Timo Juhani Lindfors, Debian #588785).
  * trim leading/trailing blanks from string used for "Selection" font-menu
    data.
  * trim leading/trailing blanks from color resource values.
  * configure script improvements:
    o add workaround for removal of X11 dependency from Xt's package file
      (report by Robert Hooker).
    o add workaround for removal of fontconfig dependency from Xft's package
      file (report by Jeremy Huddleston).
    o add workaround for removal of Xmu dependency from Xaw's package file
      (report by Jeremy Huddleston).
    o improve workaround in CF_X_TOOLKIT macro, checking for other possible
      packages where Xt's dependencies may be given.
    o prefer ${name:=value} to ${name-value}, since recent bash changes break
      legacy support for that feature.

- Patch #266 - 2010/10/24
  * add rpm and dpkg scripts, for testing.
  * more fixes for Debian #600707 (report by Cyril Brulebois).

- Patch #265 - 2010/10/22
  * fix a regression in fontname logic from patch #263 changes (Debian #600707,
    reported by Vincent Lefevre).
  * revert modification of any-event/any-button protocol from patch #263
    changes. It interferes with selection using a shifted mouse button (reports
    by Neil Bird, Bram Moolenaar).

- Patch #264 - 2010/10/14
  * replace a null-pointer check with check for empty string in
    xtermOpenFont, to eliminate a warning message from patch #263 changes.
  * build-fix for patch #263 when toolbar is not configured (patch by
    Chris Clayton) (reports by Robby Workman, David Wood).

- Patch #263 - 2010/10/13
  * corrected initialization of "misc" resource values, to ensure that
    xterm has allocated a copy of strings which may not have been malloc'd
    by the X library (Debian #600129).
  * modify handling of any-event/any-button mouse protocol; it now is
    active with any combination of key-modifiers.
  * add debugging feature showWrapMarks, which marks lines which xterm
    knows are wrapped, showing where a double-click will select past the
    end of a line.
  * build-fix to address change in include-guards for Xlib.h in ongoing
    Xorg edits (patch by Jeremy Huddleston).
  * improve pointerMode by continuing to watch for motion events after
    mouse tracking is disabled if the pointer is hidden (Debian #594856).
  * further extend initialization for active-icon font to check if the
    font was not loaded succesfully, to retry with font1, or as even
    (if TrueType fonts are used) to use a TrueType font. The retries
    are to help with cases as in patch #241 where the bitmap fonts are
    not available.
  * fix special case of active-icon used when TrueType font is specified
    for the xterm window, from patch #261 change. In that case, the
    default font's size was used for layout of the active icon's window
    (Debian #591265).

- Patch #262 - 2010/8/30
  * fix a case where changing the cursor color via escape sequences did
    not immediately update the screen (report by Andreas Wagner).
  * implement ANSI and DEC request-mode control sequences. The latter
    includes the xterm-specific private modes such as the mouse mode. The
    feature is ifdef'd with the rectangle operations since its decoding
    overlaps that feature.
  * correct typo in ctlseqs.ms for response of OSC 21 (patch by Kevin Schoedel).
  * improve discussion of mouse tracking in ctlseqs.ms
  * increase an array limit used in reporting mouse events (report by Ryan Johnson).
  * add extended mouse-coordinates mode, allowing up to 2015x2015 windows,
    using UTF-8 encoding (patch by Ryan Johnson).
  * modify manpage hyphens to conform with Debian.

- Patch #261 - 2010/6/28
  * fix regression in renderFont logic, from patch #260 changes (report
    by Joseph Quinsey).

- Patch #260 - 2010/6/20
  * modify plink.sh to work around problem linking to recent PCRE libraries.
  * extend renderFont resource to allow deferred switch to TrueType
    fonts without affecting existing resource settings (Debian #585620).
  * modify configure macro CF_X_TOOLKIT to work around omission of ICE
    library from ".pc" file (report by Miroslav Lichvar).
  * change configure script default for --enable-broken-st i.e., the
    brokenStringTerm feature) to normally enable it. If the corresponding
    resource is enabled, this feature eliminates an apparent freeze of
    xterm when sending mis-encoded data to the screen (Debian #584801).
  * document in manpage some actions which were overlooked:
    o readline-button
    o scroll-lock
    o set-8-bit-control
  * undo a change to limit-check in ScrnRefresh in patch #257, which
    broke fastScroll feature (Debian #584841).
  * modify handling of brokenLinuxOSC and brokenStringTerm to also sound
    the bell.
  * add control/D and control/Q to controls which will cause early exit
    from control string per brokenStringTerm resource.
  * improve documentation of brokenStringTerm resource in manpage.

- Patch #259 - 2010/6/5
  * modify configure check for luit to include new aliases for the program
    (xterm-filter and bluit).
  * add workaround in xtermClearLEDs() to account for Xkb's override,
    making vttest's LED demo reset the scroll lock.
  * filter out client-message events when deciding whether to hide cursor,
    e.g., when using SCIM (patch/report by anonymous user).
  * improve description of -bd option in manpage (report by Guy Daniel Clotilde).
  * modify configure checks for PCRE and other libraries to use pkg-config, if available.
  * amend change from patch #252, to take veryColorColors resource into
    account when checking colorBDMode resource for TrueType fonts (report
    by anonymous user).
  * add vttests/query-fonts.pl script for demonstrating the OSC 50 font query.
  * improve manpage discussion of Scroll Lock feature.
  * improve configure macros CF_GCC_VERSION and CF_GCC_WARNINGS.
  * fix warnings for "clang --analyze".
  * change default for allowScrollLock resource to false, noting that
    the supposedly unused key has been useful for various rebindings
    (Debian #580946).

- Patch #258 - 2010/5/1
  * add pointer-checks in ScrnRefresh to fix a case in rapid scrolling
    where an empty record is fetched from the scrollback FIFO.

- Patch #257 - 2010/4/22
  * correct ctlseqs.ms description of OSC 17 and OSC 19 (patch by Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * corrected logic for menuLocale resource; the setlocale function
    returns the original locale only when querying.
  * improve filtering of translations resource, narrowing the scope of
    the alwaysUseMods to address only the translations that would cause
    a key to be sent to the host (report by Andrew Gaylard).
  * change default value of menuLocale resource to "C", to work around
    longstanding Xorg bug.
  * modify handling of scrollKey feature to ignore XON/XOFF keys.
  * implement scroll-lock feature.
  * revise memory allocation in UTF8toLatin1() to fix an out-of-bounds
    index (Mandriva #54531).
  * compute value for first wide-character rather than assuming it is
    256, fixes problem with -cjk_width introduced in patches 242 and 249
    (report by Thomas Wolff).
  * improve configure script:
    o corrected check for _XOPEN_SOURCE for OpenSolaris.
    o when possible, add rpath option for libraries in unusual places
    o add configure option --disable-rpath-hack to control whether the rpath option can be added.
  * modify AllocateTermColor() to separate initialization from control
    sequences, fixing problem from patch #254 changes where enabling
    allowSendEvents resource prevents setting cursor color on command-line
    (Debian #572928).
  * amend logic from patch #185 to not reallocate cell-array if processing
    ESC % G to switch from UTF-8 if already in ISO-8859-1 character set
    (report by Michael Koehne).
  * fix to avoid calling XmuInternStrings() with zero count (report by Johan Bockgård).
  * fix build when --disable-ansi-color configure option is used.
  * fix build when neither OPT_TCAP_QUERY or OPT_TCAP_FKEYS is defined
    (patch by Matthieu Herrb)

- Patch #256 - 2010/3/6
  * add TerminalEmulator to desktop category files.
  * modify sinstall.sh to ignore the "." appended to permissions by selinux.
  * change app-defaults organization, installing UXTerm-color and
    KOI8XTerm-color for consistent behavior regarding customization: color
    (prompted by discussion in Ubuntu #421261).
  * fix typo in minstall.sh from patch #255 changes, and add case for
    /var/run needed for full path of utmp (report by Julien Cristau).
  * minor fix to xterm manpage, remove a comment stating that margin bell
    can be changed via the VT Options menu. That was replaced in patch #225
  * add a "docs" rule to makefile.
  * fix initialization of Atom used for XkbBell feature from patch 243
    changes. Unlike the other calls to XInternAtom(), in this case the
    flag telling X to create the Atom was unset (patch by Chris Adams).

Sat Feb 13 11:15:30 CET 2010 - jslaby@suse.de

- Patch #255 - 2010/1/21
    * rename install.sh to install-sh in case suffix-rules might interfere.
    * extend range for convertToUTF8 function to full 31-bits, to use with
      printing, etc.
    * improve manpage by checking for actual locations of utmp/wtmp files
      (Debian #562640).
    * modify configure macro CF_XOPEN_SOURCE to remove -D's before adding the
      same name rather than relying on -U's, to reduce redefinition warnings
      for some platforms that have conflicting definitions in headers.
    * correct logic used to switch to alternate screen using FIFO-lines
      configuration (Debian #565772).
    * update config.guess, config.sub

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 17:13:30 CET 2010 - meissner@suse.de

- Patch #254 - 2010/1/6
    * add a configure-check to eliminate install-ti rule from Makefile
      when the system has no tic (terminfo compiler) program. This lets
      one use the install-full rule more consistently.
    * amend change to WriteText() function in patch #252 to take into
      account the colorAttrMode resource (report by Krzysztof Kotlenga).
    * document titleModes resource in manpage, added in patch #252.
    * modify tcap-query table entries for shifted up/down cursor keys
      to match ncurses convention.
    * improve lookup of termcap-query data, allowing for duplicate
      keycodes versus missing entries.
    * add control sequence which can be used to modify the terminal data
      used for the termcap-keyboard.
    * improve portability of tcap-query feature, using terminfo functions
      in preference to termcap on systems having terminfo.
    * improve font-setting/querying control (OSC 50):
          o when TrueType font is selected, the TrueType faceName will
            be set, rather than the bitmap font.
          o when TrueType font is selected, querying returns the name
            of the TrueType font.
          o querying a font recognizes the relative-font convention that
            setting a font could use.
    * add menu-entry for allowColorOps.
    * add new resources for fine-tuning menu entries: allowColorOps,
      disallowedColorOps, disallowedFontOps and disallowedTcapOps.
    * correct logic for disabling the "TrueType Fonts" menu item; it
      was not ensuring that the faceName resource value was non-empty.
    * implement VT520-style controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting
      the margin- and warning-bell volume.
    * fix a minor error from patch #243 which made the zIconBeep feature
      use a minor-error tone rather than an informational tone.
    * add a null-pointer check for the case where renderFont resource is
      true, but faceName resource is unset, used in logic to strip "xft:"
      prefix from patch #251 changes (patch by Michael Riepe).
    * add special case to configure CF_XOPEN_SOURCE macro to use
      extensions on Darwin (patch by Dennis Preiser).
    * improve configure checks for regular expressions header and library
    * update config.guess, config.sub

- Patch #253 - 2009/12/10
    * add a null-pointer check in getPrinterFlags() per changes in patch #252.
    * add a null-pointer check, needed in UTF-8 mode for Xft fonts after
      changes in patch #252 (patch by Alan Coopersmith).
    * correct size when clearing struct for tek4014 (patch by Jochen Voss).
    * parenthesize expression in MoreRows macro, fixing a limit check
      added in patch #251 (Debian #560039).

- Patch #252 - 2009/12/7
    * modify title-querying logic to support retrieval of titles encoded using UTF-8.
    * add new "title-modes" control sequence for controlling whether
      window/icon titles can be set or queried using UTF-8, optionally
      encoded in a hexadecimal string.
    * use mkdir -p rather than mkdirs.sh (prompted by discussion of mawk
      by Aleksey Cheusov).
    * add appropriate copyright/license notices to the bulk of files
      lacking same, and modify to use identical terms in others which used
      different wording. The main exceptions are the files contributed
      by Markus Kuhn, who appears to prefer public domain distribution,
      noting that I have modified/improved several of these without
      changing the terms of distribution (request by Jari Aalto).
    * add control sequences for resetting the "dynamic" colors to their
      default values.
    * add control sequences for resetting the "special" colors to their
      default values.
    * add control sequences for setting the "special" colors such as
      colorBD (bold).
    * add overlooked case for setting highlight foreground color with
      the dynamic-colors control.
    * add OSC 104, for resetting ANSI/16/88/256 colors to default.
    * reset ANSI/16/88/256 colors to default in soft/hard reset functions.
    * strip "xft:" prefix from faceName and faceNameDoublesize resource values,
    * add DECSCUSR (discussion with Andy Koppe).
    * add check/warning on failure to load font, to see if the name looks
      like an Xft pattern rather than XLFD. This can happen if someone
      happens to modify their X resource settings for programs that read
      data from xterm's namespace.
    * modify handling of print and print-everything actions to allow
      the various printer flags to be overridden by supplying parameters.
    * add resource printerNewLine (request by Ovidiu Gheorghioiu).
    * minor cleanup, finish using TScreenOf() and TekScreenOf() macros introduced in patch #224.
    * improve checks in ShowCursor/HideCursor to get the background color,
      particularly when highlightReverse resource is used (reports by
      Jan Engelhardt, Christian Weisgerber).
    * correct checkVeryBoldAttr to omit comparison of foreground color
      to special color values used for color<XX> resources (report by
      Jan Engelhardt).
    * make colorBDMode and colorULMode resources work with TrueType
      configuration (report by Jan Engelhardt).

- Patch #251 - 2009/11/11
    * add window-ops controls to push/pop icon and/or window labels on a stack.
    * minor fixes to align termcap file with terminfo.
    * add resource disallowedWindowOps, to allow fine-tuning of features
      to suppress with the allowWindowOps resource (prompted by discussion
      with Bram Moolenaar).
    * add makefile rules for resize-manpage to pdf, etc.
    * further improve limit-checks in select/paste (Mandriva #54531).

- Patch #250 - 2009/10/13
    * add check and error-message for fonts that have no printable values
      in the ISO-8859-1 range (Debian #542434).
    * some compiler-warning cleanup, in particular workaround for
      defective implementation of gcc's attribute warn_unused_result
      (report by Bram Moolenaar).
    * improve estimate of single-column width for packed TrueType fonts
      by ignoring extents for codes 127 and 159.
    * improve line-drawing for TrueType fonts which happen to have defined
      glyphs which are not line-drawing in 0..31 by assuming they're not,
      and just checking the existence of the Unicode codepoints. This
      makes it more likely that the user can override a misconfigured
      font using the "Line-Drawing Characters" menu entry.
    * limit minimum cell-width for packed font to maximum-advance reported
      by Xft. Some fonts are wider than that, even in the Latin-1 range
      (Debian #550497).
    * add list of direct-contributors in "THANKS" file.
    * stylistic changes to this file to help scripted extraction of list
      of contributors.
    * correct off-by-one in okPosition fix from patch #249 limit-checks
      which prevented double-click selection on the bottom line of the
      screen (reports by Rajeev V. Pillai, Debian #550368).
    * add -q option to vttest/256colors2.pl and vttest/88colors2.pl to
      demonstrate bulk initialization of color palette.
    * improve the workaround from patch #188 by enabling resources for
      the 88-color model.
    * document in xterm manpage the limited availability of resources
      color16 to color255 as noted in patch #188 (Ubuntu #438850).

- Patch #249 - 2009/10/1
    * change default for allowWindowOps resource to false.
    * add limit-checks for result of visual_width() function, needed
      from patch #242 and exposed by #244 changes (Debian #548321).
    * improve limit-checks in select/paste.
    * fix a remaining bug from patch #230 changes for displaying
      multi-column characters in a proportional font (report by Chris
      Jones).
    * add new resource forcePackedFont and menu entry "Packed Font" to
      control whether to use the font's minimum (default) or maximum width
      when those differ. The workaround which xterm uses to accommodate
      proportional fonts is not necessary with certain fonts such as
      unifont which happen to store a mixture of multicolumn glyphs
      (report by Chris Jones).
    * fix an (old) bug which did not restart the timer for blinking
      text if the only blinking text was temporarily scrolled out of view,
      e.g., using the scrollbar.
    * fix an (old) flaw in the delete-line operation where the text
      which is scrolled into view while the display is scrolled up was
      not repainted.
    * improve delete-line and insert-line operations, retaining selection
      when the selection does not intersect the deleted/inserted lines.
    * fix an (old) off-by-one error when an application cleared above
      the cursor position while the display was scrolled up, that would
      leave an extra line of text uncleared.
    * fix a similar problem where the double-size attribute would not
      be reset when clearing the screen while the display was scrolled up.
    * fix an indexing error which would occur if an application cleared
      a line while the display was scrolled up and was also in UTF-8 mode
      (Redhat #524503). The error was from patch #228 but more visible
      after changes from patch #244.

- Patch #248 - 2009/9/11
    * fix an overlooked adjustment for selecting double-width characters
      in the narrow-character configuration.
    * eliminate uses of XTERM_CELL and XTERM_CELLC where an appropriate
      LineData pointer is available.
    * correct expression in okScrnRow macro, making selections give the
      length of lines below the visible screen (report by Stuart Henderson).
    * correct logic used to improve performance of missing-glyph check,
      which did not handle line-drawing characters (Debian #545220).

- Patch #247 - 2009/8/30
    * add ifdef's and check for openpty() on DragonFly (patch by Alex
      Hornung).
    * correct calculation for size of line's data block, which was
      sometimes off-by-one when configured using --enable-16bit-chars
      (report by H Merijn Brand).
    * fix indexing error in print-everything feature from patch #246
      (patch by Ovidiu Gheorghioiu).

- Patch #246 - 2009/8/16
    * remove obsolete logic for saving/restoring wrapping flags, which did
      not work on 64-bit platform. Wrapping flags (stored in the
      line-index) are now copied with line-data (Debian #541160).
    * modify comments in app-defaults files to avoid problem with C
      preprocessor used by xrdb (Debian #541603).
    * restore special case in makeColorPair, needed for colorBDMode
      resource (Debian #541089).
    * correct SetLineFlags() macro, broken in patch #244 when recoding
      to avoid gcc-specific bitfields (Debian #541236).
    * modify initialization of screen buffers to ensure that pointers
      align to int-boundaries. This fixes a problem introduced in patch
      #244 where the color- and character-arrays (stored after the
      video-attributes in each row) might be misaligned (report by Rajeev
      V Pillai).
    * add limit-check in ScrnRefresh for handling saved-lines from the
      circular buffer which are repainted on a screen whose width has
      increased. To improve performance, circular buffer entries are
      not resized (report by Rajeev V Pillai).
    * correct type for CellColor (a late change in patch #244 to avoid
      gcc-specifc enums made that unsigned rather than unsigned short,
      for the 256-color option).
    * fix typo in configure option --enable-16bit-chars (report by Rajeev
      V. Pillai).

- Patch #245 - 2009/8/12
    * correct a special case in saving FIFO-lines from patch #244. If
      the screen was shrunk, xterm used the wrong amount for copying to
      FIFO-lines, and then used this amount to adjust the current row
      on the screen. That was both a visible defect (Debian #541109)
      as well as a potential addressing error (Debian #541132, #541160,
      and #541236).
    * add clarification in xterm manual about the various allowXXXOps
      resources, which are disabled when the allowSendEvents resource
      is active (patch by Julien Cristau, Debian #531597).

- Patch #244 - 2009/8/9
    * refactored storage of saved-lines, providing a configure
      option to manage them as a FIFO (actually a circular buffer),
      improving performance. Added configure option --enable-fifo-lines
      to enable/disable the new feature (it is enabled by default).
    * added fastScroll resource, to amuse people who measure terminal
      emulator performance by cat'ing large files to the screen.
    * modify check in readPtyData from return values to provide exit
      on zero-bytes read from pty for FreeBSD, or eliminate high-CPU
      in "xterm-hold" processing (discussion with Ulrich Spoerlein,
      FreeBSD ports/136686). The check was originally modified to combine
      negative/zero values in XFree86-3.1.2E, 1996/05/06.
    * add configure option --enable-16bit-chars to provide wide-characters
      with 1account whether they are double-width (report by Guilbert
      Stabilo on comp.unix.shell).
    * add capability for keypad-center (kb2/KA2) to termcap entry
      for xterm-new, as well as xterm-8bit, xterm-sun and xterm-vt220
      (FreeBSD conf/136336).
    * change default for keepSelection resource to true (prompted by
      discussion with David Muir Sharnoff).
    * remove a limit-check in ptydata.c, allowing Unicode values past
      64k to be displayed using TrueType fonts (Debian #458432).
    * remove a vt52-specific ifdef to allow mapping F1-F4 to PF1-PF4
      when vt52 support is not compiled (report by Olaf 'Rhialto' Seibert).
    * save/restore line-wrapping flags when converting from ISO-8859-1
      encoding to UTF-8 encoding, as well as when resizing screen.
    * remove extra adjustment of position in fix for Debian #418324.
    * modify default check for mkWidth resource to check for line-drawing
      characters, which are categorized as double-width in Solaris 10
      (report by Sebastian Kayser).
    * add "print-everything" action (patch by Ovidiu Gheorghioiu).
    * start refactoring scrollback data using new getLineData() function.
    * demote recent change to Debian #252873 fix to experimental,
      ifdef'd out as EXP_BOGUS_FG (Debian #522141).
    * work around groff mapping of ASCII quotes using macros (requested
      by Reuben Thomas based on Colin Watson advice, fixes Debian #378700).
    * correct symbol used for default of allowWindowOps which was
      DEF_ALLOW_FONT rather than DEF_ALLOW_WINDOW (report by Matthieu
      Herrb).
    * amend fix for tek4014 from patch #243 to make it only apply to
    the Tek Options menu.

Patch #243 - 2009/3/28

    * revert change to default for allowTcapOps (request by Bram Moolenaar).
    * reallocate result returned by xtermEnvLocale() to avoid reference
      to freed memory after handling menuLocale resource.
    * fix an old (X11R5) bug in tek4014 for switching fontsizes.
    * add resource defaultString to make configurable the use of "#"
      when pastes of UTF-8 text fail due to limitations in the current
      locale settings.
    * make the set of selection target Atom's configurable by two new
      resources eightBitSelectTypes and utf8SelectTypes, e.g., to use the
      TEXT Atom in preference to UTF8_STRING (discussion with Stanislav
      Sedov regarding koi8rxterm and the FreeBSD port).
    * modify handling of TARGETS Atom by making it return exactly the
      set of targets as those which xterm is currently providing.
    * set MANPAGER and PAGER explicitly to /bin/cat in minstall.sh
      to work around /etc/man.conf's with those variables already set
      (report by Марьясин Семён).
    * improve error-checking of tcap-query parser.
    * add check for keyboard tcap), which ensures that terminal
      descriptions containing the same string for shifted/unshifted keys
      will be seen by tcap-query as only the unshifted key. (This would
      only happen with an incorrect terminal description).
    * fix conversion for input event-state to modifier-parameter which
      made tcap-query feature not work with tcapFunctionKeys (keyboard
      type tcap).
    * add "DEF_ALLOW_XXX" definitions to main.h to allow overriding the
      default compiled-in values for "allowxxx" resources.
    * remove check on bell-percentage added in patch #242, which
      disallowed zero/negative values (Redhat Bugzilla #487829).

- refresh patches to avoid fuzz

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 16 11:48:01 CET 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- updated to release xterm-242
  * fix  configure  check for XkbBell and provide appropriate parameter
    for it.
  * fix  a  caching problem with double-size fonts versus reverse video
    that could cause core dump.
  * repair double-size fonts from workaround used in [246]patch #240.
  * add new section to the VT Fonts menu which allows enabling or
    disabling the font, termcap (tcap-query), title and window operations.
  * add  fontWarnings  resource, to control whether to show warnings on
    failure to load a font.
  * improve warnings for unloadable fonts introduced in [247]patch #240
    by limiting those to the cases where a font would be specified
    directly by a resource setting rather than a derived fontname.
  * further amend fix for Debian #252873 from [248]patch #197 to treat
    a blank cell which does not have both foreground and background
    colored as a non-colored cell. This improves a special case where
    the cursor is on a blank cell which had foreground color scrolled
    in (report by Miroslav Lichvar).
    Also add the same logic when hiding cursor, so the outline matches
    the in-focus cursor.
  * modify internals to reduce places PAIRED_CHARS() is used, making
    WriteText() and ScrnWriteText() accept IChar array, as well as
    providing a wrapper for drawXtermText().
  * change default XIM font from "*" to "fixed" to improve startup time
    in zh_CN.UTF-8 locale (Mike Fabian, bnc#464930).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  3 17:48:09 CET 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- updated to release xterm-241
  * improve checks for missing bitmap fonts, fallback to "fixed" as
    needed to work around broken font-packages (report by Jacek Luczak).
  * fix breakage from patch #240 changes for xtermAddInput() (patches
    by Jeff Chua, Julien Cristau).

- updated to release xterm-240

  * use plink.sh for linking xterm (suggested by Larry Doolittle).
  * add resource descriptions for input method to xterm manpage.
  * update configure script; consistently append to $CFLAGS rather
    than prepend.
  * add install-scripts rule to makefile, to allow roi8xterm and uxterm
    scripts to be altered independently of install-bin
  * add -maximized command-line option and corresponding resource
    (prompted by alt.os.linux newsgroup comment).
  * modify translations of scrollbar widget using xtermAddInput() (see
    patch #181) to accept the actions that the vt100 widget accepts, such as
    shift-insert to perform a paste operation (request by Martin Zwickel).
  * change default for allowTcapsOps resource to false, since it causes
    unexpected behavior for vim users with AltGr.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 29 15:55:23 CET 2009 - mfabian@suse.de

- bnc#464930: change the default for the ximFont resource from "*"
  to "fixed", this still works fine with the XIM servers "scim"
  and "kinput2" and speeds up the startup time of xterm
  dramatically in zh_CN.UTF-8 and zh_HK.UTF-8 locales.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 13 14:39:25 CET 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- update to release xterm-239
  * correct  a  cast  in  input.c,  which  broke translation of numeric
    keypad  codes to pageup, pagedown, etc., on 64-bit platform (Debian
    #511138, report by Larry Doolittle).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  5 15:03:09 CET 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- update to release xterm-238, Linux relevant changes:

- Various security fixes for CVE-2008-2383 (ANSI command injection)

- xterm-disallow-window-and-fonts-ops.patch: add allowWindowOps and
  allowFontOps as "false" for default. bnc#462917

- Patch #238 - 2008/12/30
  # reset the screen wrapping-flag at the end of ClearRight to fix an
    occasional case where the last character of a scrolled and wrapped
    line would be cleared (patch by Joe Peterson).
  # modify to use POSIX coding for comparing resource settings such as
    locale, to work with locales such as Turkish (report by M Vefa
    Bicakci).
  # turn on configure paste64 feature by default (request by Jean-Philippe
    Bernardy). It is runtime enabled/disabled with allowWindowOps.
  # turn on configure tcap-query feature by default, add resource
    allowTcapOps to make this runtime enabled/disabled.
  # make OSC 3 (change X property, from patch #110) subject to
    allowWindowOps resource.
  # make VT220 DSR responses inactive in VT100-mode.
  # make DECUDK feature inactive in VT100-mode.
  # respond to incorrectly formatted DECRQSS with a cancel.
  # add allowFontOps resource to allow the fontsize-switching and font
    query/set control sequences to be enabled/disabled (prompted by Debian
    #510030).
  # some code cleanup based on gcc 4.x -Wconversion warnings in button.c
    and charproc.c
  # modify tcap-query feature to not return data for shifted cursor-keys
    when the keyboard type is set to vt220, since returning the same
    string for shifted/unshifted keys may confuse some applications
    (GenToo #212546).

- Patch #237 - 2008/09/14
  # improve usability of TrueType fonts by making the font-size switching
    for shifted keypad plus/minus use the faceSize resources to determine
    the order of fonts (when TrueType fonts are used) rather than the
    bitmap fonts, since their sizes may not be in the same order (report
    by H Merijn Brand)
  # remove an optimization of ConfigureNotify events from patch #236
    which seems to interfere with passing SIGWINCH to applications
    (GenToo #233836).
  # modify handling of altSendsEscape to reset the eightBitInput mode,
    like metaSendsEscape (patch by Ted Phelps).
  # add feature to show the text-cursor as an underline rather than a box,
    plus command-line options -uc and +uc and resource cursorUnderLine to
    control the feature (patch by Paul Lampert).
  # update config.guess, config.sub


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 28 11:16:08 CEST 2008 - sndirsch@suse.de

  * correct memory reallocation when handling a paste of UTF-8
    text from [240]patch #225 changes (report/patch by Max
    Mikhanosha).
  * correct allocation of temporary buffer in xtermFindShell in
    case the user's $PATH contains no ":" (report/analysis
    by Victor Stinner, Freedesktop.Org Bugzilla #16790).
  * modify CF_XOPEN_SOURCE to add case for DragonFly BSD, to fix
    new compile problem exposed by fix for fd_mask (patch by
    Hasso Tepper).
  * add  configure-check  for  ncurses  use_extended_names,
    (report by Martin Mokrejs).
  * correct  computation  for  toolbar  height; layout manager
    already takes into account borderWidth resource.
  * implement  VT320-style  SCS (select character set) for ISO
    Latin-1 supplemental.
  * fixes  for  vt100-style  character  sets  in  UTF-8  mode
    (Ubuntu #230919).
  * fix  to  make  luit  work with xterm's -ls option
    (report/patch by Marius Tolzmann).
  * update config.guess, config.sub

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    settings:
       + altSendsEscape (private mode 1039)
       + keepSelection (private mode 1040)
       + selectToClipboard (private mode 1041)
       + bellIsUrgent (private mode 1042)
       + popOnBell (private mode 1043)
  * add resource formatOtherKeys to provide an alternate escape
    sequence format for the modifyOtherKeys resource (request by
    Paul LeoNerd Evans).
  * adjust saved-cursor position if the window is resized while
    displaying the alternate screen (Novell #196880, Debian
    #383384).
  * improve pointer-checks to fix a bug exposed by resizing during
    initialization under StumpWM window manager (Fedora  Bugzilla
    #437928).
  * modify unselectwindow() to ensure that the mouse pointer is not
    hidden after xterm loses focus (report by Jeremy Huddleston).
  * add special check for fd_mask on Mac OS X (report by Jeremy
    Huddleston).
  * add dylib to autoconf's suffix list used for checking the result
    from xmkmf, to work with Mac OS X (report by Jeremy Huddleston).
  * correct initialization of bold- and wide-, wide-bold fonts which
    may be set via the utf8Fonts subresource (Debian #347790).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  3 09:55:33 CET 2008 - sndirsch@suse.de

- update to bugfix release xterm-234
  * modify sinstall.sh to use POSIX locale to bypass GNU ls changes
    to date-format.
  * improved/refined  changes for closing bitmap font (patch by
    Andrea Odetti).
  * improve  resize  computation  for situations where the
    negotiation fails,  by  invoking  the  xterm widget's
    core-class resize method (Debian #365602, patch by Jim Paris).
  * restore initialization of terminal's VMIN and VTIME settings,
    from patch #232 changes (patch by Matthieu Herrb).

    PACK_PAIR macro (Debian #459014, analysis by Caetano Jimenez
    Carezzato).
  * minor documentation fixes (patch by Slava Semushin)
  * add  makefile  actions  to  install KOI8RXTerm app-defaults
    file (patch by Julien Cristau).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- set foreground color as well; fixes xterm -rv (Bug #283984)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 31 22:35:40 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- Bugzilla #306943: add xorg-x11 to BuildRequires because of
  ‘bdftopcf’. Let the build fail if ‘bdftopcf’ is missing.
- change app-defaults to use these fonts for wide characters
  when the 10x20 font is used.
- bzip2 source tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 21:34:56 CEST 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- added '*metaSendsEscape: true' to app defaults (Bug #300331)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 13 03:29:19 CEST 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- update to xterm-229:
  * override locale in minstall.sh; change in [233]patch #226 does
    not work in UTF-8 locale (report by Zdenek Sekera).
  * undo an incorrect fix for a memory leak in [234]patch #209
    (Debian #435858).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 11 20:05:58 CEST 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- changed icon to a transparent one (Bug #299596)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 24 17:25:38 CEST 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- update to xterm-228.
  * modify  configure  script  to permit combining --with-utempter and
    --enable-setuid,  e.g.,  for using xterm with the utempter library
    on FreeBSD (report by Andriy Gapon).
  * modify  "Quit"  menu  entry  to  override  the  -hold command-line
    option.
  * add  a  check  in  the startup error-reporting to avoid writing to
    pipe  when  it  has  not  been opened. In that case, report errors
    directly to the standard error.
  * add   OPT_READLINE   definition  to  xtermcfg.hin,  overlooked  in
    [232]patch #205 (report by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo).
  * modify 88colors2.pl and 256colors2.pl, adding -r option to reverse
    the palettes for the extended colors.
  * check for partial overwrite or deletion of multi-column characters
    in  several cases, e.g., insert-character, delete-character, etc.,
    and  fill  the  remainder  of  the  cells used by the multi-column
    characters affected with blanks.
  * correct   character-class   codes   in   wide-character  mode  for
    characters 215, 247 (see also [233]patch #165).
  * fix  missing assignment for UTF-8 parsing in widget initialization
    (Debian #403360).
  * correct  index  expression  used to set line-wrapping flag, making
    selection  from  scrollback  work  consistently  (Debian  #430121,
    report by Vincent Lefevre).
  * amend  changes  to  handshake  in [234]patch #226 to accommodate
    Solaris,  which  relies  on the extra setting of the terminal size
    after   I/O   initialization.  Do  this  by  adding  new  resource
    ptySttySize,  which is false for Linux and MacOS X, i.e., true for
    for  Solaris and other SVR4 platforms, as well as FreeBSD (reports
    by David Wood, Renato Botelho).
  * check  for  X  events  after  cursor-left,  and  carriage  return,
    consistent with indexing operations (comments by Vegard Nossum and
    Ingo Molnar on a mailing-list).
  * initialize  the  .keyboard  structure,  needed  for some platforms
    (such as Solaris) after [235]patch #227 fixes for keysyms (patch
    by David Wood).
  * update config.guess, config.sub
- Bugzilla #293793: avoid requiring the an iso8859* version of
  adobe-helvetica for the menus. The menus are ASCII only anyway at
  the moment, it doesn't matter at all whether a Unicode font
  (iso10646-1) or any of the iso8859* fonts is used, they are all
  identical in the ASCII region anyway.
  Using the iso* wildcard makes xterm work even if the recoded
  versions of the bitmap fonts are missing in a minimal installation
  and only the Unicode versions are there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 12 17:19:32 CEST 2007 - werner@suse.de

- no longer overwrite translation for the key ALT, use altIsNotMeta
  to leave it for users choise using Meta or Alt mode (bug #262330)
- add snooper to the sources which enables to seek for character
  sequences used by e.g. xterm in Alt mode (bug #262330)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  9 21:53:00 CEST 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- no longer package /usr/share/pixmaps to fix build

- obsoletes xterm-225k.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 14 15:48:56 CEST 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- xterm-225k.patch:
  * restore  a special case for cursor-color in ReverseVideo() lost
    in rewrite for patch #224 (report by Adam Sulmicki).
    (Bug #283984)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 29 12:28:01 CEST 2007 - dmueller@suse.de

- add ncurses-devel BuildRequires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 24 22:03:14 CET 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- Patch #225 - 2007/3/24:
  * add useClipping resource to allow clipping to be disabled.
  * use   XftDrawSetClipRectangles  to  work  around  Xft  pixel-trash
    (report by Reuben Thomas).
  * add    configure    option   --enable-tcap-fkeys,   and   resource
    tcapFunctionKeys,   which  can  be  used  to  tell  xterm  to  use
    function-key  definitions  from the termcap (or terminfo) which it
    uses to set $TERM on startup.
  * add  resources altIsNotMeta and altSendsEscape to allow one to use
    Alt-keys  like  the  meta-key  even if they are bound to different
    keycodes (prompted by discussion with Daniel Jacobowitz).
  * revert a change from [229]patch #216 that unnecessarily made the
    meta  modifier override the eightBitInput resource if the alt- and
    meta-modifiers   happened   to  overlap  (report/patch  by  Daniel
    Jacobowitz).
  * correct  associated  font for active icon for colored text (broken
    in [230]patch #224).
  * correct ifdef's for Darwin (patch by Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * add  highlightTextColor  resource, and options -selfg, -selbg like
    xwsh (adapted from patch by Victor Vaile).
  * revise  find_closest_color()  function  to  address  concern about
    borrowing from Tcl/Tk (request by Dan McNichol).
  * add  "spawn-new-terminal"  action,  which  can  be assigned to key
    translation,  allowing  one to spawn a new copy of xterm using the
    current  process'  working directory (adapted from patch by Daniel
    Colascio).
  * improve  select/paste  between UTF-8 and Latin1 xterms by adapting
    the  translations  from  [231]patch #185. Extend that to include
    Unicode fullwidth forms FF00-FF5E. Also modify select/paste of DEC
    line-drawing characters in Latin1 mode to use ASCII characters.
  * add  "Enable  Bell  Urgency"  to  VT Options menu, removed "Enable
    Margin Bell".
  * add  bellIsUrgent  resource to control whether the Urgency hint is
    set/reset.
  * modify  to  set  Urgency  window manager hint on bell, reset it on
    Focus-In event (patch by Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * add   --disable-setgid   configure  option  (request  by  Miroslav
    Lichvar).
  * fix  a  possible  infinite loop in last change to dabbrev-expand()
    (patch by Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * modify  initialization  to set the pty erase value if the erase is
    set  in  the ttyModes resource. This overrides the ptyInitialErase
    setting (request by Lluis Batlle i Rossell).
  * add  initialFont resource to xterm widget, like tek-widget (Debian
    #299669).
  * amend change to boldMode from [232]patch #223 for Debian #347790.
    As  noted  in  Debian #412599, that made xterm no longer match the
    documented  behavior.  Add  new  resource  alwaysBoldMode to allow
    overriding  the comparison between normal/bold fonts when deciding
    whether to use overstriking to simulate bold fonts.
  * restore  background  color  in  ClearCurBackground(),  omitted  in
    changes for [233]patch #223 (report by Miroslav Lichvar).
  * correct  logic  for  repainting  double-width  TrueType characters
    (prompted by test-case for Novell #246573).
  * add  a  check  to  avoid  trying  to  repeat a multibyte character
    (report by Sami Farin).
  * modify  parameter  to  XftNameParse()  to select wide face-name as
    needed,  to  make  -fd  option  work (patch by Mike Fabian, Novell
    #246573).
  * correct  logic  for  mouse  highlight  tracking's  abort sequence,
    broken  in  a  restructuring  modification  from [234]patch #224
    (report by Thomas Wolff).
  * revert the simplification of blinking cursor, since that broke the
    xor'ing introduced in [235]patch #193 (report by Thomas Wolff).
- obsoletes xterm-224i.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 22 17:35:02 CET 2007 - mfabian@suse.de

- add ftp://invisible-island.net/temp/xterm-224i.patch
  (obsoletes fix-fd_option.diff and fixes the redraw problems
  for double width characters mentioned in bug #246573).
- adapt patch a little bit to make it build with --with-utempter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 16:04:31 CET 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- bug-246573-tentative-patch.diff:
  * simplify algorithm for verifying that a font contains double
    width characters (Bug #246573, comment #53/54)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 12:13:16 CET 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- fix-fd_option.diff:
  * finally fixes double-width support (Bug #246573)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 17 13:13:12 CET 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- enabled double-width support; switched to configure (Bug #246573)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 14:33:36 CET 2007 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to xterm-224 (2007/02/11)
  * simplify code for set/reset mode for blinking cursor (patch by
    Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * modify  dabbrev-expand() to restart after the last match (patch by
    Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * add  control  sequences  for enabling/disabling focus in/out event
    reporting (request by Bram Moolenaar).
  * improve  startup  performance  of menus by adding resource setting
    menuLocale which can be set to override X's lengthy initialization
    of  fontsets  -  which  are  seldom  used  for the Xaw popup menus
    (adapted by patch by Dave Coffin).
  * modify  do_precomposition() function and make-compose.sh to handle
    21-bit codes vs the 16-bit codes those were written for, and fix a
    few mis-sorted codes (patch by Thomas Wolff).
  * handle  special  case  in  -cjk_width  which unexpectedly caused a
    character's  width  to change when a combining character (patch by
    Thomas Wolff)
  * fix build for GNU/KFreeBSD (Debian #40111).
  * consolidate GC creation/updating into a single module to reduce GC
    manipulation  (prompted  by  Debian #389476, though a complete fix
    would involve optimizing the scrolling behavior).
  * fix  ifdef  of  xtermCellWidth(),  which  broke for a case without
    TrueType  and  without  wide-character  support  (report by Martin
    Pirker).
  * undo a comparison in handle_translated_exposure which did not work
    due  to  X server optimization. That caused the inner border to be
    repainted  with  unexpected  colors when handling a repaint, e.g.,
    after  switching to/from another workspace (Debian #401726, Redhat
   Bugzilla #223027).
  * allow  -cr option to override cursor color when -ah option is used
    (Debian #406502).
  * add  a  note  in  xterm's  manpage explaining that the -bw (or -w)
    option  is  only  used  by  the  window manager, if at all (Debian
    #405043).
  * make Selection of VT Fonts work with selectToClipboard resource.
  * correct  length  calculation for Selection entry of VT Fonts menu,
    broken since it ignored the actual selection length since X11R4.
  * fixes  for  fontsize  changes  with  -fa  option  (Redhat Bugzilla
    #222340).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 06:21:09 CET 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to xterm-223 (2006/11/30)
  * add   --enable-rectangles  configure  option  (request  by  Martin
    Pirker).
  * correct default value for --with-symlink configure option.
  * fixes configure script macros that use $X_EXTRA_LIBS.
  * modify  configure script to provide support for pre-package config
    versions of Xft (FreeType).
  * add  the Xaw scrollbar translations resource to the xterm manpage,
    add  an example showing how to change the mouse button assignments
    (Debian #382225).
  * amend a change from [227]patch #216, which omitted modifiers for
    control,  meta, etc., if they were mixed with any other modifiers.
    The   intent   of   the   change   was  to  avoid  confusion  with
    XK_Mode_switch  and  XK_ISO_Level3_Shift;  the  check  is now done
     explicitly (report by Daniel Jacobowitz).
  * interpret    a    negative    value    for   modifyCursorKeys   or
    modifyFunctionKeys  resources  to  disable the respective features
    (prompted by Novell #220728).
  * amend  cell-width computation for FreeType from [228]patch #217,
    which  did  not  work  for  VT100  line-drawing characters (Debian
    #399638, GenToo #147111).
  * amend a change from [229]patch #216, which made alt-modifier on a
    cursor-key send a modifier parameter (Novell #220728).
  * correct  an  off-by-one that made DECCRA not work (report/patch by
    Martin Pirker).
  * revert an optimization in SGR_Foreground() and SGR_Background from
    [230]patch #209 (Debian #347722, analysis by Pierre Lombard).
  * fix for boldMode (Debian #347790, patch by Tim Pope).
  * amend  fix  for  -iconic  in  [231]patch  #208,  which broke the
    positioning part of -geom with toolbar configuration.
  * fix  to  prevent  indexing  error in regular expressions (patch by
    Dennis Schneider).
  * fixes  to  make  the  internalBorder  area not change color due to
    reverseVideo and/or related exposure events. The latter was a very
    old bug exposed in [232]patch #196 (report by Neil Hoggarth, also
    Debian #397624).

- bug220728.diff:
  * Essentially the problem reported is that xterm #216 does a more
    complete job of applying modifier parameters to cursor-,
    function- and other keys. Some users would like to disable the
    feature. Patch to allow modifyCursorKeys to be disabled.
    Currently the resource accepts values 0 to 3. This adds a -1 to
    disable the feature. Most users won't want to do this.

    (report by Paul Schenkeveld)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 18:28:29 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to xterm-221
  * fix  for  regular expressions: the code which converted the column
    offset within a line did not check properly for the end of a line,
    and if allowed to match the whole line, would select the beginning
    of  the  following line. If the following line were empty, in turn
    it   would   select   from   the   next,   etc.  (report  by  Sean
    Reifschneider).
  * minor  optimization  of  color  allocation to avoid repainting the
    screen if the corresponding color had not been allocated.
  * fixes for vttests/256colors.pl (report by Egmont Koblinger).
  * add  terminfo  building  block  entries for modifiers of the 6-key
    editing keypad.
  * fix for initialization of tek4014 which broke on QNX 6.1

  * some internal restructuring to separate data for vt100 and tek4014
    widgets.
  * fix  a  few  cases  where  form-events  would be seen by the vt100
    widget when built with the toolbar configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 29 11:19:48 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

-  updated to xterm-218
   * change behavior when encountering an illegal character in a
     title string. Rather than reject the string, translate
     illegal characters into "?" and use the string (requested by
     Thomas Wolff).
   * improve checks for nonprinting characters in title strings
     (report by Samuel Thibault).
   * correct typo in menu labels, changing print-redirect to
     print-redir, making it follow the manpage and match the
     usage for the actions table (report by Samuel Thibault).
   * correct a typo that prevents building with some older systems
     such as Solaris 2.6 (report by Julian Bridle).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 05:43:29 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to xterm-217
  * minor improvements to FreeType font layout and drawing.
  * add  a  check  in  the  ptyInitialErase  logic  to ensure that
    the termcap was read (Redhat Bugzilla #201246).
  * limit  changes  for  reverse-video from patch #216 to cases
    where  the  reverse-video  command-line  option is used (report
    by Zdenek Sekera).
  * correct  bitmap-derived pointsizes for TrueType fonts; they
    should be  proportional  to  the  square  root  of the area of
    the bitmap fonts.
  * add  resources  to specify pointsize of TrueType fonts (request
    by Reuben Thomas).
  * improve  install  of  terminfo  by filtering out harmless
    messages related  to  extended  capabilities. At the same time,
    use ncurses tic  to  compile  the extended capabilities if
    possible (report by Zdenek Sekera).
  * update "xterm+pcfkeys" terminfo entry to correspond to patch
    #216.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  4 16:01:27 CEST 2006 - sndirsch@suse.de

- updated to xterm-216
  * improve handling of ConfigureNotify events by checking if there are
    further events in the queue which obsolete the current one (adapted
    from   rxvt   2.7.5).   Only   the   normal   normal  (non-toolbar)
    configuration is addressed in this patch.
  * several changes to terminfo:
       + incorporate some minor changes from ncurses to help keep these
         synchronized:

           2005-02-26
                   modify  sgr/sgr0  in  xterm-new to improve tgetent's
                   derived "me".

           2006-02-18
                   remove ncv flag from xterm-16color

           2006-06-24
                   improve  xterm-256color  by  combining  the 16-color
                   setaf/setab  strings with SGR 48, and cancelling the
                   setf/setb strings.

       + use extended function-key definitions for xterm-sun, xterm-sco
         entries.
       + add    terminfo    building-blocks    corresponding   to   the
         modifyFunctionKeys and modifyCursorKeys resources.
  * ifdef'd  Sun  function-key feature to make it optional, like HP and
    SCO.
  * extend  table  for  termcap-query  feature through F63, and updated
    tcapquery.pl to match.
  * modify  logic  for  function-key input processing to allow function
    key  numbers  which are constructed by control- and shift-modifiers
    to extend beyond X's hardcoded limit of 35.
  * add control sequence to set or reset the eightBitInput resource.
  * change  default  resource  modifyFunctionKeys to 2 to avoid sending
    SS3 with parameters (report by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo).
  * add  control  sequences for setting and resetting the values of the
    modifyCursorKeys, modifyFunctionKeys and modifyOtherKeys resources.
  * add modifyFunctionKeys resource like modifyCursorKeys. Setting this
    to  zero  allows  one  to  use  the control- and shift-modifiers to
    construct  function  key strings, for terminals using many function
    keys, e.g., for xterm-sun or xterm-sco.
  * modify screen responses and function-key logic to reduce the number
    of  writes  made,  to make it less likely that an application would
    read  only part of a function-key in a read operation (suggested by
    John E Urbanczyk).
  * add  combiningChars  resource, which allows the user to specify the
    maximum  number  of  combining characters that xterm will store for
    each  cell  in  wide-character  mode (prompted by request by Markus
    Kuhn to increase the limit from 2).
  * improve logic in metaSendsEscape in case the Alt- and Meta-keys are
    mapped  to  different modifiers. That allows one to use the Alt-key
    for  shifting  in  the eightBitInput and use a Meta-key modifier to
    prefix the result with an <ESC>.
  * improve  modifyCursorKeys  logic to prevent it from modifying codes
    where  eightBitInput  or  metaSendsEscape  are  set (request by Dan
    Nicolaescu).
  * improve modifyCursorKeys logic to prevent it from changing the user
    input when other modifiers such as AltGr are used (report by Thomas
    Wolff).
  * extend  modifyCursorKeys  to  include  the  numeric  keypad when in
    application mode.
  * improve  -reverse  (-rv)  option  (patch  by Jason Vas Dias, Redhat
    #189161).
  * workaround  for  color resources on Fedora-5 which made the toolbar
    colors inconsistent.
  * corrected  calls  used  for  --disable-setuid option, add debugging
    traces to help diagnose this area.
  * modify  configure  script to ensure that USE_UTMP_SETGID is defined
    only  if  the check for POSIX saved-ids succeeds, or corresponds to
    one of the BSD systems known to have a workable setegid function.
  * extend configure check for POSIX saved-ids to include BSD systems
  * modify  CF_SYSV  configure  macro  to  work with gcc on HPUX 10.20,
    whose broken <term.h> relies on including <termios.h>.
  * change  order of setuid/setgid ifdef checks in Imakefile to make it
    simpler  to  produce  a  setgid  install,  allowing  the  latter to
    override the former (prompted by an XFree86 commit).
  * adapt  a  fix  for  setgid  support from subsequent XFree86 changes
    (patch by Emanuele Giaquinta).
  * further improve setgid support (patches by Emanuele Giaquinta).

  * modify computation of rows/columns on resize to avoid extending
    beyond the given limits, e.g., if resizing in response to a
    "maximize" in Gnome or KDE which do not use the window manager
    hints for this case (Debian #289123, Novell #61153).

  * correct variable used to store temporary result from lookup of
    bold font, when initializing the wide-bold-font data and no
    immediate match is found by asking for a bold variant of the
    wide-font. The result was to use overstriking rather than the
    actual bold font (Debian #318162, patch by Eugene Konev).
