- Update to version 1.3.3:
  * This release includes a pair of changes to align with the
    xserver-21.x release series - it prints the version without
    the leading "1." for 21.x xservers, and it changes the default
    for building DMX support from --with-dmx to --without-dmx as
    DMX is no longer included in the 21.x xservers.
    (The DMX support in xdpyinfo is not removed in this release,
     and can be enabled at build time with the --with-dmx flag to
     configure, but may be fully removed in a future release of
     xdpyinfo.)
