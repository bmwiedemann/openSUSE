- Update to version 1.3.4
  * This release stops compiling support for the XF86-Misc extension by
    default, and thus stops linking with the deprecated libXxf86misc
    library by default.  This support can still be enabled for now by
    passing --with-xf86misc to the configure script, but as the server
    side of this extension was removed in the xserver-1.6.0 release in 2008
    there is little reason to do so, and the support may be removed entirely
    in a future release of xdpyinfo.
- we have xorg-server >= 1.6 since sle11-sp1, so we are on the safe
  side with our customers

- Update to version 1.3.3:
  * This release includes a pair of changes to align with the
    xserver-21.x release series - it prints the version without
    the leading "1." for 21.x xservers, and it changes the default
    for building DMX support from --with-dmx to --without-dmx as
    DMX is no longer included in the 21.x xservers.
    (The DMX support in xdpyinfo is not removed in this release,
     and can be enabled at build time with the --with-dmx flag to
     configure, but may be fully removed in a future release of
     xdpyinfo.)

    vars in outer loop.
