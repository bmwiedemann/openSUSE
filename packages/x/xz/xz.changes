Fri Nov 18 10:56:35 UTC 2022 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 5.2.8:
  * xz:
    - If xz cannot remove an input file when it should, this
      is now treated as a warning (exit status 2) instead of
      an error (exit status 1). This matches GNU gzip and it
      is more logical as at that point the output file has
      already been successfully closed.
    - Fix handling of .xz files with an unsupported check type.
      Previously such printed a warning message but then xz
      behaved as if an error had occurred (didn't decompress,
      exit status 1). Now a warning is printed, decompression
      is done anyway, and exit status is 2. This used to work
      slightly before 5.0.0. In practice this bug matters only
      if xz has been built with some check types disabled. As
      instructed in PACKAGERS, such builds should be done in
      special situations only.
    - Fix "xz -dc --single-stream tests/files/good-0-empty.xz"
      which failed with "Internal error (bug)". That is,
      --single-stream was broken if the first .xz stream in
      the input file didn't contain any uncompressed data.
    - Fix displaying file sizes in the progress indicator when
      working in passthru mode and there are multiple input files.
      Just like "gzip -cdf", "xz -cdf" works like "cat" when the
      input file isn't a supported compressed file format. In
      this case the file size counters weren't reset between
      files so with multiple input files the progress indicator
      displayed an incorrect (too large) value.
  * liblzma:
    - API docs in lzma/container.h:
        * Update the list of decoder flags in the decoder
          function docs.
        * Explain LZMA_CONCATENATED behavior with .lzma files
          in lzma_auto_decoder() docs.
    - OpenBSD: Use HW_NCPUONLINE to detect the number of
      available hardware threads in lzma_physmem().
    - Fix use of wrong macro to detect x86 SSE2 support.
      __SSE2_MATH__ was used with GCC/Clang but the correct
      one is __SSE2__. The first one means that SSE2 is used
      for floating point math which is irrelevant here.
      The affected SSE2 code isn't used on x86-64 so this affects
      only 32-bit x86 builds that use -msse2 without -mfpmath=sse
      (there is no runtime detection for SSE2). It improves LZMA
      compression speed (not decompression).
    - Fix the build with Intel C compiler 2021 (ICC, not ICX)
      on Linux. It defines __GNUC__ to 10 but doesn't support
      the __symver__ attribute introduced in GCC 10.
  * Scripts: Ignore warnings from xz by using --quiet --no-warn.
  This is needed if the input .xz files use an unsupported
  check type.
  * Translations:
    - Updated Croatian and Turkish translations.
    - One new translations wasn't included because it needed
      technical fixes. It will be in upcoming 5.4.0. No new
      translations will be added to the 5.2.x branch anymore.
    - Renamed the French man page translation file from
      fr_FR.po to fr.po and thus also its install directory
      (like /usr/share/man/fr_FR -> .../fr).
    - Man page translations for upcoming 5.4.0 are now handled
      in the Translation Project.
  * Update doc/faq.txt a little so it's less out-of-date.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 20:36:09 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Move localised man pages to lang subpackage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 21:20:14 UTC 2022 - C J <c.j@tuta.io>

- update to 5.2.7:
  * liblzma:
    - Add API doc note about the .xz decoder LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR bug.
    - Add dest and src NULL checks to lzma_index_cat.
      The documentation states LZMA_PROG_ERROR can be returned from
      lzma_index_cat. Previously, lzma_index_cat could not return
      LZMA_PROG_ERROR. Now, the validation is similar to
      lzma_index_append, which does a NULL check on the index
      parameter.
    - Fix copying of check type statistics in lzma_index_cat().
      The check type of the last Stream in dest was never copied to
      dest->checks (the code tried to copy it but it was done too late).
      This meant that the value returned by lzma_index_checks() would
      only include the check type of the last Stream when multiple
      lzma_indexes had been concatenated.
      In xz --list this meant that the summary would only list the
      check type of the last Stream, so in this sense this was only
      a visual bug. However, it's possible that some applications
      use this information for purposes other than merely showing
      it to the users in an informational message. I'm not aware of
      such applications though and it's quite possible that such
      applications don't exist.
      Regular streamed decompression in xz or any other application
      doesn't use lzma_index_cat() and so this bug cannot affect them.
    - Stream decoder: Fix restarting after LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR.
      If lzma_code() returns LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR it is now possible
      to use lzma_memlimit_set() to increase the limit and continue
      decoding. This was supposed to work from the beginning but
      there was a bug. With other decoders (.lzma or threaded .xz)
      this already worked correctly.
    - lzma_filters_copy: Keep dest[] unmodified if an error occurs.
      lzma_stream_encoder() and lzma_stream_encoder_mt() always assumed
      this. Before this patch, failing lzma_filters_copy() could result
      in free(invalid_pointer) or invalid memory reads in stream_encoder.c
      or stream_encoder_mt.c.
      To trigger this, allocating memory for a filter options structure
      has to fail. These are tiny allocations so in practice they very
      rarely fail.
      Certain badness in the filter chain array could also make
      lzma_filters_copy() fail but both stream_encoder.c and
      stream_encoder_mt.c validate the filter chain before
      trying to copy it, so the crash cannot occur this way.
    - lzma_index_append: Add missing integer overflow check.
      The documentation in src/liblzma/api/lzma/index.h suggests that
      both the unpadded (compressed) size and the uncompressed size
      are checked for overflow, but only the unpadded size was checked.
      The uncompressed check is done first since that is more likely to
      occur than the unpadded or index field size overflows.
    - Vaccinate against an ill patch from RHEL/CentOS 7.
      
  * xzgrep:
    - Fix compatibility with old shells.
      Turns out that some old shells don't like apostrophes (') inside
      command substitutions. The problem was introduced by commits
      69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6 (2022-03-29),
      bd7b290f3fe4faeceb7d3497ed9bf2e6ed5e7dc5 (2022-07-18), and
      a648978b20495b7aa4a8b029c5a810b5ad9d08ff (2022-07-19).
      5.2.6 is the only stable release that included
      this problem.
      
  * Translations: Add Turkish translation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 20:50:23 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.2.6 (CVE-2022-1271, bsc#1198062):
  * xz:
    - The --keep option now accepts symlinks, hardlinks, and
      setuid, setgid, and sticky files.
    - When copying metadata from the source file to the destination
      file, don't try to set the group (GID) if it is already set
      correctly. This avoids a failure on OpenBSD (and possibly on
      a few other OSes) where files may get created so that their
      group doesn't belong to the user, and fchown(2) can fail even
      if it needs to do nothing.
    - Cap --memlimit-compress to 2000 MiB instead of 4020 MiB on
      MIPS32 because on MIPS32 userspace processes are limited
      to 2 GiB of address space.
  * liblzma:
    - Fixed a missing error-check in the threaded encoder. If a
      small memory allocation fails, a .xz file with an invalid
      Index field would be created. Decompressing such a file would
      produce the correct output but result in an error at the end.
      Thus this is a "mild" data corruption bug. Note that while
      a failed memory allocation can trigger the bug, it cannot
      cause invalid memory access.
    - The decoder for .lzma files now supports files that have
      uncompressed size stored in the header and still use the
      end of payload marker (end of stream marker) at the end
      of the LZMA stream. Such files are rare but, according to
      the documentation in LZMA SDK, they are valid.
      doc/lzma-file-format.txt was updated too.
    - Improved 32-bit x86 assembly files:
        * Support Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)
        * Use non-executable stack on FreeBSD.
  * xzgrep:
    - Fixed arbitrary command injection via a malicious filename
      (CVE-2022-1271, ZDI-CAN-16587). A standalone patch for
      this was released to the public on 2022-04-07. A slight
      robustness improvement has been made since then and, if
      using GNU or *BSD grep, a new faster method is now used
      that doesn't use the old sed-based construct at all. This
      also fixes bad output with GNU grep >= 3.5 (2020-09-27)
      when xzgrepping binary files.
    - Fixed detection of corrupt .bz2 files.
    - Improved error handling to fix exit status in some situations
      and to fix handling of signals: in some situations a signal
      didn't make xzgrep exit when it clearly should have. It's
      possible that the signal handling still isn't quite perfect
      but hopefully it's good enough.
    - Documented exit statuses on the man page.
    - xzegrep and xzfgrep now use "grep -E" and "grep -F" instead
      of the deprecated egrep and fgrep commands.
    - Fixed parsing of the options -E, -F, -G, -P, and -X. The
      problem occurred when multiple options were specied in
      a single argument, for example,
          echo foo | xzgrep -Fe foo
      treated foo as a filename because -Fe wasn't correctly
      split into -F -e.
    - Added zstd support.
  * xzdiff/xzcmp:
    - Fixed wrong exit status. Exit status could be 2 when the
      correct value is 1.
    - Documented on the man page that exit status of 2 is used
      for decompression errors.
    - Added zstd support.
  * xzless:
    - Fix less(1) version detection. It failed if the version number
      from "less -V" contained a dot.

- Upgrade old rpm constructs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 11:11:48 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 5.2.5:
  * liblzma:
    - Fixed several C99/C11 conformance bugs. Now the code is clean
      under gcc/clang -fsanitize=undefined. Some of these changes
      might have a negative effect on performance with old GCC
      versions or compilers other than GCC and Clang. The configure
      option --enable-unsafe-type-punning can be used to (mostly)
      restore the old behavior but it shouldn't normally be used.
    - Improved API documentation of lzma_properties_decode().
    - Added a very minor encoder speed optimization.
  * xz:
    - Fixed a crash in "xz -dcfv not_an_xz_file". All four options
      were required to trigger it. The crash occurred in the
      progress indicator code when xz was in passthru mode where
      xz works like "cat".
    - Fixed an integer overflow with 32-bit off_t. It could happen
      when decompressing a file that has a long run of zero bytes
      which xz would try to write as a sparse file. Since the build
      system enables large file support by default, off_t is
      normally 64-bit even on 32-bit systems.
    - Fixes for --flush-timeout:
        * Fix semi-busy-waiting.
        * Avoid unneeded flushes when no new input has arrived
          since the previous flush was completed.
    - Added a special case for 32-bit xz: If --memlimit-compress is
      used to specify a limit that exceeds 4020 MiB, the limit will
      be set to 4020 MiB. The values "0" and "max" aren't affected
      by this and neither is decompression. This hack can be
      helpful when a 32-bit xz has access to 4 GiB address space
      but the specified memlimit exceeds 4 GiB. This can happen
      e.g. with some scripts.
    - Capsicum sandbox is now enabled by default where available
      (FreeBSD >= 10). The sandbox debug messages (xz -vv) were
      removed since they seemed to be more annoying than useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Do not recommend lang package. The lang package already has a supplements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 11:11:38 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- xz 5.2.4:
  * liblzma:
    - Allow 0 as memory usage limit instead of returning
      LZMA_PROG_ERROR. Now 0 is treated as if 1 byte was specified,
      which effectively is the same as 0.
    - Use "noexcept" keyword instead of "throw()" in the public
      headers when a C++11 (or newer standard) compiler is used.
    - Added a portability fix for recent Intel C Compilers.
  * xz:
    - Fix "xz --list --robot missing_or_bad_file.xz" which would
      try to print an unitialized string and thus produce garbage
      output. Since the exit status is non-zero, most uses of such
      a command won't try to interpret the garbage output.
    - "xz --list foo.xz" could print "Internal error (bug)" in a
      corner case where a specific memory usage limit had been set.

- xz 5.2.3:
  * xz: always close a file before trying to delete it to avoid
    problems on some operating system and file system combinations.
  * C99/C11 conformance fixes to liblzma. The issues affected at
    least some builds using link-time optimizations.

Thu Dec 25 20:23:28 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- xz 5.2.0:
  * liblzma:
    - Added support for multi-threaded compression
    - Made the uses of lzma_allocator const correct.
    - Added lzma_block_uncomp_encode() to create uncompressed
      .xz Blocks using LZMA2 uncompressed chunks.
    - Added support for LZMA_IGNORE_CHECK.
    - A few speed optimizations were made.
    - Added support for symbol versioning. It is enabled by default
      on GNU/Linux, other GNU-based systems, and FreeBSD.
  * xz:
    - Fixed a race condition in the signal handling
    - Multi-threaded decompression can be enabled with the
      --threads (-T) option.
    - New command line options in xz: --single-stream,
      --block-size=SIZE, --block-list=SIZES,
      --flush-timeout=TIMEOUT, and --ignore-check.
    - xz -lvv now shows the minimum xz version that is required to
       decompress the file. Currently it is 5.0.0 for all supported
      .xz files except files with empty LZMA2 streams require 5.0.2.
  * xzdiff and xzgrep now support .lzo files if lzop is installed.
    The .tzo suffix is also recognized as a shorthand for .tar.lzo.

    - Fix lzma_index_init(). It could crash if memory allocation
      failed.
    - Fix the possibility of an incorrect LZMA_BUF_ERROR when a BCJ
      filter is used and the application only provides exactly as
      much output space as is the uncompressed size of the file.
    - Fix a bug in doc/examples_old/xz_pipe_decompress.c. It didn't
      check if the last call to lzma_code() really returned
      LZMA_STREAM_END, which made the program think that truncated
      files are valid.
    - New example programs in doc/examples (old programs are now in
      doc/examples_old). These have more comments and more detailed
      error handling.
  * Fix "xz -lvv foo.xz". It could crash on some corrupted files.
  * Fix output of "xz --robot -lv" and "xz --robot -lvv" which
    incorrectly printed the filename also in the "foo (x/x)" format.
  * Fix exit status of "xzdiff foo.xz bar.xz".
  * Fix exit status of "xzgrep foo binary_file".
  * Fix portability to EBCDIC systems.
  * Fix a configure issue on AIX with the XL C compiler. See INSTALL
    for details.

- Update to version 5.0.3
    * liblzma fixes:

        - A memory leak was fixed.

        - lzma_stream_buffer_encode() no longer creates an empty .xz
          Block if encoding an empty buffer. Such an empty Block with
          LZMA2 data would trigger a bug in 5.0.1 and older (see the
          first bullet point in 5.0.2 notes). When releasing 5.0.2,
          I thought that no encoder creates this kind of files but
          I was wrong.

        - Validate function arguments better in a few functions. Most
          importantly, specifying an unsupported integrity check to
          lzma_stream_buffer_encode() no longer creates a corrupt .xz
          file. Probably no application tries to do that, so this
          shouldn't be a big problem in practice.

        - Document that lzma_block_buffer_encode(),
          lzma_easy_buffer_encode(), lzma_stream_encoder(), and
          lzma_stream_buffer_encode() may return LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK.

        - The return values of the _memusage() functions are now
          documented better.

    * Fix command name detection in xzgrep. xzegrep and xzfgrep now
      correctly use egrep and fgrep instead of grep.

    * French translation was added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 20:43:05 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to version 5.0.2
    * LZMA2 decompressor now correctly accepts LZMA2 streams with no
      uncompressed data. Previously it considered them corrupt. The
      bug can affect applications that use raw LZMA2 streams. It is
      very unlikely to affect .xz files because no compressor creates
      .xz files with empty LZMA2 streams. (Empty .xz files are a
      different thing than empty LZMA2 streams.)

    * "xz --suffix=.foo filename.foo" now refuses to compress the
      file due to it already having the suffix .foo. It was already
      documented on the man page, but the code lacked the test.

    * "xzgrep -l foo bar.xz" works now.

    * Polish translation was added. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Rename to xz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 13:53:18 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.7.
  * If "lzma -t" is run on a corrupt file or interrupted by a signal,
    don't unlink /dev/null.

  * Partial fix to race conditions where a signal could make lzma to
    unlink both the source and destination files. Now it cannot lose
    data anymore, but with bad luck an incomplete file may be left
    on the disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 22:04:25 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.6.
  * Always use 32-bit integer to hold probability variables. Earlier,
    these were 64-bit on 64-bit architectures, which hurt cache
    efficiency in the CPU, and thus performance of LZMA. 32-bit
    architectures are not affected by this change.
  * Fix a theoretical data corruption bug in the LZMA encoder. It is
    about overflowing a 32-bit integer, whose typical value stays below
    five. I don't know if it is actually possible to construct to a file
    that could make it overflow. Even if it were possible, it would "only"
    make the output file corrupt so that it is 4 GiB too small; there
    are no other security risks. Now the integer is 64-bit to be sure
    it won't overflow.
  * Add support for copying timestamps on operating systems that support
    setting timestamps only by filename, not by file descriptor.
  * Several portability fixes were made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  9 11:51:42 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Revert last changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  6 22:36:09 CEST 2008 - bk@suse.de

- ci removed #neededforbuild while mbuild converts to BuildRequires
- bzip2 source to save space (not lzma, so it can be built in <11.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  6 14:24:02 CEST 2008 - bk@suse.de

- run the package-provided self-test by adding a call to 'make check'
- use %configure instead of equivalent configure call with options
- improved to allow building in SLES and non-SUSE repositories, eg:
  - replace obsolete nostatic patch with check for static objects
  - use more generic wildcards in the file list for manual pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 19:20:31 CET 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Fix installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 13:32:06 CET 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.5.
  * The percentage shown when --verbose is used, works again. Also some
    typos were fixed from the messages printed by --verbose.
  * Several small portability fixes were made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  4 07:12:26 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- Version 4.32.4
  * Ignore command line switch --format=alone. This way current scripts
    can be written so that they will produce LZMA_Alone format files
    even with the new command line tool once it is finishes along with
    liblzma.
  * The command line tool now tells if the user tries to decode files
    in the new .lzma format. The message recommends upgrading to newer
    LZMA Utils.
  * Added some internal consistency checks to liblzmadec, so that it
    doesn't crash if given lzmadec_stream whose initialization failed.
    Some applications using zlib and libbzip2 don't check if
    initialization was successful, and expect that error gets caught
    safely later.
- disable static libraries
- remove liblzmadec.la that has empty dependency_libs
- do not link utils statically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 14:12:12 CET 2007 - dmueller@suse.de
