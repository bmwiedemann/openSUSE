Mon Jun  7 11:45:15 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Upgrade old rpm constructs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 18 11:11:48 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 5.2.5:
  * liblzma:
    - Fixed several C99/C11 conformance bugs. Now the code is clean
      under gcc/clang -fsanitize=undefined. Some of these changes
      might have a negative effect on performance with old GCC
      versions or compilers other than GCC and Clang. The configure
      option --enable-unsafe-type-punning can be used to (mostly)
      restore the old behavior but it shouldn't normally be used.
    - Improved API documentation of lzma_properties_decode().
    - Added a very minor encoder speed optimization.
  * xz:
    - Fixed a crash in "xz -dcfv not_an_xz_file". All four options
      were required to trigger it. The crash occurred in the
      progress indicator code when xz was in passthru mode where
      xz works like "cat".
    - Fixed an integer overflow with 32-bit off_t. It could happen
      when decompressing a file that has a long run of zero bytes
      which xz would try to write as a sparse file. Since the build
      system enables large file support by default, off_t is
      normally 64-bit even on 32-bit systems.
    - Fixes for --flush-timeout:
        * Fix semi-busy-waiting.
        * Avoid unneeded flushes when no new input has arrived
          since the previous flush was completed.
    - Added a special case for 32-bit xz: If --memlimit-compress is
      used to specify a limit that exceeds 4020 MiB, the limit will
      be set to 4020 MiB. The values "0" and "max" aren't affected
      by this and neither is decompression. This hack can be
      helpful when a 32-bit xz has access to 4 GiB address space
      but the specified memlimit exceeds 4 GiB. This can happen
      e.g. with some scripts.
    - Capsicum sandbox is now enabled by default where available
      (FreeBSD >= 10). The sandbox debug messages (xz -vv) were
      removed since they seemed to be more annoying than useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 19 07:49:19 UTC 2019 - Ludwig Nussel <lnussel@suse.de>

- Do not recommend lang package. The lang package already has a supplements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 08:22:51 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 21 13:05:05 UTC 2019 - Kristýna Streitová <kstreitova@suse.com>

- add SUSE-Public-Domain licence as some parts of xz utils (liblzma,
  xz, xzdec, lzmadec, documentation, translated messages, tests,
  debug, extra directory) are in public domain licence [bsc#1135709]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 11:11:38 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- xz 5.2.4:
  * liblzma:
    - Allow 0 as memory usage limit instead of returning
      LZMA_PROG_ERROR. Now 0 is treated as if 1 byte was specified,
      which effectively is the same as 0.
    - Use "noexcept" keyword instead of "throw()" in the public
      headers when a C++11 (or newer standard) compiler is used.
    - Added a portability fix for recent Intel C Compilers.
  * xz:
    - Fix "xz --list --robot missing_or_bad_file.xz" which would
      try to print an unitialized string and thus produce garbage
      output. Since the exit status is non-zero, most uses of such
      a command won't try to interpret the garbage output.
    - "xz --list foo.xz" could print "Internal error (bug)" in a
      corner case where a specific memory usage limit had been set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 15:41:58 CET 2018 - kukuk@suse.de

- Use %license instead of %doc [bsc#1082318]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 10 10:50:01 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

Sat Dec 31 22:17:33 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- xz 5.2.3:
  * xz: always close a file before trying to delete it to avoid
    problems on some operating system and file system combinations.
  * C99/C11 conformance fixes to liblzma. The issues affected at
    least some builds using link-time optimizations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 25 20:23:28 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- xz 5.2.0:
  * liblzma:
    - Added support for multi-threaded compression
    - Made the uses of lzma_allocator const correct.
    - Added lzma_block_uncomp_encode() to create uncompressed
      .xz Blocks using LZMA2 uncompressed chunks.
    - Added support for LZMA_IGNORE_CHECK.
    - A few speed optimizations were made.
    - Added support for symbol versioning. It is enabled by default
      on GNU/Linux, other GNU-based systems, and FreeBSD.
  * xz:
    - Fixed a race condition in the signal handling
    - Multi-threaded decompression can be enabled with the
      --threads (-T) option.
    - New command line options in xz: --single-stream,
      --block-size=SIZE, --block-list=SIZES,
      --flush-timeout=TIMEOUT, and --ignore-check.
    - xz -lvv now shows the minimum xz version that is required to
       decompress the file. Currently it is 5.0.0 for all supported
      .xz files except files with empty LZMA2 streams require 5.0.2.
  * xzdiff and xzgrep now support .lzo files if lzop is installed.
    The .tzo suffix is also recognized as a shorthand for .tar.lzo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 25 20:17:06 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- xz 5.0.8:
  * Fixed an old bug in xzgrep that affected OpenBSD and probably
    a few other operating systems too.

Tue Sep 23 00:11:27 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- xz 5.0.7:
  * Fix regressions introduced in 5.0.6:
    - Fix building with non-GNU make.
    - Fix invalid Libs.private value in liblzma.pc which broke
      static linking against liblzma if the linker flags were
      taken from pkg-config.
- include changes from 5.0.6:
  * xzgrep now exits with status 0 if at least one file matched.
  * A few minor portability and build system fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    .lzma files that have less common settings in the headers
    (dictionary size other than 2^n or 2^n + 2^(n-1), or uncompressed
    size greater than 256 GiB).
  * xz:
    - Fixes and improvements to error handling.
    - Various fixes to the man page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 27 11:10:13 UTC 2012 - sweet_f_a@gmx.de

- Update to version 5.0.4
  * liblzma:
    - Fix lzma_index_init(). It could crash if memory allocation
      failed.
    - Fix the possibility of an incorrect LZMA_BUF_ERROR when a BCJ
      filter is used and the application only provides exactly as
      much output space as is the uncompressed size of the file.
    - Fix a bug in doc/examples_old/xz_pipe_decompress.c. It didn't
      check if the last call to lzma_code() really returned
      LZMA_STREAM_END, which made the program think that truncated
      files are valid.
    - New example programs in doc/examples (old programs are now in
      doc/examples_old). These have more comments and more detailed
      error handling.
  * Fix "xz -lvv foo.xz". It could crash on some corrupted files.
  * Fix output of "xz --robot -lv" and "xz --robot -lvv" which
    incorrectly printed the filename also in the "foo (x/x)" format.
  * Fix exit status of "xzdiff foo.xz bar.xz".
  * Fix exit status of "xzgrep foo binary_file".
  * Fix portability to EBCDIC systems.
  * Fix a configure issue on AIX with the XL C compiler. See INSTALL
    for details.
  * Update French, German, Italian, and Polish translations

Wed Jun  8 19:25:51 UTC 2011 - coolo@novell.com

- Update to version 5.0.3
    * liblzma fixes:

        - A memory leak was fixed.

        - lzma_stream_buffer_encode() no longer creates an empty .xz
          Block if encoding an empty buffer. Such an empty Block with
          LZMA2 data would trigger a bug in 5.0.1 and older (see the
          first bullet point in 5.0.2 notes). When releasing 5.0.2,
          I thought that no encoder creates this kind of files but
          I was wrong.

        - Validate function arguments better in a few functions. Most
          importantly, specifying an unsupported integrity check to
          lzma_stream_buffer_encode() no longer creates a corrupt .xz
          file. Probably no application tries to do that, so this
          shouldn't be a big problem in practice.

        - Document that lzma_block_buffer_encode(),
          lzma_easy_buffer_encode(), lzma_stream_encoder(), and
          lzma_stream_buffer_encode() may return LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK.

        - The return values of the _memusage() functions are now
          documented better.

    * Fix command name detection in xzgrep. xzegrep and xzfgrep now
      correctly use egrep and fgrep instead of grep.

    * French translation was added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 20:43:05 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to version 5.0.2
    * LZMA2 decompressor now correctly accepts LZMA2 streams with no
      uncompressed data. Previously it considered them corrupt. The
      bug can affect applications that use raw LZMA2 streams. It is
      very unlikely to affect .xz files because no compressor creates
      .xz files with empty LZMA2 streams. (Empty .xz files are a
      different thing than empty LZMA2 streams.)

    * "xz --suffix=.foo filename.foo" now refuses to compress the
      file due to it already having the suffix .foo. It was already
      documented on the man page, but the code lacked the test.

    * "xzgrep -l foo bar.xz" works now.

    * Polish translation was added. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  4 17:54:21 UTC 2011 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Update to version 5.0.1
*  Fix --force on setuid/setgid/sticky and multi-hardlink files.
*  Add alloc_size and malloc attributes to a few functions.
*  Fix gzip and bzip2 support in xzdiff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 18:47:04 UTC 2010 - cristian.rodriguez@opensuse.org

- Use compiler profile information, makes xz marginally faster
  (around 1-2 secs)

    are now stable.
  * The memory usage limit is now disabled by default
  * Added support for XZ_DEFAULTS environment variable
  * The compression settings associated with the preset levels
    have been changed,they are now less likely to make compression worse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 11 12:44:41 CET 2009 - coolo@suse.de

- fix devel symlink

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  6 13:50:53 CET 2009 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to xz-4.999.8beta.
  See git://ctrl.tukaani.org/lzma-utils.git.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  7 10:26:30 CET 2009 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to xz-4.999.7beta.
  See git://ctrl.tukaani.org/lzma-utils.git.
- Rename to xz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 13:53:18 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.7.
  * If "lzma -t" is run on a corrupt file or interrupted by a signal,
    don't unlink /dev/null.

  * Partial fix to race conditions where a signal could make lzma to
    unlink both the source and destination files. Now it cannot lose
    data anymore, but with bad luck an incomplete file may be left
    on the disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 14 22:04:25 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.6.
  * Always use 32-bit integer to hold probability variables. Earlier,
    these were 64-bit on 64-bit architectures, which hurt cache
    efficiency in the CPU, and thus performance of LZMA. 32-bit
    architectures are not affected by this change.
  * Fix a theoretical data corruption bug in the LZMA encoder. It is
    about overflowing a 32-bit integer, whose typical value stays below
    five. I don't know if it is actually possible to construct to a file
    that could make it overflow. Even if it were possible, it would "only"
    make the output file corrupt so that it is 4 GiB too small; there
    are no other security risks. Now the integer is 64-bit to be sure
    it won't overflow.
  * Add support for copying timestamps on operating systems that support
    setting timestamps only by filename, not by file descriptor.
  * Several portability fixes were made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  9 11:51:42 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Revert last changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  6 22:36:09 CEST 2008 - bk@suse.de

- ci removed #neededforbuild while mbuild converts to BuildRequires
- bzip2 source to save space (not lzma, so it can be built in <11.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  6 14:24:02 CEST 2008 - bk@suse.de

- run the package-provided self-test by adding a call to 'make check'
- use %configure instead of equivalent configure call with options
- improved to allow building in SLES and non-SUSE repositories, eg:
  - replace obsolete nostatic patch with check for static objects
  - use more generic wildcards in the file list for manual pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 19:20:31 CET 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Fix installation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  4 13:32:06 CET 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to lzma-4.32.5.
  * The percentage shown when --verbose is used, works again. Also some
    typos were fixed from the messages printed by --verbose.
  * Several small portability fixes were made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  4 07:12:26 CET 2008 - crrodriguez@suse.de

- Version 4.32.4
  * Ignore command line switch --format=alone. This way current scripts
    can be written so that they will produce LZMA_Alone format files
    even with the new command line tool once it is finishes along with
    liblzma.
  * The command line tool now tells if the user tries to decode files
    in the new .lzma format. The message recommends upgrading to newer
    LZMA Utils.
  * Added some internal consistency checks to liblzmadec, so that it
    doesn't crash if given lzmadec_stream whose initialization failed.
    Some applications using zlib and libbzip2 don't check if
    initialization was successful, and expect that error gets caught
    safely later.
- disable static libraries
- remove liblzmadec.la that has empty dependency_libs
- do not link utils statically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 14:12:12 CET 2007 - dmueller@suse.de

- update to 4.32.3:
  * rare file content loss bugs fixed (did not check for error upon close())
  * permissions copying fixed
