  <title>Xsynth an analog-style (VCAs-VCF-VCO) synth plugin</title>
  <description>The xsynth-dssi  package contains the Xsynth-DSSI plugin,
a classic-analog (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software synthesizer
with an editor GUI. Xsynth-DSSI was written by Sean Bolton,
and was based on Steve Brooke's Xsynth code, but has since
aquired polyphonic operation, band-limited oscillators,
a better filter mode, and velocity-sensitive envelopes.
