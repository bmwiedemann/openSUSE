%description
xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.
It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other
libraries. It can serve as an alternative to mate-settings-daemon for users
who are not using the MATE desktop environment but who still run GTK+
applications and want to configure things such as themes, font
antialiasing/hinting, and UI sound effects.
