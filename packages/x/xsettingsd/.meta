  <title>Provides settings to X11 applications</title>
  <description>xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.
It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other libraries. It can serve as an alternative to mate-settings-daemon for users who are not using the MATE desktop environment but who still run GTK+ applications and want to configure things such as themes, font antialiasing/hinting, and UI sound effects.</description>
