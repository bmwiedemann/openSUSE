  <title>xroachng</title>
  <description>The classic xroach game for X11: displays disgusting cockroaches on your root
window. These creepy crawlies scamper around until they find a window to
hide under. Whenever you move or iconify a window, the exposed beetles again
scamper for cover.

Adapted for desktop environments like Gnome and KDE. Still works for FVWM, TWM
and the like.</description>
