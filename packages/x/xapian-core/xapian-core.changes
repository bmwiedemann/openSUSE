- Update to 1.4.9:
  * API:
    + Document::add_posting(): Fix bugs with the change in 1.4.8 to more
      efficiently handle insertion of a batch of extra positions in ascending
      order.  These could lead to missing positions and corrupted encoded
      positional data.
  * remote backend:
    + Avoid hang if remote connection shutdown fails by not waiting for the
      connection to close in this situation.  Seems to fix occasional hangs seen on
      macOS.  Patch from Germán M. Bravo.

- Update to 1.4.8:
  * API:
    + QueryParser,TermGenerator: Add new stemming mode STEM_SOME_FULL_POS.
      This stores positional information for both stemmed and unstemmed terms,
      allowing NEAR and ADJ to work with stemmed terms.  The extra positional
      information is likely to take up a significant amount of extra disk space so
      the default STEM_SOME is likely to be a better choice for most users.
    + Database::check(): Fetch and decompress the document data to catch problems
      with the splitting of large data into multiple entries, corruption of the
      compressed data, etc.  Also check that empty document data isn't explicitly
      stored for glass.
    + Fix an incorrect type being used for term positions in the TermGenerator API.
      These were Xapian::termcount but should be Xapian::termpos.  Both are
      typedefs for the same 32-bit unsigned integer type by default (almost always
      "unsigned int") so this change is entirely compatible, except that if you
      were configuring 1.4.7 or earlier with --enable-64bit-termcount you need to
      also use the new --enable-64bit-termpos configure option with 1.4.8 and up or
      rebuild your applications.  This change was necessary to make
      --enable-64bit-termpos actually useful.
    + Add Document::remove_postings() method which removes all postings in a
      specified term position range much more efficiently than by calling
      remove_posting() repeatedly.  It returns the number of postings removed.
    + Fix bugs with handling term positions >= 0x80000000.  Reported by Gaurav
      Arora.
    + Document::add_posting(): More efficiently handle insertion of a batch of
      extra positions in ascending order.
    + Query: Simplify OP_SYNONYM with single OP_WILDCARD subquery by converting to
      OP_WILDCARD with combiner OP_SYNONYM, which means such cases can take
      advantage of the new matcher optimisation in this release to avoid needing
      document length for OP_WILDCARD with combiner OP_SYNONYM.
  * testsuite:
    + Catch and report std::exception from the test harness itself.
    + apitest: Drop special case for not storing doc length in testcase postlist5 -
      all backends have stored document lengths for a long time.
    + test_harness: Create directories in a race-free way.
  * matcher:
    + Avoid needing document length for an OP_WILDCARD with combiner OP_SYNONYM.
      We know that we can't get any duplicate terms in the expansion of a wildcard
      so the sum of the wdf from them can't possibly exceed the document length.
    + OP_SYNONYM: No longer tries to initialise weights for its subquery, which
      should reduce the time taken to set up a large wildcard query.
    + OP_SYNONYM: Fix frequency estimates when OP_SYNONYM is used with a
      subquery containing OP_XOR or OP_MAX - in such cases the frequency
      estimates for the first subquery of the OP_XOR/OP_MAX were used for
      all its subqueries.  Also the estimated collection frequency is
      now rounded to the nearest integer rather than always being rounded
      down.
  * glass backend:
    + Revert change made in 1.4.6:
        Enable glass's "open_nearby_postlist" optimisation (which especially helps
        large wildcard queries) for writable databases without any uncommitted
        changes as well.
      The amended check isn't conservative enough as there may be postlist changes
      in the inverter while the table is unmodified.  This breaks testcase
      T150-tagging.sh in notmuch's testsuite, reported by David Bremner.
    + When indexing a document without any terms we now avoid some unnecessary work
      when storing its termlist.
  * build system:
    + New --enable-64bit-termpos configure option which makes Xapian::termpos a
      64-bit type and enables support for storing 64-bit termpos values in the
      glass backend in an upwardly compatible way.  Few people will actually want
      to index documents more than 4 billion words long, but the extra numbering
      space can be helpful if you want to use term positions in "interesting" ways.
    + Hook up configure --disable-sse/--enable-sse=sse options for MSVC.
    + Fix configure probes for builtin functions for clang.  We need to specify the
      argument types for each builtin since otherwise AC_CHECK_DECLS tries to
      compile code which just tries to take a pointer to the builtin function
      causing clang to give an error saying that's not allowed.  If the argument
      types are specified then AC_CHECK_DECLS tries to compile a call to the
      builtin function instead.
  * documentation:
    + Fix documentation comment typo.
  * tools:
    + xapian-delve: Test for all docs empty using get_total_length() which is
      slightly simpler internally than get_avlength(), and avoids an exact floating
      point equality check.
  * examples:
    + quest: Support --weight=coord.
    + xapian-pos: New tool to show term position info to help debugging when using
      positional information in more complex ways.
  * portability:
    + Fix undefined behaviour from C++ ODR violation due to using the same name
      two different non-static inline functions.  It seems that with current GCC
      versions the desired function always ends up being used, but with current
      clang the other function is sometimes used, resulting in database corruption
      when using value slots in docid 16384 or higher with the default glass
      backend.  Patch from Germán M. Bravo.
    + Suppress alignment cast warning on sparc Linux.  The pointer being cast is to
      a record returned by getdirentries(), so it should be suitable aligned.
    + Drop special handling for Compaq C++.  We never actually achieved a working
      build using it, and I can find no evidence that this compiler still exists,
      let alone that it was updated for C++11 which we now require.
    + Create new database directories in race-free way.
    + Avoid throwing and handling an exception in replace_document() when
      adding a document with a specified docid which is <= last_docid but currently
      unused.
    + Use our portable code for handling UUIDs on all platforms, and only use
      platform-specific code for generating a new UUID.  This fixes a bug with
      converting UUIDs to and from string representation on FreeBSD, NetBSD and
      OpenBSD on little-endian platforms which resulted in reversed byte order in
      the first three components, so the same database would report a different
      UUID on these platforms compared to other platforms.  With this fix, the
      UUIDs of existing databases will appear to change on these platforms
      (except in rare "palindronic" cases).  Reported by Germán M. Bravo.
    + Fix to build with a C++17 compiler.  Previously we used a "byte" type
      internally which clashed with "std::byte" in source files which use
      "using namespace std;".  Fixes #768, reported by Laurent Stacul.
    + Adjust apitest testcase stubdb2 to allow for NetBSD oddity: NetBSD's
      getaddrinfo() in IPv4 mode seems to resolve ::1 to an IPv4 address on the
      local network.
    + Avoid timer_create() on OpenBSD and NetBSD.  On OpenBSD it always fails with
      ENOSYS (and there's no prototype in the libc headers), while on NetBSD it
      seems to work, but the timer never seems to fire, so it's useless to us (see
      #770).
    + Use SOCK_NONBLOCK if available to avoid a call to fcntl().  It's supported by
      at least Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
    + Use O_NOINHERIT for O_CLOEXEC on Windows.  This flag has essentially the same
      effect, and it's common in other codebases to do this.
    + On AIX O_CLOEXEC may be a 64-bit constant which won't fit in an int.  To
      workaround this stupidity we now call the non-standard open64x() instead
      of open() when the flags don't fit in an int.
    + Add functions to add/multiply with overflow check.  These are implemented
      with compiler builtins or equivalent where possible, so the overflow check
      will typically just require a check of the processor's overflow or carry
      flag.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 24 05:42:05 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to 1.4.7:
  * API:
    + Database::check(): Fix bogus error reports for documents with length
      zero due to a new check added in 1.4.6 that the doclength was between the
      stored upper and lower bounds, which failed to allow for the lower bound
      ignoring documents with length zero (since documents indexed only by
      boolean terms aren't involved in weighted searches).

    + Query: Use of Query::MatchAll in multithreaded code causes problems
      because the reference counting gets messed up by concurrent updates.
      Document that Query(string()) should be used instead of MatchAll in
      multithreaded code, and avoid using it in library code.

  * Stem:
    + Stemming algorithms added for Irish, Lithuanian, Nepali and Tamil.
    + Merge Snowball compiler changes which improve code generation.
    + Merge optimisations to the Arabic and Turkish stemmers.

  * testsuite:
    + Fix duplicate test in apitest closedb10 testcase.

  * See also https://xapian.org/docs/xapian-core-1.4.7/NEWS

- Fix RPM groups.
- Trim bias and redundancies from description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  3 09:21:00 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.6:
  * API classes now support C++11 move semantics when using a compiler which
    we are confident supports them (currently compilers which define
    __cplusplus >= 201103 plus a special check for MSVC 2015 or later).
    C++11 move semantics provide a clean and efficient way for threaded code to
    hand-off Xapian objects to worker threads, but in this case it's very
    unhelpful for availability of these semantics to vary by compiler as it
    quietly leads to a build with non-threadsafe behaviour.  To address this,
    user code can #define XAPIAN_MOVE_SEMANTICS before #include <xapian.h> to
    force this on, and will then get a compilation failure if the compiler
    lacks suitable support.

  * MSet::snippet():
    + We were only escaping output for HTML/XML in some cases, which would
      potentially allow HTML to be injected into output (this fixes
      bnc#1099925, CVE-2018-0499).
    + Include certain leading non-word characters in snippets.  Previously we
      started the snippet at the start of the first actual word, but there are
      various cases where including non-word characters in front of the actual
      word adds useful context or otherwise aids comprehension.

  * Add MSetIterator::get_sort_key() method.  The sort key has always been
    available internally, but wasn't exposed via the public API before, which
    seems like an oversight as the collapse key has long been available.

  * Database::compact():
    + Allow Compactor::resolve_duplicate_metadata() implementations to delete
      entries.  Previously if an implementation returned an empty string this
      would result in a user meta-data entry with an empty value, which isn't
      normally achievable (empty meta-data values aren't stored), and so will
      cause odd behaviour.  We now handle an empty returned value by
      interpreting it in the natural way - it means that the merged result is
      to not set a value for that key in the output database.
    + Since 1.3.5 compacting a WritableDatabase with uncommitted changes throws
      Xapian::InvalidOperationError when compacting to a single-file glass
      database.  This release adds similar checks for chert and when compacting
      to a multiple-file glass database.
    + In the unlikely event that the total number of documents or the total
      length of all documents overflow when trying to compact a multi-database,
      we throw an exception.  This is now a DatabaseError exception instead of a
      const char* exception (a hang-over from before this code was turned into a
      public API in the library).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 10:43:38 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.5:
  * Add Database::get_total_length() method.  Previously you had to calculate
    this from get_avlength() and get_doccount(), taking into account rounding
    issues.  But even then you couldn't reliably get the exact value when total
    length is large since a double's mantissa has more limited precision than an
    unsigned long long.
  * Add Xapian::iterator_rewound() for bidirectional iterators, to test if the
    iterator is at the start (useful for testing whether we're done when
    iterating backwards).
  * DatabaseOpeningError exceptions now provide errno via get_error_string()
    rather than turning it into a string and including it in the exception
    message.
  * WritableDatabase::replace_document(): when passed a Document object which
    came from a database and has unmodified values, we used to always read
    those values into a memory structure.  Now we only do this if the document
    is being replaced to the same document ID which it came from, which should
    make other cases a bit more efficient.
  * Enquire::get_eset(): When approximating term frequencies we now round to the
    nearest integer - previously we always rounded down.
  * See also https://xapian.org/docs/xapian-core-1.4.5/NEWS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 30 15:46:49 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.4:
 * Database::check():
   + Fix checking a single table - changes in 1.4.2 broke such checks unless
     you specified the table without any extension.
   + Errors from failing to find the file specified are now thrown as
     DatabaseOpeningError (was DatabaseError, of which DatabaseOpeningError is
     a subclass so existing code should continue to work).  Also improved the
     error message when the file doesn't exist is better.
  * Drop OP_SCALE_WEIGHT over OP_VALUE_RANGE, OP_VALUE_GE and OP_VALUE_LE in
    the Query constructor.  These operators always return weight 0 so
    OP_SCALE_WEIGHT over them has no effect.  Eliminating it at query
    construction time is cheap (we only need to check the type of the
    subquery), eliminates the confusing "0 * " from the query description,
    and means the OP_SCALE_WEIGHT Query object can be released sooner.
    Inspired by Shivanshu Chauhan asking about the query description on IRC.
  * Drop OP_SCALE_WEIGHT on the right side of OP_AND_NOT in the Query
    constructor.  OP_AND_NOT takes no weight from the right so OP_SCALE_WEIGHT
    has no effect there.  Eliminating it at query construction time is cheap
    (just need to check the subquery's type), eliminates the confusing "0 * "
    from the query description, and means the OP_SCALE_WEIGHT object can be
    released sooner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 09:40:00 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.3:
 * MSet::snippet(): Favour candidate snippets which contain more of a diversity
   of matching terms by discounting the relevance of repeated terms using an
   exponential decay.  A snippet which contains more terms from the query is
   likely to be better than one which contains the same term or terms multiple
   times, but a repeated term is still interesting, just less with each
   additional appearance.  Diversity issue highlighted by Robert Stepanek's
   patch in https://github.com/xapian/xapian/pull/117 - testcases taken from his
   patch.

 * MSet::snippet(): New flag SNIPPET_EMPTY_WITHOUT_MATCH to get an empty snippet
   if there are no matches in the text passed in.  Implemented by Robert
   Stepanek.

 * Round MSet::get_matches_estimated() to an appropriate number of significant
   figures.  The algorithm used looks at the lower and upper bound and where the
   estimate sits between them, and then picks an appropriate number of
   significant figures.  Thanks to Sébastien Le Callonnec for help sorting out a
   portability issue on OS X.

 * Add Database::locked() method - where possible this non-invasively checks if
   the database is currently open for writing, which can be useful for
   dashboards and other status reporting tools.

 * See also https://xapian.org/docs/xapian-core-1.4.3/NEWS

- Update to 1.4.2:
 * Add XAPIAN_AT_LEAST(A,B,C) macro.
 
 * MSet::snippet(): Optimise snippet generation - it's now ~46% faster in a
   simple test.
 
 * Add Xapian::DOC_ASSUME_VALID flag which tells Database::get_document() that
   it doesn't need to check that the passed docid is valid.  Fixes #739,
   reported by Germán M. Bravo.

 * TfIdfWeight: Add support for the L wdf normalisation.  Patch from Vivek Pal.

 *  BB2Weight: Fix weights when database has just one document.  Our existing
   attempt to clamp N to be at least 2 was ineffective due to computing
   N - 2 < 0 in an unsigned type.

 * DPHWeight: Fix reversed sign in quadratic formula, making the upper bound a
   tiny amount higher.

 * DLHWeight: Correct upper bound which was a bit too low, due to flawed logic
   in its derivation.  The new bound is slightly less tight (by a few percent).

 * DLHWeight,DPHWeight: Avoid calculating log(0) when wdf is equal to the
   document length.

 * TermGenerator: Handle stemmer returning empty string - the Arabic stemmer
   can currently do this (e.g. for a single tatweel) and user stemmers can too.
   Fixes #741, reported by Emmanuel Engelhart.

 * Database::check(): Fix check that the first docid in each doclength chunk is
   more than the last docid in the previous chunk - this code was in the wrong
   place so didn't actually work.

 * Database::get_unique_terms(): Clamp returned value to be <= document length.
   Ideally get_unique_terms() ought to only count terms with wdf > 0, but that's
   expensive to calculate on demand.

 * See also https://xapian.org/docs/xapian-core-1.4.2/NEWS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 11 10:02:34 UTC 2016 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to 1.4.1 
 * Constructing a Query for a non-reference counted PostingSource object will
   now try to clone the PostingSource object (as happened in 1.3.4 and
   earlier).  This clone code was removed as part of the changes in 1.3.5 to
   support optional reference counting of PostingSource objects, but that breaks
   the case when the PostingSource object is on the stack and goes out of scope
   before the Query object is used.  Issue reported by Till Schäfer and analysed
   by Daniel Vrátil in a bug report against Akonadi:
   https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363741
 
 * Add BM25PlusWeight class implementing the BM25+ weighting scheme, implemented
   by Vivek Pal (https://github.com/xapian/xapian/pull/104).

 * Add PL2PlusWeight class implementing the PL2+ weighting scheme, implemented
   by Vivek Pal (https://github.com/xapian/xapian/pull/108).

 * LMWeight: Implement Dir+ weighting scheme as DIRICHLET_PLUS_SMOOTHING.
   Patch from Vivek Pal.

 * Add CoordWeight class implementing coordinate matching.  This can be useful
   for specialised uses - e.g. to implement sorting by the number of matching
   filters.

 * DLHWeight,DPHWeight,PL2Weight: With these weighting schemes, the formulae
   can give a negative weight contribution for a term in extreme cases.  We
   used to try to handle this by calculating a per-term lower bound on the
   contribution and subtracting this from the contribution, but this idea
   is fundamentally flawed as the total offset it adds to a document depends on
   what combination of terms that document matches, meaning in general the
   offset isn't the same for every matching document.  So instead we now clamp
   each term's weight contribution to be >= 0.

 * TfIdfWeight: Always scale term weight by wqf - this seems the logical
   approach as it matches the weighting we'd get if we weighted every non-unique
   term in the query, as well as being explicit in the Piv+ formula.

 * Fix OP_SCALE_WEIGHT to work with all weighting schemes - previously it was
   ignored when using PL2Weight and LMWeight.

 * PL2Weight: Greatly improve upper bound on weight:
   + Split the weight equation into two parts and maximise each separately as
     that gives an easily solvable problem, and in common cases the maximum is
     at the same value of wdfn for both parts.  In a simple test, the upper
     bounds are now just over double the highest weight actually achieved -
     previously they were several hundred times.  This approach was suggested by
     Aarsh Shah in: https://github.com/xapian/xapian/pull/48
   + Improve upper bound on normalised wdf (wdfn) - when wdf_upper_bound >
     doclength_lower_bound, we get a tighter bound by evaluating at
     wdf=wdf_upper_bound.  In a simple test, this reduces the upper bound on
     wdfn by 36-64%, and the upper bound on the weight by 9-33%.

 * PL2Weight: Fix calculation of upper_bound when P2>0.  P2 is typically
   negative, but for a very common term it can be positive and then we should
   use wdfn_lower not wdfn_upper to adjust P_max.

 * Weight::unserialise(): Check serialised form is empty when unserialising
   parameter-free schemes BoolWeight, DLHWeight and DPHWeight.

 * TermGenerator::set_stopper_strategy(): New method to control how the Stopper
   object is used.  Patch from Arnav Jain.

 * QueryParser: Fix handling of CJK query over multiple prefixes.  Previously
   all the n-gram terms were AND-ed together - now we AND together for each
   prefix, then OR the results.  Fixes #719, reported by Aaron Li.
 
 * Add Database::get_revision() method which provides access to the database
   revision number for chert and glass, intended for use by xapiand.  Marked
   as experimental, so we don't have to go through the usual deprecation cycle
   if this proves not to be the approach we want to take.  Fixes #709,
   reported by German M. Bravo.

 * Mark RangeProcessor constructor as `explicit`.

- Update to 1.2.21
  * API:
    + QueryParser: Extend the set of characters allowed in the 
      start of a range to be anything except for '(' and characters <= ' '.  

  * matcher:
    + Reimplement OP_PHRASE for non-exact phrases.  
    + Reimplement OP_NEAR - the new implementation consistently 
      requires the terms to occur at different positions, and fixes 
      some previously missed matches.
    + Fix a reversed check for picking the shorter position list 
      for an exact phrase of two terms.
    + When matching an exact phrase, if a term doesn't occur where 
      we want, use its actual position to advance the anchor term, 
      rather than just checking the next position of the anchor term.

  * brass backend:
    + Fix cursor versioning to consider cancel() and reopen() as 
      events where the cursor version may need incrementing, 
      and flag the current cursor version as used when a cursor is rebuilt.
    + Avoid using file descriptions < 3 for writable database tables, 
      as it risks corruption if some code in the same process tries 
      to write to stdout or stderr without realising it is closed.

  * chert backend:
    + Fix cursor versioning to consider cancel() and reopen() as 
      events where the cursor version may need incrementing, 
      and flag the current cursor version as used when a cursor is rebuilt.
    + Avoid using file descriptions < 3 for writable database tables, 
      as it risks corruption if some code in the same process tries 
      to write to stdout or stderr without realising it is closed.

  * flint backend:
    + Fix cursor versioning to consider cancel() and reopen() as 
      events where the cursor version may need incrementing, 
      and flag the current cursor version as used when a cursor is rebuilt.


  * remote backend:

    + Fix sort by value when multiple databases are in use and one or 
      more are remote. 

  * build system:

    + The compiler ABI check in the public API headers now issues a 
      warning (instead of an error) for an ABI mismatch for ABI versions 
      2 and later (which means GCC >= 3.4). 
    + xapian-config,xapian-core.pc: When compiling with xlC on AIX, the 
      reported --cxxflags/--cflags now include -D_LARGE_FILES=1 as this 
      is defined for the library, and defining it changes the ABI of 
      std::string with this compiler, so it must also be defined when 
      building code using the Xapian API.
    + xapian-core.pc: Include --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc in --libs 
      output for mingw and cygwin, like xapian-config does.
    + xapian-core.pc: Fix include directory reported by `pkg-config --cflags`.
    + xapian-config: Fix typo so cached result of test in is_uninstalled() 
      is actually used on subsequent calls.  
    + configure: Changes in 1.2.19 broke the custom macro we use to probe 
      for supported compiler flags such that the flags never got used.
    + configure: Set default value for AUTOM4TE before AC_OUTPUT so the 
      default will actually get used.  
    + soaktest: Link with libtool's '-no-install' or '-no-fast-install', 
      like we already do for other test programs, which means that libtool 
      doesn't need to generate shell script wrappers for them on most platforms.

  * documentation:
    + API documentation: Minor wording tweaks and formatting improvements.
    + docs/deprecation.rst: Add deprecation of omindex --preserve-nonduplicates
      which happened in 1.2.4.
    + HACKING: libtool 2.4.6 is now used for bootstrapping snapshots and releases.

  * tools:
    + xapian-compact: Make sure we open all the tables of input databases at the
      same revision.
    + xapian-metadata: Add 'list' subcommand to list all the metadata keys.
    + xapian-replicate: Fix connection timeout to be 10 seconds rather than 10000
      seconds (the incorrect timeout has been the case since 1.2.3).
    + xapian-replicate: Set SO_KEEPALIVE for xapian-replicate's connection to the
      master, and add command line option to allow setting socket-level timeouts
      (SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO) on platforms that support them.
    + xapian-replicate-server: Avoid potentially reading uninitialised data if a
      changeset file is truncated.

  * portability:
    + Add spaces between literal strings and macros which expand to literal strings
      for C++11 compatibility.
    + ValueCountMatchSpy::top_values_begin(): Fix the comparison function not to
      return true for two equal elements, which manifests as incorrect sorting in
      some cases when using clang's libc++ (which recent OS X versions do).
    + apitest: The adddoc5 testcase fails under clang due to an exception handling
      bug, so just #ifdef out the problematic part of the testcase when building
      with clang for now.
    + configure: Improve the probe for whether the test harness can use RTTI to
      work for IBM's xlC compiler (which defaults to not generating RTTI).
    + Use F_DUPFD where available to dup to a file descriptor which is >= 2, rather
      than calling dup() until we get one.
    + When unserialising a double, avoid reading one byte past the end of the
      serialised value.
    + When unserialising a double, add missing cast to unsigned char when we check
      if the value will fit in the double type.
    + Fix incorrect use of "delete" which should be "delete []".  This is
      undefined behaviour in C++, though the type is POD, so in practice this
      probably worked OK on many platforms.

- Drop patch 0001-backends-chert-chert_cursor.cc-backends-chert-chert_.patch
  due to upstream inclusion

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  2 01:27:33 UTC 2015 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Add 0001-backends-chert-chert_cursor.cc-backends-chert-chert_.patch
  from upstream (kde#341990, http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/675)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 07:34:11 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.2.20
  * chert backend
    + After splitting a block, we always insert the new block in 
      the parent right after the block it was split from - there's 
      no need to binary chop.
  * build system
    + Generate and install a file for pkg-config.
    + configure: Update link to cygwin FAQ in error message.
  * tools
    + xapian-check: For chert and brass, cross-check the position 
      and postlist tables to detect positional data for non-existent 
      documents.
  * portability
    + When locking a database for writing, use F_OFD_SETLK where 
      available, which avoids having to fork() a child process to 
      hold the lock.  This currently requires Linux kernel >= 3.15, 
      but it has been submitted to POSIX so hopefully will be widely 
      supported eventually.  Thanks to Austin Clements for pointing 
      out this now exists.
    + Fix detection of fdatasync(), which appears to have been 
      broken practically forever - this means we've probably been 
      using fsync() instead, which probably isn't a big additional 
      overhead.  Thanks to Vlad Shablinsky for helping with Mac 
      OS X portability of this fix.
    + configure: Define MINGW_HAS_SECURE_API under mingw to get 
      _putenv_s() declared in stdlib.h.
    + Use POSIX O_NONBLOCK in preference to O_NDELAY - the 
      semantics of the latter differ between BSD and System V.
    + According to POSIX, strerror() may not be thread safe, so 
      use alternative thread-safe ways to translate errno values 
      where possible.
    + On Microsoft Windows, avoid defining EADDRINUSE, etc if 
      they're already defined, and use WSAE* constants un-negated - 
      they start from a high value so won't collide with E* 
      constants.

Tue Oct 21 12:18:41 UTC 2014 - tittiatcoke@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2.19
  - API:
    * Xapian::BM5Weight:
      + Improve BM25 upper bound in the case when our wdf upper 
        bound > our document length lower bound.
      + Pre-multiply termweight by (param_k1 + 1) rather than 
        doing it for every weighted term in every document considered.
  - testsuite:
    * Don't report apparent leaks of fds opened on /dev/urandom 
  - matcher:
    * Fix false matches reported for non-exact phrases in some cases.
  - build system:
    * For Sun's C++ compiler, pass -library=Crun separately since 
      libtool looks for " -library=stlport4 " (with the spaces).
    * Remove .replicatmp (created by the test suite) upon "make clean".
  - documentation:
    * include/xapian/compactor.h: Fix formatting of doxygen comment.
    * HACKING: freecode no longer accepts updates, so drop that item 
      from the release checklist.
    * docs/overview.rst: Add missing database path to example of using
      xapian-progsrv in a stub database file.
  - portability:
    * Suppress unused typedef warnings from debugging logging macros, 
      which occur in functions which always exit via throwing an 
      exception when compiling with recent versions of GCC or clang.
    * Fix debug logging code to compile with clang.

Wed Jan 29 22:10:21 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2.17
 - API:
  * Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance_then_value() and 
    Enquire::set_sort_by_relevance_then_key(): Fix sense of reverse 
    parameter.
  * BM25Weight: Fix case where (k1 == 0 || b == 0) but k2 != 0.
  * Unicode::tolower(): Fix to give correct results for U+01C5, 
    U+01C8, U+01CB, and U+01F2
 - testsuite:
  * Automatically probe for and hook in eatmydata to the testsuite 
    using the wrapper script it now includes.
  * Fix apitest to build when brass, chert or flint are disabled.
 - brass backend:
  * Fix handling of invalid block sizes passed to Xapian::Brass::open() 
    - the size gets fixed as documented, but the uncorrected size 
    was passed to the base file (and abort() was called if 0 
    was passed).
  * Validate "dir_end" when reading a block.  (fixes #592)
 - chert backend:
  * Fix handling of invalid block sizes passed to Xapian::Chert::open() 
    - the size gets fixed as documented, but the uncorrected size was 
    passed to the base file (and abort() was called if 0 was passed).
  * Validate "dir_end" when reading a block.  (fixes #592)
 - flint backend:
  * Fix handling of invalid block sizes passed to Xapian::Flint::open() 
    - the size gets fixed as documented, but the uncorrected size was 
    passed to the base file (and abort() was called if 0 was passed).
  * Validate "dir_end" when reading a block.  (fixes #592)
 - build system:
  * configure: Improve reporting of GCC version.
  * Use -no-fast-install on platforms where -no-install causes 
    libtool to emit a warning.
  * docs/Makefile.am: Fix handling of MAINTAINER_NO_DOCS.
  * Include UnicodeData.txt and the script to generate the unicode 
    tables from it.
 - documentation:
  * postingsource.rst: Clarify a couple of points
 - portability:
  * Protect the ValueIterator::check() method against Mac OS X SDK 
    headers which define a check() macro.
  * Fix warning from xlC compiler.
  * Avoid use of grep -e in configure, as /usr/bin/grep on Solaris 
    doesn't support -e.
  * Fix check for flags which might be needed for ANSI mode for 
    compilers called 'cxx'.
  * configure: Improve handling of Sun's C++ compiler - trick libtool 
    into not adding -library=Cstd, and prefer -library=stdcxx4 if 
    supported.  Explicitly add -library=Crun which seems to be required, 
    even though the documentation suggests otherwise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 15 20:24:21 UTC 2013 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2.16
 - API:
  * PositionIterator,PostingIterator,TermIterator,ValueIterator:
    Don't segfault if skip_to() or check() is called on an iterator
    which is already at_end().
  * ValueCountMatchSpy: get_description() on a default-constructed
    ValueCountMatchSpy object no longer fails when xapian-core is
    built with --enable-log.
  * ValueCountMatchSpy: get_total() on a default-constructed
    ValueCountMatchSpy object now returns 0 rather than segfaulting.
 - brass backend:
  * When moving a cursor on a read-only table, check if the block we
    want is in the internal cursor.  We already do this for a
    writable table, as it is necessary for correctness, but it's a
    cheap check and may avoid asking the OS for a block we actually
    already have.
  * Correctly report the database as closed rather than
    'Bad file descriptor' in certain cases.
  * Reuse a cursor for reading values from valuestreams rather than
    creating a new one each time.  This can dramatically reduce the
    number of blocks redundantly reread when sorting by value.
    The rereads will generally get served from VM cache, but there's
    still an overhead to that.
 - chert backend:

  * Correctly report the database as closed rather than
    'Bad file descriptor' in certain cases.
 - tools:
  * xapian-chert-update: Fix -b to work rather than always
    segfaulting (reported in http://bugs.debian.org/716484).
  * xapian-chert-update: The documented alias --blocksize for -b has
    never actually been supported, so just drop mentions of it
    from --help and the man page.
 - xapian-check:
  * Fix chert database check that first docid in each doclength
    chunk is more than the last docid in the previous chunk
    - previously this didn't actually work.
  * Fix database check not to falsely report "position table: Junk
    after position data" whenever there are 7 unused bits (7 is OK,
    *more* than 7 isn't).
  * Fix to report block numbers correctly for links within the B-tree.
  * If the METAINFO key is missing, only report it once per table.
  * Fix database consistency checking to always open all the tables
    at the same revision - not doing this could lead to false errors
    being reported after a commit interrupted by the process being
    killed or the machine crashing.
- Change tarball to xz. Added xz BuildRequires: xz for that purpose

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 21 10:22:07 UTC 2012 - mlin@suse.com

- Update to version 1.2.12
  * 1.2.11 had its library version information incorrectly set.
    This resulted in the shared library having an incorrect SONAME.
    This release has been made to fix this problem.
  * Fix issue with running AND, OR and XOR queries against a
    database with no documents in it - this was leading to a divide
    by zero, which led to MSet::get_matches_estimated() reporting
    2147483648 on i386.
  * Don't count unweighted subqueries of MultiAndPostList in
    percentage calculations, as OP_FILTER maps to MultiAndPostList
    now.  (ticket#590)
  * When compacting, if the output database is empty, don't write
    out a metainfo tag.  Take care not to divide by zero when
    computing the percentage size change for a table.
    (brass and chert backend)
  * Add new QueryParser::STEM_ALL_Z stemming strategy, which
    stems all terms and adds a Z prefix.
  * Add TermGenerator::set_stemming_strategy() method, with
    strategies which correspond to those of QueryParser.
  * Correct "BM25Weight" to "TradWeight" in exception message
    from TradWeight.
  * We were failing to call init() for user-defined Weight objects
    providing the term-independent weight.  These now get called
    with init(0.0).
  * Xapian::Auto::open_stub() now throws a Xapian::DatabaseOpeningError
    exception if the stub file can't be opened.  Previously we
    failed to check for this condition, which resulted in us
    treating the file as empty.

Thu Dec 29 11:31:53 CET 2011 - dmueller@suse.de

- update to 1.2.8:
  * Add support to TermGenerator and QueryParser for indexing and searching CJK
  text using n-grams.  Currently this is only enabled when the environmental
  variable XAPIAN_CJK_NGRAM is set to a non-empty value.
  * overview.html,quickstart.html: Fix several factual errors.
  * Improve documentation comments for several methods.
  * Add documentation for function parameters which didn't have it.
