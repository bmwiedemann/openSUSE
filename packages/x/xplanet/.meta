  <title>Planets as Background Pictures or Interactive Animations</title>
  <description>Xplanet can display the earth or other planets in the background of
your display, similar to xearth or xglobe.  Additionally, it can run in
interactive mode allowing you to rotate or zoom the planet.  Also, with
an included script, it is very easy to combine map files with current
satellite cloud images. See
/usr/share/doc/packages/xplanet/README.SuSE.  For screenshots and more
interesting information, have a look at the Xplanet home page:
