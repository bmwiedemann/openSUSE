  <title>Some cockroaches on your root window</title>
  <description>Xroach displays disgusting cockroaches on your root window. These
creepy crawlies scamper around until they find a window to hide under.
Whenever you move or iconify a window, the exposed orthopteras again
scamper for cover.</description>
