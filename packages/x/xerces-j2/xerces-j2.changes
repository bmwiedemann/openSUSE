- Update to 2.12.2 [bsc#1195108, CVE-2022-23437]:
  * This release is a bug fix release. It fixes few bugs which were 
    present in Xerces-J 2.12.1 and also includes a few other minor 
    enhancements.
    + Implemented a fix, that solves rarely occurring XML parsing 
      performance issue.
    + Improved compliance, of XPath 2.0 processor's regex 
      implementation (that's used within XML Schema 1.1 
      implementation).
    + XML Schema validation error message improvements, when XML 
      attributes are validated.
    + Improved the JAXP SourceValidator sample, related to XML 
      Schema 1.1 assertion evaluations on list types.	
    + Solved an XML Schema implementation issue, where 
      combination of restrictions 'length' and 'minLength' was
      leading to error.
    + Made minor, improvements to few XML Schema 1.1 validation 
      error messages.
    + Fixed a rarely occurring issue during XML Schema 1.1 
      xs:assert evaluation, where adjacent text values within
      XML instance document, were resulting in more than one
      adjacent XPath 2.0 text nodes.
    + Upgraded the minimum, Java requirement to use XercesJ to
      Java version 1.7.
    + Upgraded XalanJ serializer dependency to version 2.7.2
      from 2.7.1, which is required by XercesJ.
    + Re-built, "XML Commons External" and "XML Commons 
      Resolver" codebases (which are dependencies for XercesJ) 
      using Java 1.7.

- Removed patch xerces-2_11_0-jdk7.patch:
  * this patch is already applied upstream
- Upgrade to upstream 2.12.1:
  * This release is a bug fix release. It fixes few bugs which were
  present in Xerces-J 2.12.0 and also includes a few other minor 
  enhancements.
    + Implemented few fixes for XML Schema identity constraints, 
      within Xerces's XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1 validators. 
    + When XML Schema 1.1 validations are done, where xs:assert 
      are contained within xs:override, the XPath expressions 
      within xs:assert can't see XML namespace bindings specified
      at certain locations in schema documents.
    + When XML Schema 1.1 validations are done, when the schema
      document is specified via xsi:schemaLocation attribute in 
      the XML document, when full XPath 2.0 is used with CTA, for
      certain use cases validation was not occurring correctly.
    + For certain cases, while doing XML Schema 1.1 xs:assert
      validations, error messages appeared like following 
      'FOAR0001 - Division by zero'. Modified such error messages,
      to now contain the character ':' instead of '-' (since, the
      character '-' can be confused with a negation symbol).	
    + The 'XML Schema 1.1 structures' REC in the section, "3.2.3
      Constraints on XML Representations of Attribute Declarations 
      (Schema Representation Constraint: Attribute Declaration 
      Representation)" mentions, '5 If fixed and use are both 
      present, use must not have the actual value prohibited'. 
      This functionality is newly introduced in XML Schema 1.1. 
      Fixed a runtime validation issue for this XSD clause, when
      XSD 1.1 implementation is invoked in XSD 1.0 mode.
    + Xerces-J was previously not building from sources when Java
      9+ was used.
    + XML Schema 1.1 has introduced the attribute 'ref' on xs:key,
      xs:unique and xs:keyref. When certain suchschema documents
      were processed by Xerces-J's XSD 1.1 implementation in XSD 
      1.0 mode, a java.lang.NullPointerException was displayed to
      the user when the schema document is processed with Xerces 
      sample jaxp.SourceValidator.
    + Fixed minor bugs and made various improvements.
    + Added many new tests to the regression since the previous
      Xerces release, for Xerces's XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1 
      implementations.

- Upgrade to version 2.12.0
  * This release expands on Xerces-J's experimental support for
    XML Schema 1.1 by providing a fully compliant XML Schema 1.1
    implementation. It fixes several bugs which were present in
    Xerces-J 2.11.0 and also includes a few other enhancements and
    performance improvements.
    + add: Report all id/idref problems when validating XML against
      DTD or XML Schema.
    + add: Implemented improvements to XML Schema 1.1 CTA
      implementation and inheritable attributes.
    + update: Implemented improved error/warning message reporting
      for various XML Schema use cases.
    + update: Implemented few performance enhancements (affecting
      parsing/validation latency and memory footprint) to the
      implementation.
    + fix: Fixed minor bugs in Xerces-J's regex support in XML
      Schema <pattern> facet.
    + fix: Implemented various fixes to XML Schema 1.1
      assert/assertion implementation.
    + fix: Fixed possible security issue: an implementation of the
      NamedNodeMapImpl class in the JAXP component did not limit the
      amount of memory allocated when creating object instance from
      a serialized form. A specially-crafted input could cause a
      java application to use an excessive amount of memory when
      deserialized.
    + fix: Implemented minor and major fixes in certain areas, to
      XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1 implementations.
    + fix: Fixed the issue related to, XIncludeTextReader doesn't
      handle null Content Types properly.
    + fix: Fixed minor problems in the DOM (Level 3 Core)
      implementation.
    + fix: Fixed few errors related to Xerces-J's build component.
    + fix: Solved a minor bug in SoftReferenceSymbolTable
      implementation component.
    + fix: Fixed various bugs and made various improvements.

- Version bump to 2.11.0:
  * This release expands on Xerces' experimental support for XML
    Schema 1.1 by providing implementations for the simplified
    complex type restriction rules (also known as subsumption),
    xs:override and a few other XML Schema 1.1 features. This
    release also introduces experimental support for XML Schema
    Component Designators (SCD). It fixes several bugs which were
    present in Xerces-J 2.10.0 and also includes a few other minor
    enhancements.
  * As of this release, Xerces and Xalan now share a common
    serialization codebase. The DOM Level 3 serialization support
    which was in Xerces was migrated into the Xalan serializer and
    Xerces' native serializer was deprecated. In this release we
    also upgraded the xml-commons resolver to v1.2 (which provides
    support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1), introduced a few minor
    features and fixed several bugs.
- Obsoleted patches no longer needed:
  * xerces-j2-parsing.patch
