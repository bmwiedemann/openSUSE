%description
The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic
desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux.

They are intended to provide a set of de-facto standards.
This means that:
 * Third party software developers can rely on these xdg-utils for
   all of their simple integration needs.

*  Developers of desktop environments can make sure that their
   environments are well supported.

   If a desktop developer wants to be certain that their
   environment functions with all third party software, then can
   simply make sure that these utilities work properly in their
   environment.
