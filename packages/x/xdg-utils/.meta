  <title>Utilities to uniformly interface desktop environments</title>
  <description>The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic
desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux.

They are intended to provide a set of defacto standards.  This means
   that: *  Third party software developers can rely on these
   xdg-utils for all of their simple integration needs.

*  Developers of desktop environments can make sure that their
   environments are well supported

If a desktop developer wants to be certain that their environment
functions with all third party software, then can simply make sure that
these utilities work properly in their environment.</description>
