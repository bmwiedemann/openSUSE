Tue Dec 13 08:23:42 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.16.0:
  + Introduce a new background monitoring service. This allows
    desktop environments to list applications that are running in
    background, that is, sandboxed applications running without a
    visible window. Desktop environments can display these
    background running applications in their interfaces, and allow
    users to control their execution.
  + Introduce the Global Shortcuts portal. This portal allows
    applications to register and receive keyboard shortcuts even
    when they're not focused. This was a highly requested feature,
    especially on Wayland desktops. There are improvements to come,
    but portal backends can now implement this new portal.
  + Various CI improvements.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 06:46:03 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.15.0:
  + Add Meson build files. For now, both Autotools and Meson are
    available in the source tree.
  + Make the Screenshot portal request permission to take
    screenshots. Frontends that implement the version 2 of
    org.freedesktop.portal.impl.Screenshot portal can now be aware
    that the screenshot permission was granted through the new
    'permission_store_checked' option, and skip any kind of dialog
    when that is the case.
  + Stop sending the app id quoted in the Background portal.
  + Fix a bug in cgroup name parsing.
  + Various fixes to the Realtime portal.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  code has been changed to call fusermount3 as  part of version
  1.14.0: document-portal: Move to the libfuse3 API (boo#1197567).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 19 09:41:29 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.14.1:
  + Fix an issue in 1.14.0 where xdg-desktop-portal.service
    starting before graphical-session-pre.target would cause the
    GNOME session to deadlock by moving code to a new libexec
    binary which handles deleting or migrating .desktop files (and
    icons) from the dynamic launcher portal for apps which have
    been uninstalled or renamed.
  + Fix some bugs in the aforementioned launcher migration
    implementation, "xdg-desktop-portal-rewrite-launchers".
  + Fix build without libsystemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 06:50:05 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.14.0:
  + Add a new "dynamic launcher" portal, which can install .desktop
    files and accompanying icons after user confirmation.
  + Rework handling of empty app IDs: In case an empty string app
    ID is stored in the permission store, this permission is now
    shared only by apps whose app ID couldn't be determined, rather
    than all unsandboxed apps.
  + Use libsystemd (when available) to try to determine the app ID
    of unsandboxed processes. This is useful since some portals
    otherwise can't be used by host apps.
  + Make x-d-p start on session start, which is needed for the
    dynamic launcher portal to handle rewriting launchers for apps
    that have been renamed.
  + Bring back the copy of Flatpak's icon-validator, which was
    dropped many releases ago.
  + Icon validation is now required for the notification and
    dynamic launcher portals (previously it was only done if the
    "flatpak-validate-icon" binary could be found).
  + document-portal: Move to the libfuse3 API
  + document-portal: Use renameat2 sys call
  + document-portal: Use mutex to fix concurrency bug
  + realtime: Fix error code paths
  + realtime: Fix MakeThreadHighPriorityWithPID method
  + screencast: Fix an error when restoring streams
  + ci: Various improvements
  + Documentation improvements
  + Updated translations.

  since document-portal moved to use it.
- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libsystemd) and
  pkgconfig(gdk-pixbuf-2.0) which are now used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 28 16:27:32 UTC 2020 - Dario Faggioli <dfaggioli@suse.com>

- Require /usr/bin/fusermount: xdg-document-portal calls out to the
  binary. Without it, files or dirs can be selected, but

- BuildIgnore xdg-desktop-portal: self-requires is not needed here
  to build. Flatkpak has a (correct) dependency on
  xdg-desktop-portal, but since we don't run flatpak during build,
  but merely require its -devel package, we can break up this
  chain.
