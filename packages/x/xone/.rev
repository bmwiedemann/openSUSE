    <comment>This package provides the Linux kernel driver for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S accessories.
it serves as a modern replacement for xpad, aiming to be
compatible with Microsoft's Game Input Protocol (GIP).

Now that xone-dongle-firmware is also in Factory, the driver can easily be installed and used on openSUSE :)</comment>
