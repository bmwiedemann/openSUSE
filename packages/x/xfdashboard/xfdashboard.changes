Tue Oct 27 20:48:49 UTC 2020 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.7.8
  * New feature: Support of more animations. So an actor can request
    an animation when a class or pseudo-class is added or was removed.
    Also an actor requests an animation when it was created and shown
    for the first time. Currently at last an animation is requested
    when the actor was moved and or resized.
  * Followed main Xfce project by switching to "foreign" mode
    at automake
  * Added dummy example search provider plugin. It's main purpose is
    to provide a skeleton for creating new search provider plugins.
  * Fixed a crash when reselecting a search result item on search
    update fails because its container was destroyed while updating.
  * Smaller bug fixes but mostly to silence compiler warnings
  * Translation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  3 11:06:11 UTC 2019 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.7.7
  * Fixes missing animations.xml file at all themes in tarball
    (bxo#16230, GH#184)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 29 13:23:00 UTC 2019 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.7.6
  * Raised minimum version of Glib to 2.38 for replacements
    of deprecated function g_type_class_add_private()
  * New feature: Support for animations. Currently only one actor
    (XfdashboardCollapseBox) trigger an animation signal to open
    or close the collapsed area. All default themes of xfdashboard
    will slide in or out the collapsed area smoothly when animation
    is enabled (which is enabled by default).
  * New feature: The user can turn on or off animations in the
    settings application.
  * Updated all GOject classes because of deprecation of function
    g_type_class_add_private()
  * Updated copyright years to 2019
  * Fix that valid desktop file for the same desktop ID but found
    at path of lower prioritory will override an invalid desktop
    file for the same desktop ID at path of higher priority. The
    first entry found - valid or invalid - will have the highest
    priority. Later all invalid desktop IDs in the application
    database are removed before populated. (GH#169)
  * Fixed warning "assertion 'GARCON_IS_MENU_DIRECTORY (other)'
    failed" when calling garcon_menu_directory_equal() in function
    _xfdashboard_applications_menu_model_find_similar_menu()
  * Fixed "implicit-fallthrough" compiler warnings in click action
  * Reduced number of release notes in AppData (GH#183)
  * Smaller bug fixes but mostly to silence compiler warnings
  * Updated translations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 16:43:56 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.5.1:
  * Implemented new experimental code to delay window content
    creation finally and made it configurable.
  * Implemented an application tracker which tries to determine and
    to keep track of running applications.
  * With the implementation of the application tracker also running
    application which are not stored as favourites in quicklaunch
    will be added dynamically as temporary application buttons
    which look the same as stored favourites one.
  * Favourite will get CSS class '.favourite-app' added to its
    actor while dynamically added non-favourite actors get the CSS
    class '.dynamic-app' added.
  * Hide all dynamically added non-favourite actors when a
    drag'n'drop action is in progress.
  * Partially rewrote build system to create a static library for
    all files except the main file containing the main() function.
  * Began adding gtk-doc documentation annotations to various files.
  * Remove calls to xfdashboard_actor_contains_child_deep() and
    replaced them with clutter_actor_contains()
  * Add command-line option "--view". This command-line option
    "--view [internal name of view]" allows to specify which view to
    show when xfdashboard gets visible. This will only be applied

    "gtk-tooltip-timeout" was requested as it is deprecated and
    ignored by GTK+ derived application since GTK+ 3.10 and higher.
  * Some other bug-fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 15:14:49 CEST 2015 - tiwai@suse.de

- include /usr/share/appdata to file list for fixing build on old
  distros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 13 09:49:59 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.5.0:
  * Added new experimental code to delay window content creation.
    It will make the application "feel" faster on machines with
    slow graphics card (e.g. slow texture creation or uploading).
    A resume queue was implemented which will create the window
    texture one after one when the application is idle. This should
    help not to block the application at start-up or when switching
    to workspaces with many windows resulting in a "feeling" that
    the application is faster and more responsive. To enable this
    experimental code the enviroment variable
    XFDASHBOARD_WINDOW_CONTENT_RESUME_ON_IDLE must be set to
    non-zero value when the application is started regardless
    if stand-alone or daemon mode.
  * New feature is a emblem effect called XfdashboardEmblemEffect.
    This new effect allows an icon to be drawn over an actor and
    can be added multiple times.
  * Improved tooltip to behave more the tooltip known of GTK+.
  * Improved search responsiveness by delaying initial search. But
    this delay is turned off by default so it behave like before.
    The delay can be configured in the settings. (GH #86)
  * XfdashboardLiveWindow will now reflect window state changes
    like urgent, minimized and pinned as CSS classes to get styles
    applied at one or more of this states.
  * The icon to show for an missing image can now be themed via the
    property 'missing-icon-name' at XfdashboardImageContent.
    It is not hard-coded to 'gtk-missing-image' anymore.
  * Implemented a new themable property 'show-window-content' at
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace to manage if a workspace actor (e.g.
    used in workspace selector) should show the window content of
    the windows at this workspace or to show the windows' icon
    instead. (GH #89)
  * Implemented also a new themable property 'background-image-type'
    at XfdashboardLiveWorkspace which behaves like the property
    'background-image-type' at XfdashboardStage(Interface). (GH #81)
  * Implemented a new property 'show-current-monitor-only' at
    XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector to limit the windows to show at
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace to the windows of the monitor where
    the selector is placed on. This feature can only be enabled in
    layout but not in CSS. All themes enable this feature. (GH #87)
  * Implemented a new signal 'window-monitor-changed' at window
    tracker to signal that a window has moved from one monitor to
    another. This signal is used by the windows view to determine
    if the moved window has to stay in this view or if another
    window view instance has to create an actor for this window and
    to handle it. (GH #88)
  * Do not track and handle window movements and resizes if the
    application is suspended. This should lower CPU usage while
    application is suspended and a window is moved or resized.
    (GH #44)
  * Reimplement old "hack" resize stage to screen size but this
    time also listen for screen size changes. This implementation
    is only needed when using Clutter version 1.17.1 or lower.
    It is checked at run-time if this "hack" is needed. (GH #95)
  * Changed method to find desktop window. This fixes problems
    finding desktop window in daemon mode (GH #80)
  * Show settings application menu entry also in other desktop
    environments than Xfce. (GH #78)
  * Fixed a bug that the windows view did not recognize that a
    window has move to the current active workspace when a
    workspace was removed and it did not show the moved window in
    view. (GH #91)
  * Fixed a bug that the functions to determine the preferred width
    and height in XfdashboardScaledTableLayout are called
    recursively and crashes the application
  * Fixed calculation of workspace selector's size by fraction or
    maximum size in multi-monitor setup by using size of
    XfdashboardStageInterface for calculation instead of stage's
    size which is the size of all monitors.
  * Fixed duplicate IDs in CSS selectors by throwing an error.
  * Lots of memleaks fixed.
  * Lots of other bug-fixes.
  * Lots of typos fixed.
  * Updated translations:
    + es (prflr88);
    + he (GenghisKhan);
    + it_IT (cri);
    + sr (salepetronije);
  * New translations:
    + fr (jc1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 31 12:53:45 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.4.2:
  * Fixed check against wrong major version of Clutter for old hack
    to resize stage to screen size. Also changed this check from
    compile-time to runtime.

    finding desktop window in daemon mode.

- Update to 0.3.91:
  * Fixed a bug that translations are not used in xfdashboard.
  * Fixed a visual bug in XfdashboardStageInterface which caused
    that clipping in XfdashboardViewpad did not work anymore and
    overlapped other actors.
  * Implemented a box layout manager called XfdashboardBoxLayout
    which is derived from ClutterBoxLayout and inherits all
    functions and properties. It only disregards text direction
    settings to enforce a horizontal left-to-right layout of its
    children always. (GH #66)
  * Fixed warning about using deprecated functions when compiling
    against GTK+ 3.14 or higher.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 19 17:32:30 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.3.90:
  * New feature: Implemented multi-monitor support. This also added
    a new interface ID "secondary" to themes which specifies how
    the stage for non-primary monitors looks like. (#14)
  * Added an option "/components/applications-view/show-all-apps"
    to settings which adds an "All applications" menu entry to
    applications view and shows all installed applications in this
    menu. It is disabled by default but configurable in settings.
  * Replaced GTK+ stock icons with named icons
  * Enforce X11 backend at Clutter to prevent start-up crashes when
    using Clutter 1.21.4 or higher which uses GDK backend by default.
    xfdashboard uses some X11 related function at Clutter (#73)
  * Clear startup-notification when application enters main loop
  * Fixed compiler warnings, build system and other smaller bug fixes
  * Updated translations: 
    + es (prflr88)
