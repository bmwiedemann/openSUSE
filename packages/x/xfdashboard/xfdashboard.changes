-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 23 16:49:22 UTC 2020 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.8.0
  * New application icon which follows rDNS naming
  * Implement pop-up menu which is currently only used by icons in
    quicklaunch when right-clicking at them.
  * The windows in windows view gained support to show also their
    child windows, e.g. open/save dialogs etc.
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#132)
  * All windows can now be drag'n'drop from any actor to any other
    window-related actor. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#79)
  * The window tracker and all other related classes are now
    interfaces to support multiple window systems, like X11, GDK and
    wayland. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#129)
  * Added a fine-grained controllable debug system.
  * At a theme's layout xml file you can now specify which actor of the
    focusable ones should be selected on theme load.
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#144)
  * New actions "selection-move-next", "selection-move-previous",
    "focus-move-first", "focus-move-last" and "focus-move-to" for use at
    custom key bindings were added. They are not bound at the default key
    bindings file installed. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#144,
    gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#145)
  * Window tracker interface now supports a new experimental
    backend for GDK. The backend to use can be controlled with the new
    environment variable XFDASHBOARD_BACKEND. It can be either set to
    "x11" or "gdk". (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#129)
  * Allow user to override CSS files of themes to apply user favourite
    settings. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#152)
  * Include new translations (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#155)
  * GDK backend is now optional and it will be enabled automatically
    if Clutter backend is available, i.e. FreeBSD does
    not install Clutter with GDK backend. (bxo#13766, bxo#13860)
  * Support also current xfconf versions (4.13.x). (bxo#13824)
  * Support for touch screen which supports "clicking" buttons
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#157)
  * Support of application actions defines at desktop entries which
    get listed in the pop-up menus of application buttons.
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#158, gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#160)
  * Support of "Keywords" of desktop entries which are taken into
    account when searching (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#159)
  * Support for animations. Currently only one actor trigger
    an animation signal to open or close the collapsed area.
  * The user can turn on or off animations in the settings application.
  * Support of more animations. So an actor can request an animation
    when a class or pseudo-class is added or was removed.
  * Support of animation if an actor is destroyed. It will be marked
    as destroyed by adding a CSS pseudo class "destroying".
    The actor will be destroyed finally when animation ends.
  * Introduced a new signal 'actor-created' emitted at stage where a
    newly created actor was placed on. Plugins can connect to this
    signal to detect new actors they are interested in and to modify
    them.
  * Introduced a new signal "initialized" in XfdashboardApplication
    which is emitted when primary instance is fully initialized, that
    means all managers and the stage were set up successfully.
  * New plugin 'middle-click-window-close' which allows the user
    to close windows in windows view with a middle click. This plugin
    is not configurable. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#128)
  * Added dummy example search provider plugin. It's main purpose is
    to provide a skeleton for creating new search provider plugins.
  * Changed loading key bindings to one-or-nothing to incremental
    loading. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#167)
  * Added '--version' command-line parameter to determine the version
    of xfdashboard running.
  * Followed main Xfce project by switching to "foreign" mode at automake
  * Added blue theme screenshot. (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#152)
  * The plugin 'hot corner' support also additional monitors and not
    primary monitor only. This option is configurable by user.
  * Use xfce library function instead of implementing own version
  * Enviroment varible XFDASHBOARD_PLUGINS_PATH supports now
    more than one additional path with a colon-seperated list
  * Improved loading performance of images and icons at
    XfdashboardImageContent as it will only start loading when the actor
    using this icon or image is mapped.
  * Improved CSS parser to determine recursion at theme CSS file
    which causes the application to crash due to run out of memory
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#143)
  * Rewrote XfdashboardButton by splitting it into a XfdashboardLabel
    class and make XfdashboardButton a sub-class of it.
    XfdashboardLabel is exactly the same what XfdashboardButton was but
    it does not emit the "click" signal.
  * Split XfdashboardLiveWindow into two classes.
    XfdashboardLiveWindowSimple just shows a live preview of a window
    when possible and XfdashboardLiveWindow is a sub-class of it but
    adds a title and controls layer (close button) on top of it.
  * Remove themable property 'show-window-content' from
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace.
  * The CSS class "primary-monitor" will be added to or removed from
    XfdashboardStageInterface depending on the primary state of
    associated monitor.
  * Made XfdashboardDynamicTableLayout stylable and added a new
    stylable property named "fixed-columns" to disable dynamic
    allocation of columns depending on largest width of a visible
    child found and enforce a fixed number of columns.
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#168)
  * Properties 'margin-top', 'margin-bottom', 'margin-left'
    and 'margin-right' of ClutterActor are now themable.
  * Allow windows view to filter windows which are at current workspace
    via a new themable property called 'filter-workspace-windows'.
    (gh#gmc-holle/xfdashboard#126)
  * Replace URLs from goodies.xfce.org to docs.xfce.org (bxo#16229)
  * Lots of larger and smaller bug-fixes
  * Lots of new API documentation
  * Translation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 18 18:57:27 UTC 2020 - Marcel <marcel@localhost>

- Update to 0.7.90
  * New feature: Support of animation if an actor is destroyed.
    It will be marked as destroyed by adding a CSS pseudo class 
    "destroying". The actor will be destroyed finally when
    animation ends.
  * The allocation animation will not be applied when actor is
    created. This behaviour has changed. If an actor should do an
    allocation animation also at the first time shown (created) the
    properties for x/y coordinates and/or width, height must be
    specified at "created" animation
  * New application icon which follows rDNS naming
  * Updated README.md for consistency
  * Use xfce library function instead of implementing own version
  * [plugin] Hot corner: Support also additional monitors and not
    primary monitor only. This option is configurable by user.
  * Enviroment varible XFDASHBOARD_PLUGINS_PATH supports now more
    than one additional path with a colon-seperated list
  * Reduced number of translatable string drastically
  * Translation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 27 20:48:49 UTC 2020 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.7.8
  * New feature: Support of more animations. So an actor can request
    an animation when a class or pseudo-class is added or was removed.
    Also an actor requests an animation when it was created and shown
    for the first time. Currently at last an animation is requested
    when the actor was moved and or resized.
  * Followed main Xfce project by switching to "foreign" mode
    at automake
  * Added dummy example search provider plugin. It's main purpose is
    to provide a skeleton for creating new search provider plugins.
  * Fixed a crash when reselecting a search result item on search
    update fails because its container was destroyed while updating.
  * Smaller bug fixes but mostly to silence compiler warnings
  * Translation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  3 11:06:11 UTC 2019 - Marcel Kuehlhorn <tux93@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.7.6
  * Raised minimum version of Glib to 2.38 for replacements
    of deprecated function g_type_class_add_private()
  * New feature: Support for animations. Currently only one actor
    (XfdashboardCollapseBox) trigger an animation signal to open
    or close the collapsed area. All default themes of xfdashboard
    will slide in or out the collapsed area smoothly when animation
    is enabled (which is enabled by default).
  * New feature: The user can turn on or off animations in the
    settings application.
  * Updated all GOject classes because of deprecation of function
    g_type_class_add_private()
  * Updated copyright years to 2019
  * Fix that valid desktop file for the same desktop ID but found
    at path of lower prioritory will override an invalid desktop
    file for the same desktop ID at path of higher priority. The
    first entry found - valid or invalid - will have the highest
    priority. Later all invalid desktop IDs in the application
    database are removed before populated. (GH#169)
  * Fixed warning "assertion 'GARCON_IS_MENU_DIRECTORY (other)'
    failed" when calling garcon_menu_directory_equal() in function
    _xfdashboard_applications_menu_model_find_similar_menu()
  * Fixed "implicit-fallthrough" compiler warnings in click action
  * Reduced number of release notes in AppData (GH#183)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 28 16:43:56 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.5.1:
  * Implemented new experimental code to delay window content
    creation finally and made it configurable.
  * Implemented an application tracker which tries to determine and
    to keep track of running applications.
  * With the implementation of the application tracker also running
    application which are not stored as favourites in quicklaunch
    will be added dynamically as temporary application buttons
    which look the same as stored favourites one.
  * Favourite will get CSS class '.favourite-app' added to its
    actor while dynamically added non-favourite actors get the CSS
    class '.dynamic-app' added.
  * Hide all dynamically added non-favourite actors when a
    drag'n'drop action is in progress.
  * Partially rewrote build system to create a static library for
    all files except the main file containing the main() function.
  * Began adding gtk-doc documentation annotations to various files.
  * Remove calls to xfdashboard_actor_contains_child_deep() and
    replaced them with clutter_actor_contains()
  * Add command-line option "--view". This command-line option
    "--view [internal name of view]" allows to specify which view to
    show when xfdashboard gets visible. This will only be applied
    once. It "overrides" any view configured in settings. (#12144)
  * Add session management to xfdashboard to restart it if it
    crashes (#12143)
  * Fixed a bug that pinned windows are not shown at newly created
    (but not current) workspace at XfdashboardLiveWorkspace

    "gtk-tooltip-timeout" was requested as it is deprecated and
    ignored by GTK+ derived application since GTK+ 3.10 and higher.
  * Some other bug-fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 15:14:49 CEST 2015 - tiwai@suse.de

- include /usr/share/appdata to file list for fixing build on old
  distros

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 13 09:49:59 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.5.0:
  * Added new experimental code to delay window content creation.
    It will make the application "feel" faster on machines with
    slow graphics card (e.g. slow texture creation or uploading).
    A resume queue was implemented which will create the window
    texture one after one when the application is idle. This should
    help not to block the application at start-up or when switching
    to workspaces with many windows resulting in a "feeling" that
    the application is faster and more responsive. To enable this
    experimental code the enviroment variable
    XFDASHBOARD_WINDOW_CONTENT_RESUME_ON_IDLE must be set to
    non-zero value when the application is started regardless
    if stand-alone or daemon mode.
  * New feature is a emblem effect called XfdashboardEmblemEffect.
    This new effect allows an icon to be drawn over an actor and
    can be added multiple times.
  * Improved tooltip to behave more the tooltip known of GTK+.
  * Improved search responsiveness by delaying initial search. But
    this delay is turned off by default so it behave like before.
    The delay can be configured in the settings. (GH #86)
  * XfdashboardLiveWindow will now reflect window state changes
    like urgent, minimized and pinned as CSS classes to get styles
    applied at one or more of this states.
  * The icon to show for an missing image can now be themed via the
    property 'missing-icon-name' at XfdashboardImageContent.
    It is not hard-coded to 'gtk-missing-image' anymore.
  * Implemented a new themable property 'show-window-content' at
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace to manage if a workspace actor (e.g.
    used in workspace selector) should show the window content of
    the windows at this workspace or to show the windows' icon
    instead. (GH #89)
  * Implemented also a new themable property 'background-image-type'
    at XfdashboardLiveWorkspace which behaves like the property
    'background-image-type' at XfdashboardStage(Interface). (GH #81)
  * Implemented a new property 'show-current-monitor-only' at
    XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector to limit the windows to show at
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace to the windows of the monitor where
    the selector is placed on. This feature can only be enabled in
    layout but not in CSS. All themes enable this feature. (GH #87)
  * Implemented a new signal 'window-monitor-changed' at window
    tracker to signal that a window has moved from one monitor to
    another. This signal is used by the windows view to determine
    if the moved window has to stay in this view or if another
    window view instance has to create an actor for this window and
    to handle it. (GH #88)
  * Do not track and handle window movements and resizes if the
    application is suspended. This should lower CPU usage while
    application is suspended and a window is moved or resized.
    (GH #44)
  * Reimplement old "hack" resize stage to screen size but this
    time also listen for screen size changes. This implementation
    is only needed when using Clutter version 1.17.1 or lower.
    It is checked at run-time if this "hack" is needed. (GH #95)
  * Changed method to find desktop window. This fixes problems
    finding desktop window in daemon mode (GH #80)
  * Show settings application menu entry also in other desktop
    environments than Xfce. (GH #78)
  * Fixed a bug that the windows view did not recognize that a
    window has move to the current active workspace when a
    workspace was removed and it did not show the moved window in
    view. (GH #91)
  * Fixed a bug that the functions to determine the preferred width
    and height in XfdashboardScaledTableLayout are called
    recursively and crashes the application
  * Fixed calculation of workspace selector's size by fraction or
    maximum size in multi-monitor setup by using size of
    XfdashboardStageInterface for calculation instead of stage's
    size which is the size of all monitors.
  * Fixed duplicate IDs in CSS selectors by throwing an error.
  * Lots of memleaks fixed.
  * Lots of other bug-fixes.
  * Lots of typos fixed.
  * Updated translations:
    + es (prflr88);
    + he (GenghisKhan);
    + it_IT (cri);
    + sr (salepetronije);
  * New translations:
    + fr (jc1).

Sun May 31 12:53:45 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.4.2:
  * Fixed check against wrong major version of Clutter for old hack
    to resize stage to screen size. Also changed this check from
    compile-time to runtime.

    finding desktop window in daemon mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 29 10:21:26 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.3.91:
  * Fixed a bug that translations are not used in xfdashboard.
  * Fixed a visual bug in XfdashboardStageInterface which caused
    that clipping in XfdashboardViewpad did not work anymore and
    overlapped other actors.
  * Implemented a box layout manager called XfdashboardBoxLayout
    which is derived from ClutterBoxLayout and inherits all
    functions and properties. It only disregards text direction
    settings to enforce a horizontal left-to-right layout of its

Thu Mar 19 17:32:30 UTC 2015 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 0.3.90:
  * New feature: Implemented multi-monitor support. This also added
    a new interface ID "secondary" to themes which specifies how
    the stage for non-primary monitors looks like. (#14)
  * Added an option "/components/applications-view/show-all-apps"
    to settings which adds an "All applications" menu entry to
    applications view and shows all installed applications in this
    menu. It is disabled by default but configurable in settings.
  * Replaced GTK+ stock icons with named icons
  * Enforce X11 backend at Clutter to prevent start-up crashes when
    using Clutter 1.21.4 or higher which uses GDK backend by default.
    xfdashboard uses some X11 related function at Clutter (#73)
  * Clear startup-notification when application enters main loop
  * Fixed compiler warnings, build system and other smaller bug fixes
  * Updated translations: 
    + es (prflr88)
