Fri Mar 17 13:04:00 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 1.4.20
  * Security fixes
    + This maintenance release addresses the security
      vulnerabilities CVE-2022-40151 (bsc#1203520) and
      CVE-2022-41966 (bsc#1206729), causing a Denial of Service by
      raising a stack overflow. It also provides new converters for
      Optional and Atomic types.
  * Major changes
    + #308: Add converter for AtomicBoolean, AtomicInteger,
      AtomicLong, and AtomicReference of package
      java.util.concurrent.atomic.
    + #293: Add converter for Optional, OptionalDouble, OptionalInt,
      and OptionalLong of package java.util.
  * Minor changes
    + #287: Close stream opened from provided URL.
    + #284: Fix disabling check against hash code attack with
      XStream.setCollectionUpdateLimit(0).
  * Stream compatibility
    + The atomic types with new converters of package
      java.util.concurrent.atomic, that have been written with
      previous versions of XStream, can still be deserialized.
    + The Optional types with new converters of package java.util,
      that have been written with previous versions of XStream,
      can still be deserialized.
    + The WildcardTypePermission allows by default no longer
      anonymous class types.
  * API changes
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicBooleanConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicIntegerConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicLongConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicReferenceConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalDoubleConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalIntConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalLongConverter.
    + Added c.t.x.security.WildcardTypePermission
      .WildcardTypePermission(boolean,String[]).

- Upgrade to 1.4.18
  * Security fixes
    + This maintenance release addresses following security
      vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with an XStream instance
      using the default blacklist of an uninitialized security
      framework. XStream is therefore now using a whitelist by
      default. (CVE-2021-39139, CVE-2021-39140, CVE-2021-39141,
      CVE-2021-39144, CVE-2021-39145, CVE-2021-39146,
      CVE-2021-39147, CVE-2021-39148, CVE-2021-39149,
      CVE-2021-39150, CVE-2021-39151, CVE-2021-39152,
      CVE-2021-39153, CVE-2021-39154, bsc#1189798)
  * Minor changes
    + Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with
      PureJavaReflectionConverter.
  * Stream compatibility
    + Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains
      a Security Framework to implement a black- or whitelist for
      the allowed types at deserialization time. Until version
      1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all
      types of the Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of
      security attacks, in order to guarantee optimal runtime
      compatibility for existing users. However, this approach has
      failed. The last months have shown, that the Java runtime
      alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack,
      not even looking at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath.
      The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a
      whitelist, which is recommended since nine years. It also has
      been complaining on the console for a long time about an
      uninitialized security framework the first time it was run.
      Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
      security framework for their own scenario can easily update
      to the new version without any problem. Everyone else will
      have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new
      version will fail with certainty at deserialization time.
