- Upgrade to 1.4.21
  * Security fixes
    + This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
      CVE-2024-47072 (bsc#1233085), when using the BinaryDriver to
      unmarshal a manipulated input stream causing a Denial of
      Service due to a stack overflow.
  * Major changes
    + #350: Optimize memory allocation
    + Add a converter for the WeakHashMap which does not write any
      elements of the map. Avoids also access to the ReentrantLock
      contained in the WeakHashMap since Java 19.
  * Minor changes
    + #335: Allow PrettyPrintWriter to replace invalid XML
      characters when not running in quirks mode
    + #331, #326: Fix handling of empty
      java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference
    + #334: Fix remaining buffer size calculation in QuickWriter
    + #342: Optimize internal handling of children in DomReader
      avoiding O(n^2) access times for siblings
    + #349: Fix support of lambda objects for Java 21 and above
    + #359: Add KEYS file with public keys to verify signed
      artifacts.
    + Detect input manipulation in
      c.t.x.io.binary.BinaryStreamReader.
    + Use Jettison 1.5.4 by default for Java Runtimes version 8 or
      higher.
  * API changes
    + Added constant
      c.t.x.io.xml.PrettyPrintWriter.XML_1_0_REPLACEMENT.
    + Added constant
      c.t.x.io.xml.PrettyPrintWriter.XML_1_1_REPLACEMENT.
    + Added c.t.x.converters.collections.WeakHashMapConverter.
    + Protected field fieldsToOmit of
      c.t.x.mapper.ElementIgnoringMapper set to private.
    + Protected field unknownElementsToIgnore of
      c.t.x.mapper.ElementIgnoringMapper set to private.
  * Stream compatibility
    + The WeakHashMaps, that have been written with previous
      versions of XStream, can still be deserialized.

      vulnerabilities CVE-2022-40151 (bsc#1203520) and
      CVE-2022-41966 (bsc#1206729), causing a Denial of Service by

Tue Sep 28 05:49:16 UTC 2021 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 1.4.18
  * Security fixes
    + This maintenance release addresses following security
      vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with an XStream instance
      using the default blacklist of an uninitialized security
      framework. XStream is therefore now using a whitelist by
      default. (CVE-2021-39139, CVE-2021-39140, CVE-2021-39141,
      CVE-2021-39144, CVE-2021-39145, CVE-2021-39146,
      CVE-2021-39147, CVE-2021-39148, CVE-2021-39149,
      CVE-2021-39150, CVE-2021-39151, CVE-2021-39152,
      CVE-2021-39153, CVE-2021-39154, bsc#1189798)
  * Minor changes
    + Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with
      PureJavaReflectionConverter.
  * Stream compatibility
    + Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains
      a Security Framework to implement a black- or whitelist for
      the allowed types at deserialization time. Until version
      1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all
      types of the Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of
      security attacks, in order to guarantee optimal runtime
      compatibility for existing users. However, this approach has
      failed. The last months have shown, that the Java runtime
      alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack,
      not even looking at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath.
      The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a
      whitelist, which is recommended since nine years. It also has
      been complaining on the console for a long time about an
      uninitialized security framework the first time it was run.
      Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
      security framework for their own scenario can easily update
      to the new version without any problem. Everyone else will
      have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new
      version will fail with certainty at deserialization time.

      security framework
