  <title>An open source RDP server</title>
  <description>Based on the work of FreeRDP and rdesktop, xrdp uses the remote desktop protocol to present a GUI to the user.

The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional Linux terminal server, capable of accepting connections from rdesktop, freerdp, and Microsoft's own terminal server / remote desktop clients.</description>
