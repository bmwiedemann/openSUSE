    <comment>- Update to 1.3.18
  * Fix bug: infinite recursion if you try to format a floating 
		point value that was created from something other than a 
		finite number. Creation of a floating point XML-RPC value from 
		something other than a number now fails.</comment>

    <comment>- update to 1.51.06:
  * Build: fix bug: won't compile with --enable-libxml2, introduced with Release 1.44 (December 2015).
  * Remove trace statements accidentally added in Release 1.51.00. (Released December 2017, promoted to Super Stable March 2019).
  * Build: fix bug: ignores LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, LDFLAGS_PERSONAL, and LDFLAGS_PTHREAD when building the build tool Gennmtab.
  * Fix tiny memory leak in virtually impossible low memory situation.
  * Fix bug: 'toValue' won't compile for vector of vectors or map of vectors. Thanks Yang Bo .
  * Build: fix missing xmlrpc-c/config.h include file in separate build tree build. Thanks Philip Belemezov &lt;philip@belemezov.net&gt;.
  * Build: Add --disable-abyss-openssl for build environments that appear to have Openssl but don't really. (A Pkg-config design flaw makes that happen sometimes - you can't control what directories it searches for .pc files).
  * Windows build: add Visual Studio 2017 project files, fix various things broken for Windows in recent updates. Thanks to Maksym Veremeyenko .
  * Disable 10M restriction on document size in Libxml2 XML parser.
  * Build: Recognize additional Linux &quot;host OS&quot; environments. E.g. &quot;linux-uclibc&quot;.
  * Build: replace BUILDTOOL_CC and BUILDTOOL_CCLD with more conventional CC_FOR_BUILD. Add CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD, LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD.
  * Build: Don't attempt to build C++ internal utility module cmdline_parser_cpp if we aren't building the C++ libraries. In that case, 1) it isn't needed, and 2) the environment probably is incapable of compiling C++.
  * Build: Use AC_CHECK_TOOL to determine 'ar' command and AC_PROG_RANLIB to determine 'ranlib' command to use.
  * Build: fix compile failure in build for a system that does not have Unicode wide characters (wchar_t).
  * Packet stream client: Add option to throw a BrokenConnEx exception when transport fails because the server hung up or network broke, instead of throwing error.
  * Add ServerAbyss::getListenName method, ChanSwitchUnixGetListeName: ability to find out on what port your server is listening.
  * Packet stream server ('serverPstreamConn'): fix bug: runOnce() fails with indication that it was interrupted when the server hangs up. Always broken (interruptible RunOnce() was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008).
  * Fix compile failure with old OpenSSL that doesn't have SSL_ERROR_WANT_ACCEPT. Introduced in Xmlrpc-c 1.45.
  * Add SSL/TLS capability via OpenSSL to Abyss server.
  * Fix xmlrpc_mem_block accidentally made private in 1.44.
  * Build: Remove example and test program usage of XML parser facility (&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlparser.h&gt;), which was made private in 1.44, so the examples and tools no longer build.
  * C++: Add 'toValue' and 'fromValue' for 64-bit integer (xmlrpc_c::value_i8).
  * Memory block utility: Remove xmlrpc_mem_block_init and xmlrpc_mem_block_clean. These complicate forward compatibility and probably were never used. xmlrpc_mem_block_new and xmlrpc_mem_block_free remain to fulfill the same purpose.
  * Remove XML parser (&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlparser.h&gt;) from external API. This is not specific to XML-RPC, so has no business being a service of Xmlrpc-c. It is just an abstraction to allow us to use various XML parsing libraries (to wit, Expat and Libxml2). We don't think it was ever used externally.
  * Add xmlrpc_value_new(): deep copy of xmlrpc_value.
  * Abyss C++: Add 'terminate' and 'resetTerminate' methods, analogous to C Abyss 'ServerTerminate' and 'ServerResetTerminate'.
  * Fix bug: infinite recursion if you try to format a floating point value that was created from something other than a finite number. Creation of a floating point XML-RPC value from something other than a number now fails. Introduced in Xmlrpc-c 1.15 (June 2008).
  * Curl client: fix garbage in message where explanation from Curl library belongs. Always there, with some Curl libraries.
  * Curl client: fix instantaneous timeout with some Curl libraries. Introduced in Xmlrpc-c 1.41 (March 2015).</comment>
