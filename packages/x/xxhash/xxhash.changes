- update to version 0.7.1
  - XXH3 updates:
    * Secret first : the algorithm computation can be altered by
      providing a "secret", which is any blob of bytes, of 
      size >= XXH3_SECRET_SIZE_MIN.
    * seed is still available, and acts as a secret generator
    * As a consequence of these changes, note that new return
      values of XXH3 are not compatible with v0.7.0
    * updated ARM NEON variant
    * Streaming implementation is available
    * Improve compatibility and performance with Visual Studio
    * Better integration when using XXH_INLINE_ALL : do not pollute
      host namespace, use its own macros, such as XXH_ASSERT(), XXH_ALIGN, etc.
    * 128-bits variant provide helper function, for comparison of hashes.
  - general improvements:
    * Better clang generation of rotl instruction
    * XXH_REROLL build macro, to reduce binary size
    * Improved cmake script
    * Full benchmark program provided in /tests/bench

- update to version 0.7.0
  - Add XXH3 hash algorithm

  derive from Argon2 algorithm.

- update to version 0.6.5
  -  Improved performance on small keys, thanks to suggestions from Jens Bauer
  -  New build macro, XXH_INLINE_ALL, extremely effective for small keys of fixed length (see this article for details)
  -  XXH32() : better performance on OS-X clang by disabling auto-vectorization
  -  Improved benchmark measurements accuracy on small keys
  -  Included xxHash specification document
