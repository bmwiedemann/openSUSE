x86/irq: handle moving interrupts in _assign_irq_vector()

Currently there's logic in fixup_irqs() that attempts to prevent
_assign_irq_vector() from failing, as fixup_irqs() is required to evacuate all
interrupts from the CPUs not present in the input mask.  The current logic in
fixup_irqs() is incomplete, as it doesn't deal with interrupts that have
move_cleanup_count > 0 and a non-empty ->arch.old_cpu_mask field.

Instead of attempting to fixup the interrupt descriptor in fixup_irqs() so that
_assign_irq_vector() cannot fail, introduce logic in _assign_irq_vector()
to deal with interrupts that have either move_{in_progress,cleanup_count} set
and no remaining online CPUs in ->arch.cpu_mask.

If _assign_irq_vector() is requested to move an interrupt in the state
described above, first attempt to see if ->arch.old_cpu_mask contains any valid
CPUs that could be used as fallback, and if that's the case do move the
interrupt back to the previous destination.  Note this is easier because the
vector hasn't been released yet, so there's no need to allocate and setup a new
vector on the destination.

Due to the logic in fixup_irqs() that clears offline CPUs from
->arch.old_cpu_mask (and releases the old vector if the mask becomes empty) it
shouldn't be possible to get into _assign_irq_vector() with
->arch.move_{in_progress,cleanup_count} set but no online CPUs in
->arch.old_cpu_mask.

However if ->arch.move_{in_progress,cleanup_count} is set and the interrupt has
also changed affinity, it's possible the members of ->arch.old_cpu_mask are no
longer part of the affinity set, move the interrupt to a different CPU part of
the provided mask and keep the current ->arch.old_{cpu_mask,vector} for the
pending interrupt movement to be completed.
