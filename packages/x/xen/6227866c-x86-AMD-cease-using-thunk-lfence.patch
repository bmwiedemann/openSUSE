x86/spec-ctrl: Cease using thunk=lfence on AMD

AMD have updated their Spectre v2 guidance, and lfence/jmp is no longer
considered safe.  AMD are recommending using retpoline everywhere.

Retpoline is incompatible with CET.  All CET-capable hardware has efficient
IBRS (specifically, not something retrofitted in microcode), so use IBRS (and
STIBP for consistency sake).

This is a logical change on AMD, but not on Intel as the default calculations
would end up with these settings anyway.  Leave behind a message if IBRS is
found to be missing.

Also update the default heuristics to never select THUNK_LFENCE.  This causes
AMD CPUs to change their default to retpoline.

Also update the printed message to include the AMD MSR_SPEC_CTRL settings, and
STIBP now that we set it for consistency sake.

This is part of XSA-398 / CVE-2021-26401.
