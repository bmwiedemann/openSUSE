Subject: libxc sr xl migration debug

xl: fix description of migrate --debug

xl migrate --debug used to track every pfn in every batch of pages.
But these times are gone. The code in xc_domain_save is the consumer
of this knob, now may enable verification mode.

Signed-off-by: Olaf Hering <olaf@aepfle.de>

v03:
- adjust to describe what --debug would do when the code which
  consumes this knob is fixed.
v02:
- the option has no effect anymore
