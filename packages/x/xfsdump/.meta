  <title>Administrative Utilities for the XFS File System</title>
  <description>The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore, and a number of other
utilities for administering XFS file systems.

xfsdump examines files in a file system, determines which files need to
be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or
other storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing
the dump of an XFS file system and also knows how to backup XFS
extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are &quot;endian safe&quot;
and can thus be transferred between Linux machines of different
architectures and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump.  It can restore a
full backup of a file system.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.</description>
