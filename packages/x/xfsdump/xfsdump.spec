%description
The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore, and a number of other
utilities for administering XFS file systems.

xfsdump examines files in a file system, determines which files need to
be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or
other storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing
the dump of an XFS file system and also knows how to backup XFS
extended attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe"
and can thus be transferred between Linux machines of different
architectures and also between IRIX machines.

xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump.  It can restore a
full backup of a file system.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.
