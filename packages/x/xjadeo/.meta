  <description>Xjadeo is a very simple video player that gets sync from jack. When a
sequencer like Muse or Rosegarden acts as a timebase master, xjadeo
will display the video frame in sync with the sequencer
transport. This means that you can visually synchronize an audio event
with a certain frame in the movie, which comes quite handy when you
want to create a soundtrack for a video clip.
