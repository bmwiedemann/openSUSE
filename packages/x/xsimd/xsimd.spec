%description
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors that
has been available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a single operation
on a batch of values at once, and thus provide a way to significantly accelerate
code execution. However, these instructions differ between microprocessor
vendors and compilers.

xsimd provides a unified means for using these features for library authors.
Namely, it enables manipulation of batches of numbers with the same arithmetic
operators as for single values. It also provides accelerated implementation of
common mathematical functions operating on batches.
