  <title>Prompt on exiting X</title>
  <description>`xtexit` sends an request to all clients to shut down. If the
application still needs an user interaction (e.g., if a file should be
saved) this is possible.

If you answer by the affirmative, all applications will be closed. This
method is not fully waterproof, but better than killing each and every
client without being able to interfere.

xterm applications anyway are killed immediately!

If this package is installed, it will be automatically integrated into
the sample user fvwm menu.</description>
