Fri Mar 22 13:02:26 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- Update to release 19.0.1
  * Fixes for two regressions which crept into the 19.0.0 release.
  * Add support for RandR output tile properties, allowing monitors
    using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport tiling to work better
    out of the box. (Note that DP MST support in the radeon kernel
    driver is still experimental and disabled by default)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  7 10:28:00 UTC 2019 - Stefan Dirsch <sndirsch@suse.com>

- Update to release 19.0.0
  * Various TearFree related fixes and robustness improvements.
  * Up to six independent instances per GPU are now supported in
    "Zaphod" style multi-head configurations.
  * Other improvements and fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 15 14:00:13 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to release 18.1.0
  * This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.20.
  * Fixed random screen corruption and crashes when using GLAMOR with Xorg
    1.20.
  * Support for leasing RandR outputs to clients.
  * Various robustness fixes for TearFree. In particular, fixed several
    cases in which disabling TearFree at runtime would result in the Xorg
    process freezing or crashing.
  * Fixed some m4 related build issues with older versions of autotools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 16 14:19:06 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to release 18.0.99 (git describe: 18.0.1-44-g740f0850)
  * supposed to provide a fix for boo#1100759, fdo#107528, fdo#105381

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 13:00:02 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to release 18.0.1
  * This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.19. It also works with
    xserver 1.20 RC1, so unless something unexpected happens, it should work
    with xserver 1.20 as well.
    This is a bug-fix release addressing issues in 18.0.0. While those
    issues shouldn't affect most users, I recommend that all users of 18.0.0
    update to 18.0.1.
    + The Xorg process could crash when multiple primary screens are
      configured in xorg.conf.
    + TearFree could trigger debugging messages in the pixman library

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  7 11:49:14 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- "I'm pleased to announce the 18.0.0 release of xf86-video-ati, the Xorg
  driver for ATI/AMD Radeon GPUs supported by the radeon kernel driver.
  This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.19. It also works with
  xserver 1.20 RC1, so unless something unexpected happens, it should work
  with xserver 1.20 as well."
  Highlights:
  * New year-based versioning scheme
  * Page flipping can now be used even when the HW cursor can't be used in
    some cases
  * Support for 30-bit RGB colour output. Note that gamma correction is
    currently not available with 30-bit colour. Also, GLAMOR hardware
    acceleration is not available with 30-bit colour with xserver versions
    before 1.20.
  Plus other improvements and fixes. Thanks to everybody who contributed
  to this release in any way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 11:03:40 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Stick to use pkgconfig style dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 12 14:14:07 UTC 2017 - msrb@suse.com

- Remove build dependency on Mesa-devel, it is not needed. Add
  build dependency on damageproto-devel which is needed and was
  pulled in by Mesa-devel before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  8 09:00:27 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 7.10.0
  * Clients can now use DRI page flipping even while TearFree is enabled
  for any CRTC. This should improve performance of such clients
  (including compositing managers) while TearFree is enabled, and avoid
  other issues such as tearing on other CRTCs where TearFree isn't
  enabled.
  * The driver now takes measures to prevent other DRM master processes
  (potentially from other local users) from accessing buffers created by
  this driver while switched away to a different VT. Other DRM master
  processes should only be able to access a single buffer anymore, which
  contains only all-black pixels.
  * The gamma ramp is now applied to the HW cursor as well, so the HW
  cursor doesn't look odd when e.g. using Redshift or similar tools.
  * Plus other improvements and fixes. Thanks to everybody who
  contributed to this release in any way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 10:18:51 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- SLE merge (missing fate/bugzilla entries)
  * bsc#990066 (we have even newer version than 7.7 meanwhile)
  * fate #320388 (factory is building against an even higher
    Xserver version, so covered as well)
  * fate #315643-315645, 319159-319161, 319618 (we have the latest
    available radeon driver X driver)
  * bsc#936452, FATE#319131 (seems this macro is no longer been used
    also in sle12-sp2)
  * bnc#896378 (also handled in factory, but patch is meanwhile
    upstream and included in driver release 7.9.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 16 12:03:22 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 7.9.0:
  * Allow TearFree to be toggled at runtime via an RandR output
    property  "TearFree". The xorg.conf option "TearFree" now
    controls the default value of the output properties.
  * Use glamor by default for 2D acceleration with >= R600 and
    Xorg >= 1.18.3.
  * Ship 10-radeon.conf xorg.conf.d snippet for Xorg >= 1.16, so
    that the radeon driver can be loaded automatically even when
    the ati wrapper driver isn't installed.
  * Support loading the amdgpu driver from the ati wrapper driver.
  * Use DRM render nodes for DRI3 clients when available.
  * Plus many other improvements and fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 19 15:08:54 UTC 2016 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 7.8.0:
  This release supports xserver versions 1.10-1.19.
  Highlights:
  + Significant 2D compositing performance increase, in particular with
    glamor enabled.
  + Option "TearFree" can now prevent tearing in all possible display
    configurations (with current versions of Xorg). Specifically, it's
    now also effective with arbitrary RandR transforms and with RandR 1.4
    slave output.
  + DRI3 is now enabled by default if the Xorg version is >= 1.18.3 and
    glamor is enabled.
  + DRI3/Present asynchronous page flips are now supported (requires
    corresponding kernel driver support, available in current versions of
    the Linux kernel). This can increase performance of fullscreen
    applications with sync-to-vblank disabled.
  + The HW cursor can now be used with RandR 1.4 slave output or with
    TearFree & rotation.
  + Performance improvements with RandR 1.4 slave output.
  + The list of supported GPUs in the Xorg log file has been slightly
    tidied up.
  + RandR 1.4 provider capabilities are now advertised more accurately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 19 13:32:04 UTC 2016 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 7.7.1:
  This release supports xserver versions 1.9-1.18.
  This is a stable point release containing only fixes for crash/hang/
  corruption bugs and other minor changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  8 13:36:42 UTC 2016 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 7.7:
  * Option "TearFree" can now prevent tearing with rotation/reflection as
    well (with Xorg >= 1.16).
  * RandR CRTC transforms now work correctly (but for now still exhibit
    tearing even with TearFree).
  * The RandR 1.4 provider name is now no longer hardcoded to "radeon"
    but constructed from the GPU chipset name and bus ID, allowing
    several GPUs supported by this driver to be distinguished by name.
  * The RandR primary output is now always explicitly marked as such.
  * The driver can now make use of more than 256MB of VRAM for scanout
    buffers, allowing e.g. virtual desktop sizes >= 8192x8192 to work.
  * The driver can prevent clients trying to use the DRI3 extension over a
    display connection forwarded via SSH from hanging.
  * Many more fixes for issues using the DRI3/Present extensions.
