- Update to xfig 3.2.7 Patchlevel 7a (May 2017)
  o Export to pdf now allows to choose between output to a full-page pdf,
    or cropping to the bounding box (the default behavior).
  o Enable horizontal scrolling with mouse buttons 6 and 7 (sideway push
    of mouse wheel, or horizontal movement on touchpad).
  o Rename the text flag "Special Flag" to "TeX Flag".
  o Interpolated splines are now created with the recommended value of the
    shape factor of -0.5, not with -1.0. A description of the shape factor
  o Really fix ticket #9, debian bug #270113. When entering the "Open.."
    dialog, moving to a new directory, pressing Cancel, a subsequent
    "Save" placed the figure file into the new directory.
  o Center canvas around cursor when zooming by pressing CTRL and using a
    wheel-mouse.
  o Apply xfig-3.2.6a-fallback-for-nonscalable-fonts.patch and
    xfig-3.2.6a-scalable-fonts.patch from Hans de Goede.
  o Apply debian patches 08_every_time.patch, 10_RELEASE_DATE.patch,
    11_declare_swap_colors.patch, from Roland Rosenfeld.
  o Apply debian patch 07_colorsliderarrows.patch. Debian bug #870365.
  o Change map of India to disputed boundaries, from
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_disputed_areas_map.svg,
    retrieved 2018-02-25. Debian bug #270799, 09_india_disputed.patch
  o Prevent integer overflow in {floor,ceil}_coords_{x,y}(). Fixes debian
    bug #300436. Also prevent integer overflow in round_coords().
  o Completely remove alloca.h and alloca() from the code.
  o When entering the "Save as..." dialog, moving to a new directory and
    pressing "Cancel", a subsequent "Save" wrote to the new directory.
    This happened analogously for the "Export" dialog. Fixed, ticket #9.

- use default libpng for build, problems with newer library 
  already fixed in version 3.2.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  2 13:40:36 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Update to xfig 3.2.6 Patchlevel 6a (January 2017)
  CHANGES:
    o Draw lines with the same width as in PostScript and other outputs.
  BUGS FIXED:
    o Add compile-switch --enable-tablet for using an input tablet.
    o Eventually, sorted out the xpm switches. Only use --enable-xpm-splash.
    o Improve ./configure and add diagnostic output. Looks now for headers
      and libraries in unusal places, for compilation under mac darwin when
      using fink or macports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 14 01:58:36 CET 2017 - oliver@getspam.de

- Fix: Added preprocessor flag GSBIT to fix a 3.2.6 regression, that

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 22 10:40:28 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Update to xfig 3.2.6
  New features:
    o Add compile switch to enable xpm-icon and xpm-splash screen
      independently (--enable-xpm-icon, --enable-xpm-splash).
    o New compile switch --enable-versioning, calls update_version_m4
      to get version information from a source control system.
    o Should compile on Mac (Darwin) after installing dependencies using
      Macports, Fink or Homebrew.
    o Add two rudimentary tests. Run with make check.
    o New tikz and pict2e export drivers.
    o Build using autoconf (./configure; make; make install).
  UI changes:
    From Brian V. Smith. These changes were made because the original
    view was of the drawing on the page instead of the modern view
    of the observer moving left/right/up/down:
      o Left arrow moves observer left (used to scroll canvas left)
      o Right arrow moves observer right
      o Up arrow moves observer up
      o Down arrow moves observer down
      o Ctrl+Wheel up zooms in, Ctrl+Wheel down zooms out (was the other way around)
  Bugs fixed:
    o Update documentation to LaTeX and Xfig.
    o Change \r\n to \n in all files.
    From Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.de>:
      o Update LaTeX documentation, use \documentclass instead of
        \documentstyle, \usepackage instead of \input.
      o Builds on hurd, had to #include <limits.h> in a few places.
      o Use application/x-xfig, not image/x-xfig in xfig.desktop file.
        See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfig/+bug/690067 and
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfig/+bug/1045848 .
      o To compile on ancient systems, try make -DANCIENT.
      o Report correct paths to installed files in the man page.
    From Vladislav Zavjalov; Commit numbers refer to
    http://git.altlinux.org/people/slazav/packages/?p=xfig.git;a=commit;h=#
      o Preserve comments when deleting objects; Commit #6c42e5c
      o Restore colors and main comment after Delete All + Undo; #34f6105

      o Do not link with -lXmu, if linking with Xaw3d > 1.5e.
      o Make japanese documentation available for LANG=ja_JP.ujis.
      o Set the Creation date in xfig_man.html to the date when
        creating the source tarball.
      o Really fix reading png files,
        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1150330
      o Delete some superfluos files, fix typos (Caribbean),
        add semicolon in xfig.desktop (bug # 812477).
    From Brian V. Smith:
      o old link for "Xfig On Microsoft Windows" (Getting and Installing Xfig html page)
      o dash_list wrong dimension causes segfault on some line styles
      o Should handle systems where REG_NOERROR (regular expression) is undefined now
      o Missing xfig_man.html
      o Modify a few places where to set locale to "C".
      o Didn't allocate enough space for fonts (would segfault when popping up File panels)
      o Moving arc point would segfault
    From Roland Rosenfeld. Bug numbers refer to https://bugs.debian.org/#.
      In fact, most of the bugs below, also those from other sources, were
      fixed by applying the debian-patches.

- Update to xfig 3.2.5b including various bug fixes (including the
  bug fix for bnc#560351):
  * Dimension line indicator incorrectly showed arrow length/width
  * Several patches from Fedora xfig maintainer
  * divide by 0 under certain circumstances in ruler code
    From Libor Pechacek
  * Segfault if PRINTER env variable was not defined
  * Fig-color merged into Fig app-defaults file because almost no one knows about
    the "*customization: -color" option to make X programs read the color def file.
  * dimension line arrowhead width and length used %d instead of %f in
    dialog, always displaying 0
  * leftover debugging printf(...color = ) in startup
  * finally fixed size of mode panel so it doesn't cover indicator panel
    under certain circumstances
  * removed "Alpha" from splash
  * updated copyright date in Help/About
  * problem with depth panel height due to snap mode indicator
  * snap indicator indicated "Focus" when "Diameter" was selected
  * w_keyboard.c had pointer assignment reversed
  * extraneous "done" in Imakefile in "install.jhtml" section
    From Eric Scott
  * many protoytpe cleanups from Eric Scott
  * #ifndef __FreeBSD__ added around #include  from Eric Scott
  * uses rint() instead of lrint() for those with non-C99 compilers
  * Solaris doesn't have REG_NOERROR for regex, so have new #define for that
  * added dependency on version.h and patchlevel.h for f_util.c and f_save.c to
    Imakefile
  * In imperial fractional scale mode, if the user scale factor wasn't 1.0, xfig
    would switch to decimal mode.  This has been fixed to remain in fractional mode.
  * Added condition for GLIBC to not declare srandom(int)
  * Better resizing of message popup panel
  * Map of Spain included Portugal. From Eugen Dedu.
  * Double-clicking on either style or family would crash xfig
  * Export/Print grid units were not reset when loading Fig file of different units
  * When converting empty export/print grid units to fractional inches would make 0/2
  * Escaped hyphens in man page
    From Roland Rosendfeld
  * When exporting to all three: PostScript, PDF and TeX, incorrectly generated
    PostScript and PDF that included LaTeX-only (special) text
  * Bug when doing Save As to a shorter filename - would corrupt name sometimes
  * Note about 450 pixels/cm didn't make it from the FORMAT3.1 file to FORMAT3.2
  * Print command was using -P instead of -d for lp
  * On Cygwin, needed to double-escape PRINTER environment when backslashes in name
  * w_library.c had incompatible poiner type in call to ScanLibraryDirectory
  * Not enough characters allocated for ruler inch/cm indicators.  Would cause segfault
    on zooming out because of longer ruler text, e.g. -10210cm
  * 22 new arrowhead types
  * changed default browser to firefox and default pdf viewer to xpdf
  * HTML MAP export (fig2dev) produces reference to .png file instead of .gif now
  * A note added to i18n.html that says if you run fig2dev standalone, you must
    pass the -j option to it
  * No need to have the C99 complex functions in the math library.
  * New computers from Andre Esser (Libraries/Computers)
  * Some network icons colored and/or combined by Roland Rosenfeld.
  * When exporting only active layers have choice of bounding area of whole
    figure or only the active layers
  * Two new library figures - piano_keyboard.fig, top view of a piano keyboard
    by Reinaert Albrecht, and piano_keyboard_perspect.fig, a perspective
    view of a piano keyboard by Brian Smith, both in the Libraries/Music
    directory.
  * New library figure - scissors.fig in Libraries/OfficeEquip from Kasie
    Breezer Talbot
  * Search tolerance increased from 4 pixels to 10 for zoom < 20
  * Isometric grid to ease making isometric drawings
    From Jasper Wesselingh
  * New 37-pin D connector and 50-pin ribbon connector in Libraries/Electronic/Physical

Mon May  7 16:44:45 CEST 2007 - werner@suse.de

- Make it work as it should:
  * Be sure that horizontal sidebar ruler and other elements are
    visible all the time.  This requires small modifications in the
    calculations of the positions of a lot of elements/classes.
  * Make splash screen show `3.2.5' instead of `3.2.5 - alpha5'
  * Supress not wanted debug message
- Update to xfig 3.2.5 including various bug fixes, from the
  CHANGES file (bug #267840):
  * Shift-U accelerator added to popup units panel
  * The library menu button sizes with the library panel, to show longer
    path names if the user wants.
  * The cursor for drawing lines, splines, etc. is a crosshair now instead
    of an arrow.
  * Snap features to allow snapping points to endpoints, midpoints and
    intersections of other objects.
    From Chris Moller.
  * Keyboard input of object coordinates for precise positioning.
    From Chris Moller.
  * Can grab arc anywhere along the curve instead of just at grab points
    From Chris Moller.
  * Added -noflipvisualhints for cases where, due to "different" pointer
    devices, they aren't really flipped, but the mapping indicates they are.
  * Export to all of PS, PDF and LaTeX in one operation
    From Alistair Ramsey
  * Reorganized Networks library and new devices: ASX-200, 1000, and 4000
    by Bill Chimiak
  * New figures "betty.fig" (Betty Boop) and "nikke.fig" (German detective
    Nick Knatter) in Libraries/Examples drawn by Markku Reunanen
  * Can finish text input by pressing Escape.  This removes the cancellation
    of a compose sequence (e.g. a-umlaut)
  * Actually a bug fix, import of PDF files is now possible.  The code was
    there since version 3.2.3, but the user interface was not.
  * Nearly-full ANSI protoization of code by Harald Koenig
  * Installation of Libraries and doc files faster with tar instead of shell loop
  * New Gregorian chant music symbols from Bill Chimiak.  Also, Music library
    divided into "chant" and "modern"
  * Popup edit panel slightly more compact vertically
  * New library "Fasteners" containing various bolts and screws
    From Jim Yuzwalk
  * Increased size of numeric entry fields in indicator panels
  * N-channel IGBT in Electronic/Schematics Library from Art Blair
  * starting values for arrow type, width, length, thickness may be specified
    on command-line or in X resources:
    -startarrowtype, -startarrowwidth, -startarrowlength, -startarrowthick
  * xfig would crash on 64-bit processors because of a missing include, which 
    causes new_string() to be declared implicitly as returning an integer.
    This may cause the top 32 bits to get lost and hence the crash.
  * Blanks not preserved in imported picture filename when reading Fig file
  * When in metric mode, decimal precision was ignored for dimension lines
  * When showing vertex numbers on objects, first vertex is now 0 to match
    edit window vertex numbers
  * Also, vertex numbers are not shown on inactive (grayed) layers
  * Widget shadow resources moved from Fig-color to Fig because they don't
    really have anything to do with color. There was a problem when running
    KDE because it set a global resource *Scrollbar*height: which made xfig 
    freeze when *customization: -color was NOT used.
  * The point positioning indicator is turned on when editing a compound
    object to show the user that it is used
  * Increased the maximum size of images that can be imported.  There was
    a limit in the PostScript image encoder of 4096x4096 pixels.  This was
    increased to 8192x8192.
  * Centered text was changed to left-justified when flipped horizontally
    inside a compound object.
  * With -v option, after reporting the version, xfig would say that -v
    was an unknown option 
  * Local locale was being used when writing the xfig cut buffer file
    instead of switching to "C" locale.  This created commas instead of
    decimal (.) for numbers in those particular locales.
    From Dirk Osswald 
  * Local locale was used when forming command for calling fig2dev,
    resulting in commas instead of decimals for floating point numbers.
  * count_user_colors buffer overflow fixed
  * Under Cygwin, temporary file stayed around after unlink(), causing
    error when importing more than one ps/eps/pdf file
  * Segfault when using -update because appres resources were NULL
  * -update option failed when not first option passed to xfig
  * Clicking window manager "close window" button in library titlebar
    didn't close the window
  * Wasn't distributing objects in compounds when there were only 2 objects
  * Some compilers complain about the order of declaration in u_fonts.h - fixed
  * Northern part of map of India was incorrect (Libraries/Maps/Asia/india.fig)
  * Map of Serbia was misnamed "yugoslavia.fig" (Libraries/Maps/Europe/yugoslavia.fig)
  * Map of Central Europe had old Yugoslavia instead of Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-
    Herzegovina, and Macedonia (also, Slovenia was mistakenly inside the border)
  * Editing a compound object with more than 200 texts would crash xfig
  * Added note to README and FAQ html file:
    If the Xaw or Xaw3d Athena widget sets are compiled with the
    ARROW_SCROLLBAR style of scrollbars, there is no StartScroll action
    and you won't be able to scroll using the wheel on the mouse.  
    If you want to be able to scroll using the wheel, you must recompile
    the Xaw library from sources, disabling the ARROW_SCROLLBAR option.
  * Astrological symbols for planets in Miscellaneous/Astrology by Andrew Collier
  * Added key bindings to text dialogs to be more like modern systems (the
    Athena Widget Set that xfig uses is very old):
      Home:  beginning-of-line
      End:   end-of-line
      Del:   delete-character-right
  * Added *.jpeg* to picture browse options
  * New libraries for electronics from Fabio González in
    Libraries/Electronics/Schematic/More 
  * typo in latex_and_xfig.html and LATEX_AND_XFIG files. Text should be:

    (http://www.visi.com/~hawkeyd/xaw3d.html)
  * When loading a library object, if it contained only a compound and
    nothing else, when xfig promoted that compound to the toplevel the
    main comment was lost
  * Incorrect header files used for SmeBSB resulted in either segfault or
    none of the command panel entries being underlined
  * Drawing very large splines (e.g. at zoom = 0.01) caused integer
    roundoff errors, making xfig loop indefinitely
  * Bug where a line that had a zero width or length arrowhead was not
    redrawn after being moved, copied, canvas redraw, etc.
  * The page border and axis lines would obscure Fig objects when moving,
    copying etc. other objects on the canvas.
  * In the popup picture editor, if the relative position of the corners
    of the picture were changed, the rotation field was not updated
    (this bug was in 3.2.5-alpha3 only)
  * line, arc, ellipse length tool was reporting 0 length
  * URL for information about the color optimization code (written by
    Anthony Dekker) has changed to:
    http://members.ozemail.com.au/~dekker/NEUQUANT.HTML
  * -autorefresh command-line option (resource: Fig.autorefresh) which
    will make xfig look at the timestamp on the .fig file and
    automatically load it and display it everytime it changes.
  * Removed requirement to compile with WHEELMOUSE when using wheelmouse
  * New tower computers (Libraries/Computers/AOpenKF45E.fig and
    AOpenKF45E.fig from Dirko van Schalkwyk)
  * New 10/100 8port hub (Libraries/Networks/3Com3C16750.fig also from

  * For attribute popup dialogs with only one text entry, keyboard now
    focuses on the entry as long as the pointer is anywhere in the dialog
  * When using the "Open compound, keep rest visible", the other objects
    are drawn in shades of gray similar to the inactive layers feature.

    selection, offset, centering and orientation options
  * New library object "atom" in Libraries/Miscellaneous is the classic
    drawing of an atom with electrons circling
    From Andrew B. Collier
  * Missing #ifdef XAW3D in SimpleMenu.c
  * Bug when breaking a compound object - depths were added twice to the
    counts
  * When implicitly cancelling the placement of a library object by
    choosing another mode, xfig would do one of two things:
      1. tell user to cancel or finish the current operation, but there
         was no way to do that
      2. create the object that was being cancelled with extremely large,
         negative coordinates
  * Picture Reread button was active before file was read the first time
  * Rereading picture in edit popup produced bad colors
  * When using multiple copies of an imported picture, h/w ratio was not
    computed for copies
  * Importing PCX images were incorrect when bytes per line different from
    width*bpp
  * When passed a filename containing a directory name for a Fig object
    library using -library_dir, and that directory only contains Fig files
    and no subdirectories with Fig files, xfig segfaulted
  * Several checks for memory allocation failure added to the library
    loading procs
  * Forgot to free allocated memory when return abnormally from loading
    libraries
  * Path length check in loading libraries fixed
  * Missing include for put_msg prototype in e_measeure.c

    international fontset)
  * Added SIGPIPE signal to ignore in case an external program dies when we're
    using pipes
  * Screen capture on an MSBFirst X server with 24/32 bits per pixel was
    incorrect.
  * Importing any image file on such a server was incorrect (bytes/bits
    reversed).
  * Reading GIF or PCX files on 24-bit server *and* on big-endian machine
    (e.g. Sparcstation) resulted in bytes being swapped and funny colors
  * Could popup unit dialog when drawing/editing objects
  * Embedded whitespace in filenames in recently loaded files weren't
    parsed properly (.xfigrc)
  * When pasting an object on the canvas, point positioning grid wasn't used
  * Bug when reading a compressed eps file (file handle was passed to open
    proc instead of name)
  * Minor grid spec used twice instead of minor/major when passed to fig2dev
  * Fixed conversions of export/print grid values when switching to/from
    metric, decimal or fraction
  * When loading or merging a file, xfig appended ".fig" to the name if
    there wasn't ".fig" in the name. Now it only appends ".fig" if there
    is no suffix (no ".").
  * When appending the ".fig" before the previous change, xfig would segfault
  * Libraries/Electronic/Schematic/transformer and transformer_ironcore
    aligned to 1/16" grid
  * Bugs in indicator panel display of text flags, dimension line params
    and arrow size params when cycling through settings with middle or
    right mouse button
  * Bug in callbacks for dimension line checkboxes that select actual
    length or user text
  * When exporting to Combined PDF/LaTeX it uses ".pdf" and ".pdf_t"
    suffixes because LaTeX doesn't recognize ".pdftex" as a PDF file
  * Better clipping around arrowheads on thick lines (lines that are
    thicker than the arrowhead is wide)
  * Checks for open splines of < 2 points when reading figure file and
    removes them
  * Clicking middle mouse button after creating first point of closed
    spline switched to freehand mode
  * Export panel sections would get messed up when changing export
    languages
  * Now checks whether scrollbars support StartScroll before trying to use
    it for the wheel scrolling.  When the Xaw widgets are compiled with
    ARROW_SCROLLBAR, there is no such action.
  * pstex_t export lacked border option (-b) to align LaTeX text when
    pstex figure specified border (also fixed in fig2dev)
  * Create one picture object with no filename, then create another and
    xfig crashed
  * Some bugs when freeing dimension line components
  * Bad choices for grid dot spacing in metric mode in the 5mm grid, and
    decimal inch mode in the 0.5 and 1.0 inch grids
  * -international flag missing from xfig.html and xfig.man docs
  * Added call to XsetLocaleModifiers() when initializing input method
    (-international mode only)
  * xfig was limiting arrowhead lengths to 50 pixels instead of 50 inches,
    and the width to 10 pixels instead of 10 inches.
  * edit panel for circles shouldn't have "angle" entry
  * edit panel wasn't allowing typing in of negative angles for text and
    ellipses
  * Objects were sometimes drawn with a wild point when zooming
  * Full path was being added to default export filename and wasn't
    changing when user changed directories
  * When drawing a box or rounded box with the "show line lengths" on, the
    sizes were in Fig units (1200ppi) instead of user units.
  * Spacing cedilla (ISO 0xB8 / octal 270) was missing from CompKeyDB file
  * Changing the units in the popup edit panel for a text object caused a
    segfault.
  * Rulers and grid didn't change scale when user scale was != 1.0.  Even
    though the message window showed the correct user scale when drawing
    objects, the rulers and grid still showed the unscaled values.
  * Axis lines through 0,0 now drawn after page border so it remains
    visible when there is a grid
  * Segfault if current directory was deleted after starting xfig
  * Positioning grid was set to "ANY" when editing a compound object,
    causing the original bounding box to be lost
  * Bug in arc drawing caused arcs to be drawn as circles at high zoom
  * Computing the area of a polygon larger than 38x38 inches overflowed
    calculation
  * Bug in bounds calculation for ellipses and circles that increased
    bounding box even with line width = 1
  * Limit on number of styles in a family wasn't checked
  * If all depths were turned off and any edit operation was attempted on
    the canvas such as move object, delete object, xfig would hang,
    searching for objects indefinitely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 22 18:28:57 CET 2002 - mfabian@suse.de

- use the URW fonts for display on X11 instead of bitmap fonts.
  Using the URW fonts for display on X11 *and* for printing with
  Ghostscript has the advantage that printout looks much more
  similar to the preview on X11. Much more WYSIWYG now.
  On top of that, the bitmap fonts could not be scaled anymore
  because we now have ":unscaled" added to every directory in
  the font path which contains only bitmap fonts. Therefore
  changing the font size in xfig ceased to work on X11, it worked
  only in the PostScript output. Because of this the X11 display
  was very different from the PostScript output.
- add font-test.fig as a sample file to test the correct display
  of the URW fonts.
- add xfig.3.2.3d-xim.dif to fix XIM for Japanese and Korean.
  (didn't work at all previously because a call to
  XSetLocaleModifiers() was missing)
- switch on the '-international' option for all locales using
  codesets different from 'ISO-8859-*' on by default.
- remove Korean app-defaults. The only reason for it's existence
  was to set 'Fig.international: true' apart from that it was
  identical to the standard app-defaults file. And because of
  some bug (which I still don't understand) it wasn't read anyway
  and therefore achieved nothing.
