  <title>Facility for Interactive Generation of Figures under the X Window System</title>
  <description>Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate
objects interactively in an X Window System window.  The resulting
pictures can be saved, printed on PostScript printers, or converted to
a variety of other formats (to allow inclusion in LaTeX documents, for
example).
