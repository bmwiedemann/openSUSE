  <title>XML Graphics Commons</title>
  <description>Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of 
several reusable components used by Apache Batik and 
Apache FOP. Many of these components can easily be used 
separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO. You will 
find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, 
Graphics2D implementations that let you generate PDF &amp; 
PostScript files, and much more.</description>
