%description
xbindkeys is a program that associates keys or mouse buttons to shell commands
under X. After a little configuration, it can start many commands with the
keyboard (e.g. control+alt+x starts an xterm) or with the mouse buttons.

%if !%{with guile}
guile support is disabled in this package.
To enable guile support, rebuild the src.rpm and pass --with guile
to rpmbuild.
