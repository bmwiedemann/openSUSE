#
# Setting it to "xim" is a reasonable setting together with
# XMODIFIERS="@im=local" because Compose support then works exactly
# as defined in the X11 Compose file.
#
# But this still causes problems when saving files
# with non-ASCII characters in the file name from acroread 8.x because
# xim support in acroread 8.x is very buggy
# (see http://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=370330)
#
# Apart from problems in acroread, xim is generally
# known to be quite buggy. Therefore a better choice is probably
# GTK_IM_MODULE=cedilla. This changes 6 Compose key sequences to
# produce U+00C7 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA) and
# LATIN_SMALL_LETTER_C_WITH_CEDILLA which produce 
# U+00E7 (LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA) instead of
# U+0106 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH ACUTE) and
# U+0107 (LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH ACUTE).
# Most users won’t notice that small change, and for those who do notice
# it is probably even useful.
# For details see  http://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=413879#c27
