  <title>A keyboard indicator and switcher</title>
  <description>The xxkb program is a keyboard layout switcher and indicator. Unlike the programs that reload keyboard maps and use their own hot-keys, xxkb is a simple GUI for XKB (X KeyBoard extension) and just sends commands to and accepts events from XKB. That means that it will work with the existing setup of your X Server without any modifications.</description>
