  <title>cute little penguins that walk along the tops of your windows</title>
  <description>This program animates a friendly family of penguins on your root
window. They drop in from the top of the screen, walk along the tops of
your windows, up the sides of your windows, up the side of the screen,
and sometimes even levitate with their genetically-modified
go-go-gadget 'copter ability.</description>
