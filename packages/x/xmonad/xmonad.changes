- Update xmonad to version 0.14.2.
  ## unknown (unknown)

  ## 0.14.1 (August 20, 2018)

  ### Breaking Changes

    * The cabal build no longer installs xmonad.hs, xmonad.1, and xmonad.1.html
      as data files. The location cabal picks for chose files isn't useful as
      standard tools like man(1) won't find them there. Instead, we rely on
      distributors to pick up the files from the source tarball during the build
      and to install them into proper locations where their users expect them.
      [https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/pull/127]

  ### Bug Fixes

    * Add support for GHC 8.6.x by providing an instance for 'MonadFail X'. A
      side effect of that change is that our code no longer compiles with GHC
      versions prior to 8.0.x. We could work around that, no doubt, but the
      resulting code would require CPP and Cabal flags and whatnot. It feels more
      reasonable to just require a moderately recent compiler instead of going
      through all that trouble.

    * xmonad no longer always recompile on startup. Now it only does so if the
      executable does not have the name that would be used for the compilation
      output. The purpose of recompiling and executing the results in this case is
      so that the `xmonad` executable in the package can be used with custom
      configurations.

  ### Enhancements

    * Whenever xmonad recompiles, it now explains how it is attempting to
      recompile, by outputting logs to stderr. If you are using xmonad as a custom
      X session, then this will end up in a `.xsession-errors` file.
