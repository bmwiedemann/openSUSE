- U_Use-DRM_CAP_CURSOR_WIDTH-HEIGHT-if-possible.patch
  * There's no need to hardcode the cursor size if the kernel can
    report the value it wants. Fixes invisible cursor issue on
    RDNA3 cards like Navi31/RX 7900 Series cards. (boo#1207388)

- Update to version 19.0.0
  * Support for FreeSync variable refresh rate (this also requires the
    amdgpu driver from kernel 5.0 or newer, and radeonsi from Mesa 19.0 or
    newer).
  * Various TearFree related fixes and robustness improvements.

Sat Sep 15 13:53:27 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 18.1.0
  * This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.20.
  * When using DC as of Linux 4.17:
    - Support advanced colour management functionality.
    - Support gamma correction and X11 colormaps when Xorg runs at depth
      30 as well.
  * Support for leasing RandR outputs to clients.
  * Various robustness fixes for TearFree. In particular, fixed several
    cases in which disabling TearFree at runtime would result in the Xorg
    process freezing or crashing.
  * Fixed some m4 related build issues with older versions of autotools.

- fixed damageproto BuildRequires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 12:40:11 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 18.0.1
  * This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.19. It also works
    with xserver 1.20 RC1, so unless something unexpected happens,
    it should work with xserver 1.20 as well.
    This is a bug-fix release addressing issues in 18.0.0. While
    those issues shouldn't affect most users, I recommend that all
    users of 18.0.0 update to 18.0.1.
    + The Xorg process could enter an infinite loop after a server
      reset (in configurations where Xorg doesn't terminate when
      the last client disconnects)
    + The Xorg process could crash when multiple primary screens
      are configured in xorg.conf.
    + TearFree could trigger debugging messages in the pixman
      library

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 14:41:29 UTC 2018 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 18.0.0
  "I'm pleased to announce the 18.0.0 release of xf86-video-amdgpu, the
   Xorg driver for AMD Radeon GPUs supported by the amdgpu kernel driver.
   This release supports xserver versions 1.13-1.19. It also works with
   xserver 1.20 RC1, so unless something unexpected happens, it should work
   with xserver 1.20 as well.
   Highlights:
   * New year-based versioning scheme
   * Page flipping can now be used even when the HW cursor can't be used in
     some cases
   * Support for 30-bit RGB colour output. Note that gamma correction is
     currently not available with 30-bit colour. Also, hardware
     acceleration is not available with 30-bit colour with xserver versions
     before 1.20.
   Plus other improvements and fixes. Thanks to everybody who contributed
   to this release in any way!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 12 13:44:43 UTC 2017 - msrb@suse.com

- Remove build dependency on Mesa-devel. The only part of it needed
  is libgbm-devel and that is already BuildRequired by
  'pkgconfig(gbm)'. Added explicit damageproto-devel dependency
  which was before pulled in by Mesa-devel. Mesa-devel is too
  general and is a bottleneck in distribution build. (bnc#1071297)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  8 08:57:42 UTC 2017 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * Clients can now use DRI page flipping even while TearFree is enabled
  for any CRTC. This should improve performance of such clients
  (including compositing managers) while TearFree is enabled, and avoid
  other issues such as tearing on other CRTCs where TearFree isn't
  enabled.
  * The driver now takes measures to prevent other DRM master processes
  (potentially from other local users) from accessing buffers created by
  this driver while switched away to a different VT. Other DRM master
  processes should only be able to access a single buffer anymore, which
  contains only all-black pixels.
  * The gamma ramp is now applied to the HW cursor as well, so the HW
  cursor doesn't look odd when e.g. using Redshift or similar tools.
  * Plus other improvements and fixes. Thanks to everybody who contributed
  to this release in any way!

    to release 1.0.0, we're on 1.3.0 meanwhile)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 16 11:57:28 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 1.3.0:
  * Allow TearFree to be toggled at runtime via an RandR output
    property "TearFree". The xorg.conf option "TearFree" now
    controls the default value of the output properties.
  * Use libdrm_amdgpu functionality to determine the GPU marketing
    name, remove corresponding tables from this driver.
  * Use DRM render nodes for DRI3 clients when available.
  * Plus many other improvements and fixes.

  The only change in this release is a fix for issues with the configure option
  --with-xorg-conf-dir which slipped into the 1.1.1 release.
- Packaging changes:
  + Check the signature for the driver release, as other drivers already do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 21:46:51 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  + Use --with-xorg-conf-dir=$prefix/share/X11/xorg.conf.d by
    default.
  + Fix cursor size for SI.
  + Add SI PCI IDs.
  + Add missing Kaveri PCI ID (1318).
  + Add Mullins PCI IDs (fdo#97472).
  + DRI2: Fix amdgpu_dri2_exchange_buffers width/height
    copy'n'paste error.
  + DRI2: Add interpolated_vblanks in amdgpu_dri2_get_crtc_msc.
  + Only use RandR APIs if RandR is enabled (deb#827984).
  + Destroy all dedicated scanout buffers during CloseScreen.
  + glamor: Reallocate linear pixmap BO if necessary for DRI2
    PRIME.
  + Move DRI2's local fixup_glamor helper to
    amdgpu_glamor_set_pixmap_bo v2 so it can be used outside of the
    DRI2 code.
  + Consolidate get_drawable_pixmap helper.
  + Add amdgpu_pixmap_get_tiling_info.
  + Remove amdgpu_share_pixmap_backing.

- amdgpu.ids: added new PCI IDs supported by driver release 1.1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  7 19:07:08 UTC 2016 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- update to 1.1.0
* Support for the upcoming Polaris family of GPUs.
* Option "TearFree" can now prevent tearing with rotation/reflection as
  well (with Xorg >= 1.16).
* RandR CRTC transforms now work correctly (but for now still exhibit
  tearing even with TearFree).
* The RandR 1.4 provider name is now no longer hardcoded to "amdgpu"
  but constructed from the GPU chipset name and bus ID, allowing
  several GPUs supported by this driver to be distinguished by name.
* The RandR primary output is now always explicitly marked as such.
* The driver can prevent clients trying to use the DRI3 extension over a
  display connection forwarded via SSH from hanging.
* VDPAU/OpenGL interoperation can now work with DRI3 enabled.
* Many more fixes for issues using the DRI3/Present extensions.
* Plus many other small improvements and fixes. Thanks to everybody who
	contributed to this release in any way!* 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Don't advertise any PRIME offloading capabilities without acceleration
* Load fb module before glamoregl/shadow modules
* HAS_DIRTYTRACKING_ROTATION also supports multiple CRTCs
* Check for NULL koutput in drmmode_output_dpms

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 09:02:22 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- update to release 1.0.0
  This is the initial release of the xf86-video-amdgpu driver.
  It was forked from the xf86-video-ati radeon driver and modified to
  support the amdgpu kernel driver via libdrm_amdgpu, and by extension
  the latest AMD GPU families Tonga, Carrizo, Iceland, Fiji and Stoney.
  Some functionality was removed because it's not relevant for the GPUs
  supported by the amdgpu kernel driver, but other than that the two
  drivers are more or less on par with respect to functionality and bug
  fixes.
  Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release!
- get rid of _service file (no longer needed with official release
  now being available)
