Wed Sep 13 06:14:39 UTC 2023 - Nikolay Gueorguiev <nikolay.gueorguiev@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version 4.3ga (jsc#PED-3355)
* Improvements
* 4.3beta2
  - Builds now work on MSYS2 MinGW.
  - The ibm_hosts file is now case-insensitive. (Request from Drew Derbyshire)
  - The underscoreBlankFill resource can now be set to false to prevent trailing 
  underscore characters in a field from being treated like blanks when inserting 
  in blank fill mode.
  - Changed the keymap for Alt-q in x3270, c3270 and wc3270 to exit the emulator 
  unconditionally, using Quit(-force).
* 4.3alpha1
  - The x3270 Color scheme menu option has been renamed 3279 color scheme, since 
  it only applies to 3279 mode. The green-screen color scheme option has been removed, 
  though the resource behind it (x3270.colorScheme.GreenScreen) remains. 
  The default 3279 color scheme now has a grey10 background to make it easier to see 
  with minimal window frames.
  - The confDir resource, where the ibm_hosts file is found, can now be displayed by the 
  Set() action.
  - Added Alt-e to the default wc3270 keymap and Ctrl-a, f to the c3270 default keymap for 
  the EraseEOF() action. This is needed because Windows no longer passes the END key to 
  console applications.
  - Added the ability to save printer output to a file in a particular directory, 
  either by specifying the directory path as the printer name (on Windows) or 
  by specifying the new prtodir command as the printing command (on POSIX).
  - Added support for growing or shrinking the x3270 emulator font using Ctrl-+ and Ctrl--.
  - Added the IBM 3270 fonts from Ricardo Bánffy to the wc3270 installation and added the 
  ability to specify fonts in the wc3270 Session Wizard.
  - Changed the default behavior of the terminal type reported in TN3270 mode for 
  3279 models 4 and 5. Previous versions reported these as IBM-3279-4-E and 
  IBM-3279-5-E respectively; now they are reported as IBM-3278-4-E and 
  IBM-3278-5-E because the other names are often not recognized by hosts. 
  To restore the previous behavior, set the wrongTerminalName resource to true. 
  (Note that the model resource still refers to these models as 3279-4-E and 3279-5-E; 
  this only changes what is reported to the host.)
  - Changed the default library for TLS on macOS to OpenSSL.
  - Added a summary of warnings to the end of the output from the ./configure script.
  - Added a Python-based test target (documentation coming soon).
  - Added a BUILDCC variable to the ./configure script, to facilitate cross-compilation. 
  (Original suggested patch by Thorsten Otto.)
  - The code can now be built on POSIX without the <langinfo.h> header file or the 
  nl_langinfo() library function being present. It will guess the codeset (encoding) 
  from the LC_CTYPE or LANG environment variable if present, or default to ASCII if 
  neither is present or the value is not defined as locale.encoding. 
  (Original suggested patch by Thorsten Otto.)
* Bug fixes
* 4.3ga3
  - When there is an error making a connection in s3270, the error message is 
  no longer output on two lines. (Bug report)
* 4.3beta2
  - When using a printer session and TLS, the printer session no longer 
  fails with a host certificate validation error.
  - When inserting in blank fill mode, trailing underscores are no longer consumed, 
  unless they are at the end of the field. (Bug report) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 31 11:18:17 UTC 2023 - Nikolay Gueorguiev <nikolay.gueorguiev@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version 4.2ga10 (jsc#PED-3355)
- Bug fixes
  * 4.2ga10
    - TN3270E NVT mode now works properly.
    - TN3270E SSCP-LU mode now works even if BIND-IMAGE has not been 
      negotiated by the host.
    - When TN3270E is turned off and back on within a session, 
      x3270 now renegotiates functions properly.
  * 4.2ga9
    - x3270 mouse selections are much more predictable. 
    - Double- and triple-clicks no longer move the cursor.
    - x3270 no longer crashes when it is reconfigured 
      (model, font, etc.) while the floating pop-up keypad is visible.
    - The security indicator in x3270 no longer disappears when it is 
      indicating unverified state and the window is reconfigured.
    - The ./configure option to give an alternate location for the 
      OpenSSL library (--with-openssl=) works correctly again.
  * 4.2ga8
    - When pasting in NVT mode and the text wraps to the next line, 
      the cursor no longer ends up in the wrong location.
    - The x3270a script no longer causes a spurious Invalid (empty) 
      hostname error pop-up when the display's DPI is other than 96.
  * 4.2ga7
    - The wc3270 Session Wizard no longer exits silently when 
      it encounters an error.
    - x3270 will no longer change fonts unnecessarily when the 
      host code page is changed. (bug report)
    - The background color is now propagated correctly by the RA order.
    - In a resource file, a resource value can now end with a 
      properly-quoted backslash, without the backslash being interpreted 
      as a line continuation.
    - The Transfer() action, when invoked from within a file read by the 
      Source() action, now blocks properly -- it returns once the 
      file transfer is complete.
    - If the Source() action is aborted, it will no longer leave the 
      keyboard locked.
    - Typeahead is now processed correctly when the host has 
      negotiated TN3270E Contention Resolution and the unlockDelay 
      resource is set to false. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  9 17:26:21 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- x3270 4.2ga6:
  * many improvements, bug fixes and feature extensions
  * pr3287 now supports -tracefile
  * pr3287 can now try more than one address for a host
  * hostname lookups can now be limited to IPv4/IPv6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  1 11:10:02 UTC 2022 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to current stable release 4.1 ga13:
  * Added a macros menu to c3270 and wc3270.
  * Corrected support for the macros resource without a qualifying host name.
  * The entire list of command-line options is now displayed only
    with the --help command-line option, not for every unknown option.
  * Changed the default for unlockDelay in all emulators from
    true to false. This is a very significant change.
  * When input from the String() action overflows a field,
    the cursor now lands in the correct location.
  * When a host has multiple addresses, the emulators (except pr3287)
    will now reliably try up to four of them.
  * Errors from the OpenSSL library are now displayed correctly.
  * When a connection fails to a TLS-tunnel host (one specified with
    the L: prefix), the correct error message is now displayed.
  * Fixed a c3270 crash when a connection is opened from a remote
    source (HTTP server or script port) while at the c3270> prompt.
  * Fixed a c3270 crash when the -secure and -trace command-line
    options are used together.
  * A key typed into a full field in insert mode no longer overwrites
    the character under the cursor.
- Drop upstream resolved patches:
  * x3270-missing-file.patch
  * x3270-missing-include.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 31 13:18:05 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Use https for URL and Source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 20:03:25 UTC 2021 - Predrag Ivanović <predivan@mts.rs>

- Update to ga14 of 4.0 series:
  * The scripting infrastructure has been rewritten and renamed to
    task engine. 
    * No artificial dependencies between actions initiated by
     different sources.
    * Accidental blocking behavior has been eliminated.
    * Unrelated operations are now properly concurrent
  * A new emulator has been created, b3270, as a common back-end
    process that handles the 3270 protocol and host interactions,
    using a simple XML-based protocol.
  * The c3270 prompt has been generalized and is available to all
    of the 3270 emulators as the x3270 prompt.
    * The prompt now uses color to distinguish error messages.
  * APL keyboard operation on x3270 has changed, fixed APL keymap
    was removed in favor of key combination Shift-Escape toggling
    a new APL mode
  * Many other bug fixes and features
- Removed x3270-handle-missing-font.patch, mkversion.patch, and
  reproducible.patch, merged upstream.
- Expat added as its BuildRequires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 11 22:21:36 UTC 2021 - Mark Post <mpost@suse.com>

- Added x3270-handle-missing-font.patch (bsc#1177104)
  In some cases when fonts are present locally but are not present
  in the fontpath, x3270 can crash due to a segfault caused by
  XLoadQueryFont() returning NULL in lff_single().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 07:28:01 UTC 2020 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

- Add reproducible.patch to override build date (boo#1047218)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 17 18:29:55 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- x3270 3.r6ga12:
  * Potentially incompatible changes:
    + Removed explicit support for self-signed host certificates.
    + To allow self-signed certificates, disable verification.
    + Switched to verifying host certficates by default. This can
      be disabled by using the -noverifycert opton or by setting
      the verifyHostCert resource to false.
  * Many bug fixes and minor feature additions
- drop reproducible.patch, x3270-fix-build.patch, upstreamed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  5 11:59:49 UTC 2019 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- x3270-fix-build.patch: fixed a bug triggered by LTO, commented
  out incompat definition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 14 12:41:10 UTC 2018 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- Add mkversion.patch to have fixed timestamps (boo#1047218)
- Add reproducible.patch to not add timestamps in .gz header

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 28 10:14:48 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to ga9 of 3.5 series:
  * [x3270] Fixed the toggle names saved with the File->Save
    Changed Options menu option and when processing the
    WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message.
  * [x3270] Explicitly test for X11, Xt, Xmu and Xaw header files
    and libraries in the configure script.
  * [x3270] Put the dryrun script in the object directory.
  * [wc3270] Allow Windows VKey codes to be specified in wc3270
    keymaps in hexadecimal with the syntax VKEY-0xnn. This allows
    unknown VKeys to be specified. The same syntax is used in
    traces.
  * [x3270] Fixed an issue where parameters beyond the second were
    ignored in many keymap actions.
  * [all] Fixed an issue with the Abort action called from scripts.
  * [all Windows] Always find root_certs.txt in the same directory
    as the executable, if not installed.
  * [all] Validate the parameters to the Transfer() action better.
  * [pr3287] Fix the configure script so it properly detects
    missing OpenSSL header files, even if the OpenSSL library is
    present.
  * [all] Limit DFT buffer size to 32767. 32768 causes the host to
    send 0-byte buffers.
  * [x3270] Dropped support for xmkmf and imake. x3270 builds and
    installs only using autoconf paths now.
  * see http://x3270.bgp.nu/documentation-relnotes.html for more
    detailed list of changes
- Drop no longer needed pr3270-memleak.patch
- Cleanup spec file with spec-cleaner
- Make sure that optflags are used in building

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  9 01:33:07 UTC 2016 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added desktop file
- split up font reconfigure macro into the pieces so we can add the
  desktop file macros too

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 11:07:52 UTC 2016 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to ga10 of 3.4 series:

  * [s3270] Fixed an x3270if build problem when libiconv is needed.
  * [all] Fixed a problem with truncating the list of LUs when connecting to a
    host.
  * [all] Fixed a crash when too many parameters are passed to an action in a macro
    or script.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Fixed binary file transfer bug.
  * [x3270] Fixed missing 'Not Connected' message when disconnecting from a host.
  * [all] Fixed trace display of incoming IPv6 connections and the parsing of the
    x3270 -scriptport option.
  * [tcl3270] Added tcl3270 support for Tcl 8.6.
  * [all] Renamed $INSTALL variable in the top-level configure script (bugs:15).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 12:09:58 UTC 2015 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version bump to 3.4:
  * Recreated tarball and build approach so adapt our system
  * Fixed a number of warnings found by the MacOS C compiler, which turned out
    to be real issues.
  * [all] Synchronize the ReadBuffer action with the Wait(Output) action, just
    like Ascii and Ebcdic.
  * [all] Fixed an NVT-mode emulation problem.
  * [all] Fixed a synchronization issue with scripts and file transfers.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Fixed a crash when the Transfer action was called from a
    script.
  * [x3270] Fixed a crash when visible control characters are turned on in
    3278 mode.
  * [pr3287] Changed the pr3287 Makefile to use $INSTALL_DATA (bugs:#13).
  * [All Unix] Added -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE wherever a Makefile used -D_BSD_SOURCE,
    to get rid of compiler warnings with newer versions of glibc (bugs:#12).
  * [x3270, c3270, wc3270] Corrected the OIA display of save-to-printer pages.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Made the help for file-transfer reflect the current
    defaults. Added help for Keymap.
  * [wc3270] Fixed the pager at the wc3270> prompt. Now it adapts to the size
    of the console window correctly.
  * [pr3287, wpr3287] Fixed a problem with printer session start-up when both
    a specific printer LU and an SSL tunnel (L:) are specified.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Added a Keymap action to add or remove temporary keymaps.
    The semantics are the same as the x3270 action of the same name.
  * [all] Made the parameter to ResumeScript optional, and relaxed the
    restrictions on when PauseScript can be used, so it can now be used from
    macros and command files read with the Source action.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Allow the DFT buffer size to be changed in the c3270/wc3270
    file transfer dialog.
  * [c3270, wc3270] Allow file transfers to be interrupted with Ctrl-C.
  * [x3270] Fixed an issue where the terminal type would not be reported to the
    host as IBM-DYNAMIC if the screen was put into oversize mode via a menu
    selection (it was correct if oversize came from a resource). Also made sure
    that the 'About->Configuration' display of the terminal type is always
    correct.
  * [all] Added resources to define the default values for each of the IND$FILE
    file transfer parameters. The resources have the same names as the Transfer
    action keywords, with ft prepended. E.g., the Mode default is controlled by
    the ftMode resource. For consistency, deprecated dftBufferSize and
    ftCodePage in favor of ftBufferSize and ftWindowsCodePage (the old
    resources are still available).
  * [all] Added missing functionality to specify the size for avblock TSO file
    allocations in IND$FILE file transfers.
  * [x3270] Added an aplCircledAlpha resource to allow x3270 to properly
    display APL underscored uppercase letters with the APL385 font, by
    translating them to the (nonstandard) Unicode circled-alphabetic range
    U+24B6 to U+25CF.
  * [x3270, c3270, wc3270] Overhauled visible control characters so that field
    attributes are completely decoded. Field attributes are now in underlined
    yellow in x3270. Added visible control character support to c3270 (also
    underlined yellow) and wc3270 (reverse-video yellow), with a menu option.
  * [all] Overhauled the build structure. Now there are libraries for common
    functions.
  * [wc3270] Mapped Alt-left-click onto a lightpen select operation. Added a
    lightPenPrimary resource to switch this, so that an unmodified left-click
    is a lightpen select and Alt-left-click is a cursor move or copy/paste
    highlight.
  * [all] Added a B: prefix option to hostnames to disable the automatic
    keyboard unlock when a BIND-IMAGE is received.
  * [all] Added an -nvt option and an nvtMode resource to force NVT mode as
    soon as a session is connected. This overrides the usual behavior of
    locking the keyboard and waiting for the host to send NVT-mode data or
    negotiate 3270 mode before unlocking. This option also changes the default
    terminal type to xterm.
  * [c3270] Added a mapping from the Escape key to the Escape() action
    (breaking to the c3270> prompt).
  * [x3270] Added a maxRecent resource to control the maximum size of the
    recent host list in the Connect menu.
  * [all] Allow the -scriptport option to specify an address to listen on.
  * [all] Added webserver support. The -httpd option starts a webserver
    listening on the specified port. The webserver supports a REST API and
    some basic HTML objects.
  * [all] Removed configurability of tracing, NVT mode, TN3270E support,
    scripting, menus file transfer, the x3270 pop-up keypad and printer
    sessions (they're always enabled now).
  * [x3270, wc3270] Added an overlayPaste toggle. When set, pasting over a
    protected field will simply increment the cursor position instead of
    locking the keyboard. This allows forms to be copied and pasted with the
    protected fields included. Setting this toggle also implicitly sets the
    marginedPaste toggle.
  * [x3270] Changed the selection logic so that a rectangular selection
    (the default for 3270 mode) never ends with a newline character.
- Refresh patches:
  * mknod.patch
  * pr3270-memleak.patch
