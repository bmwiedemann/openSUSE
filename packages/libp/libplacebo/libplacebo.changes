Sun Jun 14 15:37:17 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to version 2.72.0
This is a major release with several key additions, most notably
being the support for custom, mpv-style "user shaders" (.hook),
giving us access to a large variety of pre-existing user shaders
such as RAVU, FSRCNNX, Anime4K, SSimSuperRes, KrigBilateral,
NNEDI3, and more.

In addition to this, major additions include a completely
refactored and fixed AV1 grain generation shader, support for
Vulkan versions higher than 1.0, support for GPU-based timers,
and improved interop APIs for both Vulkan and OpenGL, and new
and improved aspect ratio handling.

Finally, this release also brings with it a major change to the way
HDR and SDR content are mapped between each other, including a new
tone-mapping function based on the industry-standard
ITU-R BT.2390 EETF.

Additions:
  * add pl_swapchain_hdr_metadata, to set HDR metadata on supported
    swapchains (currently only vulkan with VK_EXT_hdr_metadata)
  * add support for vulkan versions higher than 1.0, communicated
    via the new fields api_version and max_api_version
  * add support for GPU-assisted validation and best practices
    layers, via the new field pl_vk_inst_params.debug_extra
  * add helper functions for working with pl_rects, including new
    aspect ratio handling helpers (pl_rect2df_aspect_*)
  * add field pl_vulkan_params.device_uuid to allow choosing the
    vulkan device by its UUID
  * add function pl_vulkan_hold_raw, to hold images without
    actually transitioning its layout and access mode
  * add function pl_vulkan_import, to allow directly re-using an
    existing VkDevice rather than creating a new one; this requires
    communicating metadata about how the device was created
  * add field pl_vulkan_params.features to allow loading optional
    extra device features at device creation time
  * add support for mpv-style custom user shaders (.hook),
    using the set of functions in <libplacebo/shaders/custom.h>
  * add pl_render_high_quality_params, enabling debanding and
    EWA scaling
  * add pl_timer GPU resource type and associated API functions,
    allowing the GPU execution time of shaders and texture transfer
    operations to be measured directly
  * add PL_SHADER_SIG_SAMPLER, allowing generated sampling shaders
    to directly accept the sampler to use as function parameters
  * add pl_image_set_chroma_location to automatically apply the
    correct chroma location to any subsampled planes
  * add PL_TONE_MAPPING_BT_2390, a tone mapping function based on
    the EETF from ITU-R Report BT.2390 (and make it the default)
  * add pl_peak_detect_params.overshoot_margin to help combat
    clipping on certain types of rapid scene fade-ins
  * add pl_sampler_type to allow encoding non-standard sampler
    types such as sampler2DRect, and also generalize samplers to
    allow e.g. usampler2D or isampler3D
  * add pl_opengl_wrap and pl_opengl_unwrap, to allow directly
    mapping between OpenGL textures and the pl_tex abstraction

Changes:
  * deprecate pl_image.width/height, which are now inferred
    automatically from the actual planes
  * pl_vulkan_wrap now takes a pl_vulkan_wrap_params struct
    instead of directly accepting its parameters, including new
    fields sample_mode and address_mode to configure the created
    sampler
  * change pl_dispatch_compute to allow optionally passing in a
    simulated framebuffer width/height, which will be used to
    translate vertex attributes (if any)
  * undefine disabled config.h features, instead of defining them
    as 0
  * remove debanding from pl_render_default_params
  * refactor HDR<->SDR mapping; PL_COLOR_REF_WHITE has been removed
    and replaced by PL_COLOR_SDR_WHITE (203 cd/m^2)
    and PL_COLOR_SDR_WHITE_HLG (75% HLG), respectively
  * completely refactor pl_shader_av1_grain`, which now samples
    directly from the passed texture rather than requiring the
    color be pre-sampled
  * pl_render_image now infers the image primaries based on
    resolution, rather than always hard-coding
    PL_COLOR_SPACE_UNKNOWN as BT.709
  * change pl_render_target.dst_rect from pl_rect2d to pl_rect2df,
    allowing more accurate aspect ratio handling, and correctly
    compensate for subpixel scaling ratios
  * require python3-mako as a dependency of the vulkan feature
  * pl_chroma_location_offset now treats PL_CHROMA_UNKNOWN as
    PL_CHROMA_LEFT, the de-facto standard chroma location
  * the default value of pl_color_map_params.tone_mapping_algo
    is now PL_TONE_MAPPING_BT_2390

Fixes and performance improvements:
  * fix shader generation when the GLSL version is explicitly
    overridden
  * properly mark some shader failures (pl_shader_is_failed)
  * fix texture invalidation on OpenGL
  * correctly respect pl_swapchain_frame.flipped in
    pl_render_target_from_swapchain
  * correctly validate descriptor uniqueness in pl_pass_create
  * skip redundant matrix multiplication in pl_shader_encode_color
    wherever possible
  * work around driver bugs w.r.t out-of-order buffer offsets by
    sorting all buffer variables by offset
  * fix edge cases in vulkan swapchain usage flag checks
  * fix excessive CPU usage in pl_tex_download
  * reduce the number of unnecessary GPU flushes caused by
    pl_buf_poll
  * fix issue where blending did not work on some drivers
    (e.g. nvidia)
  * make the framebuffer discard check more aggressive
  * fix computation of anti-aliased resizable orthogonal filters,
    e.g. when downscaling using pl_filter_lanczos
  * fix external image memory barriers for exclusive mode images
  * fix failure path of pl_swapchain_submit_frame
  * fix various GLSL compatibility issues with av1 grain generation
  * reduce maximum vulkan memory allocation slab size to conform to
    AMD recommendations
  * fix build error when lcms is not available
  * fix double-application of texture scale for e.g.
    10-bit content when using separable scalers
  * fix a multitude of bugs affecting av1 grain generation,
    especially for chroma planes
  * fix segfault on vulkan device oom
  * fix invalid shader generation on some platforms
  * fix a multitude of bugs, edge cases and subtle off-by-ones
    related to chroma scaling and plane alignment
  * add fallback code for edge case w.r.t chroma scaling and gpu
    resource exhaustion
  * correctly load VK_KHR_swapchain in all circumstances that
    require accessing its functions
  * minimize fbo usage inside pl_renderer, by re-using unused fbos
  * tweak the work group size for polar scaling to perform better
    on modern GPUs (tested on RDNA)
  * transparently upgrade fragment shaders to compute shaders on
    environments with async compute
  * pick a more reasonable size for the dummy gpu's
    max_group_threads
  * forbid 10-bit linear transfer functions from vulkan swapchains
  * fix segfault when re-executing previously failed shaders
  * fix swapchain creation errors on GLES 2
  * explicitly mark all shader resources as non-aliased
  * correctly specify shader storage buffers as coherent for
    shaders that require them
  * fix various memory barrier synchronization issues for opengl

Wed May  6 04:56:38 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to version 2.43.1
This release backports a number of bug fixes from master affecting
the v2.43.0 release, and also slightly extends the range of
backwards compatibility with respect to vulkan-headers versions.
(This change is not on master, so this can be seen as a
compatibility release)

  * fix GLSL version checks when overriding GLSL versions with
    pl_shader_params.glsl
  * fix minor order-of-operations issue in AV1 grain synthesis
  * fix glInvalidate* backwards compatibility issue
  * fix compilation with older vulkan-headers (e.g. ubuntu 18.04)
  * fix a bug where pl_shader_encode_color sometimes uploaded and

  * work around upstream issues with MSL shader compilation by
    ensuring all buffer elements are sorted by offset
  * fix hypothetical edge case with swapchain image usages
    forbidden by the swapchain image format

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 23 00:10:37 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Add libepoxy to BuildRequires
- Enable test suite
- Update to version 2.43.0
The major highlight of this release is the introduction of a new
OpenGL backend, documented in <libplacebo/opengl.h>, which is also
the reason for the major version bump.

Apart from the addition of OpenGL support, this release brings with
it a large number of fixes for backwards compatibility with older
versions of GLSL and GLES, allowing libplacebo to be used to
generate legal shaders for virtually any GLSL version in existence.

Supporting these changes, the test framework has been expanded
considerably to allow for automated testing of older OpenGL context
versions and older GLSL versions.

Additions:
  * add pl_gpu.pci, containing the PCI address of the underlying
    GPU
  * add pl_image.av1_grain, allowing pl_renderer to add AV1 grain
  * add pl_opengl backend (see <libplacebo/opengl.h>)
  * add pl_color_levels_guess, to infer color levels from
    pl_color_repr
  * pl_shader_encode_color now handles non-linear color systems
  * add pl_render_params.force_dither, to force use of the dither
    code
  * add pl_render_params.disable_fbos, to forcibly disable FBOs
  * add pl_vk_inst_params.layers, to allow loading extra vulkan
    layers
  * add a way to restrict the maximum GLSL version provided by the
    various pl_gpu backends, for testing purposes

Changes:
  * load all vulkan function pointers indirectly, using a
    user-provided vkGetInstanceProcAddr function
  * vulkan can now be built without linking against libvulkan.so
  * refactor av1 grain data struct, splitting it up into
    "grain metadata" and "shader params"
  * pl_swapchain_resize now recreates suboptimal swapchains even
    if the size does not change
  * pl_tex_blit now requires the new cap PL_GPU_CAP_BLITTABLE_1D_3D
    for 1D/3D textures
  * pl_tex_params.host_readable now requires the new cap
    PL_FMT_CAP_HOST_READABLE on the chosen format
  * pl_vk_inst_create will now automatically load any layers needed
    for extensions specified by the user

Fixes and performance improvements:
  * make pl_color_adjustment.gamma actually do something
  * fix av1 grain shader for separated planes
  * fix memory corruption in pl_vulkan_swapchain_suboptimal
  * fix access mask on API writes to read-writable vulkan buffers
  * fix some instances of undefined behavior in av1 grain synthesis
  * fix av1 grain scale for PL_COLOR_LEVELS_UNKNOWN
  * fix use of local #include for config.h in installed headers
  * fix various incorrect literals for compatibility with older
    GLSL
  * fix potential type error in XYZ input handling
  * fix numerous backwards compatibility issues for older GLSL and
    GLES versions, across the board
  * quench some meson warnings, as well as some compiler warnings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 24 15:21:06 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.29.1

This is a minor bug fix follow-up, to address one major and two
minor issues with the v1.29.0 release.

Fixes:
  * segfault in the test framework on platforms without vulkan
  * error message spam when rendering to minimized/hidden windows
  * compilation on certain glslang versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 23 02:47:30 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.29.0
  The key highlights of this release are the change of pl_gpu API
  semantics to use explicit erroring instead of implicit undefined
  behavior, and several important bug fixes related to swapchain
  resizing (in particular, handling of suboptimal swapchains);
  as well as other minor utility changes, bug fixes and performance
  improvements.

  The new pl_gpu API allows clients to duplicate less code related
  to checking parameters and capabilities, as long as they're fine
  with the resulting error messages they might receive. In
  particular, libplacebo no longer aborts on invalid parameters -
  which helped during initial development, but is now suffocating
  clients more than it's helping.

Additions:
  * add a new field pl_fmt.internal_size, which can differ from
    texel_size for emulated formats
  * add 16f / 64f texture formats with host-emulated 32f
    representation
  * expose a pl_vulkan_choose_device helper function
  * add a mechanism for allowing the user to explicitly resize
    suboptimal swapchains rather than having libplacebo take care
    of it

Changes:
  * make pl_gpu log and error gracefully on illegal parameters
    rather than doing undefined behavior (i.e. aborting)
  * creating a host_mapped buffer now requires
    PL_GPU_CAP_MAPPED_BUFFERS
  * drop priv fields from public structs

Fixes and performance improvements:
  * make libplacebo slightly less log spammy in general
  * skip the creation/use of semaphores for single-queue usage
  * fix several bugs related to swapchain recreation and image
    acquisition
  * fix creation of non-renderable but storable vulkan textures
  * fix several bugs related to emulated texture downloads
  * fix pl_fmt capabilities for some emulated formats
  * fix stride/alignment of std430 vectors/matrices
  * use push constants more aggressively, whenever possible
  * slightly improve accurate of BT.2100 matrices
  * fix overzealous rotation of vulkan queues
  * fix dangling validation layer suppression in rare cases
  * fix possible swapchain deadlock on VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR
  * handle VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR more gracefully / efficiently

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 23:34:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 1.21.0
  This is a minor / house-keeping release, mostly to get some
  important fixes into distros while also getting support for iGPUs
  requiring non-coherent memory into a "stable" release.

  Additions:
  * shaders.h API users can now override the GLSL version
  * add support for vulkan platforms with non-coherent memory
    (e.g. iGPUs)

  Changes:
  * default GLSL version is now 130 unless otherwise specified
  * signature of pl_shader_alloc now uses a params struct
  * PL_FIX_VER / PL_VERSION are no longer header constants
  * the renderer will now automatically adjust deband grain scale
    for HDR

  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * on GLSL < 130, shaders now correctly use texture2D etc.
  * fix a bug where async transfer was never actually used, due to
    incorrect alignment checks
  * fixed some issues that could lead to symbol conflicts
  * don't require large vertex buffers be host-visible
    (usually impossible)
  * correctly detect swapchain image feature flags
  * turned a few 1ms busy loops into infinite waits
  * fix compilation on some platforms that require SPIRV-Tools
  * fix vkCreateEvent error spam on MoltenVK
  * bump queued command limit from 64 to 1024

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 26 01:20:30 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Build with (preferred) shaderc now that it’s packaged in TW
- Update to version 1.18.0
  The major changes of this release include a new and completely
  overhauled HDR tone mapping algorithm, support for importing
  backing memory for textures and buffers (such as via dmabuf fds),
  as well as a swapchain resizing API that, among other benefits,
  allows libplacebo to function properly on Wayland.

  There is also now support for generating CPU-backed "dummy
  resources" for things like lookup tables or convolution kernels,
  for users who prefer managing their own GPU resources.
  This allows pl_shader-level API users to access the full host of
  libplacebo shaders without being restricted the lack of a pl_gpu.

  Additions:

  * pl_color_space now has a sig_scale field, which allows
    modifying the signal range without affecting the transfer
    function's shape. (Effectively, by "stretching" it).
    This can be useful when dealing with HDR material encoded in a
    non-HDR curve such as linear light.
  * Add support for importing handles (including pl_sync objects
    and pl_shared_mem). Currently, only memory can be imported.
  * Add partial support for dmabuf fd interop. Currently does not
    support dma layout modifiers, so the usefulness of this feature
    is limited.
  * Allow importing external memory when creating textures.
  * Add a way to overexpose HDR material to bring its brightness up
    to more easily viewable levels.
  * Add pl_var_int to go alongside the other gpu.h helpers.
  * Add a way to create CPU-backed "dummy" instances of pl_gpu.
    These are not capable of compiling or executing any shaders,
    so they're only useful for users who want to generate and
    compile their own shaders.
    All GPU resources (textures, buffers) are backed by malloc.
  * Add a new field to pl_tex/buf_params allowing users to attach
    arbitrary references (void*) that libplacebo will ignore.
  * Add a function for changing the pl_context_params after
    creation.
  * Add a new API function for dealing with swapchain resize
    events. This function can be used to both query and update
    the swapchain size, based on the usage.
    Not all platforms support all operations.
  * Add new demo/skeleton based on GLFW.

  Changes:

  * Remove the hdr_simulation field from pl_color_map_params.
    Use signal_scale on the target color space instead.
  * Subdivide handle capabilities based on object type
    (texture vs buffer).
  * Completely redesign the HDR tone mapping algorithm.
    Most members of pl_tone_mapping_params have been updated,
    in particular the options related to desaturation and peak
    detection.
  * Split up the HDR peak detection API into a "detection" and
    "application" stage, which can run independently. This avoids
    the one-frame delay inherent with the previous API, and thus
    allows tone mapping to be frame perfect.
  * Remove superfluous field from pl_shader_reset left behind
    from a previous version of the API.

  Fixes and performance improvements:

  * Correctly apply the OOTF before performing linear colorspace
    operations on scene-referred content.
  * Avoid clipping when tone-mapping out of gamut content by tone
    mapping before gamut mapping.
  * Correctly reset the peak detection buffer state when running
    pl_renderer_flush_cache.
  * Correctly use the image's original color space as the reference
    space when the content is prelinearized by the renderer.
    Fixes some cases where libplacebo could end up defaulting
    PL_COLOR_TRC_AUTO to a suboptimal curve.
  * Correctly track the lifetime and ownership of individual vulkan
    buffer objects. Fixes some synchronization issues when
    attempting to use the same buffer from multiple different
    queue families.
  * Fix integer overflow on implementations with very large
    texture size limits.
  * Fix building against static libshaderc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 16 14:50:22 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Remove baselibs.conf since nothing needs it
- Fix build due to missing shaderc, which is optional
- Switch to new upstream URL
- Update to version 1.7.0
  This release marks the first major release of libplacebo, in tune
  with the release of VLC 4, which will be the first major project
  using it. Apart from API stability going forwards, this release
  brings with it a new AV1 film grain shader, better
  interoperability between libplacebo and external APIs like CUDA
  (via shared buffers and shared textures), and ICtCp support.

  While not strictly part of libplacebo, one of the highlights
  since the previous release includes the existence of a new
  example file demos/video-filtering.c which illustrates how one
  would use libplacebo to do GPU-based image filtering in something
  like FFmpeg or mpv.

Additions:

  * Add a new function pl_gpu_finish which blocks until all
    oustanding rendering on this pl_gpu is finished.
  * Add new functions pl_tex_recreate and pl_buf_recreate, which
    work like pl_tex/buf_create but take a pointer to an existing
    tex/buf that will get destroyed + recreated only when necessary
  * Add a new function pl_shader_is_failed which will return true
    if a given shader is in a "failed" state. Shaders will be
    marked as failed on any internal/usage error, rather than them
    being silently ignored.
  * Add a new enum pl_channel to clarify and encode friendly names
    for the often-referenced "canonical channel order".
  * Add a new header libplacebo/shaders/av1.h which currently
    contains a function pl_shader_av1_grain for applying AV1 film
    grain on the GPU.
  * Add a new concept of an "exportable" object (buffers and
    textures). Exportable objects can be exported using a handle
    and imported into other foreign APIs such as CUDA.
    The new functions pl_buf_export and pl_tex_export must be used
    to correctly synchronize access to the object. This also adds
    new fields uuid and handle_caps to pl_gpu.
  * Supporting the previous feature, add a new field memory_type
    to pl_buf_params which can be used to influence what type of
    memory to allocate a buffer from. Currently only works for
    texture transfer buffers, since allocating uniform/storage
    buffers from non-VRAM makes little sense.
  * Add a new synchronization primitive wrapper, pl_sync, which
    wraps a semaphore pair and must be used to synchronize access
    to textures with external, asynchronous APIs.
  * Implement the ITU-R BT.2100 ICtCp color system. Since the
    libplacebo color systems are not strictly tied to any
    particular transfer function, we must explicitly mark which
    flavor of ICtCp is meant.
  * Add a new field instance_params which can be used to influence
    the parameters used when pl_vulkan_create ends up creating an
    internal instance.
  * Add a new function pl_vulkan_unwrap which allows users to
    unwrap a vulkan-baed pl_tex to expose the internal VkImage,
    allowing simultaneous use (via pl_vulkan_hold/release) similar
    to wrapped external images.
  * Add new generic helper functions pl_std430_layout and
    pl_std140_layout which replace the old pl_buf_uniform_layout,
    pl_buf_storage_layout and pl_push_constant_layout.

Changes:

  * Empty device names ("") can now be passed to pl_vulkan_create.
    They will be treated as if NULL was passed.
  * The out_plane parameter of pl_upload_plane is now optional.
  * Clarify/Relax the restrictions on pl_buf usage and polling.
    Users are technically free to use pl_buf for multiple
    simultaneous libplacebo operations. Buffer polling is only
    needed for accesses by the host.
  * pl_vulkan_hold now returns a bool indicating success.
  * pl_buffer_var has been moved from gpu.h's pl_desc to
    shaders.h's pl_shader_desc. Describing the individual variables
    of a descriptor binding had zero practical application.
  * pl_buf_uniform_layout, pl_buf_storage_layout and
    pl_push_constant_layout are now macros for pl_std140_layout
    and pl_std430_layout (respectively).
    This changed the signature to drop the pl_gpu parameter.
  * The buf_offset parameter to pl_tex_transfer no longer needs to
    be strictly aligned to a multiple of 4. The minimum alignment
    is now 1, however users are strongly recommended to stick to
    the multiple-of-4 alignment (or ideally align_tex_xfer_offset)
    for performance reasons.
  * The chromatic adaptation method in pl_get_color_mapping_matrix
    has been adjusted. We now use an LMS model derived from
    CIECAM97's revised linear Bradford matrix, rather than the
    non-linear matrix that was being used previously (incorrectly
    so, due to the lack of the required nonlinearity).
  * The order of fields in pl_rect3d has been changed for
    consistency with the other rect types.

Fixes and performance improvements:

  * Fix std140/std430 packing errors for vec3.
  * Skip unnecessary flush in pl_buf_poll noop cases.
  * Fix variable collision in sh_prng.
  * Don't leak glslang internal symbols on supported platforms.
  * Fix an issue where pl_pass_run was stricter than intended about
    compatibility with between target and target_dummy.
  * Fix an issue where pl_dispatch could sometimes try dispatching
    shaders with an incompatible target.
  * Fix an error in the heuristic for choosing the optimal image
    layout for vulkan render passes.
  * Improved debugging messages in several places.
  * Slightly speed up lookups from texture LUTs.
  * Fix the addressing of shader LUTs in some hypothetical cases.
  * Correctly flush the contents of host-readable buffers after
    modifications made by the GPU.
  * Fix synchronization on pl_buf_write with non-mapped buffers.
  * Fix undefined behavior when using push descriptors.
  * Slightly speed up some texture recreate operations by
    invalidating re-used textures.
  * Fix an issue when trying to update large (>64k) VRAM-resident
    buffers.
  * Fix two address calculation bugs in pl_tex_blit.
  * Fix an over-read bug when the size of the vertex data changed
    for otherwise identical passes.
  * Fix a misalignment that could theoretically happen with some
    combinations of (odd) texel sizes and device alignment
    requirements.
  * Fix UB when creating "useless" images (without any usage flags)
  * Fix a vulkan device memory leak when destroying large textures.
  * Fix an alignment issue that could happen sometimes with
    pl_buf_write for odd write sizes.
  * Fix an alignment bug when uploading partial textures when async
    transfer is enabled on some devices.
  * Fix crash in pl_color_primaries_is_wide_gamut on DISPLAY_P3.
  * Fix an error when re-using shader objects between polar and
    non-polar samplers. This is now safe to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 28 11:18:38 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Add C/C++ compilers, glslang and lcms2 to BuildRequires
- Update to version 0.6.0
  This release brings with it a number of minor fixes and changes,
  as well as a new feature for simulating, and partially
  counteracting, various forms of color blindness. For more
  information see the new pl_cone_params structure and
  pl_get_cone_matrix function.

  Additions:
  * VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR is now supported, and gets
    treated as PL_ALPHA_UNKNOWN.
  * Add a new feature for simulating various forms of color
    blindness (based on the LMS color model).

  Changes:
  * Setting pl_render_params.upscaler/downscaler to NULL no longer
    allows automatically choosing bicubic, since this breaks
    various other optimizations that are only possible when using
    the built-in GPU sampling. This now only chooses
    bilinear/nearest depending on the texture/hardware capabilities
  * The public API of pl_shader_alloc was changed:
    the uint8_t ident field was removed. This makes no real sense
    to expose publicly, since users had no legitimate use for it
    other than setting it to 0.

  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * The pl_dither_params.lut_size now gets correctly defaulted to 6
  * Fixed some use-after-scope bugs in the renderer
  * Fixed colorspace selection when using user-specified swapchain
    formats
  * Peak detection is now correctly disabled if the buffer size is
    set to 0. (Before, it would default back to 63 in that case)
  * Fix the out-of-gamut warning feature. This previously stopped
    working for out-of-range tone mapped values.

- Update to 0.5.0
  This release brings with it greatly improved support for HDR (including
  HDR-in-SDR emulation, native HDR passthrough and improvements to the
  HDR->SDR tone mapping algorithm), as well as support for ICC profiles
  and external VkImage interop (needed for e.g. hardware decoding).

  Additions:
  * Add support for treating an SDR curve as an HDR curve by
    overriding/providing the true target peak. This essentially allows you
    to calibrate a true HDR device to a typical SDR curve and use it to
    display HDR media, at the cost of bit precision
  * Add more values to enum pl_chroma_location
  * Add a scale factor to struct pl_sample_src, which is useful for e.g.
    debanding on bit-shifted inputs
  * Add a new function to infer/guess unknown pl_color_space fields
  * Add support for 3DLUTs / ICC profiles (via LittleCMS), including
    support for assigning ICC profiles to the `pl_render_image` and
    `pl_render_target` structs
  * Allow enabling optional extra vulkan device/instance extensions, as
    well as listing what extensions were actually loaded
  * Add an API for VkImage interop with user code, e.g. to wrap mapped
    hardware decoding planes into `pl_tex`, plus all synchronization code
    and extra metadata necessary to make this interop safe
  * Implement support for native HDR output on supported platforms

  Changes:
  * Separate the texture from the plane data struct in `pl_upload_plane`
  * Swapchain FBOs are now guaranteed to be blittable (e.g. pl_tex_clear)
  * Tone mapping is no longer done for desaturation steps. Users wanting
    high quality desaturation should use ICC profiles
  * Change the types of various fields in struct pl_gpu_limits
  * Slightly relax the sizing requirements of pl_tex_transfer
  * Change the default value for pl_tex_transfer_params.stride_w/h.
    Instead of defaulting to the image size, they now default to the rect to
    be transferred
  * Texture transfer buffer offsets must (now) be aligned to the texel
    size, in addition to being a multiple of 4
  * Change the API of `pl_color_space_equal` to be consistent with the
    rest of the colorspace APIs
  * Allow the `pl_upload_plane` helpers to upload from buffers as well
  * Switch the type of mapped buffer pointers from char* to uint8_t*
  * Rename DCI_P3 to Display_P3, and add DCI_P3 (using the actual DCI white
    point)

  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * Fix some compatibility issues with GLSL 120
  * Prevent desaturation from exploding when tone mapping to HDR, or when
    tone mapping a very bright HDR scene to SDR
  * Implement the fully parametrized BT.2100 (HLG) OOTF in both
    directions, based on the tagged/inferred signal peak
  * Fix an issue preventing the out-of-gamut feature from working
    correctly on HDR displays
  * Fix a segfault that occurs when instance creation fails
  * Fix an issue where `peak_detect_frames` was sometimes too low
  * Allow debanding to take care of implicit bilinear sampling in cases
    where no other scaler is requested, thus avoiding an unnecessary FBO
    indirection
  * Only run the debanding algorithm on the parts of the image we will
    actually be displaying. This is relevant when cropping
  * Fix an issue where PL_TONE_MAPPINg_MOBIUS could fail in certain
    (unrealistic) scenarios involving HDR-in-SDR emulation
  * Fix an issue where vulkan could sometimes modify commands after
    submitting them, when recreating vertex buffers
  * Make an effort to reuse the same vertex buffer when the contents don't
    change from the previous invocation
  * Fix the glslang locale work-arounds on windows
  * Fix an issue where trying to upload from a too-large texel buffer
    results in an assertion failure rather than a clean error
  * Fix an issue where the usage of VkEvents prevented libplacebo from
    working on platforms where they were unsupported (e.g. MoltenVK)
  * Support and use vulkan push descriptors where supported. This avoids
    having to maintain, update and synchronize descriptor sets
  * Correctly disable signal linearization on low-bit depth FBOs
  * Prevent a crash on the (pathological) case of a shader with no
    descriptors
  * Fix a bug in the size limit calculations for 2D/3D LUTs
  * Use optimization level "performance" instead of "size" for shader
    compilation
  * Fix an abort() when trying to render to a non-storable FBO when using
    a final pass that requires compute shaders (e.g. HDR peak detection)
