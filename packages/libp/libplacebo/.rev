    <comment>- Update to 0.5.0
  This release brings with it greatly improved support for HDR (including
  HDR-in-SDR emulation, native HDR passthrough and improvements to the
  HDR-&gt;SDR tone mapping algorithm), as well as support for ICC profiles
  and external VkImage interop (needed for e.g. hardware decoding).
  Additions:
  * Add support for treating an SDR curve as an HDR curve by
    overriding/providing the true target peak. This essentially allows you
    to calibrate a true HDR device to a typical SDR curve and use it to
    display HDR media, at the cost of bit precision
  * Add more values to enum pl_chroma_location
  * Add a scale factor to struct pl_sample_src, which is useful for e.g.
    debanding on bit-shifted inputs
  * Add a new function to infer/guess unknown pl_color_space fields
  * Add support for 3DLUTs / ICC profiles (via LittleCMS), including
    support for assigning ICC profiles to the `pl_render_image` and
    `pl_render_target` structs
  * Allow enabling optional extra vulkan device/instance extensions, as
    well as listing what extensions were actually loaded
  * Add an API for VkImage interop with user code, e.g. to wrap mapped
    hardware decoding planes into `pl_tex`, plus all synchronization code
    and extra metadata necessary to make this interop safe
  * Implement support for native HDR output on supported platforms
  Changes:
  * Separate the texture from the plane data struct in `pl_upload_plane`
  * Swapchain FBOs are now guaranteed to be blittable (e.g. pl_tex_clear)
  * Tone mapping is no longer done for desaturation steps. Users wanting
    high quality desaturation should use ICC profiles
  * Change the types of various fields in struct pl_gpu_limits
  * Slightly relax the sizing requirements of pl_tex_transfer
  * Change the default value for pl_tex_transfer_params.stride_w/h.
    Instead of defaulting to the image size, they now default to the rect to
    be transferred
  * Texture transfer buffer offsets must (now) be aligned to the texel
    size, in addition to being a multiple of 4
  * Change the API of `pl_color_space_equal` to be consistent with the
    rest of the colorspace APIs
  * Allow the `pl_upload_plane` helpers to upload from buffers as well
  * Switch the type of mapped buffer pointers from char* to uint8_t*
  * Rename DCI_P3 to Display_P3, and add DCI_P3 (using the actual DCI white
    point)
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * Fix some compatibility issues with GLSL 120
  * Prevent desaturation from exploding when tone mapping to HDR, or when
    tone mapping a very bright HDR scene to SDR
  * Implement the fully parametrized BT.2100 (HLG) OOTF in both
    directions, based on the tagged/inferred signal peak
  * Fix an issue preventing the out-of-gamut feature from working
    correctly on HDR displays
  * Fix a segfault that occurs when instance creation fails
  * Fix an issue where `peak_detect_frames` was sometimes too low
  * Allow debanding to take care of implicit bilinear sampling in cases
    where no other scaler is requested, thus avoiding an unnecessary FBO
    indirection
  * Only run the debanding algorithm on the parts of the image we will
    actually be displaying. This is relevant when cropping
  * Fix an issue where PL_TONE_MAPPINg_MOBIUS could fail in certain
    (unrealistic) scenarios involving HDR-in-SDR emulation
  * Fix an issue where vulkan could sometimes modify commands after
    submitting them, when recreating vertex buffers
  * Make an effort to reuse the same vertex buffer when the contents don't
    change from the previous invocation
  * Fix the glslang locale work-arounds on windows
  * Fix an issue where trying to upload from a too-large texel buffer
    results in an assertion failure rather than a clean error
  * Fix an issue where the usage of VkEvents prevented libplacebo from
    working on platforms where they were unsupported (e.g. MoltenVK)
  * Support and use vulkan push descriptors where supported. This avoids
    having to maintain, update and synchronize descriptor sets
  * Correctly disable signal linearization on low-bit depth FBOs
  * Prevent a crash on the (pathological) case of a shader with no
    descriptors
  * Fix a bug in the size limit calculations for 2D/3D LUTs
  * Use optimization level &quot;performance&quot; instead of &quot;size&quot; for shader
    compilation
  * Fix an abort() when trying to render to a non-storable FBO when using
    a final pass that requires compute shaders (e.g. HDR peak detection)

    <time>1545141509</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Remove baselibs.conf since nothing needs it
- Fix build due to missing shaderc, which is optional
- Switch to new upstream URL
- Update to version 1.7.0
  This release marks the first major release of libplacebo, in tune
  with the release of VLC 4, which will be the first major project
  using it. Apart from API stability going forwards, this release
  brings with it a new AV1 film grain shader, better
  interoperability between libplacebo and external APIs like CUDA
  (via shared buffers and shared textures), and ICtCp support.
  While not strictly part of libplacebo, one of the highlights
  since the previous release includes the existence of a new
  example file demos/video-filtering.c which illustrates how one
  would use libplacebo to do GPU-based image filtering in something
  like FFmpeg or mpv.
Additions:
  * Add a new function pl_gpu_finish which blocks until all
    oustanding rendering on this pl_gpu is finished.
  * Add new functions pl_tex_recreate and pl_buf_recreate, which
    work like pl_tex/buf_create but take a pointer to an existing
    tex/buf that will get destroyed + recreated only when necessary
  * Add a new function pl_shader_is_failed which will return true
    if a given shader is in a &quot;failed&quot; state. Shaders will be
    marked as failed on any internal/usage error, rather than them
    being silently ignored.
  * Add a new enum pl_channel to clarify and encode friendly names
    for the often-referenced &quot;canonical channel order&quot;.
  * Add a new header libplacebo/shaders/av1.h which currently
    contains a function pl_shader_av1_grain for applying AV1 film
    grain on the GPU.
  * Add a new concept of an &quot;exportable&quot; object (buffers and
    textures). Exportable objects can be exported using a handle
    and imported into other foreign APIs such as CUDA.
    The new functions pl_buf_export and pl_tex_export must be used
    to correctly synchronize access to the object. This also adds
    new fields uuid and handle_caps to pl_gpu.
  * Supporting the previous feature, add a new field memory_type
    to pl_buf_params which can be used to influence what type of
    memory to allocate a buffer from. Currently only works for
    texture transfer buffers, since allocating uniform/storage
    buffers from non-VRAM makes little sense.
  * Add a new synchronization primitive wrapper, pl_sync, which
    wraps a semaphore pair and must be used to synchronize access
    to textures with external, asynchronous APIs.
  * Implement the ITU-R BT.2100 ICtCp color system. Since the
    libplacebo color systems are not strictly tied to any
    particular transfer function, we must explicitly mark which
    flavor of ICtCp is meant.
  * Add a new field instance_params which can be used to influence
    the parameters used when pl_vulkan_create ends up creating an
    internal instance.
  * Add a new function pl_vulkan_unwrap which allows users to
    unwrap a vulkan-baed pl_tex to expose the internal VkImage,
    allowing simultaneous use (via pl_vulkan_hold/release) similar
    to wrapped external images.
  * Add new generic helper functions pl_std430_layout and
    pl_std140_layout which replace the old pl_buf_uniform_layout,
    pl_buf_storage_layout and pl_push_constant_layout.
Changes:
  * Empty device names (&quot;&quot;) can now be passed to pl_vulkan_create.
    They will be treated as if NULL was passed.
  * The out_plane parameter of pl_upload_plane is now optional.
  * Clarify/Relax the restrictions on pl_buf usage and polling.
    Users are technically free to use pl_buf for multiple
    simultaneous libplacebo operations. Buffer polling is only
    needed for accesses by the host.
  * pl_vulkan_hold now returns a bool indicating success.
  * pl_buffer_var has been moved from gpu.h's pl_desc to
    shaders.h's pl_shader_desc. Describing the individual variables
    of a descriptor binding had zero practical application.
  * pl_buf_uniform_layout, pl_buf_storage_layout and
    pl_push_constant_layout are now macros for pl_std140_layout
    and pl_std430_layout (respectively).
    This changed the signature to drop the pl_gpu parameter.
  * The buf_offset parameter to pl_tex_transfer no longer needs to
    be strictly aligned to a multiple of 4. The minimum alignment
    is now 1, however users are strongly recommended to stick to
    the multiple-of-4 alignment (or ideally align_tex_xfer_offset)
    for performance reasons.
  * The chromatic adaptation method in pl_get_color_mapping_matrix
    has been adjusted. We now use an LMS model derived from
    CIECAM97's revised linear Bradford matrix, rather than the
    non-linear matrix that was being used previously (incorrectly
    so, due to the lack of the required nonlinearity).
  * The order of fields in pl_rect3d has been changed for
    consistency with the other rect types.
Fixes and performance improvements:
  * Fix std140/std430 packing errors for vec3.
  * Skip unnecessary flush in pl_buf_poll noop cases.
  * Fix variable collision in sh_prng.
  * Don't leak glslang internal symbols on supported platforms.
  * Fix an issue where pl_pass_run was stricter than intended about
    compatibility with between target and target_dummy.
  * Fix an issue where pl_dispatch could sometimes try dispatching
    shaders with an incompatible target.
  * Fix an error in the heuristic for choosing the optimal image
    layout for vulkan render passes.
  * Improved debugging messages in several places.
  * Slightly speed up lookups from texture LUTs.
  * Fix the addressing of shader LUTs in some hypothetical cases.
  * Correctly flush the contents of host-readable buffers after
    modifications made by the GPU.
  * Fix synchronization on pl_buf_write with non-mapped buffers.
  * Fix undefined behavior when using push descriptors.
  * Slightly speed up some texture recreate operations by
    invalidating re-used textures.
  * Fix an issue when trying to update large (&gt;64k) VRAM-resident
    buffers.
  * Fix two address calculation bugs in pl_tex_blit.
  * Fix an over-read bug when the size of the vertex data changed
    for otherwise identical passes.
  * Fix a misalignment that could theoretically happen with some
    combinations of (odd) texel sizes and device alignment
    requirements.
  * Fix UB when creating &quot;useless&quot; images (without any usage flags)
  * Fix a vulkan device memory leak when destroying large textures.
  * Fix an alignment issue that could happen sometimes with
    pl_buf_write for odd write sizes.
  * Fix an alignment bug when uploading partial textures when async
    transfer is enabled on some devices.
  * Fix crash in pl_color_primaries_is_wide_gamut on DISPLAY_P3.
  * Fix an error when re-using shader objects between polar and
    non-polar samplers. This is now safe to do.
- Add C/C++ compilers, glslang and lcms2 to BuildRequires
- Update to version 0.6.0
  This release brings with it a number of minor fixes and changes,
  as well as a new feature for simulating, and partially
  counteracting, various forms of color blindness. For more
  information see the new pl_cone_params structure and
  pl_get_cone_matrix function.
  Additions:
  * VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR is now supported, and gets
    treated as PL_ALPHA_UNKNOWN.
  * Add a new feature for simulating various forms of color
    blindness (based on the LMS color model).
  Changes:
  * Setting pl_render_params.upscaler/downscaler to NULL no longer
    allows automatically choosing bicubic, since this breaks
    various other optimizations that are only possible when using
    the built-in GPU sampling. This now only chooses
    bilinear/nearest depending on the texture/hardware capabilities
  * The public API of pl_shader_alloc was changed:
    the uint8_t ident field was removed. This makes no real sense
    to expose publicly, since users had no legitimate use for it
    other than setting it to 0.
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * The pl_dither_params.lut_size now gets correctly defaulted to 6
  * Fixed some use-after-scope bugs in the renderer
  * Fixed colorspace selection when using user-specified swapchain
    formats
  * Peak detection is now correctly disabled if the buffer size is
    set to 0. (Before, it would default back to 63 in that case)
  * Fix the out-of-gamut warning feature. This previously stopped
    working for out-of-range tone mapped values.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Build with (preferred) shaderc now that it’s packaged in TW
- Update to version 1.18.0
  The major changes of this release include a new and completely
  overhauled HDR tone mapping algorithm, support for importing
  backing memory for textures and buffers (such as via dmabuf fds),
  as well as a swapchain resizing API that, among other benefits,
  allows libplacebo to function properly on Wayland.
  There is also now support for generating CPU-backed &quot;dummy
  resources&quot; for things like lookup tables or convolution kernels,
  for users who prefer managing their own GPU resources.
  This allows pl_shader-level API users to access the full host of
  libplacebo shaders without being restricted the lack of a pl_gpu.
  Additions:
  * pl_color_space now has a sig_scale field, which allows
    modifying the signal range without affecting the transfer
    function's shape. (Effectively, by &quot;stretching&quot; it).
    This can be useful when dealing with HDR material encoded in a
    non-HDR curve such as linear light.
  * Add support for importing handles (including pl_sync objects
    and pl_shared_mem). Currently, only memory can be imported.
  * Add partial support for dmabuf fd interop. Currently does not
    support dma layout modifiers, so the usefulness of this feature
    is limited.
  * Allow importing external memory when creating textures.
  * Add a way to overexpose HDR material to bring its brightness up
    to more easily viewable levels.
  * Add pl_var_int to go alongside the other gpu.h helpers.
  * Add a way to create CPU-backed &quot;dummy&quot; instances of pl_gpu.
    These are not capable of compiling or executing any shaders,
    so they're only useful for users who want to generate and
    compile their own shaders.
    All GPU resources (textures, buffers) are backed by malloc.
  * Add a new field to pl_tex/buf_params allowing users to attach
    arbitrary references (void*) that libplacebo will ignore.
  * Add a function for changing the pl_context_params after
    creation.
  * Add a new API function for dealing with swapchain resize
    events. This function can be used to both query and update
    the swapchain size, based on the usage.
    Not all platforms support all operations.
  * Add new demo/skeleton based on GLFW.
  Changes:
  * Remove the hdr_simulation field from pl_color_map_params.
    Use signal_scale on the target color space instead.
  * Subdivide handle capabilities based on object type
    (texture vs buffer).
  * Completely redesign the HDR tone mapping algorithm.
    Most members of pl_tone_mapping_params have been updated,
    in particular the options related to desaturation and peak
    detection.
  * Split up the HDR peak detection API into a &quot;detection&quot; and
    &quot;application&quot; stage, which can run independently. This avoids
    the one-frame delay inherent with the previous API, and thus
    allows tone mapping to be frame perfect.
  * Remove superfluous field from pl_shader_reset left behind
    from a previous version of the API.
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * Correctly apply the OOTF before performing linear colorspace
    operations on scene-referred content.
  * Avoid clipping when tone-mapping out of gamut content by tone
    mapping before gamut mapping.
  * Correctly reset the peak detection buffer state when running
    pl_renderer_flush_cache.
  * Correctly use the image's original color space as the reference
    space when the content is prelinearized by the renderer.
    Fixes some cases where libplacebo could end up defaulting
    PL_COLOR_TRC_AUTO to a suboptimal curve.
  * Correctly track the lifetime and ownership of individual vulkan
    buffer objects. Fixes some synchronization issues when
    attempting to use the same buffer from multiple different
    queue families.
  * Fix integer overflow on implementations with very large
    texture size limits.
  * Fix building against static libshaderc.

    <comment>- Update to version 1.21.0
  This is a minor / house-keeping release, mostly to get some
  important fixes into distros while also getting support for iGPUs
  requiring non-coherent memory into a &quot;stable&quot; release.
  Additions:
  * shaders.h API users can now override the GLSL version
  * add support for vulkan platforms with non-coherent memory
    (e.g. iGPUs)
  Changes:
  * default GLSL version is now 130 unless otherwise specified
  * signature of pl_shader_alloc now uses a params struct
  * PL_FIX_VER / PL_VERSION are no longer header constants
  * the renderer will now automatically adjust deband grain scale
    for HDR
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  * on GLSL &lt; 130, shaders now correctly use texture2D etc.
  * fix a bug where async transfer was never actually used, due to
    incorrect alignment checks
  * fixed some issues that could lead to symbol conflicts
  * don't require large vertex buffers be host-visible
    (usually impossible)
  * correctly detect swapchain image feature flags
  * turned a few 1ms busy loops into infinite waits
  * fix compilation on some platforms that require SPIRV-Tools
  * fix vkCreateEvent error spam on MoltenVK
  * bump queued command limit from 64 to 1024</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.29.0
  The key highlights of this release are the change of pl_gpu API
  semantics to use explicit erroring instead of implicit undefined
  behavior, and several important bug fixes related to swapchain
  resizing (in particular, handling of suboptimal swapchains);
  as well as other minor utility changes, bug fixes and performance
  improvements.
  The new pl_gpu API allows clients to duplicate less code related
  to checking parameters and capabilities, as long as they're fine
  with the resulting error messages they might receive. In
  particular, libplacebo no longer aborts on invalid parameters -
  which helped during initial development, but is now suffocating
  clients more than it's helping.
Additions:
  * add a new field pl_fmt.internal_size, which can differ from
    texel_size for emulated formats
  * add 16f / 64f texture formats with host-emulated 32f
    representation
  * expose a pl_vulkan_choose_device helper function
  * add a mechanism for allowing the user to explicitly resize
    suboptimal swapchains rather than having libplacebo take care
    of it
Changes:
  * make pl_gpu log and error gracefully on illegal parameters
    rather than doing undefined behavior (i.e. aborting)
  * creating a host_mapped buffer now requires
    PL_GPU_CAP_MAPPED_BUFFERS
  * drop priv fields from public structs

  * make libplacebo slightly less log spammy in general</comment>

    <comment>- Add libepoxy to BuildRequires
- Enable test suite
- Update to version 2.43.0
The major highlight of this release is the introduction of a new
OpenGL backend, documented in &lt;libplacebo/opengl.h&gt;, which is also
the reason for the major version bump.
Apart from the addition of OpenGL support, this release brings with
it a large number of fixes for backwards compatibility with older
versions of GLSL and GLES, allowing libplacebo to be used to
generate legal shaders for virtually any GLSL version in existence.
Supporting these changes, the test framework has been expanded
considerably to allow for automated testing of older OpenGL context
versions and older GLSL versions.
Additions:
  * add pl_gpu.pci, containing the PCI address of the underlying
    GPU
  * add pl_image.av1_grain, allowing pl_renderer to add AV1 grain
  * add pl_opengl backend (see &lt;libplacebo/opengl.h&gt;)
  * add pl_color_levels_guess, to infer color levels from
    pl_color_repr
  * pl_shader_encode_color now handles non-linear color systems
  * add pl_render_params.force_dither, to force use of the dither
    code
  * add pl_render_params.disable_fbos, to forcibly disable FBOs
  * add pl_vk_inst_params.layers, to allow loading extra vulkan
    layers
  * add a way to restrict the maximum GLSL version provided by the
    various pl_gpu backends, for testing purposes

    <comment>- Update to version 2.43.1
This release backports a number of bug fixes from master affecting
the v2.43.0 release, and also slightly extends the range of
backwards compatibility with respect to vulkan-headers versions.
(This change is not on master, so this can be seen as a
compatibility release)
Bug fixes:
  * fix GLSL version checks when overriding GLSL versions with
    pl_shader_params.glsl
  * fix minor order-of-operations issue in AV1 grain synthesis
  * fix glInvalidate* backwards compatibility issue
  * fix compilation with older vulkan-headers (e.g. ubuntu 18.04)
  * fix a bug where pl_shader_encode_color sometimes uploaded and
    applied an identity matrix unnecessarily
  * work around upstream issues with MSL shader compilation by
    ensuring all buffer elements are sorted by offset
  * fix hypothetical edge case with swapchain image usages
    forbidden by the swapchain image format
  * fix an issue where blending overlays caused the rest of the
    image to be discarded
Other changes:
  * log the vulkan surface selection choices
  * log the overall library version on initialization
  * add a few more pl_gpu validation checks
  * significantly reduce the CPU consumpation of blocking texture

    <comment>- Update to version 2.72.0
This is a major release with several key additions, most notably
being the support for custom, mpv-style &quot;user shaders&quot; (.hook),
giving us access to a large variety of pre-existing user shaders
such as RAVU, FSRCNNX, Anime4K, SSimSuperRes, KrigBilateral,
NNEDI3, and more.
In addition to this, major additions include a completely
refactored and fixed AV1 grain generation shader, support for
Vulkan versions higher than 1.0, support for GPU-based timers,
and improved interop APIs for both Vulkan and OpenGL, and new
and improved aspect ratio handling.
Finally, this release also brings with it a major change to the way
HDR and SDR content are mapped between each other, including a new
tone-mapping function based on the industry-standard
ITU-R BT.2390 EETF.
Additions:
  * add pl_swapchain_hdr_metadata, to set HDR metadata on supported
    swapchains (currently only vulkan with VK_EXT_hdr_metadata)
  * add support for vulkan versions higher than 1.0, communicated
    via the new fields api_version and max_api_version
  * add support for GPU-assisted validation and best practices
    layers, via the new field pl_vk_inst_params.debug_extra
  * add helper functions for working with pl_rects, including new
    aspect ratio handling helpers (pl_rect2df_aspect_*)
  * add field pl_vulkan_params.device_uuid to allow choosing the
    vulkan device by its UUID
  * add function pl_vulkan_hold_raw, to hold images without
    actually transitioning its layout and access mode
  * add function pl_vulkan_import, to allow directly re-using an
    existing VkDevice rather than creating a new one; this requires</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 3.104.0
This is a major release, introducing many new features and
modifications. Most importantly, libplacebo now interoperates well
with FFmpeg's libav* abstractions. This is primarily exposed via a
new set of helpers, &lt;libplacebo/utils/libav.h&gt;, implemented as a
single header library. In addition to this, a number of other
supporting changes have been made to the API, most notably the
unification of `pl_image` and `pl_render_target` into a single
`pl_frame` concept, similar in spirit to AVFrame. As such,
libplacebo now supports **rendering to planar targets**, including
subsampled YCbCr.
Besides the libav* compatibility changes, this release also brings
with it a new feature for custom shaders: buffer blocks, and
persistent storage. This can be used by third parties to implement
stateful shaders (e.g. motion interpolation or temporal
deinterlacing), or be leveraged to speed up some shaders by
combining multiple passes into one.
Finally, various import/export procedures have been expanded,
including the ability to import host pointers and real-world
DMABUFs.
Additions:
  * add `pl_memory_qualifiers`, plus a corresponding
    `pl_shader_desc.memory`, to allow attaching GLSL memory
    qualifiers (coherent, volatile etc.) to shader descriptors
  * add functions `pl_dispatch_save` and `pl_dispatch_load` to
    allow saving/restoring the contents of an entire
    `pl_dispatch`'s cache
  * add functions `pl_renderer_save` and `pl_renderer_load` to
    allow saving/restoring the contents of an entire
    `pl_renderer`'s cache
  * add `pl_vulkan_swapchain_params.prefer_hdr`, which will cause
    the surface format selection logic to try HDR output formats
    first
  * add `pl_buf_copy` to copy from one buffer to another
  * add `pl_get_detected_peak`, to read back the result of peak
    detection
  * add `pl_primaries_superset` to test if one set of primaries is
    fully enclosed by another
  * add `pl_color_map_params.gamut_clipping`, which will
    colorimetrically clip any out-of-gamut colors by desaturating
    them towards neutral gray until they're in-gamut, rather than
    clipping per channel as before
  * add `PL_GPU_CAP_SUBGROUPS` and `pl_gpu_limits.subgroup_size`,
    to expose GLSL subgroup functionality via the `pl_gpu`
    interface
  * add `pl_gpu_is_failed`, to query at a high level whether the
    `pl_gpu` is in some internal failure state. GPUs in this state
    should be recreated, using the appropriate mechanism
  * add `pl_shader_custom`, to allow injecting arbitrary custom
    GLSL code into a `pl_shader`.
  * add `pl_buf_params.import_handle` to allow importing buffers
  * add `PL_HANDLE_HOST_POTR`, to allow importing arbitrary host
    pointers
  * add `pl_pass_run_params.vertex_buf`, to allow drawing vertex
    data directly from a `pl_buf`, guarded by
    `pl_gpu_limits.max_vbo_size`
  * add `_COUNT` members to all public enums, for consistency
  * add `pl_shared_mem.drm_format_mod`, to allow communicating
    DRM format modifiers when importing/exporting textures
  * add support for importing DMABUFs via EGL, via the new fields
    `pl_opengl_params.egl_display/context`
  * add `pl_fmt.fourcc` to facilitate mapping between `pl_fmt` and
    DRM
  * add the missing `pl_var_*` helpers, for consistency
  * add `pl_plane_data_align` to help with aligning
    `pl_plane_data` structs to byte boundaries
  * add support for STORAGE textures in user shaders, which can be
    used to persist data across separate invocations of the shader
  * add support for BUFFER blocks in user shaders, which can be
    used to create UBOs or SSBOs for use inside shaders, the latter
    of which can also persist across frames and be used to store
    persistent state
  * add PL_COLOR_PRIM_EBU_3213 and PL_COLOR_PRIM_FILM_C
  * add a new header &lt;libplacebo/utils/libav.h&gt;, containing a
    variety of helper functions for interoperating between libav*
    and libplacebo
  * add `demos/plplay.c` to serve as a demonstration of how to make
    a trivial playback loop with libavcodec and libplacebo
  * add `pl_sample_src.component_mask` to allow sampling an
    arbitrary subset of the available components from a plane
  * add `pl_frame_is_cropped` and `pl_frame_clear` to assist in
    properly clearing frames before rendering to them
  * add `pl_tex_poll` to assist in interoperating with some
    external APIs
  * add `pl_render_params.blend_params` to allow blending the final
    output
Changes:
  * remove `pl_image.signature` and
    `pl_render_params.skip_redraw_caching`
  * change vulkan surface format selection to prioritize formats by
    'score', preferring higher depth integer formats
  * `pl_fmt` may now have PL_FMT_CAP_STORABLE even when
    `glsl_format` is NULL, in which case formatless image storage
    must be used
  * `pl_buf_read` no longer requires `buf_offset` be a multiple of
    4
  * `pl_buf_*` commands are now synchronized internally:
  * `pl_buf_write` and `pl_buf_read` now block while the buffer is
    in use Note: for this reason, `pl_buf_write` should not be used
    in loops
  * `pl_tex_upload/download` may now be called on in-use buffers
  * allow `pl_dispatch_compute` on shaders with outputs, including
    the ability to automatically determine the number of work
    groups based on the shader output resolution
  * remove `pl_buf_params.type`, and the concept of buffer types in
    general. `pl_buf` is now a generic catch-all for any type of
    buffer, with individual capabilities in `pl_buf_params`
    determinig what type of shader operations it can be used for

    component from a channel with nonzero index
  * `pl_renderer` now supports rendering to planar targets,
    including subsampled targets
  * `pl_image` and `pl_render_target` have been removed and unified
    into a single `pl_frame` concept
  * remove `pl_tex_params.sample_mode/address_mode` and move them
    to `pl_desc_binding` instead, to decouple them from texture
    creation
  * refactor the signature of `pl_tex_blit`

  * fix an oversight where `pl_buf_destroy` delayed some buffer
    destructions unnecessarily

    destroying textures unnecessarily
  * improve the performance of `pl_dispatch`'s code for assembling

    <comment>- Update libplacebo to version 3.120.1:
This hotfix release fixes a number of minor issues with the v3.120.0
release, and also modularizes the included demo programs to cut down on
the number of compiled binaries.
Changes:
- hexadecimal strings in custom shaders may now include whitespace
- added 16-bit half float formats to the dummy pl_gpu
- significantly reduced verbosity of the included demo programs
- merged all of the demo program variants into a single binary that
  picks the best windowing system / graphical API at runtime
- install `plplay` when demos are enabled
Fixes and performance improvements:
- fixed an integer overflow in a texture bounds check
- fixed a false positive error in the test framework on 32-bit platforms
- fixed some minor issues with various outdated comments
- fixed a potential use-after-free in the `plplay` demo program when
  playing files containing embedded ICC profiles
- Update libplacebo to version 3.120.0. (Upstream changelog appended)
- Create a new package `plplay` for the included demo program. This requires
  bundling a copy of `nuklear.h`, which is single-header library not included
  as part of the libplacebo source distribution.
This is a feature release, introducing frame mixing, DRM format
modifiers, and support for custom LUTs -, while also greatly expanding
the available demo programs, in particular the `plplay` video player.
The main highlight is the new `pl_queue` abstraction living in
&lt;libplacebo/utils/frame_queue.h&gt;. This greatly simplifies the core of a
libplacebo-based video renderer by translating a stream of input frames
into an array of GPU-mapped textures suitable for frame mixing, given a
corresponding vsync timestamp. New frames can be delivered to this API
using a push or pull model, and they are lazily uploaded on an as-needed
basis as well as internally garbage collected when no longer needed.
This abstraction also contains all needed machinery for estimating
source/display framerates by comparing and averaging timestamps, freeing
users from the burden of having to accurately determine this information
a priori.
Also worth mentioning is the addition of support for custom LUTs,
currently only in Adobe's .cube format. They can be applied flexibly at
a number of locations in the video processing pipeline, including as a
replacement for YUV&lt;-&gt;RGB conversion or tone/gamut mapping, and fed with
either normalized linear light or native-gamma values.
Among the included demo programs, the `plplay` example video player has
been greatly expanded - adding support for a settings GUI (based on
nuklear), frame timing and mixing, custom shaders, and more. This
example video player now serves as a convenient platform to demonstrate
all of libplacebo's advanced rendering features.
Finally, all of libplacebo now contains only code written entirely from
scratch (rather than deriving from mpv), opening up the possibility to
explore different licenses besides the current LGPLv2.1+. In particular,
permissive (MIT/BSD-style) licenses are being considered.
Additions:
- add asynchronous GPU callbacks, specifically to `pl_tex_transfer`,
  allowing for non-blocking host memory transfer operations
- add `pl_shared_mem.stride_w/h` to control dmabuf pitch
- add `pl_render_image_mix` to blend multiple frames into a single
  output image, given relative timestamp information
- add the `pl_filter_mitchell_clamp` filter preset
- add `pl_render_params.preserve_mixing_cache` to speed up redraws after
  renderer size changes when frame mixing is active
- add &lt;libplacebo/utils/dav1d.h&gt; to help with Dav1dPicture mapping
- implement `PL_HANDLE_HOST_PTR` for the OpenGL backend
- implement drm format modifiers for vulkan
- add a new field `pl_fmt.modifiers` for DRM format modifier negotiation
- add new header &lt;libplacebo/shaders/lut.h&gt; to load custom LUTs
  (currently only supporting the .cube format)
- add `index_data/buf` to `pl_pass_run_params`, adding support for
  indexed vertex data when dispatching shader passes
- add `pl_dispatch_vertex` to allow dispatching fragment shaders using
  a list of custom vertices with custom vertex attributes
- add `pl_frame_recreate_from_avframe` and `pl_download_avframe` to help
  downloading GPU textures back into AVFrame form
- add a new header &lt;libplacebo/utils/frame_queue.h&gt; to assist in taking
  a stream of (Frame, PTS) pairs as well as a list of VSync times and
  turning them into a stream of `pl_frame_mix` structs
- add `pl_white_from_temp` and `pl_color_adjustment.temperature` to
  apply white point adjustments between correlated color temperatures (K)
- add `pl_filter_preset.description` containing a longer, human-readable
  name for a given filter preset
Changes:
- `pl_3dlut_params` has been renamed `pl_icc_params`
- `pl_render_params.force_3dlut` has been renamed `force_icc_lut`
- `pl_3dlut_update/apply` have been renamed to `pl_icc_update/apply` and
  moved to a (conditionally installed) new header &lt;libplacebo/shaders/icc.h&gt;
- `pl_upload_plane` no longer initializes `out_plane-&gt;shift_x/y` to 0,
  instead leaving them unmodified (to avoid clobbering existing shift data)
- `pl_filter_box` has been renamed to `pl_filter_nearest`
- `pl_filter_triangle` has been renamed to `pl_filter_bilinear`
- `pl_render_params.frame_mixer = NULL` now disables frame mixing - to
  get back the old behaviour, set this to `&amp;pl_oversample_frame_mixer`.
- `pl_color_map_params.gamut_warning` now highlights out-of-gamut colors
  in bright pink, rather than the old (ill-defined) inversion behaviour
- `pl_named_filter_config` has been renamed to `pl_filter_preset`
- `pl_find_named_filter` has been renamed to `pl_find_filter_preset`
- ditto for `pl_named_filter_function` and `pl_filter_function_preset`
Fixes and performance improvements:
- fix buffer overflow in custom shader STORAGE blocks
- fix include path for glslang &gt;= 11.0.0
- actually enable shader subgroup operations for HDR peak detection
- fix locale dependence of shader parsing primitives
- fix AVCOL_SPC_SMPTE170M mapping
- fix wrong color space selection in `pl_vulkan_create_swapchain`
- work-around low UBO size limits on some platforms
- fix compilation issues on C++ due to the use of reserved identifiers
- fix `pl_get_detected_peak` on platforms without host-visible SSBOs
- fix edge case in vulkan texture handle capabilities check
- fix suboptimal mutex destruction code
- skip peak detection when outputting to HDR displays
- fix edge cases in shader LUT type selection logic
- avoid redundant scaling passes when scaling anamorphic content
- merge similar planes before dispatching heavy shaders (e.g.
  debanding, hooks)
- avoid scaling passes for certain small fractional scaling steps
- entirely avoid processing unneeded components when dispatching scalers
- avoid using more components than necessary for intermediate FBOs
- fix out-of-bounds read for small non-cropped emulated textures
- avoid thrashing the shader cache when reinitializing OpenGL FBOs
- fix incorrect include in &lt;libplacebo/opengl.h&gt;
- fix vk.xml priority issue on windows
- fix undefined behaviour / GPU hangs in HDR peak detection shader
- fix incorrect forwarding of DRM modifiers to the OpenGL backend
- fix crash on AV_PIX_FMT_FLAG_BAYER
- fix various compilation issues on certain platforms
- fix obscure edge-case in floating point printing routine
- `pl_render_params.force_icc_lut` now excludes no-op cases
- fix handling of custom shader COMPUTE blocks
- correctly apply hue and saturation controls for non-YCbCr color spaces

    <comment>- Update libplacebo to version 3.120.3:
This minor release fixes a number of regressions surrounding memory
imports and DRM modifiers, specifically aimed at issues that arose with
mpv's --hwdec=vaapi.
Changes:
- `pl_fmt.modifiers` now always includes DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID on
   OpenGL, which instructs the implementation to not specify modifiers
- passing a DRM modifier not in the list of supported modifiers is now
  considered a hard error, to rule out non-working hwaccel formats
Fixes:
- fix a crash when using sampling shaders on textures with unknown formats
- fix improperly specified SDL header imports in the demos
- fix an issue where the vulkan texture handle capabilities were testing
  for presence of the wrong extension
- fix an issue where non-enabled DRM modifier structs were accidentally
  linked into the pNext chain, causing issues with some drivers</comment>
