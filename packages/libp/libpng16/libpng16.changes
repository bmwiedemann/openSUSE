  * Added PNGMINUS_UNUSED macro to contrib/pngminus/p*.c and added
    missing parenthesis in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c
  * Fixed off-by-one error in png_do_check_palette_indexes()
  * Initialize png_handler.row_ptr in libpng_read_fuzzer.cc
    to fix shortlived oss-fuzz issue 3234.
  * Compute a larger limit on IDAT because some applications write
    a deflate buffer for each row
  * Use current date (DATE) instead of release-date (RDATE) in last
    changed date of contrib/oss-fuzz files.
  * Enabled ARM support in CMakeLists.txt
  * Fixed incorrect typecast of some arguments to png_malloc() and
    png_calloc() that were png_uint_32 instead of png_alloc_size_t
  * Use pnglibconf.h.prebuilt when building for ANDROID with cmake
  * Initialize memory allocated by png_inflate to zero, using
    memset, to stop an oss-fuzz "use of uninitialized value"
    detection in png_set_text_2() due to truncated iTXt or zTXt
    chunk.
  * Initialize memory allocated by png_read_buffer to zero, using
    memset, to stop an oss-fuzz "use of uninitialized value"
    detection in png_icc_check_tag_table() due to truncated iCCP
    chunk.
  * Removed redundant tests
  * Added an interlaced version of each file in contrib/pngsuite.
  * Relocate new memset() call in pngrutil.c
  * Add support for loading images with associated alpha in the
    Simplified API
  * Revert contrib/oss-fuzz/libpng_read_fuzzer.cc to libpng-1.6.32
    state

  * Add end_info structure and png_read_end() to the libpng fuzzer
- includes 1.6.32:
  * Avoid possible NULL dereference in png_handle_eXIf when
    benign_errors are allowed. Avoid leaking the input buffer
    "eXIf_buf".
  * Eliminated png_ptr->num_exif member from pngstruct.h and added
    num_exif to arguments for png_get_eXIf() and png_set_eXIf().
  * Added calls to png_handle_eXIf(() in pngread.c and
    png_write_eXIf() in pngwrite.c, and made various other fixes
    to png_write_eXIf().
  * Changed name of png_get_eXIF and png_set_eXIf() to
    png_get_eXIf_1() and png_set_eXIf_1(), respectively, to avoid
    breaking API compatibility with libpng-1.6.31.
  * Updated contrib/libtests/pngunknown.c with eXIf chunk.
  * Initialized btoa[] in pngstest.c
  * Stop memory leak when returning from png_handle_eXIf() with an
    error
  * Replaced local eXIf_buf with info_ptr-eXIf_buf in png_handle_eXIf().
  * Update libpng.3 and libpng-manual.txt about eXIf functions.
  * Restored png_get_eXIf() and png_set_eXIf() to maintain API
    compatability.
  * Removed png_get_eXIf_1() and png_set_eXIf_1().

    fix an OSS-fuzz issue (Fixes CVE-2017-12652)
  * Check length of IDAT against maximum possible IDAT size,
    accounting for height, rowbytes, interlacing and zlib/deflate
    overhead.
  * Restored png_get_eXIf_1() and png_set_eXIf_1(), because
    strlen(eXIf_buf) does not work (the eXIf chunk data can
    contain zeroes).
  * Revised symlink creation, no longer using deprecated cmake
    LOCATION feature
  * Fixed five-byte error in the calculation of IDAT maximum
    possible size.
  * Moved chunk-length check into a png_check_chunk_length()
    private function
  * Moved bad pngs from tests to contrib/libtests/crashers
  * Moved testing of bad pngs into a separate
    tests/pngtest-badpngs script
  * Added the --xfail (expected FAIL) option to pngtest.c. It
    writes XFAIL in the output but PASS for the libpng test.
  * Require cmake-3.0.2 in CMakeLists.txt
  * Fix "const" declaration info_ptr argument to png_get_eXIf_1()
    and the num_exif argument to png_get_eXIf_1()
  * Added "eXIf" to "chunks_to_ignore[]" in png_set_keep_unknown_chunks().
  * Added huge_IDAT.png and empty_ancillary_chunks.png to
    testpngs/crashers.
  * Make pngtest --strict, --relax, --xfail options imply -m
    (multiple).
  * Removed unused chunk_name parameter from png_check_chunk_length().
  * Relocated setting free_me for eXIf data, to stop an OSS-fuzz'
    leak.
  * Initialize profile_header[] in png_handle_iCCP() to fix
    OSS-fuzz issue.
  * Initialize png_ptr->row_buf[0] to 255 in png_read_row() to fix
    OSS-fuzz UMR.
  * Attempt to fix a UMR in png_set_text_2() to fix OSS-fuzz issue.
  * Increase minimum zlib stream from 9 to 14 in png_handle_iCCP(),
    to account for the minimum 'deflate' stream, and relocate the
    test to a point after the keyword has been read.
  * Check that the eXIf chunk has at least 2 bytes and begins with
    "II" or "MM".
  * Added a set of "huge_xxxx_chunk.png" files to
    contrib/testpngs/crashers, one for each known chunk type, with
    length = 2GB-1.
  * Check for 0 return from png_get_rowbytes() and added some
    (size_t) typecasts in contrib/pngminus/*.c to stop some Coverity
    issues (162705, 162706, and 162707).
  * Renamed chunks in contrib/testpngs/crashers to avoid having
    files whose names differ only in case; this causes problems with
    some platforms
  * Added contrib/oss-fuzz directory which contains files used by
    the oss-fuzz project

  Revised documentation of png_get_error_ptr() in the libpng manual.
  Document need to check for integer overflow when allocating a pixel
    buffer for multiple rows in contrib/gregbook, contrib/pngminus,
    example.c, and in the manual (suggested by Jaeseung Choi). This
    is similar to the bug reported against pngquant in CVE-2016-5735.
  Check for integer overflow in contrib/visupng and contrib/tools/genpng.
  Do not double evaluate CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR in CMakeLists.txt.
  Avoid writing an empty IDAT when the last IDAT exactly fills the
    compression buffer (bug report by Brian Baird).  This bug was
    introduced in libpng-1.6.0.
  Add a reference to the libpng.download site in README.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Oct 20 06:12:20 UTC 2016 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.6.26:
  Fixed handling zero length IDAT in pngfix (bug report by Agostino Sarubbo,
    bugfix by John Bowler).
  Do not issue a png_error() on read in png_set_pCAL() because
    png_handle_pCAL has allocated memory that libpng needs to free.
  Issue a png_benign_error instead of a png_error on ADLER32 mismatch
    while decoding compressed data chunks.
  Changed PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM to ZLIB_VERNUM in pngpriv.h, pngstruct.h, and
    pngrutil.c.
  If CRC handling of critical chunks has been set to PNG_CRC_QUIET_USE,
    ignore the ADLER32 checksum in the IDAT chunk as well as the chunk CRCs.
  Issue png_benign_error() on ADLER32 checksum mismatch instead of
    png_error().
  Updated the documentation about CRC and ADLER32 handling.
  Fixed offsets in contrib/intel/intel_sse.patch
  Changed integer constant 4294967294 to unsigned 4294967294U in pngconf.h
    to avoid a signed/unsigned compare in the preprocessor.
  Use zlib-1.2.8.1 inflateValidate() instead of inflateReset2() to
    optionally avoid ADLER32 evaluation.

  * Fixes a potential memleak in png_set_tRNS.
  * Fixed the progressive reader to handle empty first IDAT
    chunk properly.
  * Added tests in pngvalid.c to check zero-length IDAT chunks
    in various positions.
  * Fixed the sequential reader to handle these more robustly.
  * Corrected progressive read input buffer in pngvalid.c.
  * Moved sse2 prototype from pngpriv.h to
    contrib/intel/intel_sse.patch.
  * Fixed undefined behavior in png_push_save_buffer().
    Do not call memcpy() with a null source, even if count is zero.
  * Fixed bad link to RFC2083 in png.5.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 26 14:55:11 UTC 2016 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.6.22:
  Added a png_image_write_to_memory() API and a number of assist macros
    to allow an application that uses the simplified API write to bypass
    stdio and write directly to memory.
  Relaxed limit checks on gamma values in pngrtran.c. As suggested in
    the comments gamma values outside the range currently permitted
    by png_set_alpha_mode are useful for HDR data encoding.  These values
    are already permitted by png_set_gamma so it is reasonable caution to
    extend the png_set_alpha_mode range as HDR imaging systems are starting
    to emerge.
  Restored "& 0xff" in png_save_uint_16() and png_save_uint_32() that
    were accidentally removed from libpng-1.6.17.
  Changed PNG_INFO_cHNK and PNG_FREE_cHNK from 0xnnnn to 0xnnnnU in png.h
    (Robert C. Seacord).
  Added INTEL-SSE2 support (Mike Klein and Matt Sarett, Google, Inc.).
  SSE filter speed improvements for bpp=3:
    memcpy-free implementations of load3() / store3().
  Added PNG_FAST_FILTERS macro (defined as
    PNG_FILTER_NONE|PNG_FILTER_SUB|PNG_FILTER_UP).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 17 14:10:43 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.21
* Widened the 'limit' check on the internally calculated error limits in
  the 'DIGITIZE' case (the code used prior to 1.7 for rgb_to_gray error
  checks) and changed the check to only operate in non-release builds
  (base build type not RC or RELEASE.)
* Fixed undefined behavior in pngvalid.c, undefined because
  (png_byte) << shift is undefined if it changes the signed bit
  (because png_byte is promoted to int). The libpng exported functions
  png_get_uint_32 and png_get_uint_16 handle this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  3 15:11:03 UTC 2015 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.6.20:
  Avoid potential pointer overflow/underflow in png_handle_sPLT() and
    png_handle_pCAL() (Bug report by John Regehr).
  Fixed incorrect implementation of png_set_PLTE() that uses png_ptr
    not info_ptr, that left png_set_PLTE() open to the CVE-2015-8126
    vulnerability.
  Backported tests from libpng-1.7.0beta69.
  Fixed an error in handling of bad zlib CMINFO field in pngfix, found by
    American Fuzzy Lop, reported by Brian Carpenter.  inflate() doesn't
    immediately fault a bad CMINFO field; instead a 'too far back' error
    happens later (at least some times).  pngfix failed to limit CMINFO to
    the allowed values but then assumed that window_bits was in range,
    triggering an assert. The bug is mostly harmless; the PNG file cannot
    be fixed.
  In libpng 1.6 zlib initialization was changed to use the window size
    in the zlib stream, not a fixed value. This causes some invalid images,
    where CINFO is too large, to display 'correctly' if the rest of the
    data is valid.  This provides a workaround for zlib versions where the
    error arises (ones that support the API change to use the window size
    in the stream).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 07:25:01 UTC 2015 - pgajdos@suse.com

- update to 1.6.19:
  Fixed potential leak of png_pixels in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c
  Fixed uninitialized variable in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
  Fixed the recently reported 1's complement security issue.
  Fixed png_save_int_32 when int is not 2's complement by replacing
    the value that is illegal in the PNG spec, in both signed and 
    unsigned values, with 0.
 etc., see ANNOUNCE and CHANGES for details

Mon Mar 30 07:10:35 UTC 2015 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.6.17:
  Corrected the width limit calculation in png_check_IHDR().
  Removed user limits from pngfix. Also pass NULL pointers to
    png_read_row to skip the unnecessary row de-interlace stuff.
  Implement previously untested cases of libpng transforms in pngvalid.c
  Fixed byte order in 2-byte filler, in png_do_read_filler().
  Made the check for out-of-range values in png_set_tRNS() detect
    values that are exactly 2^bit_depth, and work on 16-bit platforms.
  Merged some parts of libpng-1.6.17beta01 and libpng-1.7.0beta47.
  Added #ifndef __COVERITY__ where needed in png.c, pngrutil.c and
    pngset.c to avoid warnings about dead code.
  Do not build png_product2() when it is unused.
  Display user limits in the output from pngtest.
  Eliminated the PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro and restored the 1-million-column
    and 1-million-row default limits in pnglibconf.dfa, that can be reset
    by the user at build time or run time.  This provides a more robust
    defense against DOS and as-yet undiscovered overflows.
  Added PNG_WRITE_CUSTOMIZE_COMPRESSION_SUPPORTED macro, on by default.
  Allow user to call png_get_IHDR() with NULL arguments (Reuben Hawkins).
  Moved png_set_filter() prototype into a PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED block
    of png.h.
  Free the unknown_chunks structure even when it contains no data.
  Fixed simplified 8-bit-linear to sRGB alpha. The calculated alpha
    value was wrong.  It's not clear if this affected the final stored
    value; in the obvious code path the upper and lower 8-bits of the
    alpha value were identical and the alpha was truncated to 8-bits
    rather than dividing by 257 (John Bowler).

    they can be masde static. Move the intrapixel functions and the
    grayscale palette builder out of the png?tran.c files. The latter
    isn't a transform function and is no longer used internally, and the
    former MNG specific functions are better placed in pngread/pngwrite.c
  Made transform implementation functions static. This makes the internal
    functions called by png_do_{read|write}_transformations static. On an
    x86-64 DLL build (Gentoo Linux) this reduces the size of the text
    segment of the DLL by 1208 bytes, about 0.6%. It also simplifies
    maintenance by removing the declarations from pngpriv.h and allowing
    easier changes to the internal interfaces.
  Rebuilt configure scripts with automake-1.14.1 and autoconf-2.69
    in the tar distributions.
  Added checks for libpng 1.5 to pngvalid.c.  This supports the use of
    this version of pngvalid in libpng 1.5
  Merged with pngvalid.c from libpng-1.7 changes to create a single
    pngvalid.c
  Merged pngrio.c, pngtrans.c, pngwio.c, and pngerror.c with libpng-1.7.0
  Merged libpng-1.7.0 changes to make no-interlace configurations work
    with test programs.
  Revised pngvalid.c to support libpng 1.5, which does not support the
    PNG_MAXIMUM_INFLATE_WINDOW option, so #define it out when appropriate
    in pngvalid.c
  Allow unversioned links created on install to be disabled in configure.
    In configure builds 'make install' changes/adds links like png.h
    and libpng.a to point to the newly installed, versioned, files (e.g.
    libpng17/png.h and libpng17.a). Three new configure options and some
    rearrangement of Makefile.am allow creation of these links to be
    disabled.
  Removed potentially misleading warning from png_check_IHDR().
  Updated scripts/makefile.* to use CPPFLAGS (Cosmin).
  Added clang attribute support (Cosmin).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 20 07:08:48 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.6.8:
  Changed #ifdef PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED in pngpread.c to
    #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED to be consistent with
    what is in pngpriv.h.
  Moved prototype for png_handle_unknown() in pngpriv.h outside of
    the #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED/#endif block.
  Enabled WRITE_INVERT and WRITE_PACK in contrib/pngminim/encoder.
  Fixed pngvalid 'fail' function declaration on the Intel C Compiler.
    This reverts to the previous 'static' implementation and works round
    the 'unused static function' warning by using PNG_UNUSED().
  Handle zero-length PLTE chunk or NULL palette with png_error()
    instead of png_chunk_report(), which by default issues a warning
    rather than an error, leading to later reading from a NULL pointer
    (png_ptr->palette) in png_do_expand_palette(). This is CVE-2013-6954
    and VU#650142.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 15 07:56:22 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.6.7:
  * Revised unknown chunk code to correct several bugs in the 
    NO_SAVE_/NO_WRITE combination
  * Check user callback behavior in pngunknown.c. Previous versions 
    compiled if SAVE_UNKNOWN was not available but did nothing since the 
    callback was never implemented.
  * Merged pngunknown.c with 1.7 version and back ported 1.7 
    improvements/fixes

  of malicuous images/files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 26 07:15:01 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.6.2:
  Updated documentation of 1.5.x to 1.6.x changes in iCCP chunk handling.
  Fixed incorrect warning of excess deflate data. End condition - the
    warning would be produced if the end of the deflate stream wasn't read
    in the last row.  The warning is harmless.
  Corrected the test on user transform changes on read. It was in the
    png_set of the transform function, but that doesn't matter unless the
    transform function changes the rowbuf size, and that is only valid if
    transform_info is called.
  Corrected a misplaced closing bracket in contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
    (Flavio Medeiros).
  Corrected length written to uncompressed iTXt chunks (Samuli Suominen).
  Added contrib/tools/fixitxt.c, to repair the erroneous iTXt chunk length
    written by libpng-1.6.0 and 1.6.1.
  Disallow storing sRGB information when the sRGB is not supported.
  Merge pngtest.c with libpng-1.7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 08:12:03 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.6.1:
  Made sRGB check numbers consistent.
  Use parentheses more consistently in "#if defined(MACRO)" tests.
  Reenabled code to allow zero length PLTE chunks for MNG.
  Fixed ALIGNED_MEMORY support.
  Avoid a possible memory leak in contrib/gregbook/readpng.c
  Better documentation of unknown handling API interactions.
  Corrected simplified API default gamma for color-mapped output, added
    a flag to change default. In 1.6.0 when the simplified API was used
    to produce color-mapped output from an input image with no gamma
    information the gamma assumed for the input could be different from
    that assumed for non-color-mapped output.  In particular 16-bit depth
    input files were assumed to be sRGB encoded, whereas in the 'direct'
    case they were assumed to have linear data.  This was an error.  The
    fix makes the simplified API treat all input files the same way and
    adds a new flag to the png_image::flags member to allow the
    application/user to specify that 16-bit files contain sRGB data
    rather than the default linear.

Mon Dec 19 08:24:37 UTC 2011 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.5.7:
  Added support for ARM processor (Mans Rullgard)
  Fixed bug in pngvalid on early allocation failure; fixed type cast in
    pngmem.c; pngvalid would attempt to call png_error() if the allocation
    of a png_struct or png_info failed. This would probably have led to a
    crash.  The pngmem.c implementation of png_malloc() included a cast
    to png_size_t which would fail on large allocations on 16-bit systems.
  Fix for the preprocessor of the Intel C compiler. The preprocessor
    splits adjacent @ signs with a space; this changes the concatentation
    token from @-@-@ to PNG_JOIN; that should work with all compiler
    preprocessors.
  Paeth filter speed improvements from work by Siarhei Siamashka. This
    changes the 'Paeth' reconstruction function to improve the GCC code
    generation on x86. The changes are only part of the suggested ones;
    just the changes that definitely improve speed and remain simple.
    The changes also slightly increase the clarity of the code.
  Check compression_type parameter in png_get_iCCP and remove spurious
    casts. The compression_type parameter is always assigned to, so must
    be non-NULL. The cast of the profile length potentially truncated the
    value unnecessarily on a 16-bit int system, so the cast of the (byte)
    compression type to (int) is specified by ANSI-C anyway.
  Fixed FP division by zero in pngvalid.c; the 'test_pixel' code left
    the sBIT fields in the test pixel as 0, which resulted in a floating
    point division by zero which was irrelevant but causes systems where
    FP exceptions cause a crash. Added code to pngvalid to turn on FP
    exceptions if the appropriate glibc support is there to ensure this is
    tested in the future.
  Updated scripts/pnglibconf.mak and scripts/makefile.std to handle the
    new PNG_JOIN macro.
  Added versioning to pnglibconf.h comments.
  Simplified read/write API initial version; basic read/write tested on
    a variety of images, limited documentation (in the header file.)
  Installed more accurate linear to sRGB conversion tables. The slightly
    modified tables reduce the number of 16-bit values that
    convert to an off-by-one 8-bit value.  The "makesRGB.c" code that was used
    to generate the tables is now in a contrib/sRGBtables sub-directory.

Thu Nov  3 09:10:05 UTC 2011 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.5.6:
  Fixed some 64-bit type conversion warnings in pngrtran.c
  Moved row_info from png_struct to a local variable.
  The various interlace mask arrays have been made into arrays of
    bytes and made PNG_CONST and static (previously some arrays were
    marked PNG_CONST and some weren't).
  Additional checks have been added to the transform code to validate the
    pixel depths after the transforms on both read and write.
  Removed some redundant code from pngwrite.c, in png_desgtroy_write_struct().
  Changed chunk reading/writing code to use png_uint_32 instead of png_byte[4].
    This removes the need to allocate temporary strings for chunk names on
    the stack in the read/write code.  Unknown chunk handling still uses the
    string form because this is exposed in the API.
  Added a note in the manual the png_read_update_info() must be called only
    once with a particular info_ptr.
  Revised test-pngtest.sh to report FAIL when pngtest fails.
  Added "--strict" option to pngtest, to report FAIL when the failure is
    only because the resulting valid files are different.
  Revised CMakeLists.txt to work with mingw and removed some material from
    CMakeLists.txt that is no longer useful in libpng-1.5.
  Fixed typo in Makefile.in and Makefile.am ("-M Wl" should be "-M -Wl")."
  Speed up png_combine_row() for interlaced images. This reduces the generality
    of the code, allowing it to be optimized for Adam7 interlace.  The masks
    passed to png_combine_row() are now generated internally, avoiding
    some code duplication and localizing the interlace handling somewhat.
  Align png_struct::row_buf - previously it was always unaligned, caused by
    a bug in the code that attempted to align it; the code needs to subtract
    one from the pointer to take account of the filter byte prepended to
    each row.
  Optimized png_combine_row() when rows are aligned. This gains a small
    percentage for 16-bit and 32-bit pixels in the typical case where the
    output row buffers are appropriately aligned. The optimization was not
    previously possible because the png_struct buffer was always misaligned.
  Removed two redundant tests for unitialized row.
  Fixed a relatively harmless memory overwrite in compressed text writing
    with a 1 byte zlib buffer.
  Add ability to call png_read_update_info multiple times to pngvalid.c
  Fixes for multiple calls to png_read_update_info. These fixes attend to
    most of the errors revealed in pngvalid, however doing the gamma work
    twice results in inaccuracies that can't be easily fixed.  There is now
    a warning in the code if this is going to happen.
  Turned on multiple png_read_update_info in pngvalid transform tests.
  Prevent libpng from overwriting unused bits at the end of the image when
    it is not byte aligned, while reading. Prior to libpng-1.5.6 libpng would
    overwrite the partial byte at the end of each row if the row width was not
    an exact multiple of 8 bits and the image is not interlaced.
  Made png_ptr->prev_row an aligned pointer into png_ptr->big_prev_row
    (Mans Rullgard).
  Changed misleading "Missing PLTE before cHRM" warning to "Out of place cHRM"
  Added PNG_LSR() and PNG_LSL() macros to defend against buggy compilers that
    evaluate non-taken code branches and complain about out-of-range shifts. 
  Renamed the local variable 'byte' because it appears in a MSYS header
    file.
  Added #define PNG_ALIGN_TYPE PNG_ALIGN_NONE to contrib/pngminim/*/pngusr.h

    because the ISO PNG specification has a typo in the tRNS table.
  * Changed several PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNK_SUPPORTED to
    PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED, to make the png_set_keep mechanism
    available for ignoring known chunks even when not saving unknown chunks.
  * Adopted preference for consistent use of "#ifdef" and "#ifndef" versus
    "#if defined()" and "if !defined()" where possible.
  * Added PNG_NO_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN in the PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED block of
    pngconf.h, and moved the various unknown chunk macro definitions
