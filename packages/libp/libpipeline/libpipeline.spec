%description
libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of
processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which
is often error-prone and insecure. This alleviates programmers of the
need to laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives
such as fork(2) and execve(2).
