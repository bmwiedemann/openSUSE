  <title>A pipeline manipulation library</title>
  <description>libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which is often error-prone and insecure.  This alleviates programmers of the need to laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives such as fork(2) and execve(2)</description>
