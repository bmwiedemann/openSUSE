  <description>libpathrs provides a set of utilities to help make path resolution within a
potentially-untrusted directory safe on Linux, as well as some specific helpers
for operating on /proc safely. The goal of this library is to help avoid the
relentless onslaught of security vulnerabilities in Linux system utilities
caused by bad path handling.
