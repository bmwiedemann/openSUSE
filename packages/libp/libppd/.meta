  <title>OpenPrinting libppd is a legacy support library for PPD files</title>
  <description>This package libppd provides the libppd library,
the legacy support library for PPD files, 
which is by 95% code overtaken from CUPS 2.x,
only what is needed to handle PPD files
(and also *.drv PPD generator files)
for retro-fitting legacy printer drivers.
As libppd is only for legacy PPD file support
no new features will be add to it.
The package libppd2 provides the actual libppd 2.x version library.
Both libppd and libppd2 are required by cups-filters2.
The sub-package libppd- provides development files for libppd.</description>
