%description
There are three main features of the C++ bindings to libpmemobj:

  * the `persistent_ptr<>` smart pointer,
  * the `transaction`, which comes in two flavours - scoped and closure,
  * the `p<>` property.

The main issue with the C API is a large set of macros and difficulty
in manual usage of `setjmp`.
