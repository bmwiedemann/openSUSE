- updated to 1.0.0
  * Compile with IPv6 support by default
  * Compile with large file support on by default
  * Add pcap-config script, which deals with -I/-L flags
    for compiling

  * Support for zerocopy BPF on platforms that support it
  * Better support for dealing with VLAN tagging/stripping on Linux
  * Fix dynamic library support on OSX
  * Return PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP if the interface isn't 'UP', so
    applications can print better diagnostic information
  * Return PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED if we don't have permission to open
    a device, so applications can tell the user they need to go play
    with permissions
  * On Linux, ignore ENETDOWN so we can continue to capture packets
    if the interface goes down and comes back up again.
  * On Linux, support new tpacket frame headers (2.6.27+)
  * On Mac OS X, add scripts for changing permissions on /dev/pbf* and
    launchd plist
  * On Solaris, support 'passive mode' on systems that support it
