%description
libraw1394 provides direct access to the connected 1394 buses to
userspace. Through this library, applications can directly send to
and receive from other nodes without requiring a kernel driver for
the protocol in question.

libraw1394 provides direct access to the connected 1394 buses to
userspace. Through this library, applications can directly send to
and receive from other nodes without requiring a kernel driver for
the protocol in question.

libraw1394 abstracts the interface that is used to communicate with
the kernel. It works with both the Juju stack (firewire-core.ko;
/dev/fw*; present since Linux kernel 2.6.22) and the old Linux1394
(raw1394.ko; /dev/raw1394; present until 2.6.36).
