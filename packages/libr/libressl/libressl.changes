Mon Dec 12 17:27:31 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.7.0
  * New features:
  * Added Ed25519 support both as a primitive and via OpenSSL's
    EVP interfaces.
  * X25519 is now also supported via EVP.
  * The OpenSSL 1.1 raw public and private key API is available
    with support for EVP_PKEY_ED25519, EVP_PKEY_HMAC and
    EVP_PKEY_X25519. Poly1305 is not currently supported via this
    interface.
  * Bug fixes:
  * Add EVP_chacha20_poly1305() to the list of all ciphers.
  * Avoid signed overflow in i2c_ASN1_BIT_STRING().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  1 12:35:37 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.6.1
  * Custom verification callbacks could cause the X.509 verifier
    to fail to store errors resulting from leaf certificate
    verification.
  * Unbreak ASN.1 indefinite length encoding.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  6 21:21:05 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.6.0
  * Avoid expensive RFC 3779 checks during cert verification.
  * The ASN.1 time parser has been refactored and rewritten using
    CBS. It has been made stricter in that it now enforces the
    rules from RFC 5280.
  * EVP API for HKDF ported from OpenSSL and subsequently cleaned
    up.
  * Add initial support for TS ESSCertIDv2 verification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 07:41:31 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.5.3
  * Fix d2i_ASN1_OBJECT(). A confusion of two CBS resulted in
    advancing the passed *der_in pointer incorrectly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 06:31:12 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to release 3.5.2:
  * New Features:
  * The RFC 3779 API was ported from OpenSSL. Many bugs were
    fixed, regression tests were added and the code was cleaned
    up.
  * Certificate Transparency was ported from OpenSSL. Many
    internal improvements were made, resulting in cleaner and
    safer code. Regress coverage was added. libssl does not yet
    make use of it.
  * Portable Improvements:
  * Fixed various POSIX compliance and other portability issues
    found by the port to the Sortix operating system.
  * Compatibility Changes:
  * Most structs that were previously defined in the following
    headers are now opaque as they are in OpenSSL 1.1: bio.h,
    bn.h, comp.h, dh.h, dsa.h, evp.h, hmac.h, ocsp.h, rsa.h,
    x509.h, x509v3.h, x509_vfy.h
  * Switch TLSv1.3 cipher names from AEAD- to OpenSSL's TLS_
    OpenSSL added the TLSv1.3 ciphersuites with "RFC names"
    instead of using something consistent with the previous
    naming. Various test suites expect these names (instead of
    checking for the much more sensible cipher numbers). The old
    names are still accepted as aliases.
  * Subject alternative names and name constraints are now
    validated when they are added to certificates. Various
    interoperability problems with stacks that validate
    certificates more strictly than OpenSSL can be avoided this
    way.
  * Attempt to opportunistically use the host name for SNI in
    s_client
- Rebase des-fcrypt.diff

  * Fixed: A stack overread could occur when checking X.509 name
    constraints.
  * Enable X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST by default in the legacy verifier.
    This compensates for the expiry of the DST Root X3 certificate.

- Update to release 3.3.3
  * Support for DTLSv1.2.
  * Continued rewrite of the record layer for the legacy stack.
  * Numerous bugs and interoperability issues were fixed in the
    new verifier. A few bugs and incompatibilities remain, so
    this release uses the old verifier by default.
  * The OpenSSL 1.1 TLSv1.3 API is not yet available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 21 12:59:31 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

    verifier causing issues with applications expecting behavior
    of the old verifier.
  * Unbreak DTLS retransmissions for flights that include a CCS.
  * Implement autochain for the TLSv1.3 server.
  * Use the legacy verifier for autochain.
  * Implement exporter for TLSv1.3.

  * Avoid an out-of-bounds write in BN_rand().
  * Fix numerous leaks in the UI_dup_* functions.
  * Avoid an out-of-bounds write in BN_rand().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 10:30:23 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.1.4
  * TLS 1.3 client improvements:
  * Improve client certificate selection to allow EC certificates
    instead of only RSA certificates.
  * Do not error out if a TLSv1.3 server requests an OCSP
    response as part of a certificate request.
  * Fix SSL_shutdown behavior to match the legacy stack. The
    previous behaviour could cause a hang.
  * Fix a memory leak and add a missing error check in the
    handling of the key update message.
  * Fix a memory leak in tls13_record_layer_set_traffic_key.
  * Avoid calling freezero with a negative size if a server sends
    a malformed plaintext of all zeroes.
  * Ensure that only PSS may be used with RSA in TLSv1.3 in order
    to avoid using PKCS1-based signatures.
  * Add the P-521 curve to the list of curves supported by
    default in the client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * A TLS client with peer verification disabled may crash when
    contacting a server that sends an empty certificate list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 10 23:43:18 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.1.1
  * Completed initial TLS 1.3 implementation with a completely
    new state machine and record layer. TLS 1.3 is now enabled by
    default for the client side, with the server side to be
    enabled in a future release. Note that the OpenSSL TLS 1.3
    API is not yet visible/available.
  * Improved cipher suite handling to automatically include
    TLSv1.3 cipher suites when they are not explicitly referred
    to in the cipher
    string.
  * Provided TLSv1.3 cipher suite aliases to match the names used
    in RFC 8446.
  * Added cms subcommand to openssl(1).
  * Added -addext option to openssl(1) req subcommand.
  * Added -groups option to openssl(1) s_server subcommand.
  * Added TLSv1.3 extension types to openssl(1) -tlsextdebug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 20 13:37:30 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 3.0.2
  * Use a valid curve when constructing an EC_KEY that looks like
    X25519. The recent EC group cofactor change results in
    stricter validation, which causes the EC_GROUP_set_generator()
    call to fail.
  * Fixed a padding oracle in PKCS7_dataDecode and
    CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey. (Note that the CMS code is currently
    disabled).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 13:45:30 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2.9.2

Thu Mar 14 21:30:46 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2.9.0
  * CRYPTO_LOCK is now automatically initialized, with the legacy
    callbacks stubbed for compatibility.
  * Added the SM3 hash function from the Chinese standard GB/T
    32905-2016.

  * Added support for assembly optimizations on 32-bit ARM ELF
    targets.
  * Improved protection against timing side channels in ECDSA
    signature generation.
  * Coordinate blinding was added to some elliptic curves. This
    is the last bit of the work by Brumley et al. to protect
    against the Portsmash vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 24 16:38:02 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- Update to new upstream release 2.8.3

    vectors, along with test harness fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 13 11:01:35 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2.8.1
 * Simplified key exchange signature generation and verification.
 * Fixed a one-byte buffer overrun in callers of
   EVP_read_pw_string.
 * Modified signature of CRYPTO_mem_leaks_* to return -1. This
   function is a no-op in LibreSSL, so this function returns an
   error to not indicate the (non-)existence of memory leaks.
 * SSL_copy_session_id, PEM_Sign, EVP_EncodeUpdate,
   BIO_set_cipher, X509_OBJECT_up_ref_count now return an int for
   error handling, matching OpenSSL.
 * Converted a number of #defines into proper functions, matching
   OpenSSL's ABI.
 * Added X509_get0_serialNumber from OpenSSL.
 * Removed EVP_PKEY2PKCS8_broken and PKCS8_set_broken, while
   adding PKCS8_pkey_add1_attr_by_NID and PKCS8_pkey_get0_attrs,
   matching OpenSSL.
 * Added RSA_meth_get_finish() RSA_meth_set1_name() from OpenSSL.
 * Added new EVP_CIPHER_CTX_(get|set)_iv() API that allows the IV
   to be retrieved and set with appropriate validation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 13:26:31 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.8.0
  * Fixed a pair of 20+ year-old bugs in X509_NAME_add_entry.
  * Tighten up checks for various X509_VERIFY_PARAM functions,
    'poisoning' parameters so that an unverified certificate
    cannot be used if it fails verification.
  * Fixed a potential memory leak on failure in ASN1_item_digest.
  * Fixed a potential memory alignment crash in
    asn1_item_combine_free.
  * Removed unused SSL3_FLAGS_DELAY_CLIENT_FINISHED and
    SSL3_FLAGS_POP_BUFFER flags in write path, simplifying IO
    paths.
  * Removed SSL_OP_TLS_ROLLBACK_BUG buggy client workarounds.
  * Added const annotations to many existing APIs from OpenSSL,
    making interoperability easier for downstream applications.
  * Added a missing bounds check in c2i_ASN1_BIT_STRING.
  * Removed three remaining single DES cipher suites.
  * Fixed a potential leak/incorrect return value in DSA
    signature generation.
  * Added a blinding value when generating DSA and ECDSA
    signatures, in order to reduce the possibility of a
    side-channel attack leaking the private key.
  * Added ECC constant time scalar multiplication support.
  * Revised the implementation of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 to match the
    specification in RFC 8017.
  * Changes from 2.7.4:
  * Avoid a timing side-channel leak when generating DSA and ECDSA
    signatures. [CVE-2018-12434, boo#1097779]
  * Reject excessively large primes in DH key generation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  2 20:59:44 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.7.2
  * Updated and added extensive new HISTORY sections to
    the API manuals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 26 11:27:48 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.7.1
  * Fixed a bug in int_x509_param_set_hosts, calling strlen() if
    name length provided is 0 to match the OpenSSL behaviour.
    [CVE-2018-8970, boo#1086778]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 12:03:54 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.7.0
  * Added support for many OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1 APIs.
  * Added support for automatic library initialization in
    libcrypto, libssl, and libtls.
  * Converted more packet handling methods to CBB, which improves
    resiliency when generating TLS messages.
  * Completed TLS extension handling rewrite, improving consistency
    of checks for malformed and duplicate extensions.
  * Rewrote ASN1_TYPE_ get,set _octetstring() using templated
    ASN.1. This removes the last remaining use of the old M_ASN1_
    macros (asn1_mac.h) from API that needs to continue to exist.
  * Added support for client-side session resumption in libtls.
  * A libtls client can specify a session file descriptor (a
    regular file with appropriate ownership and permissions) and
    libtls will manage reading and writing of session data across
    TLS handshakes.
  * Merged more DTLS support into the regular TLS code path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 00:51:03 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.4
  * Make tls_config_parse_protocols() work correctly when passed
    a NULL pointer for a protocol string.
  * Correct TLS extensions handling when no extensions are
    present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 20:30:57 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add extra-symver.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 23:42:59 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.3
  * Added support for providing CRLs to libtls - once a CRL is
    provided via tls_config_set_crl_file(3) or
    tls_config_set_crl_mem(3), CRL checking is enabled and
    required for the full certificate chain.
  * Reworked TLS certificate name verification code to more
    strictly follow RFC 6125.
  * Relaxed SNI validation to allow non-RFC-compliant clients
    using literal IP addresses with SNI to connect to a
    libtls-based TLS server.
  * Added tls_peer_cert_chain_pem() to libtls, useful in private
    certificate validation callbacks such as those in relayd.
  * Added SSL{,_CTX}_set_{min,max}_proto_version(3) functions.
  * Imported HKDF (HMAC Key Derivation Function) from BoringSSL.
  * Dropped cipher suites using DSS authentication.
  * Removed support for DSS/DSA from libssl.
  * Distinguish between self-issued certificates and self-signed
    certificates. The certificate verification code has special
    cases for self-signed certificates and without this change,
    self-issued certificates (which it seems are common place
    with openvpn/easyrsa) were also being included in this
    category.
  * Removed NPN support - NPN was never standardised and the last
    draft expired in October 2012.
  * Removed SSL_OP_CRYPTOPRO_TLSEXT_BUG workaround for old/broken
    CryptoPro clients.
  * Removed support for the TLS padding extension, which was
    added as a workaround for an old bug in F5's TLS termination.
  * Added ability to clamp notafter values in certificates for
    systems with 32-bit time_t. This is necessary to conform to
    RFC 5280 §4.1.2.5.
  * Removed the original (pre-IETF) chacha20-poly1305 cipher
    suites.
  * Reclassified ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA from HIGH to MEDIUM.
- Add des-fcrypt.diff [boo#1065363]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  2 21:20:42 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.2
  * Provide a useful error with libtls if there are no OCSP URLs
    in a peer certificate.
  * Keep track of which keypair is in use by a TLS context,
    fixing a bug where a TLS server with SNI would only return
    the OCSP staple for the default keypair.
- Update to new upstream release 2.6.1
  * Added tls_config_set_ecdhecurves() to libtls, which allows
    the names of the eliptical curves that may be used during
    client and server key exchange to be specified.
  * Removed support for DSS/DSA, since we removed the cipher
    suites a while back.
  * Removed NPN support. NPN was never standardised and the last
    draft expired in October 2012. ALPN was standardised.
  * Removed SSL_OP_CRYPTOPRO_TLSEXT_BUG workaround for old/broken
    CryptoPro clients.
  * Removed support for the TLS padding extension, which was
    added as a workaround for an old bug in F5's TLS
    termintation.
  * Added ability to clamp notafter values in certificates for
    systems with 32-bit time_t. This is necessary to conform to
    RFC 5280 §4.1.2.5.
  * Implemented the SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(3) API.
  * Removed the original (pre-IETF) chacha20-poly1305 cipher
    suites.
  * Reclassified ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA from HIGH to MEDIUM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  1 12:09:37 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.0
  * Added support for providing CRLs to libtls. Once a CRL is
    provided, we enable CRL checking for the full certificate
    chain.
  * Allow non-compliant clients using IP literal addresses with
    SNI to connect to a server using libtls.
  * Avoid a potential NULL pointer dereference in
    d2i_ECPrivateKey().
  * Added definitions for three OIDs used in EV certificates.
  * Plugged a memory leak in tls_ocsp_free.
  * Added tls_peer_cert_chain_pem, tls_cert_hash, and
    tls_hex_string to libtls, useful in private certificate
    validation callbacks.
  * Reworked TLS certificate name verification code to more
    strictly follow RFC 6125.
  * Added tls_keypair_clear_key for clearing key material.
  * Removed inconsistent IPv6 handling from
    BIO_get_accept_socket, simplified BIO_get_host_ip and
    BIO_accept.
  * Fixed the openssl(1) ca command so that is generates
    certificates with RFC 5280-conformant time.
  * Added ASN1_TIME_set_tm to set an asn1 from a struct tm *.
  * Added SSL{,_CTX}_set_{min,max}_proto_version() functions.
  * Added HKDF (HMAC Key Derivation Function) from BoringSSL
  * Providea a tls_unload_file() function that frees the memory
    returned from a tls_load_file() call, ensuring that it the
    contents become inaccessible. This is specifically needed on
    platforms where the library allocators may be different from
    the application allocator.
  * Perform reference counting for tls_config. This allows
    tls_config_free() to be called as soon as it has been passed
    to the final tls_configure() call, simplifying lifetime
    tracking for the application.
  * Moved internal state of SSL and other structures to be
    opaque.
  * Dropped cipher suites with DSS authentication.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 24 21:55:42 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.5.5
  * Distinguish between self-issued certificates and self-signed
    certificates. The certificate verification code has special
    cases for self-signed certificates and without this change,
    self-issued certificates (which it seems are common place
    with openvpn/easyrsa) were also being included in this
    category.

- Update to new upstream release 2.5.4
  * Reverted a previous change that forced consistency between
    return value and error code when specifing a certificate
    verification callback, since this breaks the documented API.
  * Switched Linux getrandom() usage to non-blocking mode,
    continuing to use fallback mechanims if unsuccessful.
  * Fixed a bug caused by the return value being set early to
    signal successful DTLS cookie validation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 12 09:03:36 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

    into an SSLv3/TLS connection.
  * Allowed protocols and ciphers to be set on a TLS config object
    in libtls.
- Update to new upstream release 2.5.3
  * Documentation updates
- Remove ecs.diff (merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 06:10:02 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.5.0
* libtls now supports ALPN and SNI
* libtls adds a new callback interface for integrating custom IO
  functions.
* libtls now handles 4 cipher suite groups: "secure"
  (TLSv1.2+AEAD+PFS), "compat" (HIGH:!aNULL), "legacy"
  (HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL), "insecure" (ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL). This
  allows for flexibility and finer grained control, rather than
  having two extremes.
* libtls now always loads CA, key and certificate files at the
  time the configuration function is called.
* Add support for OCSP intermediate certificates.
* Added functions used by stunnel and exim from BoringSSL - this
  brings in X509_check_host, X509_check_email, X509_check_ip, and
  X509_check_ip_asc.
* Improved behavior of arc4random on Windows when using memory
  leak analysis software.
* Correctly handle an EOF that occurs prior to the TLS handshake
  completing.
* Limit the support of the "backward compatible" ssl2 handshake
  to only be used if TLS 1.0 is enabled.
* Fix incorrect results in certain cases on 64-bit systems when
  BN_mod_word() can return incorrect results. BN_mod_word() now
  can return an error condition.
* Added constant-time updates to address CVE-2016-0702
* Fixed undefined behavior in BN_GF2m_mod_arr()
* Removed unused Cryptographic Message Support (CMS)
* More conversions of long long idioms to time_t
* Reverted change that cleans up the EVP cipher context in
  EVP_EncryptFinal() and EVP_DecryptFinal(). Some software relies
  on the previous behaviour.
* Avoid unbounded memory growth in libssl, which can be triggered
  by a TLS client repeatedly renegotiating and sending OCSP
  Status Request TLS extensions.
* Avoid falling back to a weak digest for (EC)DH when using SNI
  with libssl.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 10:29:40 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.4.2
* Ensured OSCP only uses and compares GENERALIZEDTIME values as
  per RFC6960. Also added fixes for OCSP to work with
  intermediate certificates provided in responses.
* Fixed incorrect results from BN_mod_word() when the modulus is
  too large.
* Correctly handle an EOF prior to completing the TLS handshake
  in libtls.
* Removed flags for disabling constant-time operations. This
  removes support for DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME,
  DH_FLAG_NO_EXP_CONSTTIME, and RSA_FLAG_NO_CONSTTIME flags,
  making all of these operations unconditionally constant-time.

- Update to new upstream release 2.3.2
* Added EVP_aead_chacha20_poly1305_ietf() which matches the AEAD
  construction introduced in RFC 7539, which is different than

Thu Sep 24 11:36:44 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.3.0
* SSLv3 is now permanently removed from the tree.
* libtls API: The read/write functions work correctly with external
  event libraries. See the tls_init man page for examples of using
  libtls correctly in asynchronous mode.
* When using tls_connect_fds, tls_connect_socket or tls_accept_fds,
  libtls no longer implicitly closes the passed in sockets. The
  caller is responsible for closing them in this case.
* Removed support for DTLS_BAD_VER. Pre-DTLSv1 implementations are
  no longer supported.
* SHA-0 is removed, which was withdrawn shortly after publication
  20 years ago.

Fri Mar  6 18:19:18 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.1.4:
  * Improvements to libtls:
    - a new API for loading CA chains directly from memory instead
      of a file, allowing verification with privilege separation in
      a chroot without direct access to CA certificate files.
    - Ciphers default to TLSv1.2 with AEAD and PFS.
    - Improved error handling and message generation.
    - New APIs and improved documentation.
  * Add X509_STORE_load_mem API for loading certificates from memory.
    This facilitates accessing certificates from a chrooted
    environment.
  * New AEAD "MAC alias" allows configuring TLSv1.2 AEAD ciphers by
    using 'TLSv1.2+AEAD' as the cipher selection string.
  * New openssl(1) command 'certhash' replaces the c_rehash script.
  * Server-side support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV for compatibility
    with various auditor and vulnerability scanners.
  * Dead and disabled code removal including MD5, Netscape
    workarounds, non-POSIX IO, SCTP, RFC 3779 support,
    "#if 0" sections, and more.
  * The ASN1 macros are expanded to aid readability and
    maintainability.
  * Various NULL pointer asserts removed in favor of letting the
    OS/signal handler catch them.
  * Refactored argument handling in openssl(1) for consistency and
    maintainability.
  * Support for building with OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED.
  * Dozens of issues found with the Coverity scanner fixed.
  * Fix a minor information leak that was introduced in t1_lib.c
    r1.71, whereby an additional 28 bytes of .rodata (or .data) is
    provided to the network. In most cases this is a non-issue
    since the memory content is already public.
  * Fixes for the following low-severity issues were integrated
    into LibreSSL from OpenSSL 1.0.1k:
    - CVE-2015-0205 - DH client certificates accepted without
      verification.
    - CVE-2014-3570 - Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results.
    - CVE-2014-8275 - Certificate fingerprints can be modified.
    - CVE-2014-3572 - ECDHE silently downgrades to ECDH [Client].
