Sun Jan 29 12:09:44 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.2:
  * OffsetFetch Protocol Update (#3995).
  * Add Consumer Group operations to Admin API (started by @lesterfan, #3995).
  * Allow listing consumer groups per state (#3995).
  * Partially implemented: support for AlterConsumerGroupOffsets
  * OpenSSL 3.0.x support - the maximum bundled OpenSSL version is now 3.0.7 (previously 1.1.1q).
  * Fixes to the transactional and idempotent producer.
  * The introduction of OpenSSL 3.0.x in the self-contained librdkafka
    bundles changes the default set of available ciphers, in particular all obsolete
    or insecure ciphers and algorithms as listed in the OpenSSL legacy
    manual page are now disabled by default.
    Should you need to use any of these old ciphers you'll need to
    explicitly enable the `legacy` provider by configuring
    `ssl.providers=default,legacy` on the librdkafka client.
    OpenSSL 3.0.x deprecates the use of engines, which is being replaced by
    providers. As such librdkafka will emit a deprecation warning if
    `ssl.engine.location` is configured. OpenSSL providers may be
    configured with the new `ssl.providers` configuration property.
    The default value for `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` has been
    changed from `none` (no hostname verification) to `https`, which enables
    broker hostname verification (to counter man-in-the-middle
    impersonation attacks) by default.  To restore the previous behaviour, set
    `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` to `none`.
  * The Consumer Batch APIs `rd_kafka_consume_batch()` and
    `rd_kafka_consume_batch_queue()` are not thread safe if 
    `rkmessages_size` is greater than 1 and any of the **seek**,
    **pause**, **resume** or **rebalancing** operation is performed in
    parallel with any of the above APIs. Some of the messages might be
    lost, or erroneously returned to the application, in the above scenario.
  * It is strongly recommended to use the Consumer Batch APIs and the
    mentioned operations in sequential order in order to get consistent result.
  * For **rebalancing** operation to work in sequencial manner, please set
    `rebalance_cb` configuration property (refer
    [examples/rdkafka_complex_consumer_example.c]
  * (examples/rdkafka_complex_consumer_example.c) for the help with the
    usage) for the consumer.
  * Added `rd_kafka_sasl_set_credentials()` API to update SASL credentials.
  * Setting `allow.auto.create.topics` will no longer give a warning if used
    by a producer, since that is an expected use case.  Improvement in
    documentation for this property.
  * Added a `resolve_cb` configuration setting that permits using custom
    DNS resolution logic.
  * Added `rd_kafka_mock_broker_error_stack_cnt()`.
  * The librdkafka.redist NuGet package has been updated to have fewer external
    dependencies for its bundled librdkafka builds, as everything but cyrus-sasl
    is now built-in. There are bundled builds with and without linking to
    cyrus-sasl for maximum compatibility.
  * Admin API DescribeGroups() now provides the group instance id
    for static members KIP-345 (#3995).
  * Fixed memory leak when loading SSL certificates (@Mekk, #3930)
  * Load all CA certificates from `ssl.ca.pem`, not just the first one.
  * Each HTTP request made when using OAUTHBEARER OIDC would leak a small
    amount of memory.
  * When a PID epoch bump is requested and the producer is waiting
    to reconnect to the transaction coordinator, a failure in a find coordinator
    request could cause an assert to fail. This is fixed by retrying when the
    coordinator is known (#4020).
  * Transactional APIs (except `send_offsets_for_transaction()`) that
    timeout due to low timeout_ms may now be resumed by calling the same API
    again, as the operation continues in the background.
  * For fatal idempotent producer errors that may be recovered by bumping the
    epoch the current transaction must first be aborted prior to the epoch bump.
    This is now handled correctly, which fixes issues seen with fenced
    transactional producers on fatal idempotency errors.
  * Timeouts for EndTxn requests (transaction commits and aborts) are now
    automatically retried and the error raised to the application is also
    a retriable error.
  * TxnOffsetCommitRequests were retried immediately upon temporary errors in
    `send_offsets_to_transactions()`, causing excessive network requests.
    These retries are now delayed 500ms.
  * If `init_transactions()` is called with an infinite timeout (-1),
    the timeout will be limited to 2 * `transaction.timeout.ms`.
    The application may retry and resume the call if a retriable error is
    returned.
  * Back-off and retry JoinGroup request if coordinator load is in progress.
  * Fix `rd_kafka_consume_batch()` and `rd_kafka_consume_batch_queue()` skipping
    other partitions' offsets intermittently when **seek**, **pause**, **resume**
    or **rebalancing** is used for a partition.
  * Fix `rd_kafka_consume_batch()` and `rd_kafka_consume_batch_queue()`
    intermittently returing incorrect partitions' messages if **rebalancing**
   happens during these operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 12 19:42:28 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.2:
  * Added KIP-768 OUATHBEARER OIDC support (by @jliunyu, #3560)
  * Added KIP-140 Admin API ACL support (by @emasab, #2676)
  * Consumer:
    `rd_kafka_offsets_store()` (et.al) will now return an error for any
    partition that is not currently assigned (through `rd_kafka_*assign()`).
    This prevents a race condition where an application would store offsets
    after the assigned partitions had been revoked (which resets the stored
    offset), that could cause these old stored offsets to be committed later
    when the same partitions were assigned to this consumer again - effectively
    overwriting any committed offsets by any consumers that were assigned the
    same partitions previously. This would typically result in the offsets
    rewinding and messages to be reprocessed.
    As an extra effort to avoid this situation the stored offset is now
    also reset when partitions are assigned (through `rd_kafka_*assign()`).
    Applications that explicitly call `..offset*_store()` will now need
    to handle the case where `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__STATE` is returned
    in the per-partition `.err` field - meaning the partition is no longer
    assigned to this consumer and the offset could not be stored for commit.
  * Improved producer queue scheduling. Fixes the performance regression
    introduced in v1.7.0 for some produce patterns. (#3538, #2912)
  * Windows: Added native Win32 IO/Queue scheduling. This removes the
    internal TCP loopback connections that were previously used for timely
    queue wakeups.
  * Added `socket.connection.setup.timeout.ms` (default 30s).
    The maximum time allowed for broker connection setups (TCP connection as
    well as SSL and SASL handshakes) is now limited to this value.
    This fixes the issue with stalled broker connections in the case of network
    or load balancer problems.
    The Java clients has an exponential backoff to this timeout which is
    limited by `socket.connection.setup.timeout.max.ms` - this was not
    implemented in librdkafka due to differences in connection handling and
    `ERR__ALL_BROKERS_DOWN` error reporting. Having a lower initial connection
    setup timeout and then increase the timeout for the next attempt would
    yield possibly false-positive `ERR__ALL_BROKERS_DOWN` too early.
  * SASL OAUTHBEARER refresh callbacks can now be scheduled for execution
    on librdkafka's background thread. This solves the problem where an
    application has a custom SASL OAUTHBEARER refresh callback and thus needs to
    call `rd_kafka_poll()` (et.al.) at least once to trigger the
    refresh callback before being able to connect to brokers.
    With the new `rd_kafka_conf_enable_sasl_queue()` configuration API and
    `rd_kafka_sasl_background_callbacks_enable()` the refresh callbacks
    can now be triggered automatically on the librdkafka background thread.
  * `rd_kafka_queue_get_background()` now creates the background thread
    if not already created.
  * Added `rd_kafka_consumer_close_queue()` and `rd_kafka_consumer_closed()`.
    This allow applications and language bindings to implement asynchronous
    consumer close.
  * Bundled zlib upgraded to version 1.2.12.
  * Bundled OpenSSL upgraded to 1.1.1n.
  * Added `test.mock.broker.rtt` to simulate RTT/latency for mock brokers.
- enable libcurl integration
- enable RapidJSON integration

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 22:51:56 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8.2:
  * Added ssl.ca.pem to add CA certificate by PEM string
  * Upon quick repeated leader changes the transactional producer could receive
    an OUT_OF_ORDER_SEQUENCE error from the broker 
  * The transactional producer could stall during a transaction if the transaction
    coordinator changed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 16 10:20:58 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.8.0:
 * Upgrade bundled zlib version from 1.2.8 to 1.2.11 in the `librdkafka.redist`
   NuGet package. The updated zlib version fixes CVEs:
   CVE-2016-9840, CVE-2016-9841, CVE-2016-9842, CVE-2016-9843
   See https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/issues/2934 for more information.
 * librdkafka now uses [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) for up-to-date Windows
   dependencies in the `librdkafka.redist` NuGet package:
   OpenSSL 1.1.1l, zlib 1.2.11, zstd 1.5.0.
 * The upstream dependency (OpenSSL, zstd, zlib) source archive checksums are
   now verified when building with `./configure --install-deps`.
   These builds are used by the librdkafka builds bundled with
   confluent-kafka-go, confluent-kafka-python and confluent-kafka-dotnet.
 * Producer `flush()` now overrides the `linger.ms` setting for the duration
   of the `flush()` call, effectively triggering immediate transmission of
   queued messages. (#3489)
 * Lots of bugfixes, see included CHANGELOG.md for details
- build against system libraries rather than bundled ones
- enable all features

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 11:34:21 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.7.0:
 * [KIP-360](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=89068820) - Improve reliability of transactional producer.
   Requires Apache Kafka 2.5 or later.
 * OpenSSL Engine support (`ssl.engine.location`) by @adinigam and @ajbarb.
 * Added `connections.max.idle.ms` to automatically close idle broker
   connections.
   This feature is disabled by default unless `bootstrap.servers` contains
   the string `azure` in which case the default is set to <4 minutes to improve
   connection reliability and circumvent limitations with the Azure load
   balancers (see #3109 for more information).
 * Bumped to OpenSSL 1.1.1k in binary librdkafka artifacts.
 * The binary librdkafka artifacts for Alpine are now using Alpine 3.12.
   OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
 * Improved static librdkafka Windows builds using MinGW (@neptoess, #3130).
 * The C++ `oauthbearer_token_refresh_cb()` was missing a `Handle *`
   argument that has now been added. This is a breaking change but the original
   function signature is considered a bug.
   This change only affects C++ OAuth developers.
 * [KIP-735](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-735%3A+Increase+default+consumer+session+timeout) The consumer `session.timeout.ms`
   default was changed from 10 to 45 seconds to make consumer groups more
   robust and less sensitive to temporary network and cluster issues.
 * Statistics: `consumer_lag` is now using the `committed_offset`,
   while the new `consumer_lag_stored` is using `stored_offset`
   (offset to be committed).
   This is more correct than the previous `consumer_lag` which was using
   either `committed_offset` or `app_offset` (last message passed
   to application).
  * Bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 26 09:15:38 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.6.1:
  * Fatal idempotent producer errors are now also fatal to the transactional
   producer. This is a necessary step to maintain data integrity prior to
   librdkafka supporting KIP-360. Applications should check any transactional
   API errors for the is_fatal flag and decommission the transactional producer
   if the flag is set.
  * The consumer error raised by `auto.offset.reset=error` now has error-code
   set to `ERR__AUTO_OFFSET_RESET` to allow an application to differentiate
   between auto offset resets and other consumer errors.
  * Admin API and transactional `send_offsets_to_transaction()` coordinator
   requests, such as TxnOffsetCommitRequest, could in rare cases be sent
   multiple times which could cause a crash.
  * `ssl.ca.location=probe` is now enabled by default on Mac OSX since the
   librdkafka-bundled OpenSSL might not have the same default CA search paths
   as the system or brew installed OpenSSL. Probing scans all known locations.
  * Fatal idempotent producer errors are now also fatal to the transactional
   producer.
  * The transactional producer could crash if the transaction failed while
   `send_offsets_to_transaction()` was called.
  * Group coordinator requests for transactional
   `send_offsets_to_transaction()` calls would leak memory if the
   underlying request was attempted to be sent after the transaction had
   failed.
  * When gradually producing to multiple partitions (resulting in multiple
   underlying AddPartitionsToTxnRequests) sub-sequent partitions could get
   stuck in pending state under certain conditions. These pending partitions
   would not send queued messages to the broker and eventually trigger
   message timeouts, failing the current transaction. This is now fixed.
  * Committing an empty transaction (no messages were produced and no
   offsets were sent) would previously raise a fatal error due to invalid state
   on the transaction coordinator. We now allow empty/no-op transactions to
   be committed.
  * The consumer will now retry indefinitely (or until the assignment is changed)
   to retrieve committed offsets. This fixes the issue where only two retries
   were attempted when outstanding transactions were blocking OffsetFetch
   requests with `ERR_UNSTABLE_OFFSET_COMMIT`. #3265
  * [KIP-429 Incremental rebalancing](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-429%3A+Kafka+Consumer+Incremental+Rebalance+Protocol) with sticky
   consumer group partition assignor (KIP-54) (by @mhowlett).
  * [KIP-480 Sticky producer partitioning](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-480%3A+Sticky+Partitioner) (`sticky.partitioning.linger.ms`) -
   achieves higher throughput and lower latency through sticky selection
   of random partition (by @abbycriswell).
  * AdminAPI: Add support for `DeleteRecords()`, `DeleteGroups()` and
   `DeleteConsumerGroupOffsets()` (by @gridaphobe)
  * [KIP-447 Producer scalability for exactly once semantics](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-447%3A+Producer+scalability+for+exactly+once+semantics) -
   allows a single transactional producer to be used for multiple input
   partitions. Requires Apache Kafka 2.5 or later.
  * Transactional producer fixes and improvements, see **Transactional Producer fixes** below.
  * The [librdkafka.redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/librdkafka.redist/)
   NuGet package now supports Linux ARM64/Aarch64.
  * Sticky producer partitioning (`sticky.partitioning.linger.ms`) is
   enabled by default (10 milliseconds) which affects the distribution of
   randomly partitioned messages, where previously these messages would be
   evenly distributed over the available partitions they are now partitioned
   to a single partition for the duration of the sticky time
   (10 milliseconds by default) before a new random sticky partition
   is selected.
  * The new KIP-447 transactional producer scalability guarantees are only
   supported on Apache Kafka 2.5 or later, on earlier releases you will
   need to use one producer per input partition for EOS. This limitation
   is not enforced by the producer or broker.
  * Error handling for the transactional producer has been improved, see
   the **Transactional Producer fixes** below for more information.
  * KIP-107, KIP-204: AdminAPI: Added `DeleteRecords()` (by @gridaphobe).
  * KIP-229: AdminAPI: Added `DeleteGroups()` (by @gridaphobe).
  * KIP-496: AdminAPI: Added `DeleteConsumerGroupOffsets()`.
  * KIP-464: AdminAPI: Added support for broker-side default partition count
   and replication factor for `CreateTopics()`.
  * Windows: Added `ssl.ca.certificate.stores` to specify a list of
   Windows Certificate Stores to read CA certificates from, e.g.,
   `CA,Root`. `Root` remains the default store.
  * Use reentrant `rand_r()` on supporting platforms which decreases lock
   contention (@azat).
  * Added `assignor` debug context for troubleshooting consumer partition
   assignments.
  * Updated to OpenSSL v1.1.1i when building dependencies.
  * Update bundled lz4 (used when `./configure --disable-lz4-ext`) to v1.9.3
   which has vast performance improvements.
  * Added `rd_kafka_conf_get_default_topic_conf()` to retrieve the
   default topic configuration object from a global configuration object.
  * Added `conf` debugging context to `debug` - shows set configuration
   properties on client and topic instantiation. Sensitive properties
   are redacted.
  * Added `rd_kafka_queue_yield()` to cancel a blocking queue call.
  * Will now log a warning when multiple ClusterIds are seen, which is an
   indication that the client might be erroneously configured to connect to
   multiple clusters which is not supported.
  * Added `rd_kafka_seek_partitions()` to seek multiple partitions to
   per-partition specific offsets.
  * Fix a use-after-free crash when certain coordinator requests were retried.
  * The C++ `oauthbearer_set_token()` function would call `free()` on
   a `new`-created pointer, possibly leading to crashes or heap corruption (#3194)
  * The consumer assignment and consumer group implementations have been
   decoupled, simplified and made more strict and robust. This will sort out
   a number of edge cases for the consumer where the behaviour was previously
   undefined.
  * Partition fetch state was not set to STOPPED if OffsetCommit failed.
  * The session timeout is now enforced locally also when the coordinator
   connection is down, which was not previously the case.
  * Transaction commit or abort failures on the broker, such as when the
   producer was fenced by a newer instance, were not propagated to the
   application resulting in failed commits seeming successful.
   This was a critical race condition for applications that had a delay after
   producing messages (or sendings offsets) before committing or
   aborting the transaction. This issue has now been fixed and test coverage
   improved.
  * The transactional producer API would return `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__STATE`
   when API calls were attempted after the transaction had failed, we now
   try to return the error that caused the transaction to fail in the first
   place, such as `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__FENCED` when the producer has
   been fenced, or `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__TIMED_OUT` when the transaction
   has timed out.
  * Transactional producer retry count for transactional control protocol
   requests has been increased from 3 to infinite, retriable errors
   are now automatically retried by the producer until success or the
   transaction timeout is exceeded. This fixes the case where
   `rd_kafka_send_offsets_to_transaction()` would fail the current
   transaction into an abortable state when `CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` was
   returned by the broker (which is a transient error) and the 3 retries
   were exhausted.
  * Calling `rd_kafka_topic_new()` with a topic config object with
   `message.timeout.ms` set could sometimes adjust the global `linger.ms`
   property (if not explicitly configured) which was not desired, this is now
   fixed and the auto adjustment is only done based on the
   `default_topic_conf` at producer creation.
  * `rd_kafka_flush()` could previously return `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR__TIMED_OUT`
   just as the timeout was reached if the messages had been flushed but
   there were now no more messages. This has been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 22 09:26:30 UTC 2020 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.3:
 * Fix a use-after-free crash when certain coordinator requests were retried.
 * Consumer would not filter out messages for aborted transactions
   if the messages were compressed (#3020).
 * Consumer destroy without prior `close()` could hang in certain
   cgrp states (@gridaphobe, #3127).
 * Fix possible null dereference in `Message::errstr()` (#3140).
 * The `roundrobin` partition assignment strategy could get stuck in an
   endless loop or generate uneven assignments in case the group members
   had asymmetric subscriptions (e.g., c1 subscribes to t1,t2 while c2
   subscribes to t2,t3).  (#3159)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 26 08:08:55 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.2:
  * Security fixes: There was an incorrect call to zlib's inflateGetHeader()
  with unitialized memory pointers that could lead to the GZIP header of a
  fetched message batch to be copied to arbitrary memory. 
  * The default value for the producer configuration property retries has
  been increased from 2 to infinity
  * The default value for the producer configuration property
  request.timeout.ms has been increased from 5 to 30 seconds
  * lots of bugfixes, see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edenhill/librdkafka/v1.5.2/CHANGELOG.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 21 12:36:30 UTC 2020 - Chris Coutinho <chrisbcoutinho@gmail.com>

- Update library v1.3.0 -> 1.5.0
 * Improved broker connection error reporting with more useful information and
   hints on the cause of the problem.
 * Consumer: Propagate errors when subscribing to unavailable topics (#1540)
 * Producer: Add `batch.size` producer configuration property (#638)
 * Add `topic.metadata.propagation.max.ms` to allow newly manually created
   topics to be propagated throughout the cluster before reporting them
   as non-existent. This fixes race issues where CreateTopics() is
   quickly followed by produce().
 * Prefer least idle connection for periodic metadata refreshes, et.al.,
   to allow truly idle connections to time out and to avoid load-balancer-killed
   idle connection errors (#2845)
 * Added `rd_kafka_event_debug_contexts()` to get the debug contexts for
   a debug log line (by @wolfchimneyrock).
 * Added Test scenarios which define the cluster configuration.
 * Added MinGW-w64 builds (@ed-alertedh, #2553)
 * `./configure --enable-XYZ` now requires the XYZ check to pass,
   and `--disable-XYZ` disables the feature altogether (@benesch)
 * Added `rd_kafka_produceva()` which takes an array of produce arguments
   for situations where the existing `rd_kafka_producev()` va-arg approach
   can't be used.
 * Added `rd_kafka_message_broker_id()` to see the broker that a message
   was produced or fetched from, or an error was associated with.
 * Added RTT/delay simulation to mock brokers.
 * Subscribing to non-existent and unauthorized topics will now propagate
   errors `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR_UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PART` and
   `RD_KAFKA_RESP_ERR_TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` to the application through
   the standard consumer error (the err field in the message object).
 * Consumer will no longer trigger auto creation of topics,
   `allow.auto.create.topics=true` may be used to re-enable the old deprecated
   functionality.
 * The default consumer pre-fetch queue threshold `queued.max.messages.kbytes`
   has been decreased from 1GB to 64MB to avoid excessive network usage for low
   and medium throughput consumer applications. High throughput consumer
   applications may need to manually set this property to a higher value.
 * The default consumer Fetch wait time has been increased from 100ms to 500ms
   to avoid excessive network usage for low throughput topics.
 * If OpenSSL is linked statically, or `ssl.ca.location=probe` is configured,
   librdkafka will probe known CA certificate paths and automatically use the
   first one found. This should alleviate the need to configure
   `ssl.ca.location` when the statically linked OpenSSL's OPENSSLDIR differs
   from the system's CA certificate path.
 * The heuristics for handling Apache Kafka < 0.10 brokers has been removed to
   improve connection error handling for modern Kafka versions.
   Users on Brokers 0.9.x or older should already be configuring
   `api.version.request=false` and `broker.version.fallback=...` so there
   should be no functional change.
 * The default producer batch accumulation time, `linger.ms`, has been changed
   from 0.5ms to 5ms to improve batch sizes and throughput while reducing
   the per-message protocol overhead.
   Applications that require lower produce latency than 5ms will need to
   manually set `linger.ms` to a lower value.
 * librdkafka's build tooling now requires Python 3.x (python3 interpreter).

Wed Mar 25 22:10:10 UTC 2020 - R. Tyler Croy <rtyler@brokenco.de>

-  Add v1.3.0 which includes a number of properties and bugfixes over 1.1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 31 10:33:44 UTC 2019 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- lto breaks crc32 detection in configure script, so disable it
  for non x86_64 architectures.
  Reported upstream: https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/issues/2426

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  5 11:47:36 UTC 2019 - Thomas Bechtold <tbechtold@suse.com>

- update to 1.1.0:
  * SASL OAUTHBEARER support
  * In-memory SSL certificates (PEM, DER, PKCS#12) support
  * Pluggable broker SSL certificate verification callback
  * ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https (off by default) to validate
    the broker hostname matches the certificate. Requires OpenSSL >= 1.0.2.
  * Improved GSSAPI/Kerberos ticket refresh
  * SSL peer (broker) certificate verification is now enabled by default
    (disable with enable.ssl.certificate.verification=false)
  * %{broker.name} is no longer supported in sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd since
    kinit refresh is no longer executed per broker, but per client instance.
  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Don't run kinit refresh for each broker,
    just per client instance.
  * SASL GSSAPI/Kerberos: Changed sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd to first attempt
    ticket refresh, then acquire.
  * SASL: Proper locking on broker name acquisition.
  * Consumer: max.poll.interval.ms now correctly handles blocking poll calls,
    allowing a longer poll timeout than the max poll interval.
  * configure: Fix libzstd static lib detection
  * rdkafka_performance: Fix for Misleading "All messages delivered!" message

- update to version 1.0.1:
  * Fix consumer stall when broker connection goes down
  * Fix AdminAPI memory leak when broker does not support request
  * Update/fix protocol error response codes
  * Treat ECONNRESET as standard Disconnects

- update to version 1.0.0:
  * This release changes configuration defaults and deprecates a set
    of configuration properties, make sure to read the Upgrade considerations
    section from https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/releases/tag/v1.0.0
  * add support for Idempotent Producer, providing exactly-once
    producing and guaranteed ordering of messages.
  * In previous releases librdkafka would maintain open connections to all
    brokers in the cluster and the bootstrap servers.
    With this release librdkafka now connects to a single bootstrap server
