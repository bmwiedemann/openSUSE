  * IO:Re-grab SCE_KERNEL_ERROR_NOCWD.
  * IO:Add an extra delay to simulate umd delay in file seek whence.
  * vulkan: The GPU profiler could end up writing massive amounts of text, fix some bugs around that.
  * vulkan: ApplyRenderPassMerge; Add copy / blit destinations to touched buffers.
  * Vulkan: Enable renderpass merging for all games (was introduced in 1.9 for GoW games). A number of other games can also benefit.
  * Update lang submodule

  * Yet another gradle update
  * Fix vcrs disassembly
  * Oops
  * Isolate most of the softgpu specialization code to RasterizerRectangle.
  * Fix a backwards check
  * Remove unused textureswizzle support (we use shaders instead).  Universally support presenting 5551 format directly.
  * Hack around most of the problems with the save/load dialog. Software stretch gets enabled in non-wide mode, so wallpapers work at a cost of speed.
  * Scissor fix
  * Even more speed.
  * More speed
  * Buildfix
  * Further specialization.
  * More specialization work.
  * DarkStalkers: Fix display on OpenGL ES.
  * DarkStalkers: Fix display in the D3D backends. Still broken in OpenGL.
  * Darkstalkers: Gross hack to avoid the game's own stretch, and present the raw buffer instead for a sharper image.
  * More darkstalkers work
  * Detect sprite drawing (1:1 texture mapping), run a simpler function without the triangle state tracking.
  * SoftGPU: Detect through-mode rectangles from triangle strips
  * Software renderer: Use hardware color conversion on Vulkan in 5551 16-bit mode
  * Start slowly migrating from macros
  * Add a compat.ini flag for software rendering, use it to force on in Darkstalkers
  * Buildfix
  * Also rename the config setting to make sure it starts out off.
  * Cardboard VR: Add an on-screen VR OFF button. Enable Cardboard on iOS.
  * Revert "Remove Google Cardboard support. Fixes #11668"
  * Update lang submodule, adding Croatian, thanks to HilmBrala
  * Text drawing fixes
  * Correct the wrong GL DataFormat enums
  * GL: remove another unused format
  * Reduce GL texture format support to the ES minimum. We have to handle these anyway so let's only have one path.
  * OpenGL dataformat cleanup - pass Draw::DataFormat to the GLRenderManager.
  * Fix the build - there's a Vec3 name collision, fixed it using a namespace.
  * Vulkan+SoftwareRenderer: Fix screen rotation on Android.
  * Io: Consistently use error codes with OpenFile().
  * Io: Return error code for write attempt to UMD.
  * Io: Change async thread priority if running.
  * Io: Destroy async threads on reset.
  * Vulkan: Add checks so we don't try to write NULL objects to a descriptor set.
  * Change Bloom Hack aggressive detection to include GOW games bloom.
  * Use old jit enablement method if clean method fails
  * HLE: Replace Motorstorm pixel read func.
  * Make style more consistent
  * Update ab.cmd
  * group chat options and set enabled ptr

  * Android chat empty after : fix
  * pointer and scroll fix
  * cmake buildfix
