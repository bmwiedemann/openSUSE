%description
PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded project, which
itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and PCSX-Revolution. This version is ARM
architecture oriented and features MIPS->ARM recompiler by Ari64, NEON GTE code
and more performance improvements. It was created for Pandora handheld, but should
be usable on other devices after some code adjustments (N900, GPH Wiz/Caanoo,
PlayBook versions are also available).

PCSX ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases produces pixel
perfect graphics at very high performance. There is also Una-i's GPU plugin from
PCSX4ALL project, and traditional P.E.Op.S. one.

This package is for RetroArch/Libretro front-end.
