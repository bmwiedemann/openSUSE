  - add burst support to the client API
  - wildcards are now supported in TLS name peer authentication

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 30 10:44:04 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- update to 1.1.3:
  - increased performance of RELP connection
  - bugfix: potential segfault if no GnuTLS priority string was set
- includes changes from 1.1.2:
  - add capability to specify the GnuTLS priority string
    This gives callers complete control over crypto parameters, like
    ciphers to use.
  - add certificate-based authentication
  - add capability to specify number of Diffie-Hellman bits to use
  - API extension: relpSrvSetDHBits, relpSrvSetGnuTLSPriString,
    relpSrvSetGnuTLSPriString, relpCltSetGnuTLSPriString
    relpEngineSetOnAuthErr, relpCltSetUsrPtr,
    relpSrvSetAuthMode, relpCltSetAuthMode
- includes changes from 1.1.1:
  - added compression support for TLS
  - API extension: relpCltEnableTLSZip, relpSrvEnableTLSZip
- includes changes from 1.1.0
  - add TLS support
-   new api for creating listners:
    ... which permits us to set various properties before the listener
    is actually started. New callers should use it. Sequence is:
    * relpEngineListnerConstruct()
    * ... set properties ... (via relpSrv...() family)
    * relgEngineListnerConstructFinalize()
    This new style permits us to add/set additional listner options
    without the need to introduce ever-new listner create functions.
    Actually, their number would grow exponentionally, so this were
    a dead end.
    The old-style APIs relpEngineAddListner() and
    relpEngineAddListner2() are still fully supported (and supposed
    to be for a long time), but flagged as deprecated.
- includes changes from 1.0.7:
  - ABI change: removed relpCltConnect2() API which was against
    librelp API philosophy
    This was only introduced in 1.0.6 and been in the code for a very
    short time. So we decided that the best thing to do is actually
    remove it (there is NO known released user, this changes was for
    yet unreleased rsyslog 7.5.0).
- includes changes from 1.0.6:
  - enhanced API to permit binding a client to a specific IP address
- includes changes from 1.0.5:
  - bugfix: compile problem on Solaris
- includes changes from 1.0.4:
  - bugfix: busy loop on syslog sending as a client when server did not
    accept data; this was broken out only when the remote peer
    indicated that the connection as whole was broken. Now we properly
    timeout.
- make -devel package require gnutls-devel to be useful

Wed Apr 14 09:42:37 UTC 2010 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.0
  This version of librelp matured in practice and it is now time
  for a 1.0 release. Besides that, it includes a small number of
  changes:
  - bugfix: user callback never received remote IP address
  - bugfix: offers builder did use a fixed size string without
    bounds checking. I don't think this was a real issue as it was
    not exposed to the outside world, but now the buffer
    dynamically grows (which is the right thing to do). Thank to
    mterry for alerting me.
- additional changes from version 0.1.3
  - the callback on message reception did not contain a way to pass
    on a caller cookie (e.g. for an instance pointer). An
    additional interface has been added to support that.
  - cleaned up FDL license specifics
  - added libtool versioning
  - made librelp compile out of the box on FreeBSD - thanks to
    Michael Biebl for the patch
- additional changes from version 0.1.2
  - forward compatibility changes in support of our plans to use
    the rsyslog runtime in the future
