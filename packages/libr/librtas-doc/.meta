  <title>Libraries to provide access to RTAS calls and RTAS events</title>
  <description>The librtas shared library provides userspace with an interface through
which certain RTAS calls can be made.  The library uses either of the
RTAS User Module or the RTAS system call to direct the kernel in making
these calls.

The librtasevent shared library provides users with a set of
definitions and common routines useful in parsing and dumping the
contents of RTAS events.</description>
