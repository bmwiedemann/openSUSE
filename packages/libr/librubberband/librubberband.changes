Wed Jul 23 12:05:30 UTC 2025 - Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.com>

- Disable BuildReq of sleef temporarily due to the build failures on TW;
  it can be reenabled later once after the build of sleef gets fixed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 10 07:25:59 UTC 2025 - Edgar Aichinger <edogawa@aon.at>

- Updated to 4.0.0
 * Add a new API, RubberBandLiveShifter, which is simpler to use
   than the general RubberBandStretcher interface in cases where only
   pitch-shifting is required. For more general purposes the original
   interface is still the proper one.
 * Fix incorrect URIs in LV2 plugins
 * Fix stack overflow in seldom used R2 time-domain smoothing code
 * Add support for key-frame maps (and the live shifter) to JNI interface
 * Fix some compatibility issues and warnings with certain compilers

- Updated to 3.3
 * Fix incorrect output with unexpectedly large buffers in process
 * Add getProcessSizeLimit to query the maximum buffer length for
   process and highest supported value for setMaxProcessSize
 * Fix formal test failure in some contexts

- Updated to 3.2.1
 * Fix formal test failure in build configurations using other
   resamplers than the built-in one

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 30 18:37:28 UTC 2023 - Fabio Pesari <fpesari@tuxfamily.org>

- Updated to 3.2.0
 * Fix inability of the R3 engine to produce mono-compatible output
   when processing stereo. In R2 the OptionChannelsTogether option has
   always done this (with some quality caveats). In R3 this option was
   more nearly mono-compatible than the default, but not
   entirely. With this release, OptionChannelsTogether uses a new
   method that is both high quality and mono-compatible and is
   recommended for situations benefiting from this.
 * Correct the start delay calculation in "resample-before" modes of
   both stretcher engines. This affects latency reporting in realtime
   mode when using the non-recommended realtime pitch options
   (i.e. those other than OptionPitchHighConsistency, which is the
   recommended option for variable-rate use in realtime mode)
 * Relatedly, fix failure to use OptionPitchHighConsistency in R3
   LADSPA/LV2 plugins
 * Fix small difference in output from R3 engine depending on whether
   time and pitch ratios were provided on construction or immediately
   after it
 * Expand automated tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 14:45:57 UTC 2022 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Update to 3.1.0
  * Add support for "short window" mode, OptionWindowShort, to
    the new R3 processing engine.
  * Implement OptionPitchHighSpeed in the R3 engine.
  * Add support for the SLEEF library (libsleefdft) for FFTs.
  * Add support for external Speex library (libspeexdsp) for
    resampling.
  * Update the R2 engine so that it always restores vertical phase
    coherence gradually when returning to a ratio of 1.0 (as R3 also
    does) rather than waiting for silence or a transient.
  * Update R3 to properly support all sample rates between 8000 and
    192000 Hz.
  * Update command-line utility so as to use the extension of the
    output filename to determine the file type to write.
  * Remove support for libresample.
  * Fix several bugs, including a crash when run with very low
    sample rates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 17:55:40 UTC 2022 - llyyr <llyyr.public@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.0.0
  * Introduces a new engine
  * Various other changes
- Add rubberband-lv2 package
- Drop obsoleted patch: rubberband-mk.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 10:46:43 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 1.8.2
 * Fix a number of small memory leaks
 * Make stretcher more robust to being fed invalid input (with
   NaNs)
 * Various platform build fixes and improvements
 * The API is unchanged and the library is binary compatible
   with version 1.7.
- Refreshed rubberband-mk.patch
- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 16 14:44:18 UTC 2015 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Cleanup with spec-cleaner
- Remove conditional for < 11.4
- Add baselibs.conf to spec as source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 12 21:43:16 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.8.1
  * Fix a crash in formant-preserving pitch shift for some build targets
- Remove COPYING file from sources; upstreamed
- Remove fix-cstdio.patch; fixed on upstream release
- Use download Url as source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 11:36:18 UTC 2011 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Fix README eol encoding with dos2unix.
- Added rubberband help2man man page generator to spec.
- Downloaded GPLv2 license to replace incorrect COPYING.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 07:33:31 UTC 2011 - mseben@gmail.com

- updated to 1.6
 * Add Smoothing option.  This uses a window-presum FFT, introducing
   time-domain aliasing which is then smoothed using a sinc window.
   This can be used in combination with any of the existing processing
   control options.  This will soften transients but the result may
   still be more pleasant for some material that is not very amenable
   to being time stretched.
 * Fix silent channel of output when processing with band-limited
   transients option
 * Include libresample support
- added fix-cstdio.patch to fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  1 17:35:27 UTC 2011 - toddrme2178@gmail.com
 
- Added 32bit compatibility libraries
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 20 09:13:01 UTC 2010 - mseben@gmail.com

- updated to 1.5
 * Add a more reliable transient detection mode, and make the mode
   selectable using OptionDetectorXXX flags -- the new method is
   the default
 * Band-limit transient detectors to avoid being distracted by
   inaudible garbage
 * Add a key-frame mapping facility for variable stretch ratio
   management during offline stretches
- changes in Rubber Band v1.4 
 * Fix a hang when faced with some very peculiar stretch factors
 * Fix some incorrect threading condition usage
 * Some code rearrangement
 * Fix build on Solaris
- dopped rubberband-gcc44.patch
