Mon Oct  5 16:20:32 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.50.1:
  + SVG2: Support a chain of uri() filters in the "filter"
    property.
  + Support CSS selectors for attribute matching, like
    rect[attr^="prefix"].
  + Fixed the geometry_for_layer() APIs to not ignore the passed
    viewport.
  + Fixed CSS "import" so it allows only files from the same base
    directory.
  + The pkg-config files (*.pc) do not define the 'svgz_supported'
    and 'css_supported' variables anymore.  These variables were
    hardcoded to 'true' and unchanged since 2011.
  + The source repository no longer produces a
    librsvg-uninstalled.pc file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 12:39:48 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.50.0:
  + Librsvg now consumes much less memory for large SVG files.
  + The 'font' shorthand in is now supported in CSS. Librsvg
    ignores the 'line-height' sub-property because it cannot be
    done easily with Pango, but everything else in 'font' should
    work now.
  + Many new features from SVG2:
    - radialGradient now supports the "fr" property from SVG2.
    - Support href attribute in addition to xlink:href per SVG2.
    - Ignore missing filter references per SVG2.
    - Support the mix-blend-mode property from SVG2 and the
      Compositing and Blending Level 1 specification, so layers can
      be composited with operators like multiply/screen/color-burn.
    - Support the paint-order property from SVG2, so one can pick
      the order in which a path's fill/stroke/markers are drawn.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  8 12:15:06 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.48.0:
  + The following is a summary of changes between 2.46.x and
    2.48.0. For full details, please see the 2.47.x release notes
    below.
  + This release requires at least Rust 1.39.
  + New API, rsvg_handle_set_stylesheet(), to set a CSS stylesheet
    independent of the SVG document.
  + Support opacity in patterns.
  + Librsvg's XML parser now supports namespaces (xmlns), and is
    stricter than before about it. Files may fail to parse if there
    are attributes or elements with namespace prefixes (e.g.
    foo:bar instead of plain bar), but without a corresponding
    namespace declaration (e.g.
    xmlns:foo="http://example.com/foo").
    This may happen especially with incorrectly-written SVGs that
    use xlink:href or xi:include attributes without the
    corresponding namespace declarations. If you run into this,
    just add the following to your toplevel SVG element:
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
	   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
           ^^^^^^^^^ these ones
   + Librsvg no longer depends on libcroco, and now does all CSS
     processing using Rust crates from Mozilla Servo. As a result,
     librsvg can now handle much more complex CSS selectors than
     before.

  + Link-time optimization (LTO) is disabled by default on release
    builds, as this increased build time too much. Downstream
    distributors may want to turn it back on in the toplevel
    Cargo.toml.
  + (CVE-2019-20446) - Librsvg now has limits on the number of
    loaded XML elements, and the number of referenced elements
    within an SVG document. This is to mitigate malicious SVGs
    which try to consume all memory, and those which try to consume
    an exponential amount of CPU time.
  + Many bugfixes; please see the 2.47.x release notes below.
- Changes from version 2.47.4:
  + Fix rsvg-convert's multipage PDF output when the zoom option is
    used.
  + Do not stop rendering if an <image> element references a
    nonexistent file. This fixes a number of Open Clipart cases.
  + Compute the font-size cascade correctly when there are "em"
    #and "ex" units involved.
  + Updated the man page for rsvg-convert.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 13 00:20:43 CET 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.47.3:
  + New API, rsvg_handle_set_stylesheet(), to set a CSS
    stylesheet independent of the SVG document.
  + Support opacity in patterns.
  + Move away from the Cairo transform type to our own.
  + Update the gtk-rs version.
- Changes from version 2.47.2:
  + Handling of the "result", "in", "in2" attributes in filter
    primitives is slightly stricter now, and spec compliant.
  + Fix infinite loop when processing CSS sibling combinators.
  + feImage filters no longer clip their output to integer
    coordinates.
  + Documentation for the Rust crate.
  + Debug logs from RSVG_LOG=1 should now be more legible and
    contain better information on invalid CSS.
  + Remove link-time workarounds for Rust pre-1.35.
  + Unify internal error types to share the CSS code with
    gnome-shell.
  + Made handling of XML namespaces more spec-compliant.
  + Lots of refactoring to start moving away from Cairo internals.
- Changes from version 2.47.1:
  + Librsvg no longer depends on libcroco!  It now does all CSS
    processing using Rust crates from Mozilla Servo; these are also
    the crates that are in use in recent versions of Firefox.  As a
    result, librsvg can now handle much more complex CSS selectors
    than before.
- Drop pkgconfig(libcroco-0.6) BuildRequires: no longer needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 25 10:22:54 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.46.4:
  + Panic when reading an invalid stylesheet URL in an XML
    processing instruction.
  + Consider specificity when applying CSS selector matches.
  + Provide an usage example in the librsvg crate docs.
- Drop patches fixed upstream:
  + 0001-croco.rs-Add-struct-definition-for-CRSimpleSel.patch
  + 0002-Compute-the-specificity-of-CSS-selectors.patch
  + 0003-525-Consider-specificity-when-applying-CSS-selector-.patch

- Remove BuildRequires rust-std. The replacement rust-std-static
  is already required by rust.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 23 14:46:43 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.46.3:
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#516: Fix inadvertent bump in the minimum
    Rust version required. The string_cache crate is now pinned to
    a version that still works on Rust 1.34.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#521: Compute geometries correctly if there
    is a viewBox attribute.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#308: Fix stack exhaustion with circular
    references in <use> elements.
  + Consistently use the LGPL 2.1 wherever it is mentioned.
- Drop COPYING, everything is covered by COPYING.LIB now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 17:06:58 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.46.2:
  + Patterns and gradients reused across more than one element will
    only get resolved once now; this should make things marginally
    faster for patterns or gradients with fallbacks.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#515: Librsvg now has limits on the number of
    loaded XML elements, and the number of referenced elements
    within an SVG document. This is to mitigate malicious SVGs
    which try to consume all memory, and those which try to consume
    an exponential amount of CPU time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  7 16:57:23 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.46.1:
  + Fix empty patterns which reference a fallback pattern with
    children.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 19:36:58 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.46.0:
  + All of librsvg.so is now implemented in Rust! That is, except
    for a very thin wrapper over the public API functions.
    Hopefully we can remove this wrapper when Cargo gets some more
    features around controlling the linking step. This release
    requires at least Rust 1.34.
  + Librsvg now comes with a Rust crate that can be used from Rust
    applications. See librsvg_crate/examples. This Rust API is
    designed to be idiomatic; if you want a Rust binding to the
    shared library instead, please use the "rsvg-rs" crate from
    crates.io.
  + The following API functions are new in the C library:
    - rsvg_handle_get_intrinsic_dimensions()
    - rsvg_handle_render_document()
    - rsvg_handle_render_layer()
    - rsvg_handle_render_element()
    - rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_layer()
    - rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_element()
    - Correspondingly, there is a new chapter in the documentation,
      called "Recommendations for Applications". These new APIs
      conform better with the web platform's idea of how SVG
      sizing/positioning should work. Applications should now find
      it easier to scale and render SVGs in a single call, instead
      of having to obtain image dimensions first.
  + A bunch of functions have been deprecated but are still
    available:
    - rsvg_handle_write()/close() are deprecated in favor of the
      stream functions. Unfortunately the write()/close() pair
      require buffering the entire document, in case it is a .svgz
      compressed file; the streaming functions do not have this
      problem.
    - Functions that return RsvgDimensionData and RsvgPositionData
      are deprecated, since they just use integers instead of
      floating point numbers. They are replaced with the
      _get_geometry_*() functions above.
  + The library is a lot more strict now in terms of detecting that
    the API functions are called in the correct order. For example,
    calling rsvg_handle_get_dimensions() before rsvg_handle_close()
    will now emit a critical warning.
  + Librsvg is gradually moving towards using code from Mozilla's
    Servo. We haven't quite gotten rid of libcroco and libxml2 yet,
    but this is in progress.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:12 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.45.92:
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#496: Ensure all lengths and angles parse
    as finite numbers.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#497: Don't panic on paths with
    all-invalid commands.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#500: Added additional SVG blend-modes
    for the feBlend filter primitive.
  + Some changes in the build structure to allow for faster builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:11 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.45.90:
  + New API functions:
    - rsvg_handle_render_document().
    - rsvg_handle_render_layer().
    - rsvg_handle_render_element().
    - rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_layer().
    - rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_element().
  + CairoRenderer in the librsvg_crate has corresponding functions
    as well.
  + Fix builds with gettext ≥ 0.20.
  + If the C API is called out of order, downgrade hard panics to
    g_critical() to cope with incorrect/old applications that
    called rsvg_handle_get_dimensions() before
    rsvg_handle_close().
  + API reference documentation is much improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:10 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.45.8:
  + This version requires at least Rust 1.34.
  + Fix build on Rust earlier than 1.36.
  + Update gtk-rs and dependent crates.
- Changes from version 2.45.7:
  + Don't panic if an SVG has character data outside the first
    element.
  + Don't panic when there's an xi:include fallback with no parent
    element.
  + Fix blurry semi-opaque objects when rendering with a scaled
    transformation.
  + Don't ignore the first x/y/dx/dy in text/tspan elements if
    there is more than one position specified.
  + In librsvg_crate, SvgHandle now has a ::has_element_with_id()
    method.
  + rsvg-convert now catches the case where the SVG has no
    dimensions.
  + This version no longer contains the rsvg-view program, so
    librsvg no longer depends on GTK.
  + The poly element no longer supports "verts" as an alias for the
    "points" attribute. The "verts" name was only used in SVG
    pre-1.0, and we had been cargo-culting that name ever since.
  + We now use more machinery from Mozilla Servo, in this case the
    markup5ever and rust-selectors crates. This is in line with
    gradually replacing libcroco with a Rust-only CSS machinery.
  + Lots and lots of refactoring and cleanups: use the rctree crate
    instead of our own tree representation; remove interior
    mutability in element structs; make the gradients and patterns
    code less repetitive.
  + Update some dependencies.
  + Fix static linking and Windows builds.
- Drop rsvg-view subpackage and pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires
  and obsolete it from main library following upstream changes.
- Add new rsvg-convert subpackage for the convert tool previously
  packaged in rsvg-view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:09 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.45.6:
  + Librsvg now requires Rust 1.30.0 or later.
  + Librsvg now requires Cairo 1.16.0 or later.
  + This version introduces librsvg_crate, an idiomatic Rust crate
    for using librsvg from Rust programs directly, without using
    GObject machinery. This API is subject to change, but you can
    start using it now in an experimental fashion.
  + All of the librsvg internals are now in Rust! The C code is
    just a thin wrapper over Rust functions.
  + The internals library has been converted to Rust 2018.
  + Within librsvg_crate, there is a new infrastructure for doing
    reftests in Rust, that does not depend on PNG reference files.
    See librsvg_crate/tests for details.
  + This release introduces the following new APIs:
    - rsvg_handle_get_intrinsic_dimensions(),
    - rsvg_handle_get_geometry_for_element().
  + Parsing of the "style" attribute, which has a plain list of CSS
    property declarations, is now done with rust-cssparser.
  + CSS selector matching should be marginally faster than before.
  + Fix Visual Studio builds.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#11: Respect the "direction" property for
    bidirectional text.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#295: Ensure the initial viewport fits
    into temporary surfaces for compositing.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#425: Don't fail parsing if the system's
    locale is broken.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#438, glgo#GNOME/librsvg#443: Don't
    create intermediate raster surfaces unless absolutely needed.
    This was causing blurred output for SVGs from Inkscape and
    Illustrator, since they include an "enable-background" property
    even when there are no filters in use.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#443: Fix blurry output when
    enable-background is used without filters.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#455: Fix rounding error on i386.
  + Check for Cairo errors when constructing paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:08 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.45.5:
  + At build time, you can now pass $CARGO and $RUSTC environment
    variables if you need to override the default Rust toolchain.
    Please see COMPILING.md for details.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#405: In the gdk-pixbuf loader, don't
    crash if the write() function doesn't receive a GError.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#268: Remove the comp-op property; it's
    not in SVG 1.1 nor SVG 2.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#415: register RsvgHandleFlags and the
    RsvgError enum values in a thread-safe fashion.
  + All of the library's non-GObject functionality is implemented
    in Rust now.
  + Update the cairo crate.
  + Clean up the loading code paths.
  + Updated compilation docs for Debian.
  + Updated parts of the reference documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:07 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.45.4:
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#402: Fix the library's soname.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 21:56:06 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.45.3:
  + Big news! All the real work in the library is now implemented
    in Rust. The public API is implemented in C, but most it calls
    immediately into the Rust code.
  + rsvg_handle_set_base_uri() now really assumes that it is passed
    a URI. Previously it would try to differentiate between real
    URIs, and absolute or relative file paths. If this breaks your
    code (i.e. you are passing a filename, not a URI), please tell
    us so we can restore the old behavior!
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#395: Don't panic in feMorphology if it
    ends up with a negative scaling transformation.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#398: Detect circular references in
    gradients.
  + Match the Firefox/Chrome behavior on gradients and patterns
    with circular references for fallbacks.
  + Fixes for Rust 1.30 and below.
  + Lots and lots of refactoring.
- Changes from version 2.45.2:
  + rsvg_cleaup() is now deprecated. This was only meant to be
    called from code to be checked by Valgrind. Leak checkers may
    show reachable memory from libxml2; real memory leaks should
    still be reported, of course.
  + As an experimental change, librsvg no longer calls
    xmlInitParser() from libxml2. Please tell us if this causes
    problems for multithreaded programs.
  + Added g_warning()s to ensure the API is called in the correct
    sequence.
  + The text handling code has been completely refactored and
    simplified. This will allow us to implement the x/y/dx/dy
    properties for multiple glyphs in the future. Please report any
    problems you experience in text rendering.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#385: Don't crash if there is no
    rsvg_handle_write() before rsvg_handle_close().
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#391: Avoid undefined behavior when
    casting opaque pointers.
  + Fix crash when a linear RGB filter is followed by an SRGB
    filter.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#393: Stack overflow when freeing
    thousands of sibling elements.
  + Fix positioning of adjacent <tspan> elements.
  + All the toplevel loading and drawing code is implemented in
    Rust now.
  + Pixbuf conversion code is in Rust now.
  + Cleanups in the code for XML processing, markers, attributes.
  + Many build/link fixes.
  + Cleanups in the code that calls libxml2.
- Changes from version 2.45.1:
  + New public API, rsvg_handle_get_geometry_sub(), to get the
    exact geometry of an element. The functions
    rsvg_handle_get_position_sub() and
    rsvg_handle_get_dimensions_sub() are deprecated now; these
    returned incomplete data with integer coordinates.
  + rsvg_handle_write() and rsvg_handle_close() are now deprecated
    in favor of the functions which use a GInputStream. The former
    need to buffer the entire SVG data first; the latter don't need
    buffering.
  + Librsvg no longer tries to load XML entities which reference
    external resources, either parameter or general entities,
    declared in the DTD. This never worked properly, and it is
    better to do so via the xi:include mechanism. Also, unparsed
    external entities with a notation are not really supported in
    SVG; it has its own <image> element and similar for that
    purpose. Only internal general entities are supported now, for
    example:
    - <!ENTITY foo "<some xml here>">.
    - <!ENTITY bar "some text here">.
  + Started support for localized error messages.
  + Ported to Rust: loading code, XML processing code, data: URL
    parsing.
  + Many code cleanups and refactorings.
  + Fix undefined behavior in casts.
  + Cairo/Rust API updates.
  + configure.ac cleanups.
- Add lang_package macro/subpackage, librsvg now have translations.
- Add a librsvg_sover define and set it to 2.

    Rust 1.28.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#497: Don't panic on paths with
    all-invalid commands.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#496: Ensure all lengths and angles parse
    as finite numbers.

    This was causing blurred output for SVGs from Inkscape and
    Illustrator, since they include an "enable-background" property
    even when there are no filters in use.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#443: Fix blurry output when
    enable-background is used without filters.
  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#455: Fix rounding error on i386.
  + Check for Cairo errors when constructing paths.

  + Fix glgo#GNOME/librsvg#323: Don't use 100% "forever" with
    malicious SVGs that cause an exponential number of elements to
    be instanced through the <use> element. We limit the number of
    <use> instances now.

    as the SVG 1.1 test suite; this is relevant for
    stroke-dasharray.
  + Refactoring of the drawing code and font sizes.
  + New filters in Rust: feConvolveMatrix, feColorMatrix,
    feMorphology, feDisplacementMap, feGaussianBlur,
    feDistantLight, feSpotLight, fePointLight, feTile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 23 07:35:30 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.43.0:
  + Fixes:
    - feDistantLight and feSpotLight now work again
      (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#241).
    - feComposite is fixed not to overwrite the source image in
      some cases; this fixes drop shadows generated from Inkscape
      (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#282).
  + Rust implementation:
    - Text, tspan and tref elements;
    - Basic styling infrastructure;
    - Internals of the drawing infrastructure and bounding-box
      computation;
    - Element creation from the parsing stage;

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 23 07:35:28 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.42.7:
  + Fix a denial-of-service condition from exponential explosion of
    rendered elements, through nested use of SVG "use" elements in
    malicious SVGs. This is similar to the XML "billion laughs
    attack" but for SVG instancing (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#323).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 23:00:18 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

    (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#241).
  + Don't panic if we try to clip with an empty region
    (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#292).
  + Fix out-of-tree builds and tests.
  + Compilation can now use a RUST_TARGET variable to override the
    host triplet when cross-compiling. See COMPILING.md for
    details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  2 15:05:50 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.42.5:
  + Don't render filter primitives that have invalid attributes.
    This was causing a crash in feColorMatrix
    (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#266).
  + rsvg_handle_render_cairo() will now refuse to render if the
    cairo_t passed to it is in an error state. Fixes a panic in the
    cairo-dock program (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#276).
  + The test suite now writes test artifacts to tests/output
    instead of /tmp (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#206).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  7 22:47:07 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.42.4:
  + Fixes:
    - Elements with systemLanguage attributes without variants now
      work better.
    - Possible crash on invalid gradient references.
    - Negative values are catched in stroke-dasharray properties
      instead of leaving the cairo_t in an error state
      (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#227).
    - Empty transform attribute now correctly yields an identity
      transform (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#228).
  + Make robust against patterns and gradients with no children.
  + Lots of code cleanups and refactorings.
  + Code moved to Rust: low-level path and PangoLayout drawing,
    "switch" element.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  5 18:13:07 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.42.3:
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#205: The configure script now checks for
    Rust 1.20.0. Previously this minimum requirement was not
    well-defined.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#204: New feature: If an SVG has an <a> link
    element, we now generate the corresponding link when
    outputting to a Cairo PDF surface.  If you use rsvg-convert(1)
    with PDF output, <a> links in the SVG will work in the PDF.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#108: New feature: support font-size:larger
    and font-size:smaller relative sizes.
  + New feature: rsvg-convert now supports SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to
    generate reproducible output for PDFs.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#197: New requirement: We now require
    Freetype2 2.9.0, which fixes font rendering bugs. The test
    reference PNGs have been regenerated with this version.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#91: Fix rendering of masks and clips when
    the initial transformation has a translation component.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#112: Fix: apply style attributes for all SVG
    elements, not just for the toplevel one.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#161: Fix the marker angle for the last
    vertex of closed paths.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#198: Fix: Make rsvg_pixbuf_from_file() and
    its derived functions work again.  Now we have tests for the
    whole public API.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#143: Minor optimizations for Gaussian blurs.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#201: Minor speedups in the code to parse SVG
    attributes.
  + glgo#GNOME/librsvg#178: Fix some tests that failed on 32-bit
    machines.
  + In addtion to --enable-debug/--disable-debug to control the
    Rust compilation, now you can use an environment variable
    LIBRSVG_DEBUG=yes / LIBRSVG_DEBUG=no if you wish.
  + Code moved to Rust: SVG paint servers, SVG attribute parsing.
  + We now use a Cargo workspace internally, to move more things to
    Rust.
- Add pkgconfig(freetype2) BuildRequires: New dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Update rust-cssparser to 0.23.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 23 21:41:14 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.42.1:
  + Parse the transform attribute in a faster/simpler way. We now
    use rust-cssparser instead of lalrpop.  This is especially
    noticeable on SVGs with lots of "transform" attributes
    (glgo#librsvg#182).
  + Don't crash when setting a gradient on a zero-sized object
    (glgo#librsvg#187).
  + Inherit attributes in the <svg> element properly
    (glgo#librsvg#181).
  + rsvg-convert - fix error reporting when reading from stdin
    (glgo#librsvg#160).
  + Fix detection of image type in "data:" URIs when they don't
    specify a MIME type (glgo#librsvg#152).
  + More stringent parsing of path data; better tests
    (glgo#librsvg#133).
  + Fix typos and links in the .md files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  9 22:43:13 UTC 2018 - zaitor@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 27 20:55:24 UTC 2017 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 2.41.2:
  + Bug fixes:
    - Mis-use of libxml2 (bgo#787895).
    - Allow masks and clips to reuse a node being drawn
      (bgo#761175).
  + Fixes:
    - xml:space normalization, per the spec.
    - Bugs from Coverity runs.
    - Loading files one byte at a time.
    - Some memory leaks.
  + Don't access the file system when deciding whether to load a
    remote file with a UNC path for a paint server (i.e. don't try
    to load it at all).
  + Add:
    - Support for cross-compilation of the Rust code.
    - Verbosity to Cargo.
  + Markers now have the correct default size per the SVG spec.
  + Don't render elements that establish a viewport if their
    viewBox size is 0, per the spec.
  + SVG elements ported to Rust: image, clipPath, mask, character
    data in elements.
  + Reference documentation now have an overview of the library and
    is DocBook 5.1.
  + Expanded the test suite.
  + Lots of internal refactoring.
- Changes from version 2.41.0:
  + The big news is that parts of librsvg are now implemented in
    the Rust programming language, instead of C. The public API
    remains identical. Rust should provide us with memory safety
    and nicer built-in abstractions for the code, as well as an
    easier way to do unit tests.
  + Added an "--enable-debug" option to configure.ac - this will
    tell the Rust compiler to generate debugging code, instead of
    working in release mode. Note that you must still pass CFLAGS
    by hand by the regular means for the C code.
  + The path data parser now handles boolean values in Arc elements
    correctly.
  + Radial gradients now adjust the focus point correctly to be
    within the gradient's radius.
  + Stroke width normalization is now conformant to the spec.
  + Viewport-relative length normalization is now conformant to the
    spec.
  + Added some of the official SVG 1.1 test files to our test
    suite. Fixed a little bunch of conformance bugs.
  + Code that has been converted to Rust:  marker orientations and
    rendering, path data parser, path building, length
    normalization, gradient inheritance, bounding boxes with affine
    transformations.
  + Added tests/README.md with instructions on how to run the test
    suite and update it.
  + rsvg-test can now skip files or directories that start with
    "ignore".
  + Fixes:
    - feImage filters when they reference SVG nodes.
    - eComponentTransferFunction when there are duplicated feFuncX.
      elements.
    - Conformance bugs in gradient inheritance.
    - A few minor issues.
  + Fixed bugs: bgo#763386, bgo#603550, bgo#776297, bgo#761871,
    bgo#686953.
- Changes from version 2.41.1:
  + The feConvolveMatrix filter primitive now is working.
  + Pattern specifications can now have a fallback color, per the
    spec - https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#SpecifyingPaint
  + Tests now use a very basic form of reproducible font rendering.
    This means that "make check" should pass even if you have a
    custom Fontconfig setup.
    - A few cases of uninitialized struct fields.
  + Per the spec, we now don't render elements which have invalid
    attributes.
  + Don't crash in filters when one of them yields an invalid
    surface for an intermediate result.
  + Added a bunch of new test cases for the new features and the
    code converted to Rust.
  + cairo-rs 0.2.0 and lalrpop 0.13.1 are now required.
  + Fixes:
    - Recursive fallbacks in gradients.
    - Division by zero in feTile filter when the input surface is
      empty.
    - parsing of "azimuth", "elevation", "limitingConeAngle" for
      filter effects.
  + Fixed bugs: bgo#621088, bgo#587721, bgo#776932, bgo#777155,
    bgo#776297, bgo#777834, bgo#634324, bgo#783835, bgo#779489,
    bgo#782098, bgo#777833, bgo#786372, bgo#634514, bgo#785276,
    bgo#778666.
- Update Url to https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg: current
  LibRsvg project's web page.
- Add BuildRequires for the following new dependencies that
  upstream's rust implementation brought: cargo, rust and rust-std.
- Add pkgconfig(cairo-png) BuildRequires: it was already being
  pulled with pkgconfig(cairo) and used, since they live in the
  same devel package.
- Add gio-unix-2.0 and gthread-2.0 pkgconfig BuildRequires: they
  were already being pulled with pkgconfig(glib-2.0) and used,
  since they all live in glib2-devel package.
- Adopt the use of %make_build rather than raw make command and
  switch %makeinstall by the preferred %make_install macros,
  following the best practices.
- Remove obsoleted %clean section since RPM does this job now and
  replace old macro for number of jobs control with %make_build
  following best practices.
- Change rsvg-thumbnailer subpackage group to
  Productivity/Graphics/Other as this is a better fit for it.
- Export -Wl,-z,noexecstack LDFLAG to avoid executable-stack
  issues. It's only a temporary flag until upstream give feedback
  (glgo#GNOME/librsvg#177).

  + Fix other cases of division-by-zero on fuzzed SVG files.
  + Don't crash on invalid transformation matrices.
  + Support Visual Studio 2017; generate .pc files for Meson on
    Windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 10 07:06:52 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.17:
  + bgo#778666: Use our own thumbnailer specification file, so
    gnome-desktop-thumbnailer can generate thumbnails outside of
    the calling process.
  + Removed some redundant code.
  + Windows build fixes.
- Split out new sub-package rsvg-thumbnailer (noarch).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  9 08:47:24 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.16:
  + Support for building the introspection files under MSVC.
  + Make the zooming options in rsvg-convert(1) work again for
    scaling the resulting image (bgo#760262).
  + Wikipedia generates equations as SVGs and renders them, but
    uses fill="currentColor". Since we don't let caller specify a
    starting state for CSS, we need to start with opaque black as
    the default current color (bgo#764808).
  + Added documentation for how to replace the deprecated
    rsvg_handle_set_size_callback().
- Drop librsvg-Fix-rsvg-convert.patch: Fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 18 11:18:56 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add librsvg-Fix-rsvg-convert.patch: Actually scale the image if
  required, regression fix from upstream git (bgo#760262).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 15 21:47:01 UTC 2016 - mgorse@suse.com

- Update to GNOME 3.20  Fate#318572

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  2 09:58:17 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.15:
  + Librsvg now uses the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct,
    version 1.4, to which all contributors and maintainers are
    expected to abide. Please see the code_of_conduct.md file for
    details.
  + Fixed builds on Visual Studio pre-2012.
  + Fixed bgo#759084: Don't crash when filters don't actually
    exist.
  + Updated our autogen.sh to use modern autotools.
  + Fixed bgo#761728: Memory leak in the PrimitiveComponentTransfer
    filter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 19:20:06 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.13:
  + Fixed the Windows build.
  + Added basic support for the "baseline-shift" attribute in text
    objects (bgo#340047).
  + Fixed some duplicate logic when rendering paths (bgo#749415).
  + Rewrote the markers engine (bgo#685906, bgo#760180).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 09:54:39 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.12:
  + Refactoring of the test harness to use Glib's gtest
    infrastructure, instead of using home-grown machinery.  Tests
    can simply be put as SVG files in the tests/subdirectories; it
    is not necessary to list them explicitly in some text file.
  + Gzipped SVGs now work if read from streams.
  + References to objects/filters/URIs/etc. are now handled lazily.
    Also, there is a general-purpose cycle detector so malformed
    SVGs don't cause infinite loops.
  + Removed parsing of Adobe blend modes; they were not
    implemented, anyway.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#700911, bgo#630732, bgo#677068.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 07:25:58 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.11:
  + Add project files for building on Visual Studio (bgo#753555).
  + Added an "--export-id" option to rsvg-convert(1). This lets you
    select a single object to export, for example, to pick out a
    group from a multi-part drawing.  Note that this is mostly
    useful for PNG output right now; for SVG output we don't
    preserve many attributes which could be useful in the extracted
    version.  Doing this properly requires an internal "output to
    SVG" backend instead of just telling Cairo to render to SVG.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  9 10:43:43 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.10:
  + bgo#748608: Memory leak when Gaussian-blurring.
  + bgo#739329: Font-family attributes with singly-quoted names
    were not handled correctly, yielding incorrect fonts.
  + bgo#476507: Path start/end markers didn't have the correct
    angle if the path was a curve with coincident control points.
  + bgo#688689: Support font-style="normal" within a non-normal
    styled text block.
  + Fixed builddir != srcdir.
  + Remove a bunch of deprecated GTK+ calls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 15 10:46:09 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Remove reference to gtk2-engine-svg from baselibs.conf: this
  subpackage hasn't been built since Oct 22 2013.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 27 09:22:06 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.9:
  + bgo#738367: V/v/H/h commands in path elements were not working.
  + bgo#605875: Gaussian-blurred objects were sometimes missing.
  + bgo#710163: Use _wfullpath() on Windows when canonicalizing
    filenames.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 27 17:37:38 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.8 (boo#916784):
  + Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: bgo#744688 - possible double
    g_free() when processing stroke-dasharray.
  + Optimize rendering of polylines, lines, rectangles, circles,
    and ellipses.  These should be marginally faster, marginally
    more precise, and should put less pressure on the memory
    allocator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 16 15:41:43 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.40.7:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 14 15:51:00 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.39.0:
  + Don't load resources from the net (bgo#691708, CVE-2013-1881).
- The restrictiveness is being correctly addressed by GTK+ 3.9.11;
  we prefer to have the more secure librsvg variant in 13.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 21 11:52:14 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Downgrade to version 2.37.0:
  + We can not use librsvg version 2.39.0 as it is too restrictive
    (bgo#706428).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 16 14:19:21 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.39.0:
  + Don't load resources from the net (bgo#691708, CVE-2013-1881).

- Update to version 2.36.0:
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#669563, bgo#672414, bgo#672792, bgo#672725.
- Drop librsvg-gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-64.patch: fixed upstream,
  by checking for both gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-64 and
  gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.
- Remove automake BuildRequires: it was only needed for above
  patch.
- Remove hack in %install to not install data files for an old
  non-working GTK+ 3 theme: fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 25 10:23:05 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Remove librsvg:/usr/bin/rsvg Provides from rsvg-view: the
  /usr/bin/rsvg tool doesn't exist anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 11:09:51 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Really build introspection support:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 11:17:28 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.35.2:
  + Bug fixes.
- Remove xz BuildRequires now that it comes for free in the build
  system.
- Add gobject-introspection-devel BuildRequires to build
  introspection support: somehow, we never did that earlier.
- Drop env-paths.diff: the script that was patched got dropped.

  engine got removed.
- Remove build_gtk3_support macro and always build with GTK+ 3
  support now that it's all fine.

  + Bugs fixed: bgo#664684, bgo#665905, bgo#665824.
  + Several misc. code changes.
- Add xz BuildRequires because we can't build a package for a
  xz-compressed tarball without explicitly specifying that... See
  bnc#697467 for more details.
- Add explicit pkgconfig(pangocairo) BuildRequires: it was missing
  before.
- Fix license of subpackages: all the code is LGPL-2.0+, except
  some tests that are not shipped in subpackages. The overall

  + Bugs fixed: bgo#629392, bgo#626802, bgo#641586, bgo#640336,
    bgo#635214, fdo#30071, bgo#629412, bgo#630714.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 15 11:36:38 CET 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.32.1:
  + fdo#30071: Make sure the surfaces own their pixels
  + bgo#630714: Remove stray comma from enum
  + bgo#629412: Dist testcase input file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 11 21:24:08 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add a Provides for librsvg to librsvg-2-2 in baselibs.conf, like
  in the .spec file.
- Add missing Requires for gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders to
  gdk-pixbuf-loader-rsvg in baselibs.conf.
- Add gtk2-engine-svg to baselibs.conf, since we want theme engines
  to be bi-arch too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  4 11:54:03 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Fix librsvg-2-2 Provides/Obsoletes to work: they were using
  %{name} instead of %{version} for the version. Fix bnc#642068.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 27 08:16:51 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.32.0:
  + Disable gtk3 build since it's currently broken.
- Drop librsvg-gdk-pixbuf-render-gtk3.patch and
  librsvg-gdkkeysym-compat.patch: those patches are only needed for
  gtk3 support, and the gtk3 support will be enabled upstream when
  they will get fixed.
- Add build_gtk3_support define in .spec, to easily add back the
  gtk3 support to the package. Right now, this means we lose the
  gtk3-engine-svg subpackage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 18 17:12:53 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add librsvg-gdkkeysym-compat.patch to fix build with recent
  versions of GTK+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 10 00:06:06 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Add librsvg-gdk-pixbuf-render-gtk3.patch to fix build with
  GTK+ 3: the pixbuf renderer was using API that got removed. The
  patch is correct, but suboptimal, so it's still sitting in
  bugzilla. However, since we're not using this GTK+ engine by
  default, it's okay to use it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 23 09:26:51 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Make devel package Require librsvg-2-2 instead of librsvg.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

                file
  + bgo#614556: Background pixbuf in filter process should not be
                created if it's not needed.
  + bgo#616018: cairo-freetype font rendering code should be
                removed.
  + bgo#620130: Decode base64 inplace
  + bgo#620238: crashes rending a trivial file
  + bgo#620592: Use correct free func
  + bgo#620649: Simplify code by using g_clear_error
  + bgo#620693: presentation attributes in svg element are ignored

  + bgo#621699: make librsvg gio friendly
  + bgo#622790: use standalone gdk-pixbuf
  + bgo#623383: crash on rsvg-gobject.c:141, in instance_dispose
                function
- Add librsvg-gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-64.patch to fix the build on
  x86_64, since gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders is renamed to
  gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders-64 there.
- Remove coreutils PreReq.
- Change gtk2-devel, libcroco-devel, libgsf-devel BuildRequires to
  pkgconfig() BuildRequires: cairo, fontconfig, freetype2,
  gdk-pixbuf-2.0, glib-2.0, gio-2.0, gtk+-2.0, libcroco-0.6,
  libgsf-1, libxml-2.0, pangoft2.
- Add pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires.
- Remove the cairo-devel, libcroco-devel, glib2-devel, gtk2-devel,
  libgsf-devel Requires in devel package: pkgconfig() Requires will
  automatically get added now.
- Version the Provides/Obsoletes of librsvg2 and librsvg2-devel in
  librsvg-2-2 and librsvg-devel to avoid rpmlint warning.
- Split the gdk-pixbuf loader in a gdk-pixbuf-loader-rsvg
  subpackage (that gets installed automatically when gdk-pixbuf is
  installed thanks to a Supplements).
- Create a librsvg-2-2 subpackage that provides/obsoletes librsvg
  (since the main package is empty), and follow the shared library
  policy.
- Create gtk2-engine-svg and gtk3-engine-svg subpackages,
  containing the svg-based theme engines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
