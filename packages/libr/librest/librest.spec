%description
This library was designed to make it easier to access web services that
claim to be "RESTful". A reasonable description is that a RESTful
service should have urls that represent remote objects, which methods
can then be called on.

It is comprised of two parts:

    * the first aims to make it easier to make requests by providing a
      wrapper around libsoup.
    * the second aids with XML parsing by wrapping libxml2.
