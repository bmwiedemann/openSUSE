  <title>Fuse libretro core for ZX Spectrum emulation</title>
  <description>Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) was originally, and somewhat unsurprisingly,
a ZX Spectrum emulator for Unix. However, it has now also been ported to Mac OS X,
which may or may not count as a Unix variant depending on your advocacy position.
It has also been ported to Windows, the Wii, AmigaOS and MorphOS, which are definitely
not Unix variants. This package is for RetroArch/Libretro front-end.</description>
