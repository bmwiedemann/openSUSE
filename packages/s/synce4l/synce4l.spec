%description
synce4l is a software implementation of Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) according to ITU-T Recommendation G.8264. The design goal is to provide logic to supported hardware by processing Ethernet Synchronization Messaging Channel (ESMC) and control Ethernet Equipment Clock (EEC) on Network Card Interface (NIC).

Application can operate in two mutually exclusive input modes: line or external. Both modes are described in next paragraphs.

The best source selection is done according to ITU-T Recommendations G.781 and G.8264. Two network options are supported: option 1 and option 2.
