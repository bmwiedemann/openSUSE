Fri Oct  9 19:51:19 UTC 2020 - Bruce Rogers <brogers@suse.com>

- Note: The Mar 9, 2020 spec file cleanup and the following change
  satisfy jsc#SLE-15520
- Remove gstreamer-plugins-libav and gstreamer-plugins-good as
  BuildRequires. Even though the configure step of the package
  build does report detection of features from these packages, the
  build is actually not otherwise influenced by the presence of
  these packages. It is at runtime when these plugin packages are
  utilized, so leave the Recommends for these in the package spec,
  so that if the packages are available in a distro they can get
  installed and utilized.

Wed Sep 19 19:42:07 UTC 2018 - Bruce Rogers <brogers@suse.com>

- Update to v0.14.1 stable release
  The announcement email describes this release as follows:
  The main change in this release is the addition of a new protocol
  extension in order to support streaming the remote display as a
  video stream rather than going through the QXL protocol. Together
  with spice-streaming-agent, and/or with more work on the qemu/
  spice-server side, this should allow streaming of 3D accelerated
  VMs in the future. At this point, this part of spice-server is
  still a work in progress (multi-monitor support and various
  features are missing).
  * avoid performance issues on Windows 10 KVM guests (boo#1109044)
  * add new org.spice-space.stream.0 channel used for passing an
    encoded video stream from the guest to the client
  * add support for TCP_CORK to reduce the amount of packets that
    we send
  * fix CVE-2018-10873 (maintainer note: we already carried fix)
  * fix cursor related migration crash
  * fix regression causing sound recording to be muted after client
    disconnection/reconnection (introduced in 0.13.90)
  * fix regression in corner cases where images could be sent
    uncompressed when they used to be compressed with QUIC
  * disable TLS 1.0 support
  * CELT 0.5.1 support is now disabled by default. If celt051-devel
    is installed at build-time, --enable-celt051/--disable-celt051
     must be explicitly specified
  * drop support for unsupported OpenSSL version. OpenSSL 1.0.0 or
    newer is now required
  * bumped minimum required glib version to 2.32
  * endianness fixes
  * (small) leak fixes
  * usual round of code cleanups
  * not directly related to this release, but the upstream git
    repository is now hosted on gitlab.freedesktop.org

- Install documentation and license file
- Add configure arguments to most of the options to not rely on
  autotools automatic behavior
  * Also enable gstreamer and lz4 options

  when building from git snapshot

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 07:25:59 UTC 2017 - cbosdonnat@suse.com

- Release 0.14.0
  * fix client mouse with virgl
  * fix frozen display after seamless migration
  * set human-readable name on spice threads
  * add sanity-checks for ORC library as it can abort spice-server
    when selinux is in use
  * Close TCP connection early when client did not send the correct
    SPICE magic bytes: this allows VNC clients to gracefully fail
    when connecting to a SPICE port
  * Add VP9 encoding support when GStreamer is being used and misc
    streaming/encoding improvements
  * Improvements to replay utility
  * Limit (deprecated/unusud) QXLMessage size to 100,000 characters
    for improved safety

    GStreamer backend
  * Added GStreamer support to the video streaming code

    unconditionally sending keepalive probes every 10 minutes
  * Added public spice_server_set_keepalive_timeout() to make it possible
    to tweak keepalive on all SPICE connection. This can prevent unwanted
    idle disconnections if proxies are used between the client and the host.
  * Fix important memory usage when the webdav channel is used
  * Do not disconnect when the client requests an unsupported compression type
  * Fix potential race condition when using multiple QXL devices
  * Fix display glitch when using XSpice
