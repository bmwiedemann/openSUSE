-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 19 19:42:07 UTC 2018 - Bruce Rogers <brogers@suse.com>

- Update to v0.14.1 stable release
  The announcement email describes this release as follows:
  The main change in this release is the addition of a new protocol
  extension in order to support streaming the remote display as a
  video stream rather than going through the QXL protocol. Together
  with spice-streaming-agent, and/or with more work on the qemu/
  spice-server side, this should allow streaming of 3D accelerated
  VMs in the future. At this point, this part of spice-server is
  still a work in progress (multi-monitor support and various
  features are missing).
  * avoid performance issues on Windows 10 KVM guests (boo#1109044)
  * add new org.spice-space.stream.0 channel used for passing an
    encoded video stream from the guest to the client
  * add support for TCP_CORK to reduce the amount of packets that
    we send
  * fix CVE-2018-10873 (maintainer note: we already carried fix)
  * fix cursor related migration crash
  * fix regression causing sound recording to be muted after client
    disconnection/reconnection (introduced in 0.13.90)
  * fix regression in corner cases where images could be sent
    uncompressed when they used to be compressed with QUIC
  * disable TLS 1.0 support
  * CELT 0.5.1 support is now disabled by default. If celt051-devel
    is installed at build-time, --enable-celt051/--disable-celt051
     must be explicitly specified
  * drop support for unsupported OpenSSL version. OpenSSL 1.0.0 or
    newer is now required
  * bumped minimum required glib version to 2.32
  * endianness fixes
  * (small) leak fixes
  * usual round of code cleanups
  * not directly related to this release, but the upstream git
    repository is now hosted on gitlab.freedesktop.org

  override

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 18 12:12:33 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

  * Condition it using name everywhere instead of suse versions
    and join together with lz4
- Format with spec-cleaner
- Convert dependencies to pkgconfig style
- Install documentation and license file
- Add configure arguments to most of the options to not rely on
  autotools automatic behavior
  * Also enable gstreamer and lz4 options
- Drop the not needed python dependencies, they are needed only
  when building from git snapshot

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 26 07:25:59 UTC 2017 - cbosdonnat@suse.com

- Release 0.14.0
  * fix client mouse with virgl
  * fix frozen display after seamless migration
  * set human-readable name on spice threads
  * add sanity-checks for ORC library as it can abort spice-server
    when selinux is in use
  * Close TCP connection early when client did not send the correct
    SPICE magic bytes: this allows VNC clients to gracefully fail
    when connecting to a SPICE port
  * Add VP9 encoding support when GStreamer is being used and misc
    streaming/encoding improvements
  * Improvements to replay utility
  * Limit (deprecated/unusud) QXLMessage size to 100,000 characters
    for improved safety
  * Improve image quality in low bitrate situation when using the
    GStreamer backend
  * Added GStreamer support to the video streaming code
  * Fix old migration bug causing migration to never end in some cases
  * Added lz4 compression to the spicevmc channel
  * Ongoing code cleanups
  * add spice_qxl_gl_scanout() spice_qxl_gl_draw_async() for local
    virgl support
  * spice_server_set_keepalive_timeout() has been removed in favour of
    unconditionally sending keepalive probes every 10 minutes
  * Added public spice_server_set_keepalive_timeout() to make it possible
    to tweak keepalive on all SPICE connection. This can prevent unwanted
    idle disconnections if proxies are used between the client and the host.
  * Fix important memory usage when the webdav channel is used
  * Do not disconnect when the client requests an unsupported compression type
  * Fix potential race condition when using multiple QXL devices
  * Fix display glitch when using XSpice
  * Improve help string for 'replay -s'
