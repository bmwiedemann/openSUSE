%description
This package provides a command line tool for connecting a
client system to the SUSE Customer Center. It will connect the system to your
product subscriptions and enable the product repositories/services locally.
suseconnect-ng reduces the size of its runtime dependencies compared to the
replaced SUSEConnect.

Empowering you with enriched system visibility in the SUSE Customer Center

SUSE is committed to helping provide better insights into the consumption of
SUSE subscriptions regardless of where they are running; physical or virtual,
on-prem or in the cloud.

SUSE has been working on several improvements to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC),
RMT, and SUSE Manager to provide a clearer picture of your system landscape:

- SUSE Manager v4.1+ now sends system information to SCC.
- SCC now captures which products are activated on systems that sit behind RMT
  or SMT.
- This update will enable your system to "ping" SCC/RMT daily to
  confirm the system's active status. This will help you identify or filter out
  systems in SCC that are no longer running or decommissioned. As always, the
  choice is yours, you can disable the daily ping by disabling the
  suseconnect-keepalive systemd timer.

We will continue improving our products to make it easier for you to view and
manage your subscription consumption. As always, we'd love to hear your feedback
about these improvements and any ideas you might have.
