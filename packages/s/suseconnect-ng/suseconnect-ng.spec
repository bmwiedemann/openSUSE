%description
This package provides a command line tool for connecting a
client system to the SUSE Customer Center. It will connect the system to your
product subscriptions and enable the product repositories/services locally.
suseconnect-ng reduces the size of its runtime dependencies compared to the
replaced SUSEConnect.
