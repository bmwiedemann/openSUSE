  <title>A collection of tools that send SCSI commands to devices</title>
  <description>The sg3_utils package contains utilities that send SCSI commands to
devices. As well as devices on transports traditionally associated with
SCSI (e.g. Fibre Channel (FCP), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and the SCSI
Parallel Interface(SPI)) many other devices use SCSI command sets.
ATAPI cd/dvd drives and SATA disks that connect via a translation layer
or a bridge device are examples of devices that use SCSI command sets.</description>
