  <title>Natural layout for Swing panels</title>
  <description>Swing Layout Extensions goal is to make it easy to create
   professional cross platform layouts with Swing. This project has
   an eye towards the needs of GUI builders, such as NetBeans. This
   project consists of the following pieces: * Ability to get the
   baseline for components.

* Ability to get the preferred gap between components.

A new LayoutManager that utilizes both of these concepts and is tuned
toward a free-form drag and drop layout model as can be provided by GUI
builders.</description>
