Sun Nov  2 13:00:56 UTC 2025 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Pull in kernel-devel and enable xe-drm.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 27 14:45:28 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.0:
  * Add new API to discover discrete GPUs; works with amdgpu,
    nouveau, i915, xe, and the proprietary NVIDIA driver.
  * Include environment variable VK_LOADER_DRIVERS_SELECT for
    selecting the approriate Vulkan driver.
  * Add Xe and AMDGPU drivers to the Vulkan driver list.
- Build with discrete-gpu check for Intel Xe disabled because
  meson cannot find `drm/xe_drm.h`, which for openSUSE kernels is
  in `/usr/src/linux-<VER>/include/uapi/`. Meson fails at
  configure unless this is disabled.
- Drop unnecessary rpmlintrc file since man file has been
  installed for a while now and rpmlint does not complain about
  'missing man file'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 13:38:29 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  PatchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  4 00:01:24 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.6:
  * Remove the recently added support for setting the GPU for
    Vulkan apps as this broke sandboxed Vulkan apps. 
  * Fix for non-x86 platforms not having a default GPU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  1 17:31:06 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.5:
  * Add support for setting the GPU to use for Vulkan apps, on
    systems with heterogenous GPUs.
  * Fix "--gpu" option not working as documented.
  * Install the D-Bus configuration file in the correct location.
- Adapt dbus conf file location in keeping with upstream (requires
  re-evaluation by security team bsc#1199065).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 10:11:24 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Added patch(es):
  * harden_switcheroo-control.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  5 14:22:48 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.4:
  * Fix the cleaned-up name of some video cards not being picked
    up.
  * Add a test suite.
- BuildRequires: pkgconfig(umockdev), python-dbus-python, and
  python-rpm-macros for unit test run as part of %check.
- meson >= 0.50 is required; update BuildRequires accordingly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 15:00:36 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.3:
  * Fix the path to the interpreter for the switcherooctl tool
    added in 2.2.
- Changes from version 2.2:
  * Port build system to meson.
  * Add a command-line utility to launch specific commands on a
    specific GPU, or the first discrete one.
- Adapt to meson build system; drop autoconf, automake from
  BuildRequires and add meson.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  4 13:29:46 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.1:
  * Fix the wrong data type being advertised in the introspection
    XML for the GPUs property, which lead to incorrect
    auto-generated code
  * Fix a potential assertion on startup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 19:16:20 UTC 2019 - Dingzhong Chen <wsxy162@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.0
  + This release adds a number of new properties to list GPUs,
    figure out how to launch OpenGL client on specific GPUs, and
    figure out which one is the default, in a way that supports the
    stock GPU drivers as well as the NVidia proprietary drivers.
  + The service file itself also makes use of systemd's hardening
    features.
  + Note that the API was extended in a backwards compatible way.
- Change the repo URL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 09:19:39 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.3.1
  + Fix Secure Boot work-around to not misdetect any system as
    being dual-GPU and error out when it wasn't
- Changes from version 1.3:
  + Work-around lack of access to vga_switcheroo when booting with
    SecureBoot enabled
  + Work-around a possible kernel deadlock on boot
  + Install binary in $libexecdir

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 20 23:23:27 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Add systemd-rpm-macros BuildRequires and service_add_*
  pre/post/preun/postun scriptlets for switcheroo-control.service
  to comply with openSUSE's Guidelines (boo#1096823).
- Pass --with-systemdsystemunitdir=%{_unitdir} parameter to
  configure to correct the systemd unit file's location.
- Adopt the use of %make_install macro rather than raw make
  command, following the best practices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 22 16:54:09 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.2:
  + Fix API documentation not being part of the tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 23 16:21:05 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Change License tag to GPL-3.0 instead of GPL-3.0+ (see legal
  review for https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/507370).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 25 11:10:34 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- DBus service has been reviewed and approved (boo#1034309),
  remove corresponding entry from rpmlintrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 15 00:09:16 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Initial package.
- Add %{name}-rpmlintrc file to filter out warning about missing
  man file for binary (upstream does not provide it) and set
  badness for 'suse-dbus-unauthorized-service' to zero until
  security review approves the dbus service (see boo#1034309).
