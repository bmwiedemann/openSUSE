  <title>Query for a selection from the user and print the region to stdout</title>
  <description>slop (Select Operation) queries for a selection from the user and prints
the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it into a crosshair,
lets the user click and drag to make a selection (or click on a window)
while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints the selection's
dimensions to stdout.</description>
