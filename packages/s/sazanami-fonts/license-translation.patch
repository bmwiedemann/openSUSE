+font and refined manually with a font editor.

+in May and June 2003, the 18 dot gothic version has been created from
+1st of July 2003 until 10th of February 2004. Since then,
+tuning and refinement continues.
+
+   
+  We express our gratitute to Mr. Kano, the author of the Kappa font
+which has been used as the base, to Mr. Furukawa who created the
+non-Kanji outlines of the Kochi-subst font and to all others
+who helped with this software.

+About the ORADANO Mincho font Ver. 0.2003.1026
+
+October 26th, 2003.
+Akira? UCHIDA (内田明)
+<uchida@happy.email.ne.jp>
+
+
+- What is the ORADANO Mincho font?
+
+The ORADANO Mincho font is a font being created by Mr. Uchida aiming
+to cover all non-kanji from JIS X 0213:2000 and most of the kanji.
+
+The outlines for the Kana glyphs and the related symbols in this font
+are created by Mr. Uchida based on the "size five" typeface which was
+used for printing and sold by the Toukyou-Tsukiji printing factory
+during the years 30-31 of the Meiji era [1].  The other non-kanji
+glyphs are an original design by Mr. Uchida.
+
+The outlines for the kanji glyphs in this font have been drawn by
+Mr. Uchida while consulting the glyphs from the general sample
+catalogue of "size five" mincho type face glyphs published in the year
+2 of the Taishou era (1912 - 1926) by the Toukyou-Tsujiki printing
+factory which are recorded in the "Mincho type face character style
+table" of the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs.
+
+- usage of the ORADANO Mincho font
+
+Everybody can use this font free of charge for printing, display,
+embedding into electronic texts and similar purposes.  This font may
+be distributed and redistributed freely without having to pay any
+royalties. This font may also be bundled with other software which is
+sold. This font may also be used to develop new fonts.
