- Update to version 7.000
  * There is no longer a "Compact" variant; line spacing should be
    applied by the editing/publishing software instead.
  * There are no ‘pre-tuned’ regional or "Literacy" special-purpose
    modified variants anymore.
  * Support added for complex positioning of bridging double
    diacritics and nearby marks.

- update to 6.200:
  * This release is focused on adding features and 240+ glyphs,
    including support for over 180 additional characters mostly
    from Unicode 14 and 15. It does not include significant changes
    to line spacing, glyph widths, or kerning that might cause
    document reflow or layout changes—except for minor improvements
    to the size and weight of superscript, subscript, and modifier
    letters.

  * The font now supports SIL TypeTuner

  * Serbian and Macedonian alternates are also available through
    a new OpenType feature (cv84) for applications that do not support
    language-specific locl features

  * Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000. These have now been removed to
    reflect current best practice font development guidance.
