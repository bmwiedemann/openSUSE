  <title>Doulos SIL fonts similar to Times</title>
  <description>Doulos SIL provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic
characters. Doulos's design is similar to the design of the Times-like
fonts, but only has a single regular face. It is intended for use alongside
other Times-like fonts where a range of styles (italic, bold) are not
needed.
