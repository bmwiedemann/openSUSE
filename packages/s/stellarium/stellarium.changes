  + Recoded time methods based on Qt time function 
    (this fixed bug #1740595, LANG=en_IN crash).
  + Use the new Grid class by Guillaume Chéreau for NebulaMgr.
  + Made StelUI and StelCommandMgr real StelModules.
  + Increased grid labeling brightness.
  + Fixed splash screen flickering and logo image truncation in 
    full screen mode.
  + Fixed wrong nebula size (bug #1673142)
  + Fixed constellation art intensity bug (bug #1733482)
  + Got rid of all wstreamstring and therefore don't require 
    STLPort anymore for MinGW compilation.
  + Added more command line options.
  + Re-coded StelAppQt4 init and deinit to prevent GLContext errors.
  + New config parameters for controlling star brigthness, 
    size, color

    on error) and #1758435 (segfault)
