- update to version 0.2.4, official 0.2.4 changelog:
Most important changes since 0.2.3:
- Some parts of the Python API have been marked as deprecated and generate warnings when used. This
  may be a bit unusual for a bugfix release; on the other hand, they won't be removed any time soon
  and inserting the deprecation warnings now will give everyone as much time as possible for getting
  accustomed to the API we're moving towards.
  Most prominently,
    Table.cell(column,row) and
        Table.setCell(column,row,value)
  are deprecated in favour of
    Table.column(column - 1).valueAt(row - 1) and
    Table.column(column - 1).setValueAt(row - 1, value)
  (note that the column/row INDICES DIFFER BY ONE!); the same goes for
    Table.text(c,r) -> Table.column(c - 1).textAt(r - 1) and
    Table.setText(c,r,text) -> Table.column(c - 1).setTextAt(r - 1,text).
  This serves multiple purposes. It simplifies the interfaces by grouping all functionality specific
  to a certain column in the Column class; it allows column objects to be stored and passed around;
  and it moves from the unconventional 1-based indexing to the more conventional 0-based indexing.
  Future additions to the API will increasingly make use of the columns-as-objects paradigm.
- lots of bugfixes, again including crashes
- fixed compatibility issues with Qt 4.6 and SIP 4.9
- performance improvements
- substantially improved support for plots involving date/time data
- added two Czech translations: a default one by Pavel Fric (feedback requested via
  http://fripohled.blogspot.com) and an alternative one by Jan Helebrant
- updated Spanish translation, thanks to Mauricio Troviano; Brazilian Portuguese translation, thanks
  to Fellyp do Nascimento; and German translation
- fixed and extended many parts of the API for Python scripts, including the new methods
    Layer.pickPoint()
        MDIWindow.clone()
        Folder.save(filename)
        newGraph(string)
        Layer.printDialog()
        Graph.printDialog()
        Layer.setRightTitle(string)
        Layer.setTopTitle(string)
        Layer.grid() # => returns an instance of the new class Grid
        Layer.insertFunctionCurve(formula,from=0,to=1,points=100,title="")
        Layer.insertPolarCurve(radial_formula,angular_formula,from=0,to=2*pi,parameter="t",points=100,title="")
        Layer.insertParametricCurve(x_formal,y_formula,from=0,to=1,parameter="t",points=100,title="")
        Matrix.recalculate()
  the constants QwtPlot.yLeft, QwtPlot.yRight, QwtPlot.xBottom, 
  QwtPlot.xTop for specifying axes and the Grid class
- multiple graphs can have active tools simultaneously
- based on user feedback, the default behaviour when importing ASCII 
  files has been changed to interpret the data as numeric (only applies 
  to fresh installations of SciDAVis)
- automatic resizing of table rows for multi-line cells intentionally 
  dropped, because this seems to be rarely needed and has a huge impact 
  on performance for large tables
For older changes, see the CHANGES file in the documentation.

Thu Mar 26 00:00:00 UTC 2009 - Leon Freitag <leon@links2linux.de>

- update to version 0.2.1, official 0.2.1 changelog:
This is the first bugfix release in the 0.2 series. Most importantly, 
saving project files containing fit/function curves works again. 
Other fixes include:
 - fixed opening of backup copy on discovery of a corrupt project file 
 - Spanish translation update by Mauricio Troviano 
 - fixed several regressions introduced by the table/matrix rewrites in 0.2.0 
 - added per mille and per ten thousand signs to SymbolDialog 
 - compatibility problems between SIP versions triggers a warning instead 
   of a crash (happens sometimes when SIP version at runtime differs from 
   the one  used at compile time) 
Changes from 0.1.4 to 0.2.0:
Most important changes (since 0.1.4) 
 - multi-level undo/redo for all operations on tables and matrices 
 - many operations on tables and matrices now support non-contiguous selections 
 - the important options/controls for matrices and tables are now integrated in a sidebar 
 of control tabs which make working with column or matrix based data much more 
 convenient (almost no more opening and closing of dialogs necessary) 
 - tables now support different formulas for each cell 
 - numeric values are now stored independent of their textual representation, 
   i.e., you don't lose data when hiding decimal digits 
 - formula edit mode: tables feature a new mode which allows the user to 
   individually edit the formula for each cell  
 - invalid cells: tables now mark cells without input as invalid rather 
   than treating them as 0; these cells are ignored in plots 
 - date/time values are now internally stored as QDateTime objects which 
   opens up many new possibilities of date/time manipulation using 
   PyQt/Python scripting 
 - many bug fixes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 4 00:00:00 UTC 2008 - Leon Freitag <leon@links2linux.de>

- moved the manual to /usr/share/doc/packages/scidavis-manual

 - executing script code now gives a visual feedback 
 - new Windows installer 
 - many improvements to make compilation and Linux packaging easier 
 - fixed graph duplication
