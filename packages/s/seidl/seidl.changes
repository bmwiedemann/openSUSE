- Packaging improvements:
  * _service change disabled to manual per osc deprecation warning:
    WARNING: Command 'disabledrun/dr' is obsolete, please convert
    your _service to use 'manual' and then 'manualrun/mr' instead.
  * _service change tar and recompress from buildtime to manual
  * _service obs_scm param revision use git tag
  * _service obs_scm param versionformat use @PARENT_TAG@
  * _service set_version move earlier in service ordering
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.18 matching go.mod
  * Drop BuildRequires: fdupes and usage during install step. Go
    application packages have a small number of installed files and
    this hasn't been an issue following the transition from GOPATH
    (where sources were installed) to Go modules where only
    binaries and supporting files e.g. doc, license are installed.
  * Use %%name macro where applicable to normalize common lines
    across Go app packages. Also makes renaming binary easier when
    required to handle package name conflict.
