  <title>SSH server auditing</title>
  <description>Utility to test the performance of interactive ssh sessions or scp file
transfers. It uses ssh to log into a remote system, then runs two tests: the
first test sends one character at a time, waiting for each character to be
returned while it records the latency time for each. The second test sends a
dummy file over scp to /dev/null on the remote system.
