- Update to 1.18
  * Added USELIBPCRE to make use of regex engine optional.
  * Added support for RFC4366 SNI and RFC7301 ALPN
    (Travis Burtrum)
  * Changed connection log to include the name of the probe that
    triggered.
  * Changed configuration file format: 'probe' field is
    no longer required, 'name' field can now contain
    'tls' or 'regex', with corresponding options (see
    example.cfg)
  * Added 'log_level' option to each protocol, which
    allows to turn off generation of log at each
    connection.
  * Added 'keepalive' option.
  Version 1.17
  * Support RFC5952-style IPv6 addresses, e.g. [::]:443.
  * Transparant proxy support for FreeBSD  (Ruben van Staveren)

    /etc/sslh/sslh.cfg and then /etc/sslh.cfg as configuration files.
    (argument to -F can no longer be separated from the option by a space,
    e.g. must be -Ffoo.cfg)
  * Call setgroups() before setgid() (fixes potential
    privilege escalation) (Lars Vogdt)
  * Use portable way of getting modified time for OSX support (Aaron
    Madlon-Kay)
  * Example configuration for fail2ban (Every Mouw)
- Dropped missing-call-to-setgroups-before-setuid.patch, included
  upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 18 09:31:58 UTC 2014 - jsegitz@novell.com

- Added filepath-in-systemd-service.patch to point to correct
  patch in systemd service file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 25 19:05:13 UTC 2014 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.16:
  + Probes made more resilient, to incoming data
    containing NULLs. Also made them behave properly
    when receiving too short packets to probe on the
    first incoming packet.
    (Ondrej Kuzník)
  + Libcap support: Keep only CAP_NET_ADMIN if started
    as root with transparent proxying and dropping
    priviledges (enable USELIBCAP in Makefile). This
    avoids having to mess with filesystem capabilities.
    (Sebastian Schmidt/yath)
  + Fixed bugs related to getpeername that would cause
    sslh to quit erroneously (getpeername can return
    actual errors if connections are dropped before
    getting to getpeername).
  + Set IP_FREEDBIND if available to bind to addresses
    that don't yet exist.
- compile with libcap support
- added missing-call-to-setgroups-before-setuid.patch
- removed patches fixed upstream:
  + sslh-asprintf.patch
  + sslh-chroot.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 22 14:50:15 UTC 2013 - rob.verduijn@gmail.com

- added /etc/conf.d/sslh
  now the service actually starts when using systemd 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 11 19:20:54 UTC 2013 - rob.verduijn@gmail.com

- update to 1.15:
  + Added --transparent option for transparent proxying. See README for iptables magic and capability management.
  + Fixed bug in sslh-select: if number of opened file descriptor became bigger than FD_SETSIZE, bad things would happen.
  + Fixed bug in sslh-select: if socket dropped while defered_data was present, sslh-select would crash.
  + Increased FD_SETSIZE for Cygwin, as the default 64 is too low for even moderate load.
    Thanks to Arnaud Gendre and Michael K. Avanessian for helping with investigation of the last three points.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 17:36:22 UTC 2013 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.14:
  + Corrected OpenVPN probe to support pre-shared secret
    mode (OpenVPN port-sharing code is... wrong). Thanks
    to Kai Ellinger for help in investigating and
    testing.
  + Added an actual TLS/SSL probe.
  + Added configurable --on-timeout protocol
    specification.
  + Added a --anyprot protocol probe (equivalent to what
    --ssl was).
  + Makefile respects the user's compiler and CFLAG
    choices (falling back to the current values if
    undefined), as well as LDFLAGS.
    (Michael Palimaka)
  + Added "After" and "KillMode" to systemd.sslh.service
    (Thomas Weißschuh).
- use upstream sslh.systemd.service instead of own one

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 23 19:41:44 UTC 2012 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.13b:
  + WARNING: Options changed, you'll need to update your start-up 
    scripts! Log format changed, you'll need to update log 
    processing scripts
  + Added support for configuration file.
  + New protocol probes can be defined using regular expressions that 
    match the first packet sent by the client.
  + Added HTTP probe.
  + Now supports IPv6 throughout (both on listening and forwarding)
  + Logs now contain IPv6 addresses, local forwarding address, and 
    resolved names (unless --numeric is specified).
  + Introduced long options.
  + Bind to multiple addresses with multiple -p options.
  + Added -o "OpenVPN" and OpenVPN probing and support.
  + Added -f "foreground" option.
- adapted init script to new options
- added option for openVPN target address in sysconfig file
For openSUSE > 12.1:
- added config file /etc/default/sslh - but this needs to be enabled/
  added in SSLH_OPTS="" in /etc/sysconfig/sslh for now as the 
  sysconfig file already contains all variables
- added systemd file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
