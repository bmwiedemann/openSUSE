- Updated to 1.10 version. For more details see NEWS file

  * bugfixes in tabs / SawfishConfig and more
  * tiling. Thanks to the awesome work done by Jose A. Ortega Ruiz
    Sawfish is now a stacking / tiling hybrid. The NEWS contains
    example configuration.
  * sawfish.wm.prg: integration of external applications into Sawfish
    / SawfishConfig (trayer, xmobar, xmodmap, xsettingsd, xgamma,
    fehlstart, pancake), see docs/AUTOSTART for more information
    about them.
  * compton integration. Thanks to fuchurs mind-reading
    capatibilities the compton compositing manager now neatly
    integrates with Sawfish /SawfishConfig, allowing you to 
    change most options for compton directly from SawfishConfig. 

- Spec file changes

Wed May 15 20:29:20 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 1.9.91
 * Bug Fixes
   - Always rebuild the list of marked windows in tabs when closing
     a marked window.  [fuchur]

   - Updated 'ru' and 'pt_BR' translations via transifex.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  8 15:23:04 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.9.90
   * Updated or New dependencies
        - PangoX: no longer required

   * Bug Fixes
        - Always rebuild the list of marked winows in tabs when closing
          a marked window. [fuchur]

        - Only allow a window to be tabbed, if the parent window's
          framestyle has support for tabs.  (Note that in Sawfish
          different windows can have diffrent framestyles) [fuchur]

        - `window-ops-menu' was still calling
          `resize-window-to-dimension' that didn't exist anymore since
          Sawfish 1.7. Use `resize-window-prompt' instead. [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Make "Sawfish Rootmenu" label an insensitive menu-item, so
          that clicking it while the root-menu pops-up doesn't make the
          menu dissapear immediately. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - In SawfishConfig you can select different cursor shapes for
          different buttons. Some of the definitions have been wrong
          and could crash Sawfish when choosing them. This is fixed
          now. [fuchur]

        - When a windows `max-width' or `max-height' would exceed 32767
          (X11's maximum) it would result in odd window-behaviour (for
          example: no maximization button), this is fixed by capping
          the value at 32767. Originally reported with Firefox and
          Thunderbird 17.0 [Michael Panteleit]

        - Fixed grabbing key-bindings in SawfishConfig. [Christopher
          Bratusek]

   * New Features
        - Tiling. [Jose A. Ortega Ruiz] [Christopher Bratusek]
          Currently this module is under heavy testing (so you have
          been warned!). `tall-tile' has been tested to properly work
          (with some minor hickups), while `col-tile' is untested.
          Example on how to test the new `tall-tile' module (for more
          infos read `lisp/sawfish/wm/tile/readme.org':

               ;; Tiling
               (require 'sawfish.wm.tile.tile)
               (tall-tiling 0 #:width 2 #:top 0 #:bottom 1 #:gap 1 #:max 3)
               (bind-keys global-keymap
                          "F11" 'tile-workspace
               	   "C-S-KP_Add" 'increase-max-windows
               	   "C-S-KP_Subtract" 'decrease-max-windows
               	   "C-F11" 'next-tiling)

        - Completeley revised `resize-window-prompt'. Now display
          window's name and old width (respectively old height) when
          prompt for new values. Shows an information, if one of the
          given values is not actually a number. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - External Application modules. Those modules allow handling,
          setting-up external application during a sawfish session. See
          `AUTOSTART' for additional notes on them.
             ++ `trayer' module. Handles a `trayer' (a system-tray)
               instance during a sawfish session.  [Christopher
               Bratusek]

             ++ `xmobar' module. Handles a `xmobar' (an on-screen, very
               flexible bar, monitoring whatever you like) instance
               during a sawfish session. [Christopher Bratusek]

             ++ `xmodmap' module. Allows reading `~/.Xmodmap' on
               startup of Sawfish. [Christopher Bratusek]

             ++ `xsettingsd' module. Handles a `xsettingsd' (a daemon
               implementing XSettings to provide GTK+ application with
               information like what theme to use))instance during a
               sawfish session. [Christopher Bratusek]

             ++ `xgamma' module. Allows changing display's gamma
               settings on startup of Sawfish. [Christopher Bratusek]

             ++ `fehlstart' module. Handles a `fehlstart' (a simple,
               but yet flexible application launcher) instance during a
               sawfish session. [Christopher Bratusek]

             ++ `pancake' module. Handles a `pancake' (a simple desktop
               panel with pager, window-list, taskbar, tray) instance
               during a sawfish session [Christopher Bratusek]

   * Miscellaneous Changes
        - Updated `Elberg-tabbed' and `gradient-tabbed' for tab-system
          as of Sawfish 1.9.1 [fuchur]

        - Wallpaper setter now has an option for setting wallpaper on
          startup. Image widget is now more robust.  [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Improved default keymap for `titlebar' and `tabbar'. [fuchur]

        - Revived `decorate-transients', `menus-include-shortcuts' and
          `customize-show-symbols' defcustoms.  These options are now
          adjustable from `sawfish-config' again. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Give the `root-window' the property `'WINDOW_MANAGER' on
          startup with value `sawfish'.  [Christopher Bratusek]

    window's size [Robert Zenz]
  * When destroying a window marked for tabbing, before
    tabbing  was done, tabbing didn't work anymore until Sawfish
    restarted. This is fixed now. [fuchur]
  * In `Makedefs.in' source `$(repexecdir)/rules.mk' as
    first, so that `--prefix' and co. from `configure' won't get
    overwritten. [Allin Cottrell]
  * In `tabs' some minor issues have been fixed, like correct
    `raise' or `sticky' tabs, and some issue with `move-resize'
    tabs. [fuchur]

      default the keybinding is `C-Button2-Off'. [fuchur]
    + Tabs now support `viewport-sticky' and
      `workspace-sticky'.  [fuchur]
    + Tabs now support coloring the window-title in a different
      color, for windows, which are marked for tabbing.Currently

  * Miscellaneous Changes
    + In razor-qt integration module add `About Razor-Qt' help

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  2 16:13:01 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.9.0 For a full list of changes since 1.8.2 see NEWS

   * Bug Fixes
        + When cursor-warping was enabled and user switched to a shaded
          window, the cursor warped to the position of the unshaded
          window. This is fixed now.  [Christopher Bratusek]

        + When switching between tabbed themes from SawfishConfig, it
          could happens that there were `gaps' in the frame. This is
          fixed now. [Christopher Bratusek]

        + In SawfishConfig one could only grab key-bindings, but not
          mouse- or mixed mouse-key-bindings. This is fixed now. (Move
          mouse 20 pixels to grab a `Move' event).  [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        + SawfishConfig became useless when Sawfish restarted. This is
          now worked-around by simply restarting SawfishConfig when
          Sawfish does. A new `before-restart-hook' has been added for
          this purpose. [Christopher Bratusek]

        + In EdgeActions `HotSpot', `HotMove' and `EdgeFlip', it was
          possible to trigger the same event multiple times at a time.
          This is fixed now.  [Jeremy Hankins]

        + Fixed a bug in apps-menu, failing to generate the menu, if a
          desktop-file contains both Categories and the (errorneous)
          Category key, or only the later. [Matthew Love]

        + Fixed a bug in window-manager selection handling. Set all
          fields of the client message event. This prevents bugs, where
          Sawfish sometimes isn't able to replace another
          window-manager or aquiring the screen if no other WM is
          running. [Timo Korvola]

        + When making X request, we might receive and `select' will
          stuck. This is fixed now [Michal Maruska]

        + Avoid calling Xmap for gone windows. [Michal Maruska]

        + Fixed a possible segmentation fault in `leave_notify' [Michal
          Maruska]

        + In SawfishConfig the `choice' widget didn't work when the
          choices were numerical values. This is fixed now.
          [Christopher Bratusek]

  * spec cleanup

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  + User visible changes:
    - Fully renamed from "sawmill" to "sawfish"
