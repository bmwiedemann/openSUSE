  <title>Lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs</title>
  <description>THIS PACKAGE IS WIP AND BEING PREPARED FOR FACTORY.

Suil is a lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs.

Suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using any other toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by Suil). Hosts do not need to build against or link to foreign toolkit libraries to use UIs written with that toolkit (Suil performs its magic at runtime using dynamically loaded modules). The API is designed such that hosts do not need to explicitly support particular toolkits whatsoever.

If Suil supports a particular toolkit, then all hosts that use Suil will support that toolkit.</description>
