Summary:        Fallback implementation for SIMD intrinsics

%description devel
The SIMDe header-only library provides portable implementations of SIMD
intrinsics on hardware which do not natively support them, such as calling
SSE functions on ARM. There is no performance penalty if the hardware supports
the native implementation (e.g. SSE/AVX runs at full speed on x86, NEON on
ARM, etc.).
