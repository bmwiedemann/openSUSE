-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 29 15:24:43 UTC 2026 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 0.56.1
  Bug fix:
  * Clipboard: Fix compilation failure
  version 0.56.0:
  New Features:
  * Add Append action to add subtitles from another files with
    their timecodes as-is.
  * Add keyframe command line switch and automatically open
    keyframes (and open keyframes automatically when they share
    filename with other files)
  * Implement BorderStyle=4 for ASS subtitles (libass only) to
    show rectangular box even for two- and more-line subtitles.
  * Add AutoWrap action that wraps subtitles into lines that are
    shorter than Maximum Characters per Line
  User Interface Improvements:
  * Make mpv show window when playing audio files
  * Sort keyboard shortcuts alphabetically and show dynamic ones
    first
  * Add modern format like MP4 to autoopen
  * Simplify Move plugin: use current position as new time,
    provide better feedback on nonsensical user input and by
    default move all subsequent subtitles when only one subtitle
    is selected
  * Changing playback speed now does not distort sound (pitch)
  * Join Subtitles now by default offsets the new subtitles by
    the length of the video, but the offset can also be set by
    the user
  * When creating a new file from clipboard or when importing
    from plaintext, add an extension
  * Use em-dash instead of a hyphen in user facing strings
  * Force ratio option is now better explained
  * For empty files, set format based on extension (so opening
    empty file.srt no longer throws an error)
  * Use radio buttons to indicate which view is active and also
    make changes to a view apply immediately.
  * GUI: Make lines longer than max char per line bold and red
  * GUI: make it impossible to select uneditable columns (like
    subtitle number)
  * Fix labels and tooltip displayed at the bottom of the window
    when hovering over menu items: now all should have a tooltip,
    and often with more precise wording
  * Import and export are now in File menu, not its submenu
    (they were only items in the submenu previously)
  * Add shortcuts, icons and change order of Clipboard actions
  Bug fixes:
  * Clipboard actions in the menus are now properly faded when
    not applicable
  * Respect layers when reading an ASS file
  * Style editor no longer shows default style twice
  * Make styles editable for new files
  * Remove leading zeroes for margins when reading ASS files (so
    now margin is 0 and not 0000)
  * Handle Unicode BOM properly
  * Fix crash on mouse move and click in empty waveform renderer
    with unsaved non-empty file
  * Stop emitting GTK warnings when using the clipboard plugin
  * Fix typoes
  Development & Modernization:
  * Change default clang formatting and save all files with it,
    hopefulyl making the style more uniform
  * Moved from gstreamermm to gstreamer C API, which should make
    playback a lot more reliable and improbe Wayland support
    (thanks Kitone!)
  * Improve .gitignore
  * Add info on how to make a release to README
  * Remove some obsolete content
  * Fix compilation warnings for ASS subtitles plugin
  * Make Style editor work when running local build
  * Make ti possible to compile with libxml++3.0
  * Sort all accessible bugs from GNA! and either fix them or
    open new issues on GitHub
