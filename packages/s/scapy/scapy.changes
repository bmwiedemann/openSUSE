Tue Nov  5 12:53:13 UTC 2024 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- Update to 2.6.1
  * On linux machines with IPv6 disabled, Scapy would crash on startup 
  * The scapy.1 manpage was no longer installed
  * Upon the first startup, there could be a crash related to the creation of 
    Scapy's XDG-* related folders.
  * other small bugs that could lead to issues during packaging. 
    Thanks to the downstream package maintainers for their help.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 30 12:31:33 UTC 2024 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- Update to 2.6.0
  * support for RFC6874-like scope identifiers. This is very useful for 
    multicast IPs as one can now do the following on L3: 
    sr(IP(dst="224.0.0.1%eth0")/..., multi=True)
  * using the iface= argument is deprecated on level3 functions (send, sr, sr1),
    as its behavior was undefined. It remains in use for level2 
    functions (sendp, srp, srp1). RFC6874-like scope identifiers should be used.
  * the internals that read the routes and interfaces configuration have been
    rewritten on Linux and BSD:
    - on linux, to use RTNETLINK. (this should help on machines that have huge BPG tables)
    - on *BSDs, to use PF_ROUTE.
    - on Linux, NetBSD and FreeBSD, link-local and multicast routes should now properly be loaded
  * new Windows protocols:
    - DCE/RPC: DCERPC_Client and DCERPC_Server with support for NCACN_IP_TCP and NCACN_NP
    - SMB2/3:
      * Protocol refactor, many more SMB2/3 structures supported
      * Server (class + 'simple' util smbserver()) (2.0.2 to 3.1.1)
      * Client (class + interactive CLI smbclient()) (2.0.2 to 3.1.1)
      * SMB socket, RPC over SMB socket, etc.
    - Kerberos:
      * KerberosSSP to use in SMB/RPC clients/servers, [MS-KILE] variants, SFU and more
      * Crypto: use cryptography, latest RFC8009, GSS_WrapEx support, typing, etc.
      * Util functions krb_as_req, krb_tgt_req, kpasswd (both modes), etc.
      * Ticketer++: ccache support, ask/renew/resign/edit tickets, etc
    - NTLM:
      * refactor, clean SSP
    - Extensive GSSAPI / SPNEGO support
    - LDAP 
      * Fixes, ASN.1 Windows variation support
      * dclocator, answering machine for "LDAP PING", etc.
      * add a (very) basic LDAP_client (support for various binding mechanisms, encryption, etc.)
- More features, bug fixes and updated protocol support as listed in:
  https://github.com/secdev/scapy/releases/tag/v2.6.0
