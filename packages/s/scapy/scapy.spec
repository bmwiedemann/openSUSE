%description
Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, packet generator,
network scanner, network discovery tool, and packet sniffer. It provides
classes to interactively create packets or sets of packets, manipulate them,
send them over the wire, sniff other packets from the wire, match answers and
replies, and more. Interaction is provided by the Python interpreter, so Python
programming structures can be used (such as variables, loops, and functions).
Report modules are possible and easy to make. It is intended to do about the
same things as ttlscan, nmap, hping, queso, p0f, xprobe, arping, arp-sk,
arpspoof, firewalk, irpas, tethereal, tcpdump, etc.
