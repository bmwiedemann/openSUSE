- Update to version 1.3
  * Networking
    - Server bookmarks

    - Introduce render resolution scaling for the modern renderer.
      For users with limited GPU power, this allows to get significant performance (FPS) gains
      at the cost of image quality.
      It can also allow additional graphics effects at the same performance.
      This is especially useful for users with high-resolution and high-DPI screens.
      The scaling only affects the 3D scene, the UI remains crisp at full-resolution.
    - Simplification through removal of unused deprecated graphical effects
    - Many updates to texture-related code
    - Auto-compute Level of Detail distances for 3D models set to use LOD depending on track complexity.
