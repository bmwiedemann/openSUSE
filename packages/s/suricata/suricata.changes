- Disable LTO because of build issues when building the Rust
  components.
- Remove htp dependency
- Remove lua dependency
- Enable eBPF support
- Remove old configure flags
- Migrate %setup to %autosetup

- Update to version 8.0.0:
  * Lua breaking changes:
    ~ No ability to load third-party modules in Lua rules
    ~ No access to the “os” Lua library for access to system
      resources such as the file system
    ~ Moving global Lua functions that access Suricata features
      to Lua libraries
  * The general detection engine performance was improved.
  * PCAP reading mode can now process files faster.
  * Suricata initialization has been significantly improved.
  * More protocol conversions to Rust including:
    LibHTP, FTP, ENIP, MIME parsing
  * New protocols: ARP: decoder and logger, DNS over HTTPS (DoH),
    LDAP support, Multicast DNS (mDNS), POP3: decoder and logger,
    SDP: parse traffic over SIP, SIP: parse traffic over TCP,
    Websocket support
  * Data JSON for data sets: enrich alerts using metadata in
    datasets
  * New transforms and keywords: from_base64, entropy, luaxform
  * requires: rules can check for keywords or features
  * Integer keywords: accept hexadecimal notation, negated ranges,
    enumerations, bitmask
  * IPS: Suricata as a Firewall. The firewall mode is considered
    experimental and may be subject to changes during the 8.0
    lifecycle.
  * Lua 5.4 has been “vendored” into the Suricata code base,
    making it always available by default.
  * Lua now runs in a sandboxed environment, so users can allow
    Lua rules with confidence they won’t perform activities such
    as writing to files or opening sockets or other system-level
    access allowed  by an unrestricted Lua runtime.
  * Improvements to output formats
  * Release blog post:
