%description
Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed
especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive
letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.

A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for
teaching people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered
than those of most serif fonts.
