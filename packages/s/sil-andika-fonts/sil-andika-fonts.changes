- Update to 6.200:
  * This release is focused on adding features and 300+ glyphs,
    including support for over 180 additional characters mostly from
    Unicode 14 and 15. It does not include significant changes to
    line spacing, glyph widths, or kerning that might cause document
    reflow or layout changes—except for minor improvements to the
    size and weight of superscript, subscript, and modifier letters
  * Most important changes: support for subscript and superscript
    numerals and automatic fractions
