    <comment>- update to 4.5.0:
  * This release comes packed with a number of exciting new synths
    for you to play with. We have a new hard-hitting kick drum
    :gabberkick for that gabber sound and a new vintage electric
    piano :rhodey synth. There are also 16 new percussive synths
    inspired by the infamous TR-808 drum synthesiser. All the
    synths come with many opts for you to play with to manipulate
    and change the default timbres.
  * see https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/blob/v4.5.0/CHANGELOG.md#v4.5.0
- drop qscintilla-2.14.patch (upstream)

- update to 4.4.0:
  * This release comes chock-full of new samples to play with.
    Firstly we have 5 new samples donated to Sonic Pi by the
    wonderful electric artist Arovane. These are a selection of
    glitchy beats recorded at 130 BPM. To best use these either
    `use_bpm 130` or use the `beat_stretch` opt to make them fit
    seamlessly into your current BPM. They're also wonderful to
    use with the `onset:` option for extracting individual sounds
    to use on their own. Thank-you so much to Arovane for letting
    us play with these amazing new sounds.
  * Continuing on the sample theme, there are also 20 new hi-hat
    samples. These all have a `:hat_` prefix and there's a wide
    variety of sounds to play with ranging from acoustic to
    electro to metal. They're perfect for adding a sense of drive
    or groove to your tracks.
  * This version of Sonic Pi is also the first to support a fully
    native build for Apple Macs running Apple Silicon CPUs such
    as the M1 and M2. This means that Sonic Pi can now run on
    modern Mac computers without needing Rosetta to run things</comment>
