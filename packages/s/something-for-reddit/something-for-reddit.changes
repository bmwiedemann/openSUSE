- Update to version 0.2.2:
  + The frontpage is now visible. You can see it by going to / in
    the url bar.
  + The app now supports Flatpak & NixOS installation
  + Performance improvements in the comments view
  + The codebase is now tested! I'm pretty sure this is one of the
    only GTK+ apps which has proper UI tests - so this should stop
    more regressions in the future!
- Changes from version 0.2.1:
  + Replaced the markdown engine, should now support more features
  + The alignment in subreddit listings should now be more uniform
  + Many size related bugs have been fixed
  + The url bar is now less lenient on formatting. Previously,
    going to /linux would take you to /r/linux. Due to the
    frontpage changes, this no longer happens
  + [PACKAGING] Moved icons from pixmaps to the hicolor directory
  + [PACKAGING] Change SCSS compiler from ruby sass to sassc
- Drop desktop.patch: Fixed upstream.
- Replace ruby(sass) for sassc
- Fix python env to be py3 via sed call
- Modernize spec, drop no longer needed post(un) calls.
