  <title>Simple DirectMedia Layer Glue for C++</title>
  <description>SDLmm aims to stay as close as possible to the C API while taking
advantage of native C++ features like object oriented programming. It
also aims to be as platform independent as possible. In other words, it
tries to support every platform that SDL supports.</description>
