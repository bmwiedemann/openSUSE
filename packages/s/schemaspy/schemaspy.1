.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Java-based tool that analyzes the metadata of a schema in a database
and generates a visual representation of it in a browser-displayable
format. It lets you click through the hierarchy of database tables via
child and parent table relationships as represented by both HTML links
and entity-relationship diagrams. It's also designed to help resolve
the obtuse errors that a database sometimes gives related to failures
due to constraints.
.Pp
.Nm
uses JDBC's database metadata extraction services to gather the majority
of its information, but has to make vendor-specific SQL queries to
gather some information such as the SQL associated with a view and the
details of check constraints. The differences between vendors have been
isolated to configuration files and are extremely limited. Almost all
of the vendor-specific SQL is optional.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Ss Commonly Used Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t Ar databaseType
Type of database (e.g. mysql, ora, db2, etc.).
Use
.Fl dbhelp
for a list of built-in types.
Defaults to
.Ar ora . 
.It Fl db Ar dbName
Name of database to connect to.
This flag is required.
.It Fl u Ar user
Valid database user id with read access.
A user id is required unless
.Fl sso
is specified.
.It Fl s Ar schema
Database schema.
This is optional if it's the same as user or isn't supported by your database.
Use
.Fl noschema
if your database thinks it supports schemas but doesn't (e.g. older versions of Informix).
.It Fl p Ar password
Password associated with that user.
Defaults to no password.
.It Fl o Ar output-dir
Directory to write the generated HTML/graphs to.
This flag is required.
.It Fl dp Ar path-to-drivers
Looks for drivers here before looking in
.Pa driverPath
in
.Pa [databaseType].properties .
The drivers are usually contained in .jar or .zip files and are typically provided by your database vendor.
.It Fl hq
.It Fl lq
Generate either higher or lower-quality diagrams.
Various installations of Graphviz (depending on OS and/or version) will default to generating either higher or lower quality images.
That is, some might not have the "lower quality" libraries and others might not have the "higher quality" libraries.
Higher quality output takes longer to generate and results in significantly larger image files (which take longer to download /
display), but the resultant Entity Relationship diagrams generally look better.
.El
.Ss Less Commonly Used Options
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl gv Ar path-to-graphviz
By default SchemaSpy expects the dot executable to be in the
.Pa PATH
environment variable.
Use this option to explicitly specify where Graphviz is installed.
.It Fl desc Ar description
Displays the specified textual description on summary pages.
If your description includes an equals sign then escape it with a backslash.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-desc "<a href\e='http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net'>SchemaSpy</a>". 
.Ed
.It Fl all
Evaluate all schemas in a database.
Generates a high-level index of the schemas evaluated and allows for traversal of cross-schema foreign key relationships.
Use with
.Fl schemaSpec Ar regex
to narrow-down the schemas to include. 
.It Fl schemas Ar "schema1,schema2"
Evaluate specified schemas.
Similar to
.Fl all ,
but explicitly specifies which schema to evaluate without interrogating the database's metadata.
Can be used with databases like MySQL where a database isn't composed of multiple schemas. 
.It Fl meta Ar metafile
.Ar metafile
is either the name of an individual XML file or the directory that contains meta files.
If a directory is specified then it is expected to contain files matching the pattern
.Pa [schema].meta.xml .
For databases that don't have schema substitute database for schema.
See Providing Additional Metadata on the website for details. 
.It Fl connprops Ar propsfile
.It Fl connprops Ar key\e=value
Specifies additional properties to be used when connecting to the database.
Either specify a
.Pa .properties
file (with
.Pa key=value
entries) or specify the entries directly, escaping the ='s with \= and separating each
.Pa key\e=value
pair with a semi-colon.
.It Fl i Ar tableNamesRegex
Only include matching tables/views.
This is a regular expression that's used to determine which tables/views to include.
For example:
.Fl i Pa "(.*book.*)|(library.*)"
includes only those tables/views with 'book' in their names or that start with 'library'.
You might want to use
.Fl desc
with this option to describe the subset of tables. 
.It Fl I Ar tableNamesRegex
Exclude matching tables/views.
This regular expression excludes matching tables/views from the analysis.
Can be used in conjunction with
.Fl i .
.It Fl x Ar columnNamesRegex
Exclude matching columns from relationship analysis to simplify the generated graphs.
This is a regular expression that's used to determine which columns to exclude.
It must match table name, followed by a dot, followed by column name.
For example:
.Fl x Pa "(book.isbn)|(borrower.address)"
Note that each column name regular expression must be surround by ()'s and separated from other column names by a |.
Excluded relationships will still show up on detail pages. 
.It Fl X Ar columnNamesRegex
Same as
.Fl x
but excluded relationships will not show up on detail pages.
.It Fl noviews
Exclude all views.
.It Fl ahic
Allow HTML In Comments.
Any HTML embedded in comments normally gets encoded so that it's rendered as text.
This option allows it to be rendered as HTML.
.It Fl norows
Don't query or display row counts.
.It Fl noimplied
Don't include implied foreign key relationships in the generated table details.
.It Fl sso
Single Sign-On.
Don't require a user to be specified with
.Fl u
to simplify configuration when running in a single sign-on environment.
.It Fl pfp
Prompt For Password.
Prompts for the password so it doesn't appear on the command line.
.It Fl nohtml
Only generate files needed for insertion/deletion of data (e.g. for scripts) and an XML representation of the schema
.It Fl loglevel
Specifies how verbose logging of programmatic flow should be.
The levels in descending order are:
.Ar severe ,
.Ar warning ,
.Ar info ,
.Ar config ,
.Ar fine ,
.Ar finer ,
.Ar finest .
