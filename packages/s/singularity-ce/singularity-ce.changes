- Fixed i586 builds
- Udated to 3.10.2 with following changes:
  * Ensure no empty if branch is present in generated OCI image runscripts.
    Would prevent execution of container by other tools that are not using
    mvdan.cc/sh.
  * Debug output can now be enabled by setting the SINGULARITY_DEBUG env var.
  * Debug output is now shown for nested singularity calls, in wrapped
    unsquashfs image extraction, and build stages.
  * Fix test code that implied %test -c <shell> was supported - it is not.
  * Fix compilation on mipsel.
