  <title>The new-generation syslog-daemon</title>
  <description>syslog-ng is a &quot;new-generation&quot; syslogd (replacement) for Unix and
Unix-like systems. It tries to fill the gaps in the original syslogd:

* powerful configurability
* filtering based on message content
* portability
* better network forwarding
