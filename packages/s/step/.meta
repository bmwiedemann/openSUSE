  <title>Step - A interactive physics simulator</title>
  <description>Step is an interactive physical simulator. It works like this: you
place some bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or
springs, then click &quot;Simulate&quot; and Step shows you how your scene will
evolve according to the laws of physics. You can change every property
of bodies/forces in your experiment (even during simulation) and see
how this will change evolution of the experiment. With Step you can not
only learn but feel how physics works !</description>
