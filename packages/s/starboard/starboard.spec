%description
Starboard integrates security tools into the Kubernetes environment, so that users can find and view the risks that relate to different resources in a Kubernetes-native way. Starboard provides custom resources definitions and a Go module to work with a range of existing security scanners, as well as a kubectl-compatible command, the Octant plugin, and the Lens extension that make security reports available through familiar Kubernetes tools.
