  <title>Local to Remote Website Synchronizer</title>
  <description>Sitecopy is useful for copying locally stored web sites to remote web
servers. The program will upload files which have changed locally to
the server and delete files from the server which have been removed
locally to keep the remote site synchronized with the local site, all
with a single command.	The aim is to remove the hassle of uploading
and deleting individual files using an FTP client. FTP, WebDAV, and
HTTP-based authoring servers are supported.</description>
