  <title>Sar and Iostat Commands for Linux</title>
  <description>Sar and Iostat commands for Linux. The sar command collects and reports
system activity information. The iostat command reports CPU statistics
and I/O statistics for TTY devices and disks.  The information
collected by sar and iostat can be saved in a binary file for future
inspection. Both commands now support SMP machines when displaying CPU
utilization.</description>
