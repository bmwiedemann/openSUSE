Thu Sep 11 19:34:56 UTC 2025 - Jan-Luca Kiok <opensuse-packages@jlk.one>

- Update to version 0.11.0:
  *  BREAKING
    * **IMPORTANT**: --format xrgb is no longer supported. Use
      --format argb instead. However, this is now the default, so,
      if you  want, you can simply not set anything instead. We
      still accept --format xrgb  so as to not break any
      configurations. Previously, the daemon automatically  would
      check to see which wayland_shm format was the most convenient
      for us to use. However, many people have had weird bugs when
      using any format other  than xrgb. Therefore, we have made
      that the default, and only change it when  the user
      specifically asks for it.
    * swww query now returns information in the following format:
      <namespace>: OUTPUT: SIZE, scale: SCALE, currently
      displaying: IMAGE_OR_COLOR
    * we are creating the socket in a slightly different location now:
      ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}-swww-daemon.<specified
      namespace>.socket
  *  Additions
    * every command (except clear-cache) now accepts a
      -n|--namespace argument. This namespace will then be appended
      to swww-daemon to make up the wayland namespace of the
      daemon's layer surface.
    * as a convenience, every command (except clear-cache) also
      accepts a -a|--all flag, that lets the user send commands to
      all namespaces at once.
    * support avif decoding through dav1d, with the --features=avif
      compilation option.
    * we finally support static SVGs!
    * swww-daemon now correctly renders static images with
      transparency.
    * swww clear now accepts colors with an alpha value.
  *  Fixes
    * Fixed a division by 0 when animating with no frames
    * Fixed destroying wayland buffers too early
    * Better fractional-scale implementation (we shamelessly tried
      copying the swaybg implementation). This will hopefully
      prevent newer issues with hyprland.
