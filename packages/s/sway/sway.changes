      wlc team!)
    Mouse support for swaybar (thanks @deklov!)
    New bar command wrap_scroll [yes|no] allows you to wrap when
      scrolling through workspaces with swaybar (thanks @SirCmpwn!)

      floated by default (thanks @SirCmpwn!)
    The IPC get_tree message is implemented (thanks @zandrmartin!)
    IPC window events have been implemented (thanks @Hummer12007!)
    Swaylock has a new -f option which will cause it to fork into the
      background (which matches i3lock's behavior) (thanks
      @SethBarberee!)
    The focus child i3 command has been implemented (thanks @acrisci!)
    Spawned processes now keep track of what workspace was active when
      they were started and will open subsequent windows there (thanks
      @zandrmartin!)
    Backgrounds can now be a solid color (thanks @zandrmartin!)

   Bugs Fixed

      was fixed (thanks @Hummer12007!)

    A regression and a bug in hide_edge_borders was fixed (thanks
      @zandrmartin and @thejan2009!)
    A bug with smart_gaps and outer gaps 0 was fixed (thanks
      @thejan2009!)
    floating_scroll events are no longer passed through to windows
      (thanks @thejan2009!)
    IPC command results are encapsulated in a JSON array to match i3
      behavior (thanks @acrisci!)
    focus parent no longer attempts to focus anything higher than a
      workspace (thanks @acrisci!)
    Window titles are now rendered appropriately when a parent of them
      is focused (thanks @acrisci!)
    Windows spawned on empty workspaces with the tabbed/stacked
      layouts could spawn with 0x0 geometry (thanks @thejan2009!)

      (thanks @thejan2009!)

      with the SWAY_CURSOR_THEME and SWAY_CURSOR_SIZE environment

      dump happen, which we'll be asking you to upload for us when
      reporting crashes (thanks @SirCmpwn!)
    Title bars of containers are now constructed based on their
      children's app IDs instead of their titles, which matches i3
      behavior more or less (thanks @thejan2009!)
    Log messages are now timestamped (thanks @acrisci!)
    Some performance improvements in the form of more timely window
      arrangement calls were made (thanks @zandrmartin!)
