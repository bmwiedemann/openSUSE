- XDP 0.18.0 requires desktop and other environments to have their own portals.conf
  by adding sway-portals.conf, we will avoid some of the problems for portals for
  * File picker -> We default to xdp-gtk since xdp-wlr does not have it.
  * For screenshots/screenshare, we use the wlr supplied interfaces

  For more information, see https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/1077

      @SethBarberee!)
    The focus child i3 command has been implemented (thanks @acrisci!)
    Spawned processes now keep track of what workspace was active when
