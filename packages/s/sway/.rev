   Changes
    /etc/sway/security has been moved to
      /etc/sway/security.d/00-defaults and users are now encouraged to
      add their own security configurations as additional files in

      with sway and require special permissions are encouraged to ship
      security configs in this directory as well (@SirCmpwn - #1080)

      rather than defaulting to /usr/lib (@Hummer12007 - #1050)
    Default backgrounds have been losslessly re-compressed and should
      reduce the package weight if enabled (@Jesin - #1032)
    Previously undocumented features (swaygrab -f and
      hide_edge_borders) are now covered by their respective manuals
      (@Hummer12007, @ametisf - #1073, #1051)

      41f7aaa)
   New Features
    New automatic layouts unique to sway have been implemented that
      behave like similar features in WMs like Awesome. See sway(5) and

    Sway now supports gamma adjustment, which you can take advantage
      of with a patched redshift (@SirCmpwn - #1019)
    IPC features can now be secured on a per-application basis - see
      sway-security(7) (@SirCmpwn - #1080)

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 1.0:
  * We have completely overhauled the codebase. Some behaviors were changed
    to match i3 behavior, in breaking ways. There are likely many bugs we
    don't know about. Your millage may vary.
  * swaygrab has been removed. For screenshots, try grim, and for video
    capture try wlstream[2]
  * This release depends on wlroots 0.5 and drops the dependency on wlc.
  * This release depends on scdoc for generating man pages, and drops
    the dependency on asciidoc.
  * Experimental Nvidia support has been deprecated since its inception,
    and has now been removed entirely. Please use nouveau and consider future
    purchases from GPU vendors that support open source. Other proprietary
    drivers are also unsupported.
  * swaylock is now distributed separately
  * swayidle, a new idle management daemon, is available separately
  * 100% i3 compatible*
  * 100% i3 IPC compatible*
  * 100% i3-gaps compatible
  * 100% i3bar compatible
  * swayidle, a daemon for managing DPMS and idle activity (e.g. automatic
    lock after a timeout), has been added - man swayidle to get started
  * swaynag, an i3-nagbar replacement, has been added, with additional
    features not supported by i3-nagbar - man swaynag to get started
  * bindsym --locked now adds keybindings which work when the screen is
    locked
  * Command blocks are now generic and work with any command
  * Window opacity can now be adjusted with the opacity command
  * border csd now enables client-side decorations explicitly
  * Atomic layout updates ensure that, when resizing windows and adjusting
    your layout, you never see an invalid frame with partially drawn clients</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 1.1.1:
  *  swaybar now includes touch support - tapping to activate
     hotspots and dragging across to cycle through workspaces
  *  You can now manually inhibit idle notifications (DPMS) when a
     certain criteria is active via inhibit_idle
  *  Keybindings can now be unconfigured at runtime via
     unbind{sym,code,switch}
  *  workspace {prev,next}_on_output --create will create the
     next workspace instead of wrapping to the start
  *  Output subpixel layouts can now be explicitly configured
  *  i3bar's short_text properties in the JSON protocol are
     now supported
  *  swaybar now supports an &quot;overlay&quot; mode, which shows the bar
     on top of other windows and doesn't process input events
  *  Switch devices (like lid switches) are now supported and
     can be bound to actions via bindswitch
  *  swaymsg now supports a -p/--pretty option for explicitly
     enabling pretty-printing
  * More details: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/releases/tag/1.1
