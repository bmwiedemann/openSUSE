%description
Schism Tracker is a reimplementation of Impulse Tracker, a
program used to create music without the requirements of
specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel"
that is difficult to replicate in-part. The player is based on a
modified version of the Modplug engine, with a number of
bugfixes and changes to improve IT playback.
