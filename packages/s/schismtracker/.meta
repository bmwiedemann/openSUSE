  <title>Music editor that aims to match the look and feel of Impulse Tracker</title>
  <description>Schism Tracker is a free reimplementation of Impulse Tracker, a
program used to create high quality music without the requirements of
specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique &quot;finger feel&quot;
that is difficult to replicate in-part. The player is based on a
highly modified version of the Modplug engine, with a number of
bugfixes and changes to improve IT playback.</description>
