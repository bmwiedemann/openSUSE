  <title>Displays Scheduler Statistics</title>
  <description>This utility will process statistics from /proc/schedstat such that the
busiest stats will bubble up to the top.  It can alternately be sorted by
the largest stat, or by name.  Stats can be included or excluded based on
reg-ex pattern matching.</description>
