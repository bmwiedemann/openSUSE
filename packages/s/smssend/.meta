  <title>interface to internet SMS forwarding services</title>
  <description>smssend is a utility providing a command line interface to the GSM
Short Message Service (SMS) via internet gateways. It requires an
active internet connection (HTTP proxy is suitable) and may require a
registration for such gateways. The program is quite configurable for
