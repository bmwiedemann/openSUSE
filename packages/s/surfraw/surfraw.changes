Sat Mar 30 11:04:50 UTC 2019 - John Vandenberg <jayvdb@gmail.com>

- Create subpackages for opensearch and woffle as they have
  different dependencies, with opensearch disabled due to
  dependencies not in factory

- Add missing dependencies
- Activate the tests.  While they mostly fail due to no internet,
  they are useful to spot missing dependencies.
- Remove two elvi which depend on apt-cache, suited for Debian systems
- Remove /etc/xdg from directories owned by this package
- Add test-show-failing-url.patch for debugging purpose

    Commons), springer (journals and books), urban (Urban Dictionary), and aur
