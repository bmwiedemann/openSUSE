  <title>Command Line Interface to WWW Search Engines</title>
  <description>Surfraw provides a Unix command line interface to a variety of WWW search engines and other artifacts of information and makes them available as extensions to the shell.
Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Interpretation of linguistic forms is handed back to the shell.
