- Update to version 2025.3
  Important changes
  * Deprecated DirBuster wordlists
    The dirbuster wordlists were made in 2007, and are now
    considered obsolete. Instead, these wordlists are recommended
    for testing modern web environments:
    + Discovery/Web-Content/combined_words.txt
    + Discovery/Web-Content/combined_directories.txt
    The dirbuster wordlists will remain contained in SecLists, but
    they now have the DirBuster-2007 prefix to highlight their age.
  * Dangerous SQLi payloads
    The SQL Injection wordlists contained in Fuzzing/Databases/SQLi
    are not safe to use on production environments. Many of those
    wordlists contain potentially destructive queries which may
    permanently delete data on any databases they're used on. A
    warning has been added to the README.md for that directory.

    fuzzing/discovery.
    * Discovery/DNS/FUZZSUBS_CYFARE_1.txt
    * Discovery/DNS/FUZZSUBS_CYFARE_2.txt
  * All words wordlists have been moved into the directory
    Miscellaneous/Words/.
