  <title>SQLite JDBC Driver</title>
  <description>SQLite JDBC is a library for accessing and creating SQLite database files in Java.

Our SQLiteJDBC library requires no configuration since native libraries for major OSs, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc., are assembled into a single JAR (Java Archive) file. The usage is quite simple; download our sqlite-jdbc library, then append the library (JAR file) to your class path.</description>
