    <comment>- update to version 123.0.1
- This is a bugfix to 123.0, where the schedule editing did not really work. 
- Also pak48, pak128, pak128.german and pak64.german got updates.
- This release is build from svn revision number 10421. This number is configured to allow
network games to be able to connect to an online server running the same stable version.
- Complete history can be found at (unofficial):
  https://github.com/aburch/simutrans/blob/master/simutrans/history.txt
- From now on, the build is configured to use the zstd compression library for saving. Previously 
this was done with bzip2 compression, but zstd can replace it. Zstd is faster (advantage) 
but also leads to larger files (disadvantage). Usually network games using zstd, since speed is an issue. 
So for maximum network gaming compatibility, zstd is recommended.
- Drop upstream patch: patch-bugs.patch

    <comment>- update to version 124.1
- This version mostly fixes bugs reported for previous version 124.0, 
with some features added to the top. There are also some changes related to packaging:
1. The 124 release made Freetype a required dependency, but the build system 
was not updated to reflect that. As a result, you could compile Simutrans 
without Freetype, only for the game to fail at launch because 
it could not use any font. We have fixed this for the 124.1 release, 
and now Freetype is also required for building (except for server builds).
2. The &quot;.desktop&quot; file has been renamed and moved to &quot;src/linux/simutrans.desktop&quot;.
- See for more information about the 124.1 and the 124.0 releases: 
https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/board,3.0.html
- Patch simutrans-makefile.patch added since GNU make version on OpenSuse 15.5 and 15.6 
does not support hashtags inside shell commands properly 
while the Gnu Make in Tumbleweed works correctly.
