https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,23253.msg208733.html#msg208733

Mon Jan 27 15:18:56 UTC 2025 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 124.3

- simutrans failed with: "FATAL ERROR: gui_theme_t::init_gui_themes - Wrong theme loaded". 
This is caused by the lacking theme pak files in the simutrans src file (as supplied upstream).
All atempts to build the themes with the supplied build_themes.sh script failed.
Hence, the needed files were retrieved from the Subversion source.
- patched the build_themes.sh, reported upstream as: https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,23401.0.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 13:38:13 UTC 2025 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 124.3

- see for more information about this release:
https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,23369.0.html
- in the words of prissi: "This release saw lots of bugfixing. 
It features also two new tools, a pipette tool that lets you build whatever 
you have clicked on (if allowed) and a marco editor, where you can copy 
your favorite airport (or whatever layout) and build it again 
by a single mouse click. Finally, the tutorial saw major rework 
and is much more stable."

Wed Jul 31 08:13:14 UTC 2024 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 124-2-1

- update to version 124.2.1 (r11351 on 20-July-2024)
- skipping update version 124.2
- See for more information about the 124.2 and the 124.2.1 releases:
https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,23153.0.html
https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,23162.0.html
- Summary by prissi: 
The version 124.2 started as another bugfix as there were 
many annoying bugs even in the 124.1. However, some additional 
change elevates this beyond a patch. Most are GUI improvements, 
like saving the windows now even with network games. 
The most dramatic change for a user is the new way builder. 
If a new way starts one tile from an existing way 
and ends one tile from an existing way, it will now try 
very hard to make a parallel track. 
It works as good as it can do without terraforming. 
It may still join at a place where it cannot pass next to it 
but then go parallel again, greatly saving efforts 
(especially with diagonals).
- Only for the 124.2, there is a README file with 
the list of changes at 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/simutrans/files/simutrans/124-2/README.txt/download

Mon Jun  3 16:43:23 UTC 2024 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 124-1

- update to version 124.1
- This version mostly fixes bugs reported for previous version 124.0, 
with some features added to the top. There are also some changes related to packaging:
1. The 124 release made Freetype a required dependency, but the build system 
was not updated to reflect that. As a result, you could compile Simutrans 
without Freetype, only for the game to fail at launch because 
it could not use any font. We have fixed this for the 124.1 release, 
and now Freetype is also required for building (except for server builds).
2. The ".desktop" file has been renamed and moved to "src/linux/simutrans.desktop".
- See for more information about the 124.1 and the 124.0 releases: 
https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/board,3.0.html
- Patch simutrans-makefile.patch added since GNU make version on OpenSuse 15.5 and 15.6 
does not support hashtags inside shell commands properly 
while the Gnu Make in Tumbleweed works correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 13:23:52 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  PatchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 17:06:51 UTC 2022 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 123-0-1

- update to version 123.0.1
- This is a bugfix to 123.0, where the schedule editing did not really work. 
- Also pak48, pak128, pak128.german and pak64.german got updates.
- This release is build from svn revision number 10421. This number is configured to allow
network games to be able to connect to an online server running the same stable version.
- Complete history can be found at (unofficial):
  https://github.com/aburch/simutrans/blob/master/simutrans/history.txt
- From now on, the build is configured to use the zstd compression library for saving. Previously 
this was done with bzip2 compression, but zstd can replace it. Zstd is faster (advantage) 
but also leads to larger files (disadvantage). Usually network games using zstd, since speed is an issue. 
So for maximum network gaming compatibility, zstd is recommended.
- Drop upstream patch: patch-bugs.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 17:31:29 UTC 2022 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 123-0

- update to version 123.0
- The most noticeable change will be the new GUI, which is now enforced in all dialogs. 
You can now also schedule convois with fixed departure times, if you want to play 
model railroad. Rivers now go from their source through lakes until the sea, and 
are shippable after passing a lake. Paks can be installed now ingame. There were 
of course also lot of bugfixes, not least thanks to the automatic testing.
- This release is build from svn revision number 10317.
- Added patch-bugs.patch
- Since the release contains some severe regression bugs, which were solved in the weeks after the release, 
the solutions were included here. See for the bugs: 
1: Map showing network: https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,21320.0.html 
2: The new setting  stop_halt_as_scheduled should be disabled by default:

Sun Oct 11 17:08:01 UTC 2020 - Michiel van der Wulp <michiel.vanderwulp@gmail.com> - 122-0

- update to version 122.0
- In the words of "prissi": It packed with new things hidden and in plain view. 
  Like a much more stable server, optimisations for tablet usage and only games in lists, 
  fast map creation, multi-tiled rotatable city buildings, 
  better use of fixed monthly convoi costs, further improvement of the GUI, depot list, 
  list of all existing vehicles, climates optional calculated from height and humidity 
  and tons of bug fixes, also the scripted AI got rail support (still under optimisation).
