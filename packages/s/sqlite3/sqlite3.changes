  * The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database
    filenames to create a canonical name for the database before
    the file is opened

    needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization
    turns out to never be used
  * The HAVING clause of a SELECT statement is now allowed on any
    aggregate query, even queries that do not have a GROUP BY
    clause
  * Many microoptimizations collectively reduce CPU cycles by about
    2.3%.

- update to 3.38.5:
  * Fix a blunder in the CLI of the 3.38.4 release
- includes changes from 3.38.4:
  * fix a byte-code problem in the Bloom filter pull-down
    optimization added by release 3.38.0 in which an error in the
    byte code causes the byte code engine to enter an infinite loop
    when the pull-down optimization encounters a NULL key   

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 05:54:02 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 3.38.3:
  * Fix a case of the query planner be overly aggressive with
    optimizing automatic-index and Bloom-filter construction,
    using inappropriate ON clause terms to restrict the size of the
    automatic-index or Bloom filter, and resulting in missing rows
    in the output.
  * Other minor patches. See the timeline for details. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 29 08:21:26 UTC 2022 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- update to 3.38.2:
  * Fix a problem with the Bloom filter optimization that might
    cause an incorrect answer when doing a LEFT JOIN with a WHERE
    clause constraint that says that one of the columns on the
    right table of the LEFT JOIN is NULL.
  * Other minor patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 16:24:45 UTC 2022 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

    even in corner cases such as when the argument is a virtual
    column or the column of a view.
  * Fix row value IN operator constraints on virtual tables so that
    they work correctly even if the virtual table implementation
    relies on bytecode to filter rows that do not satisfy the
    constraint.
  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements, test cases, and
    documentation. See the source code timeline for details.
- add upstream patch to run atof1 tests only on x86_64
  sqlite-src-3380100-atof1.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 26 11:20:10 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.38.0
  * Add the -> and ->> operators for easier processing of JSON

  * Enhancements to date and time functions
  * Rename the printf() SQL function to format() for better
    compatibility, with alias for backwards compatibility.
  * Add the sqlite3_error_offset() interface for helping localize
    an SQL error to a specific character in the input SQL text 
  * Enhance the interface to virtual tables 
  * CLI columnar output modes are enhanced to correctly handle tabs
    and newlines embedded in text, and add options like "--wrap N",
    "--wordwrap on", and "--quote" to the columnar output modes.
  * Query planner enhancements using a Bloom filter to speed up 
    large analytic queries, and a balanced merge tree to evaluate
    UNION or UNION ALL compound SELECT statements that have an
    ORDER BY clause.
  * The ALTER TABLE statement is changed to silently ignores
    entries in the sqlite_schema table that do not parse when
    PRAGMA writable_schema=ON

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 12 20:25:08 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.37.2:
  * Fix a bug introduced in version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) that can
    cause database corruption if a SAVEPOINT is rolled back while
    in PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY mode, and other changes are made,
    and then the outer transaction commits
  * Fix a long-standing problem with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON 
    UPDATE CASCADE in which a cache of the bytecode used to
    implement the cascading change was not being reset following a
    local DDL change

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  2 12:12:55 UTC 2022 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.37.1:
  * Fix a bug introduced by the UPSERT enhancements of version

    database files.
  * Improved robustness of the --safe option in the CLI.
  * Other minor fixes to assert() statements and test cases. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 09:08:31 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- SQLite3 3.37.0:
  * STRICT tables provide a prescriptive style of data type
    management, for developers who prefer that kind of thing.
  * When adding columns that contain a CHECK constraint or a
    generated column containing a NOT NULL constraint, the
    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN now checks new constraints against
    preexisting rows in the database and will only proceed if no
    constraints are violated.
  * Added the PRAGMA table_list statement.
  * Add the .connection command, allowing the CLI to keep multiple
    database connections open at the same time.
  * Add the --safe command-line option that disables dot-commands
    and SQL statements that might cause side-effects that extend
    beyond the single database file named on the command-line.
  * CLI: Performance improvements when reading SQL statements that
    span many lines.
  * Added the sqlite3_autovacuum_pages() interface.
  * The sqlite3_deserialize() does not and has never worked
    for the TEMP database. That limitation is now noted in the
    documentation.
  * The query planner now omits ORDER BY clauses on subqueries and
    views if removing those clauses does not change the semantics
    of the query.
  * The generate_series table-valued function extension is modified
    so that the first parameter ("START") is now required. This is
    done as a way to demonstrate how to write table-valued
    functions with required parameters. The legacy behavior is
    available using the -DZERO_ARGUMENT_GENERATE_SERIES
    compile-time option.
  * Added new sqlite3_changes64() and sqlite3_total_changes64()
    interfaces.
  * Added the SQLITE_OPEN_EXRESCODE flag option to sqlite3_open_v2().
  * Use less memory to hold the database schema.
  * bsc#1189802, CVE-2021-36690: Fix an issue with the SQLite Expert
    extension when a column has no collating sequence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 22 08:55:36 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- SQLite3 3.36.0:
  * Improvement to the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output to make it
    easier to understand.
  * Byte-order marks at the start of a token are skipped
    as if they were whitespace.
  * An error is raised on any attempt to access the rowid of a VIEW
    or subquery. Formerly, the rowid of a VIEW would be indeterminate
    and often would be NULL. The -DSQLITE_ALLOW_ROWID_IN_VIEW
    compile-time option is available to restore the legacy behavior
    for applications that need it.
  * The sqlite3_deserialize() and sqlite3_serialize() interfaces
    are now enabled by default. The -DSQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE
    compile-time option is no longer required. Instead, there is 
    a new -DSQLITE_OMIT_DESERIALIZE compile-time option to omit
    those interfaces.
  * The "memdb" VFS now allows the same in-memory database
    to be shared among multiple database connections in the same
    process as long as the database name begins with "/".
  * Back out the EXISTS-to-IN optimization (item 8b in the
    SQLite 3.35.0 change log) as it was found to slow down
    queries more often than speed them up.
  * Improve the constant-propagation optimization so that it works
    on non-join queries.
  * The REGEXP extension is now included in CLI builds. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 08:52:23 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite3 3.35.5:
  * Fix defects in the new ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN feature that
    could corrupt the database file
  * Fix an obscure query optimizer problem that might cause an
    incorrect query result

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  6 14:57:30 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- SQLite 3.35.4:
  * Fix a defect in the query planner optimization
  * Fix a defect in the new RETURNING syntax
  * Fix the new RETURNING feature so that it raises an error if one
    of the terms in the RETURNING clause references a unknown
    table, instead of silently ignoring that error
  * Fix an assertion associated with aggregate function processing
    that was incorrectly triggered by the push-down optimization

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 27 11:52:17 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite 3.35.3:
  * Enhance the OP_OpenDup opcode of the bytecode engine so that
    it works even if the cursor being duplicated itself came from
    OP_OpenDup
  * When materializing correlated common table expressions, do so
    separately for each use case, as that is required for
    correctness. This fixes a problem that was introduced by the 
    MATERIALIZED hint enhancement.
  * Fix a problem in the filename normalizer of the unix VFS
  * Fix the "box" output mode in the CLI so that it works with
    statements that returns one or more rows of zero columns
    (such as PRAGMA incremental_vacuum)
  * Improvements to error messages generated by faulty common
    table expressions
  * Fix some incorrect assert() statements
  * Fix to the SELECT statement syntax diagram so that the FROM
    clause syntax is shown correctly
  * Fix the EBCDIC character classifier so that it understands
    newlines as whitespace
  * Improvements the xBestIndex method in the implementation of the
    (unsupported) wholenumber virtual table extension so that it
    does a better job of convincing the query planner to avoid
    trying to materialize a table with an infinite number of rows
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 19 14:53:04 UTC 2021 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Fix typo in macro definition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 17 21:39:16 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite 3.35.2:
  * Fix a problem in the appendvfs.c extension that was introduced
    into version 3.35.0.
  * Ensure that date/time functions with no arguments (which
    generate responses that depend on the current time) are treated
    as non-deterministic functions.
  * Fix a problem in the sqldiff utility program having to do with
    unusual whitespace characters in a virtual table definition.
  * Limit the new UNION ALL optimization described by item 8c in
    the 3.35.0 release so that it does not try to make too many
    new subqueries.
- include changes from 3.35.1:
  * Fix a bug in the new DROP COLUMN feature when used on columns
    that are indexed and that are quoted in the index definition.
  * Improve the built-in documentation for the .dump command in the
    CLI. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 15 07:59:12 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.35.0:
  * Added built-in SQL math functions().
    (Requires the -DSQLITE_ENABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS compile-time option.)
  * Added support for ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN.
  * Generalize UPSERT:
      * Allow multiple ON CONFLICT clauses that are evaluated in order,
      * The final ON CONFLICT clause may omit the conflict target and yet still use DO UPDATE.
  * Add support for the RETURNING clause on DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE statements.
  * Use less memory when running VACUUM on databases containing very large TEXT
    or BLOB values. It is no longer necessary to hold the entire TEXT or BLOB
    in memory all at once.
  * Add support for the MATERIALIZED and NOT MATERIALIZED hints when specifying
    common table expressions. The default behavior was formerly NOT
    MATERIALIZED, but is now changed to MATERIALIZED for CTEs that are used
    more than once.
  * The SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_TRIGGER and SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_VIEW settings
    are modified so that they only control triggers and views in the main
    database schema or in attached database schemas and not in the TEMP schema.
    TEMP triggers and views are always allowed.
  * Query planner/optimizer improvements
  * Enhance the ".stats" command to accept new arguments "stmt" and "vmstep",
    causing prepare statement statistics and only the virtual-machine step
    count to be shown, respectively.
  * Add the ".filectrl data_version" command.
  * Enhance the ".once" and ".output" commands so that if the destination
    argument begins with "|" (indicating that output is redirected into a pipe)
    then the argument does not need to be quoted.
  * Fix a bug in the IN-operator optimization of version 3.33.0 that can cause
    an incorrect answer.
  * Fix incorrect answers from the LIKE operator if the pattern ends with "%"
    and there is an "ESCAPE '_'" clause. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 20:13:10 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite 3.34.1:
  * Fix a potential use-after-free bug when processing a a subquery
    with both a correlated WHERE clause and a "HAVING 0" clause and
    where the parent query is an aggregate (boo#1181261)
  * Fix documentation typos
  * Fix minor problems in extensions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 09:08:39 UTC 2020 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- SQLite 3.34.0:
  * Added the sqlite3_txn_state() interface for reporting on the
    current transaction state of the database connection.
  * Enhance recursive common table expressions to support two or more
    recursive terms as is done by SQL Server, since this helps make
    queries against graphs easier to write and faster to execute.
  * Improved error messages on CHECK constraint failures.
  * The .read dot-command now accepts a pipeline in addition to a
    filename.
  * Added options --data-only and --nosys to the .dump dot-command.
  * Added the --nosys option to the .schema dot-command.
  * Table name quoting works correctly for the .import dot-command.
  * The generate_series(START,END,STEP) table-valued function
    extension is now built into the CLI.
  * The .databases dot-command now show the status of each database
    file as determined by sqlite3_db_readonly() and
    sqlite3_txn_state().
  * Added the --tabs command-line option that sets .mode tabs.
  * The --init option reports an error if the file named as its
    argument cannot be opened. The --init option also now honors the
    --bail option.
  * Improved estimates for the cost of running a DISTINCT operator.
  * When doing an UPDATE or DELETE using a multi-column index where
    only a few of the earlier columns of the index are useful for the
    index lookup, postpone doing the main table seek until after all
    WHERE clause constraints have been evaluated, in case those
    constraints can be covered by unused later terms of the index,
    thus avoiding unnecessary main table seeks.
  * The new OP_SeekScan opcode is used to improve performance of
    multi-column index look-ups when later columns are constrained by
    an IN operator.
  * The BEGIN IMMEDIATE and BEGIN EXCLUSIVE commands now work even if
    one or more attached database files are read-only.
  * Enhanced FTS5 to support trigram indexes.
  * Improved performance of WAL mode locking primitives in cases where
    there are hundreds of connections all accessing the same database
    file at once.
  * Enhanced the carray() table-valued function to include a
    single-argument form that is bound using the auxiliary
    sqlite3_carray_bind() interface.
  * The substr() SQL function can now also be called "substring()" for
    compatibility with SQL Server.
  * The syntax diagrams are now implemented as Pikchr scripts and
    rendered as SVG for improved legibility and ease of maintenance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 15 06:04:07 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite 3.33.0:
  * Support for UPDATE FROM following the PostgreSQL syntax
  * Increase the maximum size of database files to 281 TB
  * Extend the PRAGMA integrity_check statement so that it can
    optionally be limited to verifying just a single table and its
    indexes, rather than the entire database file.
  * Add the decimal extension for doing arbitrary-precision decimal
    arithmetic
  * Enhancements to the ieee754 extension for working with IEEE 754
    binary64 numbers
  * cli: Add four new output modes: "box", "json", "markdown",
    and "table"
  * cli: The "column" output mode automatically expands columns to
    contain the longest output row and automatically turns
    ".header" on if it has not been previously set
  * cli: The "quote" output mode honors ".separator"
  * cli: The decimal extension and the ieee754 extension are
    built-in to the CLI 
  * multiple query planner improvements

Fri Oct 11 15:05:00 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- sqlite 3.30.1:
  * fix a segfault for nested queries that use the FILTER clause
    ib aggregate functions (introduced in 3.30.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  6 15:43:57 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.30.0:
  * Add support for the FILTER clause on aggregate functions
  * Add support for the NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST syntax in ORDER BY clauses
  * The index_info and index_xinfo pragmas are enhanced to provide
    information about the on-disk representation of WITHOUT ROWID tables
  * Add the sqlite3_drop_modules() interface, allowing applications
    to disable automatically loaded virtual tables that they do not need
  * Improvements to the .recover dot-command in the CLI so that it
    recovers more content from corrupt database files
  * Enhance the RBU extension to support indexes on expressions
  * Change the schema parser so that it will error out if any of
    the type, name, and tbl_name columns of the sqlite_master table
    have been corrupted and the database connection is not in
    writable_schema mode.
  * The PRAGMA function_list, PRAGMA module_list, and PRAGMA
    pragma_list commands are now enabled in all builds by default
  * Add the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_VIEW option for sqlite3_db_config().
  * Added the TCL Interface config method in order to be able to
    disable SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_VIEW as well as control other
    sqlite3_db_config() options from TCL.
  * Added the SQLITE_DIRECTONLY flag for application-defined SQL
    functions to prevent those functions from being used inside
    triggers and views
- drop sqlite3-CVE-2019-16168.patch, upstream

Tue Sep 10 15:17:35 UTC 2019 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- bsc#1150137, CVE-2019-16168, sqlite3-CVE-2019-16168.patch:
  Improper validation of qlite_stat1 sz field leads to division by
  zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 08:59:55 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.29.0
  * Added the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DQS_DML and SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DQS_DDL
    actions to sqlite3_db_config() for activating and deactivating
    the double-quoted string literal misfeature. Both default to 
    "on" for legacy compatibility, but developers are encouraged 
    to turn them "off", perhaps using the -DSQLITE_DQS=0
    compile-time option.
  * -DSQLITE_DQS=0 is now a recommended compile-time option.
  * Improvements to the query planner:
    + Improved optimization of AND and OR operators when one or
      the other operand is a constant.
    + Enhancements to the LIKE optimization for cases when the
      left-hand side column has numeric affinity.
  * Added the "sqlite_dbdata" virtual table for extracting raw
    low-level content from an SQLite database, even a database
    that is corrupt.
  * Enhancements to the CLI:
    + Add the ".recover" command which tries to recover as much
      content as possible from a corrupt database file.
    + Add the ".filectrl" command useful for testing.
    + Add the long-standing ".testctrl" command to the ".help" menu.
    + Added the ".dbconfig" command

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 13:52:28 UTC 2019 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 3.28.0:
  * CVE-2019-9936, bsc#1130326: running fts5 prefix queries inside
    a transaction could trigger a heap-based buffer over-read.
  * CVE-2019-9937, bsc#1130325: interleaving reads and writes in a
    single transaction with an fts5 virtual table will lead to a
    NULL Pointer Dereference.
  * Enhanced window functions
  * Enhanced VACUUM INTO so that it works for read-only databases.
  * New query optimizations.
  * Added the sqlite3_value_frombind() API for determining if the
    argument to an SQL function is from a bound parameter. 
  * Security and compatibilities enhancements to fts3_tokenizer().
  * Improved robustness against corrupt database files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 10 17:37:06 UTC 2019 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SQLite 3.27.2:
  * Add the VACUUM INTO command
  * Issue an SQLITE_WARNING message on the error log if a
    double-quoted string literal is used
  * Add the remove_diacritics=2 option to FTS3 and FTS5.
  * Add  the SQLITE_PREPARE_NO_VTAB option to sqlite3_prepare_v3().
    Use that option to prevent circular references to shadow tables
    from causing resource leaks.
  * Enhancements to the sqlite3_deserialize() interface
  * Enhancements to the CLI, mostly to support testing and debugging
    of the SQLite library itself
  * Increased robustness against malicious SQL that is run against
    a maliciously corrupted database

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  5 12:56:29 UTC 2018 - malte.kraus@suse.com

- SQLite 3.26.0:
  * Optimization: When doing an UPDATE on a table with indexes on
    expressions, do not update the expression indexes if they do
    not refer to any of the columns of the table being updated.
  * Allow the xBestIndex() method of virtual table implementations
    to return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT to indicate that the proposed query
    plan is unusable and should not be given further consideration.
  * Added the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option which disables the
    ability to create corrupt database files using ordinary SQL.
  * Added support for read-only shadow tables when the
    SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option is enabled.
  * Added the PRAGMA legacy_alter_table command, which if enabled
    causes the ALTER TABLE command to behave like older version of
    SQLite (prior to version 3.25.0) for compatibility.
  * Added PRAGMA table_xinfo that works just like PRAGMA table_info
    except that it also shows hidden columns in virtual tables.
  * Added the explain virtual table as a run-time loadable
    extension.
  * Add a limit counter to the query planner to prevent excessive
    sqlite3_prepare() times for certain pathological SQL inputs.
  * Added support for the sqlite3_normalized_sql() interface, when
    compiling with SQLITE_ENABLE_NORMALIZE.
  * Enhanced triggers so that they can use table-valued functions
    that exist in schemas other than the schema where the trigger
    is defined.
  * Improvements to the ".help" command in the CLI.
  * The SQLITE_HISTORY environment variable, if it exists,
    specifies the name of the command-line editing history file.
  * The --deserialize option associated with opening a new database
    in the CLI cause the database file to be read into memory and
    accessed using the sqlite3_deserialize() API. This simplifies
    running tests on a database without modifying the file on disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  6 14:16:07 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- SQLite 3.25.2:

    "ALTER TABLE RENAME" command to behave as in 3.24.0 and earlier
  * Fix issue with some expressions with windows functions in views
- includes changes from SQLite 3.25.1:
  * Avoid false-positive error checks on ALTER TABLE
  * Further ORDER BY LIMIT optimization fixes for window functions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 16 06:51:34 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- SQLite 3.25.0:
  * Add support for window functions
  * Add support for renaming columns within a table
  * Query optimizer improvements
  * slightly better concurrency in multi-threaded environments
  * The ORDER BY LIMIT optimization might have caused an infinite
    loop in the byte code of the prepared statement under very
    obscure circumstances, due to a confluence of minor defects in
    the query optimizer

    empty_result_callbacks=ON
  * Fix the generate_series virtual table so that it correctly
    returns no rows if any of its constraints are NULL
  * Performance enhancements in the parser

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  2 18:33:42 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 3.23.0:
  * Add the sqlite3_serialize() and sqlite3_deserialize()
    interfaces when the SQLITE_ENABLE_DESERIALIZE compile-time
    option is used.
  * Recognize TRUE and FALSE as constants. (For compatibility, if
    there exist columns named "true" or "false", then the
    identifiers refer to the columns rather than Boolean constants.)
  * Support operators IS TRUE, IS FALSE, IS NOT TRUE, and IS NOT FALSE.
  * Added the SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_SPILL option to
    sqlite3_db_status() for reporting the number of cache spills
    that have occurred.
  * The "alternate-form-2" flag ("!") on the built-in printf
    implementation now causes string substitutions to measure the
    width and precision in characters instead of bytes.
  * If the xColumn method in a virtual table implementation returns
    an error message using sqlite3_result_error() then give that
    error message preference over internally-generated messages.
  * Added the -A command-line option to the CLI to make it easier to
    manage SQLite Archive files.
  * Add support for INSERT OR REPLACE, INSERT OR IGNORE, and UPDATE
    OR REPLACE in the Zipfile virtual table.
  * Enhance the sqlite3changeset_apply() interface so that it is
    hardened against attacks from deliberately corrupted changeset
    objects.
  * Added the sqlite3_normalize() extension function.
  * Query optimizer enhancements
  * Various bug fixes

    + CVE-2018-8740: NULL pointer dereference on CREATE TABLE as
      (bsc#1085790)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  1 20:49:08 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 3.22.0:
  * Add Zipfile virtual table to read and write a ZIP Archive.
  * Improved handling of WAL mode databases
  * various improvements, optimizations and bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 25 08:41:37 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 3.21.0
  * Take advantage of the atomic-write capabilities in the F2FS
    filesystem when available, for greatly reduced transaction
    overhead. This currently requires the
    SQLITE_ENABLE_BATCH_ATOMIC_WRITE compile-time option.
  * Allow ATTACH and DETACH commands to work inside of a
    transaction.
  * Allow WITHOUT ROWID virtual tables to be writable if the
    PRIMARY KEY contains exactly one column.
  * The "fsync()" that occurs after the header is written in a
    WAL reset now uses the sync settings for checkpoints.
    This means it will use a "fullfsync" on macs if PRAGMA
    checkpoint_fullfsync set on.
  * The sqlite3_sourceid() function tries to detect if the source
    code has been modified from what is checked into version
    control and if there are modifications, the last four
    characters of the version hash are shown as "alt1" or
    "alt2". The objective is to detect accidental and/or
    careless edits. A forger can subvert this feature.
  * Improved de-quoting of column names for CREATE TABLE AS
    statements with an aggregate query on the right-hand side.
  * Fewer "stat()" system calls issued by the unix VFS.
  * Enhanced the LIKE optimization so that it works with an
    ESCAPE clause.
  * Enhanced PRAGMA integrity_check and PRAGMA quick_check
    to detect obscure row corruption that they were formerly
    missing. Also update both pragmas so that they return
    error text rather than SQLITE_CORRUPT when encountering
    corruption in records.
  * The query planner now prefers to implement FROM-clause
    subqueries using co-routines rather using the query
    flattener optimization. Support for the use of
    co-routines for subqueries may no longer be disabled.
  * Pass information about !=, IS, IS NOT, NOT NULL, and
    IS NULL constraints into the xBestIndex method of virtual tables.
  * Enhanced the CSV virtual table so that it accepts the
    last row of input if the final new-line character is missing.
  * Remove the rarely-used "scratch" memory allocator.
    Replace it with the SQLITE_CONFIG_SMALL_MALLOC configuration
    setting that gives SQLite a hint that large memory allocations
    should be avoided when possible.
  * Added the swarm virtual table to the existing union virtual
    table extension.
  * Added the sqlite_dbpage virtual table for providing direct
    access to pages of the database file. The source code is
    built into the amalgamation and is activated using the
    -DSQLITE_ENABLE_DBPAGE_VTAB compile-time option.
  * Add a new type of fts5vocab virtual table - "instance" 
    - that provides direct access to an FTS5 full-text
    index at the lowest possible level.
  * Miscellaneous microoptimizations reduce CPU usage by about 2.1%.

  Bug fixes
  * Fix a faulty assert() statement discovered by OSSFuzz.
    Ticket cb91bf4290c211d
  * Fix an obscure memory leak in sqlite3_result_pointer().

    in an index-on-expressions is really a constant. Ticket aa98619ad08ddca
  * Fix an assertion fault that could occur following PRAGMA
    reverse_unordered_selects. Ticket cb91bf4290c211d
  * Fix a segfault that can occur for queries that use table-valued
    functions in an IN or EXISTS subquery. Ticket b899b6042f97f5
  * Fix a potential integer overflow problem when compiling a particular
    horrendous common table expression. This was another problem discovered
    by OSSFuzz. Check-in 6ee8cb6ae5.
  * Fix a potential out-of-bound read when querying a corrupt
    database file, a problem detected by Natalie Silvanovich of
    Google Project Zero. Check-in 04925dee41a21f.

    interface

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  2 00:26:35 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- Update to 3.20.0:
  * Potential incompatible change for clients incorrectly relying
    on unspecified behavior: column names returned by
    sqlite3_column_name() and sqlite3_column_name16() may return
    different names when views or subqueries are used in the FROM
    clause, and AS clauses are not used (as they should be)
  * Text of some error messages changed. Applications that depend
    on specific error message text may be impacted.

    Ticket 7fde638e94287d2c.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 18:47:42 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 3.19.0
  * The SQLITE_READ authorizer callback is invoked once with a
    column name that is an empty string for every table referenced
    in a query from which no columns are extracted.
  * When using an index on an expression, try to use expression
    values already available in the index, rather than loading
    the original columns and recomputing the expression.
  * Enhance the flattening optimization so that it is able to
    flatten views on the right-hand side of a LEFT JOIN.
  * Use replace() instead of char() for escaping newline and
    carriage-return characters embedded in strings in the .dump
    output from the command-line shell.
  * Avoid unnecessary foreign key processing in UPDATE statements
    that do not touch the columns that are constrained by the
    foreign keys.
  * On a DISTINCT query that uses an index, try to skip ahead
    to the next distinct entry using the index rather than
    stepping through rows, when an appropriate index is available.
  * Avoid unnecessary invalidation of sqlite3_blob handles
    when making changes to unrelated tables.
  * Transfer any terms of the HAVING clause that use only
    columns mentioned in the GROUP BY clause over to the
    WHERE clause for faster processing.
  * Reuse the same materialization of a VIEW if that VIEW
    appears more than once in the same query.
  * Enhance PRAGMA integrity_check so that it identifies
    tables that have two or more rows with the same rowid.
  * Enhance the FTS5 query syntax so that column filters
    may be applied to arbitrary expressions.
  * Enhance the json_extract() function to cache and
    reuse parses of JSON input text.
  * Added the anycollseq.c loadable extension that allows a
    generic SQLite database connection to read a schema that
    contains unknown and/or application-specific collating sequences.
  * Fix a problem in REPLACE that can result in a corrupt
    database containing two ore more rows with the same rowid.
    Fix for ticket f68dc596c4e6018d.
  * Fix a problem in PRAGMA integrity_check that was causing a
    subsequent VACUUM to behave suboptimally.
    so that it works correctly with foreign keys on WITHOUT ROWID tables.
  * Disallow leading zeros in numeric constants in JSON.
    Fix for ticket b93be8729a895a528e2.
  * Disallow control characters inside of strings in JSON.
    Fix for ticket 6c9b5514077fed34551.
  * Limit the depth of recursion for JSON objects and arrays in orde
    to avoid excess stack usage in the recursive descent parser.
    Fix for ticket 981329adeef51011052.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 31 12:03:54 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 3.18.0
  * Added the PRAGMA optimize command
  * The SQLite version identifier returned by the sqlite_source_id()
    SQL function and the sqlite3_sourceid() C API and found in the
    SQLITE_SOURCE_ID macro is now a 64-digit SHA3-256 hash instead
    of a 40-digit SHA1 hash.
  * Added the json_patch() SQL function to the JSON1 extension.
  * Enhance the LIKE optimization so that it works for arbitrary
    expressions on the left-hand side as long as the LIKE pattern
    on the right-hand side does not begin with a digit or minus sign.
  * Added the sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid() interface and use the
    new interface in the FTS3, FTS4, and FTS5 extensions to ensure
    that the sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() interface always returns
    reasonable values.
  * Enhance PRAGMA integrity_check and PRAGMA quick_check so that
    they verify CHECK constraints.
  * Enhance the query plans for joins to detect empty tables early
    and halt without doing unnecessary work.
  * Enhance the sqlite3_mprintf() family of interfaces and the
    printf SQL function to put comma separators at the thousands
    marks for integers, if the "," format modifier is used in
    between the "%" and the "d" (example: "%,d").
  * Added the -DSQLITE_MAX_MEMORY=N compile-time option.
  * Added the .sha3sum dot-command and the .selftest dot-command
    to the command-line shell
  * Begin enforcing SQLITE_LIMIT_VDBE_OP. This can be used, 
    for example, to prevent excessively large prepared statements 
    in systems that accept SQL queries from untrusted users.
  * Various performance improvements.
  * Ensure that indexed expressions with collating sequences are
    handled correctly. Fix for ticket eb703ba7b50c1a5.
  * Fix a bug in the 'start of ...' modifiers for the date and
    time functions. Ticket 6097cb92745327a1
  * Fix a potential segfault in complex recursive triggers,
    resulting from a bug in the OP_Once opcode introduced as part
    of a performance optimization in version 3.15.0. Ticket 06796225f59c057c
  * In the RBU extension, add extra sync operations to avoid the
    possibility of corruption following a power failure.
  * The sqlite3_trace_v2() output for nested SQL statements should
    always begin with a "--" comment marker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 09:19:28 UTC 2017 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to 3.17.0
  * Approximately 25% better performance from the R-Tree extension.
  * Add the SQLITE_DEFAULT_LOOKASIDE compile-time option.
  * Increase the default lookaside size from 512,125 to 1200,100
    as this provides better performance while only adding 56KB of
    extra memory per connection.
  * Use compiler built-ins __builtin_sub_overflow(), 
    __builtin_add_overflow(), and __builtin_mul_overflow() 
   when available.
  * Added the SQLITE_ENABLE_NULL_TRIM compile-time option, which
    can result in significantly smaller database files for some
    applications, at the risk of being incompatible with older
    versions of SQLite.
  * Change SQLITE_DEFAULT_PCACHE_INITSZ from 100 to 20, for
    improved performance.
  * Added the SQLITE_UINT64_TYPE compile-time option as an analog
    to SQLITE_INT64_TYPE.
  * Perform some UPDATE operations in a single pass instead of in
    two passes.
  * Enhance the session extension to support WITHOUT ROWID tables.
  * Fixed performance problems and potential stack overflows when
    creating views from multi-row VALUES clauses with hundreds of
    thousands of rows.
  * Added the sha1.c extension.
  * In the command-line shell, enhance the ".mode" command so that
    it restores the default column and row separators for modes 
    "line", "list", "column", and "tcl".
  * Enhance the SQLITE_DIRECT_OVERFLOW_READ option so that it
    works in WAL mode as long as the pages being read are not
    in the WAL file.
  * Enhance the LEMON parser generator so that it can store the
    parser object as a stack variable rather than allocating space
    from the heap and make use of that enhancement in the amalgamation.
  * Other performance improvements. Uses about 6.5% fewer CPU cycles.
  * Throw an error if the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN references
    tables to the right of the ON clause. This is the same behavior
    as PostgreSQL. Formerly, SQLite silently converted the LEFT JOIN
    into an INNER JOIN. Fix for ticket 25e335f802dd.
  * Use the correct affinity for columns of automatic indexes.
    Ticket 7ffd1ca1d2ad4ec.
  * Ensure that the sqlite3_blob_reopen() interface can correctly
    handle short rows. Fix for ticket e6e962d6b0f06f46e. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  7 16:44:32 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.16.2:
  * Fix the REPLACE statement for WITHOUT ROWID tables that lack
    secondary indexes so that it works correctly with triggers and
    foreign keys.
  * Fix the sqlite3_value_text() interface so that it correctly
    translates content generated by zeroblob() into a string of all
    0x00 characters.
  * Fix the bytecode generator to deal with a subquery in the FROM
    clause that is itself a UNION ALL where one side of the UNION
    ALL is a view that contains an ORDER BY.
  * Adjust the sqlite3_column_count() API so it more often returns
    the same values for PRAGMA statements as it did in prior
    releases, to minimize disruption to applications that might be
    using that interface in unexpected ways.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    report for details on how the this performance increase was
    computed.)
  * Added experimental support for PRAGMA functions.
  * Added the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_NO_CKPT_ON_CLOSE option to
    sqlite3_db_config().
  * Enhance the date and time functions so that the 'unixepoch'
    modifier works for the full span of supported dates.
  * Changed the default configuration of the lookaside memory
    allocator from 500 slots of 128 bytes each into 125 slots of
    512 bytes each.
  * Enhanced "WHERE x NOT NULL" partial indexes so that they are
    usable if the "x" column appears in a LIKE or GLOB operator.
  * Enhanced sqlite3_interrupt() so that it interrupts checkpoint
    operations that are in process.
  * Enhanced the LIKE and GLOB matching algorithm to be faster for
    cases when the pattern contains multiple wildcards.

Mon Nov 21 21:50:08 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- SQLite 3.15.1:
  * Fix the VACUUM command so that it spills excess content to disk
    rather than holding everything in memory, and possible causing
    an out-of-memory error for larger database files

      prior to opening.
  * Enhance the fts5vocab virtual table to handle "ORDER BY term"
    efficiently.
  * Miscellaneous micro-optimizations reduce CPU usage by more than
    7% on common workloads. Most optimization in this release
    has been on the front-end (sqlite3_prepare_v2()).
  * The multiply operator now correctly detects 64-bit
    integer overflow and promotes to floating point in all
    corner-cases. Fix for ticket 1ec41379c9c1e400.
  * Correct handling of columns with redundant unique indexes
    when those columns are used on the LHS of an IN operator.

    it understands that its input is not interactive.
  * Correct affinity computations for a SELECT on the RHS of
    an IN operator. Fix for ticket 199df4168c.
  * The ORDER BY LIMIT optimization is not valid unless the
    inner-most IN operator loop is actually used by
    the query plan. Fix for ticket 0c4df46116e90f92.
  * Fix an internal code generator problem that was causing
    some DELETE operations to no-op. Ticket ef360601

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 14 07:26:23 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- SQLite 3.14.1:

Mon Aug  8 18:06:28 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- SQLite 3.14.0
  * Added support for WITHOUT ROWID virtual tables.
  * Improved the query planner so that the OR optimization can be
    used on virtual tables even if one or more of the disjuncts use
    the LIKE, GLOB, REGEXP, MATCH operators.
  * Added the CSV virtual table for reading RFC 4180 formatted
    comma-separated value files.
  * Added the carray() table-valued function extension.
  * Enabled persistent loadable extensions using the new
    SQLITE_OK_LOAD_PERMANENTLY return code from the extension
    entry point.
  * Added the SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_USED_SHARED option to
    sqlite3_db_status().
  * Add the vfsstat.c loadable extension - a VFS shim that measures
    I/O together with an eponymous virtual table that provides access
    to the measurements.
  * Improved algorithm for running queries with both an ORDER BY
    and a LIMIT where only the inner-most loop naturally generates
    rows in the correct order.
  * Enhancements to Lemon parser generator, so that it generates a
    faster parser.
  * The PRAGMA compile_options command now attempts to show the version
    number of the compiler that generated the library.
  * Enhance PRAGMA table_info so that it provides information about
    eponymous virtual tables.
  * The query planner uses a full scan of a partial index instead of
    a full scan of the main table, in cases where that makes sense.
  * Allow table-valued functions to appear on the right-hand side
    of an IN operator.
  * Added two new C-language interfaces: sqlite3_expanded_sql()
    and sqlite3_trace_v2(). These new interfaces subsume the
    functions of sqlite3_trace() and sqlite3_profile() which are
    now deprecated.
  * Added the json_quote() SQL function to the json1 extension.
  * Disable the authorizer callback while reparsing the schema.
  * Added the SQLITE_ENABLE_UNKNOWN_SQL_FUNCTION compile-time option and
    turned that option on by default when building the command-line shell.
  * Fix the ALTER TABLE command so that it does not corrupt descending
    indexes when adding a column to a legacy file format database.
    Ticket f68bf68513a1c15f
  * Fix a NULL-pointer dereference/crash that could occurs when a
    transitive WHERE clause references a non-existent collating
    sequence. Ticket e8d439c77685eca6.
  * Improved the cost estimation for an index scan which includes a WHERE
    clause that can be partially or fully evaluated using columns in the index
    and without having to do a table lookup. This fixes a performance regression
    that occurred for some obscure queries following the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization
    introduced in version 3.12.0.

  * Postpone I/O associated with TEMP files for as long as possible,
    with the hope that the I/O can ultimately be avoided completely.
  * Merged the session extension into trunk.
  * Added the ".auth ON|OFF" command to the command-line shell.
  * Added the "--indent" option to the ".schema" and ".fullschema"
    commands of the command-line shell, to turn on pretty-printing.
  * Added the ".eqp full" option to the command-line shell, that does
    both EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN on each statement that is
    evaluated.
  * Improved resistance against goofy query planner decisions caused by
    incomplete or incorrect modifications to the sqlite_stat1 table by
    the application.
  * Added the sqlite3_db_config(db,SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION)
    interface which allows the sqlite3_load_extension() C-API to be enabled
    while keeping the load_extension() SQL function disabled for security.
  * Change the temporary directory search algorithm on Unix to allow
    directories with write and execute permission, but without read
    permission, to serve as temporary directories. Apply this same
    standard to the "." fallback directory.
  * Fix a problem with the multi-row one-pass DELETE optimization that was
    causing it to compute incorrect answers with a self-referential subquery
    in the WHERE clause. Fix for ticket dc6ebeda9396087
  * Fix a possible segfault with DELETE when table is a rowid table with an
    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and the WHERE clause contains a OR and the table has
    one or more indexes that are able to trigger the OR optimization, but none
    of the indexes reference any table columns other than the
    INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. Ticket 16c9801ceba49.
  * When checking for the WHERE-clause push-down optimization, verify that all
    terms of the compound inner SELECT are non-aggregate, not just the last term.
    Fix for ticket f7f8c97e97597.

    drive an index on a LEFT OUTER JOIN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 07:47:34 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- SQLite 3.12.0:
  * The SQLITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE is increased from 1024 to 4096.
    The SQLITE_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE is changed from 2000 to -2000
    so the same amount of cache memory is used by default.
  * Enhancements to the Lemon parser generator so that it creates
    a smaller and faster SQL parser.
  * Only create master journal files if two or more attached databases
    are all modified, do not have PRAGMA synchronous set to OFF,
    and do not have the journal_mode set to OFF, MEMORY, or WAL.

    sqlite3_db_config() which allows the two-argument version of the
    fts3_tokenizer() SQL function to be enabled or disabled at run-time.
  * Added the sqlite3rbu_bp_progress() interface to the RBU extension.
  * The PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys=ON statement now also disables RESTRICT
    actions on foreign key.

  * Added the SQLITE_DEFAULT_SYNCHRONOUS and SQLITE_DEFAULT_WAL_SYNCHRONOUS
    compile-time options. The SQLITE_DEFAULT_SYNCHRONOUS compile-time option
    replaces the SQLITE_EXTRA_DURABLE option, which is no longer supported.
  * Enhanced the ".stats" command in the command-line shell to show more
    information about I/O performance obtained from /proc, when available.
  * Make sure the sqlite3_set_auxdata() values from multiple triggers within
    a single statement do not interfere with one another. Ticket dc9b1c91.
  * Fix the code generator for expressions of the form "x IN (SELECT...)"
    where the SELECT statement on the RHS is a correlated subquery.

	sqlite3_snapshot_free() interfaces. These are subject to change or removal in
	a subsequent release.
* Enhance the 'utc' modifier in the date and time functions so that it is a no-op 
	if the date/time is known to already be in UTC. (This is not a compatibility

	 extension.
* Added the SQLITE_LIKE_DOESNT_MATCH_BLOBS compile-time option.
* Many small performance optimizations.
+ Enhancements to the command-line shell:
 * Added the ".changes ON|OFF" and ".vfsinfo" dot-commands.

  * Added the SQLITE_ENABLE_API_ARMOR compile-time option.
  * Added the SQLITE_REVERSE_UNORDERED_SELECTS compile-time option.
  * Added the SQLITE_SORTER_PMASZ compile-time option and 
    SQLITE_CONFIG_PMASZ start-time option.
  * Added the SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE_HDRSZ option to sqlite3_config()
  * The number of rows in a VALUES clause is no longer limited by
    SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT.
  * Added the eval.c loadable extension that implements an eval()
    SQL function that will recursively evaluate SQL.
- Performance Enhancements:
  * Reduce the number of memcpy() operations involved in balancing a
    b-tree, for 3.2% overall performance boost.
  * Improvements to cost estimates for the skip-scan optimization.
  * The automatic indexing optimization is now capable of
    generating a partial index if that is appropriate.
- Bug fixes:
  * Ensure durability following a power loss with "PRAGMA
    journal_mode=TRUNCATE" by calling fsync() right after
    truncating the journal file.
  * The query planner now recognizes that any column in the right-
    hand table of a LEFT JOIN can be NULL, even if that column has
    a NOT NULL constraint. Avoid trying to optimize out NULL tests
    in those cases.
  * Make sure ORDER BY puts rows in ascending order even if the
    DISTINCT operator is implemented using a descending index.
  * Fix data races that might occur under stress when running with
    many threads in shared cache mode where some of the threads are
    opening and closing connections.
  * Fix obscure crash bugs found by american fuzzy lop.

- SQLite 3.8.7.4:
  * Bug fix: Add in a mutex that was omitted from the previous
    release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  6 17:21:43 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- SQLite 3.8.7.3:
  * Ensure the cached KeyInfo objects (an internal abstraction not
    visible to the application) do not go stale when operating in
    shared cache mode and frequently closing and reopening some
    database connections while leaving other database connections
    on the same shared cache open continuously.
  * Recognize that any column in the right-hand table of a LEFT
    JOIN can be NULL even if the column has a NOT NULL constraint.
    Do not apply optimizations that assume the column is never
    NULL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 19 00:00:00 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- SQLite 3.8.7.2:

    allowed to continue as long as the schema is unchanged.
  * Bug fix: Make sure that NULL results from OP_Column are fully
    and completely NULL and do not have the MEM_Ephem bit set.
  * Bug fix: The %c format in sqlite3_mprintf() is able to handle
    precisions greater than 70.
  * Bug fix: Do not automatically remove the DISTINCT keyword from
    a SELECT that forms the right-hand side of an IN operator since
    it is necessary if the SELECT also contains a LIMIT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 29 21:03:11 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- SQLite 3.8.7.1:

  * Fix an assertion fault that can occur when updating the NULL
    value of a field at the end of a table that was added using
    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN.
  * Do not attempt to use the strchrnul() function from the
    standard C library unless the HAVE_STRCHRNULL compile-time
    option is set.
  * Fix a couple of problems associated with running an UPDATE or
    DELETE on a VIEW with a rowid in the WHERE clause.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 17 19:45:26 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- SQLite 3.8.7
- Performance Enhancements:
  * Many micro-optimizations result in 20.3% more work for the same
    number of CPU cycles relative to the previous release.
  * The sorter can use auxiliary helper threads to increase real-
    time response. This feature is off by default and may be
    enabled using the PRAGMA threads command or the 
    SQLITE_DEFAULT_WORKER_THREADS compile-time option.
  * Enhance the skip-scan optimization so that it is able to skip
    index terms that occur in the middle of the index, not just as
    the left-hand side of the index.
  * Improved optimization of CAST operators.
  * Various improvements in how the query planner uses sqlite_stat4
    information to estimate plan costs.
- New Features:
  * Added new interfaces with 64-bit length parameters:
      sqlite3_malloc64()
      sqlite3_realloc64()
      sqlite3_bind_blob64()
      sqlite3_result_blob64()
      sqlite3_bind_text64()
      sqlite3_result_text64()
  * Added the new interface sqlite3_msize() that returns the size
    of a memory allocation obtained from sqlite3_malloc64() and its
    variants.
  * Added the SQLITE_LIMIT_WORKER_THREADS option to sqlite3_limit()
    and PRAGMA threads command for configuring the number of
    available worker threads.
  * The spellfix1 extension allows the application to optionally
    specify the rowid for each INSERT. Added the User
    Authentication extension.
- Bug Fixes:
  * Fix a bug in the partial index implementation that might result
    in an incorrect answer if a partial index is used in a subquery
    or in a view.
  * Fix a query planner bug that might cause a table to be scanned
    in the wrong direction (thus reversing the order of output)
    when a DESC index is used to implement the ORDER BY clause on a
    query that has an identical GROUP BY clause.
  * Fix a bug in sqlite3_trace() that was causing it to sometimes
    fail to print an SQL statement if that statement needed to be
    re-prepared.
  * Fix a faulty assert() statement.
- Test, Debug, and Analysis Changes:
  * Show ASCII-art abstract syntax tree diagrams using the
    ".selecttrace" and ".wheretrace" commands in the command-line
    shell when compiled with SQLITE_DEBUG,
    SQLITE_ENABLE_SELECTTRACE, and SQLITE_ENABLE_WHERETRACE.
    Also provide the sqlite3TreeViewExpr() and
    sqlite3TreeViewSelect() entry points that can be invoked
    from with the debugger to show the parse tree when stopped at
    a breakpoint.
  * Drop support for SQLITE_ENABLE_TREE_EXPLAIN. The SELECTTRACE
    mechanism provides more useful diagnostics information.
  * New options to the command-line shell for configuring auxiliary
    memory usage: --pagecache, --lookaside, and --scratch.

    command-line shell.
  * Added the .fullschema dot-command to the command-line shell.
  * performance enhancements
  * bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- SQlite 3.8.5
- New and improved:
  * Added support for partial sorting by index.
  * Enhance the query planner so that it always prefers an index
    that uses a superset of WHERE clause terms relative to some

    the index size for a full-text index that is subject to a large
    number of updates.
  * Added the sqlite3_rtree_query_callback() interface to R-Tree
    extension
  * Added new URI query parameters "nolock" and "immutable".

    read-only database connections.
  * Enable the OR optimization for WITHOUT ROWID tables.
  * Render expressions of the form "x IN (?)" (with a single value

    they where "x==?", Similarly optimize "x NOT IN (?)"
  * Add the ".system" and ".once" commands to the command-line shell
  * Added the SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE bit to the set of bits that
    can be returned by the xDeviceCharacteristics method of a VFS.

  * Assertion fault on queries involving expressions of the form
    "x IN (?)".
  * Incorrect column datatype reported.
  * Duplicate row returned on a query against a table with more than
    16 indices, each on a separate column, and all used via OR-
    connected constraints.
  * Partial index causes assertion fault on UPDATE OR REPLACE.
  * Crash when calling undocumented SQL function 
    sqlite_rename_parent() with NULL parameters.
  * ORDER BY ignored if the query has an identical GROUP BY.
  * The group_concat(x,'') SQL function returns NULL instead of an
    empty string when all inputs are empty strings.
  * Fix a bug in the VDBE code generator that caused crashes when
    doing an INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement where the number of
    columns being inserted is larger than the number of columns in
    the destination table.
  * Fix a problem in CSV import in the command-line shell where if
    the leftmost field of the first row in the CSV file was both
    zero bytes in size and unquoted no data would be imported.
  * Fix a problem in FTS4 where the left-most column that contained
    the notindexed column name as a prefix was not indexed rather
    than the column whose name matched exactly.
  * Fix the sqlite3_db_readonly() interface so that it returns
    true if the database is read-only due to the file format write
    version number being too large.

- SQLite 3.8.4
- general changes:
  * Code optimization and refactoring for improved performance.
  * Add the ".clone" and ".save" commands to the command-line shell.
  * Update the banner on the command-line shell to alert novice
    users when they are using an ephemeral in-memory database.

  * Change the datatype of SrcList.nSrc from type u8 to type int to
    work around an issue in the C compiler on AIX.
- bug fixes:
  * Bug fix: Fix the char() SQL function so that it returns an empty
    string rather than an "out of memory" error when called with
    zero arguments.
  * Bug fix: DISTINCT now recognizes that a zeroblob and a blob of
    all 0x00 bytes are the same thing.
  * Bug fix: Compute the correct answer for queries that contain an
    IS NOT NULL term in the WHERE clause and also contain an OR term
    in the WHERE clause and are compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4.
  * Bug fix: Make sure "rowid" columns are correctly resolved in
    joins between normal tables and WITHOUT ROWID tables.
  * Bug fix: Make sure the same temporary registers are not used

    clause.
  * Added the printf() SQL function.
  * Added SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC as an optional bit in the 4th

    interfaces, providing applications with the ability to create
    new functions that can be factored out of inner loops when
    they have constant arguments.
  * Add SQLITE_READONLY_DBMOVED error code, returned at the
    beginning of a transaction, to indicate that the underlying
    database file has been renamed or moved out from under SQLite.

- update to 3.8.2:
- adds support for WITHOUT ROWID tables
  http://sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html
- potentially incompatible change: cast from very large positive
  floating point number no longer results in most negavtive number,
  now casts from float to integers return integer closest to float

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 26 10:33:58 UTC 2013 - max@suse.com

- New version 3.7.17.
- Full list of changes: http://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_7_17.html
- Highlights:
  * Add support for memory-mapped I/O.
  * Assigned the integer at offset 68 in the database header as
    the Application ID for when SQLite is used as an application
    file-format. Added the PRAGMA application_id command to query
    and set the Application ID.
  * Enhance the extension loading mechanism to be more flexible
    (while still maintaining backwards compatibility) in two ways:
    1. If the default entry point "sqlite3_extension_init" is not
       present in the loadable extension, also try an entry point
       "sqlite3_X_init" where "X" is based on the shared library
       filename. This allows every extension to have a different
       entry point, which allows them to be statically linked with
       no code changes.
    2. The shared library filename passed to
       sqlite3_load_extension() may omit the filename suffix, and
       an appropriate architecture-dependent suffix (".so",
       ".dylib", or ".dll") will be added automatically.
  * Added many new loadable extensions to the source tree,
    including amatch, closure, fuzzer, ieee754, nextchar, regexp,
    spellfix, and wholenumber.
  * Bug fix: Fix a potential database corruption bug in shared
    cache mode when one database connection is closed while
    another is in the middle of a write transaction. Ticket

Wed Mar 20 12:09:38 UTC 2013 - max@suse.com

- New Version 3.7.16:
  * Added the PRAGMA foreign_key_check command.
  * Added new extended error codes for all SQLITE_CONSTRAINT
    errors
  * Added the SQLITE_READONLY_ROLLBACK extended error code for
    when a database cannot be opened because it needs rollback
    recovery but is read-only.
  * Added SQL functions unicode(A) and char(X1,...,XN).
  * Performance improvements for PRAGMA incremental_vacuum,
    especially in cases where the number of free pages is greater
    than what will fit on a single trunk page of the freelist.
  * Improved optimization of queries containing aggregate min() or
    max().
  * Enhance virtual tables so that they can potentially use an
    index when the WHERE clause contains the IN operator.
  * Allow indices to be used for sorting even if prior terms of
    the index are constrained by IN operators in the WHERE clause.
  * Enhance the PRAGMA table_info command so that the "pk" column
    is an increasing integer to show the order of columns in the
    primary key.

    constraints.
  * Performance improvements in the query optimizer.
  * Allow the error message from PRAGMA integrity_check to be
    longer than 20000 bytes.

  * Added the test_regexp.c module as a demonstration of how to
    implement the REGEXP operator.
  * Improved error messages in the RTREE extension.
  * Enhance the command-line shell so that a non-zero argument to
    the ".exit" command causes the shell to exit immediately
    without cleanly shutting down the database connection.
  * Improved error messages for invalid boolean arguments to
    dot-commands in the command-line shell.
  * Improved error messages for "foreign key mismatch" showing the
    names of the two tables involved.
  * Remove all uses of umask() in the unix VFS.
  * Added the PRAGMA vdbe_addoptrace and PRAGMA vdbe_debug
    commands.
  * Change to use strncmp() or the equivalent instead of memcmp()
    when comparing non-zero-terminated strings.
  * Update cygwin interfaces to omit deprecated API calls.
  * Enhance the spellfix1 extension so that the edit distance cost
    table can be changed at runtime by inserting a string like
    'edit_cost_table=TABLE' into the "command" field.
  * Bug fix: repair a long-standing problem that could cause
    incorrect query results in a 3-way or larger join that
    compared INTEGER fields against TEXT fields in two or more
    places. Ticket fc7bd6358f
  * Bug fix: Issue an error message if the 16-bit reference
    counter on a view overflows due to an overly complex query.
  * Bug fix: Avoid leaking memory on LIMIT and OFFSET clauses in
    deeply nested UNION ALL queries.
  * Bug fix: Make sure the schema is up-to-date prior to running
    pragmas table_info, index_list, index_info, and
    foreign_key_list.

    when a statement is automatically reprepared due to
    SQLITE_SCHEMA errors.
  * Enhance IN operator processing to make use of indices with
    numeric affinities.
  * Do full-table scans using covering indices when possible,
    under the theory that an index will be smaller and hence can
    be scanned with less I/O.
  * Enhance the query optimizer so that ORDER BY clauses are more
    aggressively optimized, especially in joins where various
    terms of the ORDER BY clause come from separate tables of the
    join.
  * Add the ability to implement FROM clause subqueries as
    coroutines rather that manifesting the subquery into a
    temporary table.
  * Several enhancements the command-line shell.
  * Added the busy_timeout pragma.
  * Added the instr() SQL function.
  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER file control, used to allow
    VFS implementations to get access to the busy handler

    mode.
  * Bug fix: Avoid a deadlock or crash if the backup API, shared
    cache, and the SQLite Encryption Extension are all used at
    once.

    reconstructing a database from the output of the ".dump" 
    command of the command-line shell.
  * Added the sqlite3_close_v2() interface.
  * Updated the command-line shell so that it can be built using 
    SQLITE_OMIT_FLOATING_POINT and SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT.
  * Enhancements to PRAGMA integrity_check and PRAGMA quick_check 
    so that they can optionally check just a single attached 
    database install of all attached databases.
  * Enhancements to WAL mode processing that ensure that at least 
    one valid read-mark is available at all times, so that 
    read-only processes can always read the database.

  * Added the SQLITE_DISABLE_FTS4_DEFERRED compile-time option.
  * Better handling of aggregate queries where the aggregate 
    functions are contained within subqueries.

    covering index on queries that make use of or optimization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 31 15:41:54 UTC 2012 - max@suse.com

- New version 3.7.13:
  * In-memory databases that are specified using URI filenames are
    allowed to use shared cache, so that the same in-memory
    database can be accessed from multiple database connections.
  * Recognize and use the mode=memory query parameter in URI
    filenames.
  * Avoid resetting the schema of shared cache connections when
    any one connection closes. Instead, wait for the last
    connection to close before reseting the schema.
  * In the RTREE extension, when rounding 64-bit floating point
    numbers to 32-bit for storage, always round in a direction
    that causes the bounding box to get larger.
  * Adjust the unix driver to avoid unnecessary calls to fchown().
  * Add interfaces sqlite3_quota_ferror() and
    sqlite3_quota_file_available() to the test_quota.c module.
  * The sqlite3_create_module() and sqlite3_create_module_v2()
    interfaces return SQLITE_MISUSE on any attempt to overload or
    replace a virtual table module. The destructor is always
    called in this case, in accordance with historical and current
    documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 24 07:39:26 UTC 2012 - max@suse.com

- New version 3.7.12:
  * Add the SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_WRITE option for
    sqlite3_db_status().
  * Optimize the typeof() and length() SQL functions so that they
    avoid unnecessary reading of database content from disk.
  * Add the FTS4 "merge" command, the FTS4 "automerge" command,
    and the FTS4 "integrity-check" command.
  * Report the name of specific CHECK constraints that fail.
  * In the command-line shell, use popen() instead of fopen() if
    the first character of the argument to the ".output" command
    is "|".
  * Make use of OVERLAPPED in the windows VFS to avoid some system
    calls and thereby obtain a performance improvement.
  * More aggressive optimization of the AND operator when one side
    or the other is always false.
  * Improved performance of queries with many OR-connected terms
    in the WHERE clause that can all be indexed.
  * Add the SQLITE_RTREE_INT_ONLY compile-time option to force the
    R*Tree Extension Module to use integer instead of floating
    point values for both storage and computation.
  * Enhance the PRAGMA integrity_check command to use much less
    memory when processing multi-gigabyte databases.
  * New interfaces added to the test_quota.c add-on module.
  * Added the ".trace" dot-command to the command-line shell.
  * Allow virtual table constructors to be invoked recursively.
  * Improved optimization of ORDER BY clauses on compound queries.
  * Improved optimization of aggregate subqueries contained within
    an aggregate query.
  * Bug fix: Fix the RELEASE command so that it does not cancel
    pending queries. This repairs a problem introduced in 3.7.11.
  * Bug fix: Do not discard the DISTINCT as superfluous unless a
    subset of the result set is subject to a UNIQUE constraint and
    it none of the columns in that subset can be NULL. Ticket
    385a5b56b9.
  * Bug fix: Do not optimize away an ORDER BY clause that has the
    same terms as a UNIQUE index unless those terms are also NOT
    NULL. Ticket 2a5629202f.
- 79a4a3a84f.patch isn't needed anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 09:53:58 UTC 2012 - idonmez@suse.com

- Add upstream commit 79a4a3a84f to fix subversion failures 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 06:49:49 UTC 2012 - max@suse.com

- Spec file cleanup
- Drop support for the pre 11.0 packaging scheme.
- New version 3.7.11. Changes since 3.7.8 include:
  * Enhance the INSERT syntax to allow multiple rows to be inserted
    via the VALUES clause.
  * Enhance the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE command to support the IF NOT
    EXISTS clause.
  * Added the sqlite3_stricmp() interface as a counterpart to
    sqlite3_strnicmp().
  * Added the sqlite3_db_readonly() interface.
  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA file control, giving VFS
    implementations the ability to add new PRAGMA statements or to
    override built-in PRAGMAs.
  * Queries of the form: "SELECT max(x), y FROM table" returns the
    value of y on the same row that contains the maximum x value.
  * Added support for the FTS4 languageid option.
  * Documented support for the FTS4 content option. This feature
    has actually been in the code since version 3.7.9 but is only
    now considered to be officially supported.
  * Pending statements no longer block ROLLBACK. Instead, the
    pending statement will return SQLITE_ABORT upon next access
    after the ROLLBACK.
  * Improvements to the handling of CSV inputs in the command-line
    shell
  * The default schema format number is changed from 1 to 4. This
    means that, unless the PRAGMA legacy_file_format=ON statement
    is run, newly created database files will be unreadable by
    version of SQLite prior to 3.3.0 (2006-01-10). It also means
    that the descending indices are enabled by default.
  * The sqlite3_pcache_methods structure and the
    SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE and SQLITE_CONFIG_GETPCACHE configuration
    parameters are deprecated. They are replaced by a new
    sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure and SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2 and
    SQLITE_CONFIG_GETPCACHE2 configuration parameters.
  * Added the powersafe overwrite property to the VFS
    interface. Provide the SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE I/O
    capability, the SQLITE_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE compile-time option,
    and the "psow=BOOLEAN" query parameter for URI filenames.
  * Added the sqlite3_db_release_memory() interface and the
    shrink_memory pragma.
  * Added the sqlite3_db_filename() interface.
  * Added the sqlite3_stmt_busy() interface.
  * Added the sqlite3_uri_boolean() and sqlite3_uri_int64()
    interfaces.
  * If the argument to PRAGMA cache_size is negative N, that means
    to use approximately -1024*N bytes of memory for the page cache
    regardless of the page size.
  * Enhanced the default memory allocator to make use of _msize()
    on windows, malloc_size() on Mac, and malloc_usable_size() on
    Linux.
  * Enhanced the query planner to support index queries with range
    constraints on the rowid.
  * Enhanced the query planner flattening logic to allow UNION ALL
    compounds to be promoted upwards to replace a simple wrapper
    SELECT even if the compounds are joins.
  * Enhanced the query planner so that the xfer optimization can be
    used with INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT as long as the
    destination table is initially empty.
  * Enhanced the windows VFS so that all system calls can be
    overridden using the xSetSystemCall interface.
  * Updated the "unix-dotfile" VFS to use locking directories with
    mkdir() and rmdir() instead of locking files with open() and
    unlink().
  * Enhancements to the test_quota.c extension to support
    stdio-like interfaces with quotas.
  * Change the unix VFS to be tolerant of read() system calls that
    return less then the full number of requested bytes.
  * Change both unix and windows VFSes to report a sector size of
    4096 instead of the old default of 512.
  * In the TCL Interface, add the -uri option to the "sqlite3" TCL
    command used for creating new database connection objects.
  * Added the SQLITE_TESTCTRL_EXPLAIN_STMT test-control option with
    the SQLITE_ENABLE_TREE_EXPLAIN compile-time option to enable
    the command-line shell to display ASCII-art parse trees of SQL
    statements that it processes, for debugging and analysis.
  * Bug fix: Add an additional xSync when restarting a WAL in order
    to prevent an exceedingly unlikely but theoretically possible
    database corruption following power-loss. Ticket ff5be73dee.
  * Bug fix: Change the VDBE so that all registers are initialized
    to Invalid instead of NULL. Ticket 7bbfb7d442
  * Bug fix: Fix problems that can result from 32-bit integer
    overflow. Ticket ac00f496b7e2
  * If a search token (on the right-hand side of the MATCH
    operator) in FTS4 begins with "^" then that token must be the
    first in its field of the document. ** Potentially Incompatible
    Change **
  * Added options SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_HIT and
    SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_MISS to the sqlite3_db_status()
    interface.
  * Removed support for SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2, replacing it with the
    much more capable SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3 option.
  * Enhancements to the sqlite3_analyzer utility program, including
    the --pageinfo and --stats options and support for multiplexed
    databases.
  * Enhance the sqlite3_data_count() interface so that it can be
    used to determine if SQLITE_DONE has been seen on the prepared
    statement.
  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE file-control by which the
    SQLite core indicates to the VFS that the current transaction
    will overwrite the entire database file.
  * Increase the default lookaside memory allocator allocation size
    from 100 to 128 bytes.
  * Enhanced the query planner so that it can factor terms in and
    out of OR expressions in the WHERE clause in an effort to find
    better indices.
  * Added the SQLITE_DIRECT_OVERFLOW_READ compile-time option,
    causing overflow pages to be read directly from the database
    file, bypassing the page cache.
  * Remove limits on the magnitude of precision and width value in
    the format specifiers of the sqlite3_mprintf() family of string
    rendering routines.
  * Fix a bug that prevent ALTER TABLE ... RENAME from working on
    some virtual tables in a database with a UTF16 encoding.
  * Fix a bug in ASCII-to-float conversion that causes slow
    performance and incorrect results when converting numbers with
    ridiculously large exponents.
  * Fix a bug that causes incorrect results in aggregate queries
    that use multiple aggregate functions whose arguments contain
    complicated expressions that differ only in the case of string
  * literals contained within those expressions.
  * Fix a bug that prevented the page_count and quick_check pragmas
    from working correctly if their names were capitalized.
  * Fix a bug that caused VACUUM to fail if the count_changes
    pragma was engaged.
  * Fix a bug in virtual table implementation that causes a crash
    if an FTS4 table is dropped inside a transaction and a
    SAVEPOINT occurs afterwards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  4 13:56:02 UTC 2011 - idonmez@novell.com

- New Version: 3.7.7.1:
  * Fix a bug causing PRAGMA case_sensitive_like statements compiled
    using sqlite3_prepare() to fail with an SQLITE_SCHEMA error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 12:32:50 UTC 2011 - max@novell.com

- New Version: 3.7.7:
  * Add support for URI filenames.
  * Add the sqlite3_vtab_config() interface in support of
    ON CONFLICT clauses with virtual tables.
  * Add the xSavepoint, xRelease and xRollbackTo methods in
    virtual tables in support of SAVEPOINT for virtual tables.
  * Update the built-in FTS3/FTS4 and RTREE virtual tables to
    support ON CONFLICT clauses and REPLACE.
  * Avoid unnecessary reparsing of the database schema.
  * Added support for the FTS4 prefix option and the FTS4 order
    option.
  * Allow WAL-mode databases to be opened read-only as long as
    there is an existing read/write connection.
  * Added support for short filenames.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 20 08:38:22 UTC 2011 - max@novell.com

- New Version: 3.7.6.3:
  * Fix a problem with WAL mode which could cause transactions to
    silently rollback if the cache_size is set very small (less than
    10) and SQLite comes under memory pressure.
- Enabled the column metadata APIs (bnc#383370).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 16:02:10 UTC 2011 - max@novell.com

- New Version: 3.7.6.1:
  * Added the sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2() interface and enhanced
    the wal_checkpoint pragma to support blocking checkpoints.
  * Improvements to the query planner so that it makes better
    estimates of plan costs and hence does a better job of
    choosing the right plan, especially when SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2
    is used.
  * Fix a bug which prevented deferred foreign key constraints
    from being enforced when sqlite3_finalize() was not called
    by one statement with a failed foreign key constraint prior
    to another statement with foreign key constraints running.
  * Integer arithmetic operations that would have resulted in
    overflow are now performed using floating-point instead.
  * Increased the version number on the VFS object to 3 and added
    new methods xSetSysCall, xGetSysCall, and xNextSysCall used
    for doing full-coverage testing.
  * Increase the maximum value of SQLITE_MAX_ATTACHED from 30 to
    62 (though the default value remains at 10).
  * Added the fts4aux table
  * Added support for compressed FTS4 content 
  * Enhance the ANALYZE command to support the name of an index as
    its argument, in order to analyze just that one index.
  * Added the "unix-excl" built-in VFS on unix and unix-like
    platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  3 14:52:19 UTC 2011 - max@novell.com

- New Version: 3.7.5:
  * Added the sqlite3_vsnprintf() interface.
  * Added the SQLITE_DBSTATUS_LOOKASIDE_HIT,
    SQLITE_DBSTATUS_LOOKASIDE_MISS_SIZE, and
    SQLITE_DBSTATUS_LOOKASIDE_MISS_FULL options for the
    sqlite3_db_status() interface.
  * Added the SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET compile-time option.
  * Added the SQLITE_DEFAULT_FOREIGN_KEYS compile-time option.
  * Updates to sqlite3_stmt_readonly() so that its result is
    well-defined for all prepared statements and so that it works
    with VACUUM.
  * Added the "-heap" option to the command-line shell
  * Fix a bug involving frequent changes in and out of WAL mode
    and VACUUM that could (in theory) cause database corruption.
  * Enhance the sqlite3_trace() mechanism so that nested SQL
    statements such as might be generated by virtual tables are
    shown but are shown in comments and without parameter
    expansion. This greatly improves tracing output when using the
    FTS3/4 and/or RTREE virtual tables.
  * Change the xFileControl() methods on all built-in VFSes to
    return SQLITE_NOTFOUND instead of SQLITE_ERROR for an
    unrecognized operation code.
  * The SQLite core invokes the SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED file
    control to the VFS in place of a call to xSync if the database
    has PRAGMA synchronous set to OFF.

- Split off sqlite3-tcl into a separate source package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 13 14:08:55 UTC 2011 - max@novell.com

- Adjust the package to the new upstream tarball naming and
  version numbering scheme.

- New version: 3.7.4:
  * Added the sqlite3_blob_reopen() interface to allow an
    existing sqlite3_blob object to be rebound to a new row.
  * Use the new sqlite3_blob_reopen() interface to improve the
    performance of FTS.
  * VFSes that do not support shared memory are allowed to access
    WAL databases if PRAGMA locking_mode is set to EXCLUSIVE.
  * Enhancements to EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN.
  * Added the sqlite3_stmt_readonly() interface.
  * Added PRAGMA checkpoint_fullfsync.
  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER option to
    sqlite3_file_control().
  * Added support for FTS4 and enhancements to the FTS matchinfo()
    function.
  * Added the test_superlock.c module which provides example code
    for obtaining an exclusive lock to a rollback or WAL database.
  * Added the test_multiplex.c module which provides an example
    VFS that provides multiplexing (sharding) of a DB, splitting
    it over multiple files of fixed size.
  * A very obscure bug associated with the or optimization was
    fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 17:06:54 UTC 2010 - max@novell.com

- New version: 3.7.3:
  * Added the sqlite3_create_function_v2() interface that
    includes a destructor callback.
  * Added support for custom r-tree queries using
    application-supplied callback routines to define the boundary
    of the query region.
  * The default page cache strives more diligently to avoid using
    memory beyond what is allocated to it by
    SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE. Or if using page cache is allocating
    from the heap, it strives to avoid going over the
    sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64(), even if
    SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT is not set.
  * Added the sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() interface as a
    replacement for sqlite3_soft_heap_limit().
  * The ANALYZE command now gathers statistics on tables even if
    they have no indices.
  * Tweaks to the query planner to help it do a better job of
    finding the most efficient query plan for each query.
  * Enhanced the internal text-to-numeric conversion routines so
    that they work with UTF8 or UTF16, thereby avoiding some
    UTF16-to-UTF8 text conversions.
  * Fix a problem that was causing excess memory usage with large
    WAL transactions in win32 systems.
  * The interface between the VDBE and B-Tree layer is enhanced
    such that the VDBE provides hints to the B-Tree layer letting
    the B-Tree layer know when it is safe to use hashing instead
    of B-Trees for transient tables.
  * Miscellaneous documentation enhancements. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 10:42:55 UTC 2010 - max@novell.com

- New version: 3.7.2:
  * Added new commands SQLITE_DBSTATUS_SCHEMA_USED and
    SQLITE_DBSTATUS_STMT_USED to the sqlite3_db_status()
    interface, in order to report out the amount of memory used
    to hold the schema and prepared statements of a connection.
 
  * Increase the maximum size of a database pages from 32KiB to
    64KiB.

  * Use the LIKE optimization even if the right-hand side string
    contains no wildcards.

  * Added the SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE verb to the
    sqlite3_file_control() interface for both unix and windows, to
    cause database files to grow in large chunks in order to reduce
    disk fragmentation.

  * Fixed a bug in the query planner that caused performance
    regresssions relative to 3.6.23.1 on some complex joins.

  * Fixed a typo in the OS/2 backend.

  * Refactored the pager module.

  * The SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_SIZE compile-time option is now silently
    ignored. The maximum page size is hard-coded at 65536 bytes.

  * Fix an old and very obscure bug that can lead to corruption of
    the database free-page list when incremental_vacuum is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  5 12:20:40 CEST 2010 - max@suse.de

- New version 3.7.0.1:
  * Fix a potential database corruption problem that can result
    if the same database file is alternately written by version
    3.7.0 and 3.6.23.1.
  * Fix a possible performance regression caused by the
    introduction of automatic indexing. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 22 19:08:56 CEST 2010 - max@suse.de

- New version: 3.7.0:
  * Added support for write-ahead logging.
  * Query planner enhancement - automatic transient indices are
    created when doing so reduces the estimated query time.
  * Query planner enhancement - the ORDER BY becomes a no-op if
    the query also contains a GROUP BY clause that forces the
    correct output order.
  * Add the SQLITE_DBSTATUS_CACHE_USED verb for
    sqlite3_db_status().
  * The logical database size is now stored in the database
    header so that bytes can be appended to the end of the
    database file without corrupting it and so that SQLite will
    work correctly on systems that lack support for ftruncate(). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  5 09:32:28 CEST 2010 - max@suse.de

- Bugfix release: 3.6.23.1
  * Fix a bug in the offsets() function of FTS3.
  * Fix a missing "sync" that when omitted could lead to database
    corruption if a power failure or OS crash occurred just as a
    ROLLBACK operation was finishing.

- Version 3.6.23:
  * Added the secure_delete pragma.

  * Added the sqlite3_compileoption_used() and
    sqlite3_compileoption_get() interfaces as well as the
    compile_options pragma and the sqlite_compileoption_used() and
    sqlite_compileoption_get() SQL functions.

  * Added the sqlite3_log() interface together with the
    SQLITE_CONFIG_LOG verb to sqlite3_config(). The ".log" command
    is added to the Command Line Interface.

  * Improvements to FTS3.

  * Improvements and bug-fixes in support for
    SQLITE_OMIT_FLOATING_POINT.

  * The integrity_check pragma is enhanced to detect out-of-order
    rowids.

  * The ".genfkey" operator has been removed from the Command Line
    Interface.

  * Updates to the co-hosted Lemon LALR(1) parser
    generator. (These updates did not effect SQLite.)

  * Various minor bug fixes and performance enhancements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 14 17:04:48 UTC 2010 - max@novell.com

- New version: 3.6.22:
  * Fix bugs that can (rarely) lead to incorrect query results
    when the CAST or OR operators are used in the WHERE clause of
    a query.
  * Continuing enhancements and improvements to FTS3.
  * The SQL output resulting from sqlite3_trace() is now modified
    to include the values of bound parameters.
  * Performance optimizations targetting a specific use case from
    a single high-profile user of SQLite. A 12% reduction in the
    number of CPU operations is achieved (as measured by
    valgrind). Actual performance improvements in practice may
    vary depending on workload. Changes include:
    * The ifnull() and coalesce() SQL functions are now
      implemented using in-line VDBE code rather than calling
      external functions, so that unused arguments need never be
      evaluated.
    * The substr() SQL function does not bother to measure the
      length its entire input string if it is only computing a
      prefix.
    * Unnecessary OP_IsNull, OP_Affinity, and OP_MustBeInt VDBE
      opcodes are suppressed.
    * Various code refactorizations for performance.
  * The FTS3 extension has undergone a major rework and
    cleanup. New FTS3 documentation is now available.
  * The SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE compile-time option fixed to make
    sure that content is deleted even when the truncate
    optimization applies.
  * Improvements to "dot-command" handling in the Command Line
    Interface.
  * Other minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements.

    that  they use less memory on embedded platforms.
  * Reduce the amount of stack space used
  * The sqlite3_create_function() family of interfaces now return
    SQLITE_MISUSE instead of SQLITE_ERROR when passed invalid
    parameter combinations.
  * When new tables are created using CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT
    ... the datatype of the columns is the simplified SQLite
    datatype (TEXT, INT, REAL, NUMERIC, or BLOB) instead of a
    copy of the original datatype from the source table.
  * Resolve race conditions when checking for a hot rollback
    journal.
  * The sqlite3_shutdown() interface frees all mutexes under
    windows.
  * Enhanced robustness against corrupt database files
  * Continuing improvements to the test suite and fixes to
    obscure bugs and inconsistencies that the test suite
    improvements are uncovering. 
  * Other minor bug fixes and performance optimizations.

    by the prior versoin.
  * Other minor bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 10 14:32:18 CEST 2008 - max@suse.de

- Update to version 3.6.2.
- This version contains rewrites of the page-cache subsystem and
  the procedures for matching identifiers to table columns in SQL
  statements. These changes are designed to better modularize the
  code and make it more maintainable and reliable moving forward.
  Nearly 5000 non-comment lines of core code (about 11.3%) have
  changed from the previous release. Nevertheless, there should
  be no application-visible changes, other than bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 25 13:30:50 CEST 2008 - max@suse.de

- Update to version 3.6.0:
  * Modifications to the virtual file system interface to support a
    wider range of embedded systems. See 35to36.html for additional
    information. *** Potentially incompatible change ***
  * The handling of IN and NOT IN operators that contain a NULL on
    their right-hand side expression is brought into compliance with
    the SQL standard and with other SQL database engines. This is a
    bug fix, but as it has the potential to break legacy applications
    that depend on the older buggy behavior, we mark that as a
    *** Potentially incompatible change ***
  * The result column names generated for compound subqueries have
    been simplified to show only the name of the column of the
    original table and omit the table name. This makes SQLite
    operate more like other SQL database engines.
  * Added the sqlite3_config() interface for doing run-time
    configuration of the entire SQLite library.
  * Added the sqlite3_status() interface used for querying run-time
    status information about the overall SQLite library and its
    subsystems.
  * Added the sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown() interfaces.
  * The SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX option was added to sqlite3_open_v2().
  * Added the PRAGMA page_count command.
  * Added the sqlite3_next_stmt() interface.
  * Added a new R*Tree virtual table
- Link libtclsqlite against the Tcl stubs library, so that it can be
  used from tclkit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  8 15:03:21 CEST 2008 - max@suse.de

- Actually apply sqlite-strcasecmp.patch to fix the Tcl extension.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 10 16:04:31 CEST 2008 - max@suse.de

- update to version 3.5.7. Changes include:
  * Fix a bug in the register allocation for compound selects.
  * Do not apply the flattening optimization if the outer query
    is an aggregate and the inner query contains ORDER BY.
  * Accept "Z" as the zulu timezone at the end of date strings.
  * Fix a bug in the LIKE optimizer that occurs when the last
    character before the first wildcard is an upper-case "Z"
  * Added the "bitvec" object for keeping track of which pages
    have been journalled. Improves speed and reduces memory
    consumption, especially for large database files.
  * Add the new sqlite3_result_error_code() API.
  * Convert the underlying virtual machine to be a register-based
    machine rather than a stack-based machine. The only
    user-visible change is in the output of EXPLAIN.
- Fix build for Tcl 8.5.
- Don't --enable-releasemode anymore, because it recently started
  putting the package version into the library name
  (libsqlite3-3.5.7.so.0.8.6)  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 18 10:14:31 CET 2007 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 3.5.4
  From official changelog:
  * Fix a critical bug in UPDATE or DELETE that occurs when an
    OR REPLACE clause or a trigger causes rows in the same table to be
    deleted as side effects. (See ticket #2832.) The most likely result
    of this bug is a segmentation fault, though database corruption is
    a possibility.
  * Bring the processing of ORDER BY into compliance with the SQL
    standard for case where a result alias and a table column name are
    in conflict. Correct behavior is to prefer the result alias. Older
    versions of SQLite incorrectly picked the table column. (See ticket #2822.)
  * The VACUUM command preserves the setting of the legacy_file_format
    pragma. (Ticket #2804.)
  * Productize and officially support the group_concat() SQL function.
  * Better optimization of some IN operator expressions.
  * Add the ability to change the auto_vacuum status of a database by
    setting the auto_vaccum pragma and VACUUMing the database.
  * Prefix search in FTS3 is much more efficient.
  * Relax the SQL statement length restriction in the CLI so that the
    ".dump" output of databases with very large BLOBs and strings can
    be played back to recreate the database.
  * Other small bug fixes and optimizations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 30 08:51:31 CET 2007 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 3.5.3
  * documentation has been removed from tar ball.

  From official changelog:
  * Fix a long-standing bug in INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... statements 
    where the SELECT is compound. 
  * Fix a long-standing bug in RAISE(IGNORE) as used in BEFORE triggers. 
  * Fixed the operator precedence for the ~ operator. 
  * Allow collating sequence names to be quoted. 
  * Modify the TCL interface to use sqlite3_prepare_v2(). 
  * Fix multiple bugs that can occur following a malloc() failure. 
  * sqlite3_step() returns SQLITE_MISUSE instead of crashing when
    called with a NULL parameter. 
  * FTS3 now uses the SQLite memory allocator exclusively. The FTS3
    amalgamation can now be appended to the SQLite amalgamation to
    generate a super-amalgamation containing both. 
  * The DISTINCT keyword now will sometimes use an INDEX if an
    appropriate index is available and the optimizer thinks its use
     might be advantageous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  5 09:40:03 CET 2007 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 3.5.2
  From the official changelog:
  * The OS interface layer and the memory allocation subsystems in 
    SQLite have been reimplemented. The published API is largely 
    unchanged but the (unpublished) OS interface has been modified 
    extensively. Applications that implement their own OS interface 
    will require modification.
  * This is a large change. Approximately 10% of the source code was 
    modified.
  * Fix a long-standing bug that might cause database corruption if
    a disk-full error occurs in the middle of a transaction and that
    transaction is not rolled back.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 19:05:22 CEST 2007 - sbrabec@suse.cz

- update to version 3.4.1
  * Bugfix release to solve database corruption
  * remove static fts2 plugin patch, it is broken and get not used
  * Changelog from the release:
    - Fix a bug in VACUUM that can lead to  database corruption if two
      processes are connected to the database at the same time and one
      VACUUMs then the other then modifies the database.
    - The expression "+column" is now considered the same as "column" when
      computing the collating sequence to use on the expression.
    - In the TCL language interface, "@variable" instead of "$variable" always
      binds as a blob.
    - Added PRAGMA freelist_count for determining the current size of the
      freelist.
    - The  PRAGMA auto_vacuum=incremental setting is now persistent.
    - Add FD_CLOEXEC to all open files under unix.
    - Fix a bug in the  min()/max() optimization when applied to descending
      indices.
    - Make sure the TCL language interface works correctly with 64-bit integers
      on 64-bit machines.
    - Allow the value -9223372036854775808 as an integer literal in SQL
      statements.
    - Add the capability of "hidden" columns in virtual tables.
    - Use the macro SQLITE_PRIVATE (defaulting to "static") on all internal
      functions in the amalgamation.
    - Add pluggable tokenizers and ICU tokenization support to FTS2
    - Other minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements

    experimental pending additional testing.
  * Allow up to 64 tables in a join - the old limit was 32.
  * Added two new experimental functions: randomBlob() and hex().
    Their intended use is to facilitate generating UUIDs.

    results for updates on tables with triggers
  * Fix a bug in the ORDER BY clause optimizer for joins where
    the left-most table in the join is constrained by a UNIQUE index.
