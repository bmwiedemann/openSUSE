- Update to version 2.4
  * Added a Dutch translation contributed by Heimen Stoffels.
  * Made it so that the player starts at the same part of the screen in Classic difficulty as in version 1.1 (which is in the top-left quadrant rather than in the center).
  * Made it so that critical shield (that is, when you have only 1 shield left) causes more smoke particles to be generated.
  * Fixed a bug where Kline could continue circling while running away, causing him to flee diagonally at a rather slow speed (and also allowing you to kill him pretty easily).
  * Fixed a bug which caused music to not get installed properly (it was being installed in the sound directory instead of the music directory).
  * Made the Venus mission start in the same way as version 1.1 in Classic difficulty (albeit with a shorter delay, since the dialog is shorter than it was in version 1.1).
  * Made it so that the game doesn't go unresponsive to the OS when dying or after winning the Venus mission (meaning you don't have to wait for the game to proceed to the Game Over / Credits screen before you can quit the game normally, and also preventing weird bugs if you resize the window during that time).
  * Made it so that resizing the window in the credits screen repositions the credits text to the new center.
  * Simulated the smaller Kline health bars of version 1.1 in Classic difficulty. While Kline's health bar is still the larger size, its display is broken up into sections so that it now perfectly simulates version 1.1's Kline health bar behavior (a previous release already caused the portions of the health bar to be reduced in "steps", so they already behaved as if they were multiple health bars in Classic difficulty).
  * Made it possible to switch to concentrate mode even with the Super Charge in Classic difficulty, as was the case in the original.
  * Caused star position to be recalculated when you resize the window. This prevents weird gaps in the starfield when you make the window bigger in the middle of a mission, for instance.
  * Added an option to compile a binary that will attempt to use the original music. We won't be distributing that music because that is a violation of copyright, but for those who have the music and want to mod it into the game (no pun intended), it is now possible to do this without changing the source code. Simply pass SF_OLD_MUSIC=1 as an option to the configure script and it will attempt to load the original music file names and use them exactly as version 1.1 did.
  * Corrected the damage of micro rockets and triple-spread plasma bullets for Classic difficulty. These were both doubled at some point for balancing, so Classic difficulty now lowers the damage they inflict to their original values.
- Add a language package.
- Add appdata.patch for https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:AppStore

- Update to version 2.3.2
  * Fixed some spelling errors.
  * Replaced use of AUDIO_S16 with the correct AUDIO_S16SYS; the
    effect of this is that the old definition could potentially
    cause sound distortions depending on the platform which
    shouldn't happen anymore.
  * Replaced use of "stupid" in some dialog with "foolish", since
    we've been trying to avoid careless sanist rhetoric in projects
    we manage recently. "Foolish" is a more neutral term that
    doesn't carry any negative connotations toward mentally
    disabled people.
  * Updated the starfighter.desktop file to be more complete.
  * Fixed leftover links to the old website.
  * Added a manfile, based on one written by a Debian contributor.
- Update to version 2.3.1
  * Adjusted in-mission dialogs to match the dialogs' timing (with
    one exception, the first Kline encounter, so as not to mess
    with music cues there).
  * Made it so that, during the Kline fight in Classic difficulty,
    Kline's health goes to the health levels of respective stages
    when stage changes. This is done to simulate the behavior of
    the original, where Kline actually had four separate health
    bars that didn't bleed into each other.
  * Fixed a bug in rendering of Unicode text which allowed
    multi-byte Unicode characters to be split into multiple parts.
- Update to version 2.3
  * When someone I'm very close to played Project: Starfighter
    recently, we noticed a major bugs in Project: Starfighter
    pertaining to gamepad control. 
- Update to version 2.2.1
  * Full, proper analog control has been implemented both for
    moving the cursor and for moving your ship. This release also
    fixes a problem where controllers with analog triggers
    wouldn't work correctly.
- Update to version 2.2
  * Added Super-Easy mode, which makes enemies weaker, allies
    stronger, and does various other things to make the game much
    easier.
  * Changed the default difficulty mode from 'Normal" to "Easy".
    Beginners should play Easy mode before Normal mode in my
    opinion, and it's easier to go forward one than back one.
  * Fixed the way spread works in Classic difficulty. It previously
    was handled in a special manner because version 1.2 does it
    that way, but it turns out that that was a change introduced
    by version 1.2, and version 1.1 actually had spread just like
    in every other difficulty mode.
  * "Fixed" the way damage is done with the charge cannon in
    Classic difficulty. It's absolutely ridiculous, but the result
    is so staggeringly different I decided it isn't really a
    genuine classic experience without it. Version 1.1's charge
    cannon was so overpowered that some minibosses could be
    one-shotted with a full blast, due to a quirk in how they
    dissipate. This release restores that behavior in Classic
    difficulty only.
  * Added a difficulty indicator to the titles of save slots.
- Update to version 2.1
  * Improved colorblind accessibility by making friendly bolts
    brighter than enemy bolts and by making the HUD's display of
    powered-up status use brighter colors and textured coloring.
    This change also makes it possible to see all information
    through a heavily red-shifted display.
  * Made it so that the Firefly's exhaust is still displayed when
    low on shield, and halved the amount of explosions shown at
    that time. Prior to this change, the explosions (indicating
    low health) replaced the exhaust entirely, which I thought
    was a bit odd.
  * Except in Classic and Nightmare difficulties, the game now
    waits to start the jump-out sequence until all worthwhile
    powerups have been collected. This in particular ensures that
    you always have a chance to collect all the money that bosses
    drop; it was previously very easy to miss large amounts of it.
  * Except in Classic difficulty, powerups now move outward from
    their ships at only half the speed they used to. This is meant
    to stop them from spreading out incredibly far from the source.
  * Various fixes and improvements, including improvements to
    Gettext translation support.
