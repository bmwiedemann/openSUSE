  * New Features

      Memory footprint should stay low to moderate.

      Qt/Google/Chromium

      QtWebKit

      much BookView functionality
      (see https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit)
    - allows the user to control use of javascript and remote 
      access by epubs when editing to improve overall security
    - adds action to launch one preferred external xhtml editor via
      shortcut or icon

      open-with editor)

      a total of 10 (with all new icons! Thanks so much Becky!)

  It also includes all of the fixes and updates from Sigil-0.9.14.

  Be aware that Sigil-0.9.15 still enforces the need for epub3 to 
  have and support an NCX so that it generates as backward 
  a compatible epub as possible. This may be relaxed in future 
  releases.

      (or any entities at all!)

      CodeView

    - Build our modified gumbo html5 parser as a shared library and 
      provide a bs4 ctypes interface to it for easy xhtml 
      processing in plugins that use Python 2.7 and Python 3.X
    - Allow plugins to auto-fix "text/html" media-types to 
      "application/xhtml+xml"
    - Redesign the ebook source updates upon load process to use 
      our modified gumbo-parser
    - Begin the transition to allow for both epub2 and epub3 
      editing (Note: epub3 editing is still incomplete)
    - Convert Flightcrew to become a Sigil plugin and replace it 
      with a simple and fast internal sanity checker.
    - Update Hunspell dictionaries to be actual dictioanries and 
      not word lists for en_US and en_GB
    - Updated other dictionaries to their most current version to 
      match what is used in LibreOffice 5
    - Fix issue #54 modified date using local numerials when it 
      should be using Arabic numerals per the spec.
    - Set the book to modified when font's are obfuscated.
    - Change FORCE_BUNDLED_COPIES build flag to USE_SYSTEM_LIBS. 
      This flips the meaning of the flag. Now USE_SYSTEM_LIBS will 
      enable using system libraries. Also, SYSTEM_LIBS_REQUIRED was 
      added which will fail the cmake configure if any system 
      libraries are not found instead of falling back to the 
      bundled copy. Finally, this makes the build more consistent 
      for Windows and OS X users.
