      much BookView functionality
      (see https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/PageEdit)

      access by epubs when editing to improve overall security

      open-with editor)

      a total of 10 (with all new icons! Thanks so much Becky!)

  It also includes all of the fixes and updates from Sigil-0.9.14.

  have and support an NCX so that it generates as backward 
  a compatible epub as possible. This may be relaxed in future 
  releases.

  - Features
    - new launcher/wrapper code interface to support plugins that 
      operate on epub3 ebooks
    - added cssutils, cssselect, and chardet to the site-packages 
      of the embedded Python 3.4 interpreter
    - validation plugins that report no errors will now have 
      "No problems found" appear in the Sigil Validation window.
    - validation plugins will auto accept/close the plugin runner 
      window no matter the results
    - Windows installer now detects whether MS redistributable 
      runtimes are already installed
- changes from pre-release 0.8.900
    - Kill tidy and replace it with a combination of a specially 
      modified Gumbo parser that supports html5
    - Kill Xerces and XercesExtras.
    - Kill Boost, replace with C++ 11
    - Kill unused bundles.
    - Replace all "undefined - behaviour" use of "Null" References 
      with proper pointers across entire codebase to allow it to 
      work with the latest clang compilers
    - Completely revamp the build process to embed the Python 3.4 
      Interpreter inside of Sigil and integrate it in, including as 
      site-packages: [lxml, bs4, PIL, regex, six, html5lib].  
      This will allow plugins that use the internal Python 3.X 
      engine access to all of these specialized packaes by default 
      with no additional action needed by end users of their plugin.
    - Create our own version of BeautifulSoup4-4.4.0 called 
      sigil_bs4 that fixes lxml namespace bugs, fixes 
      serialization/prettyprinting of inline xhtml tags, and 
      modifies the bs4 codebase so that a single sourcecode works 
      equally well on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.X
    - Replace internal opf and ncx xml processing and cleaning with 
      a combination of embedded Python 3.4, sigil_bs4 / lxml
    - Build hunspell as a shared library and then add a ctypes 
      interface to allow plugins to spellcheck
    - Build our modified gumbo html5 parser as a shared library and 
      provide a bs4 ctypes interface to it for easy xhtml 
      processing in plugins that use Python 2.7 and Python 3.X
    - Allow plugins to auto-fix "text/html" media-types to 
      "application/xhtml+xml"
    - Redesign the ebook source updates upon load process to use 
      our modified gumbo-parser
    - Begin the transition to allow for both epub2 and epub3 
      editing (Note: epub3 editing is still incomplete)
    - Convert Flightcrew to become a Sigil plugin and replace it 
      with a simple and fast internal sanity checker.
    - Update Hunspell dictionaries to be actual dictioanries and 
      not word lists for en_US and en_GB
    - Updated other dictionaries to their most current version to 
      match what is used in LibreOffice 5
    - Fix issue #54 modified date using local numerials when it 
      should be using Arabic numerals per the spec.
    - Set the book to modified when font's are obfuscated.
    - Change FORCE_BUNDLED_COPIES build flag to USE_SYSTEM_LIBS. 
      This flips the meaning of the flag. Now USE_SYSTEM_LIBS will 
      enable using system libraries. Also, SYSTEM_LIBS_REQUIRED was 
      added which will fail the cmake configure if any system 
      libraries are not found instead of falling back to the 
      bundled copy. Finally, this makes the build more consistent 
      for Windows and OS X users.
