%description
SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular
sound file formats, such as wav, ogg mp3 and midi. SDL_sound can just
play a file or alternatively decode a file and hand back a single
pointer to the waveform. SDL_sound also can handle channel conversion
on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes.
