%description
Spatial4j is a general purpose spatial / geospatial ASL licensed open-source
Java library. Itâ€™s core capabilities are 3-fold: to provide common shapes that
can work in Euclidean and geodesic (surface of sphere) world models, to provide
distance calculations and other math, and to read & write shapes from formats
like WKT and GeoJSON. Spatial4j is a project of the LocationTech Industry
Working Group of the Eclipse Foundation.
