  <title>Bootstrapping tool for creating supermin appliances</title>
  <description>
supermin is a tool for building supermin appliances. These are tiny
appliances (similar to virtual machines), usually around 100KB in size,
which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a second when
you need to boot one of them.
