Sun Mar 27 18:46:34 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.5:
  * Add Makefile targets for installing shell completions
  * stg rebase --interactive learns ‘hide’ instruction
  * Picked patch names are preserved when possible (#175)
  * Replace --unapplied option with --noapply for stg pick (#174)
  * stg pick --noapply no longer reverses patch order (#174)
  * Use stg version uses sys.executable to get Python version.
  * Repair stg repair with amended first patch (#163)
  * Repair corner cases where invalid patchnames could be generated by stg new,
    stg uncommit, etc. (#176)
  * stg mail could crash due to a misspelled reference (#178)
  * Zsh completion for stg refresh -p now completes against all patches (not
    just applied patches).
  * Zsh gains missing completion for stg push --noapply
  * Minor repair to help for stg float --noapply and stg push --noapply
  * Restore stg sink --nopush capability.
  * The new stg import --message-id option causes the Message-ID from imported
    emails to be included as the Message-Id trailer in the patch description
  * The new ‘stgit.import.message-id’ config option also enables the Message-Id
    trailer
  * stg import no longer creates “Message-Id” trailer by default when importing
    patches from email
  * StGit works with Python 3.10
  * stg version prints a more abbreviated Python version
    stg commit will no longer commit empty patches by default; the
    --allow-empty option may be used to override this behavior (#158)
  * The stgit.main.main() function now takes an argv parameter and returns an
    int return code in most cases instead of calling sys.exit(), thus making
    main() a bit easier to use as an API.
  * Repair stack upgrade with stg branch --list (#155)
  * Repair crash in stg squash with out of order patches and no name specified (#157)
  * Zsh completions learn stg float --noapply option
  * Zsh completion for stg sink now allows multiple patches
  * Repair crash regression when using stgit.autosign
  * stg rebase learns --interactive; easily re-order, edit, squash, fixup, or
    delete patches via your editor
  * stg rebase learns --autostash; stash changes before the rebase and apply
    them after. Also configurable with the stgit.autostash configuration option
  * stg edit can now rename patches
  * stg edit gains helpful instructions
  * stg new learns --verbose, which includes a diff in the editor window
    (similar to git commit --verbose). This behavior is also configurable with
    the stgit.new.verbose configuration option
  * stg push and stg float learn --noapply option; allows patches to be
    reordered without updating worktree and deferring merge conflict resolution
  * stg edit, stg refresh, and stg new learn the --sign-by, --ack-by, and
    --review-by options which allow those respective trailers' values to be
    specified by the user on the command line
  * Stack metadata version 5; stack metadata is moved from
    refs/heads/<branch>.stgit to refs/stacks/<branch> and the stack metadata
    file now uses a JSON format instead of the prior custom format; the stack
    metadata will be upgraded to v5 on first use of this version of StGit; like
    all stack metadata upgrades, this is a one-way auto-upgrade for existing
    stacks
  * Use setuptools instead of distutils for packaging
  * No git or python version checks in setup.py
  * Use different dynamic versioning system
  * Install stg executable as console_script entry point
  * More sophisticated search for bash.exe on Windows when running hooks
  * The editor window text for stg squash has been modified to mirror git’s
    behavior – the squash edit message now includes all commits
  * Binary diffs are no longer shown when with stg edit -d
  * Multiple trailers can now be added at once; this is now allowed, for
    example: stg edit --sign --review --ack
  * Update zsh completion for stg rebase to show local and remote heads (#102)
  * Zsh completions for commands with patch arguments now comprehend the effect
    of -b/--branch and -B/--ref-branch
  * Zsh completions now guard patch names–one less TAB press to complete patch
    names in certain contexts
  * stg import now extracts the Message-ID email header into the patch message
  * Repair crash when attempting to export empty patch
  * Exact command name matches are unambiguous
  * Exiting with an empty stg edit editor will now abort the edit; previously
    it would delete your commit message.
  * Repair completions when stg.series.description is enabled in config
  * Workaround child process reaping race on Windows
  * Repair crash with stg float --series when bad patch name in series
  * Repair zsh completion for stg float to accept multiple patch names
  * StGit GPG-signs patches when commit.gpgsign is set
  * Support core.hooksPath in git config
  * Add -C option for stg import and stg fold
  * Allow importing mail and series from urls
  * stg refresh --edit may also use --diff and --diff-opts
  * stg goto allows sha1 of a patch instead of patch name
  * Repair hang in stg pull -m, stg goto -m, and stg push -m
  * Repair stg mail to show diffstat of whole series
  * Repair MANIFEST.in to include AUTHORS.md and README.md files
  * Drop support for Python < 3.5
  * Remove previously deprecated stg publish command
  * Removed contrib scripts: stg-swallow, stg-fold-files-from, stg-dispatch,
    stg-whatchanged, and stg-show-old
  * The pre-commit hook is now run for stg refresh
  * New --spill option for stg refresh
  * Add stgit.series.description config option
  * Official support for Python versions up to 3.9
  * Stack metadata format 4. All metadata now kept in Git objects; no more
    stack state files in .git/patches. A one-way auto-upgrade to format version
    4 will occur when StGit commands are run on an existing StGit branch.
  * Use python3 in shebangs instead of python
  * contrib/stgbashprompt.sh is no longer executable
  * Internal docstrings now use reStructuredText instead of Epytext
  * Importing large patches is much, much faster
  * Other performance improvements when dealing with large patches
  * Repair diffstat when outside work tree root
  * Use encoded (string) environment variables on Windows
  * Fix stg pull when no upstream is configured
  * Fix refresh crash with path limiting and files added to index
  * Repair new with patchdescr.template crash
  * Repair log from worktree subdir with patches specified
  * Repair import allowing/generating duplicate patch names
  * Repair mail --auto to strip comments after addrs
