This version of SuperLU is slightly different form the original SuperLU
available on http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/. For legal reasons the
routine mc64ad from the Harwell Subroutine Library cannot be redistributed
by openSUSE and have been removed form the sources.

mc64ad.c sgsisx.c sldperm.c dgsisx.c dldperm.c cgsisx.c cldperm.c zgsisx.c zldperm.c
were removed from the tarball.

However the SuperLU library provided by openSUSE is fully functionnal
except that the mc64ad routine is not used.
