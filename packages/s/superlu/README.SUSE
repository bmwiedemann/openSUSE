This version of SuperLU is slightly different form the original SuperLU
available on http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/. For legal reasons the
routine mc64ad from the Harwell Subroutine Library cannot be redistributed
by openSUSE and have been removed form the sources. Only SRC/mc64ad.c was
removed from the tarball.

However the SuperLU library provided by openSUSE is fully functionnal
except that the mc64ad routine is not used.
