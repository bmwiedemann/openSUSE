-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 12:25:27 UTC 2020 - Johannes Weberhofer <jweberhofer@weberhofer.at>

- Upgrade to version 2.0.0
  Version 2 of sslscan includes a major rewrite of the backend scanning code,
  which means that it is no longer reliant on the version of OpenSSL for many
  checks. This means that it is possible to support legacy protocols (SSLv2 and
  SSLv3), as well as supporting TLSv1.3 - regardless of the version of OpenSSL
  that it has been compiled against. It is still recommended to build statically
  where possible, but dynamically built version should be significantly more
  useful.

  Note that there are also some breaking changes to the XML output, which are 
  documented in the readme file.

  This rewrite been made possible largely by the work of jtesta, who has been
  responsible for most of the backend rewrite.

- Cleaned up spec file
