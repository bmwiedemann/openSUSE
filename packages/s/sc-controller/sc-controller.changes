Tue Nov 20 21:03:24 UTC 2018 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix dependencies by means of introspection (boo#1116778):
  + Add gobject-introspection BuildRequires: since the code is
    written with gobject-introspection in mind, having the BR adds
    a set of rpm provides/requires based on code inspection
  + Drop typelib-1-0-Rsvg-2_0 requires: with g-i above in place,
    this dependency is autodetected.
  + Replace python-gobject requires with python-gobject-Gdk: since
    this is a GUI tool, we need the Gdk/Gtk-part of pygobject in
    plus.
