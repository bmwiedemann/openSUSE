  <title>Software TPM Emulator</title>
  <description>The SWTPM package provides TPM emulators with different front-end interfaces
to libtpms. TPM emulators provide socket interfaces (TCP/IP) and the Linux
CUSE interface for the creation of multiple native /dev/vtpm* devices.
Those can be the targets of multiple QEMU cuse-tpm instances.</description>
