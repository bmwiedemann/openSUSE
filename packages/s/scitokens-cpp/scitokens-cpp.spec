%description
SciTokens provide a token format for distributed authorization. The tokens are
self-describing, can be verified in a distributed fashion (no need to contact
the issuer to determine if the token is valid). This is convenient for a
federated environment where several otherwise-independent storage endpoints
want to delegate trust for an issuer for managing a storage allocation.
