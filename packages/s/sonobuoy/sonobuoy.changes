- update to 0.56.0:
  * Overview
    This release found a surprisingly large amount of new features
    and improvements including: The common theme in these features
    is that they are about making what you might already do,
    better:
    - Cut down on CI time with the new --mode=conformance-lite
      option
    - Better understand and plan which tests and tags to run with
      sonobuoy e2e without having to launch a single pod
    - Gather API data and logs from the CLI without launching pods
    - Run Sonobuoy with reduced permissions more easily and
      reliably (--aggregator-permissions)
  * New Features
    - Sonobuoy Modes and 'conformance-lite'
      - 0e4a1c5 Add sonobuoy modes command
      - f105e68 Add conformance-lite mode Sonobuoy has a new
        command
      sonobuoy modes which lists the what each of the various
      --mode options means for the E2E plugin.
      This allows users to choose the appropriate mode without even
      having to navigate to the web documentation.
      Instead, sonobuoy modes shows the the name of the mode, its
      purpose, and its focus/skip/parallel values.
      A new option for --mode was added: conformance-lite which
      runs the fastest tests from the conformance suite (~80%) in
      parallel.
      This allows running of hundreds of tests in just minutes
      which can cut down CI and debugging times.
    - E2E Improvements: Built in E2E Dry-run and Airgapped
      Simplification
      - 90dd4c1 Add e2e command for dry-run help
      - 7af4fe2 Support KUBE_TEST_REPO
      We still get numerous questions regarding what tests from the
      E2E conformance suite can/should be run or what tags are
      available.
      Built into the conformance tests is a "dry-run" feature which
      allows you to try out regular expressions and filter the
      tests without running them.
      However, doing this still requires you launch Sonobuoy and
      e2e pods, gather results, and inspect them.
      The new sonobuoy e2e command will allow you to try out
      focus/skip values and immediately get the resulting test
      list.
      Not only that, but by editing the output --mode, you can
      print only the test tags with or without their respective
      frequency counts.
    - Sonobuoy Queries from the CLI
      - 5577b2d Refactor query logic and add to CLI
      Sonobuoy gathers lots of data from the API in order to aid in
      debugging.
      If you want that information without bothering with launching
      any pods at all, just run sonobuoy query.
      All the query logic has been extracted and made available on
      the CLI for faster, easier access.
    - More Permissions Options For Sonobuoy
      - a4ca834 Add namespaced permissions with cluster read
      The --aggregator-permissions options have expanded to
      include:
      - clusterRead which is namespace admin permissions with added
        read-only permissions at the cluster level
      - namespaceAdmin which has no cluster permissions, only
        namespaced ones
      - the default clusterAdmin
      In most cases the default is a good choice, but in production
      clusters where access is more carefully monitored, the other
      options may be a better fit.
  * Improvements and Bug Fixes
    - aea30a0 Adjust progress messages to allow for appending data
      - Plugins can now report progress updates in more piecemeal
        fashion and the aggregator will combine the results. This
        fixes a bug where the e2e plugin couldn't report progress
        when in parallel mode. The fix will be in Sonobuoy, but the
        upstream fix will get put into releases going forward.
    - 94b6f18 Allow setting aggregator env vars via CLI
      - Sonobuoy now allows you to set environment variables on the
        aggregator from the CLI via the existing --plugin-env flag
        using the reserved plugin name sonobuoy. For instance,
        --plugin-env sonobuoy.KEY=val.
    - 9ba34dc Modify entrypoint for getting e2e test images
      - Fixed a bug which caused sonobuoy images to fail for
        Kubernetes v1.22+
    - c7c47dc Roles and bindings should have namespace label for
      deletion
      - Fixed a bug which caused cluster roles and bindings to not
        be deleted.
        Modified the behavior of sonobuoy delete --all to include
        deleting all cluster roles related to any Sonobuoy run,
        regardless of namespace.
        Added back a "namespace" label for ClusterRoles and
        ClusterRoleBindings in order to properly associate them
        with their Sonobuoy run.
    - ec3df49 Continue with run even if unable to query nodes
      - Fixed a bug which caused the new
        --aggregator-permissions=namespaceAdmin option to fail due
        to the inability to query cluster nodes.

- update to 0.55.0:
  * Overview
    This is a fairly big release with a number of worthwhile
    improvements and bug fixes that we would recommend users take
    advantage of, including:
    - Simplified results reporting for many plugins
    - Better handling of multi-container plugins
    - Bug fixes related to results storage and cooperation between
      components
    - A new command to wait on an existing Sonobuoy run
    - More os/arch support
    - and more
  * Improvements
    - Sonobuoy automatically reports results if your plugin
      completes and exits 0
      One of the most frustrating types of bugs is where the plugin
      container runs successfully but fails to write the done file
      to inform the Sonobuoy worker that it has completed and where
      to find the results.
      We decided to add a bit more intelligence to the worker to
      avoid many of these cases. Now, if the worker container is
      the only container left running and the others all exited
      with a status code of 0, the worker will automtaically upload
      the entire results directory to the aggregator on your
      behalf.
      - e4f0a0d Sonobuoy workers report results of completed plugins
    - Add environment variables and mounts to sidecar containers
      Now that Sonobuoy adds a few environment variables to the
      containers it creates (Kuberentes version, directory
      locations, etc), it is reasonable that we should be adding
      these to the sidecars and other containers in the plugin.
      - 9ae72e6 Add all env vars to all containers
    - Running Sonobuoy without any plugins
      Many releases ago it was possible to run Sonobuoy without any
      plugins as solely a means of gathering the other debug
      information. This use case was dropped at some point but we
      have found that some users relied on it so we are adding it
      back in a simpler fashion.
      If you want to run Sonobuoy but not run any plugins, just add
      SkipPlugins: true to the Sonobuoy config file (e.g.  sonobuoy
      gen config then edit the file). This will clear out the
      plugin selections so that the aggregator has no plugins to
      load.
      - 8c57b24 Add special config option to skip all plugins
    - New build artifacts: s390x and ppc64le
      Kubectl supports these formats and so should we. Thanks to
      @barthy1 and @MatthieuSarter for this help.
      - 06f5616 Update build setup to publish sonobuoy binary and
        image for s390x and ppc64le
    - Add a new sonobuoy wait command
      Sometimes you start a sonobuoy run and then later decide you
      wish you had provided --wait. We added a convenience command
      to effectively do that. Just run sonobuoy wait to wait for
      the Sonobuoy run in the targeted namespace to complete.
      - 17b7050 Add sonobuoy wait command
    - Rename plugins on a per-run basis without editing YAML
      Now that locally Sonobuoy can install/lookup different
      plugins and configurations, it is much more likely that a
      user may want to run two different configurations of the same
      plugin at the same time. However, Sonobuoy requires that
      plugin names are unique.
      To avoid having to edit the YAML each time this may occur,
      you can edit the plugin name for that individual run by a new
      bit of syntactic sugar:
        $ sonobuoy run -p <old-name>@<new-name>
      - 0434aa0 Allow plugin renaming via @ seperator in flag name
    - Reworking sonobuoy plugins list output
      We are still working out the best approach for some of the
      plugin management commands. As part of that effort we've
      reworked the sonobuoy plugins list output to make it more
      succinct and to try and make it more clear how to invoke the
      plugin from the command line.
      - a01be9b Clarify plugin list output surrounding name/file
  * Bug Fixes
    - Fix bugs involving a custom ResultsDir
      A few issues have occurred lately where it became clear that
      the ResultsDir field of the Sonobuoy config was not being
      respected or passed correctly between the different bits of
      code.
      As such, there were situations where the plugin and
      sonobuoy-worker disagreed about where the results should be
      stored or mounted from and other bugs where the CLI client
      and aggregator pod would disagree about where the aggregator
      stored the final product.
      - 9bf47ef Pass ResultsDir through necessary calls
    - Fixed a bug causing nodeSelectors to not be properly respected
      If your daemonset plugin is OS-specific, you'll need to have
      the nodeSelector set to target the right nodes.
      However, Sonobuoy goes beyond the default Kubernetes tracking
      and will monitor which nodes have or have not yet run the
      plugin. It is important that Sonobuoy properly understands
      the nodeSelector being used or else it will constantly expect
      other nodes to report results when none will occur due to the
      scheduling limitation.
      - 4b072ef Fix plugin nodeSelector issue inc. systemd-logs
    - Fixed a bug causing some pod logs to be dropped
      Fixed a race in sonobuoy logs that sometimes caused logs from
      random containers to not be gathered.
      Also added a new special case to get just the logs from the
      Sonobuoy aggregator pod:
        $ sonobuoy logs -p sonobuoy
      - 95eb1e2 Fix logs bug causing aggregator to be dropped

- update to 0.54.0:
  * Overview
    This is a big release filled with new features, bug fixes, and
    UX improvements for all Sonobuoy users and plugin developers.
  * Major Changes
    - By default, sonobuoy run --wait and sonobuoy delete --wait
      will now output much more information. This was an
      experimental feature for a release and it was extremely
      useful. When waiting on a run, the user is effectively given
      timestamped changes to sonobuoy status data so you can see
      when plugins are progressing. When running sonobuoy delete
      --wait, the JSON for the namespace is output as it changes.
      This makes it clear what is causing namespace deletion to be
      slow or hang.
    - Adds some basic plugin management capabilities. You can now
      try out sonobuoy plugin install <file or URL> and it will
      store the plugin in a central location so that when you run
      sonobuoy run -p myplugin the plugin doesn't have to reside in
      the present working directory. Expect a blog post on this
      feature as it is a very new capability and we have some ideas
      how to make it better.
    - Sonobuoy now supports plugin results in go-json format
      - This is the format from go test --json and enables us to
        support the upstream e2e-framework. To write a plugin that
        uses this format, simply change the result-type to go-json.
    - Added a securityContext by default and set the
      user/group/fsGroup; this prevents certain security tools from
      blocking typical Sonobuoy runs. This is not supported on
      Windows nodes so a flag was added to turn off this
      functionality (--security-context-mode=none) if desired.
    - Adds multiple new env vars to plugin environments when run
      including:
      - SONOBUOY=true to indicate that it was launched by Sonobuoy
      - SONOBUOY_CONFIG_DIR to identify where configmaps will be
        mounted at
      - SONOBUOY_RESULTS_DIR to identify where the results should
        be saved
    - By default, Sonobuoy will now gather logs for all pods in
      kube-system and will query all API resources it can,
      including CRDs (but not secrets!)
    - Add --rerun-failed flag to sonobuoy run. This takes a
      filename as a parameter and will walk the given tarball for
      e2e results and adjust the E2E_FOCUS accordingly to target
      just those failed tests. This is meant to be a replacement
      for the older sonobuoy e2e command.
  * Minor Changes
    - sonobuoy gen will not support all the flags that sonobuoy run
      does including things like --wait and --skip-preflight in
      order to make it easier to change back and forth between run
      and gen for testing
    - Fixed a bug where --level was not respected on the aggregator
      container and added more logging at the --level=trace.
    - Documented underlying issues with supporting Kubernetes for
      Docker Desktop
    - Removed managed field data from the data that Sonobuoy
      queries. This is usually not relevant for users and is
      verbose and confusing.
    - Fixed a bug which caused podLogs to only be gathered for one
      pod (typically the Sonobuoy aggregator)
    - Adds a useful dev feature: if SONOBUOY_DEV_REPO is set, it
      will use that repo for the default Sonobuoy image to
      facilitate faster iteration
    - Fixed a bug where a plugin's name would cause an invalid
      configmap name to be generated. A few more restrictions and
      validation were added to make the naming limitation more
      clear.
    - Fixed a bug where, when a plugin failed, the Sonobuoy
      aggregator status would report itself as failed regardless of
      other plugins. This was originally by design but as we have
      more fine-grained reporting abilities now, it is not
      necessary and is potentially confusing.

- update to 0.53.2:
  Shortly after releasing v0.53.1 a bug was found that impacted
  certified-conformance mode. Since this is an important function
  of Sonobuoy, we decided to release a patch for this single
  change. See more details
  [here](https://sonobuoy.io/docs/v0.53.1/issue1388/).
  * Changelog
    - 981a3ff Point release for certified-conformance issue
    - a650400 Add documentation about issue 1388
    - 3a522d4 Fix regression regarding certified-conformance mode
- update to 0.53.1:
  *NOTE*
  This version of Sonobuoy was impacted by #1388 and as a result we
  decided to push a new point release. Users interested in
  certified-conformance mode should use a newer version and/or see
  here for more details.

  Sonobuoy v0.53.1
  This patch release includes a few bug and security fixes. No
  other new functionality was added.
  * Fix typo which broken custom registries for e2e plugin
    (373bdc2)
    - It would be looking in /tmp/sonobuoy/configs/... for the file
      but it should have been config without an s.
  * Updates various references for security reasons (584a3e0)
    - There were 3 separate CVEs that were reported to us as a
      result of different dependencies. By updating these we
      resolved the vulnerabilities. The CVEs were from client-go,
      k8s.io/api/v1/core, jwt-go, and protobuf.
  * Fix broken link after plugins moved (bb9776e)
    - We moved all our example plugins into the separate
      github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobouy-plugins repository and had
      failed to update the links in our documentation.
  * Warn if kubernetes-version and set with conflicting flags
    (7b2fe4d)
    - If kubernetes-version and kube-conformance-image[-version]
      are both set then some unexpected results can occur. This
      mitigates the problem by providing a warning of that fact.
- update to 0.53.0:
  *NOTE*
  This version of Sonobuoy was impacted by #1388 and as a result we
  decided to push a new point release. Users interested in
  certified-conformance mode should use a newer version and/or see
  here for more details.

  Sonobuoy v0.53.0
  This release includes numerous small improvements and two
  experimental features which we expect to become default behavior
  in the future: better progress reporting when --wait is used and
  plugin management.
  * Plugin Management (9539f16)
    All users can take advantage of new commands to help manage
    your plugins. This helps keep track of plugins so that you can
    save them from URLs/files and invoke them more easily from any
    other directory. See sonobuoy plugins for commands to install,
    uninstall, list, and show plugins.
    In the future, Sonobuoy will look for installed plugins before
    looking in the present working directory. If you would like to
    enable this behavior now, set the environment variable
    SONOBUOY_ALL_FEATURES=true or
    SONOBUOY_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION=true.
  * Progress Messages (eeff4bf)
    Currently, when you invoke sonobuoy run --wait or sonobuoy
    delete --wait the default --output-mode is silent. The only
    alternative, until now, has been a spinner to ensure CI and
    end-users don't think Sonobuoy has frozen.
    However, we often have more information that would be useful
    for a user to know about the progress made. As a result, we've
    added a new option --wait-output=progress which will output
    more valuable information.
    This may become the default in the future but to enable it now
    you can either specify it manually with --wait-output=progress
    or with SONOBUOY_ALL_FEATURES=true.
  * Minor Changes
    - Sonobuoy Retrieve (8cf38a5)
      Adds a new flag --filename -f to specify the exact name of
      the tarball once it has been downloaded. This may ease the
      burden when writing scripts.
    - Custom Log Levels (69cdfc5)
      We've added a --level flag for custom log levels so you can
      get more/less output based on your needs.
    - New Fields For Plugin Definitions
      Added source-url and description fields so that a plugin can
      be more self-documenting. This will be of great use when
      plugins can be installed/organized more easily.
    - ImagePullPolicy Change (60adfff)
      If you specify the --image-pull-policy flag, it will now be
      applied to all plugins, not just the built in e2e and
      systemd-logs plugins. The reasoning is that we would like to
      make custom plugins and built-in plugins have as much parity
      as possible.

- update to 0.52.0:
  This release comes on the heels of our v0.51.0 but includes an
  incredibly some incredibly useful improvements for custom
  plugins: variable image names and ConfigMap embedding.
  We made these changes to better fulfill our goal of running the
  Kubernetes E2E tests on Windows as easily as possible. Our new
  windows-e2e plugins make use of both of these features.
  * ConfigMaps Embedded in Your Plugin (d2e9dfe)
    - Plugins can now specify ConfigMap data directly in the plugin
      specification file itself. The new config-map field is an
      optional, sibling field to the sonobuoy-config and spec
      fields. Sonobuoy will automatically generate a ConfigMap with
      that data and mount it as a volume on your plugin so it can
      consume the data. This allows you to more easily bundle and
      share your plugin configuration with others.
  * Variable-based Plugin Images (eed1cd7)
    This feature allows plugins to base their plugin image on the
    version of Kubernetes detected in their cluster. This behavior
    was previously reserved for our custom e2e plugin, but has been
    generalized for other plugins. Simply use $SONOBUOY_K8S_VERSION
    in the image name to make use of it.
    It is also available automatically as an environment variable
    (by the same name) in your plugin.
- update to 0.51.0:
  * Major changes
    - Windows support af895d7 63d1573 fcc107c
      The largest announcement of this release is that Sonobuoy
      will now build/publish images for Windows nodes. This means
      that plugins can be easily written for and run on Windows
      nodes. Various other changes this release were motivated by
      this change to work towards making the Windows experience as
      positive as possible. Check out our blog on more regarding
      Windows support.
  * Other Improvements
    - 0586df2 Improve retrieve command with extraction option
      sonobuoy retrieve now has an --extract flag which will
      download then extract the tarball in the specified directory
      (defaults to the present working directory).
    - 9b9e6e8 Add support for testing against the most recent dev
      E2E image
      This helps simplify the workflow if you find yourself
      actively working on the tip of Kubernetes. Test against the
      master branch of k8s by specifying the
      --kube-conformance-image-version=latest. It does use a
      version that is built periodically and may lag what you see
      in github but minutes/hours.
    - 649cfac E2E Image ignores metadata and provider build info
      This should make things work more seamlessly when you use
      clusters created by cloud providers which may add their own
      metadata onto the build information (e.g.
      v0.19.3+aks.some.info). Now we'll just ignore all the
      metadata and assume you want to test with the upstream
      version provided.
    - d7d930c Extend default timeout
      The amount of time Sonobuoy waits for the plugins to report
      is always customizable with the --timeout flag, but we
      extended the default timeout from 3 to 6 hours in order to
      avoid timeouts potentially caused by running on Windows
      clusters where pods take longer to startup/shutdown.
    - 2c86eb1 Add node selector option when generating plugin spec
      Adds a new flag: sonobuoy gen plugin --node-selector foo=bar
      to facilitate creating windows plugins more easily.
    - c96ae19 Adjust default nodeSelector behavior
      Along with the above change, by not specifying a nodeSelector
      Sonobuoy will assume you want to target Linux nodes. This, in
      most cases, avoids an issue where you have a Windows node in
      a cluster and it causes your (Linux) plugin to accidently run
      on that node and fail.
  * Bug fixes
    - 04acfcb Avoid infinite loop when a following logs
    - And other misc. fixes in the documentation such as spelling,
      tweaks for clarity, and fixing broken links.
- update to 0.50.0:
  * New version
    This release introduce support for distroless images for
    Sonobuoy. The release also resetting its release version by
    increasing the release number to v0.50.
    Read more here https://sonobuoy.io/sonobuoy-v0-50/.
  * Documentation update
    Part of this release includes migrating the content generator,
    for the Sonobuoy site, to use the Hugo content server. This
    should make content management and generation faster and
    easier.
  * New Reliability Scanner plugin blog
    The realibility scanner was announced earlier this year. It is
    a Sonobuoy plugin that allows cluster operators to configure a
    set of reliability checks to be executed against a cluster. You
    can find a write up here.
