  <title>Sokoban-like game</title>
  <description>Skladnik is an implementation of the Japanese warehouse keeper game “sokoban”.

The idea is that you are a warehouse keeper trying to push crates to their proper
locations in a warehouse. The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step
over them. If you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong
places and/or block your way.
