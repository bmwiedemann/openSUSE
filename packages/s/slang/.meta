  <title>Programming Library and Embeddable Extansion Language</title>
  <description>S-Lang is a multi-platform programming library designed to allow a developer to
create robust multi-platform software. It provides facilities required by
interactive applications such as display/screen management, keyboard input,
keymaps etc. Another major feature of the library is the interpreter for the
S-Lang extension language which can be embedded into an application to make it
extensible. With slsh a standalone interpreter is available as well.</description>
