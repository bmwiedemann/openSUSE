- update to version 2.10-1:
  * gpg-key2ps: Security fix for CVE-2018-15599: unsafe shell call enabling
    shell injection via a User ID.  Use Perl's (core) module Encode.pm instead
    of shelling out to `iconv`. (Closes: #928256.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 14:36:52 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 2.9:
  * gpglist:
    + When --signer's argument is a long keyid or fingerprint, don't require
      the key to be present in the keyring.  This enable filtering on unknown
      signing keys.
    + Don't choke on direct-key signatures. (Closes: #921331.)
  * gpgparticipants:
    + Improve quoting and replace `echo` with `printf`.
    + Avoid including subkey fingerprints when gpg.conf contains 'fingerprint'.
- update to version 2.8:
  * keyart, gpgparticipants-prefill: port to python3.
  * keyart:
    + Don't print ASCII art for subkeys, only the master key.
    + Pass --no-auto-check-trustdb flag to gpg(1).
    + Fix crash with non-ASCII UIDs.  Patch from Grégoire Detrez.
  * Fix a couple of spelling errors.  Thanks to Edward Betts for the report
    and patch. (Closes: debian#882729)
  * caff:
    + Add the "only-sign-text-ids" to the list of gpg(1) options imported from
      ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.
    + Ensure the terminal is "sane enough" when asking questions ('echo',
      'echok', 'icanon', 'icrnl' settings are all set), and restore original
      settings when exit()'ing the program. (Closes: #872529)
  * caff, gpglist, gpgsigs: in `gpg --with-colons` output, allow signature
    class to be followed with an optional revocation reason. gpg(1) does that
    since 2.2.9. (Closes: #905097.)
  * caff, gpg-key2latex, gpg-key2ps, gpglist, gpgsigs, keylookup: Remove
    references to https://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/ .
  * caff, gpg-key2latex, gpg-key2ps, gpg-mailkeys, gpglist, gpgparticipants,
    gpgsigs, keylookup: Remove SVN keywords ($Id$, $Rev$, etc.)
  * sig2dot: Don't use the diamond operator.

Mon Feb  4 11:51:55 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Spec cleanup 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 10:04:38 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.7:
  * gpg-key2ps: Add support for ECDH, ECDSA and EDDSA key types.
  * gpg-key2ps: Align key type & size listing to the GnuPG 2.1.x
    output (e.g., "rsa4096/DEADBEEF" instead of "4096R/DEADBEEF")
  * gpgsigs: Set UAT (jpeg photos) density to 90dpi so XeLaTeX
    doesn't complain that the image is too large

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  9 09:54:16 UTC 2017 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.6:
  * gpgsigs: Skip undefined UIDs.
  * gpgsigs: Properly handle (skip) unknown attributes.
  * gpgsigs: Allow digest hexadecimal characters to replace multiple
    '_' in the fill-in forms
  * gpglist: New option '--signer' to limit listed signers to the
    matching keys.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 26 06:34:34 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.5:
  * caff: Show how to set $ENV{'PERL_MAILERS'} to specify a
    sendmail binary (or use a sendmail-compatible MTA)
  * caff: Fix regression skipping --recv-key when 'keys-from-gnupg'
    isn't set.  (Closes: #837406)
  * caff: List all UIDs contained in an email when asking whether
    to send it.
  * gpg-key2latex: Add an option '--qrcode-data' to specify the
    data to encode in a QR code (default: "OPENPGP4FPR:%f").
  * gpg-key2ps: Fix revoked UID stroke slant with "-r strike".
  * gpg-key2ps: Ensure subkeys are hiden unless '--show-subkeys' is
    set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 13 08:47:59 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.4:
  * caff, gpg-key2latex, gpgsigs: Ignore "KEY_CONSIDERED" status
    output emitted by gpg 2.1.13 and later.
  * caff, gpgsigs: Allow input produced by gpgparticipants(1) using
    gpg 2.1.13.  With this version, key IDs are not displayed by
    default and the "Key fingerprint = " prefix is omitted.
  * caff:
    + Fix GnuPG version number comparison.
    + With GnuPG 2.1.13 or later, use gpgconf(1) to determine the 
     socket paths.  (It is not used on earlier gpg since earlier
     gpgconf do not support --homedir.)  This fixes compatibility
     with GnuPG 2.1.13.
  + When ~/.caff/gnupghome/gpg.conf does not exist, instead of
    creating a temporary file (as it's done since signing-party 2.3),
    parse ~/.gnup/gpg.conf and pass the GnuPG options that are known
    to be safe  (and useful) for caff to gpg(1) using command line
    options. This soves the problem of lingering configuration files
    in case caff is killed.
  + Use full fingerprints internally to avoid collisions.
    (However $CONFIG{'keyid'} and $CONFIG{'local-users'} are kept
    to 64-bits key IDs as per RFC 4880 full fingerprints are not
    available in key signatures, and thus not exposed by
    `gpg --with-colons --list-sigs`.)
  + Automatically import the $CONFIG{'also-encrypt-to'} from the
    normal GnuPGHOME when possible.

- Correct path to _defaultdocdir in caff(1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  8 15:32:20 UTC 2016 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.3:
   * caff:
     + Deprecate $CONFIG{'keyserver'}.  Users of GnuPG <2.1 should
       put the option in caff's GnuPG configuration file
       (~/.caff/gnupghome/gpg.conf by default) instead. GnuPG 2.1
       delegates network access to another process (dirmngr), hence
       for 2.1 the keyserver should be set in ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf instead.
     + When caff's own GnuPG configuration file (~/.caff/gnupghome/gpg.conf)
       does not exist, automatically generate it with the GnuPG options found
       in ~/.gnup/gpg.conf that are known to be safe (and useful) for caff.
       This includes "keyserver", "keyserver-options", "ask-cert-level" and
       "cert-digest-algo" (among many others).  Hence in the absence of its own
       GnuPG configuration file caff now uses the certification options from
       the user's GnuPG configuration file.
     + Perl < 5.20 compatibiliey
       (drop caff-perl_5.18_compatibility.patch)
   * gpgsigs, gpg-key2latex:
     + Use "Noto Mono" as default font when compiling with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX;
       and "Noto Sans Mono CJK" as CJK font when compiling with XeLaTeX.
   * gpg-key2latex:
     + Don't show capabilities of the entire key when --show-subkeys is set.
       (Instead, the capabilities of the master key and each subkey are shown
       independently in uppercase.)
     + Enclose (sub)key capabilities in square brackets, to match GnuPG 2.1.11+'s
       output.
     + For ECDH, ECDSA, EDDSA (sub)keys, show the curve name instead of the
       public key algorithm and length.  This matches GnuPG 2.1.x's output.
     + The master key's fingerprint was incorrectly set to the last unusable
       (eg, expired or revoked) subkey fingerprint, if any.  (Closes: #815721)
   * keyart:
     + Print the public key algorithm and length as shown by GnuPG 2.1 (e.g.,
       "rsa4096" instead of "4096R"); for ECDH, ECDSA and EDDSA keys, show the
       curve name instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 15 02:10:43 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.2:
  * caff:
    + "gpgparticipants"-formated input: accept key blocks not
      starting with a number such as
            [x] Fingerprint(s) OK        [x] ID OK
      This makes caff able to process the Debconf 15 KSP file.
  * gpglist:
    + Don't prune revoked UIDs with a subsequent selfsig.
    + Add an option '--show-revoked' to show revoked UIDs.
    + Mention in the manpage that the path to the gpg binary is
      taken from the GNUPGBIN environment variable, if defined.

- fix an incompatibility with perl 5.18 (boo#955986)
  * caff 2.x is using hash slices which were introduced in Perl 5.20
  * added caff-perl_5.18_compatibility.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 22 21:26:21 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.1:
  * caff:
    + Only consider non-expired/invalid/revoked keys and UIDs when
      generating the caffrc.
    + Proper RFC 5322 validation of email addresses.
    + Prefix the signature by "-- \n" in the email template.
    + Automatically mkdir ~/.caff if it doesn't exit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 22 10:45:24 UTC 2015 - astieger@suse.com

- update to 2.0 [boo#918402]
  * caff:
    + Fix broken compatibility with GnuPG 2.1 (2.1.3 and later only)
    + Default $CONFIG{'local-user'} to $CONFIG{'keyid'} rather than
      importing the public part of *all* keys found in the secret keyring.
    + error output handling improvements
    + Add a --debug flag to enable debug messages.
    + Send attachements and non RFC 2822 UIDs to *all* signed addresses, not
      only those for which the UID is exported.  This is useful when the
      signee has some already signed RFC 2822 UIDs and a freshly added
      attribute, for instance.
    + color ouput ($CONFIG{colors})
    + Prune keys with import-{clean,minimal} not export-{clean,minimal}.
    + Fix $CONFIG{'also-lsign-in-gnupghome'}: local signatures are directly
      imported from caff's GNUPGHOME to our own; in auto-lsign'ing mode, lsign
      UID for which we have an exportable signature (preserving the signer and
      cert level).
    + Pass the 'keyserver-options' specified in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf to
      $CONFIG{keyserver} when it is left unset.
  * gpgsigs:
    + Add a legend with the different signature types.
    + Mark local signatures as 'L' (formerly they were marked as 'S'), and
      expiring -- but not expired -- signatures as 'x'.
  * caff, pgp-clean, pgp-fixkey, gpg-key2latex, gpg-key2ps, gpg-mailkeys,
    gpgdir, gpgparticipants, gpgsigs, keyart, keylookup:
    + Add the possibility to choose the gpg binary via the "GNUPGBIN"
      environment variable.  (Default: "gpg".)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 16:56:24 UTC 2012 - joop.boonen@opensuse.org

- Build version 1.1.4
   * gpg-key2ps:
     + Apply patch from Uwe Kleine-König to deal with latin1 characters
   * gpg-mailkeys:
     + Correct path of ~/.gpg-mailkeysrc and ~/.signature in manpage.
     + Add new environment variable SENDMAIL_ARGS to allow user to pass
       arguments to sendmail
   * caff:
     + Correct path of ~/.caffrc in informational messages
     + Be more verbose on unexpected key ID
     + Refactor import of own key and import for keys to sign from keyrings.
     + Also automatically import keys to sign from the user's normal gpg
       keyrings.
     + Use --no-auto-check-trustdb when importing keys from files or
       the user's normal gpg keyrings
      + manpage: Refer to all of /usr/share/doc/signing-party/caff/ and not
       just to /usr/share/doc/signing-party/caff/caffrc.sample
     + Fix horrible &function calls used because of broken prototypes.
     + Even if all keys to sign were found in the user's normal gpg
       keyrings we still need to import them (again) from any keyrings
       passed with --key-files - the keys there might be newer, containing
       new subkeys (for encryption), uids (for signing) or revocations.
     + Make importing of keys to be signed from the normal gpg optional
       (--keys-from-gnupg).
     + refactor copying of command line options into global config variable.
     + Create the mail files in ~/.caff/keys even if mail is not sent
