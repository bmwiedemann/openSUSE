  eBPF backend extensions, easier access to examples, adapting to
  meltdown/spectre complications, real-time / high-cpu-count
  concurrency fixes

- Remove patches, because the issues were fixed upstream:
    systemtap-change-extra_cflags-escape-processing.patch 

- Adjust patch for version 3.3:
    systemtap-build-source-dir.patch

- Added public key of "Frank Ch. Eigler <fche@elastic.org>",

- Created new specfile systemtap-headers.spec, so bootstrap cycles
  packages can use them without blowing up the cycle.
