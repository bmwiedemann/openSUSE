# The git repo is a hodgepodge.
# Most recent tag is 1.5.4, but that is outdated.
# CMakeLists.txt's project() line contains 1.5.5, but this is outdated too.
# The SPIR-V version is 1.6.4 (include/spirv/unified1/spirv.core.grammar.json)
# They add "SDK" tags that reflect the Vulkan version (1.3),
# and the independently increasing toolchain release number (296).

# Leap 15 and SLES 15 defaults to GCC 7, which does not have stable C++17 ABI.
