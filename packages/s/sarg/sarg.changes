  - Store the IP address in the per user limit file (thanks to xeus)
- Changes from 2.3.5

- Changes from 2.3.4
  - Fix an error occurring when several user names contain at least two
    consecutive non-alphanumeric characters. In that case, the mangled

    this bug
  - Remove a warning about the redirector file that can't be deleted
    when it is not created.
- Changes from 2.3.3

    conditions that are involved in the creation of a report, that
    help is welcome
  - Fix the report generation if users_sites is disabled
  - Avoid a possible name clash among the temporary files if a user
    happens to have the same name as one of the files sarg generates
  - Fix various links and reports when some options are disabled
  - Accept regular expressions in the hostalias file
  - URL in SquidGuard logs sometimes don't have a scheme. This is now
    handled properly
  - Exclude hosts based on the IPv4 address even if a port number is
    suffixed after the IP address (thanks to Mark Easter for
    reporting the bug)
  - IP addresses can be resolved to host names using an external program
  - Limit the maximum line length read from the input log to avoid
    consuming all the memory when reading a corrupted or invalid file.
    The limit is set to 10MB per line
  - Protect the temporary directory against unsafe deletion (if the
    temporary path is set to a wrong location, sarg won't blindly
    wipe the directory)
  - The smartfilter might be fixed (I need test logs to validate this
    change. If you have some, please send them to fmarchal at
    users.sourceforge.net)
  - The top sites report can be sorted according to the number of
    users who visited each site
  - The two options --convert and --split can read the log file from
    stdin
  - Display execution statistics with --statistics. Only useful to
    test for regressions during development

    to dynamically sort some tables (thanks to Éric).

    reports to keep or to keep all the reports respectively (thanks to Emmanuel 
    Lacour for the suggestion).
  - Report the user ID in the e-mail report.
  - Add an option to sort the top sites by time.
  - Delete unused files from the directory containing the user report 
    (thanks to alf-man).
  - Add the index_fields option to hide the directory size column in the index 
    sorted by date.
  - Split the input log file in several files each containing one day worth of 
    data (thanks to Mauricio Silveira).
  - Take the date_format into account when converting a log file.
  - Accept IPv6 addresses in the realtime report.
  - Don't fail for an empty report directory when building the index.
  - Fix a read error when parsing the time of a common log format 
    (thanks to Richard P Scott).
  - Use anonymous file and directory names in the report to hide the identity of 
    the user whose report is displayed and shorten the total path length.
  - More robust calls to external sort commands (guard against buffer overflows 
    and use tab as column separator).
  - Replace host names by aliases and group identicaly aliased host names.
  - IPv6 is accepted in the hosts exclusion list.
  - Discriminate between users whose name produce the same mangled temporary 
    file name.
  - Write a note about the number of entries ignored in the reports (thanks 
    to Iain Lopata).

    are not generated due to the configuration.

- Remove obsolete patches
- Add english to sarg-report
- Add suse logo to report index
- Improved default config
- Add apache configuration
- Version 2.2.7
   * Extra compile and run time protection (FORTIFY_SOURCE) fixed
     in configure.
   * Use tabulations as columns separator in intermediary files
     to avoid problems when a field of the log contains a space.
   * Input log file type detection partly rewritten to clearly
     distinguish which type is processed where.
   * Read the input log file from standard input if log file name
     is -.
   * Use string pointers in getword instead of copying the
     strings over and over.
   * Use LC_TIME to format some dates and times in the report
     according to the selected locale.
   * Sarg.conf can list up to 255 access.log files.
   * Downloaded files suffixes are matched against a sorted list
     and use a dichotomic search.
   * Added getword_atoll to read a number directly from a file
     without an intermediary string storage.
   * Use boolean to enable the options instead of string
     compares.
   * Accept an absolute path for the language file in sarg.conf.
   * Experimental: Can show the backtrace of the program when a
     getword loop is detected to help in locating the origin of
     the error.
   * Protect the creation of the index against invalid
     directories.
   * Only copy the files (not the subdirs) when creating the
     directory with the images to include in the reports.
   * Directories deleted without using the rm system command.
   * Index created using an internal sort algorithm instead of a
     system call.
   * Fixed Debian bug #408577 (changed exclude_hosts to exclude
     subdomains and IPv4 subnets).
   * Replace --enable-htmldir by --enable-sargphp to avoid
     confusion on the name (thanks to Peter Nixon).
   * Installation of sarg-php can be disabled with
     --disable-sargphp.
   * Fixed empty entries in squidGuard log when the URL doesn't
     start with protocol://.
   * Fixed regressions in creation and reading of a sarg parsed
     log (thanks to Joao Alves).
   * Does not report URLs consisting of only a host name ending
     with .com as a downloaded file.
   * Mangle the $ and @ signs in user ID to make the resulting
     file name valid in shell commands.
   * Fixed a regression in the default value of --enable-sargphp.
   * Increase the maximum size of a line read from access.log and
     detect longer lines that were silently splitted in previous
     versions.
   * Tolerate longer URLs during the reading of the access.log to
     have less chances of aborting during that phase. It only
     helps if short URLs are output in the reports. If long_url is set, sarg will
     still abort on over sized URLs.

  * previous reports info wrong in index.html
  * gd graph font change from FreeSans.ttf to DejaVuSans.ttf

    does not find the log-files anymore.
  * after reading the squidGuard configuration, the data read from
    the usertab file was corrupted.
  * milisec values showed as bytes.
  * with squidGuard, you can log groups in only one log file. We
    must parse each log files only one time.
  * error message(removetmp) Cannot open /tmp/sarg_tmp/../general
    when sending report by email.
  * incorrect off_t size in printf. In FreeBSD off_t is 64bit long
    long, but sarg always use %d to display off_t in log
    processing. This cause garbage while reading log files on a
    freebsd, and possible crash.
  * squid24 on/off tag added in sarg.conf to implement
    compatibility if using squid <= 2.4 and using squid common
    logs.

  * if all the data is at the hour each day, totaliza_day() treates
    it all as being on the last day. This is observed for users
    which only download via a cron job at the same time each day.
    Now the date and time will be checked to see if changed.
  * greport_day() doesn't add the volume for the first hour of each
    day to the total.
  * Russian_koi8 and Russian_windows1251 languages updated by Stas
    Degteff <stas.grumbler@gmail.com>. Many thanks
