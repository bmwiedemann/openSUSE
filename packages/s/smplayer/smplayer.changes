  where @@DEFAULT@@ was replaced with alsa/pulse were fetched from
  the wrong patch file...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  6 00:21:36 UTC 2015 - wbauer@tmo.at

Thu May  7 16:16:32 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 14.9.0.6887:
 * Add the options -ontop and -no-ontop for the command line.
   They just change the "Stay on top" options in the preferences.
 * Add an option in the toolbar editor to set the size of the
   icons (currently it doesn't look good if you increase the size
   of the icons in the skin GUI).
 * Add new option in the playlist section in preferences:
   "Play next file even if the previous file failed".
   If the option is enabled, when a file fails to play (MPV/mplayer
   crashes or exits with an error code), the playlist will play
   the next file in the list.
 * Allow duplicate items in the playlist.
 * New action show_time (assigned by default to key I). It shows
   the current playback time, total time and percentage, for 2
   seconds on the OSD.
 * Now the following filters do not restart MPV when they are
   turned on/off: add black borders, gradfun, add noise, software
   scaling, blur, sharpen, deblock, dering, denoise, phase, rotate,
   and deinterlace.
 * The flip and mirror options don't restart MPV.
 * Change the play/pause icon according to the player state in the
   default and mini GUIs.
 * The kerndeint filter works with MPV.
 * Add the possibility to use the mouse buttons for the actions
   "next chapter" and "previous chapter".
 * Add the possibility to delete a file in the playlist from the
   filesystem.
 * Add support for MPRIS D-Bus Interface.
 * (mpv) Use the --sub-text-* options to set the style of the
   subtitles since the option --ass-styles doesn't work anymore for
   this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  5 10:14:02 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 14.9.0.6690:
  * Open https URLs with ffmpeg://
  * (Themes and skins) Now if the resource file (*.rcc) is not
    found the images will be loaded from PNGs files, as in previous
    versions.
    This will make easier for users to customize themes, since they
    won't need to create the rcc files.
  * (Qt 5) Fix the option pause when minimized.
  * Add options in Preferences -> Network to set a proxy.
  * (Bugfix) Prevent to pass the filename twice to mplayer when
    using use_short_pathnames.
  * Add support for mpv.
    It took 25 days. 6983 lines were changed.
    It's not complete yet, some things may not work yet, but
    I think the most important things work.
    Notice: it requires mpv 0.6.2 or greater.
  * During the process of adding support for mpv, the options to
    customize the non ASS font were removed.
  * Add the Albanian translation.
  * Add Notes_about_mpv.txt.
  * Add an option to go back one frame (frame_back_step)
    (mpv only).
  * Add an option in Preferences -> General to set the template for
    screenshots (mpv only).
  * Replace the option 'Use SSA/ASS library' in the subtitles menu
    with 'Use custom style'.
  * Add an option to disable the scroll of the title in the
    skingui.
  * Add the possibility to select a secondary subtitle track, which
    is displayed on top of the screen (mpv only).
  * Move the Youtube options from the performance section to the
    network section.
  * Add an option to enable or disable the internal Youtube
    support.
  * Add an option to enable streaming sites (requires mpv and
    youtube-dl).
  * Add an option to change the size of the OSD.
  * (Videopreview) Use -nofontconfig to prevent to create the font
    cache.
  * Fix for Youtube.
  * (mpv) Don't use the pp filter if it's not available 
  * Add a combobox in Preferences -> Performance to select the
    hardware decoding option (mpv only).
- Rebase smplayer-default_ao.patch, smplayer-simple-resize.patch.
- Add smplayer-default_mpv.patch, require MPV instead of MPlayer.

  stop adding translated GPLv2+ text into the package.

  QMAKE_OPTS=DEFINES+=NO_DEBUG_ON_CONSOLE
