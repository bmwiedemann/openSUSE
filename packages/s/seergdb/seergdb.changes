* Upgrade to v2.5.
* Console now supports a subset of ANSI color codes.
* Console can be started in these modes:
  - Detached
  - Detached and minimized
  - Attached in Seer's tab view (with gdb logs and seer logs).
* Improved handling of \n \t and other escaped characters in gdb log window.
* Show breakpoint info as a tooltip if the breakpoint icon is clicked with
* LMB and held down.
* Show stack as a hex dump, with options to view as short, int, long, ascii, ...
* The "go to address" in the Assembly view now works if address it outside
  current assembly view.
* Visualizers can take a gdb expression for input fields for
  length/size of something. The visualizers are:
  - ArrayVisualizer
  - ImageVisualizer
  - MemoryVisualizer
* Fixed regression when setting/saving the editor font setting.
* Fixed bug when the Basic Struct visualizer display simple variable
  types (non-structs).
* Source all files in ~/.config/seergdb/scripts/ on startup.
* Fixed regression handling ignoring of system header files.
* Fixed regression when adding commands to a breakpoint.
* Refactored/improved Printpoints. Added 'help' to the
* Printpoint create dialog.

  the text in the editor window.

Wed May 22 19:35:21 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Upgrade to v2.4:
  * Changed main icon to a more license friendly one.
  * All icons are now GPLv3, CC3.0, or CC4.0
  * Fixed string compares for breakpoint conditions
  * Added '--bs' command line option to specify a breakpoint at a
    source.cpp:lineno
  * Fixed long tooltips text by restricting them to 100 characters.
  * The text in the various viewing dialogs is still the full length.
  * The 100 limit probably needs to be configurable.
  * Added register profiles to show only interesting/relevant registers.
  * Added UTF-8,16,32 support in the Memory Visualizer.
  * Added an internal "dark" and "light" theme via the View->Style menu.
  * Added option to open the current source file in an external editor.

- Upgrade to v2.2:
  * Small RR release. Seer now runs 'rr replay' internally.
  * Fixed infinite loop when starting with RR mode.
  * Reworked RR mode to directly run 'rr replay'.
    No need to start a 'rr server' and connect to it.
  * Fixed Source handling in source browser.
    Qt5 mode was broken.
    Qt6 works. Directory paths need a tailing "/*".
- Fix build for openSUSE 15.5.
  Changed from the default gcc version (7) to gcc 12, since it
  supports C++17.
- Remove doubly declared files in the spec, removing some warnings.
- Add missing "Group" information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Aug 23 21:13:06 UTC 2023 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Upgrade to v2.1:
  * Add Execution dialog to record breakpoint events. This solves the
    problem of too many break/error dialogs to "swat away" as the
    program is debugged.
  * Add a method to add/change gdb commands to execute when a
    breakpoint (breakpoint, watchpoint, catchpoint) is reached.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's condition command.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's ignore count.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's command list.
  * Debug dialog for "attach" mode now detects executable name and
    path from /proc//exe.
  * Commandline for "attach" mode now detects executable name and path
    from /proc//exe.
