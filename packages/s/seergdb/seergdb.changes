Wed May 22 19:35:21 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Upgrade to v2.4:
  * Changed main icon to a more license friendly one.
  * All icons are now GPLv3, CC3.0, or CC4.0
  * Fixed string compares for breakpoint conditions
  * Added '--bs' command line option to specify a breakpoint at a
    source.cpp:lineno
  * Fixed long tooltips text by restricting them to 100 characters.
  * The text in the various viewing dialogs is still the full length.
  * The 100 limit probably needs to be configurable.
  * Added register profiles to show only interesting/relevant registers.
  * Added UTF-8,16,32 support in the Memory Visualizer.
  * Added an internal "dark" and "light" theme via the View->Style menu.

- Upgrade to v2.2:
  * Small RR release. Seer now runs 'rr replay' internally.
  * Fixed infinite loop when starting with RR mode.
  * Reworked RR mode to directly run 'rr replay'.
    No need to start a 'rr server' and connect to it.
  * Fixed Source handling in source browser.
    Qt5 mode was broken.
    Qt6 works. Directory paths need a tailing "/*".
- Fix build for openSUSE 15.5.
  Changed from the default gcc version (7) to gcc 12, since it
  supports C++17.
- Remove doubly declared files in the spec, removing some warnings.
- Add missing "Group" information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 26 13:46:17 UTC 2023 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

Wed Aug 23 21:13:06 UTC 2023 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Upgrade to v2.1:
  * Add Execution dialog to record breakpoint events. This solves the
    problem of too many break/error dialogs to "swat away" as the
    program is debugged.
  * Add a method to add/change gdb commands to execute when a
    breakpoint (breakpoint, watchpoint, catchpoint) is reached.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's condition command.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's ignore count.
  * Add a method to add/change a breakpoint's command list.
  * Debug dialog for "attach" mode now detects executable name and
    path from /proc//exe.
  * Commandline for "attach" mode now detects executable name and path
    from /proc//exe.
