  <title>Stream Analyzer</title>
  <description>Stan is a small console application that works on all UNIX systems. It
is able to generate several types of statistical information about a
stream. A stream can be either standard input or given files. For
example, stan can be used to analyze encrypted data or to measure the
quality of a pseudo-random number generator, but there are probably
hundreds of other situations where stan comes in handy.

Stan supports three types of analysis: general statistics, pattern
statistics, and bit statistics. By choosing intelligent values for each
statistic, stan can give amazing results about a stream and is fun to
work with.</description>
