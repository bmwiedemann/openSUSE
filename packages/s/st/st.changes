Mon Jun 22 09:14:45 UTC 2020 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.8.4

  Security
  --------

  * config.def.h: add an option allowwindowops, by default off (secure).

    Similar to the xterm AllowWindowOps option.
    The sequence for base64-encoded clipboard copy is now guarded and off by
    default because it allows a sequence written to the terminal to manipulate the
    clipboard of the (other) running user non-interactively.

  Features
  --------

  * Integrate auto-sync: draw on idle to avoid flicker/tearing by avih.
    st could easily tear/flicker with animation or other unattended
    output. This commit eliminates most of the tear/flicker.

  * Optimize column width calculation and UTF-8 encode for the common-case ASCII.
    In particular on glibc and OpenBSD the wcwidth() call is more expensive.
    On musl there is no/little difference.

  * Add support for REP (repeat) escape sequence and xterm compatibility, by
    avih.  The capability is not exposed yet due to some issues with
    applications.

  * Call xsetcursor to set win.cursor in main, by Steve Ward.
    Allowing to set the st snowman cursor extension dynamically.

  Fixes and other changes
  -----------------------

  * Fix unicode glitch in DCS strings, by Tim Allen.
    The related sixel stub code is now removed also.

  * Fix for incorrect (partial) written sequences when libc wcwidth() == -1
    and using st -o.

  * Mouse selection fixes, by Jakub

  * Make shift+wheel behaves as shift+Prev/Next, patch by k0ga
    This patch adds a new hack, making shift+wheel returning the
    same sequences than shift+Prev/Next, meaning that scroll or
    any other similar program will not be able to differentiate
    between them.

  * Expose rin terminfo capability.
    Tianlin Qu discovered that st is missing rin (scroll back #1 lines).

  * Replace exit(3) by _exit(2) in signal handler sigchld(), by Jan.
    This change prevents st to crash and dump core in some situations.

  * FAQ: add details and a patch example for single-buffering (for the w3mimg
    hack).
