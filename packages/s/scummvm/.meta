  <title>Interpreter for LucasArts games</title>
  <description>ScummVM is an implementation of the LucasArts SCUMM (Script Creation
Utility for Maniac Mansion) interpreter, used in games such as Monkey
Island and Day of the Tentacle. Some things are still missing in a few
games, and there are a few bugs. Regardless, it is possible to play
some games all the way through to the end.

At the moment there is support for the following games:

Zak McCracken and the Alien Mindbenders (FM Towns version) Loom
(256-color CD version) The Secret of Monkey Island (VGA CD version)
Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge Indiana Jones and the Fate of
Atlantis (demo and full version) Day of the Tentacle (demo and full
version) Sam &amp; Max (demo and full version) Simon the Sorcerer

There is also experimental support for these games:

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (VGA version) The Secret of Monkey
Island (VGA floppy disk version) Full Throttle The DIG

If you are a fan of Sierra On-Line adventure games you might want to
try the 'sarien' and 'freesci' packages.
