  <description>File::StripNondeterminism is a Perl module for stripping bits of
non-deterministic information, such as timestamps and file system
order, from files such as gzipped files, ZIP archives, and Jar files.
It can be used as a post-processing step to make a build reproducible,
when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.  It is used
as part of the Reproducible Builds project.

strip-nondeterminism contains the File::StripNondeterminism Perl module, 
and the strip-nondeterminism command line utility.</description>
