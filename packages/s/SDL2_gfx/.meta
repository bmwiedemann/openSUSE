  <title>SDL Graphics Routines for Primitives and Other Support Functions</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'SDL_gfx' from project 'openSUSE:Factory'.

The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code which
provided basic drawing routines such as lines, circles or polygons and
SDL_rotozoom which implemented a interpolating rotozoomer for SDL
surfaces.
