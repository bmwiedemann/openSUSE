  <title>SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) Scanner Drivers</title>
  <description>The software consists of SANE scanner drivers, &quot;scanimage,&quot; and the
&quot;saned&quot; daemon.

A SANE scanner driver is used via a SANE front-end. This package
contains the command line front-end &quot;scanimage&quot;. There are various
graphical front-ends like &quot;xscanimage&quot; (package sane-frontends), XSane
(package xsane), and the KDE front-end Kooka (package
kdegraphics3-scan).

The &quot;saned&quot; daemon provides the service &quot;sane-port&quot; to access scanners
that are connected to a server via network from client hosts that run
the &quot;net&quot; meta driver.</description>
