%description
The software consists of SANE scanner drivers,
"scanimage," and the "saned" daemon.

A SANE scanner driver is used via a SANE front-end.
This package contains the command line front-end "scanimage".
There are graphical front-ends in other packages like
XSane (package xsane), Skanlite for KDE4 (package skanlite),
and Kooka for KDE3 (package kdegraphics3-scan).

The "saned" daemon provides the service "sane-port"
to access scanners that are connected to a server
via network from client hosts that run the "net" meta driver.

%description autoconfig
USB scanner autoconfiguration happens via udev.

The file /udev/rules.d/56-sane-backends-autoconfig.rules contains
entries for those USB scanners where the USB IDs are known, which are
supported by a free driver, where the support status is "complete" or
"good", and which do not require firmware upload.

When a USB scanner is connected and its USB IDs match to an entry in
the 56-sane-backends-autoconfig.rules file, the matching scanner driver
is activated (i.e. the driver line in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf is
activated).

It enables scanner drivers but never disables them. The reason is that
enabled drivers do not hurt so that an automated disable would make it
only overcomplicated because when more than one scanner uses the same
driver, a complicated check would be needed to avoid that the driver is
accidentally disabled when only one scanner was disconnected.

If you do not like automated driver activation, do not install this
package or remove it when it is already installed.

# the group must be "lp" so that the CUPS usb backend which runs
# as user "lp" (who is member of the group "lp") can send printing data
# to the printer unit (i.e. the printer interface of the USB device).
# It is sufficiently secure and reasonable easy to use by default
# the same group "lp" for printers and scanners because both kind of devices
# usually require physical user access (to get the printed paper or
