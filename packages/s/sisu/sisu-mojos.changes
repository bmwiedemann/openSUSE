- Upgrade to upstream milestone 0.9.0.M4
  * Most important change
    + ASM is "demoted" to plain dependency, hence, consumer is able
      to override/update it the usual "Maven way". This applies to
      all components: inject, plexus and sisu-maven-plugin as well.
    + Historically, Sisu shaded in ASM just like Guice did. Later
      Sisu started shipping "main" JAR with shaded ASM but also
      "no_asm" classified artifact without ASM (just like Guice did
      with  "classes" classified JAR). Starting from this version,
      Sisu does not shade ASM anymore, it is "demoted" to transitive
      dependency.
  * Changes
    + Disable shallow clones for sonarcloud analysis
    + Remove spurious asserts
    + Post release cleanup
    + Fix jacoco + code coverage
    + Enable code coverage again for all modules
    + Use default property for the jacoco agent

    + Remove about.html as only relevant for Eclipse plugins
    + Document Lifecycle support
    + Call TypeAwareExpressionEvaluator.evaluate(String,Class) if
      available
    + Pass strict flag also via "discoverComponents"
    + Embed/relocate ASM via m-shade-p
    + Update to ASM 9.8
    + Increase coverage
    + Align subproject names (and naming)
    + Build infra updates
    + Reproducible
    + Fix sisu-maven-plugin
    + Lax array converter
    + Update dependencies
    + Publishing to Central
