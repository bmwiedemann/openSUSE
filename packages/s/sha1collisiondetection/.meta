  <title>Command line tool to detect SHA-1 collision in a file</title>
  <description>This command line tool was designed as near drop-in replacements for sha1sum
implementation. It will compute the SHA-1 hash of any given file and additionally
will detect cryptanalytic collision attacks against SHA-1 present in each file.
It is very fast and takes less than twice the amount of time as regular SHA-1.
