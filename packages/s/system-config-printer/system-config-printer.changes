-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 31 10:20:19 UTC 2018 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Add 0001-Fallback-to-using-LC_CTYPE-if-LC_MESSAGES-is-empty-a.patch.
  This fixes an error message when adding a new printer since the code
  was finding out the language by using LC_MESSAGES which wasn't set
  and then it was extracting the first element of a None value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 08:28:28 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add system-config-printer-no-simple-gui.patch: Remove _simple_gui

- Add Require python(3)?-gobject-Gdk: pygobject was further split
  in order to be able to install it without X-dependencies. We
  import Gdk from gi.repository, thus also require

Fri May  6 15:57:52 UTC 2016 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Add fix_connect_dialog_focus.diff: Enable the focus on the text

  can edit its content and write the ip of the remote cups server
  to connect to (gh#twaugh/system-config-printer#38).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 22 10:11:53 UTC 2016 - alarrosa@suse.com

Tue Sep  6 21:35:44 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Split the main subpackage in various smaller subpackages, to
  enable more fine-grained dependencies (gnome-control-center only
  needs the dbus service, and we don't want to force people to
  install the whole system-config-printer in that case):
  - Create common subpackage that contains files common to more
    than one subpackage.
  - Create applet subpackage that contains the notification icon
    monitoring printing stuff when the user is logged in.
  - Create dbus-service subpackage that contains the dbus service.
  - Rename lang subpackage to common-lang, so that it gets
    installed with the common subpackage.
  - Make all those subpackages depend on the common subpackage, for
    obvious reasons.
  - Add other dependencies between those subpackages:
    . Add applet subpackage Recommends to main subpackage: it makes
      sense to have the applet if the main tool is installed.

    tools.

  configuration file to python-cupshelpers, where it really
  belongs (since this is where the dbus server is implemented).

- Update to version 1.1.4 (this is not a complete list of changes
  since upstream uses git, but some changes aren't listed in
  ChangeLog):
  + Don't display status icon for completed jobs
  + Only add job to the active set if it is active; otherwise,
    remove it from the set if it is there.

    status icon.
  + Handle D-Bus failures when connecting to the session bus
    (Jockey) (rh#484402)

    require an authentication dialog and we don't want them

    keyboard and pointer for that dialog and instead let the window

    constraint checking is symmetrical.

  + Added functionality to automatically recognize whether the
    proprietary plug-in of HPLIP is useful or even required and to

  + Fixed "hp-info" calls: There should be no space between "-d"
    and the "URI" to work around HPLIP option parsing bug.
  + Return None if the "fax-type" is 0, this means that fax is not
    available on the given printer.
  + Fixed switch between the notification for the case that a queue
    got created and the case that no queue got created.
  + Perform lowercase operations in locale-independent manner.
  + Merge cups-pk-helper branch.
  + Updated translations.

  browsing smb printers. Should fix bnc#433994.

    for system-config-printer to use cups-pk-helper to do the CUPS
    calls.

  reached on this so far. The patch is not intrusive, so it's the
  best solution right now. I'll try to push it again upstream.
