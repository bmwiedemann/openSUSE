Fri Dec 23 20:47:37 UTC 2022 - Herbert Graeber <herbert@graeber-clan.de>

- Update to version 1.2
  * Fixed incorrect button mappings for the SpaceMouse Pro. The button remapping
    which was designed to fix this in v1.1 would end up becoming disabled due to
    an incorrect assumption about reported number of buttons.
  * Fixed incorrect number of stop bits for serial magellan spacemice. Some devices
    tolerated that, while others did not work.
  * Improved compatibility with some serial spaceballs. Relaxed the device matching
    condition and allowed some time for the device to boot up before initializing it.
  * Added hardcoded "reasonable" default values for number of axes and buttons in
    the incomplete FreeBSD USB device handling code, to stop it from reporting 0 axes
    and freaking clients out.  This is a stop-gap, eventually it needs to be
    implemented correctly.

- Add example files to package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 25 16:30:12 UTC 2022 - Herbert Graeber <herbert@graeber-clan.de>

- Update to version 1.1
  * fixed incorrect number of buttons reported on SpaceMouse Pro and SpaceMouse
    Enterprise.
  * fixed non-contiguous button numbers on SpaceMouse Pro and SpaceMouse Enterprise,
    which could crash spnavcfg.
  * linux evdev: detect button base offset, instead of hardcoding 256 (BN_MISC),
    which fixes incorrect button numbers on the Magellan SpaceMouse USB.
  * fixed crash when attempting to save configuration (save command received from
    the client socket), and a configuration file does not already exist.
  * linux hotplug: use delayed activation to avoid multiple hotplug triggers and
    the resulting log spam.
  * reduced logging on the "verbose" setting. Now accepting multiple -v arguments
    for maximum verbosity.
  * fixed compatibility with newer 3dconnexion SDK clients.
  * fixed libm link omission, which broke the build on systems where isfinite is not
    a macro to a compiler built-in (BSD libc).
  * Added example configuration files with reasonable button mappings for the
    SpacePilot and the SpaceMouse Enterprise under doc/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 13:33:52 UTC 2022 - Herbert Graeber <herbert@graeber-clan.de> 1.0

- Update to version 1.0
  * Implemented hugely improved spacenav protocol v1. It includes future
     expandability provisions, and adds support for a wealth of new capabilities
     for clients, including:
     + device information queries (number of buttons and axes, device identification...).
     + configuration management (allows configuration tools like spnavcfg to be
       regular clients without special priviledges).
     + new events, with event selection mechanism (device change, config change,
       raw axis, raw button).
  * Improved configuration file handling. Spacenavd now saves changes to the file,
    and does so while retaining user changes, including comments and empty lines,
    and modifying existing lines when possible.
  * Added device level axis remapping (non-configurable), to normalize axis
    assignments across all known devices, to avoid having to change the configuration
    every time a different device is connected.
  * Added initial USB device support on FreeBSD.
  * Added the ability to bind buttons to actions like sensitivity changes or axis muting.
  * Added XTEST support for keyboard event injection, which works much more reliably.
    Falls back to XSendEvent if XTEST is unavailable.
  * Fixed serial magellan spacemouse compatibility over USB-serial converters with the PL2303 UART.
  * Added --cfgdir= build option, to change the configuration file directory.
  * Fixed MacOS X build.
  * Fixed LED staying on on startup if it was configured otherwise.
  * Fixed inconsistent handling of the logging method selection arguments.
  * Fixed spacenavd terminating with SIGPIPE when clients disconnected ungracefully.
  * Build fixes and improvements.

  * Rewrote the serial spaceball code from scratch, to support both spaceball
    and magellan spacemice.
  * Fixed non-X11 build which was broken in the previous version.
  * Print usage information when encountering an invalid argument, instead of
    just printing "invalid argument".
