- Add example files to package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 25 16:30:12 UTC 2022 - Herbert Graeber <herbert@graeber-clan.de>

- Update to version 1.1
  * fixed incorrect number of buttons reported on SpaceMouse Pro and SpaceMouse
    Enterprise.
  * fixed non-contiguous button numbers on SpaceMouse Pro and SpaceMouse Enterprise,
    which could crash spnavcfg.
  * linux evdev: detect button base offset, instead of hardcoding 256 (BN_MISC),
    which fixes incorrect button numbers on the Magellan SpaceMouse USB.
  * fixed crash when attempting to save configuration (save command received from
    the client socket), and a configuration file does not already exist.
  * linux hotplug: use delayed activation to avoid multiple hotplug triggers and
    the resulting log spam.
  * reduced logging on the "verbose" setting. Now accepting multiple -v arguments
    for maximum verbosity.
  * fixed compatibility with newer 3dconnexion SDK clients.
  * fixed libm link omission, which broke the build on systems where isfinite is not
    a macro to a compiler built-in (BSD libc).
  * Added example configuration files with reasonable button mappings for the
    SpacePilot and the SpaceMouse Enterprise under doc/.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 13:33:52 UTC 2022 - Herbert Graeber <herbert@graeber-clan.de> 1.0

- Update to version 1.0
  * Implemented hugely improved spacenav protocol v1. It includes future
     expandability provisions, and adds support for a wealth of new capabilities
     for clients, including:
     + device information queries (number of buttons and axes, device identification...).
     + configuration management (allows configuration tools like spnavcfg to be
       regular clients without special priviledges).
     + new events, with event selection mechanism (device change, config change,
       raw axis, raw button).
  * Improved configuration file handling. Spacenavd now saves changes to the file,
    and does so while retaining user changes, including comments and empty lines,
    and modifying existing lines when possible.
  * Added device level axis remapping (non-configurable), to normalize axis
    assignments across all known devices, to avoid having to change the configuration
    every time a different device is connected.
  * Added initial USB device support on FreeBSD.
  * Added the ability to bind buttons to actions like sensitivity changes or axis muting.
  * Added XTEST support for keyboard event injection, which works much more reliably.
    Falls back to XSendEvent if XTEST is unavailable.
  * Fixed serial magellan spacemouse compatibility over USB-serial converters with the PL2303 UART.
  * Added --cfgdir= build option, to change the configuration file directory.
  * Fixed MacOS X build.
  * Fixed LED staying on on startup if it was configured otherwise.
  * Fixed inconsistent handling of the logging method selection arguments.
  * Fixed spacenavd terminating with SIGPIPE when clients disconnected ungracefully.
  * Build fixes and improvements.

    and magellan spacemice.

    where commited accidentally previously
  * moved axis remapping before checking deadzones
  * trying to remove devices from Xinput
  * added all the missing options to the example-spnavrc file
