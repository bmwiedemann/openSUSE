  <description>SVG Cleaner could help you to clean up your SVG files from unnecessary data. It has a lot of options for cleanup and optimization, works in batch mode, provides threaded processing on the multicore processors and basically does two things:
- removing elements and attributes that don't contribute to the final rendering;
- making those elements and attributes in use more compact.</description>
