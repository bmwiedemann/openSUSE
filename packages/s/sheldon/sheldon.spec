%description
Sheldon is a fast, configurable, command-line tool to manage your shell plugins.

How does it work?

Plugins are specified in a TOML configuration file and Sheldon renders an install script using user configurable templates.

A ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc that uses Sheldon simply contains the following.

eval "$(sheldon source)"
Sheldon can manage GitHub or Git repositories, Gists, arbitrary remote scripts or binaries, local plugins, and inline plugins.
Plugins are installed and updated in parallel and as a result Sheldon is blazingly fast.
