- Update to version 4.0.0
  * The pdk15 backend now passes the regression tests (both with
    and without --stack-auto), and is thus considered stable.
  * New in-development pdk13 backend for Padauk µC with 13-bit
    wide program memory.
  * C2X memccpy(), strdup(), strndup().
  * Better tail call optimization.
  * Many fixes in the pic14 backend.
  * C2X u8 character constants.
  * C2X bool, static_assert, alignof, alignas.
  * C2X attributes on statements.
  * C2X attribute declarations.

  potential buffer overflow.
- Add sdcc-pcode.patch to fix a strict aliasing warning and remove
  -fno-strict-aliasing from CFLAGS.
- Remove executable bits from source files to make rpmlint happy.

Mon Nov 18 22:32:42 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 3.9.0
  * Support for struct / union assignment.
  * Optimizations in the stm8 backend relevant to soft float increase
    Whetstone score by two thirds.
  * Improvements in rematerialization in the stm8 backend improve code
    generation for struct, union and arrays.
  * New stack allocator reduces stack space usage for the stm8, z80, z180,
    gbz80, r2k, r3ka, tlcs90 backends.
  * New ez80_z80 backend for eZ80 in Z80 mode.
  * Removed deprecated sdcclib utility.
  * New pdk14 backend for Padauk µC with 14-bit wide program memory.
  * New in-development pdk15 backend for Padauk µC with 15-bit wide program
    memory.
- Update to version 3.8.0
  * Additional general utility function: bsearch().
  * Support for rematerialization in the stm8 backend reduces register
    pressure and stack usage.
  * Merged upstream GNU binutils 2.30
  * All Python code is now fully compatible with both Python 2.7 and
    Python 3.6, so Python 3 can be used instead of Python 2.
  * Regression testing for diagnostics.
  * Improved handling of local bool variables in the mcs51 backend
    substantially reduces code size.
  * Large memory model for stm8 for 24-bit codespace allows using more
    than 32KB of Flash for code.
  * New optimizations for calls to some standard library function
    (printf(), puts(), strcpy()).
  * The type of true and false from stdbool.h change from int to bool.
  * New C2X mode (--std-c2x, --std-sdcc2x, #pragma std_c2x) adds support
    for one-argument static_assert variant.
  * Intermingling of declarations and statements (ISO C99).
  * Support headers for AX8052 devices.
  * Adopted GCC 8.2 regression tests (execute part of the GCC C torture tests)
- Update to version 3.7.0
  * Changed putchar() prototype from void putchar(char) to int putchar(int)
    to improve standard-compliance and allow error reporting.
  * Various speed improvements in stm8 backend - Dhrystone score more than
    doubled, resulting in SDCC achieving the highest Dhrystone scores
    among STM8 C implementations.
  * Various speed improvements for multiplications resulting in SDCC achieving
    the highest Coremark scores among STM8 C implementations.
  * Declarations in for loops (ISO C99).
  * 64-bit integers (long long) for the mcs51 and ds390 backends (now long long
    is fully supported in SDCC except for the pic14 and pic16 backends).
  * Full _Bool support for mcs51 and ds390 backend (now _Bool is fully
    supported in SDCC regardless of backend).
  * Additional wide character library functions: mbstowcs() and wcstombs(),
    btowc() and wctob(), wcscmp(), wcslen().
  * Changed PRNG for rand() from LCG to xorshift to improve speed and quality.
  * Support for Small-C calling convention on the callee side (i.e. function
    definitions with Small-C calling convention).
  * The obsolete macro SDCC (which used to contain the version number encoded
    as an integer) has finally been removed (except for mcs51, where it will
    survive a little bit longer for SiLabs IDE compability).
  * New devices supported by simulator (TLCS-90, and the 517, F380, XC88X,
    DS320 mcs51-variants along with dual-dptr and MDU support).
  * Timer, UART (incl. interrupt) and I/O support in STM8 simulator.
  * Simulator support for banked memory and bit banding.
  * Various simulator improvements: Conditional breakpoints, breakpoints by
    function name from SDCC debug output, OMF input, VCD output, simulator
    interface for simulated program and new operators in expressions.
  * Deprecated --nojtbound and the corresponding pragma.
  * Faster register allocator reduces compilation time by about 25% (does not
    apply to mcs51, ds390 which use a different register allocator).
  * Execution count guessing and use of execution count guesses in stm8
    register allocation improve optimization for code speed.
  * Changed getchar() prototype from char getchar(void) to int getchar(void)
    to improve standard-compliance and allow error reporting.
  * Type qualifiers in array parameters (ISO C99).
  * static in array parameters (ISO C99).
  * Improved support for DWARFv2 debug info in ELF output (stm8, hc08, s08).
  * Various improvements in z80/z180/gbz80/tlcs90/r2k/r3ka code generation,
    in particular for mixed 16-/32-bit code.
  * __z88dk_fastcall function pointer support for --reserve-regs-iy.
  * tlcs90 is now a fully supported backend, no longer work in progress.
  * --data-seg to specify the segment for non-initialized data in the z80,
    z180, gbz80, tlcs90, r2k and r3ka backends.
  * New methods to obtain tree-decompositions of control-flow graphs improve
    compilation time / code-quality trade-off (when SDCC is built with
    support for the treedec library).
  * Additional general utility functions: qsort(), strtol(), strtoul().
