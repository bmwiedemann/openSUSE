    as an integer) has finally been removed (except for mcs51, where it will
    survive a little bit longer for SiLabs IDE compability).
  * New devices supported by simulator (TLCS-90, and the 517, F380, XC88X,
    DS320 mcs51-variants along with dual-dptr and MDU support).

    interface for simulated program and new operators in expressions.
  * Deprecated --nojtbound and the corresponding pragma.
  * Faster register allocator reduces compilation time by about 25% (does not
    apply to mcs51, ds390 which use a different register allocator).
  * Execution count guessing and use of execution count guesses in stm8
    register allocation improve optimization for code speed.

    compilation time / code-quality trade-off (when SDCC is built with
    support for the treedec library).
