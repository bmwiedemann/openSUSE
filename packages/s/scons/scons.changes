Mon Jul  8 21:25:32 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- SCons 4.8.0:
  * GetSConsVersion() added to retrieve the SCons version
  * Python 3.6 support marked as deprecated
    Build with Python 3.11 on Leap.
  * Improved Dump() json format detail
  * Possibly incompatible change: All exceptions during the
    execution of an Action are now returned by value rather than by
    raising an exception, for more consistent behavior.
    With this change, user created Actions should now catch and
    handle expected exceptions (whereas previously many of these
    were silently caught and suppressed by the SCons Action
    exection code).
  * AddOption and the internal add_local_option which AddOption
    calls now recognize a "settable" keyword argument to indicate a
    project-added option can also be modified using SetOption.
    If you were using ninja and using SetOption() for ninja options
    in your SConscripts prior to loading the ninja tool, you will
    now see an error. The fix is to move the SetOption() to after
    you've loaded the ninja tool.
  * Bug fixes and compatible improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  3 19:23:47 CET 2020 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Switch off tests
- Update to 3.1.2 (jsc#SLE-12199, bsc#1169143):
    - Added debug option "action_timestamps" which outputs to
      stdout the absolute start and end time for each target.
    - Fix suncxx tool (Oracle Studio compiler) when using Python 3.
      Previously would throw an exception.
      Resolved by properly handling tool version string output as
      unicode.
    - Resolved a typo in engine.SCons.Tool
    - Resolved a race condition in multithreaded Windows builds
      with Python 2 in the case where a child process is spawned
      while a Python action has a file open. Original author:
      Ryan Beasley.
    - Added memoization support for calls to Environment.Value()
      in order to improve performance of repeated calls.
    - Update Command() function to accept target_scanner,
      source_factory, and target_factory arguments.
      This makes Command act more like a one-off builder.
    - Added support for "-imacros" to ParseFlags
    - Fix CheckFunc detection code for Visual 2019. Some functions
      (e.g. memmove) were incorrectly recognized as not available.
    - Fix stacktrace when using SCons with Python 3.5+ and
      SunOS/Solaris related tools.	
    - Avoid crash with UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3 when
      a Latex log file in non-UTF-8 encoding (e.g. containing
      umlauts in Latin-1 encoding when the fontenc package is
      included with \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}) is read.
    - Improved threading performance by ensuring NodeInfo is
      shared across threads. Results in ~13% improvement for
      parallel builds (-j# > 1) with many shared nodes.
    - Improve performance of Entry.disambiguate() by making check
      for most common case first, preventing unnecessary IO.
    - Improved DAG walk performance by reducing unnecessary work
      when there are no un-visited children.
    - Replace instances of string find method with "in" checks
      where the index from find() was not used.
    - CmdStringHolder fix from issue #3428
    - Turn previously deprecated debug options into failures:
      --debug=tree, --debug=dtree, --debug=stree,
      --debug=nomemoizer.
    - Experimental New Feature: Enable caching MSVC configuration
      If SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG shell environment variable is
      set, SCons will cache the results of past calls to
      vcvarsall.bat to a file; integrates with existing memoizing
      of such vars. On vs2019 saves 5+ seconds per SCons
      invocation, which really helps test suite runs.
    - Remove deprecated SourceSignatures, TargetSignatures
    - Remove deprecated Builder keywords: overrides and scanner
    - Remove deprecated env.Copy
    - Remove deprecated BuildDir plus SConscript keyword
      build_dir
    - A number of documentation improvements.

		validated by SCons (more freedom to users).
  * InstallVersionedLib() doesn't use SHLIBVERSION anymore.
  * Enchanced docs for the library versioning stuff.
  * New tests for versioned libraries.
  * Library versioning is currently implemented for the following

    Compilers. This will be rolled out to other platforms/tools
    in the future.
  - Add check for python >= 3.0.0 and exit gracefully.
    For 1.3 python >= 1.5.2 and < 3.0.0 are supported
  - Fix bug 1944 - Handle non-existent .i file in swig emitter, previously
    it would crash with an IOError exception. Now it will try to make an
    educated guess on the module name based on the filename.
  - Have AddOption() remove variables from the list of
    seen-but-unknown variables (which are reported later).
  - An option name and aliases can now be specified as a tuple.
  - Textfile builder.
  - use "is/is not" in comparisons with None instead of "==" or "!=".
  - Avoid adding -gphobos to a command line multiple times
    when initializing use of the DMD compiler.
  - Fix the -n option when used with VariantDir(duplicate=1)
    and the variant directory doesn't already exist.
  - Fix scanning of Unicode files for both UTF-16 endian flavors.
  - Fix a TypeError on #include of file names with Unicode characters.
  - Fix an exception if a null command-line argument is passed in.
  - Evaluate Requires() prerequisites before a Node's direct children
    (sources and dependencies).
  - Remove redundant __metaclass__ initializations in Environment.py.
  - Correct the documentation of text returned by sconf.Result().
  - Document that filenames with '.' as the first character are
    ignored by Glob() by default (matching UNIX glob semantics).
  - Fix SWIG testing infrastructure to work on Mac OS X.
  - Restructure a test that occasionally hung so that the test would
    detect when it was stuck and fail instead.
  - Substfile builder.
  - When reporting a target that SCons doesn't know how to make,
    specify whether it's a File, Dir, etc.
  - Fix use of $SWIGOUTDIR when generating Python wrappers.
  - Add $SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX and $SWIGVERSION construction variables.
  - Add -recorder flag to Latex commands and updated internals to
    use the output to find files TeX creates. This allows the MiKTeX
    installations to find the created files
  - Notify user of Latex errors that would get buried in the 
    Latex output
  - Remove LATEXSUFFIXES from environments that don't initialize Tex.
  - Add support for the glosaaries package for glossaries and acronyms
  - Fix problem that pdftex, latex, and pdflatex tools by themselves did
    not create the actions for bibtex, makeindex,... by creating them 
    and other environment settings in one routine called by all four 
    tex tools.
  - Fix problem with filenames of sideeffects when the user changes
    the name of the output file from the latex default
  - Add scanning of files included in Latex by means of \lstinputlisting{}
    Patch from Stefan Hepp.
  - Change command line for epstopdf to use --outfile= instead of -o
    since this works on all platforms.
    Patch from Stefan Hepp.
  - Change scanner to properly search for included file from the
    directory of the main file instead of the file it is included from.
    Also update the emitter to add the .aux file associated with
    \include{filename} commands. This makes sure the required directories
    if any are created for variantdir cases.

    SCons exception handling (especially BuildError exceptions).
  - Fix $FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX for the ifort (Intel Fortran) tool.
  - Don't pre-generate an exception message (which will likely be
    ignored anyway) when an EntryProxy re-raises an AttributeError.
  - Handle Java inner classes declared within a method.
  - Fix label placement by the "scons-time.py func" subcommand
    when a profile value was close to (or equal to) 0.0.
  - Fix env.Append() and env.Prepend()'s ability to add a string to
    list-like variables like $CCFLAGS under Python 2.6.
  - Other Python2.6 portability:  don't use "as" (a Python 2.6 keyword).
    Don't use the deprecated Exception.message attribute.
  - Support using the -f option to search for a different top-level
    file name when walking up with the -D, -U or -u options.

    environments (for example, if "CPPPATH" in env: ...).
  - Scan for TeX files in the paths specified in the $TEXINPUTS
    construction variable and the $TEXINPUTS environment variable.
  - Configure the PDF() and PostScript() Builders as single_source so

- updated to 1.1.0

  - Use the specified environment when checking for the GCC compiler
    version.
  - Fix Glob() polluting LIBPATH by returning copy of list
  - Add CheckCC, CheckCXX, CheckSHCC and CheckSHCXX tests to

  - Add scanning Windows resource (.rc) files for implicit dependencies.
  - When scanning for a #include file, don't use a directory that
    has the same name as the file.
  - Suppress error output when checking for the GCC compiler version.
  - Fix VariantDir duplication of #included files in subdirectories.
  - Reduce memory usage when a directory is used as a dependency of
    another Node (such as an Alias) by returning a concatenation
    of the children's signatures + names, not the children's contents,
    as the directory contents.
  - Raise AttributeError, not KeyError, when a Builder can't be found.

    by the get_contents() method) when calling actions with Execute().
  - Avoid object reference cycles from frame objects.
  - Reduce memory usage from Null Executor objects.

    no version number) after "scons-local-{VERSION}".
  - Fix the user's ability to interrupt the TeX build chain.
  - Fix the TeX builder's allowing the user to specify the target name,
    instead of always using its default output name based on the source.
  - Iterate building TeX output files until all warning are gone
    and the auxiliary files stop changing, or until we reach the
    (configurable) maximum number of retries.
  - Add TeX scanner support for:  glossaries, nomenclatures, lists of
    figures, lists of tables, hyperref and beamer.
  - Use the $BIBINPUTS, $BSTINPUTS, $TEXINPUTS and $TEXPICTS construction
    variables as search paths for the relevant types of input file.
  - Fix building TeX with VariantDir(duplicate=0) in effect.
  - Fix the LaTeX scanner to search for graphics on the TEXINPUTS path.
  - Have the PDFLaTeX scanner search for .gif files as well.
  - Fix typos and format bugs in the man page.
  - Add a first draft of a wrapper module for Python's subprocess
    module.
  - Refactor use of the SCons.compat module so other modules don't
    have to import it individually.
  - Add .sx as a suffix for assembly language files that use the
    C preprocessor.
