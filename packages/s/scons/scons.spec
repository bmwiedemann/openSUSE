%description
SCons is a make replacement that provides a range of enhanced features,
such as automated dependency generation and built-in compilation cache
support. SCons rule sets are Python scripts, which means that SCons
provides itself as well as the features. SCons allows you to use the
full power of Python to control compilation.
