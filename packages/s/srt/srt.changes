- Update to version 1.4.2
  New Features and Enhancements
    * Added support for C++11. Reworked timing and
      synchronization objects. Three sources of timing are now
      available (selected via a build option):
      + POSIX gettimeofday() - default build mode (affected by
        discontinuous jumps in the system time);
      + POSIX CLOCK_MONOTONIC. CMake build option:
        -DENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK=ON. See --enable-monotonic-clock
        in BuildOptions.md;
      + C++11 std::chrono::steady_clock, std::thread,
        std::mutex, etc. CMake build option:
        -DENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC=ON. See --enable-stdcxx-sync in
        BuildOptions.md.
    * Added SRT Source Time API support. It allows setting a
      source timestamp on a packet that corresponds to a packet
      creation/reception time. See the Time Access section of
      the API docs.
    * Added an improved retransmission algorithm which reduces
      the retransmission overhead on a link. Set option
      SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO=1.
    * Added SRTO_BINDTODEVICE option to bind a socket to a
      specified NIC. SRTO_BINDTODEVICE option reflects the
      system option SO_BINDTODEVICE for an SRT socket.
    * Customizable rejection reason code. SRT library now lets
      the application provide a code with rejection reason (in a
      listener callback) if connection request has been rejected
      by the application. See Rejection Codes in the Access
      Control guide.
    * Added new rejection reason: on timeout. See
      SRT_REJ_TIMEOUT in API-functions.md.
    * Extended SRT statistics with pktSentUniqueTotal,
      pktRecvUniqueTotal. Statistics documentation now has a
      summary table for better navigation.
    * Added srt_getversion() API function.
    * Moved socket options documentation to a separate file
      APISocketOptions.md. It now has a summary table for better
      navigation.
    * Socket options SRTO_INPUTBW and SRTO_OHEADBW are now
      readable.
    * The logging functionality has been improved by means of
      defining new and more fine-grained Functional Areas (FA)
      to which log messages are assigned. This is done to prevent
      too many debug log messages from the library influencing
      performance with the debug logging turned on.
    Fixed Issues
    * Fixed bug: finding the listener's muxer only by port
      number was wrong.
    * Fixed wrong reject reason on async connect.
    * Fixed CSndLossList::insert with negative offset.
    * Fixed default binding for IPv6-target rendezvous.
    * Fixed HS TSBPD flags check.
    * Improved CRcvLossList protection from concurrent access.
    * Fixed error reporting on connect/accept.
    * Correctly handle IPv4 connections on IPv6 listener.
    * Fixed Moving Average for receiver and sender buffers.
    * Protecting RCV buffer access.
    * Fixed local storage depleted issue #486.
    * Fixed restrictions on pre-bind only options.
    * Avoid reporting packets rebuilt by FEC as lost.
    * Improved inserting a serial element into sender's loss
      list.
    * Fixed handling of stale loss report.
    * Fixed closing the crypto control.
    * Added CSync class as a high-level CV wrapper.
    * Renamed legacy UDT_EPOLL_* symbols.
    * Eliminated ref_t. Some more convention fixes.
    * Crypto: Reset the passphrase in memory on close for
      security reasons.
    Deprecated or Renamed
    * Removed deprecated socket options: SRTO_TWOWAYDATA,
      SRTO_TSBPDMAXLAG, SRTO_CC, SRTO_MAXMSG, SRTO_MSGTTL,
      SRTO_SNDPBKEYLEN, SRTO_RCVPBKEYLEN.
    * Removed deprecated option names: SRTO_SMOOTHER (use
      SRTO_CONGESTION), SRTO_STRICTENC (use
      SRTO_ENFORCEDENCRYPTION).
    version 1.4.1:
    Improvements
    * Improved periodic NAK report timing
    * Use monotonic clock in CTimer::sleepto()
    * Initial reorder tolerance set to maximum value
      (SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL)
    * Added pktReorderTolerance to stats
    * Use busy wait only to refine below 1 ms
    * Added SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL to srt_getopt()
    * Update SND loss list on lite ACK
    Fixes
    * Fixed catching exception from
      CUDTUnited::connect_complete()
    * Fixed missing vertical FEC/CTL packet
    * Fixed bandwidth measurement on non-monotonic or
      retransmitted packets
    * Fixed srt_getopt(...): optlen is not set in some cases.
    * Fixed EPoll update_usock
    * Fixed checkTimers interval (100ms -> 10 ms)
    * Fixed SRT Stats backward compatibility (CBytePerfMon
      fields order)
    * Fixed FEC crash when a large number of dropped packets
      occur
    * Fixed FEC crash (access item out of range)
    * Fixed FileCC crash. Prevented 0 pktsInFlight to be used in
      the calculation for loss percentage
    version 1.4.0:
    New Features and Enhancements
    * Updates to epoll API. Added edge-triggered epoll wait.
    * srt-live-transmit default chunk size set to 1456
    * Added forward error correction (FEC) packet filter
    * Added Packet filter API
    * File congestion control improvements
    Fixed Issues
    * Free addrinfo if bind fails (potential memory leak)
    * Fixed SRTO_LOSSMAXTTL option on accepted socket
    * Fixed blocking srt_connect call (state update)
    * Fixed potential sender's sockets list overflow
    * Use MONOTONIC clock in Garbage Collector thread
- Drop CVE-2019-15784.patch (fixed upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 13 15:23:23 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop pkgconfig(zlib) BuildRequires: this is only needed on
  win32/mingw (and even there it rather seems like working around a
  bug in some other package, as there is no explicit call to zlib
  functions).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 30 12:47:57 UTC 2019 - Alexandros Toptsoglou <atoptsoglou@suse.com>

- Backported commit 47e5890 and 64875fa to fix CVE-2019-15784
  (boo#1148844) and avoid a potential array overflow.
  * Added CVE-2019-15784.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 13 12:54:11 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Fix install prefix in cmake so the pkgconfig file has correct
  information on where to find srt's libraries and include files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 29 09:10:45 UTC 2018 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add pkgconfig(zlib) BuildRequires: until openssl 1.1.1, zlib was
  pulled in into our buildroot, avoiding srt having to care for it
  explicitly. Since this is changed now, we have to worry for our
  dependency on our own. The dep comes from:
  CMakeLists.txt:set (SSL_REQUIRED_MODULES "openssl libcrypto zlib")
