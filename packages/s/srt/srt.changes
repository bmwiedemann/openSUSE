Sun Mar 27 19:40:15 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.4:
  * Monotonic/steady clock is enabled by default.
  * Changed the default value of SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO socket option to 1. This
    activates the efficient retransmission algorithm on the sender side which
    optimizes the bandwidth usage by producing fewer retransmissions per lost
    packet. The algorithm is available since v1.4.2. Intensive retransmission
    algorithm (the former default) can be activated by setting
    SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO=0.
  * Improved random integer retrieval, which is mainly used for initial socket
    ID and Initial Sequence Number (ISN) generation.
  * Improved clock drift compensation algorithm. RTT samples are now taken into
    account when estimating clock drift.
  * Improved round-trip time (RTT) estimation.
    On the receiver side, smoothed RTT (SRTT) is set to the first RTT
    measurement obtained from the first ACK/ACKACK pair. When a subsequent RTT
    measurement is made, an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is used to
    update smoothed RTT. Before the very first RTT sample is available, SRTT is
    initialized as 100 ms or taken from the cache if one exists.
  * On the sender side, in the case of unidirectional transmission, the values of
    smoothed RTT and RTT variance are now extracted from ACK packets. In the case
    of bidirectional transmission, an EWMA is still applied to be consistent with
    the previous behavior.
  * Improved 'No room to store incoming packet' warning with additional hints
    to identify a possible reason.
  * Added support for atomic types.
  * Improved the logic of switching between main and backup links, extended the
    list of member link states as well as defined events resulting in state
    transition for Main/Backup mode of Connection Bonding.
  * Documented Main/Backup mode of Connection Bonding. See here.
  * Fixed group read-readiness update on the receiver side.
  * Added missing lock when checking for read-readiness of a group member and
    fixed the resulting crash.
  * Fixed base time and drift synchronization in a group, which caused
    insufficient packet loss recovery and end-to-end latency maintenance by a
    group receiver.
  * Fixed validation of the packet sequence number when reading from a group
    member, which was causing an incorrect decision to break a member
    connection.
  * Fixed crash on dereferencing null CryptoControl instance in handshake reply.
  * Placed some of the SRT classes under the 'srt' namespace.
  * Fixed possible incorrect outcome of cookie contest function (rendezvous
    connection mode) under certain compiler optimizations.
  * Fixed uninitialized destination socket ID in Shutdown control message.
  * Set CLOEXEC for epoll on Linux.
  * Added missing receiver buffer lock into CUDT::receiveBuffer(..) and
    CUDT::recvfile(..) functions.
  * Make sure TTL will not drop packets over the last block.
  * Fixed the value of the Last Packet Sequence Number field in Drop Request
    control message on TTL packet drop.
  * Fixed the content of the Drop Request control message. If a loss of packets
    already missing in the sender buffer was reported, the very first packet
    present in the sender buffer was incorrectly included in the range of
    packets to be dropped.
  * Fixed version rejection for handshake v4 caller (SRT prior to v1.3.0).
  * Fixed the crash when referencing a resource already freed in CRendezvousQueue class.
  * Fixed detection of reusable bindings and binding conflicts.
  * Updated SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO socket option description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 11 23:55:15 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 1.4.3
  * API/ABI/Integration Changes
    * fixed/changed cast to bool instead of int in srt_getsockopt and 
      srt_getsockflag API functions
    * Fixed ABI compatibility around SRTO_BINDTODEVICE value
      depending on ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BONDING.
    * Made SRT versioned SO named with major and minor
  * New Features and Enhancements
    * New API function srt_clock_type() to retrieve SRT internal
      clock type.
    * New SRTO_MININPUTBW socket option to control the minimum
      allowed value of the input bitrate estimate.
    * Run the accept hook (listener callback) before opening an
      accepted socket providing an opportunity to set some ‘PRE’
      options (like SRTO_RCVBUF).
  * Fixed wrong check of common FEC configuration.
  * Added handshake data check to prevent rogue handshakes.
  * Fixed crash and hang up related to CSndLossList.
  * Fixed miscalculations on extreme loss conditions in FEC.
  * Fixed Data race when TLPKTDROP while checking loss for ACK
    candidate.
  * Fixed handshake IP parsing in IPv4-IPv6 connections.
  * Fixed race starting and joining TSBPD thread.
  * SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO becomes readable.

- Add patch to fix build with GCC 11 (boo#1181883)
  * 0001-Fix-build-with-GCC-11.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  7 09:01:37 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 1.4.2
  New Features and Enhancements
    * Added support for C++11. Reworked timing and
      synchronization objects. Three sources of timing are now
      available (selected via a build option):
      + POSIX gettimeofday() - default build mode (affected by
        discontinuous jumps in the system time);
      + POSIX CLOCK_MONOTONIC. CMake build option:
        -DENABLE_MONOTONIC_CLOCK=ON. See --enable-monotonic-clock
        in BuildOptions.md;
      + C++11 std::chrono::steady_clock, std::thread,
        std::mutex, etc. CMake build option:
        -DENABLE_STDCXX_SYNC=ON. See --enable-stdcxx-sync in
        BuildOptions.md.
    * Added SRT Source Time API support. It allows setting a
      source timestamp on a packet that corresponds to a packet
      creation/reception time. See the Time Access section of
      the API docs.
    * Added an improved retransmission algorithm which reduces
      the retransmission overhead on a link. Set option
      SRTO_RETRANSMITALGO=1.
    * Added SRTO_BINDTODEVICE option to bind a socket to a
      specified NIC. SRTO_BINDTODEVICE option reflects the
      system option SO_BINDTODEVICE for an SRT socket.
    * Customizable rejection reason code. SRT library now lets
      the application provide a code with rejection reason (in a
      listener callback) if connection request has been rejected
      by the application. See Rejection Codes in the Access
      Control guide.
    * Added new rejection reason: on timeout. See
      SRT_REJ_TIMEOUT in API-functions.md.
    * Extended SRT statistics with pktSentUniqueTotal,
      pktRecvUniqueTotal. Statistics documentation now has a
      summary table for better navigation.
    * Added srt_getversion() API function.
    * Moved socket options documentation to a separate file
      APISocketOptions.md. It now has a summary table for better
      navigation.
    * Socket options SRTO_INPUTBW and SRTO_OHEADBW are now
      readable.
    * The logging functionality has been improved by means of
      defining new and more fine-grained Functional Areas (FA)
      to which log messages are assigned. This is done to prevent
      too many debug log messages from the library influencing
      performance with the debug logging turned on.
    Fixed Issues
    * Fixed bug: finding the listener's muxer only by port
      number was wrong.
    * Fixed wrong reject reason on async connect.
    * Fixed CSndLossList::insert with negative offset.
    * Fixed default binding for IPv6-target rendezvous.

    * Correctly handle IPv4 connections on IPv6 listener.
    * Fixed Moving Average for receiver and sender buffers.
    * Protecting RCV buffer access.
    * Fixed local storage depleted issue #486.
    * Fixed restrictions on pre-bind only options.
    * Avoid reporting packets rebuilt by FEC as lost.
    * Improved inserting a serial element into sender's loss
      list.
    * Fixed handling of stale loss report.
    * Fixed closing the crypto control.
    * Added CSync class as a high-level CV wrapper.
    * Renamed legacy UDT_EPOLL_* symbols.
    * Eliminated ref_t. Some more convention fixes.
    * Crypto: Reset the passphrase in memory on close for
      security reasons.
    Deprecated or Renamed
    * Removed deprecated socket options: SRTO_TWOWAYDATA,
      SRTO_TSBPDMAXLAG, SRTO_CC, SRTO_MAXMSG, SRTO_MSGTTL,
      SRTO_SNDPBKEYLEN, SRTO_RCVPBKEYLEN.
    * Removed deprecated option names: SRTO_SMOOTHER (use
      SRTO_CONGESTION), SRTO_STRICTENC (use
      SRTO_ENFORCEDENCRYPTION).
    version 1.4.1:
    Improvements
    * Improved periodic NAK report timing
    * Use monotonic clock in CTimer::sleepto()

- Fix install prefix in cmake so the pkgconfig file has correct
  information on where to find srt's libraries and include files.

- Add pkgconfig(zlib) BuildRequires: until openssl 1.1.1, zlib was
  pulled in into our buildroot, avoiding srt having to care for it
  explicitly. Since this is changed now, we have to worry for our
  dependency on our own. The dep comes from:
  CMakeLists.txt:set (SSL_REQUIRED_MODULES "openssl libcrypto zlib")
