- Packaging improvements:
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Normalize go build invocation extracted from upstream Makefile
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Drop upstream go build arguments used in upstream Makefile.
    -ldflags="-extldflags -static"
    Absent a clear need, use go build defaults.
  * Remove ldflags -s (Omit symbol table and debug info) and -w
    (Omit DWARF symbol table). This information is used to produce
    separate debuginfo packages and binaries are stripped for
    reduced size by GNU strip during RPM build.
  * Drop use of strip utility. Binaries are stripped automatically.
  * Drop BuildRequires: binutils no longer needed
