  <title>SGML-Tools - a Text-Formatting Package</title>
  <description>SGML-Tools is a text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language), which allows you to produce LaTeX, HTML,
GNU info, LyX, RTF, and plain ASCII documents (via groff) from a single
source.

This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
an example of which is the Linux HOWTO documents. It should be useful
for all kinds of printed and online documentation.

This package is the successor to the Linuxdoc package.

SGML-Tools cannot process arbitrary SGML documents. In such a case, try
jade_dsl and write your own DSSSL scripts (take the docbk30 package as
an example).</description>
