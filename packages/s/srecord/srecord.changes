- Update to version 1.64
  * Fixed some warnings in test 38
  * Fixed bugs regarding the formatting of some of the examples
    where lines were wrapping the wrong way.
  * Cleaned up a few recent compiler and doxygen warnings.
  * Added prefix and postfix strings to the C Array format which
    are applied at each end of the data array declaration. This
    allows the user to add various compiler directives such as
    location flags or non-standard load address specifiers.
  * when converting from AOMF Fixed Sourceforge bug 11 raised by
    patryks. In the analysis, it was discovered that a start address
    (of zero) was being generated when converting from AOMF. AOMF
    does not support the concept of an execution start address.
  * Fixed the length field description in extended tektronix
    documentation. The implementation was already correct.
  * Added a regression test for calculated address for CRC
