  <title>Makes waiting for smart card events easy</title>
  <description>SCMon monitors smart cards, configured in a system-wide nss database,
and broadcasts their insertion/removal over D-Bus. It also supports a
few simple queries.

It is intended to make it easy for applications such as screensavers
and login managers to support smart card events.</description>
