  <title>System InformaTion at Runtime</title>
  <description>Sitar prepares system information using perl and binary tools, and by
reading the /proc file system. Output is in HTML, LaTeX and (docbook)
XML, and can be converted to PS and PDF.

This program must be run as &quot;root&quot;.

sitar.pl includes scsiinfo by Eric Youngdale, Michael Weller
&lt;eowmob@exp-math.uni-essen.de&gt; and ide_info by David A. Hinds
&lt;dhinds@hyper.stanford.edu&gt;.

The accompanying tool &quot;cfg2scm&quot; is supplied for checking configuration
changes into SCMs (like SVN, CVS, ...) or creating a tar-file with all
relevant files.

Comment: Sitar is an ancient Indian instrument as well.</description>
