%description
Spew is used to measure I/O performance of character devices, block devices,
and regular files. It can also be used to generate high I/O loads to stress
systems while verifying data integrity.

Spew is easy to use and is flexible. No configuration files or complicated
client/server configurations are needed. Spew also generates its own data
patterns that are designed to make it easy to find and debug data integrity
problems.
