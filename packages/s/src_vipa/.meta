  <title>Virtual Source IP address support for HA solutions</title>
  <description>This package provides very flexible means of source IP address
selection to arbitrary applications. This is particularly useful for
high availability setups, where the dummy device holds a &quot;VIPA&quot;
(virtual IP address). Please read the
/usr/share/doc/packages/src_vipa/README and the manpage of src_vipa for
further information.</description>
