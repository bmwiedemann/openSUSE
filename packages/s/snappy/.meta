  <title>A fast compressor/decompressor library</title>
  <description>Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum compression, 
or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high 
speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, 
Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed 
files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor 
in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 
500 MB/sec or more.

Do NOT submit it to factory without asking or the package will be yours to maintain.
