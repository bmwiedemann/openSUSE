%description
Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it
aims for high speeds and reasonable compression.

%description -n %{libname}
Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it
aims for high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to
the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most
inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20%% to 100%%
bigger. On a single core of a 1st-generation Core i7 processor in 64-bit
mode, Snappy compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about
500 MB/sec or more.

This package holds the shared library of snappy.
