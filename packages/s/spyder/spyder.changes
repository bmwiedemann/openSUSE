- Update to version 3.3.2:
 - New features
  - Main Window
   * Add new German and Hungarian translations.
  - Preferences
   * Give users the ability to select the OpenGL implementation
     used by Qt. This option can be changed in
     `General > Advanced Settings > Rendering engine`.
  - Find in files
   * Simplify the way to exclude files from search.
   * Fix error that prevented to stop a search when it was in
     progress.
   * Save its options when Spyder is closed.
  - Under the hood
   * Don't remove Spyder's temporary directory when Spyder is
     closed. This avoids conflicts when multiple Spyder
     instances are running.

  * Variable explorer/Dictionary editor: added option to plot histogram from a 1-D array
  * Console:
    * standard Python interpreter is now a real Python interactive session: the older implementation was running a startup script and tried to emulate a standard Python interactive session (changing attributes like __name__, running the PYTHONSTARTUP script, etc.). But this implementation was not close enough to the standard Python interactive session, i.e. when you execute `python` outside Spyder, without any argument. A recent bug report confirmed this: the PYTHONSTARTUP script was executed but not exactly the same way as it is outside Spyder: for example, doing `from __future__ import division` in the startup script had no effect whereas it did outside Spyder.
    * when running a standard Python interpreter, instead of running the startup script (spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/startup.py), the shell widget (ExternalPythonShell) simply runs the python executable with -u -i options, that's all. So now, the PYTHONSTARTUP script is executed as expected.
    * Scientific startup script (default PYTHONSTARTUP in Spyder): added floating point division (from __future__ import division)
    * PySide support:
      * Added new "Qt (PyQt/PySide)" settings group in "External modules" tab
      * It is now possible to select the Qt-Python bindings library: default (i.e. depends on the QT_API environment variable), PyQt or PySide
      * The PyQt input hook has been adapted for PySide, so it is now possible to do interactive (non-blocking) plotting with PySide
    * New options for standard Python interpreters (no effect on IPython):
      * "Merge process standard output/error channels": merging the output channels of the process means that the standard error won't be written in red anymore, but this has the effect of speeding up display
      * "Colorize standard error channel using ANSI escape codes": this method is the only way to have colorized standard error channel when the output channels have been merged
  * Internal console (Issue 868): output is now immediately available
  * "Maximize current plugin" action: now automatically shows the "Outline" plugin when maximizing the "Editor" plugin
  * Editor/Outline comment separators: allow space betwee hash and dash, e.g "# --- Outline Separator"
- Update to Version 2.1.4
  * Bug fixes
  * Console:
    * option "Open an IPython interperter at startup" is now *explicitely* disabled for IPython v0.11+ (these versions of IPython are not fully supported through Spyder's console plugin)
- Update to Version 2.1.3
  * Bug fixes
  * Variable explorer performance were improved, especially when dealing with very long sequences -- See this discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib/browse_thread/thread/3a7ef892695e417a
  * Variable explorer / dictionary editor: added support for unknown objects -- this allows browsing any object attributes -- This is still experimental.
- Update to Version 2.1.2
  * Bug fixes
  * File/Project explorer:
    * Added "Delete" keyboard shortcut to remove selected file(s)/folder(s)
    * SCM integration: added support for !TortoiseHg v2 (only v1 was supported)
  * Console/Matplotlib options: the backend may now be set separately from the Matplotlib patch
  * Console:
    * The Matplotlib patch is only applied for Matplotlib <=v1.0
    * !PyQt API version issues (error like "!ValueError: API 'QString' has already been set to version 1"): the "ignore setapi errors" option is disabled by default, to avoid masking these errors and associated tracebacks
- Update to Version 2.1.1
  * Bug fixes
- Update to Version 2.1
  * Bug fixes
  * New *Profiler* plugin (thanks to Santiago Jaramillo)
  * New experimental *IPython* plugin embedding IPython's Qt console: see [http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/08/preview-of-new-ipython-plugin-for.html here]
  * General:
    * Main window:
      * added "Custom window layouts" management (see menu "View")/handling 3 custom layouts: default shortcuts Shift+Alt+FX to switch to/from layout #X and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+FX to set layout #X
      * "General" preferences page: added option to set the Qt windows style, depending on platform (Plastique, Cleanlooks, CDE, Windows...)
      * Menu "?": added menu entry to report Spyder issues, filling automatically informations on your configuration
      * Reorganized "Run"/"Source" menu, added "Interpreters" menu
      * Fixed application name for Gnome 3/Fedora 15
    * Command line options: added option "--defaults" to reset settings (stored in .spyder.ini) to defaults (a lot of settings are preserved: shortcuts, window layouts, ...) -- this is less brutal than "--reset" which reset all settings by removing all configuration files related to Spyder
  * *Outline* (function/class browser) is now a plugin in itself, embedded in its own dockwidget: Spyder's window layout is even more customizable than before
  * *Code completion*
    * (Editor/Console): entries starting with an underscore character are now placed to the end of the suggested list
    * (Editor/Console): Import statements are now completed correctly
  * *Console*:
    * Major code cleaning: running Python applications in Spyder has never been cleaner and is very close to a simple Python interpreter
    * Added built-in function `open_in_spyder` to open a file in Spyder's source code editor from the console
    * Standard Python interpreter:
      * now refresh the variable explorer at each new prompt (even if auto-refresh is disabled -- actually, this is the typical use case)
      * added support for basic special commands (%pwd, %ls, %clear) and system commands (starting with '!', e.g. !dir or !ls)
      * added [http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-enhanced-scientific-python.html "scientific" startup script] with support for numpy, scipy and matplotlib
    * Preferences (External modules tab):
      * added an option to set !PyQt API to v1 or v2 -- this avoids issues with Enthought Tool Suite or any other library/program using !PyQt API v2 which is *not* the default API for Python 2
      * changed matplotlib patch to fix compatiblity issue with !PyQt API v2
    * Preferences (Advanced Settings tab): added option "Python executable" to customize path to Python interpreter executable binary
  * *Variable explorer*:
    * New HDF5 plugin ([http://code.google.com/u/DavidAnthonyPowell/ DavidAnthonyPowell]): import/export HDF5 files to/from the variable explorer
    * Dictionary editor/Variable explorer:
      * Added support for more NumPy data types
      * Added action "Resize rows to contents" (partially implements feature requested with Issue 807)
  * *Editor*:
    * find/replace:
      * added support for *multiline* regular expression search pattern
      * added support for *multiline* regular expression text replacement
      * added button "Highlight matches" to highlight all found results
    * syntax highlighting: added support for OpenCL, gettext files, patch/diff files, CSS and HTML files
    * support for "2 spaces" and "tabs" indentation characters
    * new code analysis feature: added support for the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8 pep8] style guide checker
    * "Comment" and "Uncomment" actions were replaced by a single "Comment/Uncommment" toggle action
    * (Fixes  Issue 811 ) "Run configuration": added "Run in an external system terminal" option
  * *File explorer* and *Project explorer*:
    * great performance improvement (using a multithreaded file system model)
    * Added minimalist SCM support (Mercurial and git are currently supported)
  * *File explorer*: added an option to "Show current directory only"
  * *Project explorer*: this plugin was entirely rewritten to improve performances and usability
  * *Pylint plugin*:
    * added option to save file before analyzing it
  * *Spyder's console embedded in your application (spyderlib.widgets.internalshell):
    * in traceback, a clickable link now opens the associated file in Spyder (if application was launched from Spyder with monitor enabled)
    * Application sample embedding Spyder's internal shell: upgraded to guidata v1.4+ (simplified build script a lot!)
- Update to Version 2.0.12
  * Bug fixes
  * (Fixes Issue 655) Editor/pyflakes-powered code analysis: warnings are now ignored for lines containing "pyflakes:ignore"
  * Internal console (Spyder debugging only): turned off the multithreaded mode
- Update to Version 2.0.11
  * Bug fixes
  * File explorer widget/plugin: improved performances (widget is now populated in a separate thread)
  * Spyder crash dialog: warning the user about the '--reset' option (this will remove all configuration files)
