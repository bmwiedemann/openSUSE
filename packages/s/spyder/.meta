  <description>Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment, is an
IDE for researchers, engineers and data analysts.
It features a combination of the editing, analysis, debugging
and profiling functionality of a development tool with the
data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and
visualization capabilities of an analysis package. Additionally,
Spyder offers built-in integration with scientific
libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole,
Matplotlib, SymPy, and more, and can be extended further with
full plugin support.
