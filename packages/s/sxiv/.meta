  <title>sxiv</title>
  <description>The primary goal of sxiv is to create an image viewer,
which only has the most basic features required for fast image viewing
(the ones I want). It has vi key bindings and works nicely with
tiling window managers. Its code base should be kept small and
clean to make it easy for you to dig into it and customize it for your needs.
