  <title>Simple Scanning Utility</title>
  <description>Simple Scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users connect
their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an appropriate
format.

Simple Scan is basically a frontend for SANE - which is the same backend
as XSANE uses. This means that all existing scanners will work and the
interface is well tested.</description>
