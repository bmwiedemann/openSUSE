- Update to version 1.0.0:
  * Fixed newline-only srv3 events creating empty visual lines (they are now
    ignored).
  * Fixed incorrect advance being used during layout of glyphs from
    non-scalable fonts. Mostly affects emoji which previously took up excessive
    horizontal space.
  * Implemented srv3 visual line padding.
  * Switched xtask (build|install) to use cargo rustc and made it stop building
    disabled library types.
  * Made xtask (build|install) query rustc for required static libraries
    instead of hard-coding them.
  * Fixed ruby annotation layout on non-72 DPIs.
  * Improved text decorations to better conform to the css-2 specification.
    WebVTT underlines will now be painted after shadows and before the text
    itself.
  * Fixed incorrect fractional positioning of blurred shadows. This fixes
    blurred shadows slightly jumping around in karaoke subtitles.
  * Fixed software rasterizer not pre-multiplying color values while drawing
    geometric primitives. Fixes sometimes broken partially transparent
    backgrounds.
  * Fixed panic in bidi reordering of some multi-paragraph text runs.
  * Implemented srv3 underline support.
  * Made WebVTT parser correctly ignore STYLE and REGION blocks following the
    first cue.
  * Ruby annotations are now shaped with the ruby OpenType feature enabled.
  * Shaping is now done with character cluster level. This means that
    intra-grapheme styling changes are now sometimes possible.
  * Failing to initialize a font provider will now result in an error instead
    of a panic.
  * Failing to open a font in the DirectWrite font provider will no longer lead
    to it failing to initialize (a warning is logged instead).
  * Fixed rendering of COLRv0 glyphs.
  * Fixed DPI scaling of tofu font.
  * Fixed many line-breaking and padding edge cases.
  * Made background box rounding significantly saner.
  * Increased target glyph cache memory footprint to 8MiB as 2MiB was very
    easily reached on HiDPI.
  * Text shadow y-positions are now rounded (like text baselines).
  * SRV3 is now laid out with inline-sizing: stretch set on most boxes.

- Update to version 0.2.2:
  * Fixed out-of-bounds write in software rasterizer

- Update to version 0.2.1:
  * Significantly improved software rasterization performance.
  * Fixed pixel scale handling in font matching. After the introduction of the
    new inline layout engine fonts were being unintentionally scaled twice on
    DPIs other than 72.
  * Added Android NDK font provider for better font matching on Android.
