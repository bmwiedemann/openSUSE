    <comment>- Update to version 1.0.0:
* Fixed newline-only srv3 events creating empty visual lines (they are now
ignored).
* Fixed incorrect advance being used during layout of glyphs from
non-scalable fonts. Mostly affects emoji which previously took up excessive
horizontal space.
* Implemented srv3 visual line padding.
* Switched xtask (build|install) to use cargo rustc and made it stop building
disabled library types.
* Made xtask (build|install) query rustc for required static libraries
instead of hard-coding them.
* Fixed ruby annotation layout on non-72 DPIs.
* Improved text decorations to better conform to the css-2 specification.
WebVTT underlines will now be painted after shadows and before the text
itself.
* Fixed incorrect fractional positioning of blurred shadows. This fixes
blurred shadows slightly jumping around in karaoke subtitles.
* Fixed software rasterizer not pre-multiplying color values while drawing
geometric primitives. Fixes sometimes broken partially transparent
backgrounds.
* Fixed panic in bidi reordering of some multi-paragraph text runs.
* Implemented srv3 underline support.
* Made WebVTT parser correctly ignore STYLE and REGION blocks following the
first cue.
* Ruby annotations are now shaped with the ruby OpenType feature enabled.
* Shaping is now done with character cluster level. This means that
intra-grapheme styling changes are now sometimes possible.
* Failing to initialize a font provider will now result in an error instead
of a panic.
* Failing to open a font in the DirectWrite font provider will no longer lead
to it failing to initialize (a warning is logged instead).
* Fixed rendering of COLRv0 glyphs.
* Fixed DPI scaling of tofu font.
* Fixed many line-breaking and padding edge cases.
* Made background box rounding significantly saner.
* Increased target glyph cache memory footprint to 8MiB as 2MiB was very
easily reached on HiDPI.
* Text shadow y-positions are now rounded (like text baselines).
* SRV3 is now laid out with inline-sizing: stretch set on most boxes.
- Update to version 0.2.2:
* Fixed out-of-bounds write in software rasterizer
- Update to version 0.2.1:
* Significantly improved software rasterization performance.
* Fixed pixel scale handling in font matching. After the introduction of the
new inline layout engine fonts were being unintentionally scaled twice on
DPIs other than 72.
* Added Android NDK font provider for better font matching on Android. </comment>
