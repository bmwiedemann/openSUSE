  <title>Synthesis ToolKit in C++</title>
  <description>The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++
programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid development
of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis on
cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of use, and
educational example code. The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable
(it's mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely
user-extensible (all source included, no unusual libraries, and no
hidden drivers). We like to think that this increases the chances that
our programs will still work in another 5-10 years. In fact, the
ToolKit has been working continuously for about 10 years now. STK
currently runs with realtime support (audio and MIDI) on Linux,
Macintosh OS X, and Windows computer platforms. Generic, non-realtime
support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms and
should work with any standard C++ compiler.
