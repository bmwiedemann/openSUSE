<package name="spamassassin" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>Extensible email filter which is used to identify spam</title>
  <description>spamassassin adds a header line that shows if the mail has been
determined spam or not. This way, you can decide what to do with the
mail within the scope of your own filtering rules in your MUA (Mail
User Agent, your mail program) or your LDA (Local Delivery Agent).

See the files in the documentation directory
/usr/share/doc/packages/spamassassin/ for more information on how to
use the filter.</description>
