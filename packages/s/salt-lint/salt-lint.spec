Salt-lint
=========

``salt-lint`` checks Salt state files (SLS) for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.

The project is heavily based on `ansible-lint`_, which was created by `Will Thames`_ and is now maintained as part of the `Ansible`_ by `Red Hat`_ project.

Installing
==========

Using Pip
---------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install salt-lint

From Source
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/roaldnefs/salt-lint.git

Usage
=====

Command Line Options
--------------------

The following is the output from ``salt-lint --help``, providing an overview of the basic command line options:

.. code-block:: bash

   Usage: salt-lint [options] init.sls [state ...]

   Options:
     --version             show program's version number and exit
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -L                    list all the rules
     -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
                           more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
                           rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules, unless -R
                           is also used.
     -R                    Use default rules in /tmp/saltlint/lib/saltlint/rules
                           in addition to any extra rules directories specified
                           with -r. There is no need to specify this if no -r
                           flags are used.
     -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
     -T                    list all the tags
     -v                    Increase verbosity level
     -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
                           values
     --nocolor             disable colored output
     --force-color         Try force colored output (relying on salt's code)
     --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS
                           path to directories or files to skip. This option is
                           repeatable.
     -c C                  Specify configuration file to use.  Defaults to
                           ".salt-lint"

Linting Salt state files
------------------------

It's important to note that ``salt-lint`` accepts a list of Salt state files or a list of directories.

GitHub Action
-------------

Salt-lint is available on the GitHub `marketplace`_ as a GitHub Action. The `salt-lint-action`_ allows you to run ``salt-lint`` with no additional options.

To use the action simply add the following lines to your ``.github/workflows/main.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Salt Lint Action
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - name: Run salt-lint
          uses: roaldnefs/salt-lint-action@master
          env:
            ACTION_STATE_NAME: init.sls

Configuring
===========

Configuration File
------------------

Salt-lint supports local configuration via a ``.salt-lint`` configuration file. Salt-lint checks the working directory for the presence of this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file location can also be overridden via the ``-c path/to/file`` CLI flag.

If a value is provided on both the command line and via a configuration file, the values will be merged (if a list like **exclude_paths**), or the **True** value will be preferred, in the case of something like **quiet**.

The following values are supported, and function identically to their CLI counterparts:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    exclude_paths:
      - exclude_this_file
      - exclude_this_directory/
      - exclude/this/sub-directory/
    skip_list:
      - 207
      - 208
    tags:
      - formatting
    verbosity: 1

Pre-commit Setup
----------------

To use salt-lint with `pre-commit`_,  just add the following to your local repo's ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file. Prior to version 0.12.0 of `pre-commit`_ the file was ``hooks.yaml`` (now ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``).

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

    # For use with pre-commit.
    # See usage instructions at http://pre-commit.com

    -   id: salt-lint
        name: Salt-lint
        description: This hook runs salt-lint.
        entry: salt-lint
        language: python
        files: \.(sls)$

Rules
=====

False Positives: Skipping Rules
-------------------------------

Some rules are bit of a rule of thumb. To skip a specific rule for a specific task, inside your state add ``# noqa [rule_id]`` at the end of the line. You can skip multiple rules via a space-separated list. Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    /tmp/testfile:
      file.managed:
        - source: salt://{{unspaced_var}}/example  # noqa: 206

Authors
=======

salt-lint is heavily based on `ansible-lint`_ with the modified work by `Roald Nefs`_. `ansible-lint`_ was created by `Will Thames`_ and is now maintained as part of the `Ansible`_ by `Red Hat`_ project.
