%description
SSHFS is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to
set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.	On the client
side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with
openssh (ssh).
