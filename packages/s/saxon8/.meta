  <title>Java Basic XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0, and XQuery 1.0 implementation</title>
  <description>Release 8.6 represents an important milestone in Saxonica's progressive
implementation of the XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0, and XQuery 1.0
specifications. Saxon 8.6 is aligned with the W3C Candidate
Recommendation published on 3 November 2005. It is a complete and
conformant implementation, providing all the mandatory features of
those specifications and nearly all the optional features. Saxon is
available in two versions. Saxon-B is a non-schema-aware processor, and
is available as an open-source product, free of charge, from
SourceForge. It is designed to conform to the basic conformance level
of XSLT 2.0, and the equivalent level of functionality in XQuery 1.0.
Saxon-SA is the schema-aware version of the package, and is available
as a commercially supported product from Saxonica Limited.

This package provides the Basic XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 processor.
Includes the command line interfaces and the JAVA APIs; also includes a
standalone XPath API that doesn't depend on JAXP 1.3.</description>
