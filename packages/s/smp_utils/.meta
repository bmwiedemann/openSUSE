  <title>Utilities for the SAS Management Protocol (SMP)</title>
  <description>The smp_utils package contains utilities for the Serial Attached SCSI
(SAS) Management Protocol (SMP).  Most utilities correspond to a single
SMP function, sending out a request, checking for errors and if all is
well processing the response. The response is either decoded, printed
out in ASCII hexadecimal or sent as binary to stdout.</description>
