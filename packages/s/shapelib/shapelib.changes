- Update to version 1.6.0

Changes since v1.5.0:

    * shapefil.h: add SHAPELIB_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO, SHAPELIB_VERSION_NUMBER, and SHAPELIB_AT_LEAST macros
    * Compiler warning fixes and various code cleanups
    * SAHooks: add a void *pvUserData member. ABI change
    * SAHooks.FOpen and FClose callbacks: add a void *pvUserData parameter. API and ABI change
    * SAHooks.FWrite: make first parameter a const void*. API change
    * Distribute LICENSE-LGPL and LICENSE-MIT files instead of COPYING file. Do not distribute INSTALL file
    * Use standard integer data types
    * Changes to allow building with cmake -DCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON
    * Polygon writing: avoid considering rings slightly overlapping as inner-outer rings of others (refs OSGeo/gdal#5315)
    * Polygon writing: consider rings at non-constant Z as outer rings (fixes OSGeo/gdal#5315) As noted in code comments, this is an approximation of more complicated tests we'd likely have to do, that would take into account real co-planar testing, to allow detecting inner rings of outer rings in an oblique plane.
    * shpopen.c: Communicate why the file size cannot be reached when appending features (OSGeo/gdal#4140) Clearly state why the file size cannot be reached. This is important in order to correctly inform the user and prevent him/her from looking for other reasons. Related to qgis/QGIS#44202
    * SHPWriteObject(): prevent potential overflows on 64-bit platforms on huge geometries
    * SHPRestoreSHX: update SHX content length even if error occurred
    * In creation, uses w+b file opening mode instead of wb followed by r+b, to support network file systems having sequential write only and when using CPL_VSIL_USE_TEMP_FILE_FOR_RANDOM_WRITE=YES (fixes OSGeo/gdal#7801)
    * Fix adding features in a .dbf without columns (fixes qgis/QGIS#51247)
    * Have matching SOVERSION for CMake and autotools
    * Code reformatting
    * Enable contrib/csv2shp build with MSVC
    * Build contributed utilities via CMake
    * Use the the standard BUILD_TESTING CMake variable
    * Remove double free() in contrib/shpsrt (CVE-2022-0699)
    * SHPRestoreSHX: fix for (64 bit) big endian
    * Add config-style support for find_package(shapefile)
    * Prevent no-op FSeeks writing dbf & shp records for network filesystem performance

- Update to version 1.5.0:
  * shpopen.c: resync with GDAL internal shapelib to avoid being
    dependent on correctness of file size field in .shp. Fixes
    https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2018-October/049218.html
  * contrib/shpgeo.h/.c: Remove PROJ.4 dependency and
    functionality, causing removal of SHPProject(),
    SHPSetProjection() and SHPFreeProjection()
  * contrib/shpproj.c: removed
    shpopen.c, dbfopen.c, shptree.c, sbnsearch.c: resyc with GDAL
    internal shapelib. Mostly to allow building those files as C++
    without warning. Also add FTDate entry in DBFFieldType (see
    https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/308). And some other code
    cleanups
  * dbfopen.c: fix a bug where the end of file character was
    written on top of the first character of the first field name
    when deleting a field on a .dbf without records.  Fixes
    https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/863
  * safileio.c: remove duplicate test. Patch by Jaroslav Fojtik.
    Fixes http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2744
