%description
Streamlink is a CLI utility that pipes flash videos
from online streaming services to a variety of video players
such as MPV, or alternatively, a browser.
The main purpose of streamlink is to convert CPU-heavy
flash plugins to a less CPU-intensive format.
Streamlink is a fork of the livestreamer project.
