%description -n libSDL_bgi-devel
SDL_bgi is a Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) emulation library for
SDL. It provides extensions for RGB colors and mouse support.

Unlike other BGI-compatible libraries, the purpose of SDL_bgi is not
full compatibility with BGI. Rather, it is meant to be an
introduction to SDL-based graphics: SDL and BGI commands can be mixed
together.
