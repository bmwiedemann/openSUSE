- update to 3.13.0:
  * Numerous UGens have been fixes so that they calculate their
    initial value as originally intended. Please note that in
    some cases this may create a different result than previously
  * A universal Intel x86_64 and Apple arm64 macOS build is now
    provided
  * This version reverses changes made to MIDI implementation on
    macOS introduced in 3.12.0, which turned out to introduce
    other issues with MIDI.
  * The 3.12.1 release fixes compatibility with older macOS
    systems (10.13 and below). For the list of previous changes,
    see CHANGELOG.md.
  * Supernova is now available on Windows
  * Supercollider is officially supported on Bela platform
  * macOS Big Sur is now fully supported
  * On macOS output signal won't go over the system volume level
  * The `method not found` error in sclang now provides
    suggestions, using fuzzy array comparisons
  * Oppressive terminology has been updated throughout the
    project
  * CI has been updated to use GitHub Actions and now also runs
    our test suite
  * in the help browser, Shift-Enter now evaluates code again!
  * fixed a bug in Pfindur where the last event of the pattern
    could become "Rest-less" (PR 5113).
  * ProxySpace:copy also rebuilds the ProxySpace to copy
    referenced objects (PR 5192).
  * supernova now correctly handles `/s_getn` with a control name
    instead of index (PR 5182).
  * __New feature__ - Ableton Link support. See _sclang: added_
  * Minimum supported Boost version is now 1.66.0 (#4611). Boost
    1.71 is also now supported (#4612).
  * supernova would sometimes return malformed `/done` OSC
    messages over TCP due to a concurrency issue. This has been
    fixed (#4435).
  * Some sequences of IDE actions involving editor splits (such
    as removing a split and then recompiling the class library)
    can lead to an eventual IDE crash. These have been fixed
  * On macOS, Cmd+Q used to quit both the IDE and interpreter,
    but it regressed and only the interpreter would quit. This
    has been fixed (#4300).
  * **Breaking change:** scsynth had a security issue where it
    listens to 0.0.0.0 by default. For most users, this is
    undesirable behavior since it allows anyone on your local
    network to send messages to scsynth! This default has been
    changed to 127.0.0.1 (#4516). To change it back (e.g. for
    networked server/client setups), use `-B 0.0.0.0` at the
    command line or `server.options.bindAddress = "0.0.0.0"`.
  * Fixed crashes trying to run multiple IDEs at once, and a
    related error when attempting to run `HelpBrowser:instance`
    in sclang while an IDE help browser is open (#4267).
  * Fix issues when using a regular `Buffer` (that is, not a
    `LocalBuf`) for FFT (#4050).
  * Fixed class library compilation issues on Qt-less sclang
    installations (#4219).
  * MainMenu consumes less resources and no longer causes a
    gradual memory leak (#3870).
  * Fix SCIDE missing an icon on some Linux desktop environments
    (#4269).
  * Fixed incorrect parsing of strings containing `\"` and
    single-quote symbols containing `\'` in class library files
    (#4255).
  * Fixed language-side issues when using FFT UGens on a regular
    Buffer rather than a LocalBuf (#4050).
  * Added `TempoClock:isRunning` method (#4254).
  * Fixed some compiler warnings (#4275, #4274).
  * Fixed an infinite hang in `SerialPort.devices` affecting
    macOS (#4180).
  * Fixed `ServerOptions` producing eight channels instead of two
    channels when explicitly setting `numOutputBusChannels` or
    `numInputBusChannels` (#4251).
  * Fixed a build issue on OpenBSD (#4203).
  * Fixed `/b_fill`, which was broken in supernova (#4188).
  * Fixed incorrect latency compensation in PortAudio driver
  * The `CheckBadValues` UGen incorrectly recognized zero as a
    bad value on Windows. This has been fixed (#4240).
  * Fixed `crtscts` flag in `SerialPort.new`, which broke in 3.10
  * Fixed lack of `backgroundImage` support for `Slider2D`
  * Fixed incorrect behavior of `String:asSecs` (#3819).
  * `0X0` is an illegal hexadecimal literal in sclang, but SCIDE
    and SCDoc highlighted such strings as if they were correct.
    They have been updated (#4170).
  * Fixed weird colors in SCIDE when changing from other themes
    to the "classic" theme (#4161).
  * sclang and scide now require Qt 5.7+ instead of Qt 5.5. If
    you are building with Qt 5.5, you should upgrade to the
    latest Qt version (5.11 as of this writing). SC can now be
    built on modern versions of Visual Studio and UserView
    supports Retina/HiDPI display.
  * Menus are now supported in the Qt GUI. See help files for
    Menu, MenuAction, ToolBar, and MainMenu.
  * Added wrappers for over 100 special mathematical functions
    (gamma function, Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, etc.)
    from the Boost library.
  * SerialPort now works on Windows.
  * Fixed CPU hog when sclang is built without Qt.
  * Fixed some stray issues on Windows with paths containing non-
    ASCII characters.
