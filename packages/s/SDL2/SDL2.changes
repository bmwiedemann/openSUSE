    renderers when the D3D device is lost, and from Android's event loop when
    the GLES context had to be recreated

    handling* Added a hint SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE to set the stack size of

    window interaction while cursor is hidden
  * Added SDL_GetDisplayDPI() to get the DPI information for a display* Added
    SDL_JoystickCurrentPowerLevel() to get the battery level of a joystick
  * Added SDL_JoystickFromInstanceID(), as a helper function, to get the
    SDL_Joystick* that an event is referring to.
  * Added SDL_GameControllerFromInstanceID(), as a helper function, to get
    the SDL_GameController* that an event is referring to.
