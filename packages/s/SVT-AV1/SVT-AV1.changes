Wed Feb 16 10:01:52 UTC 2022 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Disable forced realtime scheduler priority
  By default, the encoder library will attempt to set realtime
  scheduler priority. Disable this behavior, as it serves no
  practical purpose (video encoding does not benefit from reduced
  process latency) and will only make the system unresponsive.
  (Additionally, it is arguably not a video encoder library’s job
  to manage scheduler priorities for the calling process.)
