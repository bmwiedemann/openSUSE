  <description>storeBackup is a disk-to-disk backup tool for Linux. It should run on
other Unix like machines. You can directly browse through the backuped
files (locally, via NFS, via SAMBA or whatever). This gives the users
the possibility to restore files absolutely easily and fast. He/She
only has to copy (and possibly uncompress) the file. The is also a
tool for easily restoring (sub) trees for the administrator. Every
single backup of a specific time can be deleted without affecting the
other existing backups.

Before you can start using storeBackup, please carefully read
        /usr/share/doc/packages/storeBackup/README
and create an appropriate configuration file
        /etc/storebackup.d/storebackup.config
using
        /usr/share/doc/packages/storeBackup/storebackup.config.default
as a template.
