    <comment>- Update to 1.1.1 version
  * Enhancements and optimizations:
    + WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT no longer grabs the world-lock.
    (COMPILE and COMPILE-FILE still do.)
    + The SPARC backend now supports the precise generational
    (GENCGC) garbage collection. Enabled by default on
    Solaris/SPARC and Linux/SPARC. Thanks to Raymond Toy (via
    CMUCL).
    + add experimental support for the SB-THREAD feature and the
    timer facility on Windows. Thanks to Dmitry Kalyanov and Anton
    Kovalenko. Threads are enabled by default, and this version of
    SBCL is considered to be the last and final release to
    officially support building with threads disabled.
    + The compiler no longer rotates loops in some cases where this
    transformation actually lead to worse code being generated.
  * Bug Fixes:
    + SB-CLTL2:MACROEXPAND-ALL correctly handles shadowing of
    symbol-macros by lexical bindings.
    + stack allocation was prevented by high DEBUG declaration in
    several cases.
    + SB-EXT:GC-LOGFILE signaled an error when no logfile was set.
    (thanks to SANO Masatoshi)
    + PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING performed non-native parsing when
    :JUNK-ALLOWED was true.
    + type derivation inferred overly conservative types for unions
    of array types. (#1050768)
- rebase sbcl-1.0.54-optflags.patch 

- Change licence SUSE-Public_Domain

    <comment>- Update to 1.1.2 version
  * Enhancements:
    + frlocks have been added to SB-CONCURRENCY contrib
      module.
    + New feature sb-dynamic-core allows the runtime to
      be rebuilt or relocated without requiring changes to the core
      file on all linkage table platforms. Required on Windows.
      (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
    + Console I/O streams use UCS-2. (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
    + Support for the experimental safepoint-based stop-the-world
       protocol on the PowerPC platform.
  * Windows related bug fixes:
- Use sbcl in buildrequires instead of clisp since the package is
  now available in Factory as well
  * Added sbclrc.sample and README.openSUSE which explains the usage
    of the sample init file usage with sbcl 
  * Patched install.sh to install the above
    (sbcl-1.1.2-install.patch)
  * use the customize-target-features.lisp to enable/disable
    features
  * disable test-frfrlock sb-concurrency by allowing it to fail on
    linux see https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/1087955

    <time>1365425791</time>
    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.6
  * Enhancements:
    + the continuable error when defknown-ing over extant fndb
      entries can be ignored by passing :overwrite-fndb-silently
      t as a keyword argument to sb-c:defknown (after attributes).
      Useful to allow defknown to be re-loaded. Use with
      :allow-other-keys t for backward compatibility.
  * Optimization:
    + compiler is much faster in compiling SVREF and
      (SETF SVREF) forms.
  * Bug fix:
    + Prevent a make-array transform from modifying source
      forms causing problems for inlined code. Thanks to Bart Botta.
      (regression since 1.0.42.11-bis)
    + clear-output calls the correct gray stream routine,
      sb-gray:stream-clear-output. (lp#1153257)
    + an error is signalled for an invalid format modifier:
      ~&amp;lt;~@&amp;gt;. (lp#1153148)
    + Better error messages for package operations
      (lp#1154776)
    + delete-package on a nonexistent package should signal
      a cerror. (regression since 1.0.37.44).
    + bug fix: accessing &amp;amp;MORE (stack allocated &amp;amp;REST) arguments
      checks bounds.  (lp#1154946, lp#1072112)
    + bug fix: compiling make-array no longer signals an error when
      the element-type is an uknown type, a warning is issued instead.
      Thanks to James Kalenius (lp#1156095)
    + SEARCH on generic (non-VECTOR non-LIST) sequence types
      no longer produces wrong results for some inputs.

    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.7
  * Enhacements:
    + TRACE :PRINT-ALL handles multiple-valued forms. (#457053)
  * Bug Fix:
    + allocation slot option works for condition slots (#1049404)
      redefining conditions does not lead to multiple evaluations of
      hairy slot initfunctions anymore (#1164969)
    + CLASS-DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS now works for condition classes
      (#1164970)
    + function constants now work as initforms and default initarg values
      of conditions (#539517)
      svref/(setf svref) on symbol macros don't crash the compiler
      anymore. (Minimal test case provided by James M. Lawrence on
       sbcl-devel) 
    + no more bogus ## references when pretty printing backquoted forms
      with non-trivial structure sharing. (#1161218)
    + Don't signal an error on (setf (documentation nil 'function) &quot;doc&quot;).
      Signal a style-warning instead when trying to set documentation
      of NIL for all other documentation types.)
    + modular arithmetic involving large constants and conditionals
      should no longer result in spurious dead code elimination.
    + our mach exception handler can seemingly called very early in
      the program execution process on OS X 10.8.0. Try and handle
      that case robustly, without potentially leaking mach ports
      too much.
  * Optimization:
    + LOGBITP and LOGTEST optimizations from x86 portedto x86_64. 
- Backport patches from git (these to be removed on next version

    <time>1370516356</time>
    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.8
  * Notice:
    + The implementation of MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS (the heart of
      ROOM, plus a few SB-INTROSPECT functions) has been completely
      rewritten; it may now exhibit different bugs than before.
  * New feature:
    + minimal runtime/compiler intrastructure support
      for SSE SIMD values, as SB-EXT:SIMD-PACK. Enabled on x86-64
      via the  build-time
     + sb-simd-pack. This should enable intrinsics extensions
       as libraries, without patching SBCL itself. 
  * Enhancement:
    + RUN-PROGRAM supports a :DIRECTORY argument to set
      the working directory of the spawned process.
      (lp#791800) (patch by Matthias Benkard)
    + boxed vectors (vectors of T or of FIXNUM) can now
      be stack-allocated on PPC.
    + &quot;fixed objects&quot; can now be stack-allocated on PPC.
    + WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS no longer conses on PPC/GENCGC.
    + (sb-introspect:find-definition-sources-by-name x :vop) now
      also returns VOPs which do not translate any functions, and
      finds  defoptimizer types ir2convert and stack-allocate-result.
    + better type derivation for APPEND, NCONC, LIST.  (lp#538957)
    + MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS (the heart of ROOM) now walks the heap
      in a manner similar to the GC rather than its previous ad-hoc
      scheme, and is therefore no less and possibly more accurate.
    + fixes and enhancements related to Unicode:
      - the character database information has been updated to
        Unicode 6.2;
      - support for canonical and compatibility decomposition of (forwarded request 177777 from toganm)</comment>

    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.9
  * New feature:
    + the contrib SB-GMP links with libgmp at runtime to speed up
    arithmetic on bignums and ratios. (contributed by Stephan
    Frank)
  * Enhancement:
    + disassemble now annotates some previously
      missing static functions, like LENGTH.
    + SB-EXT:PRINT-SYMBOL-WITH-PREFIX can be used within ~// to
      print a symbol with a package prefix.
    + The debugger and backtracing are more robust against buggy
      PRINT-OBJECT methods.
  * Optimization:
    + calls to static functions on x86-64 use less instructions.
    + compute encode-universal-time at compile time when possible.
    + when referencing internal functions as #'x, don't go through
      an indirect fdefn structure.
    + SLEEP doesn't cons on non-immediate floats and on ratios.
    + (mod fixnum) type-checks are performed using one unsigned
      comparison, instead of two.
    + enable more modular arithmetic transforms in the presence of
     conditionals.
    + bitwise OR forms can now trigger modular arithmetic as well,
      when the result is known to be negative.
    + recognize more cases of useless LOGAND/LOGIOR with constants.
    + comparisons between rationals and constant floats or between
      integers and constant ratios are now converted to rationals/integers
      at compile time.
    + Smaller and faster DOUBLE-FLOAT-LOW-BITS on x86-64.

    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.10
  * Enhancement:
    + ASDF has been updated to 3.0.2.
  * Optimization:
    + stack frames are packed more efficiently on
      x86oids, which  ought to reduce the frequency of Methuselahn
      conservative references (it certainly helps with gc.impure.lisp
      / BUG-936304 on x86).
    + on x86 and x86-64, integer negation forms like
     (- * x) are now recognized in modular arithmetic contexts, and
     compile to native negate, rather than going through bignums only
     to keep the low bits.
  * Bug fix
    + Compiling potential modularic arithmetic forms does
      not cause type errors when some integer types lack lower or upper
      bounds.  (lp#1199127)
    + Non-trivial modular arithmetic forms are always cut to
      the right  bitwidth before being used in a non-modular context.
      (lp#1199428)
    + Multiple catch/unwind blocks in a single function are now
      allocated in the right stack order on win32. (lp#1072739) (forwarded request 184576 from toganm)</comment>

  * Bug fix:
    + probe-file now can access symlinks to pipes and sockets in
     /proc/pid/fd on Linux. (reported by Eric Schulte)
    + SBCL can now be built on Solaris x86-64.

      values.  (lp#309443)
    + other improvements to SXHASH:
      - use the whole of the positive-fixnum range for SXHASH of
        fixnums
  * Enhancement:
    + The error message when calling an undefined alien function
      includes the name of the function on x86-64.
    + sb-ext:run-program now supports :environment on Windows.
    + ASDF is no longer required to load contribs at runtime.
     (lp#1132254)
    + when called with a symbol, FIND-RESTART no longer calls
      COMPUTE-RESTARTS, making it faster and cons less (lp#769615)

      clusters better in some cases

      (lp#503095)
    + run-sbcl.sh is usefully handled by rlwrap.  Thanks

    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.15
  * New feature:
    the iterative spilling/coloring register allocator developed
    by Alexandra Barchunova during Google Summer of Code 2013 is
    now merged in. By default, it only activates for functions that
    optimize with (speed 3) and (&amp;gt; speed compilation-speed), but
    setting sb-regalloc:*register-allocation-method* to :iterative
    forces its execution. The previous behaviour can be obtained by
    instead setting that variable to :greedy.
  * Optimization:
    + make-array with known element-type and unknown dimensions is
      much faster.
    + make-array with unknown element-type is faster as well.
     (lp#1004501)
  * Enhancement:
    + reduced conservativism on GENCGC platforms: conservative roots
       must be valid-looking tagged pointers or point within a code
       object, not merely point to within the allocated part of a
       page, in order to pin a page.
    + support for &quot;Mac Roman&quot; external format.
    + encapsulation of named generic functions now happens without
      altering the identity of the function bound to the name.
  * Bug fix:
    + modular arithmetic optimizations do not stumble on dead branches
      with bad constants. (reported by Douglas Katzman)
    + CLISP can be used again as a cross-compilation host.
      (Thanks to Vasily Postnicov, lp#1261451)

    <comment>- Update to version 1.1.16
  * Enhancement
    +  SB-EXT:DEFINE-LOAD-TIME-GLOBAL. (lp#1253688)
    +  Loading fasls with symbols from an undefined package includes
      the name of the symbol in the error message.
  * Bug fix
    + problems when redefining classes and doing TYPEP on classes
      concurrently. (lp#1272742)
    + fixes to the x86-64 XCHG instruction:
      - it was misencoded when used with RAX, R8-R15 registers.
       (reported by  Eric Marsden)
      - it was misencoded when used to exchange EAX with itself.
      - the disassembler wrongly printed XCHG RAX, R8 and the
        corresponding 32- and 16-bit variations as NOP.
    + the disassembler outputs source annotations in the right place
      and no longer randomly drops some of them. (lp#1249205)
    + fix commutative-arg-swap from introducing undumpable structures
      into code, prevent code with errors from being compiled.
      (lp#1276282)

      succeffully resolved.
    + the deterministic profiler now uses ENCAPSULATE functionality
      to wrap functions around. (lp#309086) (forwarded request 224330 from toganm)</comment>

      ages, causing compilation problems since 1.1.13.x due to
      smarter TYPEP type propagation reported by jasom in #lisp).

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.5
  * Enhancement
   +  sb-bsd-sockets now has basic support for IPv6
   + An sb-unicode package has been added, containing
     many functions related to handling Unicode text
   + The reader now normalizes symbols to Normalization
     Form KC (NFKC). This behavior can be disabled with
     SB-EXT:READTABLE-NORMALIZATION
   + enhancement: a style-warning is signaled if OPTIMIZE
     declarations multiply specify a quality with differing values.
     (lp#310267)
  * Bug fix:
    + conservatively pointed to pages wipe out unused dwords
      so that they cannot act as false roots in turn.
    + the walker's handling of lexical variable and
      symbol-macro bindings is improved (lp#375326, lp#1368305)
    + HANDLER-{BIND,CASE} no longer drop into ldb when a
      clause contains an undefined condition type; regression
      in 1.1.19( lp#1378939)
    + in interpreted code, inequality predicates did not
      type-check arguments that weren't examined, and a 1-argument use
      of MIN or MAX accepted a complex number. (lp#1373702)
    + APROPOS and APROPOS-LIST handle inherited symbols correctly.

    <time>1417643296</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.6
  * enhancement:
    + SERVE-EVENTS uses the poll() system call in lieu
      of select() if the OS has the former. Previously poll() was
      used only if waiting on exactly one file descriptor.
    + efficiency of access to untagged structure slots
      is improved on x86-64, and the order of slots in memory is
      exactly as specified by defstruct, simplifying use of
      structures as arguments to foreign calls.
  * bug fix:
    + SB-DEBUG:ARG now works in all TRACE options which
      evaluate forms. (lp#1357826)
    + GC memory corruption during internal memory handling.
    + duplicate effective-slot-definition objects as compared
      by EQ on name could be present in CLASS-SLOTS of a class whose
      metaclass was structure-class or condition-class. (lp#1049423)
    + HANDLER-BIND with empty bindings works again; regression in
      1.2.5. (lp#1388707)
    + ATOMIC-INCF works on structure slots in interpreted code.
      (lp#1381867)
    + MAKE-ARRAY properly handles character types like (eql
      #\a) and (member #\a #\c). (lp#1392068)

      character after a token when it should not have. (lp#327790) (forwarded request 263736 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.7
  * Optimization:
    + returning constant values refers to preboxed
      constants more reliably. (lp#1398785)
  * Enhancement:
    + STYLE-WARNING is produced if a compiler-macro is
      defined for a function after at least one ordinary (not inlined)
      call to that function was compiled, indicating a likely
      compilation order problem. Likewise a warning ensues if a call
      is compiled to a function that is subsequently proclaimed INLINE.
    + always lose() when something goes wrong while saving a core
      (instead of just printing an error on stderr in some situations).
    + frames in the debugger are now restartable by default.
  * Bug Fix:
    + restore error handling on Windows x86.
    + MAKE-SEQUENCE detects type errors in its :INITIAL-ELEMENT
      at compile-time when possible. (lp#330299)
    + parsing of malformed type specifiers no longer results in a
      memory-fault-error.
    + LOOP properly destructures nested lists in WITH.
    + MACROEXPANDing the redefinition of an alien structure type no
      longer signals the wrong error.
    + PROGV doesn't get confused by forced DEBUG 3 (lp#1405456). (forwarded request 280514 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.8
  * Enhancement:
    +better error and warning messages. (lp#1314767,
      lp#736383)
    + backtrace for invalid argument count produces the
      exact supplied arguments including the extra ones, on x86,
      x86-64 and ARM.
    + STYLE-WARNING is signaled for DEFSTRUCT accessors which
      are used before the structure is defined; similarly for the
      predicate.
  * Optimization
    + FORMAT NIL with only ~a and string arguments is transformed
      into CONCATENATE.
    + POSITION and FIND when inlined into code that is compiled
      with qualities of safety &amp;lt; 2 and speed &amp;gt; space will no longer
      signal an error on circular lists, but will potentially loop
      forever if given no :END constraint. As was always the case,
      calls that are not inlined are safe regardless of lexical
      policy.
  * Bug Fix:
    + CLOS methods compiled with (OPTIMIZE (DEBUG 0))no longer
      cause debugger failure when printing a backtrace
    + more resilience to deleted code. (lp#1308328, lp#1390544)
    + the CLHS example of MAKE-LOAD-FORM involving TREE-WITH-PARENT
      did not work, and now it does. (forwarded request 283619 from toganm)</comment>

  * Bug Fix:
    + minor incompatible change and bug fix: unboxed numeric
      constants on x86oids are arranged in memory differently, and
      the disassembler  does not show them separately in DISASSEMBLE,
      but does if DISASSEMBLE-CODE-COMPONENT is used. (lp#1421987)
    + DEFCLASS handles cyclic {super,meta}class relations better
     (lp#1418883)
    + compiler no longer signals an error when compiling certain
      function calls. (lp#1416704, lp#404441, lp#1417822, lp#1234919)
    + compiler doesn't stumble on a LOGIOR transform.
     (lp#1389433)
    + more robust debugger and backtraces. (lp#1413850,
      lp#1099500,  lp#1412881, lp#945261, lp#1419205, lp#1409402)
    + files larger than 4GB can now be compiled.
    + x86 truncated results from 64-bit foreign functions to
      32 bits.
    + file-position didn't work on large files on win32.
      (lp#1271545)
    + callbacks from foreign threads can work without enabling
      sb-safepoint.
    + sb-introspect:function-lambda-list works properly on
      interpeted macros. (lp#1387404)
    + ADJUST-ARRAY properly handles non-adjustable arrays.
      (lp#886418)

    <time>1427983486</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.10
*  One thing that is not mentioned in the release notes, but which
   has been exercising developers recently, is a warning for the near
   future: some interfaces which are currently in &quot;early&quot; deprecation
   status (and so are emitting style-warnings at compilation-time) 
   will in the next release cycle or two start emitting full warnings,
   either at compilation time or at load time.  Particular interfaces
   signalling warnings causing problems to some users include:
   SB-EXT:QUIT, and the SB-THREAD:SPINLOCK API.  If anyone is using
   those, now is the time to update to SB-EXT:EXIT and
   SB-THREAD:MUTEX respectively.  (See also the &quot;Deprecated Interfaces&quot;
   chapter in the manual).
  * minor incompatible change:
    + all SOCKINT::WIN32-* functions have been deprecated with
      EARLY deprecation state
    + performing introspection via the system-internal SB-INT:INFO
      function could expose that :TYPE :TRANSLATOR is not
      necessarily a function, as it always was before. (Affects
      swank-fancy-inspector)
  * enhancement:
    + The value of SXHASH on bit-vectors of length equal to the
      word size now depends on the vector's contents instead of
      being constant; its value on bit-vectors of length divisible
      by the word size now depends also on the contents of the
      vector's last word.
  * bug-fix:
    + sb-bsd-sockets on win32 uses proper C function declarations.
      (lp#1426667)
    + A new dead code elimination phase removes dead code loops
      that confuse stack analysis. (lp#1255782, lp#308914) (forwarded request 294077 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.11
  * Enhancement:
    + SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH will warn when given an expression in
      which any part is unrecognizable as a legal type-specifier.
      The dispatch table will be altered, but the new entry is 
      disabled. Subsequent type-defining forms will cause
      pprint-dispatch tables to  re-examine whether any disabled
       entries should be enabled. (lp#1429520)
    + Loading code containing calls to a deprecated  function will,
      under most circumstances, signal warnings similar to compiling
      such code.  The usual caveat holds about not detecting calls
      through a computed name, as in (funcall
      (intern &quot;DEPRECATED-FUN&quot; &quot;SB-EXT&quot;)).
    + (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-LINE) is a new macro that expands to a
      constant (VALUES integer integer) indicating the source 
      line/column from which it was read, intended for logging Lisp
      runtime errors in a style similar to that afforded by the C
      preprocessor __LINE__ macro. Similarly
      (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-POSITION) returns a position in characters.
    + improved source locations for VOPs, alien types and declarations.
  * Bug fix:
    + Functions in :FINAL deprecation have the correct docstring.
      No visible change, as no such functions presently exist.
      (lp#1439151)
    + (SETF (FDEFINITION this) (FDEFINITION OTHER)) signals an error
      if OTHER names either a macro or special-operator. (lp#1439921)

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.13
  * Incompatible change:
    + on success, TRY-SEMAPHORE and WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE return the new
      count
  * Enhancement:
    + WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE accepts a decrement parameter
    + JOIN-THREAD allows distinguishing timeout vs.
      abort in all situations
    + On Windows DBG_PRINTEXCEPTION_C is handled and its
      message is printed. (#1437947)
  * Bug-fix:
    + TRUENAME works properly on broken symlinks presented
      as directories. (#1458164)
    + Inlined DPB and DEPOSIT-FIELD don't interfere with
      left-to-right order of argument evaluation. (#1458190)
    + (SETF (LDB (BYTE 1 2 JUNK) X) 0) is rightly rejected.
    + DEFSETF lambda lists should not permit argument
      destructuring.
    + calls to (SETF SLOT-VALUE) on a missing slot would in
      certain situations incorrectly return the result of a
      SLOT-MISSING method instead of always returning the new
      value. (#1460381)
    + a DEFMACRO occurring not at toplevel and capturing
      parts of its lexical environment (thus being a closure)
      caused expressions involving the macro name to cause corruption
      in the pretty-printer due to faulty introspection of the lambda
      list of a closure.
    + out of line MAP/MAP-INTO check that the results produced by the
      function are of the matching sequence type. (#1459581)
    + pretty-printing of '(LET `((,X ,Y)) :B) is handled correctly. (forwarded request 316611 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 2.0.0
  * minor incompatible change: heap relocation now works on Windows.  Since
    this feature now works on all platforms, it is enabled unconditionally and
    the :RELOCATABLE-HEAP symbol no longer appears on *FEATURES* in any
    builds.  (Thanks to Luís Borges de Oliveira)
  * enhancement: malformed type specifiers and occurrences of deprecated types
    in :TYPE initargs of DEFCLASS and DEFINE-CONDITION slot specifications
    are detected and result in compile-time errors and warnings respectively.
  * enhancement: parallel contrib building, controlled by SBCL_MAKE_JOBS=-jX
    the same as for the C runtime.
  * bug fix: add a walker template for WITH-SOURCE-FORM.
  * bug fix: start the summary of a compilation unit on a fresh line.  (Thanks
    to Zach Beane)
  * bug fix: on Windows, PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING produces an absolute
    directory when parsing a bare drive name and :AS-DIRECTORY is specified.
    (Thanks to Luís Borges de Oliveira)
  * bug fix: on RISCV, the runtime is linked with libz if the core compression
    feature is requested.  (Thanks to Andreas Schwab)
  * bug fix: ADJOIN using an EQL test and a KEY function only transforms into
    an EQ test if the key function returns values for which EQ and EQL are
    guaranteed to be the same.
  * optimizations:
    ** the instruction sequence for multiple-value calls is more
       efficient on x86-64.
    ** the direction flag is now unused on x86 and x86-64 when handling
       an unknown number of return values.  (Thanks to Fanael Linithien)
    ** the x86-64 backend is better able to use memory operands for arithmetic
       operations.
    ** compilation of TYPECASE to a jump table is enabled when all the types
       being tested are frozen.</comment>
