You may want to use the sbclrc.sample with sbcl. Todo so you need to
copy it to $HOME/.sbclrc or /etc/sbclrc if you want it system wide.

This sbclrc provides an AllegroCL style Read-Eval-Print Loop for
SBCL. An AllegroCL style inspector is integrated and handles fasl
recompilation automatically for ASDF-based systems
(for more details see the sbcl info 2.3.2 FASL)
