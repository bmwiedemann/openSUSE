.SH NAME
syslog - the system logging service
.SH DESCRIPTION
There are different syslog daemon implementations
supported as the system's syslog service, currently:
.BR syslogd ,
.BR rsyslogd ,
.BR syslog-ng .

It depends on the software selection during the installation
which daemon is installed as default.

Each syslog-daemon provides an own service file, that is:
.BR syslogd.service ,
.BR rsyslogd.service ,
.BR syslog-ng.service .

Only one syslog-daemon can be installed, it activates itself as the syslog
service by creating the
.BR syslog.service
alias, a common name to start/stop, query status and reload the daemon while
log rotation.

The
.BR /etc/sysconfig/syslog
file contains several variables allowing to specify additional
settings, such as start parameters for the daemon or additional
chroot log sockets.
The \fIyast2 sysconfig\fR module provides a comfortable way to
change these settings.

Starting with openSUSE-12.3, the
.BR SYSLOG_DAEMON
variable, which was used to select the daemon before, has been
removed. Also the
.BR SYSLOG_REQUIRES_NETWORK
has been removed and each daemon declares in its service file
whether the network will be started before syslog or not.
