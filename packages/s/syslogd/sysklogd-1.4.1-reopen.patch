#
# Description: reconnects to log socket if a write fails with
#              ECONNREFUSED or ENOTCONN -- similar to reopen
#              in syslog routines provided by glibc.
#              Happens if the log socket (provided by syslog
#              daemon) has been reopened. Can be triggered by
#              "rcsyslog reload" while syslog-ng is used.
#              See also Bugzilla Bug #27971.
