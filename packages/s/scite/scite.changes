Thu Jul 15 06:22:46 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 5.1.0:
* Add SciFnDirectStatus, a direct access function which also returns status.
  It can be retrieved with SCI_GETDIRECTSTATUSFUNCTION.
  This can avoid calling SCI_GETSTATUS after every API to determine
  failure so can improve performance.
* Add more type-safe wrappers to the API. These are defined in
  include/ScintillaCall.h and implemented in call/ScintillaCall.cxx.
  ScintillaCall throws Scintilla::Failure exceptions when a call fails.
* Add APIs for setting appearance (traditional blob or plain text) and
  colour of representations and support setting a representation
  for the "\r\n" line end sequence.
* Add SCI_REPLACERECTANGULAR to insert text like a rectangular paste.
* Fixed bug with SCI_GETLASTCHILD. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  3 23:01:24 UTC 2021 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

      detection of whether the previous line had content which
      treated '\n' and '\r\n' line endings differently.
    * Update to Unicode 13, Feature #1379.
  + A more type-safe binding of Scintilla's API that can be used
    from C++ is implemented in the ScintillaTypes.h,
    ScintillaMessages.h, and ScintillaStructures.h headers.
  + Change the way that selections and carets are drawn to use the
    element APIs.
  + Change caret line drawing to use SC_ELEMENT_CARET_LINE_BACK
    element and SCI_SETCARETLINELAYER method.
  + Add SCI_MARKERSETLAYER to define layer on which to draw content
    area markers. This replaces the use of SC_ALPHA_NOALPHA for
    markers.
  + Add SC_ELEMENT_WHITE_SPACE to set the colour of visible
    whitespace including translucency.
  + Add elements for hot spots SC_ELEMENT_HOT_SPOT_ACTIVE and
    SC_ELEMENT_HOT_SPOT_ACTIVE_BACK.
  + Add SCI_GETELEMENTBASECOLOUR to return the default values for
    element colours.
  + Make idle actions wrapping and background styling smoother by
    measuring per-byte instead of per-line and allowing just one
    line to be processed in a time slice. Very long lines will not
    distort estimation or block interaction as much. Feature #1373.
  + Include modifiers in SCN_INDICATORRELEASE notification,
    Bug #2254.
  + Update to Unicode 13, Feature #1379.
  + On GTK 3 with Wayland, fix primary selection, Bug #2227.

Sat Apr 15 03:05:21 UTC 2017 - luke.nukem.jones@gmail.com

- Update to 3.7.4
  + Requires a C++11 compiler. GCC 4.8 and MSVC 2015 are supported.
  + Support dropped for Windows NT 4.
  + Accessibility support may be queried with SCI_GETACCESSIBILITY.
    On GTK+, accessibility may be disabled by calling
    SCI_SETACCESSIBILITY.
  + Lexer added for "indent" language which is styled as plain text
    but folded by indentation level.
  + The Progress ABL lexer handles nested comments where comment
    starts or ends are adjacent like "/*/*" or "*/*/".
  + In the Python lexer, improve f-string support. Add support for
    multiline expressions in triple quoted f-strings. Handle nested
    "()", "[]", and "{}" in f-string expressions and terminate
    expression coloring at ":" or "!". End f-string if ending quote
    is seen in a "{}" expression. Fix terminating single quoted
    f-string at EOL, (sf#1918).
  + The VHDL folder folds an "entity" on the first line of the file.
  + For IMEs, do not clear selected text when there is no
    composition text to show.
  + Fix to crash with fold tags where line inserted at start.
  + Fix to stream selection mode when moving caret up or down,
    sf(#1905).
  + Drawing fixes for fold tags include fully drawing lines and not
    overlapping some drawing and ensuring edges and mark underlines
    are visible.
  + Fix Cocoa failure to display accented character chooser for
    European languages by partially reverting a change made to
    prevent a crash with Chinese input by special-casing the
    Cangjie input source. (sf#1881).
  + Fix potential problems with IME on Cocoa when document contains
    invalid UTF-8.
  + Fix crash on Cocoa with OS X 10.9 due to accessibility API not
    available, (sf#1915).
  + Improved speed of accessibility code on GTK+ by using
    additional memory as a cache, (sf#1910).
  + Fix crash in accessibility code on GTK+ < 3.3.6 caused by
    previous bug fix, (sf#1907).
  + Fix to prevent double scrolling on GTK+ with X11, (sf#1901).
  + SciTE on GTK+ adds an "accessibility" property to allow
    disabling accessibility on GTK+ as an optimization.
  + SciTE on GTK+ has changed file chooser behaviour for some
    actions: overwriting an existing file shows a warning; the
    default session file name "SciTE.session" is shown and a
    "*.session" filter is applied; appropriate filters are
    applied when exporting; the current file name is displayed in
    "Save As" even when that file no longer exists.
  + SciTE fixed a bug where, on GTK+, when the output pane had
    focus, menu commands performed by mouse were sent instead to
    the edit pane.
  + SciTE on Windows 8+ further restricts the paths searched for
    DLLs to the application and system directories which may
    prevent some binary planting attacks.
  + Fix failure to load Direct2D on Windows when used on old
    versions of Windows, (sf#1653).

- Changes in version 3.7.3
  + Display block caret over the character at the end of a
    selection to be similar to other editors.
  + In SciTE can choose colours for fold markers, (sf#1172).
  + In SciTE can hide buffer numbers in tabs, (sf#1173).
  + The Diff lexer recognizes deleted lines that start with "--- ".
  + The Lua lexer requires the first line to start with "#!" to be
    treated as a shebang comment, not just "#", (sf#1900).
  + The Matlab lexer requires block comment start and end to be
    alone on a line, (sf#1902).
  + The Python lexer supports f-strings with new styles, allows
    Unicode identifiers, and no longer allows @1 to be a decorator,
    (sf#1848).
  + Fix folding inconsistency when fold header added above a folded
    part. Avoid unnecessary unfolding when a deletion does not
    include a line end, (sf#1896).
  + Fix finalization crash on Cocoa, (sf#1909).
  + SciTE on GTK+ can have a wide divider between the panes with
    the split.wide property.
  + Fix display of autocompletion lists and calltips on GTK+ 3.22
    on Wayland. Newer APIs used on GTK+ 3.22 as older APIs were
    deprecated.
  + Fix crash in accessibility code on GTK+ due to signal receipt
    after destruction, (sf#1907).
  + Make trackpad scrolling work on Wayland, (sf#1901). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  7 15:35:15 UTC 2017 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 3.7.2:
  + Minimize redrawing for SCI_SETSELECTIONN* APIs, (sf#1888).
  + Use more precision to allow selecting individual lines in files
    with more than 16.7 million lines.
  + Fix crash on GTK+ <3.8 due to incorrect lifetime of
    accessibility object. More accurate reporting of attribute
    ranges and deletion lengths for accessibility.
  + In SciTE, if a Lua script causes a Scintilla failure exception,
    display error message in output pane instead of exiting,
    (sf#1773).
- Changes from version 3.7.1:
  + The Scintilla namespace is no longer applied to struct
    definitions in Scintilla.h even when SCI_NAMESPACE defined.
    Client code should not define SCI_NAMESPACE.
  + Structure names in Scintilla.h without prefixes are deprecated
    and will now only be usable with INCLUDE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES
    defined. Use the newer names with the "Sci_" prefix:
    * CharacterRange ‚Üí Sci_CharacterRange.
    * TextRange ‚Üí Sci_TextRange.
    * TextToFind ‚Üí Sci_TextToFind.
    * RangeToFormat ‚Üí Sci_RangeToFormat.
    * NotifyHeader ‚Üí Sci_NotifyHeader.
  + Previously deprecated features SC_CP_DBCS, SCI_SETUSEPALETTE
    and SCI_GETUSEPALETTE have been removed and can no longer be
    used in client code.
  + Accessibility support allowing screen readers to work added on
    GTK+.
  + Textual tags may be displayed to the right on folded lines with
    SCI_TOGGLEFOLDSHOWTEXT. This is commonly something like
    "{ ... }" or "<tr>...</tr>". It is displayed with the
    STYLE_FOLDDISPLAYTEXT style and may have a box drawn around it
    with SCI_FOLDDISPLAYTEXTSETSTYLE.
  + A mouse right-click over the margin may send an
    SCN_MARGINRIGHTCLICK event. This only occurs when popup menus
    are turned off. SCI_USEPOPUP now has three states:
    SC_POPUP_NEVER, SC_POPUP_ALL, or SC_POPUP_TEXT.
  + INDIC_POINT and INDIC_POINTCHARACTER indicators added to
    display small arrows underneath positions or characters.
  + Added alternate appearance for visible tabs which looks like a
    horizontal line. Controlled with SCI_SETTABDRAWMODE,
    Feature #1165.
  + Baan folder accommodates sections and lexer fixes definition of
    SCE_BAAN_FUNCDEF.
  + EDIFACT lexer and folder added, Feature #1166.
  + JSON folder fixed where it didn't resume folding with the
    correct fold level.
  + Matlab folder based on syntax instead of indentation so more
    accurate (sf#1692).
  + YAML lexer fixed style of references and keywords when followed
    by a comment, (sf#1872).
  + Margin click to select line now clears rectangular and
    additional selections.
  + Fixed a NULL access bug on GTK+ where the scrollbars could be
    used during destruction, (sf#1873).
  + A potential bug on GTK+ fixed where asynchronous clipboard
    could be delivered after its target Scintilla instance was
    destroyed.
  + SciTE on GTK+ allows localising tool bar tool tips,
    Feature #1167.
  + SciTE measures files larger that 2 GB which allows it to refuse
    to open huge files more consistently and to show better warning
    messages.
- Changes from version 3.7.0:
  + Word selection, navigation, and manipulation is now performed
    on characters instead of bytes leading to more natural
    behaviour for multi-byte encodings like UTF-8. For UTF-8
    characters 0x80 and above, classification into word;
    punctuation; space; or line-end is based on the Unicode general
    category of the character and is not customizable, (sf#1832).
  + Two enums changed in Scintilla.iface which may lead to changed
    bindings. There were 2 FontQuality enums and the first is now
    PhasesDraw. The prefix for FoldAction was SC_FOLDACTION and is
    now SC_FOLDACTION_ which is similar to other enums. These
    changes do not affect the standard C/C++ binding.
  + EDGE_MULTILINE and SCI_MULTIEDGEADDLINE added to allow
    displaying multiple vertical edges simultaneously.
  + The number of margins can be changed with SCI_SETMARGINS.
  + Margin type SC_MARGIN_COLOUR added so that the application may
    choose any colour for a margin with SCI_SETMARGINBACKN.
  + The WordList class in lexlib used by lexers adds an
    InListAbridged method for matching keywords that have
    particular prefixes and/or suffixes.
  + The Baan lexer was changed significantly with more lexical
    states, keyword sets, and support for abridged keywords.
  + The Progress lexer "progress" has been replaced with a new
    lexer "abl" (Advanced Business Language) with a different set
    of lexical states and more functionality. The lexical state
    prefix has changed from SCE_4GL_ to SCE_ABL_, Feature #1143.
  + The YAML lexer recognizes inline comments, (sf#1660).
  + Fix caret position after left or right movement with
    rectangular selection, (sf#1861).
  + In SciTE, optional prefix argument added to scite.ConstantName
    method, (sf#1860).
  + On GTK+ 3.21+ fix incorrect font size in auto-completion list,
    (sf#1859).
  + Fix SciTE crash when command.mode ends with comma, (sf#1857).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 00:03:38 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 3.6.7:
  + C++11 range-based for loops used in SciTE so GCC 4.6 is now the
    minimum supported version.
  + SCVS_NOWRAPLINESTART option stops left arrow from wrapping to
    the previous line. Most commonly wanted when virtual space is
    used, (sf#1648).
  + The C++ lexer can fold on #else and #elif with the
    fold.cpp.preprocessor.at.else property, (sf#210).
  + The HTML lexer no longer treats "<?" inside a string in a
    script as potentially starting an XML document, (sf#767).
  + The HTML lexer fixes a problem resuming at a script start where
    the starting state continued past where it should, (sf#1849).
  + When inserting spaces for virtual space and the position is in
    indentation and tabs are enabled for indentation then use tabs,
    (sf#1850).
  + Fix fold expand when some child text not styled. Caused by
    fixes for #1799, (sf#1842).
  + Fix scroll bar size warnings on GTK+ caused by #1831, (sf#1851).
  + Small fixes for GTK+ makefile, (sf#1844, sf#1845 and sf#1846).
  + Fix SciTE indentation after code like "void function () {}".
  + Fix SciTE global regex replace of "^" with something which
    missed the line after empty lines with LF line ends, (sf#1839).
  + Fix SciTE on GTK+ 3.20 bug where toggle buttons on find and
    replace strips did not show active state, (sf#1853).
- Changes from version 3.6.6:
  + C++ 11 <regex> support built by default. Can be disabled by
    defining NO_CXX11_REGEX.
  + SciTE_USERHOME environment variable allows separate location
    for writeable properties files, Feature #965.
  + GObject introspection supports notify and command events.
  + The Progress lexer now allows comments preceded by a tab.
  + Scripts reading Scintilla.iface file include comments for enu
    and lex definitions, (sf#1829).
  + Fix crashes on GTK+ if idle work active when destroyed,
    (sf#1827).
  + Fixed bugs when used on GTK+ 3.20, (sf#1825 and sf#1831).
  + Fix SciTE search field background with dark theme on GTK+
    2.x,(sf#1826).
- Changes from version 3.6.5:
  + JSON lexer added, Feature #1140.
  + The C++ lexer fixes a bug with multi-line strings with line
    continuation where the string style overflowed after an edit,
    (sf#1824).
  + The Python lexer treats '@' as an operator except when it is
    the first visible character on a line. This is for Python 3.5.
  + The Rust lexer allows '?' as an operator, Feature #1146.
  + Doubled size of compiled regex buffer, (sf#1822).
  + For GTK+, the Super modifier key can be used in key bindings,
    Feature #1142.
  + For GTK+, fix some crashes when using multiple threads.
  + Platform layer font cache removed on GTK+ as platform-
    independent caches are used. This avoids the use of thread
    locking and initialisation of threads so any GTK+ applications
    that rely on Scintilla initialising threads will have to do
    that themselves.
  + SciTE bug fixed with exported HTML where extra line shown,
    (sf#1816).

Fri Mar 18 14:06:08 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.6.4:
  + SciTE allows setting the autocompletion type separator
    character.
  + The C++ folder folds code on '(' and ')' to allow multi-line
    calls to be folded, Feature #1138.
  + For the HTML lexer, limit the extent of Mako line comments to
    finish before the line end characters.
  + Folds unfolded when two fold regions are merged by either
    deleting an intervening line or changing its fold level by
    adding characters. This was fixed both in Scintilla and in
    SciTE's equivalent code, (sf#1799).
  + The Progress lexer supports hexadecimal numeric literals,
    single-line comments, abbreviated keywords and extends nested
    comments to unlimited levels.
  + Ruby lexer treats alternate hash key syntax "key:" as a symbol,
    (sf#1810).
  + Rust lexer handles bracketed Unicode string escapes like
    "\u{123abc}", (sf#1809).
  + For Qt, release builds have assertions turned off.
  + For SciTE, more descriptive error messages are displayed when
    there are problems loading the Lua startup script,
    Feature #1139.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  5 22:07:41 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.6.3:
  + Allow painting without first styling all visible text then
    styling in the background using idle-time. This helps
    performance when scrolling down in very large documents. Can
    also incrementally style after the visible area to the end of
    the document so that the document is already styled when the
    user scrolls to it.
  + Support GObject introspection on GTK+.
  + SciTE supports pasting to each selection with the
    selection.multipaste setting, Feature #1123.
  + SciTE can optionally display a read-only indicator on tabs and
    in the Buffers menu.
  + Bash lexer flags incomplete here doc delimiters as syntax
    errors (sf#1789).
  + Support added for using '#' in non-comment ways as is possible
    with zsh (sf#1794).
  + Recognize more characters as here-doc delimiters (sf#1778).
  + Errorlist lexer fixes bug with final line in escape sequence
    recognition mode.
  + Lua lexer includes '&' and '|' bitwise operators for Lua 5.3
    (sf#1790).
  + Perl lexer updated for Perl 5.20 and 5.22.
  + Allow '_' for subroutine prototypes (sf#1791).
  + Double-diamond operator <<>>.
  + Hexadecimal floating point literals.
  + Repetition in list assignment (sf#1793).
  + Highlight changed subroutine prototype syntax for Perl 5.20
    (sf#1797).
  + Fix module ::-syntax when special characters such as 'x' are
    used.
  + Added ' and " detection as prefix chars for x repetition
    operator (sf#1800).
  + Visual Prolog lexer recognizes numbers more accurately and
    allows non-ASCII verbatim quoting characters, Feature #1130.
  + Send SCN_UPDATEUI with SC_UPDATE_SELECTION when the application
    changes multiple selection.
  + Expand folded areas before deleting fold header line
    (sf#1796).
  + Treat Unicode line ends like common line ends when maintaining
    fold state.
  + Highlight whole run for hover indicator when wrapped (sf#1784).
  + On GTK+ and Qt, Korean input by word fixed.
  + On GTK+, Qt, and Win32 block IME input when document is
    read-only or any selected text is protected.
  + On GTK+ on OS X, fix warning during destruction (sf#1777).
  + Fix SciTE crashes when using LPEG lexers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  1 01:05:55 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.6.2:
  + Whitespace may be made visible just in indentation.
  + Whitespace dots are centred when larger than 1 pixel.
  + The Scintilla framework on Cocoa now contains version numbers.
  + SciTE's standard properties collect values from all active
    .properties file to produce the Language menu and the file
    types pull-down in the File open dialog.
  + The single executable version of SciTE, Sc1, uses 'module'
    statements within its embedded properties. This makes it act
    more like the full distribution allowing languages to be turned
    on and off by setting imports.include and imports.exclude. The
    default imports.exclude property adds eiffel, erlang, ps, and
    pov so these languages are turned off by default.
  + SciTE adds an output.blank.margin.left property to allow
    setting the output pane margin to a different width than the
    edit pane.
  + Markdown lexer treats line starts consistently to always
    highlight *foo* or similar at line start (sf#1766).
  + Optimise marker redrawing by only drawing affected lines when
    markers shown in the text.
  + On GTK+ 2.x, fix height of lines in autocompletion lists
    (sf#1774).
  + Fix bug with SCI_LINEENDDISPLAY where the caret moved to the
    next document line instead of the end of the display line
    (sf#1772).
  + Report error (SC_STATUS_FAILURE) when negative length passed to
    SCI_SETSTYLING (sf#1768).
  + When SC_MARK_UNDERLINE is not assigned to a margin, stop
    drawing the whole line.
  + When reverting an untitled document in SciTE, just clear it
    with no message about a file (sf#1764).
  + SciTE on GTK+ allows use of Ctrl+A (Select All) inside find and
    replace strips (sf#1769).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  4 14:29:33 UTC 2015 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.6.1:
  + The oldest version of GTK+ supported now is 2.18 and for glib
    it is 2.22.
  + On GTK+, SC_CHARSET_OEM866 added to allow editing Russian files
    encoded in code page 866, Feature #1019.
  + The errorlist lexer understands some ANSI escape sequences to
    change foreground colour and intensity. This is sufficient to
    colour diagnotic output from gcc and clang when
    -fdiagnostics-color set.
  + The errorlist lexer allows the line number to be 0 in GCC
    errors as some tools report whole file errors as line 0.
  + MySql lexer fixes empty comments /**/ so the comment state does
    not continue.
  + VHDL folder supports "protected" keyword.
  + Treat CRLF line end as two characters in SCI_COUNTCHARACTERS
    (sf#1757).
  + On GTK+ 3.x, fix height of lines in autocompletion lists to
    match the font. Switch from deprecated style calls to CSS
    styling. Removed setting list colours on GTK+ 3.16+ as no
    longer appears needed.
  + On GTK+, avoid "Invalid rectangle passed" warning messages by
    never reporting the client rectangle with a negative width or
    height.
  + Fix SciTE disk exhaustion bug by reporting failures when
    writing files (sf#1760).
  + On GTK+ the keyboard command for View | End of Line was changed
    to Ctrl+Shift+N to avoid clash with Search | Selection Add
    Next (sf#1750).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  5 21:04:53 UTC 2015 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.6.0:
  + External interfaces use the Sci_Position and Sci_PositionU
    typedefs instead of int and unsigned int to allow for changes
    to a 64-bit interface on 64-bit plactforms in the future.
    Applications and external lexers should start using the new
    type names so that they will be compatible when the 64-bit
    change occurs. There is also Sci_PositionCR (long) for use in 
    the Sci_CharacterRange struct which will also eventually become
    64-bit.
  + Multiple selection now works over more key commands. The new
    multiple-selection handling commands include horizontal
    movement and selection commands, line up and down movement and
    selection commands, word and line deletion commands, and line
    end insertion. This change in behaviours is conditional on
    setting the SCI_SETADDITIONALSELECTIONTYPING property.
  + Autocompletion lists send an SCN_AUTOCCOMPLETED notification
    after the text has been inserted.
  + The case mode style attribute can now be SC_CASE_CAMEL.
  + The Python lexer supports substyles for identifiers.
  + SciTE adds support for substyles.
  + SciTE's Export as RTF and Copy as RTF commands support UTF-8.
  + SciTE can display autocompletion on all IME input with
    ime.autocomplete property.
  + SciTE properties files now discard trailing white space on
    variable names.
  + Calling SCI_SETIDENTIFIERS resets styling to ensure any added
    identifier are highlighted.
  + Avoid candidate box randomly popping up away from edit pane
    with (especially Japanese) IME input.
  + Fix drawing problem when control characters are in a hidden
    style as they then have a zero width rectangle to draw but
    modify that rectangle in a way that clears some pixels.
  + Report error when attempt to resize buffer to more than 2GB
    with SC_STATUS_FAILURE.
  + Fix bug on GTK+ with scroll bars leaking (sf#1742).
  + LexOthers.cxx file split into one file per lexer: LexBatch,
    LexDiff, LexErrorList, LexMake, LexNull, and LexProps.
  + SciTE exporters handle styles > 127 correctly now.
  + SciTE implements find.in.files.close.on.find on all platforms.
- Add optflags to build to remove warning in rpmlint.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 20 23:34:04 UTC 2015 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.5.7:
  + Added SCI_MULTIPLESELECTADDNEXT to add the next occurrence of
    the main selection within the target to the set of selections
    as main. If the current selection is empty then select word
    around caret. SCI_MULTIPLESELECTADDEACH adds each occurrence of
    the main selection within the target to the set of selections.
  + SciTE adds "Selection Add Next" and "Selection Add Each"
    commands to the Search menu.
  + Added SCI_ISRANGEWORD to determine if the parameters are at the
    start and end of a word.
  + Added SCI_TARGETWHOLEDOCUMENT to set the target to the whole
    document.
  + Verilog lexer recognises protected regions and the folder folds
    protected regions.
  + A performance problem with markers when deleting many lines was
    fixed (sf#1733).
  + On GTK+ 3.4+, when there are both horizontal and vertical
    scrollbars, draw the lower-right corner so that it does not
    appear black when text selected (sf#1611).
  + Fixed most calls deprecated in GTK+ 3.16. Does not fix style
    override calls as they are more complex.
  + SciTE on GTK+ 3.x uses a different technique for highlighting
    the search strip when there is no match which is more
    compatible with future and past versions and different themes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 31 02:08:08 UTC 2015 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.5.6:
  + On Qt, use fractional positioning calls and avoid rounding to
    ensure consistency.
  + SCI_TARGETASUTF8 and SCI_ENCODEDFROMUTF8 implemented on GTK+
  + C++ lexer fixes empty backquoted string (sf#1711).
  + C++ lexer fixes #undef directive (sf#1719).
  + Fortran folder fixes handling of "selecttype" and "selectcase"
    (sf#1724).

  + The wxWidgets-specific ascent member of Font has been removed
    which breaks compatibility with current wxStyledTextCtrl
    (sf#1682).
  + IME on Qt supports multiple carets and behaves more like other
    platforms.
  + Always use inline IME on GTK+ for Korean.
  + SQL lexer fixes handling of '+' and '-' in numbers so the '-'
    in '1-1' is seen as an operator and for '1--comment' the
    comment is recognized.
  + TCL lexer reverts change to string handling (sf#1642).
  + Verilog lexer fixes bugs with macro styling. Verilog folder
    fixes bugs with `end completing an `if* instead of `endif and
    fold.at.else, and implements folding at preprocessor `else.
  + VHDL lexer supports extended identifiers.
  + Fix SciTE bug with missing file open filters and add hex to
    excluded set of properties files so that its settings don't

  + Adds minor features.
  + Bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  5 02:01:09 UTC 2014 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 3.4.4:
  + Style byte indicators removed. They were deprecated in 2007.
    Standard indicators should be used instead. Some elements used
    by lexers no longer take number of bits or mask arguments so
    lexers may need to be updated for LexAccessor::StartAt,
    LexAccessor::SetFlags (removed), LexerModule::LexerModule.
  + When multiple selections are active, autocompletion text may be
    inserted at each selection with new SCI_AUTOCSETMULTI method.
  + C++ lexer fixes crash for "#define x(" (sf#1614).
  + C++ lexer fixes raw string recognition so that R"xxx(blah)xxx"
    is styled as SCE_C_STRINGRAW.
  + The Postscript lexer no longer marks token edges with
    indicators as this used style byte indicators.
  + The Scriptol lexer no longer displays indicators for poor
    indentation as this used style byte indicators.
  + TCL lexer fixes names of keyword sets (sf#1615).
  + Shell lexer fixes fold matching problem caused by "<<<"
    (sf#1605).
  + Fix bug where indicators were not removed when fold
    highlighting on (sf#1604).
  + Fix crash on GTK+ with Ubuntu 12.04 and overlay scroll bars.
  + Avoid creating a Cairo context when measuring text on GTK+ as
    future versions of GTK+ may prohibit calling gdk_cairo_create
    except inside drawing handlers. This prohibition may be
    required on Wayland.
  + Fix crash in SciTE when stream comment performed at line end
    (sf#1610).
  + For SciTE on GTK+ fix bug with initialisation of toggle buttons
    in find and replace strips (sf#1612).

    SYMBOL is understood. Some macros with arguments can be
    understood and these may be predefined in keyword set 4
    (keywords5 for SciTE) with syntax similar to
    CHECKVERSION(x)=(x<3), Feature #1051.
  + C++ lexer can highlight task marker keywords in comments as
    SCE_C_TASKMARKER.
  + C++ lexer can optionally highlight escape sequences in strings
    as SCE_C_ESCAPESEQUENCE.
  + C++ lexer supports Go back quoted raw string literals with
    lexer.cpp.backquoted.strings option, Feature #1047.
  + SciTE performs word and search match highlighting as an idle
    task to improve interactivity and allow use of these features
    on large files.
  + Bug fixed where caret remained invisible when period set to 0
    (sf#1592).
  + Fixed display flashing when scrolling with GTK+ 3.10 (sf#1567).
  + Fixed calls and constants deprecated in GTK+ 3.10.
  + For SciTE, protect access to variables used by threads with a
    mutex to prevent data races.
  + For SciTE on GTK+ fix thread object leaks. Display the version
    of GTK+ compiled against in the about box.
  + For SciTE on GTK+ 3.10, fix the size of the tab bar's content
    and use freedesktop.org standard icon names where possible.
  + SciTE's highlight current word feature no longer matches the
    selection when it contains space.
- Changes from version 3.4.1:
  + Display Unicode line ends as [LS], [PS], and [NEL] blobs.
  + Bug fixed where cursor down failed on wrapped lines (sf#1585).
  + Caret positioning changed a little to appear inside characters

    provisional features.
  + Added wrap mode SC_WRAP_WHITESPACE which only wraps on
    whitespace, not on style changes.
  + SciTE find and replace strips can perform incremental searching
    and temporary highlighting of all matches with the
    find.strip.incremental, replace.strip.incremental, and
    find.indicator.incremental settings.

    assembly code which uses '#' for comments and ';' to separate
    statements.
  + Fix crashes and other bugs in Fortran folder by removing
    folding of do-label constructs.
  + Deleting a whole line deletes the annotations on that line
    instead of the annotations on the next line (sf#1577).
  + Changed position of tall calltips to prefer lower half of
    screen to cut off end instead of start.
  + Fix Qt bug where double click treated as triple click
    (sf#1575).
  + On Qt, selecting an item in an autocompletion list that is not
    currently visible positions it at the top.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    caret is at left or right of view to ensure caret is inside
    visible area.
  + Send SCN_UPDATEUI with SC_UPDATE_SELECTION for Shift+Tab inside
    text.
  + SciTE uses a bookmark ribbon symbol for bookmarks as it scales
    better to higher resolutions than the previous blue gem bitmap.
  + SciTE will change the width of margins while running when the
    margin.width and fold.margin.width properties are changed.
  + SciTE displays a warning message when asked to open a
    directory (sf#1568).

  + On Qt, bug fixed with finding monitor rectangle which could
    lead to autocomplete showing at wrong location.
  + SciTE fix for multiple message boxes when failing to save a
    file with save.on.deactivate (sf#1540).
  + SciTE on GTK+ fixes SIGCHLD handling so that Lua scripts can
    determine the exit status of processes they start (sf#1557).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 03:41:58 UTC 2013 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org
