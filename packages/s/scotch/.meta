  <title>Programs and libraries for graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning</title>
  <description>Programs and libraries for graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning Its purpose is to apply graph theory, with a divide and conquer approach, to scientific computing problems such as graph and mesh partitioning, static mapping, and sparse matrix ordering, in application domains ranging from structural mechanics to operating systems or bio-chemistry.

The SCOTCH distribution is a set of programs and libraries which implement the static mapping and sparse matrix reordering algorithms developed within the SCOTCH project.</description>
