Sun Nov 15 15:36:44 UTC 2020 - Wolfgang Bauer <wbauer@tmo.at>

- Update to 1.5.6.1
  * Fix a spell checker crash

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 14:00:23 UTC 2020 - Wolfgang Bauer <wbauer@tmo.at>

- Update to 1.5.6
  * User Interface:
    + One of the most important changes compared to earlier
      versions is the introduction of a context-sensitive Content
      Palette. If set to visible, it will adjust to the kind of
      item (text frame, image frame, table, group) you have
      selected.
    + Ctrl/Cmd+Click enables selecting items below guides.
    + A new PDF-based output preview is now available.
    + Support for dark UI themes has been improved.
    + Icon set can now be changed without needing to restart
      application
    + It's now possible to "cycle" through the items in a group by
      pressing Alt+Ctrl/Cmd+Click
  * Import/Export:
    + Support for PDF 1.6 export, including embedded OpenType
      fonts.
    + A Markdown import filter has been added.
    + Improvements to the IDML, PDF, XTG, SVG and KRA importers.
  * Text and Typography:
    + Launching Scribus via the Command Line on any OS will now
      reveal more font-related problems; based on fontconfig 3.14.
  * Colors:
    + Default black and white colors can now alternatively be
      defined in RGB and LAB.
  * Printing:
    + With the exception of the Windows platform, Scribus can now
      use a PDF-based and newly written printing engine. PostScript
      is still available, but will be removed over time.
  * Scripter:
    + On platforms other than macOS, Scribus now uses Python 3 by
      default. As a consequence, existing scripts will likely need
      to be modified so that they run in Scribus 1.5.6.
    + Many new commands have been added to the Scripter; others
      have been renamed to be more intuitive. For more information,
      please have a look at the Scripter documentation, which has
      also been updated to reflect the changes.
