This package contains pluggable CPU schedulers from the sched-ext project (https://github.com/sched-ext/scx) as well as development files to develop new custom schedulers in the scx-devel subpackage.

Me, Giovanni Gherdovich (ggherdovich) and Shung-Hsi Yu (shunghsiyu) would like to maintain this in Factory.

There is a wiki-page describing the provided schedulers and usage here: https://en.opensuse.org/Pluggable_CPU_schedulers

This version excludes the scx_loader service because of the dbus lints that failed the previous request and reworks the changelog to be more in line with the openSUSE guidelines.

Looking forward to any feedback!</comment>
