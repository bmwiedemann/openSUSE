-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 17 20:44:27 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add ssdeep-dynamic.patch: Link ssdeep dynamically to libfuzzy.
  As a side-effect, we can actually now also use configure
  --disable-static.
- Add libtool BuildRequires and call autoreconf, as above patch
  touches the build system.
