%description
An unofficial Spotify client using Qt as a simpler, lighter alternative to the official client, inspired by spotify-tui. Much like spotify-tui, you need an actual Spotify client running, for example spotifyd, which can be configured from within the app. Also like other clients, controlling music playback requires Spotify Premium.
