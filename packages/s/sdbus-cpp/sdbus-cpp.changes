- Update to version 2.1.0:
  * Add SDBUSCPP_REGISTER_STRUCT macro to conveniently teach sdbus-c++ about user-defined structs
  * Extend the SDBUSCPP_REGISTER_STRUCT macro with serialization of user-defined structs as dicts, and deserialization of dicts into user-defined structs
  * Make createPlainMessage() function public
  * Solve the problem of sending large D-Bus messages properly (through the event loop thread)
  * Fix partially renamed BUILD_DOXYGEN_DOC CMake option
  * Change googletest to default version 1.14.0
  * Add version parameter to the xml2cpp codegen tool
  * A few other internal refactorings and improvements
- Changes since version 2.0.0:
  * A new major version with revamped API, bringing numerous new features, simplifications, fixes and breaking changes improving not only API consistency, safety and expressiveness, but also performance
  * Add section 'Migrating to sdbus-c++ v2' to the 'Using sdbus-c++' document providing the complete list of breaking API/ABI/behavior changes and migration notes
  * Switch to C++20 standard (but the API is backwards-compatible with C++17, skipping C++20 features in such a case)
  * Add strong types to public API
  * Add support for string_view as a D-Bus type representation
  * Enable compile-time D-Bus signature generation
  * Redesign Object vtable registration API
  * Improve Proxy signal subscription API
  * Refactor object manager API for consistency
  * Introduce native sd-event integration
  * Let callbacks take message objects by value
  * Simplify async D-Bus connection handling
  * Simplify async call state flag
  * Make Variant constructor explicit
  * Use optional for passing potential call errors
  * Rename and re-organize CMake options
  * Rename connection creation methods
  * Have all async function names finish with *Async for consistency
  * Implement more flexible searching for sd-bus libs
  * Add new `SDBUSCPP_SDBUS_LIB` CMake configuration variable determining which sd-bus library shall be picked
  * Make Variant conversion operator explicit
  * Use sd-bus API to get the current message
  * Use sd_bus_match_signal() for signal registration
  * Provide also const char* overloads for convenience functions
  * Disable move in generated adaptor and proxy classes
  * Improve and make more efficient some Message API
  * Add Slot-returning overloads of async method calls
  * Remove floating_slot_t tag and use return_slot_t instead
  * Add [[nodiscard]] to many relevant API functions
  * Add proper fix for timeout handling
  * Fix for external event loops in which the event loop thread ID was not correctly initialized (now fixed and simplified by not needing the thread ID anymore)
  * Remove deprecated stuff
  * Add `SDBUSCPP_` prefix to CMake configuration variables to avoid conflicts with downstream projects
  * Require systemd of at least v238
  * Many other fixes and updates in code, tests, build system, CI, and documentation
