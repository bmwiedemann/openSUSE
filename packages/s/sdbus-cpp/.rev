I would like to request the inclusion of the sdbus-cpp library in SUSE distros. It's a C++ high-level API abstraction on top of the sd-bus library from libsystemd.

It is already available in Fedora 32/32/34:

https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sdbus-cpp

Debian 10 (backports) and 11:

https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sdbus-cpp

Ubuntu 21.04:

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sdbus-cpp

(a backport for Ubuntu 20.04 has also been requested)

The spec file was imported from Fedora and adapted for SUSE.</comment>
