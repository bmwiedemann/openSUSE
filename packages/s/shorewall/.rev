    <comment>-  removed ifupdown scripts from %post section and added to %files
  section

-  She-bang removal  according to upstream 

&quot;The prog.header* files become the first part of the compiled script, so
must contain '#!'.

It can be removed from the lib.* files. I have it there primarily to
cause Emacs to automatically choose shell mode when I edit the files.

Currently, the function 'show_connection_filter()' (*/lib.cli), depends
on the '#!' in an scfilter.&quot;

Therefore removed the she-bang from:
    /usr/share/shorewall/lib.*
    /usr/share/shorewall6/lib.*
    /usr/share/shorewall-lite/lib.*
    /usr/share/shorewall6-lite/lib.*

- reworked rpmlintrc as shorewall-4.4.22.rpmlintrc



- Update to 4.4.22.3. Corrections in this release are below.
  * On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', harmless
    Perl diagnostics like the following could be issued:
        Use of uninitialized value $list in pattern match (m//) 
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1273,
        &lt;$currentfile&gt; line 14.
        Use of uninitialized value $list in split 
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1275,
        &lt;$currentfile&gt; line 14.
  * On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Mangle FORWARD Chain: Not Available', entries in the
    ecn file generated the following Perl Diagnostic:
        Use of uninitialized value in hash element 
    at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 1119.
	
  * Previously, if a provider interface was derived from an optional
    wildcard entry in /etc/shorewall/providers, then the interface
    was never considered to be usable.
    Example:
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces:
    #ZONE    INTERFACE   BROADCAST    OPTIONS
      net ppp+     -  optionsl
    /etc/shorewall/providers:net
    #PROVIDER  NUMBER  MARK  INTERFACE ...
     ISP1   1   1 ppp0 
  * When 'shorewall update' or 'shorewall6 update' results in no change
    to the .conf file, a message is issued, the .bak file is removed
    and the command terminates without error.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 4.4.23.3
  * When providers were present that specify neither 'balance' nor
    'fallback', then the following message was issued during
    compilation and 'enable' of the interface would fail.
    Use of uninitialized value $weight in concatenation (.) or
    string  at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Providers.pm line 644.
  * TC_ENABLED=Shared was broken in Shorewall 4.4.23, 4.4.23.1 and
    4.4.23.2. It produced a  shell script with syntax errors.

  * A'refresh' command with no chains or tables specified will
    now reload chains created by entries in the BLACKLIST section of
    the rules file.
  * The rules compiler previously failed to detect the 'Flow
    Filter' capability. That capability is now correctly detected.
  * The IN_BANDWIDTH handling changes in 4.4.25 was incompatible
    with moribund distributions such as RHEL4. Restoring IN_BANDWIDTH
    functionality on those releases required a new 'Basic Filter'
    capability.
 

- Update to 4.4.25 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
 * A defect in the optimizer that allowed incompatible rules to be
   combined has been corrected.
 * Routes and rules added as a result of entries in
   /etc/shorewall6/providers were previously not deleted by 
   'stop' or 'restart'. Repeated 'restart' commands could
   therefore  lead to an incorrect routing configuration.
 * Previously, capital letters were disallowed in IPv6 addresses.
   They are now permitted.
 * If the COPY column in /etc/shorewall6/providers was non-empty,
   previously a run-time error could occur when copying a table.
   The diagnostic produced by ip was:
       Either &quot;to&quot; is duplicate, or &quot;cache&quot; is garbage
 * When copying IPv6 routes, the generated script previously
   attempted to copy 'cache' entries. Those entries are now omitted.

   * Previously, if all the following were true:
    - AUTOMAKE=Yes
    - Current compiled script (/var/lib/shorewall/firewall or
      /var/lib/shorewall6/firewall) up to date
    - LEGACY_FASTSTART=No
    - There was a saved configuration
    then rather than start the current configuration, 'shorewall 
    start -f' or 'shorewall6 start -f' would incorrectly restore
    the saved  configuration.
    * The DropSmurfs and TCPFlags actions are now available in
    Shorewall6. They were previously omitted from the IPv6 
    actions.std file.
    * The 'rawpost' table was previously omitted from the output of 
    the 'dump' command. It is now displayed.
    * Previously, if a configuration contained more than one wildcard
    interface (physical name ending in '+'), then the generated script
    might not work properly with Shorewall-init. This defect dates back
    to the introduction of Shorewall-init.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 4.4.26 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release includes all corrections included in 4.4.25.1
    through .3.
  * In 4.4.25, ACCEPT behaved in the BLACKLIST section the same way
    as in the other rules file sections. This could lead to
    connections  being accepted inadvertently.
    Now, ACCEPT behaves like WHITELIST; that is, it exempts the
    packet from the remaining rules in the BLACKLIST section.
  * Previously, Shorewall did not detect the ULOG and NFLOG
    capabilities. This lead to run-time failures during 'start' and
    'restart' as well as confusing error messages during
    compilation  when ULOG or NFLOG was used when the LOG target was
    not available.
    ULOG and NFLOG are now detected capabilities so, if you use a
    capabilities file, you will need to regenerate it in order to
    use these log levels.
  * The SAME tcrules target was broken in Shorewall 4.4.22. It now
    works correctly again.
  * Previously, 'shorewall6 update' did not update shorewall6.conf.
    The command now works as expected.
  * In earlier releases, the compiler was attempting to process the
    params file before it was aware of the setting of CONFIG_PATH.
    This could cause the params file to be missed if it was not located
    in /etc/shorewall[6] or in the directory named in the start
    (restart,compile,check,...) command.
    Now, /sbin/shorewall[6] passes $CONFIG_PATH to the compiler
    (/usr/share/shorewall/compiler.pl) in the new '--config_path'
    option.</comment>

 * The 4.4.26 rules compiler does not issue a warning when a
   capabilities file was generated with Shorewall 4.4.25, even
   though new capabilities were added in 4.4.26. This has been
   corrected so that a warning is generated.
 * When TC_ENABLED=Shared, CLASSIFY rules could not be used in the
   tcrules file. Thanks to a patch from Chris Boot, this now works
   as expected.
 * The quoted part of the progress message 'Provider &quot;...&quot;
   compiled' was inadvertently omitted by a change in Shorewall 4.4.23.

    <comment>- Update to 4.4.27.2. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * A long-standing problem with Shorewall's 'save' facility has
    been discovered. The defect can cause rules to be dropped during
    'save' so that they are not available to be reapplied during
    'restore'. This can occur in 'safe-restart' when the prompt is
    not acknowledged or when it is acknowledged with 'n'.
    The problem can occur when:
    a)	There are IPSEC zones or hosts present; and
    b)  GOTO Target support is available in the kernel and
        iptables.
    Example of rule that will be dropped:
      -A eth2_fwd -m policy --dir in --pol ipsec -g AAA_frwd
    The defective code has been corrected so that rules are no
    longer dropped.
 

- Update to 4.4.27.1. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt 
  * When optimization category 4 is used, unconditional jumps at
    the end of chains are replaced with the rules in the target
    chain. This can result in rulesets that are considerably larger
    than necessary. Beginning with this release, replacement will
    only occur if:
    a) The jump is the only reference to the target chain; or
    b) The target chain contains 3 or less rules.
  * The feature introduced in 4.4.25 that allowed provider names in
    the  'enable' and 'disable' commands was only implemented for
    'enable'. It is now implemented for 'disable' as well.
  * When detecting IPv6 global addresses through an interface,</comment>

    table was generated. This has been corrected so that
    USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes always results in such a rule at
     priority 999.

- Update to 4.5.1.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When checking or compiling for export (-e option),
    /sbin/shorewall would previously issue a warning message if
    the SHOREWALL_SHELL specified in the remote
    firewall's shorewall.conf did not exist.
  * The changes to TOS handling in 4.5.1 are incompatible with
    older releases such as RHEL5 and derivatives. That has been
    corrected.
  * The rules compiler now verifies that the protocol is TCP, UDP,
    SCTP or DCCP when checking a port range (low:high or low-high).
  * Previously, start or restart using the init script would fail
    with an error message referencing 'SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT'.
    This defect was not visible to users that set AUTOMAKE=Yes or 
    that run Shorewall-init. 

- Update to 4.5.1 For more details see changelog.txt and

  * This release includes all defect repair from versions
    4.5.0.1-4.5.0.3.
  * A typo has been corrected in the blrules man pages.
  * Previously, if the interface appearing in the HOSTS column of
    /etc/shorewall6/hosts was not defined in

  * If a shorewallrc file is passed to the 4.5.2.1 Shorewall-core 	
    install.sh, subsequent compilations fail. The error message
    indicates that the compiler is looking for lib.core, but the
    pathname has embedded spaces.

   cases. In particular:

   	 ?IF $FALSE
              foo
             bar
         ?ENDIF

    In this case, the lines 'baz' and 'bodyp' were incorrectly
    included when they should have beeen omitted.
  * The 'balance' routing table is now cleared if there are no
    'balance' providers.
  * Previously, the compiler generated an invalid 'ip add route'
    command if an IPv6 provider had '-' in the GATEWAY column.
  * As noted in the Migration Considerations, the generated
    firewall script maintains the interface .status files used by
    LSM and SWPING. Up to now, however, the 'disable' command did
    not update the .status file. That has been corrected. As part
    of the change, the 'isusable' script is no longer consulted by
    the'enable' command.

    <comment>- Update to 4.5.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When EXPORTMODULES=No in shorewall.conf, the error messages
    have been eliminated
  * If the configuration settings in the PACKET MARK LAYOUT section
    of shorewall.conf (shorewall6.conf) had empty settings, the
    'update' command would previously set them to their default
    settings. It now  leaves them empty.
  * Previously, Shorewall used 'unreachable' routes to null-route
    the RFC1918 subnets. This approach has two drawbacks:
     - It can cause problems for IPSEC in that it can cause packets
       to be rejected rather than encrypted and forwarded.
     - It can return 'host unreachable' ICMPs to other systems that
       attempt to route RFC1918 addresses through the firewall.
     To eliminate these problems, Shorewall now uses 'blackhole'
     routes. 
     Such routes don't interfere with IPSEC and silently drop
     packets  rather than return an ICMP.
  * The 'default' routing table is now cleared if there are no
     'fallback' providers. 
  * Tproxy implementation has been reworked. For more details

  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.22, the 'pptpserver' tunnel type
    has been configured as a PPTP client running on the firewall
    rather than as a server on the firewall. It is now correctly
    configured as  a server.
  * The shorewall-accounting (5) and shorewall6-accounting (5)
    documentation for the IPSEC column is incorrect. Rather than
    'accountin' and 'accountout', the chain names should be
    'accipsecin' and 'accipsecout'.
  *  IPSEC accounting did not work if the accounting file was
     sectioned. Beginning with this release, the IPSEC column can
     be specified in any section. As always, the IPSEC column
     contains a comma-separated  list of items. In the FORWARD
     chain, the first (or only) item in the list must be either
     'in' or 'out' to indicate whether the rule  matches incoming
     packets that have been decrypted ('in') or outgoing packets
     that will be encrypted ('out'). There are no restrictions with
     respect to which chain IPSEC rules can appear in  a sectioned
     file.</comment>

  releasnotes.txt
  * This release includes all defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.4.1
     and 4.5.4.2.
  * The Shorewall compiler sometimes must defer generating a rule
    until runtime. This is done by placing shell commands in its
    internal representation of a chain. These commands are then
    executed at run time to create the final rule.
    If all of the following were true, then an incorrect ruleset
    could be generated:
    + Optimization level 4 was set.
    + A chain (chain A) containing shell commands had three or
      fewer rules and commands.
    + The last rule in a second chain was a conditional jump to
     chain A.
     Under these conditions, the rules and commands in Chain A
  * The Shorewall-core configure and configure.pl script were
    treating SYSCONFDIR as a synonym for CONFDIR making it
    impossible to set SYSCONFDIR. 

- Update to 4.5.4.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * The problems corrected section of the 4.5.4.1 release notes was
    missing the third problem corrected in the release. It has now
    been added.
  * A number of problems in Shorewall-init have been corrected:
     + If more than one product was listed in the PRODUCTS setting
       in /etc/default/shorewall-init (/etc/sysconfig/shorewall-init)
       then the second product would not be started/stopped.
     + Shorewall-init used 'restart' in response to an optional</comment>

  * The compiler now generates an error when a SOURCE interface is
    specified in a rule where the SOURCE zone is the firewall
    itself.
  * Previously, entries in /etc/shorewall/notrack that specified a
    Vserver zone in the SOURCE column were omitted from the
    generated  ruleset.
  * The set of helpers available in the notrack file and in the
    HELPER column of the tcrules file was incorrect:
     - The Amanda helper requires a UDP port -- Shorewall was
       requiring
       TCP.
     - The H323 module supplies two helpers: 'RAW' and 'Q.931';
       Shorewall only accepted 'h323'.
     - The Netbios NS module supplies the 'netbios-ns' helper;
       Shorewall
       only accepted 'netbios_ns'.
  * The conditional directive '?IF 0' generated an error from the
    compiler. It now causes following lines to be omitted. (forwarded request 130454 from toganm)</comment>

  * This release includes the defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.6.2.
  * The command 'shorewall enable pppX' could fail with the ip
    diagnostic Error: either &quot;to&quot; is duplicate, or &quot;weight&quot; is a
    garbage.
     Shorewall now generates the correct ip command.
  * Optimize level 4 could previously combine two rules that each
    specified the 'policy' match, leading to this iptables-restore
    failure:
        policy match: multiple elements but no --strict
     The optimizer now avoids combining such rules.
     While this is a long-standing defect in the optimizer, it was
     exposed by changes in Shorewall 4.5.6.
   * There were several cases where hard-wired directory names
     appeared in the tarball installers. These have been replaced
     with the appropriate shorewallrc variables.
   * A defect in RHEL 6.3 and derivatives causes 'shorewall show
     capabilities' to leave an empty ipset in the configuration. The
     same defect can cause the Shorewall compiler to similarly leave
     an empty ipset behind.
     This Shorewall release has a workaround for this problem.

  * When using IPSEC in a multi-ISP configuration, it is possible
    for the kernel to mis-route ESP packets. To date, this problem
    has only been observed on a system running a 3.5 kernel where
    traffic is being tunneled through GRE which is in turn being
    tunneled via IPSEC.
    This Shorewall release includes a low-cost workaround.
  * The Netfilter team have announced their intention to remove the
    NOTRACK target in favor of 'CT --notrack'. Shorewall will now
    map  NOTRACK to 'CT --notrack' if the CT Target is available.
  * Previously, the current COMMENT was not being cleared after the
    blrules file was processed, causing that COMMENT to be used on
    entries in the rules file. That defect has been corrected.

    <comment>- Update to 4.5.8.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When ipset version 5 or later was installed, the 'shorewall show
    dynamic &amp;lt;zone&amp;gt;' command produced no outout and the 'add' command
    failed with this error message:
        Zone &amp;lt;zone&amp;gt;, interface &amp;lt;interface&amp;gt; does not have a dynamic
        host list&quot;
  * When generating ipset names for dynamic zones, the compiler was
    dropping dashes ('-') from the interface name and adding a unique
    suffix. For example the ipset for zone 'foo' and interface 'bar-if'
    might be 'foo_barif_1'. Dashes are now retained so that the
    generated set name in this example will be 'foo_bar-if'. This change
    also allows the 'add' and 'delete' commands to work correctly when
    the interface name contains one or more dashes.
    Although dash is documented as being an accepted character in ipset
    names, names containing a dash would generate an error in some
    contexts. That has also been corrected.
  * In most contexts, Shorewall6 has required IPv6 addresses to be
    enclosed in either angled brackets ( &amp;lt;....&amp;gt; , deprecated) or in
    square brackets ([....]). This includes network addresses, where
    both the IPv6 address and the VLSM are required to be within the
    brackets (e.g., [2001;470:b:787::/64]). This differs from the
    industry-standard network form in which the IPv6 address is enclosed
    in square brackets and the VLSM is outside of the brackets (e.g.,
    [2001:470:b:787::]/64). Beginning with this release, the
    industry-standard representation is also accepted by Shorewall6.
    Note: Those of you who read the patches will probably have noticed
    that much of this change was actually in 4.5.8; because the change
    was commited late in the 4.5.8 release cycle, we chose not to
    document the change until it had undergone additional testing. (forwarded request 137407 from toganm)</comment>

  * The 'shorewall show' command previously produced no output.
    That command now works with ipset versions 4 and later.
  * The change in 4.5.8.1 that enabled industry-standard IPv4
    address representation broke the ability to place IP ranges or
    IPv6 ipsets in the hosts file. Those abilities have been
    restored.
  * The treatment of the SYSTEMD and INITFILE shorewallrc variables
    has been inconsistent. The -lite installers ignore INITFILE
    when SYSTEMD is specified, while the other installers do not.
    Now, the -lite installers install the .service file if SYSTEMD
    is specified and they install the sysv-init script if INITFILE
    is specified. That is consistent with the behavior of the other
    installers.

    <comment>- Update to 4.5.9 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release contains all defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.8.2.
  * A typo has been corrected in the shorewallrc.default file.
  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.7.2, Shorewall unconditionally
    restores the provider mark as the first rule in the mangle
    table OUTPUT and PREROUTING chains. Previously, the provider
    mark was restored only if it was non-zero.
    It has become clear that some users need it one way while
    others need it the other way. To resolve this issue, a
    RESTORE_ROUTEMARKS option has been added to shorewall.conf and
    shorewall6.conf. When this option is set to Yes (the default),
    the 4.5.7.2 approach is used (always restore the mark, even if
    it is zero); when it is set to No, the pre-4.5.7.2 behavior is
    retained (only restore the mark if it is non-zero).
  * Two error messages produced by the RST action have been
    corrected. They previously referred to errors in the NotSyn
    action rather than RST. (forwarded request 139762 from toganm)</comment>

 * Previously, the rules in the 'routemark' chain did not specify
   a mask in the MARK target. While a mask isn't strictly necessary
   in those rules, one has been added to ally fears of those who read
   the  generated ruleset.
    Note: The 'routemark' chain is used to apply provider marks to
    packets received from 'track' provider interfaces. It is
    traversed  early in the mangle PREROUTING chain when no other
    marks have yet been applied to the packet.
 * If exclusion was used with TPROXY in the tcrules file, an
   invalid  iptables ruleset was generated causing start and
   restart commands  to fail when running iptables-restore.
 * Previously, if a provider and its interface had the same name,
   then the 'enable' command would not work on that interface. (forwarded request 142299 from toganm)</comment>

  * This release includes all defect repair included in
    4.5.9.1-4.5.9.3.
  * Under rare circumstances, optimize level 16 could produce
    invalid iptables-restore input which would cause start/restart
    to fail.
  * Before this release, the 'started' script was run prior to
    copying the temporary script file (e.g., /var/lib/shorewall/.start)
    to /var/dir/shorewall/firewall. If the script failed, the copy
    would not take place even though the firewall had started
    successfully. The script is now copied before running the
    'started' script.
    If you compare the script generated by this release with one
    generated by a prior release, We suggest that you ignore
    whitespace changes (e.g., use the '-w' option in diff); that way,
    you can see the actual change more clearly.
  * AUTOCOMMENT=No now works correctly; previously, it behaved the
    same as AUTOCOMMENT=Yes.
  * A harmless extraneous comma has been deleted from the rule
    generated by action.RST. (forwarded request 144821 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>No package depends on Shorewall, making it a leaf package so the version upgrade does not affect other packages.

There is also a fix for bnc#798525 which corrects the messed systemd service files

This version also corrects fixes some other bugs related to the xtable-addon modules.

   * The following warning message may be emitted inappropriately
     when running shorewall 4.5.17. The message is no longer issued.
      The rule(s) generated by  this entry are unreachable and have
      been discarded
    * Rules intended to increment nfacct objects would previously be
      optimized away when they immediately preceded an unconditional
      jump to the same target. Such rules are now retained.
    * A bug in the optimizer in 4.5.17 can cause 'set' and 'geoip'
      matches to be dropped. That has been corrected.

  * ip[6]tables 1.4.20 introduced an incompatible change that
    causes the program to fail if there is another instance of either
    iptables or ip6tables already running. This behavior can be avoided
    if the new -w option is specified.
    To work around this problem, the compiler now uses the -w
    option (when available) during capabilities determination so that
    shorewall and shorewall6 compilations can proceed in parallel.
  * Previously, the Shorewall-init installer unconditionally
    installed the sysconfig file even when a different SYSCONFFILE was
    specified. (Thomas D).
  * /sbin/shorewall-init now includes the correct SYSCONFDIR name
    in its error message that reports the absense of
     ${SYSCONFDIR}/shorewall-init. (Thomas D).
  * /sbin/shorewall-init and the Shorewall-init SysV init scripts
    now honor the setting of $OPTIONS.
  * The -lite installers now look in ${SHAREDIR} for the
    coreversion file rather than in /usr/share/.
  * If a Shorewall-lite installation used an 
    /etc/shorewall-lite/vardir file to set a non-standard state
    directory, the administrative system would send the firewall
    and firewall.conf files to the wrong directory on the firewall
    system.
  * Previously, the compiler verified 'monthdays' specifications in
    the rules TIME column, but failed to include --monthdays in the
    generated rule. That omission has been corrected.
  * The Multicast DNS macros (mDNS and mDNSbi) now allow the entire
    non-priv port range (1024-65535) for the the dynamic unicast
    port. Previously, only the Linux 2.6+ dynamic port range (forwarded request 202077 from toganm)</comment>

  * Previously, the AutoBL action would fail if the kernel and
    iptables did not support the Recent Match '--reap' option. A new
    REAP_OPTION  capability has been added to work around this issue.
  * The Shorewall-core installer no longer reports an error from
    'cp' stating that it could not stat the shorewallrc file.
  * When a non-root user attempts to execute 'version -a', the CLI
    no longer attempts to get the version of the compiled
    firewall. Previously, the command issued the following
    diagnostic when run by non-root:
     /sbin/shorewall: /var/lib/shorewallhorewall/firewall:
     Permission denied
  * Shorewall no longer uses 'fgrep' thus allowing for use on
    systems without that utility. All uses of 'fgrep' have been
    replaced by 'grep -F'.
  * Placing |&amp;lt;mark&amp;gt; in the ACTION column of the tcrules file no

  * The Broadcast actions have been corrected:
    - --dst-type BROADCAST has been removed from the IPv6 version
    - A superfluous DROP rule in the IPv4 version has been
      suppressed.
  * Previously, if an HFSC class was specified with dmax but not
     umax, then the firewall would fail to start with the messages:

  * When a non-terminating target specified logging, the compiler
    would erroneously generate a 'goto' (-g) iptables command rather
    than a 'jump' (-j) command. This caused the wrong set of rules
    to be traversed, usually the catchall 'REJECT' or 'DROP' rule
    at theend of the INPUT or FORWARD chain.
    The compiler now generates a 'jump' rule in these cases.
   * When an interface containing a period (such as a VLAN
     interfaceterface) was used in an 'add' or 'delete' command,
     the wrong ipset name was generated, resulting in failure of
     the command. (forwarded request 220673 from toganm)</comment>

  * The help text for the 'dump' command has been updated to
    include all valid options.
  * The behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is corrected.
    Previously, 'shorewall stop' would not block existing connections
    regardless of the setting of this option. Beginning with this
    release, the behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No depends on whether
    the  routestopped or the stoppedrules file defines the allow
    connections while the firewall is stopped.
    If there are entries in /etc/shorewall[6]/routestopped or if
    there are no entries in /etc/shorewall[6]/stoppedrules, then the
    behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is as documented (existing
    connections are blocked unles they are allowed by
    /etc/shorewall[6]/routestopped).  If there are no entries in
    /etc/shorewall[6]/stoppedrules, then the behavior is as if
    ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes and a warning message is generated.

  * The output of 'shorewall show capabilities' always showed the

    show -fcapabilities' correctly reported the capability.
  * When a rules file section other than NEW began with a ?COMMENT
    directive, the comment would erroneously appear in the rule
    which jumps to the section chain as well as in the rules directly
    related to the following entries.
  * Rule comments were omitted from the compiler's 'trace' output
    in some cases.
  * When FASTACCEPT=Yes, ESTABLISHED,RELATED accept rules were
    incorrectly omitted from an interfaces's _in and _fwd chains
    when 'rpfilter' was specified in the interfaces's entry in

  * The 'upgrade -A' command now converts the tcrules file to a
    mangle file. Previously, that didn't happen.
  * The install components now support RHEL7.
  * Whitespace issues in the skeleton configuration files have been
    corrected (Tuomo Soini).
  * FAQ 2e has been added which describes additional steps required
    to achieve hairpin NAT on a bridge where the modified packets are
    to go out the same bridge port as they entered.
  * shorewall-masq(5) has been corrected to include the word SOURCE
    on the description of that column. Previously, the description
    read '(formerly called SUBNET)'.
  * The output of 'shorewall show filters' once again shows ingress
    (policing) filters. This works around undocumented changes to
    the behavior of the 'tc' utility.

  * An improved error message is generatred when a server address
    list is specified in the DEST colume of a DNAT or REDIRECT
    rule. At one time, iptables supported such lists, but now only
    a single address or an address range is supported.
    The previous error message was:
    ERROR: Unkknown Host (192.168.1.4,192.168.1.22)
    The new error message is:
    ERROR: An address list (192.168.1.4,192.1688.1.22) is not
       allowed in the DEST column of a xxx RULE
    whenere xxx is DNAT or REDIRECT as appropriate.
  * Two problems have been corrected in the Shorewall-init Debian
    init script.
   + A cosmetic problem which releasenotessulted in 'echo_notdone'
     being displayed on failure rather than 'nott done'.
   + More seriously, the test for the existance of compiled
     firewall scripts was incorrect, with the result that the
     firewallingall scripts were not executed.
     These defects, introduced in Shorewall 4.5.17, have now been
     corrected.

    + SAVE and RESTORE generated fatal compilation errors.
    + '|' and '&amp;amp;' were ignored. That issue is also present in the
      processing of the mangle file
  * Version 4.6.2 changes
    + The DSCP match in the mangle and tcrules files didn't work
      with service class names such as EF, BE, CS1, ... 
    + The SAVE and RESTORE actions were disallowed in the OUTPUT
      chain in tcrules and mangle; this was a regression from 4.5.21.
    + Additional ports required by Asus, Supermicro and Dell have
      beenadded to the IPMI macro (Tuomo Soini).
    +  Some issues regarding install under Cygwin64 have been
       addressed.
      - configure.pl did not understand CYGWIN returned from `uname`
      - Shorewall-core install.sh did not understand CYGWIN returned

- Changes in 4.6.5.1
  * The generated script can now detect an gateway address assigned
    by later versions of that program (Alan Barrett).
  * In 4.6.5, the bash-based configure script would issue the
    following diagnostic if SERVICEDIR was not specified in the
    shorewallrc file:
      ./configure: line 199: [SERVICEDIR]=: command not found
    This was compounded by the fact that all of the released
    shorewallrc files still specified SYSTEMDDIR rather than
    SERVICEDIR (Evangelos Foutras)

    that option would not correctly update the Chains module which
    led to a Perl compilation failure.
  * Handling of ipset names in PORT columns has been corrected.

  * Previously the SAVE and RESTORE actions were erroneously disallowed
    in the INPUT chain within the mangle file.
  * The manpage descriptions of the mangle SAVE and RESTORE actions
    incorrectly required a slash (/) prior to the mask value.
  * Race conditions could previously occur between the 'start'
    command and the 'enable' and 'disable' commands.
  * The 'update' command incorrectly added the INLINE_MATCHES
    option to shorewall.conf with a default value of 'Yes'. This
    caused 'start' to fail with invalid iptables rules when the
    alternate input format using ';' is used.
  * Previously the LOCKFILE setting was not propagated to the
    generated script. So when the script was run directly, the script
    unconditionally used ${VARDIR}/lock. (forwarded request 282633 from toganm)</comment>

  * Previously, the SAME action in the mangle file had a fixed
    timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes). That action now allows
    specification of a different timeout.
  * It is now possible to add or delete addresses from an ipset
    with entries in the mangle file. The ADD and DEL actions have
    the same behavior in the mangle file as they do in the rules
    file.

  * This release includes defect repair from Shorewall 4.6.6.2 and
    earlier releases.
  * Previously, when the -n option was specified and NetworkManager
    was installed on the target system, the Shorewall-init installer
    would still create
    ${DESTDIR}etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01-shorewall, regardless
    of the setting of $CONFDIR. That has been corrected such that
    the directory
    ${DESTDIR}${CONFDIR}/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01-shorewall
    is created instead.
  * Previously, handling of the IPTABLES and IP6TABLES actions in
    the conntrack file was broken. nfw provided a fix on IRC.
  * The Shorewall-core and Shorewall6 installers would previously
    report incorrectly that the product release was not installed.

  * This release contains defect repair from Shorewall 4.6.8.1 and

  * The means for preventing loading of helper modules has been
    clarified in the documentation.
  * The SetEvent and ResetEvent actions previously set/reset the
    event even if the packet did not match the other specified
    columns. This has been corrected.
  * Previously, the 'show capabilities' command was ignoring the
    HELPERS setting. This resulted in unwanted modules being
    autoloaded  and, when the -f option was given, an incorrect
    capabilities file was generated.
  * Previously, when 'wait' was specified for an interface, the
    generated script erroneously checked for required interfaces on
    all commands rather than just start, restart and restore. (forwarded request 305794 from toganm)</comment>

  * Previously, when the -c option was given to the 'compile'
    command, the progress message &quot;Compiling...&quot; was issued before
    it was determined if compilation was necessary.  Now, that message
    is suppressed when re-compilation is not required.
  * Previously, when the -c option was given to the 'compile'
    command, the 'postcompile' extension script was executed even when
    there was no (re-)compilation. Now, the 'postcompile' script is
    only invoked  when a new script is generated.
  * If CONFDIR was other than /etc, then ordinary users would not 
    receive a clear error message when they attempted to execute
    one of the commands that change the firewall state.
  * Previously, IPv4 DHCP client broadcasts were blocked by the
    'rpfilter' interface option. That has been corrected.
  * The 'update' command incorrectly added the INLINE_MATCHES
    option to shorewall6.conf with a default value of 'Yes'. This
    caused 'start' to fail with invalid ip6tables rules when the alternate
    input format using ';' is used.
    Note: This last issue is not documented in the release notes

  * The 'rules' file manpages have been corrected regarding the
    packets that are processed by rules in the NEW section.
  * Parsing of IPv6 address ranges has been corrected. Previously,
    use of ranges resulted in 'Invalid IPv6 Address' errors.
  * The shorewall6-hosts man page has been corrected to show the
    proper contents of the HOST(S) column.
  * Previously, INLINE statements in the mangle file were not 
    recognized if a chain designator (:F, :P, etc.) followingowed 
    INLINE(...). As a consequence, additional matches following
    a semicolon were interpreted as column/value pairs unless
    INLINE_MATCHES=Yes, resulting in compilation failure.
  * Inline matches on IP[6]TABLE rules could be ignored if
    INLINE_MATCHES=No. They are now recognized.
  * Specifying an action with a logging level in one of the
    _DEFAULT options in shorewall[6].conf
    (e.g., REJECT_DEFAULT=Reject:info) produced a compilation error:
      ERROR: Invalid value (:info) for first Reject parameter
           /usr/share/shorewall/action.Rejectect (line 52)
    That has been corrected. Note, however, that specifying logging
    with a default action tends to defeat one of the main purposes
    of default actions which is to suppress logging.
  * Previously, it was necessary to set TC_EXPERT=Yes to have full
    access to the user mark in fw marks. That has been corrected so
    that any place that a mark or mask can be specified, both the
    TC mark and the User mark are accessible. (forwarded request 331029 from toganm)</comment>

    <comment>- Bugfix release 5.1.3.2
  Previously, if a Shorewall Variable (e.g., @chain) was the target
  of a conditional ?RESET directive (one that was enclosed in ?if.
  ?else...?endif logic), the compiler could incorrectly use an
  existing chain created from the action rather than creating a new
  (and different) chain. That has been corrected.
  Previously, if alternate input format specified a column that had
  already been specified, the contents of that column were silently
  overwritten. Now, a warning message is issued stating that the
  prior value has been replaced by the newer value. (forwarded request 482666 from bruno_friedmann)</comment>

    <comment>- Bugfix and enhancement release 5.1.4.2
  complete changelog is available
  http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/5.1/shorewall-5.1.4/releasenotes.txt
- Main changes
  All IPv6 standard actions have been deleted and their logic
  has been added to their IPv4 counterparts who can now handle
  both address families.
  Previously, ?error and ?require messages as well as verbose ?info
  and ?warning messages (those that report the file and line numbers)
  generated from an action file would report the action file name and
  line number rather than the file and line number where the action
  was invoked. The file and line number where the action was invoked
  were listed second. Beginning with this release, the invoking file
  and line number are listed first and the action file and line number
  are not reported. This allows for creation of clearer messages.
  
  IPv6 UPnP support (including MINIUPNPD) is now available.
  A PERL_HASH_SEED option has been added to allow the Perl hash seed
  to be specified.  See shorewall.conf(5) and perlsec(1) for details. (forwarded request 503677 from bruno_friedmann)</comment>

    <comment>- Changes in 5.1.12.3
  Problems Corrected:
  When 'reset' and 'dst' were specified to the IfEvent action,
  the action would incorrectly attempt to reset the event for the
  SOURCE IP address rather than the DEST address. That has been
  corrected. (forwarded request 596669 from bruno_friedmann)</comment>

    <comment>- Add perl-base as buildrequirement to force choice of SHA-DIGEST
  new problem in TW
- To fix boo#1166114 never restart shorewall-init.service
  macro service_del_postun is replaced by simplier systemd_postun
- Remove conflict between main and lite package.
  A managing station need main to build configuration and can use
  -lite to execute it. Users are in charge of choosing which
  service has to be started and used. ❤ Freedom
- Remove shorewall require from shorewall-init (was a forgoten
  action)
- Update to version 5.2.4
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.4/releasenotes.txt
  + Previously, when a Shorewall6 firewall was placed into the
    'stopped' state, ICMP6 packets required by RFC 4890 were not
    automatically accepted by the generated ruleset.
    Beginning with this release, those packets are automatically
    accepted.
  + Previously, the output of 'shorewall[6] help' displayed the
    superseded 'load' command. That text has been deleted.
  + The QOSExample.html file in the documentation and on the web site
    previously showed tcrules content for the /etc/shorewall/mangle
    file (recall that 'mangle' superseded 'tcrules'). That page has
    been corrected.
  + The 'Starting and Stopping' and 'Configuration file basics'
    documents have been updated to align them with the current product
    behavior.
  +  The 'ipsets' document has been updated to clarify the use of
    ipsets in the stoppedrules file.
- Packaging
  + shorewall-init package has a removed %service_del_postun
    macro to close bug boo#1166114 Restarting this service can
    lock down admin out of the system.
  + shorewall(6) and shorewall(6)-lite conflict has they shouldn't
    be installed together on the same system.
  + conf_update flag is set to 1 to activate update reminder
  + Adjust and cleanup requires
- Add version to requires in -lite version</comment>

  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.4/releasenotes.txt
  + Fixes for debian
- Update to version 5.2.4.1
  + Fixes for openSUSE shorewall-init
  will now ignore 'start' and 'stop' commands, for running firewalls
  + Spurious messages have been removed
- Packaging
  + Move /usr/sbin/shorewall to shorewall-core so -lite version
    doesn't need main shorewall package
  + To make shorewall remote-* command working we patch lib.cli-std
    to use /usr/sbin instead of /sbin + commented spec
  + Desactivate for the moment the upgrade warning. we need to
    find a 100% working solution.
  + use %{var} form everywhere</comment>

  + 'shorewall[6] start' would not automatically create dynamic
    blacklisting ipsets. That has been corrected.
