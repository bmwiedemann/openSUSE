- Update to version 5.2.8 (Upgrade your configuration)
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.8/releasenotes.txt
  + Certain restrictions that apply to wildcard interfaces (interface
    name ends in '+') were previously not enforced when the logical
    interface name did not end in '+' but the physical interface name
    did end in '+'.  That has been corrected.
  + To ensure that error messages appear in the correct place in the
    output stream, stderr is now redirected to stdout when the
    configured PAGER is used by a command.
  + Since Shorewall 5.1.0, the Shorewall uninstall.sh script has
    incorrectly removed ${SBINDIR}/shorewall, while the Shorewall-core
    uninstall.sh script has failed to remove that file. Both scripts
    have been corrected.
  + Previously, the Shorewall CLI included a spurious hyphen ('-')
    between the product name (e.g., 'Shorewall6') and the version when
    printing a command output banner.
  + The shorewall-snat(5) manpage previously stated that a
    comma-separated list of IP address could be specified for
    SNAT. That statement was in error and has been removed. As part of
    this change, IPv4 Example 6 has been updated to use the
    PROBABILITY column.
  - New features
    + 'show tc' command now shows the classifiers associated with
    each interface (as displayed by the 'show classifiers'
    command). This integrated qdisc/filter information is also included
    in the output of the 'dump' command. This change deprecates the
    'show classifiers' ('show filters') command, as that command's
    output is now included in the 'show tc' output.
    + Shorewall6 has traditionally generated rules for IPv6 anycast
    addresses. These rules include:
    a)  Packets with these destination IP addresses are dropped by
    	REJECT rules.
    b)  Packets with these source IP addresses are dropped by the
    	'nosmurfs' interface option and by the 'dropSmurfs' action.
    c)  Packets with these destination IP addresses are not logged
        during policy enforcement.
    d)  Packets with these destination IP addresses are processes by
    	the 'Broadcast' action.
    Beginning with this release, individual network interfaces can be
    excluded from this treatment through use of the 'omitanycast'
    option in /etc/shorewall6/interfaces.
    Note: This option was named 'noanycast' in earlier Beta releases.
    + Duplicate function names have been eliminated between the
    Shorewall-core lib.cli shell library and the Shorewall lib.cli-std
    library.
    + The 'status' command in Shorewall[6]-lite now precedes the
    configuration directory name with the administrative host name
    separated with a colon (":").
    + Tuomo Soini has contributed a macro that handles NFS v1.4 (no
    dynamic ports).
- Packaging:
  + Add buildrequires for pkgconfig (missing)
  + Use macro for sbindir

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 22 09:27:03 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to version 5.2.7
  + **Upgrade your configuration**
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.7/releasenotes.txt
  + Previously, it was not possible to classify traffic by destination
    IP address when using an Intermediate Functional Block (IFB) for
    traffic shaping. This is because such classification takes place
    before the traffic passes through the mangle PREROUTING chain.
    Such filtering is now possible by setting the 'connmark' option in
    the tcdevices file. This option causes the current connection mark
    to be copied to the packet mark prior to filtering, thus allowing
    the packet mark to be used for classification.
    This change adds a new CONNMARK_ACTION capability which is
    required to be able to specify the 'connmark' option.
  + The tcpri file now supports ?FORMAT 2 which inserts an SPORT
    column directly to the right of the PORT column. As part of this
    change, the PORT column is renamed to DPORT while allowing both
    'port' and 'dport' to be used in the alternate input format. See
    shorewall-tcpri(5) and
    http://shorewall.org/simple_traffic_shaping.html for additional
    information.
  + The Simple TC document is now linked to FAQs 97 and 97a.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  7 11:31:48 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to version 5.2.6
  + **Upgrade your configuration**
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.6/releasenotes.txt
  + When compiling for export, the compiler generates a firewall.conf
    file which is later installed on the remote firewall system as
    ${VARDIR}/firewall.conf. Previously, the CLI on that firewall was
    not processing the file, resulting in some features not being
    available:
    - Default values for VERBOSITY, LOGFILE, LOGFORMAT, PATH,
      SHOREWALL_SHELL, SUBSYSLOCK, RESTOREFILE, RESTART,
      DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST and PAGER are not supplied.
    - scfilter file supplied at compile time.
    - dumpfilter file supplied at compile time.
    That has been corrected.
  + A bug in iptables (see
    https://git.netfilter.org/iptables/commit/?id=d1555a0906e35ba8d170613d5a43da64e527dbe1)
    prevents the '--queue-cpu-fanout' option from being applied unless
    that option is the last one specified. Unfortunately, Shorewall
    places the '--queue-bypass' option last if that option is also
    specified.
    This release works around this issue by ensuring that the
    '--queue-cpu-fanout' option appears last.
  + The -D 'compile', 'check', 'reload' and 'Restart'  option was
    previously omitted from the output of 'shorewall help'. It is now
    included. As part of this change, an incorrect and conflicting
    description of the -D option was removed from the 'remote-restart'
    section of shorewall(8).
  + Previously, when EXPAND_POLICIES=No, chains that enforced ACCEPT
    policies were not completely optimized by optimize level 2 (ACCEPT
    rules preceding the final unconditional ACCEPT were not
    deleted). That has been corrected such that these rules are now
    optimized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 13:24:45 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to version 5.2.5.2
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.5/releasenotes.txt
  + 5.2.5.2
    Previously, ";;+" was mishandled in the snat file; the generated
    rule incorrectly included the leading "+". That has been corrected
    so that the generated rule is now correct.
    Example (SNAT OpenVPN server traffic leaving on eth0):
       SNAT(192.2.0.4)    -      eth0     ;;+ -p udp --sport 1194
  + 5.2.5.1
    - The change in 5.2.5 base which changed the 'user' facility to the
    'daemon' facility in Shorewall syslog messages did not change the
    messages with severity 'err'. That has been corrected such that
    all syslog messages now use the 'daemon' facility.
    - The actions.std file contains "?IF...?ELSE...?ENDIF" sequences
    that provide different action options depending on the availabilty
    of certain capabilities. This has resulted in the Broadcast and
    Multicast options being listed twice in the output of
    "shorewall[6] show actions". Beginning with this release, this
    duplication is eliminated. Note, however, that the options shown
    will be incomplete if they were continued onto another line, and
    may be incorrect for Broadcast and Multicast.
    - A typo in shorewall-providers(5) has been corrected.
  + 5.2.5 Base
    - Previously, Shorewall-init installed a 'shorewall' script in
    /etc/network/if-down.d on Debian and derivatives. This script was
    unnecessary and required Debian-specific code in the generated
    firewall script. The Shorewall-init script is no longer installed
    and the generated firewall script is now free of
    distribution-specific code.
    - Also on Debian and derivatives, Shorewall-init installed
    /etc//NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01-shorewall which was also
    unnecessary.  Beginning with this release, that file is no longer
    installed.
    - Previously, if the dynamic-blacklisting default timeout was set in
    a variable in the params file and the variable was used in setting
    DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST, then the 'allow' command would fail with
    the message:
        ERROR: Invalid value (ipset-only,disconnect,timeout=) for
               DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST
    That has been corrected.
    - When EXPAND_POLICIES=No in shorewall[6].conf, policies in complex
    rulesets are enforced in chains such as 'net-all' and
    'all-all'. Previously, these chains included redundant
    state-oriented rules. In addition to being redundant. these rules
    could actually break complex IPv6 configurations. The extra rules are
    now omitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 26 17:00:46 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to bugfix version 5.2.4.5
  + The description of the 'optional' option has been expanded in
    shorewall-interfaces(5).
  + Previously, the AUTOMAKE option did not work properly when
    /etc/shorewall[6] was a symbolic link. That has been corrected.
- Packaging
  + Remove broken %pretrans, move content to %pre
  + Remove use of %release in rpm scriptlet
  + This will avoid constant rebuild.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 30 08:19:02 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to bugfix version 5.2.4.4
  + When DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset... or when SAVE_IPSETS=Yes in
    shorewall[6].conf, 'shorewall[6] start' could hang. Fixed.
  + 'shorewall[6] start' would not automatically create dynamic
    blacklisting ipsets. That has been corrected.
- This version will served also as maintenance upgrade for Leap

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 14:50:24 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to version 5.2.4.2

  + Fixes for debian
- Update to version 5.2.4.1
  + Fixes for openSUSE shorewall-init
  will now ignore 'start' and 'stop' commands, for running firewalls
  + Spurious messages have been removed
- Packaging
  + Move /usr/sbin/shorewall to shorewall-core so -lite version
    doesn't need main shorewall package
  + To make shorewall remote-* command working we patch lib.cli-std
    to use /usr/sbin instead of /sbin + commented spec
  + Desactivate for the moment the upgrade warning. we need to
    find a 100% working solution.
  + use %{var} form everywhere

Tue Apr 14 14:35:51 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Add perl-base as buildrequirement to force choice of SHA-DIGEST
  new problem in TW
- To fix boo#1166114 never restart shorewall-init.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  4 07:31:53 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Remove shorewall require from shorewall-init (was a forgoten
  action)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 31 14:37:38 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to version 5.2.4
  https://shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.2/shorewall-5.2.4/releasenotes.txt
  + Previously, when a Shorewall6 firewall was placed into the
    'stopped' state, ICMP6 packets required by RFC 4890 were not
    automatically accepted by the generated ruleset.
    Beginning with this release, those packets are automatically
    accepted.
  + Previously, the output of 'shorewall[6] help' displayed the
    superseded 'load' command. That text has been deleted.
  + The QOSExample.html file in the documentation and on the web site
    previously showed tcrules content for the /etc/shorewall/mangle
    file (recall that 'mangle' superseded 'tcrules'). That page has
    been corrected.
  + The 'Starting and Stopping' and 'Configuration file basics'
    documents have been updated to align them with the current product
    behavior.
  +  The 'ipsets' document has been updated to clarify the use of
    ipsets in the stoppedrules file.
- Packaging
  + shorewall-init package has a removed %service_del_postun
    macro to close bug boo#1166114 Restarting this service can
    lock down admin out of the system.
  + shorewall(6) and shorewall(6)-lite conflict has they shouldn't
    be installed together on the same system.
  + conf_update flag is set to 1 to activate update reminder
  + Adjust and cleanup requires

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 15 19:34:02 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Add version to requires in -lite version

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 13:53:14 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to minor bugfix version 5.2.3.7
  + When DOCKER=Yes, if both the DOCKER-ISOLATE and
    DOCKER-ISOLATE-STAGE-1 existed then the DOCKER-ISOLATE-STAGE-*
    chains were not preserved through shorewall state changes.
    That has been corrected so that both chains are preserved if
    present.
  + Previously, the compiler always detected the OLD_CONNTRACK_MATCH
    capability as being available in IPv6. When OLD_CONNTRACK_MATCH
    was available, the compiler also mishandled inversion ('!') in the
    ORIGDEST columns, leading to an assertion failure.
    Both the incorrect capability detection and the mishandled
    inversion have been corrected.
  + During 'enable' processing, if address variables associated with
    the interface have values different than those when the firewall
    was last started/restarted/reloaded, then a 'reload' is performed
    rather than a simple 'enable'. The logic that checks for those
    changes was incorrect in some configurations, leading to unneeded
    reload operations. That has been corrected.
  + When MANGLE_ENABLED=No in shorewall[6].conf, some features
    requiring use of the mangle table can be allowed, even though the
    mangle table is not updated. That has been corrected such that use
    of such features will raise an error.
  + When the IfEvent(...,reset) action was invoked, the compiler
    previously emitted a spurious "Resetting..." message. That message
    has been suppressed.
- Packaging
  + Do not provide anymore unsused notrack file
  + Introduce define conf_need_update to track when we activate the
  post update warning for users when there's minor or major version
  update of shorewall bnc#1166114

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 17 12:09:31 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 07:27:41 UTC 2020 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to bugfix minor 5.2.3.5
  + A typo in the FTP documentation has been corrected.
  + The recommended mss setting when using IPSec with ipcomp
    has been corrected.
  + A number of incorrect links in the manpages have been
    corrected.
  + The 'bypass' option is now allowed when specifying an
    NFQUEUE policy. Previously, specifying that option resulted
    in an error.
  + Corrected IPv6 Address Range parsing.
  + Previously, such ranges were required to be of the form
    [<addr1>-<addr2>] rather than the more standard form
    [<addr1>]-[<addr2>]. In the snat file (and in nat actions),
    the latter form was actually flagged as an error while in
    other contexts, it resulted in a less obvious error being
    raised.
  + The manpages have been updated to refer to
    https://shorewall.org rather than http://www.shorewall.org.
- Refresh spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  4 16:35:45 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

  + Update release documents.
  + Correct handling of multi-queue NFQUEUE as a policy.
  + Correct handling of multi-queue NFQUEUE as a macro parameter.
  + Make 'AUTOMAKE=No' the update default.
  + Correct the description of the 'bypass' NFQUEUE option in
    shorewall-rules(5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 15 08:41:56 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to bugfix minor 5.2.3.3
  Previously, if an ipset was specified in an SPORT column, the
  compiler would raise an error similar to:
  ERROR: Invalid ipset name () /etc/shorewall/rules (line 44)
- Update to bugfix minor 5.2.3.2
  Shorewall 5.2 automatically converts an existing 'masq' file to an
  equivalent 'snat' file. Regrettably, Shorewall 5.2.3 broke that
  automatic update, such that the following error message was issued:
   Use of uninitialized value $Shorewall::Nat::raw::currentline in
   pattern match (m//) at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Nat.pm
   line 511, <$currentfile> line nnn. and the generated 'masq'
  file contains only initial comments. That has been corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 15:52:39 UTC 2019 - Bruno Friedmann <bruno@ioda-net.ch>

- Update to bugfix minor 5.2.3.1 release
  + An issue in the implementation of policy file zone exclusion,
    released in 5.2.3 has been resolved. In the original release,
    if more than one zone was excluded then the following error was
    raised:
        ERROR: 'all' is not allowed in a source zone list
                etc/shorewall/policy (line ...)

Wed Jun 21 12:53:37 UTC 2017 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- This stable branch 5.1x will be the new default for Leap 42.3.
  Remember that each time you have an upgrade with changes in Major
  or Major,Minor it is mandatory you upgrade your configuration
  with shorewall(6) update -a /etc/shorewall(6) command.

- Packaging : use pretrans and posttrans to inform user about
  configuration upgrade.

- Bugfix release 5.1.4.3. Problem Corrected:
  When running on prior-generation distributions such as RHEL6,
  IPv6 multi-ISP configurations failed to start due to an error
  such as the following:

   ERROR: Command "ip -6 -6 route replace default scope global
          table 250 nexthop via ::192.88.99.1 dev tun6to4 weight 1"
          Failed
  Such configurations now start successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 14 09:06:19 UTC 2017 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Bugfix and enhancement release 5.1.4.2
  complete changelog is available
  http://shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/5.1/shorewall-5.1.4/releasenotes.txt
- Main changes
  All IPv6 standard actions have been deleted and their logic
  has been added to their IPv4 counterparts who can now handle
  both address families.

  Previously, ?error and ?require messages as well as verbose ?info
  and ?warning messages (those that report the file and line numbers)
  generated from an action file would report the action file name and
  line number rather than the file and line number where the action
  was invoked. The file and line number where the action was invoked
  were listed second. Beginning with this release, the invoking file
  and line number are listed first and the action file and line number
  are not reported. This allows for creation of clearer messages.

  IPv6 UPnP support (including MINIUPNPD) is now available.

  A PERL_HASH_SEED option has been added to allow the Perl hash seed
  to be specified.  See shorewall.conf(5) and perlsec(1) for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 25 15:41:04 UTC 2017 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Bugfix release 5.1.3.2
  Previously, if a Shorewall Variable (e.g., @chain) was the target
  of a conditional ?RESET directive (one that was enclosed in ?if.
  ?else...?endif logic), the compiler could incorrectly use an
  existing chain created from the action rather than creating a new
  (and different) chain. That has been corrected.

  Previously, if alternate input format specified a column that had
  already been specified, the contents of that column were silently
  overwritten. Now, a warning message is issued stating that the
  prior value has been replaced by the newer value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 19 17:33:42 UTC 2017 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to last bugfix version 5.1.3.1
  Problems Corrected:
  There was a typo in the BLACKLIST_DEFAULT settings in the 5.1.3
  sample config files, which resulted in a compilation error.
  That typo has been corrected.

  There was also a typo in the two-interface IPv4 sample snat file;
  192.168.0.0/16 was inadvertently entered as 92.168.0.0/16. That has
  been corrected.

  Previously, when processing the policy file, 'all+' was incorrectly
  treated the same as 'all'. That has been corrected so that 'all+'
  causes intra-zone traffic to be included in the policy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  6 11:14:41 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to last 4x bugfix version 4.6.13.4
  For details see changelog.txt and releasenotes.txt

	- 4.6.13.4
	* This release includes a couple of additional configure/install
    fixes from Matt Darfeuille.

	* The DROP command was previously rejected in the mangle file.
	That has been corrected.

	- 4.6.13.3
	* Previously, Shorewall6 rejected rules in which the SOURCE
	contained both an interface name and a MAC address (in
	Shorewall format). That defect has been corrected so that such
	rules are now accepted.

	* A number of corrections have been made to the install,
	uninstall and configure scripts (Matt Darfeuille).

	* Previously, optional interfaces were not enabled during 'start'
	and 'restart' unless there was at least one entry in the
	'providers' file.  This resulted in these interfaces not
	appearing in the output of 'shorewall[6] status -i'.

	* The check for use of a circular kernel log buffer (as opposed
	to a log file) has been improved.

	* Previously, if a circular log buffer was being used, the output
	of various commands still displayed '/var/log/messages' as the
	log file. Now, it is displayed as 'logread'.

	* When processing the 'dump' command, the CLI now uses 'netstat'
	to print socket information when the 'ss' utility is not
	installed.

	- 4.6.13.2
	* Previously, if statistical load balancing was used in the
	providers file, the default route in the main table was not
	deleted during firewall start/restart. That route is now
	correctly deleted.

	- 4.6.13.1
	* Previously, the 'reset' command would fail if chain names were
    included. Now, the command succeeds, provided that all of the
    specified chains exist in the filter table.

	* The TCP meta-connection is now supported by the Tinc macro and
    tunnel type. Previously, only the UDP data connection was
    supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 15 09:22:51 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.13 For more details see changelog.txt and
  realeasenotes.txt

  * The 'rules' file manpages have been corrected regarding the
    packets that are processed by rules in the NEW section.

  * Parsing of IPv6 address ranges has been corrected. Previously,
    use of ranges resulted in 'Invalid IPv6 Address' errors.

  * The shorewall6-hosts man page has been corrected to show the
    proper contents of the HOST(S) column.

  * Previously, INLINE statements in the mangle file were not
    recognized if a chain designator (:F, :P, etc.) followingowed
    INLINE(...). As a consequence, additional matches following
    a semicolon were interpreted as column/value pairs unless
    INLINE_MATCHES=Yes, resulting in compilation failure.

  * Inline matches on IP[6]TABLE rules could be ignored if
    INLINE_MATCHES=No. They are now recognized.

  * Specifying an action with a logging level in one of the
    _DEFAULT options in shorewall[6].conf
    (e.g., REJECT_DEFAULT=Reject:info) produced a compilation error:

      ERROR: Invalid value (:info) for first Reject parameter
           /usr/share/shorewall/action.Rejectect (line 52)

    That has been corrected. Note, however, that specifying logging
    with a default action tends to defeat one of the main purposes
    of default actions which is to suppress logging.

  * Previously, it was necessary to set TC_EXPERT=Yes to have full
    access to the user mark in fw marks. That has been corrected so
    that any place that a mark or mask can be specified, both the
    TC mark and the User mark are accessible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 14 09:48:08 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.11 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, when the -c option was given to the 'compile'
    command, the progress message "Compiling..." was issued before
    it was determined if compilation was necessary.  Now, that message
    is suppressed when re-compilation is not required.

  * Previously, when the -c option was given to the 'compile'
    command, the 'postcompile' extension script was executed even when
    there was no (re-)compilation. Now, the 'postcompile' script is
    only invoked  when a new script is generated.

  * If CONFDIR was other than /etc, then ordinary users would not
    receive a clear error message when they attempted to execute
    one of the commands that change the firewall state.

  * Previously, IPv4 DHCP client broadcasts were blocked by the
    'rpfilter' interface option. That has been corrected.

  * The 'update' command incorrectly added the INLINE_MATCHES
    option to shorewall6.conf with a default value of 'Yes'. This
    caused 'start' to fail with invalid ip6tables rules when the alternate
    input format using ';' is used.

    Note: This last issue is not documented in the release notes
    included with the release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 17 06:43:22 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.10.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Indentation is now consistent in lib.core (Tuomo Soini).

  * The first problem corrected in 4.6.10 below was incomplete. It
    is now complete (Tuomo Soini).

  * Similarly, the second fix was also incomplete and is now
    completed  (Tuomo Soini).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 16:39:16 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.9 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release contains defect repair from Shorewall 4.6.8.1 and
    earlier releases.

  * The means for preventing loading of helper modules has been
    clarified in the documentation.

  * The SetEvent and ResetEvent actions previously set/reset the
    event even if the packet did not match the other specified
    columns. This has been corrected.

  * Previously, the 'show capabilities' command was ignoring the
    HELPERS setting. This resulted in unwanted modules being
    autoloaded  and, when the -f option was given, an incorrect
    capabilities file was generated.

  * Previously, when 'wait' was specified for an interface, the
    generated script erroneously checked for required interfaces on
    all commands rather than just start, restart and restore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 14 22:06:55 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.8.1 For more details see changnlog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, when servicd was installed and there were one or
    more required interfaces, the firewall would fail to start at
    boot.This has been corrected by Tuomo Soini.

  * Some startup logic in lib.cli has been deleted. A bug prevented
    the code from working as intended, so there is no loss of
    functionality resulting from deletion of the code.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  4 08:29:52 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.8 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes defect repair from Shorewall 4.6.6.2 and
    earlier releases.

  * Previously, when the -n option was specified and NetworkManager
    was installed on the target system, the Shorewall-init installer
    would still create
    ${DESTDIR}etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01-shorewall, regardless
    of the setting of $CONFDIR. That has been corrected such that
    the directory
    ${DESTDIR}${CONFDIR}/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/01-shorewall
    is created instead.

  * Previously, handling of the IPTABLES and IP6TABLES actions in
    the conntrack file was broken. nfw provided a fix on IRC.

  * The Shorewall-core and Shorewall6 installers would previously
    report incorrectly that the product release was not installed.
    Matt Darfeuille provided fixes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 13 07:52:35 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.7 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes defect repair from Shorewall 4.6.6.2 and
    earlier releases.
  * The 'tunnels' file now supports 'tinc' tunnels.
  * Previously, the SAME action in the mangle file had a fixed
    timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes). That action now allows
    specification of a different timeout.
  * It is now possible to add or delete addresses from an ipset
    with entries in the mangle file. The ADD and DEL actions have
    the same behavior in the mangle file as they do in the rules
    file.

- Added systemd_version macro in anticipation of detecting the
  correct service file when systemd version is >= 214

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  7 01:27:59 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.6.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The compiler failed to parse the construct +<ipset>[n] where n is
    an integer (e.g., +bad[2]).

  * Orion Paplawski has provided a patch that adds 'ko.xz' to the
    default MODULE_SUFFIX setting. This change deals with recent
    Fedora releases where the module names now end with ".ko.xz".

    In addition to Orion's patch, the sample configurations have
    been modified to specify MODULE_SUFFIX="ko ko.xz".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 24 08:23:16 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.6.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously the SAVE and RESTORE actions were erroneously disallowed
    in the INPUT chain within the mangle file.
  * The manpage descriptions of the mangle SAVE and RESTORE actions
    incorrectly required a slash (/) prior to the mask value.
  * Race conditions could previously occur between the 'start'
    command and the 'enable' and 'disable' commands.
  * The 'update' command incorrectly added the INLINE_MATCHES
    option to shorewall.conf with a default value of 'Yes'. This
    caused 'start' to fail with invalid iptables rules when the
    alternate input format using ';' is used.
  * Previously the LOCKFILE setting was not propagated to the
    generated script. So when the script was run directly, the script
    unconditionally used ${VARDIR}/lock.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 17 12:07:10 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.6 For more details see changlelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt As there are many new features with this release
  please consult the mentioned files.

  * Previously, a line beginning with 'shell' was interpreted as a
    shell script. Now, the line must begin with 'SHELL'
    (case-sensitive).

    Note that ?SHELL and BEGIN SHELL are still case-insensitive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 12 08:38:42 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.5.5 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release adds Tuomo Soini's fix for Shorewall-init to 4.6.5.5.
    Previously, the ifupdown scripts were looking in the wrong
    directory for the firewall script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 10 21:37:09 UTC 2015 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.5.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The '-c' option of the 'dump' and 'show routing' commands is
    now documented.
  * The handling of the 'DIGEST' environmental variable has been
    corrected in the Shorewall installer. Previously, specifying
    that option would not correctly update the Chains module which
    led to a Perl compilation failure.
  * Handling of ipset names in PORT columns has been corrected.
    Previously, such usage resulted in an invalid  iptables rule
    being generated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 18 00:10:54 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.5.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The Shorewall-init scripts were using the incorrect
    variable to set the state directory. Correction provided by
    Roberto Sanchez.
  * For normal dynamic zones, the 'add' command failed with a
    diagnostic such as:

      ERROR: Zone ast, interface net0 does not have a dynamic host
      list
  * When a mark range was used in the marks (tcrules) file, a
    run-time error occurred while attempting to load the generated
     ruleset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 11 21:07:03 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Do not buildrequire openSUSE-release: it's a daily changing
  package and causes thus frequent rebuilds for no reason.
  configure and install both try to guess the target from
  /etc/os-release. So we simply inject BUILD=suse for the openSUSE
  case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 23 23:20:00 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.5.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * LOG_BACKEND=LOG failed at run-time for all but the most recent
    kernels.

- Changes in 4.6.5.1

  * The generated script can now detect an gateway address assigned
    by later versions of that program (Alan Barrett).

  * In 4.6.5, the bash-based configure script would issue the
    following diagnostic if SERVICEDIR was not specified in the
    shorewallrc file:

      ./configure: line 199: [SERVICEDIR]=: command not found

    This was compounded by the fact that all of the released
    shorewallrc files still specified SYSTEMDDIR rather than
    SERVICEDIR (Evangelos Foutras)

  * The shorewallrc.archlinux file now reflects a change in SBINDIR
    that occurred in Arch Linux in mid 2013 (Evangelos Foutras).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  5 07:45:56 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to versioin 4.6.4.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The fix for LOG_BACKEND in 4.6.4.2 worked on some older
    distributions but not on newer ones. This release fixes the
    problem in the remaining cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 22 06:09:49 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.3.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The 'Universal' configurations previously failed to start with
    the diagnostic

      ERROR: No network interface available: Firewall state not
      changed

   * A defect introduced in 4.6.3 prevented Shorewall-init from
     starting when required interfaces were present.

   * Some defect repair from 4.6.2.5 was inadvertently omitted from
     4.6.3. In particular, the fix for Shorewall-init on systems
     running  systemd was omitted. Those fixes have now been merged
     into this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 13 16:59:52 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.3.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Including a PREROUTING SECTION in the accounting file
    unconditionally resulted in a fatal error:

    ERROR: The PREROUTING SECTION is not allowed when
           ACCOUNTING_TABLE=filter

  * Previously, the compiler could generate many superfluous rules
    to enforce the 'tcpflags', 'nosmurfs' and 'maclist' interface
    options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  4 08:31:42 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.3.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * The shorewall[6]-actions manpages previously contained incorrect
    examples of the usage of table names with builtin actions.

    Incorrect:

    FOOBAR,filter,mangle

    Correct:

    FOOBAR   builtin,filters,mangle
  * Previously, if /etc/iproute2/rt_tables was not writeable, then
    KEEP_RT_TABLES=No behaved like KEEP_RT_TABLES=Yes. Now, a
    warning  message is issued if that file is not writeable and
    KEEP_RT_TABLES is set to No.

    WARNING: /etc/iproute2/rt_tables is missing or is not
    writeable
  * In earlier 4.6.3 versions, the help text from shorewall-lite
    and shorewall6-lite included two versions of the 'run' command.

      run <command> [ <parameter> ... ]
      ..
      run <function> [ <parameter> ... ]

    The second one has now been deleted.

  * New Features:
    Eric Teeter has contributed a Citrix Goto Meeting macro.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 31 17:24:13 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.3.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.tx
  * The DNSAmp action released in 4.6.3 matched more packets than it
    should have. That has now been corrected.
  * The handling of REJECT in IP[6]TABLES rules has been clarified
    inthe shorewall-rules(5) and shorewall6-rules(5) manpages.
  * The following misleading error message has now been corrected:

      ERROR: The xxx TARGET is now allowed in the filter table

    The message now reads:

  * Previously, when an interface specified the 'physical=' option and
    the physical interface name was specified in the INTERFACES
    column of the providers file, compilation would fail with diagnostics
    similar to the following:

  * Previously, the compiler would fail with a Perl diagnostic if:
    + Optimize Level 8 was enabled.
    + Perl 5.20 was being used. This is the current Perl version on
      Arch Linux.
    The diagnostic was:

      Can't use string ("nat") as a HASH ref while "strict refs" in
      use at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 3486.

Fri Jul 25 21:23:20 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.2.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The compiler now correctly detects the IPv6 "Header Match"
    capability when LOAD_MODULES_ONLY=No.

  * The compiler now correctly detects the IPv6 "Ipset Match"
    capability on systems running a 3.14 or later kernel.

  * The compiler now correctly detects "Arptables JF" capability
    when LOAD_MODULES_ONLY=No.

  * The tcfilter manpages previously failed to mention that
    BASIC_FILTERS=Yes is required to use ipsets in the tcfilters
    files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 20 22:28:42 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.2.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Two issues with tcrules processing have been corrected:
    + SAVE and RESTORE generated fatal compilation errors.
    + '|' and '&' were ignored. That issue is also present in the
      processing of the mangle file
  * Version 4.6.2 changes
    + The DSCP match in the mangle and tcrules files didn't work
      with service class names such as EF, BE, CS1, ...
    + The SAVE and RESTORE actions were disallowed in the OUTPUT
      chain in tcrules and mangle; this was a regression from 4.5.21.
    + Additional ports required by Asus, Supermicro and Dell have
      beenadded to the IPMI macro (Tuomo Soini).
    +  Some issues regarding install under Cygwin64 have been
       addressed.
      - configure.pl did not understand CYGWIN returned from `uname`
      - Shorewall-core install.sh did not understand CYGWIN returned
        from  `uname`.
      - The Shorewall and Shorewall6 installers tried to run the
        command 'mkdir -p //etc/shorewall[6]' which is broken in the
        current Cygwin64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  5 16:02:24 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.1.4 For more details see changelog.txt and

 * The DSCP match in the mangle and tcrles files didn't work with
    service class names such as EF, BE, CS1, ... (Thibaut Chèze)
 * The SAVE and RESTORE actions were disallowed in the OUTPUT
   chain in tcrules and mangle; this was a regression from 4.5.21.

  * Use of the 'IfEvent' action resulted in a compilation failure:

     ERROR: -j is only allowed when the ACTION is INLINE with no
     parameter /usr/share/shorewall/action.IfEvent (line 139)
     from /etc/shorewall/action.SSHKnock (line 8)
     from /etc/shorewall/rules (line 31)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 19 10:47:13 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.1.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * An improved error message is generatred when a server address
    list is specified in the DEST colume of a DNAT or REDIRECT
    rule. At one time, iptables supported such lists, but now only
    a single address or an address range is supported.

    The previous error message was:

    ERROR: Unkknown Host (192.168.1.4,192.168.1.22)

    The new error message is:

    ERROR: An address list (192.168.1.4,192.1688.1.22) is not
       allowed in the DEST column of a xxx RULE

    whenere xxx is DNAT or REDIRECT as appropriate.
  * Two problems have been corrected in the Shorewall-init Debian
    init script.
   + A cosmetic problem which releasenotessulted in 'echo_notdone'
     being displayed on failure rather than 'nott done'.
   + More seriously, the test for the existance of compiled
     firewall scripts was incorrect, with the result that the
     firewallingall scripts were not executed.
     These defects, introduced in Shorewall 4.5.17, have now been
     corrected.

- Restating that CHECKSUM.patch is removed since braindead
  factory-auto scripts do not understand previous comment
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 10 11:05:46 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The release notes in the packages mention a fix for
    'rpfilter'. That defect was actually corrected in 4.5.6.9 with
     a slightly different description in the release notes.

  * Tuomo Soini has provided new macros for AMOP, MongoDB, Redis,
   Sieve and IPMI (RMCP).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  2 07:19:16 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.0.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * 1:1 NAT is now enabled in IPv6.
  * subtle interaction between NAT and sub-zones is explained in
    shorewall-nat.
  * The 'show filters' command now works with Simple TC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 27 10:42:42 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.0.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The 'upgrade -A' command now converts the tcrules file to a
    mangle file. Previously, that didn't happen.
  * The install components now support RHEL7.
  * Whitespace issues in the skeleton configuration files have been
    corrected (Tuomo Soini).
  * FAQ 2e has been added which describes additional steps required
    to achieve hairpin NAT on a bridge where the modified packets are
    to go out the same bridge port as they entered.
  * shorewall-masq(5) has been corrected to include the word SOURCE
    on the description of that column. Previously, the description
    read '(formerly called SUBNET)'.
  * The output of 'shorewall show filters' once again shows ingress
    (policing) filters. This works around undocumented changes to
    the behavior of the 'tc' utility.

- removed backported CHECKSUM.patch
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 16 06:59:57 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.6.0. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt. Since this is a major release for those who are
  migrating from previous version, it is important to read the
  above mentioned notes.

  * This release includes all defect repair from releases up through
    4.5.21.9.
- Backported CHECKSUM.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  1 07:22:50 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.9 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The output of 'shorewall show capabilities' always showed the
    'Recent match --reap option' as 'Not Available'. 'shorewall
    show -fcapabilities' correctly reported the capability.

  * When a rules file section other than NEW began with a ?COMMENT
    directive, the comment would erroneously appear in the rule
    which jumps to the section chain as well as in the rules directly
    related to the following entries.

  * Rule comments were omitted from the compiler's 'trace' output
    in some cases.

  * When FASTACCEPT=Yes, ESTABLISHED,RELATED accept rules were
    incorrectly omitted from an interfaces's _in and _fwd chains
    when 'rpfilter' was specified in the interfaces's entry in
    /etc/shorewall[6]/interfaces.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 20 08:07:23 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.8 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * If an rtrules entry duplicated a Shorewall-generated route rule but
    had a lower priority than the generated one has (20000), then a
    disable/enable sequence on the provider would result in
    duplicate rules with priority 20000.

  *  When 'shorewall[6] debug [re]start' was run, any error messages
    generated because of ip[6]tables command errors would not
    include '-t table'.

- Remove 0001-fix-release-version.patch
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  8 16:52:25 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.7 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The help text for the 'dump' command has been updated to
    include all valid options.

  * The behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is corrected.
    Previously, 'shorewall stop' would not block existing connections
    regardless of the setting of this option. Beginning with this
    release, the behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No depends on whether
    the  routestopped or the stoppedrules file defines the allow
    connections while the firewall is stopped.

    If there are entries in /etc/shorewall[6]/routestopped or if
    there are no entries in /etc/shorewall[6]/stoppedrules, then the
    behavior of ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is as documented (existing
    connections are blocked unles they are allowed by
    /etc/shorewall[6]/routestopped).  If there are no entries in
    /etc/shorewall[6]/stoppedrules, then the behavior is as if
    ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes and a warning message is generated.

- Add 0001-fix-release-version.patch to correct version info of the
  releasenotes.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  2 12:04:06 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.6 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * When a non-terminating target specified logging, the compiler
    would erroneously generate a 'goto' (-g) iptables command rather
    than a 'jump' (-j) command. This caused the wrong set of rules
    to be traversed, usually the catchall 'REJECT' or 'DROP' rule
    at theend of the INPUT or FORWARD chain.

    The compiler now generates a 'jump' rule in these cases.

   * When an interface containing a period (such as a VLAN
     interfaceterface) was used in an 'add' or 'delete' command,
     the wrong ipset name was generated, resulting in failure of
     the command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 21 08:00:02 UTC 2014 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.5 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * A number of minor updates have been made to the documentation
    and manpages.
  * The 'postcompile' extension script is now documented at
    http://www.shorewall.org/shorewall_extension_scripts.htm
  * The 'add' command previously failed if 'IPSET=' appeared in the
    shorewall.conf file. This has been corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 16:29:14 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The Broadcast actions have been corrected:
    - --dst-type BROADCAST has been removed from the IPv6 version
    - A superfluous DROP rule in the IPv4 version has been
      suppressed.
  * Previously, if an HFSC class was specified with dmax but not
     umax, then the firewall would fail to start with the messages:

      Nov 14 13:42:42 Setting up Traffic Control...
      HFSC: Illegal "umax"
      HFSC: Illegal "sc"
      ERROR: Command "tc class add dev eth1 parent 1:1 classid
      1:110  hfsc sc umax b dmax 150ms rate 1575kbit ul rate 3150kbit"
      Failed

    That problem has been corrected.
  * The tcrules file now supports DROP entries to allow early
    dropping of DOS packets.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 17:31:29 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, the AutoBL action would fail if the kernel and
    iptables did not support the Recent Match '--reap' option. A new
    REAP_OPTION  capability has been added to work around this issue.

  * The Shorewall-core installer no longer reports an error from
    'cp' stating that it could not stat the shorewallrc file.

  * When a non-root user attempts to execute 'version -a', the CLI
    no longer attempts to get the version of the compiled
    firewall. Previously, the command issued the following
    diagnostic when run by non-root:

     /sbin/shorewall: /var/lib/shorewallhorewall/firewall:
     Permission denied

  * Shorewall no longer uses 'fgrep' thus allowing for use on
    systems without that utility. All uses of 'fgrep' have been
    replaced by 'grep -F'.

  * Placing |<mark> in the ACTION column of the tcrules file no
    longer raises a fatal compilation error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 08:40:25 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Problems with the Shorewall Init installer (install.sh) were
    corrected. These problems affected initial Gentoo and Debian
    installs.

  * A problem that prevented multiple ICMP/ICMP6 types to be
    specified in a rule has been corrected.

  * Previously, an attempt to specify RAS or Q.931 in the HELPER
    column  was rejected with an error.

  * The 'nohostroute' provider option was not honored in the
    default table when USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  3 17:23:05 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.21 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * ip[6]tables 1.4.20 introduced an incompatible change that
    causes the program to fail if there is another instance of either
    iptables or ip6tables already running. This behavior can be avoided
    if the new -w option is specified.

    To work around this problem, the compiler now uses the -w
    option (when available) during capabilities determination so that
    shorewall and shorewall6 compilations can proceed in parallel.

  * Previously, the Shorewall-init installer unconditionally
    installed the sysconfig file even when a different SYSCONFFILE was
    specified. (Thomas D).

  * /sbin/shorewall-init now includes the correct SYSCONFDIR name
    in its error message that reports the absense of
     ${SYSCONFDIR}/shorewall-init. (Thomas D).

  * /sbin/shorewall-init and the Shorewall-init SysV init scripts
    now honor the setting of $OPTIONS.

  * The -lite installers now look in ${SHAREDIR} for the
    coreversion file rather than in /usr/share/.

  * If a Shorewall-lite installation used an
    /etc/shorewall-lite/vardir file to set a non-standard state
    directory, the administrative system would send the firewall
    and firewall.conf files to the wrong directory on the firewall
    system.

  * Previously, the compiler verified 'monthdays' specifications in
    the rules TIME column, but failed to include --monthdays in the
    generated rule. That omission has been corrected.

  * The Multicast DNS macros (mDNS and mDNSbi) now allow the entire
    non-priv port range (1024-65535) for the the dynamic unicast
    port. Previously, only the Linux 2.6+ dynamic port range
    (32768-65535) were allowed.

- Spec file changes
  * Add 0001-fillup-install.patch
  * Remove shorewall-init-4.5.15-install.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 28 08:48:50 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.20 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * A typographical error in the usage text produced by the -h
    command in the compiled firewall script has been corrected.
  * The handling of INITSOURCE is now uniform between the standard
    and the -lite installers.
  * Previously, when SYSCONFFILE was specified in shorewallrc, the
    installers would always install default.debian rather than the
    named file. That has been corrected.
- Spec file changes
  * removed the following pathces:
    0001-Os-release.patch
    0001-Fix-Exec-directory.patch

  * Previously, the '-q' option did not suppress all output from
    certain commands such as 'check'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 30 23:12:01 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Spec file changes
  * Added 0001-Fix-Exec-directory.patch which fixes ExecStart

Sun Jun 30 10:29:17 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.18 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes all defect repair from Shorewall
    4.5.17.1.

  * The following warning message could be emitted inappropriately
    when running shorewall 4.5.17.

      The rule(s) generated by this entry are unreachable and have
      been discarded

    These warnings, which were disabled in Shorewall 4.5.17.1, are
    now only emitted where appropriate. The message has also been
    reworded to:

      One or more unreachable rules in chain <name> have been
      discarded

    The message is issued a maximum of once per Netfilter chain.

  * A problem that could cause the 'trace' compiler option to
    produce false error messages or to produce an altered generated
    firewall script has been corrected.

  * If the 'Owner Name Match' capability was not available, the
    following error message would previously appear during
    compilation:

      iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.

- spec file changes
  * rebased systemd.patch


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  5 22:27:44 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.17.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt.

   * The following warning message may be emitted inappropriately
     when running shorewall 4.5.17. The message is no longer issued.

      The rule(s) generated by  this entry are unreachable and have
      been discarded

    * Rules intended to increment nfacct objects would previously be
      optimized away when they immediately preceded an unconditional
      jump to the same target. Such rules are now retained.

    * A bug in the optimizer in 4.5.17 can cause 'set' and 'geoip'
      matches to be dropped. That has been corrected.

- spec file changes
  * rebased systemd.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 08:27:18 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.15 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, the Shorewall and Shorewall6 install.sh scripts did
    two things wrong with respect to the /etc/shorewall[6]/routes
    file:

    + The existing file was unconditionally removed.
    + A skeleton file was not installed when SPARSE was not set in
      the shorewallrc file.

    Additionally, the installer would remove /etc/shorewall[6]/tcstart

  * The Shorewall-init install.sh script previously refused to
    replace /sbin/ifup-local and /sbin/ifdown-local when those files has
    been installed by an earlier version of Shorewall-init.

  * Previously, Shorewall-init's integration with NetworkManager
    was incomplete on SuSE with the result that NetworkManager
    interface change events were not processed. That has been corrected.

  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.8, Shorewall6 has interpreted /32
    networks as hosts (/128). /32 IPv6 networks are once again
    handled correctly.

  * Using names such as such as EF, BE, CS1, ... for DSCP didn't
    work previously. Thibaut Chèze has provided a fix.

  * An incorrect range test prevented DSCP classes CS6 and CS7 from
    being accepted. The test has been corrected and those classes
    are now allowed.

- spec file changes
  * rebased systemd.patch
  * added shorewall-init-4.5.15-install.patch and removed
    shorewall-init-4.5.2-install.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 11 16:14:04 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.14 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, a list of IPv6 host addresses where each address
    was enclosed in square brackets generated a fatal compile-time
    error.

    Such lists are now handled correctly.

  * The Shorewall 'load', 'reload' and 'export' commands have now
    been modified to use a shorewallrc file in a remote system's export
    directory. If the directory layout of the remote system differs
    from that of the administrative system, then the remote
    system's export directory should contains a copy of that system's
    shorewallrc file.

  * A syntax error in the Shorewall uninstall.sh file has been
    eliminated.

  * The contents of the various configpath files have been
    corrected.

  * The Shorewall uninstall.sh script previously failed to remove
    the  macro files from ${SHAREDIR}/shorewall. Those files are now
    removed.

  * The 'version -a' command now prints the correct shorewall-core
    version when it is run from shorewall6, shorewall-lite and
    shorewall6-lite.

  * It is now possible to specify a port or port range along with
    an address variable in the ADDRESSES column of/etc/shorewall/masq.

    Example:

    #INTERFACE      SOURCE          ADDRESS         PROTO   DEST
    #                                                       PORT(S)
      eth0            172.20.4.0/24   &eth0:44        tcp     45

    Previously, this usage generated a fatal compilation error.

  * Port numbers and service names may now be specified with the
    UDPLITE protocol.

  * The SUBSYSLOCK setting in the default shorewall6.conf file has
    been changed from /var/lock/subsys/shorewall to

Wed Feb 13 08:42:49 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.13 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * If a chain consisted of a single RETURN rule, optimize level 4
    would handle it incorrectly by moving the RETURN rule to the
    chain(s) that jumped to the single-rule chain. The optimizer
    now simply eliminates the chain and rule.

    As part of this change, the optimizer now deletes trailing
    RETURN  rules from chains.

  * If a default inline action was specified with parameters, the
    compiler would fail with an internal error.

  * The compiler was mis-handling simple arithmetic expressions
    consisting of a single number, evaluating the number as ''
    rather than as its numberic value.

- Rebased systemd.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 20 20:12:23 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.5.12 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release contains the defect repairs from Shorewall
    4.5.11.1 and 4.5.11.2.
  * Two defects associated with 'update -D' have been corrected.
    + shorewall.conf.bak is no longer deleted.
    + files that are not changed no longer have their mtime updated.
  * Inline actions in the RELATED and ESTABLISHED sections now work
    correctly.
  * The 'dropInvalid' built-in function now works correctly.
  * The compiler now generates an error when a protocol list is
    used in a context where only a single protocol name/number is
    accepted.
  * The generated script now correctly deletes Traffic Control
    configurations when CLEAR_TC=Yes. Previously, the
    configurations on interfaces with a '@xxxxxx' suffix in their
    names were not cleared.
  * Under very rare circumstances, optimize level 4 could leave a
    rule that jumped to a non-existant chain, causing
    iptables-restore to fail.
  * If an error was raised while compiling a default action, a Perl
    diagnostic could appear and the Shorewall error message would
    not be printed.
  * It is once again possible to use DNS names in rules without an
    interface name.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 15 15:52:36 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Added systemd.patch to fix the exec path (bnc# 798525)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 12 21:11:11 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.11.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Corrected fix 2 from 4.5.11.1.

  * 4.5.11.1

   Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10, if the name of an optional
   interface contained one or more characters that are not valid
   in a  shell function name, then the generated script would fail with
   a "syntax error: bad function name" shell diagnostic.

   That problem has been corrected so that a valid function name
   is generated.

  * The kernel modules supplied by xtables-addons are now listed in
    the modules.xtables files. They were previously omitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 17 18:46:22 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.10.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Correct typo in conntrack module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  9 11:07:53 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.10 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes all defect repair included in
    4.5.9.1-4.5.9.3.

  * Under rare circumstances, optimize level 16 could produce
    invalid iptables-restore input which would cause start/restart
    to fail.

  * Before this release, the 'started' script was run prior to
    copying the temporary script file (e.g., /var/lib/shorewall/.start)
    to /var/dir/shorewall/firewall. If the script failed, the copy
    would not take place even though the firewall had started
    successfully. The script is now copied before running the
    'started' script.

    If you compare the script generated by this release with one
    generated by a prior release, We suggest that you ignore
    whitespace changes (e.g., use the '-w' option in diff); that way,
    you can see the actual change more clearly.

  * AUTOCOMMENT=No now works correctly; previously, it behaved the
    same as AUTOCOMMENT=Yes.

  * A harmless extraneous comma has been deleted from the rule
    generated by action.RST.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 21 16:01:26 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.9.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

 * Previously, the rules in the 'routemark' chain did not specify
   a mask in the MARK target. While a mask isn't strictly necessary
   in those rules, one has been added to ally fears of those who read
   the  generated ruleset.

    Note: The 'routemark' chain is used to apply provider marks to
    packets received from 'track' provider interfaces. It is
    traversed  early in the mangle PREROUTING chain when no other
    marks have yet been applied to the packet.

 * If exclusion was used with TPROXY in the tcrules file, an
   invalid  iptables ruleset was generated causing start and
   restart commands  to fail when running iptables-restore.

 * Previously, if a provider and its interface had the same name,
   then the 'enable' command would not work on that interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 10 20:11:40 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.9.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * Previously, using a wildcard interface name in a rule would
    result in this error:

       ERROR: Invalid ipset name (ppp+) : ...

    Such entries are now handled correctly.
  * The shorewall-masq(5) manpage incorrectly stated that the
    SOURCE column may use exclusion with an interface name (e.g.,
    eth1:!1.2.3.4). That hasn't been the case for some time. To
    accomplish the same thing, do this:

        eth0    1.2.3.4   NONAT
        eth0    eth1

     Note: Using an interface name in the SOURCE column is deprecated.
  * Previously, if a MARK was specified for a tc class that
    explicitly specified a class number, the following spurious
    warning message was issued:

       WARNING: Class NUMBER ignored --
                INTERFACE <name> does not have the 'classify' option

    That warning message is no longer issued.
  * With Shorewall 4.5.9, there were issues when the ipset utility
    was not installed, some of which prevented Shorewall from
    starting.
- Adjust for the usr move
  * change /sbin/service to /usr/service in requires and setting links


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 08:20:38 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.9 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release contains all defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.8.2.

  * A typo has been corrected in the shorewallrc.default file.

  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.7.2, Shorewall unconditionally
    restores the provider mark as the first rule in the mangle
    table OUTPUT and PREROUTING chains. Previously, the provider
    mark was restored only if it was non-zero.

    It has become clear that some users need it one way while
    others need it the other way. To resolve this issue, a
    RESTORE_ROUTEMARKS option has been added to shorewall.conf and
    shorewall6.conf. When this option is set to Yes (the default),
    the 4.5.7.2 approach is used (always restore the mark, even if
    it is zero); when it is set to No, the pre-4.5.7.2 behavior is
    retained (only restore the mark if it is non-zero).

  * Two error messages produced by the RST action have been
    corrected. They previously referred to errors in the NotSyn
    action rather than RST.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 10 21:11:39 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.8.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The 'shorewall show' command previously produced no output.
    That command now works with ipset versions 4 and later.

  * The change in 4.5.8.1 that enabled industry-standard IPv4
    address representation broke the ability to place IP ranges or
    IPv6 ipsets in the hosts file. Those abilities have been
    restored.

  * The treatment of the SYSTEMD and INITFILE shorewallrc variables
    has been inconsistent. The -lite installers ignore INITFILE
    when SYSTEMD is specified, while the other installers do not.
    Now, the -lite installers install the .service file if SYSTEMD
    is specified and they install the sysv-init script if INITFILE
    is specified. That is consistent with the behavior of the other
    installers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  7 05:02:00 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.8.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * When ipset version 5 or later was installed, the 'shorewall show
    dynamic <zone>' command produced no outout and the 'add' command
    failed with this error message:

        Zone <zone>, interface <interface> does not have a dynamic
        host list"

  * When generating ipset names for dynamic zones, the compiler was
    dropping dashes ('-') from the interface name and adding a unique
    suffix. For example the ipset for zone 'foo' and interface 'bar-if'
    might be 'foo_barif_1'. Dashes are now retained so that the
    generated set name in this example will be 'foo_bar-if'. This change
    also allows the 'add' and 'delete' commands to work correctly when
    the interface name contains one or more dashes.

    Although dash is documented as being an accepted character in ipset
    names, names containing a dash would generate an error in some
    contexts. That has also been corrected.

  * In most contexts, Shorewall6 has required IPv6 addresses to be
    enclosed in either angled brackets ( <....> , deprecated) or in
    square brackets ([....]). This includes network addresses, where
    both the IPv6 address and the VLSM are required to be within the
    brackets (e.g., [2001;470:b:787::/64]). This differs from the
    industry-standard network form in which the IPv6 address is enclosed
    in square brackets and the VLSM is outside of the brackets (e.g.,
    [2001:470:b:787::]/64). Beginning with this release, the
    industry-standard representation is also accepted by Shorewall6.

    Note: Those of you who read the patches will probably have noticed
    that much of this change was actually in 4.5.8; because the change
    was commited late in the 4.5.8 release cycle, we chose not to
    document the change until it had undergone additional testing.

-  Added 0001-remote_fs.patch for shorewall-init sysv-init scripts
   rebased patches to -p1 level
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  5 08:42:35 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.8 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes the defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.7.1.

  * The restriction that TTL and HL rules could only be placed in
    the FORWARD chain prevented these rules from being used to hide
    a router from traceroute[6]. It is now allowed to place these
    rules in the PREROUTING chain by following the specification
    with ':P' (e.g., 'TTL(+1):P').

  * Previously, the macro.SNMP macro opened both UDP ports 161 and
    162 from SOURCE to DEST. This is against the usual practice of
    opening these ports in the opposite direction. Beginning with
    this release, port 162 is opened in to SOURCE to DEST as
    before, while port 161 is opened from DEST to SOURCE.

  * Previously, when compiling for export, both
    /etc/shorewall/shorewall[6].conf and the shorewall[6].conf in
    the configuration directory were processed. Now, only the copy
    in the configuration directory is processed.

  * The 'iptables_raw' module has been added to the
    modules.essential file.

  * Several corrections have been made to the Fedora/Redhat init
    script for Shorewall-init.

  * The <directory> parameter to the 'try' command is now
    documented in the shorewall(8) and shorewall6(8) manpages.

  * Some redundant interface-option rules have been removed in
    configurations with multiple zones configured on a single
    interface.

  * Previously, when compiling for export, the compilation would
    fail if the setting of SHAREDIR in the firewall's shorewallrc
    was different from the setting on the admin system. Such
    compilations now succeed.

- For openSUSE 12.3 provide only systemd and drop sysv-init scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 09:17:06 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Since shorewall executables are in /usr/sbin systemd service
  files now reflect the correct location

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  3 06:32:01 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.7.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * When using IPSEC in a multi-ISP configuration, it is possible
    for the kernel to mis-route ESP packets. To date, this problem
    has only been observed on a system running a 3.5 kernel where
    traffic is being tunneled through GRE which is in turn being
    tunneled via IPSEC.

    This Shorewall release includes a low-cost workaround.

  * The Netfilter team have announced their intention to remove the
    NOTRACK target in favor of 'CT --notrack'. Shorewall will now
    map  NOTRACK to 'CT --notrack' if the CT Target is available.

  * Previously, the current COMMENT was not being cleared after the
    blrules file was processed, causing that COMMENT to be used on
    entries in the rules file. That defect has been corrected.

- Add a note to the spec for reviewer explaining the configure
  command usage

- Removed following opensuse specific patches as they are merged to
  upstream now
   + shorewall-lite-4.5.2-init.patch
   + shorewall6-4.5.2-init.patch
   + shorewall6-lite-4.5.2-init.patch
   + shorewall-init-4.4.21_init_sh.patch
- Added 001-required-stop-fix patch for shorewall-lite/init.suse.sh
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 21 06:07:04 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.7 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes the defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.6.2.

  * The command 'shorewall enable pppX' could fail with the ip
    diagnostic Error: either "to" is duplicate, or "weight" is a
    garbage.

     Shorewall now generates the correct ip command.

  * Optimize level 4 could previously combine two rules that each
    specified the 'policy' match, leading to this iptables-restore
    failure:

        policy match: multiple elements but no --strict

     The optimizer now avoids combining such rules.

     While this is a long-standing defect in the optimizer, it was
     exposed by changes in Shorewall 4.5.6.

   * There were several cases where hard-wired directory names
     appeared in the tarball installers. These have been replaced
     with the appropriate shorewallrc variables.

   * A defect in RHEL 6.3 and derivatives causes 'shorewall show
     capabilities' to leave an empty ipset in the configuration. The
     same defect can cause the Shorewall compiler to similarly leave
     an empty ipset behind.

     This Shorewall release has a workaround for this problem.

-  Added Bash >= 4 to BuildRequires
-  Fix builds for Fedora


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 21:14:50 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.6.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * The compiler now generates an error when a SOURCE interface is
    specified in a rule where the SOURCE zone is the firewall
    itself.
  * Previously, entries in /etc/shorewall/notrack that specified a
    Vserver zone in the SOURCE column were omitted from the
    generated  ruleset.
  * The set of helpers available in the notrack file and in the
    HELPER column of the tcrules file was incorrect:
     - The Amanda helper requires a UDP port -- Shorewall was
       requiring
       TCP.
     - The H323 module supplies two helpers: 'RAW' and 'Q.931';
       Shorewall only accepted 'h323'.
     - The Netbios NS module supplies the 'netbios-ns' helper;
       Shorewall
       only accepted 'netbios_ns'.
  * The conditional directive '?IF 0' generated an error from the
    compiler. It now causes following lines to be omitted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 10 08:02:07 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.6 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release includes the defect repairs from Shorewall 4.5.5.1
     through 4.5.5.4.
  * Previously, the tcrules file was not processed when
    TC_ENABLED=No. That meant that to use features like TPROXY, it
    was  necessary to set TC_ENABLED=Yes and create a dummy
    /etc/shorewall/tcstart file. Now, only MANGLE_ENABLED=Yes is
    required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  1 11:24:54 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.5.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When logical interface names were used, an entry in tcrules
    that included a classid could result in the compiler failing with
    this Perl diagnostic:

      Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Tc.pm line nnn, <$currentfile>
      line 20.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 14:25:19 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.5.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The change in Shorewall 4.5.4 that cleared the 'default' table
    if there were no 'fallback' providers broke multiple 'fallback'
    providers that don't supply a weight. The symptoms were that
    there were host routes to the default gateways in the 'default'
    routing table but no default routes through those gateways.

    This has now been corrected and multiple 'fallback' routes are
    once again supported.

   * When a logical device name was specified in the REDIRECTED
     INTERFACES column of /etc/shorewall/tcdevices, that name was
     used in the generated script rather than the devices's physical
     name. Unless the two were the same, this caused start/restart
     failure. Shorewall now uses the physical name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  9 22:21:56 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.5 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasnotes.txt

  * This release includes all defect repair from Shorewall 4.5.4.1
     and 4.5.4.2.

  * The Shorewall compiler sometimes must defer generating a rule
    until runtime. This is done by placing shell commands in its
    internal representation of a chain. These commands are then
    executed at run time to create the final rule.

    If all of the following were true, then an incorrect ruleset
    could be generated:

    + Optimization level 4 was set.
    + A chain (chain A) containing shell commands had three or
      fewer rules and commands.
    + The last rule in a second chain was a conditional jump to
     chain A.

     Under these conditions, the rules and commands in Chain A

  * The Shorewall-core configure and configure.pl script were
    treating SYSCONFDIR as a synonym for CONFDIR making it
    impossible to set SYSCONFDIR.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  7 17:17:59 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.4.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The problems corrected section of the 4.5.4.1 release notes was
    missing the third problem corrected in the release. It has now
    been added.

  * A number of problems in Shorewall-init have been corrected:
     + If more than one product was listed in the PRODUCTS setting
       in /etc/default/shorewall-init (/etc/sysconfig/shorewall-init)
       then the second product would not be started/stopped.

     + Shorewall-init used 'restart' in response to an optional
       provider interface coming up. If the interface has been
       marked unusable (1 in the interface's .status file), then the
       'restart' would not enable the interface.

     + Shorewal-init produced a lot of clutter on the console
       during boot. You may now specify a LOGFILE in
       /etc/default/shorewall-init (/etc/sysconfig/shorewall-init)
       and all output produced by up and down events will be sent to
       that log. If no log is specified, this output is sent to
       /dev/null.

   * The order in which the compiler processes line-continuation
     (line ending in '\') and conditional-inclusion directives (?IF,
     ?ELSE, and ?ENDIF) has been reversed.

     Previously, the compiler built a concatenated line, then
     checked to see if the line began with ?IF, ?ELSE or ?ENDIF. Now, the
     compiler checks for ?IF, ?ELSE or ?ENDIF first and prevents
     those lines from becoming part of the concatenation.

   * Two issues with the shorecap programs have been corrected:

     + The Shorewall6-lite version failed to run with the message:

        /usr/share/shorewall6-lite/lib.cli: No such file or
        directory

     + The Shorewall-lite version would not run if SHAREDIR was
        set to a value other than /usr/share in shorewallrc.

   * The Shorewall 4.5.2.3 fix for the Shorewall-core installer's
     handling of --host=linux was not brought forward into 4.5.3.
     It has been included again in this version.

   * Single-line embedded PERL and SHELL commands have been
     re-enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  1 07:27:24 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.4.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.22, the 'pptpserver' tunnel type
    has been configured as a PPTP client running on the firewall
    rather than as a server on the firewall. It is now correctly
    configured as  a server.

  * The shorewall-accounting (5) and shorewall6-accounting (5)
    documentation for the IPSEC column is incorrect. Rather than
    'accountin' and 'accountout', the chain names should be
    'accipsecin' and 'accipsecout'.

  *  IPSEC accounting did not work if the accounting file was
     sectioned. Beginning with this release, the IPSEC column can
     be specified in any section. As always, the IPSEC column
     contains a comma-separated  list of items. In the FORWARD
     chain, the first (or only) item in the list must be either
     'in' or 'out' to indicate whether the rule  matches incoming
     packets that have been decrypted ('in') or outgoing packets
     that will be encrypted ('out'). There are no restrictions with
     respect to which chain IPSEC rules can appear in  a sectioned
     file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 26 14:18:26 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When EXPORTMODULES=No in shorewall.conf, the error messages
    have been eliminated

  * If the configuration settings in the PACKET MARK LAYOUT section
    of shorewall.conf (shorewall6.conf) had empty settings, the
    'update' command would previously set them to their default
    settings. It now  leaves them empty.

  * Previously, Shorewall used 'unreachable' routes to null-route
    the RFC1918 subnets. This approach has two drawbacks:

     - It can cause problems for IPSEC in that it can cause packets
       to be rejected rather than encrypted and forwarded.

     - It can return 'host unreachable' ICMPs to other systems that
       attempt to route RFC1918 addresses through the firewall.

     To eliminate these problems, Shorewall now uses 'blackhole'
     routes.
     Such routes don't interfere with IPSEC and silently drop
     packets  rather than return an ICMP.

  * The 'default' routing table is now cleared if there are no
     'fallback' providers.
  * Tproxy implementation has been reworked. For more details
    please consult the releasenotes.txt and changelog.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 15 22:40:55 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.3.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

 * Previously, nested conditionals did not work correctly in all
   cases. In particular:

     ?IF $FALSE
     ?IF $FALSE
              foo
             bar
         ?ENDIF
         baz
         bop
     ?ENDIF

    In this case, the lines 'baz' and 'bodyp' were incorrectly
    included when they should have beeen omitted.

  * The 'balance' routing table is now cleared if there are no
    'balance' providers.

  * Previously, the compiler generated an invalid 'ip add route'
    command if an IPv6 provider had '-' in the GATEWAY column.

  * As noted in the Migration Considerations, the generated
    firewall script maintains the interface .status files used by
    LSM and SWPING. Up to now, however, the 'disable' command did
    not update the .status file. That has been corrected. As part
    of the change, the 'isusable' script is no longer consulted by
    the'enable' command.

Fri May 11 07:03:29 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The LOCKFILE setting in shorewall.conf and shorewall6.conf had
    inadvertently become undocumented. It is now documented again.

  * In an initial installation of Shorewall, Shorewall6, Shorewall
    Lite or Shorewall6 Lite was done under Shorewall 4.5.2, then the
    firewall would not start up at boot even though the installer
    indicated that it would. That defect has been corrected.

  * Previously, when per-IP rate limiting was invoked, the compiler
    would use the deprecated '--ratelimit' option, even if the
    preferred '--ratelimit-upto' option was available. Now, the
    compiler uses the preferred option if it is supported by the
    installed version of iptables.

  * Prior to this release, using a manual chain in the ACTION
    column of a macro body generated an error:

    ERROR: Invalid Action (mychain) in macro, macro.FOO (line ...)

    This now works correctly and generates a jump to the specified
    manual chain.

  * Previously, a line with the single word COMMENT in the tunnels
    file would generate the following error:

        ERROR: Zone must be specified

    Now, such a line correctly resets the current rule comment.

  * In Shorewall 4.5.2, the MARK column in the tcrules file was
    renamed to ACTION but only 'mark' was accepted in the alternate
    specification format. Now both 'mark' and 'action' are
    accepted.

  * The alternative method of provider balancing using the
    statistic match feature of iptables/Netfilter was missing some
    logic, with the result that it was ineffective.

  * If a logical interface name was used by itself in the SOURCE
    column of the rtrules file, the generated routing rule would
    contain the logical name rather than the physical name.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 06:19:41 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.2.4 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * The 'shorewall reset' command now correctly resets the IPv4
    packet and byte counters; previously, it was resetting the IPv6
    counters.

  * The Shorewall installer now modifies the Chains.pm file for
    Digest::SHA depencency when $DESTDIR is set, provided that
    $BUILD = $HOST. This allows rpm to automatically generate the correct
    module dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 15 09:00:27 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.2.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * If a shorewallrc file is passed to the 4.5.2.1 Shorewall-core
    install.sh, subsequent compilations fail. The error message
    indicates that the compiler is looking for lib.core, but the
    pathname has embedded spaces.

  * The 4.5.2.1 Shorewall/Shorewall6 installer installs an
    incorrect file as /etc/shorewall[6]/Makefile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 19:27:13 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.2.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * In release 4.5.2, if an INCLUDE directive appeared inside a ?IF
    ... ?ENDIF sequence, then the following error would be
    generated after the included file had been read:

          ERROR: Missing ?ENDIF to match the ?IF at line ...
  * An error in the shorewallrc.apple file has been corrected.
  * The shorewallrc.redhat file has been change to conform to
    Fedora packaging guidelines.
  * The output of the 'version -a' command reflected incorrect
    versions when Shorewall-core 4.5.2 was installed. That has been
    corrected.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 13 13:58:52 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * The generated firewall script includes code to automatically
    create ipsets that are referenced but that don't exist. That code
    was broken in releases 4.4.22 and later. This defect has been
    corrected. As part of the fix, the generated script will now
    issue a warning message when it creates an ipset.
  * The 'mss' option is now supported in the /etc/shorewall[6]/hosts
    files. See the manpages for details.
  * It is now possible to conditionally include or omit
    configuration entries based on the settings of shell variables.
    See  http://www.shorewall.net/configuration_file_basics.htm
    for details.
  * The MARK/CLASSIFY column in /etc/shorewall[6]/tcrules has been
    renamed ACTION to reflect the expanded set of actions that can
    be specified in the column.
  * Some users are finding these ipset warnings objectionable:
    + Warning when a referenced ipset does not exist.
    + Warning when using [src] in a destination column or [dst] in
      a source column.
    These warnings may now be suppressed by setting
    IPSET_WARNINGS=No  in shorewall.conf and/or shorewall6.conf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 20 07:38:46 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.1.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * When checking or compiling for export (-e option),
    /sbin/shorewall would previously issue a warning message if
    the SHOREWALL_SHELL specified in the remote
    firewall's shorewall.conf did not exist.

  * The changes to TOS handling in 4.5.1 are incompatible with
    older releases such as RHEL5 and derivatives. That has been
    corrected.

  * The rules compiler now verifies that the protocol is TCP, UDP,
    SCTP or DCCP when checking a port range (low:high or low-high).

  * Previously, start or restart using the init script would fail
    with an error message referencing 'SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT'.
    This defect was not visible to users that set AUTOMAKE=Yes or
    that run Shorewall-init.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 16 06:36:10 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release includes all defect repair from versions
    4.5.0.1-4.5.0.3.
  * A typo has been corrected in the blrules man pages.
  * Previously, if the interface appearing in the HOSTS column of
    /etc/shorewall6/hosts was not defined in
    /etc/shorewall6/interfaces, then the compiler would terminate
    with a Perl diagnostic:

      Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Zones.pm line 1817,
      <$currentfile> line ...
  * The compiler was previously failing to validate the contents of
    the LENGTH and TOS columns in /etc/shorewall/tcrules. The
    contents of those columns are now validated by the compiler and
    an appropriate  error message is issued if validation fails.
  * The column headings in the tos files are now in the proper
    order. Previously, the SOURCE PORT and DEST PORT columns were
    reversed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 26 13:11:01 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.1-Beta2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  *  A typo has been corrected in the blrules man pages.
     Previously, if the interface appearing in the HOSTS column of
    /etc/shorewall6/hosts was not defined in
    /etc/shorewall6/interfaces, then the compiler would terminate
    with  a Perl diagnostic:

      Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at
      /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Zones.pm line 1817,
      <$currentfile> line ...



-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 22 18:34:14 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.5.1-Beta For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * The packing of the Shorewall products has been changed. Beginning
    with this release, the packages are:

    + Shorewall Core  -- Core libraries installed in
                       /usr/share/shorewall/

    + Shorewall       -- Requires Shorewall Core. Together with
                         Shorewall Core, provides IPv4 firewalling.

    + Shorewall6      -- Requires Shorewall. Provides IPv6
      firewalling.

    + Shorewall Lite  -- Requires Shorewall Core. As before.

    + Shorewall6 Lite -- Requires Shorewall Core. As before.

    + Shorewall Init  -- As before

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 21 14:27:48 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.27.3 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Previously, if USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes and 'loose' was specified on
    all providers, then no routing rule targeting the main routing
    table was generated. This has been corrected so that
    USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes always results in such a rule at
     priority 999.

   * Shorewall 4.4.27 broke Shorewall-init functionality. It is
     restored in this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 16 14:13:20 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.27.2. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * A long-standing problem with Shorewall's 'save' facility has
    been discovered. The defect can cause rules to be dropped during
    'save' so that they are not available to be reapplied during
    'restore'. This can occur in 'safe-restart' when the prompt is
    not acknowledged or when it is acknowledged with 'n'.

    The problem can occur when:

    a)  There are IPSEC zones or hosts present; and
    b)  GOTO Target support is available in the kernel and
        iptables.

    Example of rule that will be dropped:

      -A eth2_fwd -m policy --dir in --pol ipsec -g AAA_frwd

    The defective code has been corrected so that rules are no
    longer dropped.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 19:33:16 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.27.1. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * When optimization category 4 is used, unconditional jumps at
    the end of chains are replaced with the rules in the target
    chain. This can result in rulesets that are considerably larger
    than necessary. Beginning with this release, replacement will
    only occur if:

    a) The jump is the only reference to the target chain; or
    b) The target chain contains 3 or less rules.

  * The feature introduced in 4.4.25 that allowed provider names in
    the  'enable' and 'disable' commands was only implemented for
    'enable'. It is now implemented for 'disable' as well.

  * When detecting IPv6 global addresses through an interface,
    Shorewall6-generated scripts were ignoring addresses beginning
    with '3'.

  * A typo in /usr/share/shorewall/prog.header caused an 'awk' script
    to fail when saving a multi-hop default route during 'start'.

  * The value '0' is once again accepted in the IN_BANDWIDTH
    columns of tcinterfaces and tcrules, and causes no ingress
    policing to be configured.

  * MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=Yes no longer generates an error when
    $FW:<address> is entered in the SOURCE column of the tcrules
    file.

  * In most Shorewall 4.4 versions, if an exported params file
    (EXPORTPARAMS=Yes in shorewall.conf) generates any output to
    stdout, then the following messages would appear during
    start/restart:

      Compiling /etc/shorewall/routestopped...
      Shorewall configuration compiled to
      /var/lib/shorewall/.restart
      printf: 214: Build: expected numeric value
      printf: 214: ipset: expected numeric value
      printf: 214: of: expected numeric value
      Processing /etc/shorewall/params ...
      Build ipset of blacklisted addresses
      Usage: /var/lib/shorewall/.restart [ options ] <command>

         <command> is one of:
     start
     stop
     ...

    This has now been corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 14 09:05:51 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.26.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

 * The Perl module version numbers have now been updated to
   reflect changes in 4.4.26.
 * The 4.4.26 rules compiler does not issue a warning when a
   capabilities file was generated with Shorewall 4.4.25, even
   though new capabilities were added in 4.4.26. This has been
   corrected so that a warning is generated.
 * When TC_ENABLED=Shared, CLASSIFY rules could not be used in the
   tcrules file. Thanks to a patch from Chris Boot, this now works
   as expected.
 * The quoted part of the progress message 'Provider "..."
   compiled' was inadvertently omitted by a change in Shorewall 4.4.23.
   That text has now been restored.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  3 10:23:47 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.26 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
  * This release includes all corrections included in 4.4.25.1
    through .3.
  * In 4.4.25, ACCEPT behaved in the BLACKLIST section the same way
    as in the other rules file sections. This could lead to
    connections  being accepted inadvertently.

    Now, ACCEPT behaves like WHITELIST; that is, it exempts the
    packet from the remaining rules in the BLACKLIST section.
  * Previously, Shorewall did not detect the ULOG and NFLOG
    capabilities. This lead to run-time failures during 'start' and
    'restart' as well as confusing error messages during
    compilation  when ULOG or NFLOG was used when the LOG target was
    not available.

    ULOG and NFLOG are now detected capabilities so, if you use a
    capabilities file, you will need to regenerate it in order to
    use these log levels.
  * The SAME tcrules target was broken in Shorewall 4.4.22. It now
    works correctly again.
  * Previously, 'shorewall6 update' did not update shorewall6.conf.
    The command now works as expected.
  * In earlier releases, the compiler was attempting to process the
    params file before it was aware of the setting of CONFIG_PATH.
    This could cause the params file to be missed if it was not located
    in /etc/shorewall[6] or in the directory named in the start
    (restart,compile,check,...) command.

    Now, /sbin/shorewall[6] passes $CONFIG_PATH to the compiler
    (/usr/share/shorewall/compiler.pl) in the new '--config_path'
    option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 12 08:39:06 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.25.3  For more details see changelog.txt and
   releasenotes.txt
  * Correction of the produced ruleset when wildchars are used in
    the zone configuration

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  6 10:05:33 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

-  Update to 4.4.25.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
   releasenotes.txt

   * Previously, if all the following were true:

    - AUTOMAKE=Yes
    - Current compiled script (/var/lib/shorewall/firewall or
      /var/lib/shorewall6/firewall) up to date
    - LEGACY_FASTSTART=No
    - There was a saved configuration

    then rather than start the current configuration, 'shorewall
    start -f' or 'shorewall6 start -f' would incorrectly restore
    the saved  configuration.

    * The DropSmurfs and TCPFlags actions are now available in
    Shorewall6. They were previously omitted from the IPv6
    actions.std file.

    * The 'rawpost' table was previously omitted from the output of
    the 'dump' command. It is now displayed.

    * Previously, if a configuration contained more than one wildcard
    interface (physical name ending in '+'), then the generated script
    might not work properly with Shorewall-init. This defect dates back
    to the introduction of Shorewall-init.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  1 18:16:52 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.25.1 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * A'refresh' command with no chains or tables specified will
    now reload chains created by entries in the BLACKLIST section of
    the rules file.
  * The rules compiler previously failed to detect the 'Flow
    Filter' capability. That capability is now correctly detected.
  * The IN_BANDWIDTH handling changes in 4.4.25 was incompatible
    with moribund distributions such as RHEL4. Restoring IN_BANDWIDTH
    functionality on those releases required a new 'Basic Filter'
    capability.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 30 09:47:11 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.25 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

 * A defect in the optimizer that allowed incompatible rules to be
   combined has been corrected.
 * Routes and rules added as a result of entries in
   /etc/shorewall6/providers were previously not deleted by
   'stop' or 'restart'. Repeated 'restart' commands could
   therefore  lead to an incorrect routing configuration.
 * Previously, capital letters were disallowed in IPv6 addresses.
   They are now permitted.
 * If the COPY column in /etc/shorewall6/providers was non-empty,
   previously a run-time error could occur when copying a table.
   The diagnostic produced by ip was:

       Either "to" is duplicate, or "cache" is garbage

 * When copying IPv6 routes, the generated script previously
   attempted to copy 'cache' entries. Those entries are now omitted.
 * Previously, the use of large provider numbers could cause some
   Shorewall-generated routing rules to be ineffective.
 * In some contexts, IPv6 addresses of the form ::i.j.k.l were
   incorrectly classified as invalid by the configuration compile
 * New blacklisting facility implemented. For this and other new
   features please refer to the releasenotes.txt


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 16:58:32 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.24.1

  * When the logical and physical name of an interface were
    different, including the logical name in the tcdevices file
    caused the device's classes to be ignored. This defect was
    introduced in  Shorewall 4.4.23.

  * Remove the ExecReload from all services, since systemd
    doesn't allow an ExecReload for OneShot services. Also, add a
    missing After=network.target to shorewall.service.

- Fixed Url typo in the spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 10 07:17:47 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.24. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * This release includes all problem corrections from releases
    4.4.23.1-4.4.23.3.

  * The 'fallback' option without =<weight> previously produced
    invalid  'ip' commands.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 14:56:11 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- reworked systemd related rpm macros for 12.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 11:20:49 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.23.3
  * When providers were present that specify neither 'balance' nor
    'fallback', then the following message was issued during
    compilation and 'enable' of the interface would fail.

    Use of uninitialized value $weight in concatenation (.) or
    string  at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Providers.pm line 644.

  * TC_ENABLED=Shared was broken in Shorewall 4.4.23, 4.4.23.1 and
    4.4.23.2. It produced a  shell script with syntax errors.
- Backported patches removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 15:06:03 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.23.2  For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt
- Support of systemd for openSUSE 12.1
- Backported patches WEIGHT.patch and SHARED.patch fixing a
  harmless message and traffic shaping issues respectively

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 18:47:26 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.22.3. Corrections in this release are below.
  * On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', harmless
    Perl diagnostics like the following could be issued:

        Use of uninitialized value $list in pattern match (m//)
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1273,
        <$currentfile> line 14.

        Use of uninitialized value $list in split
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1275,
        <$currentfile> line 14.

  * On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Mangle FORWARD Chain: Not Available', entries in the
    ecn file generated the following Perl Diagnostic:

        Use of uninitialized value in hash element
    at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 1119.

  * Previously, if a provider interface was derived from an optional
    wildcard entry in /etc/shorewall/providers, then the interface
    was never considered to be usable.

    Example:

    /etc/shorewall/interfaces:

    #ZONE    INTERFACE   BROADCAST    OPTIONS
      net ppp+     -  optionsl

    /etc/shorewall/providers:net
    #PROVIDER  NUMBER  MARK  INTERFACE ...
     ISP1   1   1 ppp0

  * When 'shorewall update' or 'shorewall6 update' results in no change
    to the .conf file, a message is issued, the .bak file is removed
    and the command terminates without error.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 08:28:00 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

-  patch the Perl diagnostic with a WARNING  message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  9 19:22:07 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.22.2

  * On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', Shorewall
    4.4.22 and 4.4.22.1 generated invalid iptables-restore input.

  * Previously, the compiler always placed '#!/bin/sh' on the first
    line of the generated script. It now uses the setting of
    SHOREWALL_SHELL on that line rather than '/bin/sh'. Note that
    SHOREWALL_SHELL defaults to '/bin/sh' so this change only affects
    those who specify a different shell.

- Patched REDIRECT rule

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  4 05:13:07 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.22.1

  * Previously, if the name of a zone began with 'all', then entries
    for that zone in /etc/shorewall/rules and /etc/shoreawll6/rules
    treated the name the same as 'all'.

    This defect is present in Shorewall 4.4.13 through 4.4.22.

 *  Previously, when LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=No, harmless
    iptables-restore  warnings as follows could be generated:

        ...
      Running   /usr/local/sbin/iptables-restore...
     --set option deprecated, please use --match-set
     --set option deprecated, please use --match-set
      IPv4 Forwarding Enabled


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  3 15:45:01 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.22. For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * Under rare conditions, long port lists (>15 ports) could result in
  the following failure when optimization level 4 was enabled.

       Use of uninitialized value in numeric gt (>)
       at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 1264.

       ERROR: Internal error in
       Shorewall::Chains::decrement_reference_count at
       /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 1264

  * All corrections included in Shorewall 4.4.21.1.

- A bug in recent versions of Shorewall that could result in rules
  that are  wider in scope than intended was fixed by applying a patch
  by the upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 19 22:06:11 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.21.1 Changes in this release are:

  * A harmless Perl run-time "uninitialized variable" diagnostic has
  been eliminated from the compiler. The diagnostic was issued while
  displaying the capabilities.

  * As the result of a typo, an orphan filter chain named FORWAR
  could be created under rare circumstances. This chain was deleted
  by OPTIMIZE level 4.

  * The SNAT options --persistent and --randomize now work properly
  (/etc/shorewall/masq).

  * The LOGMARK log level was previously generated invalid iptables
  input making it unusable. That has been corrected.

 The syntax for LOGMARK is now:

 LOGMARK(<priority>) where <priority> is a syslog priority (1-7 or debug,
 info, notice,  etc.).

 Example rule:
    #ACTION           SOURCE  DEST   PROTO   DEST
    #                        PORT(S)
    LOG:LOGMARK(info)  lan    dmz    udp     1234


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 08:13:36 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.21 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

 * The Shorewall and Shorewall6 'load' and 'reload' commands
   now use the .conf file in the current working directory.
 * The 'balance' and 'fallback' options in /etc/shorewall/providers
   have always been mutually exclusive but the compiler previously
   didn't enforce that restriction. Now it does.
 * The ipset modules are now automatically loaded by Shorewall6 when
   LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=No is specified in shorewall6.conf. Additionally,
   there is now a /usr/share/shorewall6/modules.ipset file that
   lists  all of the required modules.
 * TPROXY descriptions have been added to shorewall-tcrules(5) and
   shorewall6-tcrules(5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 16 06:59:20 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.20.3. Changes in this release are
 * Deprecated options have been removed from the .conf files.
   They remain in the man pages.
 * A simple configuration like the 'Universal' sample that includes a
   single wildcard interface ('+' in the INTERFACE column) produces a
   ruleset that blocks all incoming packets.

   As part of correcting this defect, which was introduced in
   4.4.20.2, one or more superfluous rules (which could never
   match) have been eliminated from most configurations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 06:57:32 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.20.2
  * A defect introduced in 4.4.20 could cause the following failure at
    start/restart:

    ERROR: Command "tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1:11 handle 1:
           sfq quantum 12498 limit 127 perturb 10" failed
  * The 'sfilter' interface option introduced in 4.4.20 was only
    applied to forwarded traffic. Now it is also applied to traffic
    addressed to the firewall itself.
  * Issues with iptables-restore is corrected
  * IPSEC traffic is now (correctly) excluded from sfilter.
  * The following incorrect warning message has been eliminated:

     WARNING: sfilter is ineffective with FASTACCEPT=Yes


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 14:14:12 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.20.1
  * The address of the Free Software Foundation has been corrected in
  the License files.
  * The shorewall[6].conf file installed in
    /usr/share/shorewall[6]/configfiles is no longer modified for use
    with Shorewall[6]-lite. When creating a new configuration for a
    remote forewall, two lines need to be modified in the copy

           CONFIG_PATH=/usr/share/shorewall (or shorewall6)
       STARTUP_LOG=/var/log/shorewall-lite-init.log
                   (or shorewall6-lite-init.log)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  6 07:30:14 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.20
  *Removed backported patches for openSUSE specific locations as
  they are incorporated in upstream.

- Changes in 4.4.20 (for more read changelog.txt and releasenotes.txt)
  * Support for the AUDIT target has been added. AUDIT is a feature of
  the 2.6.39 kernel and iptables 1.4.10 that allows security auditing
  of access decisions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 18 11:03:16 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.19.4
 * Previously, the compiler would allow a degenerate entry (only the
   BAND specified) in /etc/shorewall/tcpri. Such an entry now raises a
   compilation error.
 * Previously, it was possible to specify tcfilters and tcrules that
   classified traffic with the class-id of a non-leaf HFSC class. Such
   classes are not capabable of handling packets.
   Shorewall now generates a compile-time warning in this case and
   ignores the entry.

   If a non-leaf class is specified as the default class, then
   Shorewall now generates a compile-time error since that
   configuration allows no network traffic to flow.

 * Traditionally, Shorewall has not checked for the existance of
   ipsets mentioned in the configuration, potentially resulting in a
   run-time start/restart failure. Now, the compiler will issue a
   WARNING if:

   a) The compiler is being run by root.
   b) The compilation isn't producing a script to run on a remote
   system under a -lite product.
   c) An ipset appearing in the configuration does not exist on the
   local system.

* As previously implemented, the 'refresh' command could fail or
  could result in a ruleset other than what was intended. If there
  had been changes in the ruleset since it was originally
  started/restarted/restored that added or deleted sequenced chains
  (chains such as ~lognnn and ~exclnnn), the resulting ruleset could
  jump to the wrong such chains or could fail to 'refresh'
  successfully.

  This issue has been corrected as follows. When a 'refresh' is done
  and individual chains are involved, then each table that contains
  both sequenced chains and one of the chains being refreshed is
  refreshed in its entirety.

  For example, if 'shorwall refresh foo' is issued and the filter
  table (which is the default) contains any sequenced chains, then
  the entire table is reloaded. Note that this reload operation is
  atomic so no packets are passed through an inconsistent
  configuration.

 * When 'shorewall6 refresh' was run previously, a harmless
   'ip6tables: Chain exists' message was generated.

- Reworked backported patches so shorewall still uses openSUSE specific
  locations
- Fix the zone definitions in shorewall6/Samples6/zones examples

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 11 16:17:38 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.19.3
 * incompatibility with gawk has been corrected
 * Previously, an entry in the USER/GROUP column in the rules and
   tcrules files could cause run-time start/restart failures if the
   rule(s) being added did not have the firewall as the source (rules
   file) and were not being added to the POSTROUTING chain (:T
   designator in the tcrules file). This error is now caught by
   the compiler.
 * Shorewall now insures that a route to a default gateway exists in
   the main table before it attempts to add a default route through
   that gateway in a provider table. This prevents start/restart
   failures in the rare event that such a route does not exist.
 * CLASSIFY TC rules can apply to traffic exiting only the interface
   associated with the class-id specified in the first column.

 * Fixes start of shorewall6 (bnc#693162)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  6 08:03:49 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.19.2 For more details see changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt

  * In Shorewall-shell, there was the ability to specify IPSET names in
    the ORIGINAL DEST column of DNAT and REDIRECT rules. That ability,
    inadvertently dropped in Shorewall-perl, has been restored
  * Several problems with complex TC have been corrected:
  * Double exclusion involving ipset lists was previously not detected,
    resulting in anomalous behavior.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 18 09:42:37 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to 4.4.19.1
 * Eliminate silly duplicate rule when stopped.
 * Don't believe that all nexthop routes are default routes.
 * Restore :<low port>-<high port> in masq file.
 * Correct default route safe/restore.

- backported paths related patches from git as they are in mainstream
  now
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 13 17:23:31 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Shorewall packages have their openSUSE specific locations now

  * Executable files in /usr/lib/shorewall*. These include;

      getparams
      compiler.pl
      wait4ifup
      shorecap
      ifupdown

  * Perl Modules in /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/PERL_VERSION/Shorewall.

- Updated to 4.4.19 (for more info please consult changelog.txt and
  releasenotes.txt)

* Corrected a problem in optimize level 4 that resulted in the following
   compile-time failure
   Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at
     /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 862.

 * If a DNAT or REDIRECT rule applied to a source zone with an interface
   defined with 'physical=+', then the nat table 'dnat' chain might have
   been created but not referenced. This prevented the DNAT or REDIRECT
   rule from working correctly.

 * Previously, if a variable set in /etc/shorewall/params was given a value
   containing shell metacharacters, then the compiled script would contain
   syntax errors.

 * The pathname of the 'conntrack' binary was erroneously printed in the
   output of 'shorewall6 show connections'.

 * Correct a problem whereby incorrect Netfilter rules were generated when
   a bridge with ports was given a logical name.

 * If a bridge interface had subordinate ports defined in
   /etc/shorewall/interface, then an ipsec entry (either ipsec zone or the
   'ipsec' option specified) in /etc/shorewall/hosts resulted in the
   compiler generating an incorrect Netfilter configuration.

 * A fatal error is now raised if '!0' appears in the PROTO column of files
  that have that column. This avoids an iptables-restore failure at run time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  4 17:11:01 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 4.4.18.2
 * SAVE_IPSETS=Yes didn't work unless there is a dynamic zone defined.

 * If a logical name was given to a bridge and the ports on the bridge
   were defined in /etc/shorewall/interfac, then the compiler could
   generate matches that used the logical name rather than the
   physical name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 21 08:46:40 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 4.4.18.1
 * An issue with params processing on RHEL6 has been corrected. The
   problem manifested as the following type of warning:

    WARNING: Param line (export OLDPWD) ignored at
            /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 2993.

 * The editing of the value of the TC_PRIOMAP option has been
   tightened. Previously, many invalid settings were allowed,
   resulting in run-time tc command failures.

 * The Shorewall Lite and Shorewall6 Lite installers now install the
   'helpers' modules file. Previously, this file was not installed
   with the result that both 'shorewall[6]-lite show capabilities' and
   'shorecap' failed.

 * Previously, if an icmp or icmp6 type which included both a type and
   a code was used in the tcfilters file, 'start' and 'restart' would
   fail with a 'tc' error.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 11 23:46:49 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 4.4.18
  * for accounting modules xtables-addons must be installed

- Changes in 4.4.18 (for more read changelog.txt and releasenotes.txt)
  * The modules files are now just a driver that INCLUDEs several new
    files and one old file:
  * Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.18, the accounting structure can be
    created with three root chains:
     - accountin:  Rules that are valid in the INPUT chain (may not
       specify an output interface).
     - accountout: Rules that are valid in the OUTPUT chain (may not
       specify an input interface or a MAC address).
     - accountfwd: Other rules.
  * Internals Change: The Policy.pm module has been merged into the
     Rules.pm module.





-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 10 16:24:41 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 4.4.17
  * This release adds support for per-IP accounting using the ACCOUNT
    target. That target is only available when xtables-addons is
    installed.

- Changes in 4.4.17 (for more read changelog.txt and releasenotes.txt)

 *  Previously, Shorewall did not check the length of the names of
    accounting chains and manual chains. This could result in
    errors when loading the resulting ruleset. Now, the compiler issues
    an error for chain names longer than 29 characters.

    Additionally, the compiler now ensures that these chain names are
    composed only of letters, digits, underscores ('_') and dashes
    ("-"). This eliminates Perl runtime errors or other failures when a
    chain name is embedded within a regular expression.

 *  Several issues with complex traffic shaping have been resolved:

    a) Specifying IPv6 network addresses in the SOURCE or DEST columns
       of /etc/shorewall6/tcfilters now works correctly. Previously,
       Perl runtime warnings occurred and an invalid tc command was
       generated.

    b) Previously, if flow= was specified on a parent class, a perl
       runtime warning occurred and an invalid tc command was
       generated. This combination is now flagged as an error at
       compile time.

   c) There is now an ipv6 tcfilters skeleton included with
      Shorewall6.

 *  Several issues with accounting are corrected.

    a)  If an accounting rule of the form:

       chain1        chain2

       was configured and neither chain was referenced again in the
       configuration, then an internal error was generated when
       optimize level 4 was selected and OPTIMIZE_ACCOUNTING=Yes.

    b)  If there was only a single accounting rule and that rule
        specified an interface in the SOURCE or DEST columns, then the
    generated ruleset would fail to load when
        OPTIMIZE_ACCOUNTING=Yes.

    c)  If a per-IP accounting table name appeared in more than one
        rule and the specified network was not the same in all
    occurrences, then the generated ruleset would fail to load.
    This is now flagged as an error at compile time.

 *  Two defects in compiler module loading have been corrected:

    a) Previously, the kernel/net/ipv6/netfilter/ directory was not
       searched.
    b) A Perl diagnostic was issued when running on a monolithic kernel
       when the modutils package was installed.

 *  A line containing only 'INCLUDE' appearing in an extension script
    now generates a compile-time diagnostic rather than a run-time
    diagnostic.

 *  Previously, the uninstall.sh scripts used insserv (if installed) on
    Debian-based systems. These scripts now use the preferred tool
    (updaterc.d).

 *  Beginning with 4.4.16, compilation would fail if an empty shell
    variable was referenced in a config file on a system where /bin/sh
    is the Bourne Again Shell (bash).

 *  In earlier versions. if OPTIMIZE=8 then the ruleset displayed by
    'check -r' was the same as when OPTIMIZE=0 (unoptimized).
    Similarly, if OPTIMIZE=9 then the ruleset displayed was the same
    as when OPTIMIZE=1.

 *  Startup could previously fail on a system where kernel module
    autoloading was not available and where TC_ENABLED=Simple was
    specified in shorewall.conf or shorewall6.conf.

 *  Previously, a 'done.' message could be printed at the end of
    command processing even when the command had failed. Now, such a
    message only appears if the command completed successfully.



-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 22 19:00:26 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Updated to 4.4.16.1
  * Beginning with 4.4.16, compilation would fail if an empty shell
    variable was referenced in a config file on a system where /bin/sh
    is the Bourne Again Shell (bash).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 12 18:23:38 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- fix fillup for shorewall-init so it will be copied to sysconfig
  directory
- link network/scripts/shorewall to if-up.d and if-down.d

- Changes in 4.4.16 (for more read changelog.txt and releasenotes.txt)

+  If the output of 'env' contained a multi-line value, then
    compilation failed with an Internal Error. The code has been
    changed so that the compiler now handles multi-line values
    correctly.

 *  In 4.4.15, output to Standard Out (FD 1) generated by
    /etc/shorewall/params (/etc/shorewall6/params) was redirected to
    /dev/null. It is now redirected to Standard Error (FD 2).

 *  If a params file did not appear in the CONFIG_PATH, compilation
    failed with the error:
          .: 31: Can't open /etc/shorewall6/params
          ERROR: Processing of /etc/shorewall6/params failed

 *  Previously, proxy ARP with logical interface names did not
    work. Symptoms included numerous Perl runtime error messages.

 *  Previously, the root of a wildcard name erroneously matched that
    name. For example 'eth' matched 'eth+'. Now there must be at least
    one additional character (e.g., 'eth4').
 *  Use of logical interface names in the notrack and ecn files
    resulted in perl runtime warning messages.

 *  The use of wildcard-matching names in certain contexts would result
    in anomalous behavior. Among the symptoms were:

         - Perl run-time messages similar to this one:

       Use of uninitialized value in numeric comparison (<=>)
       at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Zones.pm line 1334.
          - Failure to treat the interface as optional or required.

 *  Where two ISPs share the same interface, if one of the ISPs was not
    reachable, an iptables-restore error such as this occurred:

         iptables-restore v1.4.10: Bad mac address "-j"

 * Previously, under very rare circumstances, a chain would be
    optimized away while there were still jumps to the chain. This caused
     Shorewall start/restart to fail during iptables-restore.

11) Previously, the setting of BLACKLIST_DISPOSITION was not
    validated. Now, an error is raised unless the value is DROP or REJECT.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  3 10:54:16 UTC 2011 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to version 4.4.15.3
- Changes in 4.4.15.3

  * Previously, the root of a wildcard name erroneously matched that
    name. For example 'eth' matched 'eth+'. Now there must be at least
    one additional character (e.g., 'eth4').

  * Use of logical interface names in the notrack and ecn files
    resulted in perl runtime warning messages.

  * The use of wildcard-matching names in certain contexts would result
    in perl run-time messages similar to this one:

    Use of uninitialized value in numeric comparison (<=>)
    at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Zones.pm line 1334.

  * Under very rare circumstances, a chain could be optimized away
    even when there are jumps to the chain. This resulted in a
    start/restart failure.

- Changes in 4.4.15.2

  * Previously, proxy ARP with logical interface names did not
    work. Symptoms included numerous Perl runtime error messages.

  * Previously, unknown interface names in the proxyarp and
    tcinterfaces files resulted in Perl runtime errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  2 20:49:39 UTC 2010 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Upgrade to version 4.4.15.1

- Changes in version 4.4.15.1

1)  If the output of 'env' contained a multi-line value, then
    compilation failed with an Internal Error. The code has been
    changed to ignore all but the first line of a multi-line value.

2)  If a params file did not appear in the CONFIG_PATH, compilation
    failed with the error:
       .: 31: Can't open /etc/shorewall6/params
       ERROR: Processing of /etc/shorewall6/params failed
