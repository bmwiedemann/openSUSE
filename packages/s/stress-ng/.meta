  <title>Tool to load and stress a computer</title>
  <description>stress-ng can stress various subsystems of a computer. It can stress load CPU,
cache, disk, memory, socket and pipe I/O, scheduling and much more. stress-ng
is a re-write of the original stress tool by Amos Waterland but has many
additional features such as specifying the number of bogo operations to run,
execution metrics, a stress verification on memory and compute operations and
considerably more stress mechanisms.
