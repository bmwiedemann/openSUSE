- Update to 1.9.12p1:
  * Changes in 1.9.12p1:
    - Sudo’s configure script now does a better job of detecting when
      the -fstack-clash-protection compiler option does not work.
      GitHub issue #191.

    - Fixed CVE-2022-43995, a potential out-of-bounds write for passwords
      smaller than 8 characters when passwd authentication is enabled.
      This does not affect configurations that use other authentication
      methods such as PAM, AIX authentication or BSD authentication.

    - Fixed a build error with some configurations compiling host_port.c.
  * Dropped sudo-CVE-2022-43995.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 22:07:14 UTC 2022 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.com>

- Added sudo-CVE-2022-43995.patch
  * CVE-2022-43995
  * bsc#1204986
  * Fixed a potential heap-based buffer over-read when entering a password
    of seven characters or fewer and using the crypt() password backend.

- Update to 1.9.12:
  * Dropped sudo-1.9.10-update_sudouser_to_utf8.patch
  * Changes in Sudo 1.9.12:
    * Fixed a bug when logging the command’s exit status in intercept mode.
      The wrong command could be logged with the exit status.
    * For ptrace-based intercept mode, sudo will now attempt to verify that
      the command path name, arguments and environment have not changed from
      the time when they were authorized by the security policy. The new
      intercept_verify sudoers setting can be used to control this behavior.
    * Fixed running commands with a relative path (e.g. ./foo) in intercept
      mode. Previously, this would fail if sudo’s current working directory
      was different from that of the command.
    * Sudo now supports passing the execve(2) system call the NULL pointer
      for the argv and/or envp arguments when in intercept mode. Linux treats
      a NULL pointer like an empty array.
    * The sudoers LDAP schema now allows sudoUser, sudoRunasUser and
      sudoRunasGroup to include UTF-8 characters, not just 7-bit ASCII.
    * Fixed a problem with sudo -i on SELinux when the target user’s home
      directory is not searchable by sudo. GitHub issue #160.
    * Neovim has been added to the list of visudo editors that support passing
      the line number on the command line.
    * Fixed a bug in sudo’s SHA384 and SHA512 message digest padding.
    * Added a new -N (no-update) command line option to sudo which can be used
      to prevent sudo from updating the user’s cached credentials. It is now
      possible to determine whether or not a user’s cached credentials are
      currently valid by running:
      $ sudo -Nnv
      and checking the exit value. One use case for this is to indicate in a
      shell prompt that sudo is “active” for the user.
    * PAM approval modules are no longer invoked when running sub-commands in
      intercept mode unless the intercept_authenticate option is set. There is
      a substantial performance penalty for calling into PAM for each command
      run. PAM approval modules are still called for the initial command.
    * Intercept mode on Linux now uses process_vm_readv(2) and process_vm_writev(2)
      if available.
    * The XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variable is now preserved by default.
      This makes it possible for graphical applications to choose the correct
      theme when run via sudo.
    * On 64-bit systems, if sudo fails to load a sudoers group plugin, it will
      use system-specific heuristics to try to locate a 64-bit version of the plugin.
    * The cvtsudoers manual now documents the JSON and CSV output formats.
      GitHub issue #172.
    * Fixed a bug where sub-commands were not being logged to a remote log server
      when log_subcmds was enabled. GitHub issue #174.
    * The new log_stdin, log_stdout, log_stderr, log_ttyin, and log_ttyout
      sudoers settings can be used to support more fine-grained I/O logging.
      The sudo front-end no longer allocates a pseudo-terminal when running a
      command if the I/O logging plugin requests logging of stdin, stdout, or
      stderr but not terminal input/output.
    * Quieted a libgcrypt run-time initialization warning. This fixes Debian
      bug #1019428 and Ubuntu bug #1397663.
    * Fixed a bug in visudo that caused literal backslashes to be removed from
      the EDITOR environment variable. GitHub issue #179.
    * The sudo Python plugin now implements the find_spec method instead of the
      the deprecated find_module. This fixes a test failure when a newer version
      of setuptools that doesn’t include find_module is found on the system.
    * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.9 where sudo_logsrvd created the process
      ID file, usually /var/run/sudo/sudo_logsrvd.pid, as a directory instead of a
      plain file. The same bug could result in I/O log directories that end in six
      or more X’s being created literally in addition to the name being used as a
      template for the mkdtemp(3) function.
    * Fixed a long-standing bug where a sudoers rule with a command line argument
      of “”, which indicates the command may be run with no arguments, would also
      match a literal "" on the command line. GitHub issue #182.
    * Added the -I option to visudo which only edits the main sudoers file. Include
      files are not edited unless a syntax error is found.
    * Fixed sudo -l -U otheruser output when the runas list is empty. Previously,
      sudo would list the invoking user instead of the list user. GitHub issue #183.
    * Fixed the display of command tags and options in sudo -l output when the RunAs
      user or group changes. A new line is started for RunAs changes which means we
      need to display the command tags and options again. GitHub issue #184.
    * The sesh helper program now uses getopt_long(3) to parse the command line options.
    * The embedded copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.13.
    * Fixed a bug that prevented event log data from being sent to the log server when
      I/O logging was not enabled. This only affected systems without PAM or
      configurations where the pam_session and pam_setcred options were disabled in
      the sudoers file.
    * Fixed a bug where sudo -l output included a carriage return after the newline.
      This is only needed when displaying to a terminal in raw mode. Bug #1042.

Sat Sep 10 01:48:29 UTC 2022 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.com>

- Modified sudo-sudoers.patch
  * bsc#1177578
  * Removed redundant and confusing 'secure_path' settings in
    sudo-sudoers file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 20 02:04:06 UTC 2022 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.11p3:
  * Changes in Sudo 1.9.11
    * Fixed a crash in the Python module with Python 3.9.10 on some systems.
      Additionally, make check now passes for Python 3.9.10.
    * Error messages sent via email now include more details, including the file
      name and the line number and column of the error. Multiple errors are sent in
      a single message. Previously, only the first error was included.
    * Fixed logging of parse errors in JSON format. Previously, the JSON logger would
      not write entries unless the command and runuser were set. These may not be
      known at the time a parse error is encountered.
    * Fixed a potential crash parsing sudoers lines larger than twice the value of
      LINE_MAX on systems that lack the getdelim() function.
    * The tests run by make check now unset the LANGUAGE environment variable.
      Otherwise, localization strings will not match if LANGUAGE is set to a
      non-English locale. Bug #1025.
    * The “starttime” test now passed when run under Debian faketime. Bug #1026.
    * The Kerberos authentication module now honors the custom password prompt if one
      has been specified.
    * The embedded copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.12.
    * Updated the version of libtool used by sudo to version 2.4.7.
    * Sudo now defines _TIME_BITS to 64 on systems that define __TIMESIZE in the
      header files (currently only GNU libc). This is required to allow the use of
      64-bit time values on some 32-bit systems.
    * Sudo’s intercept and log_subcmds options no longer force the command to run in
      its own pseudo-terminal. It is now also possible to intercept the system(3) function.
    * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd when run in store-first relay mode where the commit
      point messages sent by the server were incorrect if the command was suspended
      or received a window size change event.
    * Fixed a potential crash in sudo_logsrvd when the tls_dhparams configuration
      setting was used.
    * The intercept and log_subcmds functionality can now use ptrace(2) on Linux
      systems that support seccomp(2) filtering. This has the advantage of working
      for both static and dynamic binaries and can work with sudo’s SELinux RBAC mode.
      The following architectures are currently supported: i386, x86_64, aarch64, arm,
      mips (log_subcmds only), powerpc, riscv, and s390x. The default is to use
      ptrace(2) where possible; the new intercept_type sudoers setting can be used
      to explicitly set the type.
    * New Georgian translation from translationproject.org.
    * Fixed creating packages on CentOS Stream.
    * Fixed a bug in the intercept and log_subcmds support where the execve(2)
      wrapper was using the current environment instead of the passed environment
      pointer. Bug #1030.
    * Added AppArmor integration for Linux. A sudoers rule can now specify an
      APPARMOR_PROFILE option to run a command confined by the named AppArmor profile.
    * Fixed parsing of the server_log setting in sudo_logsrvd.conf. Non-paths were
      being treated as paths and an actual path was treated as an error.

  * Changes in Sudo 1.9.11p1:
    * Correctly handle EAGAIN in the I/O read/right events. This fixes a hang seen on
      some systems when piping a large amount of data through sudo, such as via rsync.
      Bug #963.
    * Changes to avoid implementation or unspecified behavior when bit shifting signed
      values in the protobuf library.
    * Fixed a compilation error on Linux/aarch64.
    * Fixed the configure check for seccomp(2) support on Linux.
    * Corrected the EBNF specification for tags in the sudoers manual page.
      GitHub issue #153.

  * Changes in Sudo 1.9.11p2:
    * Fixed a compilation error on Linux/x86_64 with the x32 ABI.
    * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.11p1 that caused a warning when logging to
      sudo_logsrvd if the command returned no output.

  * Changes in Sudo 1.9.11p3:
    * Fixed “connection reset” errors on AIX when running shell scripts with the intercept
      or log_subcmds sudoers options enabled. Bug #1034.
    * Fixed very slow execution of shell scripts when the intercept or log_subcmds sudoers
      options are set on systems that enable Nagle’s algorithm on the loopback device,
      such as AIX. Bug #1034.

  * Modified sudo-sudoers.patch

Thu Mar 24 08:18:58 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.10:
  * Added new log_passwords and passprompt_regex sudoers options. If
    log_passwords is disabled, sudo will attempt to prevent passwords from being
    logged. If sudo detects any of the regular expressions in the passprompt_regex
    list in the terminal output, sudo will log ‘*’ characters instead of the
    terminal input until a newline or carriage return is found in the input or an
    output character is received.
  * Added new log_passwords and passprompt_regex settings to sudo_logsrvd that
    operate like the sudoers options when logging terminal input.
  * Fixed several few bugs in the cvtsudoers utility when merging multiple sudoers
    sources.
  * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd parsing the sudo_logsrvd.conf file, where the
    retry_interval in the [relay] section was not being recognized.
  * Restored the pre-1.9.9 behavior of not performing authentication when sudo’s -n
    option is specified. A new noninteractive_auth sudoers option has been added to
    enable PAM authentication in non-interactive mode. GitHub issue #131.
  * On systems with /proc, if the /proc/self/stat (Linux) or /proc/pid/psinfo
    (other systems) file is missing or invalid, sudo will now check file
    descriptors 0-2 to determine the user’s terminal. Bug #1020.
  * Fixed a compilation problem on Debian kFreeBSD. Bug #1021.
  * Fixed a crash in sudo_logsrvd when running in relay mode if an alert message is
    received.
  * Fixed an issue that resulting in “problem with defaults entries” email to be
    sent if a user ran sudo when the sudoers entry in the nsswitch.conf file
    includes “sss” but no sudo provider is configured in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf.
  * Updated the warning displayed when the invoking user is not allowed to run
    sudo. If sudo has been configured to send mail on failed attempts (see the
    mail_* flags in sudoers), it will now print “This incident has been reported to
    the administrator.” If the mailto or mailerpath sudoers settings are disabled,
    the message will not be printed and no mail will be sent.
  * Fixed a bug where the user-specified command timeout was not being honored if
    the sudoers rule did not also specify a timeout.
  * Added support for using POSIX extended regular expressions in sudoers rules. A
    command and/or arguments in sudoers are treated as a regular expression if they
    start with a ‘^’ character and end with a ‘$’. The command and arguments are
    matched separately, either one (or both) may be a regular expression.
  * A user may now only run sudo -U otheruser -l if they have a “sudo ALL”
    privilege where the RunAs user contains either root or otheruser. Previously,
    having “sudo ALL” was sufficient, regardless of the RunAs user. GitHub issue
    #134.
  * The sudo lecture is now displayed immediately before the password prompt. As a
    result, sudo will no longer display the lecture unless the user needs to enter
    a password. Authentication methods that don’t interact with the user via a
    terminal do not trigger the lecture.
  * Sudo now uses its own closefrom() emulation on Linux systems. The glibc version
    may not work in a chroot jail where /proc is not available. If close_range(2)
    is present, it will be used in preference to /proc/self/fd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  1 02:27:04 UTC 2022 - Simon Lees <simonf.lees@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.9
   * Sudo can now be built with OpenSSL 3.0 without generating
     warnings about deprecated OpenSSL APIs.
   * A digest can now be specified along with the ALL command in
     the LDAP and SSSD back-ends. Sudo 1.9.0 introduced support for
     this in the sudoers file but did not include corresponding
     changes for the other back-ends.
   * visudo now only warns about an undefined alias or a cycle in
     an alias once for each alias.
   * The sudoRole cn was truncated by a single character in warning
     messages. GitHub issue #115.
   * The cvtsudoers utility has new --group-file and --passwd-file
     options to use a custom passwd or group file when the
     --match-local option is also used.
   * The cvtsudoers utility can now filter or match based on a command.
   * The cvtsudoers utility can now produce output in csv
     (comma-separated value) format. This can be used to help generate
     entitlement reports.
   * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd that could result in the connection
     being dropped for very long command lines.
   * Fixed a bug where sudo_logsrvd would not accept a restore point
     of zero.
   * Fixed a bug in visudo where the value of the editor setting was
     not used if it did not match the user’s EDITOR environment
     variable. This was only a problem if the env_editor setting was
     not enabled. Bug #1000.
   * Sudo now builds with the -fcf-protection compiler option and the
     -z now linker option if supported.
   * The output of sudoreplay -l now more closely matches the
     traditional sudo log format.
   * The sudo_sendlog utility will now use the full contents of the
     log.json file, if present. This makes it possible to send
     sudo-format I/O logs that use the newer log.json format to
     sudo_logsrvd without losing any information.
   * Fixed compilation of the arc4random_buf() replacement on systems
     with arc4random() but no arc4random_buf(). Bug #1008.
   * Sudo now uses its own getentropy() by default on Linux. The GNU
     libc version of getentropy() will fail on older kernels that
     don’t support the getrandom() system call.
   * It is now possible to build sudo with WolfSSL’s OpenSSL
     compatibility layer by using the --enable-wolfssl configure
     option.
   * Fixed a bug related to Daylight Saving Time when parsing
     timestamps in Generalized Time format. This affected the NOTBEFORE
     and NOTAFTER options in sudoers. Bug #1006.
   * Added the -O and -P options to visudo, which can be used to check
     or set the owner and permissions. This can be used in conjunction
     with the -c option to check that the sudoers file ownership and
     permissions are correct. Bug #1007.
   * It is now possible to set resource limits in the sudoers file
     itself. The special values default and “user” refer to the
     default system limit and invoking user limit respectively. The
     core dump size limit is now set to 0 by default unless overridden
     by the sudoers file.
   * The cvtsudoers utility can now merge multiple sudoers sources into
     a single, combined sudoers file. If there are conflicting entries,
     cvtsudoers will attempt to resolve them but manual intervention
     may be required. The merging of sudoers rules is currently fairly
     simplistic but will be improved in a future release.
   * Sudo was parsing but not applying the “deref” and “tls_reqcert”
     ldap.conf settings. This meant the options were effectively ignored
     which broke dereferencing of aliases in LDAP. Bug #1013.
   * Clarified in the sudo man page that the security policy may
     override the user’s PATH environment variable. Bug #1014.
   * When sudo is run in non-interactive mode (with the -n option), it
     will now attempt PAM authentication and only exit with an error if
     user interaction is required. This allows PAM modules that don’t
     interact with the user to succeed. Previously, sudo would not
     attempt authentication if the -n option was specified. Bug #956
     and GitHub issue #83.
   * Fixed a regression introduced in version 1.9.1 when sudo is built
     with the --with-fqdn configure option. The local host name was
     being resolved before the sudoers file was processed, making it
     impossible to disable DNS lookups by negating the fqdn sudoers
     option. Bug #1016.
   * Added support for negated sudoUser attributes in the LDAP and SSSD
     sudoers back ends. A matching sudoUser that is negated will cause
     the sudoRole containing it to be ignored.
   * Fixed a bug where the stack resource limit could be set to a value
     smaller than that of the invoking user and not be reset before the
     command was run. Bug #1016.
- sudo no longer ships schema for LDAP.

Wed Sep 22 12:27:51 UTC 2021 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.8p2
  * Fixed a potential out-of-bounds read with "sudo -i" when the
    target user's shell is bash.  This is a regression introduced
    in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #998.
  * sudo_logsrvd now only sends a log ID for first command of a session.
    There is no need to send the log ID for each sub-command.
  * Fixed a few minor memory leaks in intercept mode.
  * Fixed a problem with sudo_logsrvd in relay mode if "store_first"
    was enabled when handling sub-commands.  A new zero-length journal
    file was created for each sub-command instead of simply using
    the existing journal file.

- update to 1.9.8p1
  * Fixed support for passing a prompt (sudo -p) or a login class
    (sudo -l) on the command line.  This is a regression introduced
    in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #993.
  * Fixed a crash with "sudo ALL" rules in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends.
    This is a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #994.
  * Fixed a compilation error when the --enable-static-sudoers configure
    option was specified.  This is a regression introduced in sudo
    1.9.8 caused by a symbol clash with the intercept and log server
    protobuf functions.
  * It is now possible to transparently intercepting sub-commands
    executed by the original command run via sudo.  Intercept support
    is implemented using LD_PRELOAD (or the equivalent supported by
    the system) and so has some limitations.  The two main limitations
    are that only dynamic executables are supported and only the
    execl, execle, execlp, execv, execve, execvp, and execvpe library
    functions are currently intercepted. Its main use case is to
    support restricting privileged shells run via sudo.
    To support this, there is a new "intercept" Defaults setting and
    an INTERCEPT command tag that can be used in sudoers.  For example:
      Cmnd_Alias SHELLS=/bin/bash, /bin/sh, /bin/csh, /bin/ksh, /bin/zsh
      Defaults!SHELLS intercept
    would cause sudo to run the listed shells in intercept mode.
    This can also be set on a per-rule basis.  For example:
      Cmnd_Alias SHELLS=/bin/bash, /bin/sh, /bin/csh, /bin/ksh, /bin/zsh
      chuck ALL = INTERCEPT: SHELLS
    would only apply intercept mode to user "chuck" when running one
    of the listed shells.
    In intercept mode, sudo will not prompt for a password before
    running a sub-command and will not allow a set-user-ID or
    set-group-ID program to be run by default.  The new
    intercept_authenticate and intercept_allow_setid sudoers settings
    can be used to change this behavior.
  * The new "log_subcmds" sudoers setting can be used to log additional
    commands run in a privileged shell.  It uses the same mechanism as
    the intercept support described above and has the same limitations.
  * The new "log_exit_status" sudoers setting can be used to log
    the exit status commands run via sudo.  This is also a corresponding
    "log_exit" setting in the sudo_logsrvd.conf eventlog stanza.
  * Support for logging sudo_logsrvd errors via syslog or to a file.
    Previously, most sudo_logsrvd errors were only visible in the
    debug log.
  * Better diagnostics when there is a TLS certificate validation error.
  * Using the "+=" or "-=" operators in a Defaults setting that takes
    a string, not a list, now produces a warning from sudo and a
    syntax error from inside visudo.
  * Fixed a bug where the "iolog_mode" setting in sudoers and sudo_logsrvd
    had no effect when creating I/O log parent directories if the I/O log
    file name ended with the string "XXXXXX".
  * Fixed a bug in the sudoers custom prompt code where the size
    parameter that was passed to the strlcpy() function was incorrect.
    No overflow was possible since the correct amount of memory was
    already pre-allocated.
  * The mksigname and mksiglist helper programs are now built with
    the host compiler, not the target compiler, when cross-compiling.
    Bug #989.
  * Fixed compilation error when the --enable-static-sudoers configure
    option was specified.  This was due to a typo introduced in sudo
    1.9.7.  GitHub PR #113.

   strings, not numbers.  The JSON spec does not actually support
   octal numbers with a '0' prefix.
 * Fixed a compilation issue on Solaris 9.
 * Sudo now can handle the getgroups() function returning a different
   number of groups for subsequent invocations.  GitHub PR #106.
 * When loading a Python plugin, python_plugin.so now verifies
   that the module loaded matches the one we tried to load.  This
   allows sudo to display a more useful error message when trying
   to load a plugin with a name that conflicts with a Python module
   installed in the system location.
 * Sudo no longer sets the the open files resource limit to "unlimited"
   while it runs.  This avoids a problem where sudo's closefrom()
   emulation would need to close a very large number of descriptors
   on systems without a way to determine which ones are actually open.
 * Sudo now includes a configure check for va_copy or __va_copy and
   only defines its own version if the configure test fails.
 * Fixed a bug in sudo's utmp file handling which prevented old
   entries from being reused.  As a result, the utmp (or utmpx)
   file was appended to unnecessarily.  GitHub PR #108.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.7 that prevented sudo_logsrvd
   from accepting TLS connections when OpenSSL is used.  Bug #988.
 * Fixed an SELinux sudoedit bug when the edited temporary file
   could not be opened.  The sesh helper would still be run even
   when there are no temporary files available to install.
 * Fixed a compilation problem on FreeBSD.
 * The sudo_noexec.so file is now built as a module on all systems
   other than macOS.  This makes it possible to use other libtool
   implementations such as slibtool.  On macOS shared libraries and
   modules are not interchangeable and the version of libtool shipped
   with sudo must be used.
 * Fixed a few bugs in the getgrouplist() emulation on Solaris when
   reading from the local group file.
 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd that prevented periodic relay server
   connection retries from occurring in "store_first" mode.
 * Disabled the nss_search()-based getgrouplist() emulation on HP-UX
   due to a crash when the group source is set to "compat" in
   /etc/nsswitch.conf.  This is probably due to a mismatch between
   include/compat/nss_dbdefs.h and what HP-UX uses internally.  On
   HP-UX we now just cycle through groups the slow way using
   getgrent().  Bug #978.

- update to 1.9.7
  * The "fuzz" Makefile target now runs all the fuzzers for 8192
    passes (can be overridden via the FUZZ_RUNS variable).  This makes
    it easier to run the fuzzers in-tree.  To run a fuzzer indefinitely,
    set FUZZ_RUNS=-1, e.g. "make FUZZ_RUNS=-1 fuzz".
  * Fixed fuzzing on FreeBSD where the ld.lld linker returns an
    error by default when a symbol is multiply-defined.
  * Added support for determining local IPv6 addresses on systems
    that lack the getifaddrs() function.  This now works on AIX,
    HP-UX and Solaris (at least).  Bug #969.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.6 that caused "sudo -V" to
    report a usage error.  Also, when invoked as sudoedit, sudo now
    allows a more restricted set of options that matches the usage
    statement and documentation.  GitHub issue #95.
  * Fixed a crash in sudo_sendlog when the specified certificate
    or key does not exist or is invalid.  Bug #970
  * Fixed a compilation error when sudo is configured with the
    --disable-log-client option.
  * Sudo's limited support for SUCCESS=return entries in nsswitch.conf
    is now documented.  Bug #971.
  * Sudo now requires autoconf 2.70 or higher to regenerate the
    configure script.  Bug #972.
  * sudo_logsrvd now has a relay mode which can be used to create
    a hierarchy of log servers.  By default, when a relay server is
    defined, messages from the client are forwarded immediately to
    the relay.  However, if the "store_first" setting is enabled,
    the log will be stored locally until the command completes and
    then relayed.  Bug #965.
  * Sudo now links with OpenSSL by default if it is available unless
    the --disable-openssl configure option is used or both the
    --disable-log-client and --disable-log-server configure options
    are specified.
  * Fixed configure's Python version detection when the version minor
    number is more than a single digit, for example Python 3.10.
  * The sudo Python module tests now pass for Python 3.10.
  * Sudo will now avoid changing the datasize resource limit
    as long as the existing value is at least 1GB.  This works around
    a problem on 64-bit HP-UX where it is not possible to exactly
    restore the original datasize limit.  Bug #973.
  * Fixed a race condition that could result in a hang when sudo is
    executed by a process where the SIGCHLD handler is set to SIG_IGN.
    This fixes the bug described by GitHub PR #98.
  * Fixed an out-of-bounds read in sudoedit and visudo when the
    EDITOR, VISUAL or SUDO_EDITOR environment variables end in an
    unescaped backslash.  Also fixed the handling of quote characters
    that are escaped by a backslash.  GitHub issue #99.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the "log_server_verify" sudoers option
    from taking effect.
  * The sudo_sendlog utility has a new -s option to cause it to stop
    sending I/O records after a user-specified elapsed time.  This
    can be used to test the I/O log restart functionality of sudo_logsrvd.
  * Fixed a crash introduced in sudo 1.9.4 in sudo_logsrvd when
    attempting to restart an interrupted I/O log transfer.
  * The TLS connection timeout in the sudoers log client was previously
    hard-coded to 10 seconds.  It now uses the value of log_server_timeout.
  * The configure script now outputs a summary of the user-configurable
    options at the end, separate from output of configure script tests.
    Bug #820.
  * Corrected the description of which groups may be specified via the
    -g option in the Runas_Spec section.  Bug #975.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 20 18:25:12 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.6p1
 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.6 that resulted in an
   error message instead of a usage message when sudo is run with
   no arguments.
 * Fixed a sudo_sendlog compilation problem with the AIX xlC compiler.
 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where the
   --disable-root-mailer configure option had no effect.
 * Added a --disable-leaks configure option that avoids some
   memory leaks on exit that would otherwise occur.  This is intended
   to be used with development tools that measure memory leaks.  It
   is not safe to use in production at this time.
 * Plugged some memory leaks identified by oss-fuzz and ASAN.
 * Fixed the handling of sudoOptions for an LDAP sudoRole that
   contains multiple sudoCommands.  Previously, some of the options
   would only be applied to the first sudoCommand.
 * Fixed a potential out of bounds read in the parsing of NOTBEFORE
   and NOTAFTER sudoers command options (and their LDAP equivalents).
 * The parser used for reading I/O log JSON files is now more
   resilient when processing invalid JSON.
 * Fixed typos that prevented "make uninstall" from working.
 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where the last line
   in a sudoers file might not have a terminating NUL character
   added if no newline was present.
 * Integrated oss-fuzz and LLVM's libFuzzer with sudo.  The new
   --enable-fuzzer configure option can be combined with the
   --enable-sanitizer option to build sudo with fuzzing support.
   Multiple fuzz targets are available for fuzzing different parts
   of sudo.  Fuzzers are built and tested via "make fuzz" or as part
   of "make check" (even when sudo is not built with fuzzing support).
   Fuzzing support currently requires the LLVM clang compiler (not gcc).
 * Fixed the --enable-static-sudoers configure option.
 * Fixed a potential out of bounds read sudo when is run by a user
   with more groups than the value of "max_groups" in sudo.conf.
 * Added an "admin_flag" sudoers option to make the use of the
   ~/.sudo_as_admin_successful file configurable on systems where
   sudo is build with the --enable-admin-flag configure option.
   This mostly affects Ubuntu and its derivatives.
 * The "max_groups" setting in sudo.conf is now limited to 1024.
   This setting is obsolete and should no longer be needed.
 * Fixed a bug in the tilde expansion of "CHROOT=dir" and "CWD=dir"
   sudoers command options.  A path "~/foo" was expanded to
   "/home/userfoo" instead of "/home/user/foo".  This also affects
   the runchroot and runcwd Defaults settings.
 * Fixed a bug on systems without a native getdelim(3) function
   where very long lines could cause parsing of the sudoers file
   to end prematurely.
 * Fixed a potential integer overflow when converting the
   timestamp_timeout and passwd_timeout sudoers settings to a
   timespec struct.
 * The default for the "group_source" setting in sudo.conf is now
   "dynamic" on macOS.  Recent versions of macOS do not reliably
   return all of a user's non-local groups via getgroups(2), even
   when _DARWIN_UNLIMITED_GETGROUPS is defined.
 * Fixed a potential use-after-free in the PAM conversation function.
 * Fixed potential redefinition of sys/stat.h macros in sudo_compat.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 27 00:25:10 UTC 2021 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- Update to 1.9.5.p2
    * When invoked as sudoedit, the same set of command line
      options are now accepted as for sudo -e. The -H and -P
      options are now rejected for sudoedit and sudo -e which
      matches the sudo 1.7 behavior. This is part of the fix for
      CVE-2021-3156.
    * Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes
      in the command's arguments. Normally, sudo escapes special
      characters when running a command via a shell (sudo -s or
      sudo -i). However, it was also possible to run sudoedit with
      the -s or -i flags in which case no escaping had actually
      been done, making a buffer overflow possible.
      This fixes CVE-2021-3156. (bsc#1181090)
    * Fixed sudo's setprogname(3) emulation on systems that don't
      provide it.
    * Fixed a problem with the sudoers log server client where a
      partial write to the server could result the sudo process
      consuming large amounts of CPU time due to a cycle in the
      buffer queue. Bug #954.
    * Added a missing dependency on libsudo_util in libsudo_eventlog.
      Fixes a link error when building sudo statically.
    * The user's KRB5CCNAME environment variable is now preserved
      when performing PAM authentication. This fixes GSSAPI
      authentication when the user has a non-default ccache.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 14 08:54:04 UTC 2021 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.5.p1
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.5 where the editor run
    by sudoedit was set-user-ID root unless SELinux RBAC was in use.
    The editor is now run with the user's real and effective user-IDs.

- News in 1.9.5
  * Fixed a crash introduced in 1.9.4 when running "sudo -i" as an
    unknown user.  This is related to but distinct from Bug #948.
  * If the "lecture_file" setting is enabled in sudoers, it must now
    refer to a regular file or a symbolic link to a regular file.
  * Fixed a potential use-after-free bug in sudo_logsrvd when the
    server shuts down if there are existing connections from clients
    that are only logging events and not session I/O data.
  * Fixed a buffer size mismatch when serializing the list of IP
    addresses for configured network interfaces.  This bug is not
    actually exploitable since the allocated buffer is large enough
    to hold the list of addresses.
  * If sudo is executed with a name other than "sudo" or "sudoedit",
    it will now fall back to "sudo" as the program name.  This affects
    warning, help and usage messages as well as the matching of Debug
    lines in the /etc/sudo.conf file.  Previously, it was possible
    for the invoking user to manipulate the program name by setting
    argv[0] to an arbitrary value when executing sudo. (bsc#1180687)
  * Sudo now checks for failure when setting the close-on-exec flag
    on open file descriptors.  This should never fail but, if it
    were to, there is the possibility of a file descriptor leak to
    a child process (such as the command sudo runs).
  * Fixed CVE-2021-23239, a potential information leak in sudoedit
    that could be used to test for the existence of directories not
    normally accessible to the user in certain circumstances.  When
    creating a new file, sudoedit checks to make sure the parent
    directory of the new file exists before running the editor.
    However, a race condition exists if the invoking user can replace
    (or create) the parent directory.  If a symbolic link is created
    in place of the parent directory, sudoedit will run the editor
    as long as the target of the link exists.  If the target of the
    link does not exist, an error message will be displayed.  The
    race condition can be used to test for the existence of an
    arbitrary directory.  However, it _cannot_ be used to write to
    an arbitrary location. (bsc#1180684)
  * Fixed CVE-2021-23240, a flaw in the temporary file handling of
    sudoedit's SELinux RBAC support.  On systems where SELinux is
    enabled, a user with sudoedit permissions may be able to set the
    owner of an arbitrary file to the user-ID of the target user.
    On Linux kernels that support "protected symlinks", setting
    /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks to 1 will prevent the bug from
    being exploited.  For more information see
    https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/sudoedit_selinux.html. (bsc#1180685)
  * Added writability checks for sudoedit when SELinux RBAC is in use.
    This makes sudoedit behavior consistent regardless of whether
    or not SELinux RBAC is in use.  Previously, the "sudoedit_checkdir"
    setting had no effect for RBAC entries.
  * A new sudoers option "selinux" can be used to disable sudo's
    SELinux RBAC support.
  * Quieted warnings from PVS Studio, clang analyzer, and cppcheck.
    Added suppression annotations for PVS Studio false positives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 21 17:13:59 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.4p2
  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.4p1 which could lead to a crash
    if the sudoers file contains a runas user-specific Defaults entry.
    Bug #951.

- News in 1.9.4p1
  * Fixed a regression introduced in version 1.9.4 where sudo would
    not build when configured using the --without-sendmail option.
    Bug #947.
  * Fixed a problem where if I/O logging was disabled and sudo was
    unable to connect to sudo_logsrvd, the command would still be
    allowed to run even when the "ignore_logfile_errors" sudoers
    option was enabled.
  * Fixed a crash introduced in version 1.9.4 when attempting to run
    a command as a non-existent user.  Bug #948.
  * The installed sudo.conf file now has the default sudoers Plugin
    lines commented out.  This fixes a potential conflict when there
    is both a system-installed version of sudo and a user-installed
    version.  GitHub issue #75.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where sudo would run
    the command as a child process even when a pseudo-terminal was
    not in use and the "pam_session" and "pam_setcred" options were
    disabled.  GitHub issue #76.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.9 where the "closefrom"
    sudoers option could not be set to a value of 3.  Bug #950.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 30 17:36:19 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.4
  * The sudoers parser will now detect when an upper-case reserved
    word is used when declaring an alias.  Now instead of "syntax
    error, unexpected CHROOT, expecting ALIAS" the message will be
    "syntax error, reserved word CHROOT used as an alias name".
    Bug #941.
  * Better handling of sudoers files without a final newline.
    The parser now adds a newline at end-of-file automatically which
    removes the need for special cases in the parser.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 in the sssd back-end
    where an uninitialized pointer could be freed on an error path.
    GitHub issue #67.
  * The core logging code is now shared between sudo_logsrvd and
    the sudoers plugin.
  * JSON log entries sent to syslog now use "minimal" JSON which
    skips all non-essential whitespace.
  * The sudoers plugin can now produce JSON-formatted logs.  The
    "log_format" sudoers option can be used to select sudo or json
    format logs.  The default is sudo format logs.
  * The sudoers plugin and visudo now display the column number in
    syntax error messages in addition to the line number.  Bug #841.
  * If I/O logging is not enabled but "log_servers" is set, the
    sudoers plugin will now log accept events to sudo_logsrvd.
    Previously, the accept event was only sent when I/O logging was
    enabled.  The sudoers plugin now sends reject and alert events too.
  * The sudo logsrv protocol has been extended to allow an AlertMessage
    to contain an optional array of InfoMessage, as AcceptMessage
    and RejectMessage already do.
  * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd where receipt of SIGHUP would result
    in duplicate entries in the debug log when debugging was enabled.
  * The visudo utility now supports EDITOR environment variables
    that use single or double quotes in the command arguments.
    Bug #942.
  * The PAM session modules now run when sudo is set-user-ID root,
    which allows a module to determine the original user-ID.
    Bug #944.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 in the LDAP back-end
    where sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter were applied even when the
    SUDOERS_TIMED setting was not present in ldap.conf.  Bug #945.
  * Sudo packages for macOS 11 now contain universal binaries that
    support both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs.
  * For sudo_logsrvd, an empty value for the "pid_file" setting in
    sudo_logsrvd.conf will now disable the process ID file.
- Remove sudo-1.9.3p1-pam_xauth.patch (upstreamed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 21:26:58 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.3p1
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.3 where the configure
    script would not detect the crypt(3) function if it was present
    in the C library, not an additional library.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 with shadow passwd
    file authentication on OpenBSD.  BSD authentication was not
    affected.
  * Sudo now logs when a user-specified command-line option is
    rejected by a sudoers rule.  Previously, these conditions were
    written to the audit log, but the default sudo log file.  Affected
    command line arguments include -C (--close-from), -D (--chdir),
    -R (--chroot), -g (--group) and -u (--user).

- News in 1.9.3
  * Fixed building the Python plugin on systems with a compiler that
    doesn't support symbol hiding.
  * Sudo now uses a linker script to hide symbols even when the
    compiler has native symbol hiding support.  This should make it
    easier to detect omissions in the symbol exports file, regardless
    of the platform.
  * Fixed the libssl dependency in Debian packages for older releases
    that use libssl1.0.0.
  * Sudo and visudo now provide more detailed messages when a syntax
    error is detected in sudoers.  The offending line and token are
    now displayed.  If the parser was generated by GNU bison,
    additional information about what token was expected is also
    displayed.  Bug #841.
  * Sudoers rules must now end in either a newline or the end-of-file.
    Previously, it was possible to have multiple rules on a single
    line, separated by white space.  The use of an end-of-line
    terminator makes it possible to display accurate error messages.
  * Sudo no longer refuses to run if a syntax error in the sudoers
    file is encountered.  The entry with the syntax error will be
    discarded and sudo will continue to parse the file.  This makes
    recovery from a syntax error less painful on systems where sudo
    is the primary method of superuser access.  The historic behavior
    can be restored by add "error_recovery=false" to the sudoers
    plugin's optional arguments in sudo.conf.  Bug #618.
  * Fixed the sample_approval plugin's symbol exports file for systems
    where the compiler doesn't support symbol hiding.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 where arguments to
    the "sudoers_policy" plugin in sudo.conf were not being applied.
    The sudoers file is now parsed by the "sudoers_audit" plugin,
    which is loaded implicitly when "sudoers_policy" is listed in
    sudo.conf.  Starting with sudo 1.9.3, if there are plugin arguments
    for "sudoers_policy" but "sudoers_audit" is not listed, those
    arguments will be applied to "sudoers_audit" instead.
  * The user's resource limits are now passed to sudo plugins in
    the user_info[] list.  A plugin cannot determine the limits
    itself because sudo changes the limits while it runs to prevent
    resource starvation.
  * It is now possible to set the working directory or change the
    root directory on a per-command basis using the CWD and CHROOT
    options.  There are also new Defaults settings, runchroot and
    runcwd, that can be used to set the working directory or root
    directory on a more global basis.
  * New -D (--chdir) and -R (--chroot) command line options can be
    used to set the working directory or root directory if the sudoers
    file allows it.  This functionality is not enabled by default
    and must be explicitly enabled in the sudoers file.

Fri Jul 24 08:47:34 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.9.2:
  * The configure script now uses pkg-config to find the openssl cflags
    and libs where possible.
  * The contents of the log.json I/O log file is now documented in
    the sudoers manual.
  * The sudoers plugin now properly exports the sudoers_audit symbol
    on systems where the compiler lacks symbol visibility controls.
    This caused a regression in 1.9.1 where a successful sudo command
    was not logged due to the missing audit plugin. Bug #931.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.1 that can result in crash
    when there is a syntax error in the sudoers file. Bug #934.

- Move python plugin support to own sub-package, we don't want
  python in a really minimal system [bsc#1173200]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 19 07:13:21 UTC 2020 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.1
  * Fixed an AIX-specific problem when I/O logging was enabled.
     The terminal device was not being properly set to raw mode.
     Bug #927.
   * Corrected handling of sudo_logsrvd connections without associated
     I/O log data.  This fixes support for RejectMessage as well as
     AcceptMessage when the expect_iobufs flag is not set.
   * Added an "iolog_path" entry to the JSON-format event log produced
     by sudo_logsrvd.  Previously, it was only possible to determine
     the I/O log file an event belonged to using sudo-format logs.
   * Fixed the bundle IDs for sudo-logsrvd and sudo-python macOS packages.
   * I/O log files produced by the sudoers plugin now clear the write
     bits on the I/O log timing file when the log is complete.  This
     is consistent with how sudo_logsrvd indicates that a log is
     complete.
   * The sudoreplay utility has a new "-F" (follow) command line
     option to allow replaying a session that is still in progress,
     similar to "tail -f".
   * The @include and @includedir directives can be used in sudoers
     instead of #include and #includedir.  In addition, include paths
     may now have embedded white space by either using a double-quoted
     string or escaping the space characters with a backslash.
   * When running a command in a pty, sudo will no longer try to
     suspend itself if the user's tty has been revoked (for instance
     when the parent ssh daemon is killed).  This fixes a bug where
     sudo would continuously suspend the command (which would succeed),
     then suspend itself (which would fail due to the missing tty)
     and then resume the command.
   * If sudo's event loop fails due to the tty being revoked, remove
     the user's tty events and restart the event loop (once).  This
     fixes a problem when running "sudo reboot" in a pty on some
     systems.  When the event loop exited unexpectedly, sudo would
     kill the command running in the pty, which in the case of "reboot",
     could lead to the system being in a half-rebooted state.
   * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 in the LDAP and
     SSSD back-ends where a missing sudoHost attribute was treated
     as an "ALL" wildcard value.  A sudoRole with no sudoHost attribute
     is now ignored as it was prior to version 1.8.23.
   * The audit plugin API has been changed slightly.  The sudo front-end
     now audits an accept event itself after all approval plugins are
     run and the I/O logging plugins (if any) are opened.  This makes
     it possible for an audit plugin to only log a single overall
     accept event if desired.
   * The sudoers plugin can now be loaded as an audit plugin.  Logging
     of successful commands is now performed in the audit plugin's
     accept function.  As a result, commands are now only logged if
     allowed by sudoers and all approval plugins.  Commands rejected
     by an approval plugin are now also logged by the sudoers plugin.
   * Romanian translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.
   * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.0 where sudoedit did
     not remove its temporary files after installing them.  Bug #929.
   * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.0 where the iolog_file
     setting in sudoers and sudo_logsrvd.conf caused an error if the
     file name ended in six or more X's.

- Update to 1.9.0rc5
  * The default TLS listener is now only enabled when either the
    TLS certificate file is explicitly specified in sudo_logsrvd.conf
    or the default TLS certificate file exists in the file system.
    There is no change in behavior for listen_address entries
    explicitly set in the configuration file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 12:14:26 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0rc4
  * Various spelling fixes. Bug #925.
  * The struct passwd passed to PAM session modules is now looked up
    by user name, not user-ID, when possible. Fixes a problem with
    the pam_limits module and configurations where multiple user names
    share the same ID. Debian bug #734752.
  * Sudo command line options that take a value may only be specified
    once. This is to help guard against problems caused by poorly
    written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input. Bug #924.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 07:37:58 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0rc3
  * The sudo-logsrvd package now installs a systemd service on Linux
    distros that use systemd.
  * The I/O plugin is now closed before the policy plugin on command
    exit.
  * When copying the edited files to the original path, sudoedit now
    allocates any additional space needed before writing. Previously,
    it could truncate the destination file if the file system was
    full. Bug #922.
  * Fixed a compilation issue with Python 3.8.
  * Changed how TLS connections are made to the log server. Instead
    of using a starttls type approach where TLS and plaintext
    connections share the same point we now use separate ports for
    plaintext and TLS connections. A (tls) flag can be specified after
    the host:port to indicate that the connection should be secured
    with TLS. This avoids a potention man-in-the-middle attack that
    could cause the connection to be forced into plaintext mode.
    Unfortunately, this change breaks compatibility with the
    previous release candidates.

- build with enable-python to support python plugins

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 17 11:51:49 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0rc2
  * Fixed a test failure in the strsig_test regress test on FreeBSD.
  * Sudo now includes a logging daemon, sudo_logsrvd, which can be
    used to implement centralized logging of I/O logs.  TLS connections
    are supported when sudo is configured with the --enable-openssl
    option.  For more information, see the sudo_logsrvd, logsrvd.conf
    and sudo_logsrv.proto manuals as well as the log_servers setting
    in the sudoers manual.
    The --disable-log-server and --disable-log-client configure
    options can be used to disable building the I/O log server and/or
    remote I/O log support in the sudoers plugin.
  * The new sudo_sendlog utility can be used to test sudo_logsrvd
    or send existing sudo I/O logs to a centralized server.
  * It is now possible to write sudo plugins in Python 3 when sudo
    is configured with the --enable-python> option.  See the
    sudo_plugin_python.man.html manual for details.
    Sudo 1.9.0 comes with several Python example plugins that get
    installed sudo's examples directory.
    The sudo blog article "What's new in sudo 1.9: Python"
    (https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/01/whats-new-in-sudo-1.9-python/)
    includes a simple tutorial on writing python plugins.
  * Sudo now supports an "audit" plugin type.  An audit plugin
    receives accept, reject, exit and error messages and can be used
    to implement custom logging that is independent of the underlying
    security policy.   Multiple audit plugins may be specified in
    the sudo.conf file.  A sample audit plugin is included that
    writes logs in JSON format.
  * Sudo now supports an "approval" plugin type.  An approval plugin
    is run only after the main security policy (such as sudoers) accepts
    a command to be run.  The approval policy may perform additional
    checks, potentially interacting with the user.  Multiple approval
    plugins may be specified in the sudo.conf file.  Only if all
    approval plugins succeed will the command be allowed.
  * Sudo's -S command line option now causes the sudo conversation
    function to write to the standard output or standard error instead
    of the terminal device.
  * It is now possible to use "Cmd_Alias" instead of "Cmnd_Alias" for
    people who find the former more natural.
  * The new "pam_ruser" and "pam_rhost" sudoers settings can be used
    to enable or disable setting the PAM remote user and/or host
    values during PAM session setup.
  * More than one SHA-2 digest may now be specified for a single
    command.  Multiple digests must be separated by a comma.
  * It is now possible to specify a SHA-2 digest in conjunction with
    the "ALL" reserved word in a command specification.  This allows
    one to give permission to run any command that matches the
    specified digest, regardless of its path.
  * Sudo and sudo_logsrvd now create an extended I/O log info file
    in JSON format that contains additional information about the
    command that was run, such as the host name.  The sudoreplay
    utility uses this file in preference to the legacy log file.
  * The sudoreplay utility can now match on a host name in list mode.
    The list output also now includes the host name if one is present
    in the log file.
  * For "sudo -i", if the target user's home directory does not
    exist, sudo will now warn about the problem but run the command
    in the current working directory.  Previously, this was a fatal
    error.  Debian bug #598519.
  * The command line arguments in the SUDO_COMMAND environment
    variable are now truncated at 4096 characters.  This avoids an
    "Argument list too long" error when executing a command with a
    large number of arguments.  Debian bug #596631.
  * Sudo now properly ends the PAM transaction when the user
    authenticates successfully but sudoers denies the command.
    Debian bug #669687.
  * The sudoers grammar in the manual now indicates that "sudoedit"
    requires one or more arguments.  Debian bug #571621.

Tue Mar 17 07:46:06 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.8.31p1
  * Sudo once again ignores a failure to restore the RLIMIT_CORE
    resource limit, as it did prior to version 1.8.29.
    Linux containers don't allow RLIMIT_CORE to be set back to
    RLIM_INFINITY if we set the limit to zero, even for root,
    which resulted in a warning from sudo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 19:21:23 UTC 2020 - Kristyna Streitova <kstreitova@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.31
  Major changes between version 1.8.31 and 1.8.30:
  * This version fixes a potential security issue that can lead to
    a buffer overflow if the pwfeedback option is enabled in
    sudoers [CVE-2019-18634] [bsc#1162202]
  * The sudoedit_checkdir option now treats a user-owned directory
    as writable, even if it does not have the write bit set at the
    time of check. Symbolic links will no longer be followed by
    sudoedit in any user-owned directory. Bug #912.
  * Fixed a crash introduced in sudo 1.8.30 when suspending sudo
    at the password prompt. Bug #914.
  * Fixed compilation on systems where the mmap MAP_ANON flag is
    not available. Bug #915.
  Major changes between version 1.8.30 and 1.8.29:
  * Sudo now closes file descriptors before changing uids. This
    prevents a non-root process from interfering with sudo's ability
    to close file descriptors on systems that support the prlimit(2)
    system call.
  * Sudo now treats an attempt to run sudo sudoedit as simply
    sudoedit If the sudoers file contains a fully-qualified path
    to sudoedit, sudo will now treat it simply as sudoedit
    (with no path). Visudo will will now treat a fully-qualified
    path to sudoedit as an error. Bug #871.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would warn
    about a missing /etc/environment file on AIX and Linux when
    PAM is not enabled. Bug #907.
  * Fixed a bug on Linux introduced in sudo 1.8.29 that prevented
    the askpass program from running due to an unlimited stack size
    resource limit. Bug #908.
  * If a group provider plugin has optional arguments, the argument
    list passed to the plugin is now NULL terminated as per the
    documentation.
  * The user's time stamp file is now only updated if both authentication
    and approval phases succeed. This is consistent with the behavior
    of sudo prior to version 1.8.23. Bug #910.
  * The new allow_unknown_runas_id sudoers setting can be used to
    enable or disable the use of unknown user or group IDs.
    Previously, sudo would always allow unknown user or group IDs if
    the sudoers entry permitted it, including via the ALL alias.
    As of sudo 1.8.30, the admin must explicitly enable support for
    unknown IDs.
  * The new runas_check_shell sudoers setting can be used to require
    that the runas user have a shell listed in the /etc/shells file.
    On many systems, users such as bin, do not have a valid shell and
    this flag can be used to prevent commands from being run as
    those users.
  * Fixed a problem restoring the SELinux tty context during reboot
    if mctransd is killed before sudo finishes. GitHub Issue #17.
  * Fixed an intermittent warning on NetBSD when sudo restores the
    initial stack size limit.
  Major changes between version 1.8.29 and 1.8.28p1:
  * The cvtsudoers command will now reject non-LDIF input when
    converting from LDIF format to sudoers or JSON formats.
  * The new log_allowed and log_denied sudoers settings make it
    possible to disable logging and auditing of allowed and/or
    denied commands.
  * The umask is now handled differently on systems with PAM or
    login.conf. If the umask is explicitly set in sudoers, that
    value is used regardless of what PAM or login.conf may specify.
    However, if the umask is not explicitly set in sudoers, PAM or
    login.conf may now override the default sudoers umask. Bug #900.
  * For make install, the sudoers file is no longer checked for syntax
    errors when DESTDIR is set. The default sudoers file includes the
    contents of /etc/sudoers.d which may not be readable as non-root.
    Bug #902.
  * Sudo now sets most resource limits to their maximum value to avoid
    problems caused by insufficient resources, such as an inability to
    allocate memory or open files and pipes. Fixed a regression introduced
    in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would refuse to run if the parent process was
    not associated with a session. This was due to sudo passing a session
    ID of -1 to the plugin.

Wed Oct 16 15:08:29 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8,28p1
  * The fix for Bug #869 caused "sudo -v" to prompt for a password
    when "verifypw" is set to "all" (the default) and all of the
    user's sudoers entries are marked with NOPASSWD.  Bug #901.
    [bsc#1162675]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 15:10:21 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.28
 * Fixed CVE-2019-14287 (bsc#1153674),
   a bug where a sudo user may be able to
   run a command as root when the Runas specification explicitly
   disallows root access as long as the ALL keyword is listed first.
   * Sudo will now only set PAM_TTY to the empty string when no
   terminal is present on Solaris and Linux.  This workaround is
   only needed on those systems which may have PAM modules that
   misbehave when PAM_TTY is not set.
 * The mailerflags sudoers option now has a default value even if
   sendmail support was disabled at configure time.  Fixes a crash
   when the mailerpath sudoers option is set but mailerflags is not.
   Bug #878.
 * Sudo will now filter out last login messages on HP-UX unless it
   a shell is being run via "sudo -s" or "sudo -i".  Otherwise,
   when trusted mode is enabled, these messages will be displayed
   for each command.
 * Sudo has a new -B command line option that will ring the terminal
   bell when prompting for a password.
 * Sudo no longer refuses to prompt for a password when it cannot
   determine the user's terminal as long as it can open /dev/tty.
   This allows sudo to function on systems where /proc is unavailable,
   such as when running in a chroot environment.
 * The "env_editor" sudoers flag is now on by default.  This makes
   source builds more consistent with the packages generated by
   sudo's mkpkg script.
 * Fixed a bad interaction with configure's --prefix and
   --disable-shared options.  Bug #886.
 * More verbose error message when a password is required and no terminal
   is present.  Bug #828.
 * Command tags, such as NOPASSWD, are honored when a user tries to run a
   command that is allowed by sudoers but which does not actually
   exist on the file system.  Bug #888.
 * I/O log timing files now store signal suspend and resume information
   in the form of a signal name instead of a number.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.24 that prevented sudo from honoring
   the value of "ipa_hostname" from sssd.conf, if specified, when
   matching the host name.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.21 that prevented the core dump
   resource limit set in the pam_limits module from taking effect.
   Bug #894.
 * Fixed parsing of double-quoted Defaults group and netgroup bindings.
 * The user ID is now used when matching sudoUser attributes in LDAP.
   Previously, the user name, group name and group IDs were used
   when matching but not the user ID.
 * Sudo now writes PAM messages to the user's terminal, if available,
   instead of the standard output or standard error.  This prevents
   PAM output from being intermixed with that of the command when
   output is sent to a file or pipe.  Bug #895.
 * Sudoedit now honors the umask and umask_override settings in sudoers.
   Previously, the user's umask was used as-is.
 * Fixed a bug where the terminal's file context was not restored
   when using SELinux RBAC.  Bug #898.

  * Sudo now treats the LOGNAME and USER environment variables
    (as well as the LOGIN variable on AIX) as a single unit
  * Added support for OpenLDAP TLS_REQCERT setting in ldap.conf
  * Sudo now logs when the command was suspended and resumed
    in the I/O logs

  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that prevented sudo
    from properly setting the user's groups on AIX.
  * The sudoers LDAP back-end now supports negated sudoRunAsUser

- Update to 1.8.22 [bsc#1080793]
  * Commands run in the background from a script run via sudo will
    no longer receive SIGHUP when the parent exits and I/O logging
    is enabled
  * A particularly offensive insult is now disabled by default
  * The description of sudo -i now correctly documents that the
    env_keep and env_check sudoers options are applied to the
    environment
  * Fixed a crash when the system's host name is not set
  * The sudoers2ldif script now handles #include and #includedir
    directives.
  * Fixed a bug where sudo would silently exit when the command
    was not allowed by sudoers and the passwd_tries sudoers option
    was set to a value less than one.
  * Fixed a bug with the listpw and verifypw sudoers options and
    multiple sudoers sources. If the option is set to all a
    password should be required unless none of a user's sudoers
    entries from any source require authentication.
  * Fixed a bug with the listpw and verifypw sudoers options in
    the LDAP and SSSD back-ends. If the option is set to any and
    the entry contained multiple rules, only the first matching
    rule was checked. If an entry contained more than one matching
    rule and the first rule required authentication but a
    subsequent rule did not, sudo would prompt for a password when
    it should not have.
  * When running a command as the invoking user (not root), sudo
    would execute the command with the same group vector it was
    started with. Sudo now executes the command with a new group
    vector based on the group database which is consistent with how
    su(1) operates.
  * Fixed a double free in the SSSD back-end that could occur when
    ipa_hostname is present in sssd.conf and is set to an unqualified
    host name.
  * When I/O logging is enabled, sudo will now write to the terminal
    even when it is a background process. Previously, sudo would only
    write to the tty when it was the foreground process when I/O
    logging was enabled. If the TOSTOP terminal flag is set, sudo
    will suspend the command (and then itself) with the SIGTTOU signal.
  * A new authfail_message sudoers option that overrides the default
    N incorrect password attempt(s).
  * An empty sudoRunAsUser attribute in the LDAP and SSSD backends
    will now match the invoking user. This is more consistent with
    how an empty runas user in the sudoers file is treated.
  * Documented that in check mode, visudo does not check the owner /
    mode on files specified with the -f flag
  * It is now an error to specify the runas user as an empty string
    on the command line. Previously, an empty runas user was treated
    the same as an unspecified runas user
  * When timestamp_type option is set to tty and a terminal is
    present, the time stamp record will now include the start time
    of the session leader. When the timestamp_type option is set
    to ppid or when no terminal is available, the start time of the
    parent process is used instead. This significantly reduces the
    likelihood of a time stamp record being re-used when a user logs
    out and back in again.
  * The sudoers time stamp file format is now documented in the new
    sudoers_timestamp manual.
  * Visudo will now use the SUDO_EDITOR environment variable (if
    present) in addition to VISUAL and EDITOR.

Major changes between sudo 1.8.21p2 and 1.8.21p1:
 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented sudo
   from using the PAM-supplied prompt.  Bug #799

   sudo hanging when running commands that exit quickly.  Bug #800
 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented the
   command from being run when the password was read via an external
   program using the askpass interface.  Bug #801

Major changes between sudo 1.8.21p1 and 1.8.21:
 * On systems that support both PAM and SIGINFO, the main sudo
   process will no longer forward SIGINFO to the command if the
   signal was generated from the keyboard.  The command will have
   already received SIGINFO since it is part of the same process
   group so there's no need for sudo to forward it.  This is
   consistent with the handling of SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTSTP.
   Bug #796
 * If SUDOERS_SEARCH_FILTER in ldap.conf does not specify a value,
   the LDAP search expression used when looking up netgroups and
   non-Unix groups had a syntax error if a group plugin was not
   specified.
 * "sudo -U otheruser -l" will now have an exit value of 0 even
   if "otheruser" has no sudo privileges.  The exit value when a
   user attempts to lists their own privileges or when a command
   is specified is unchanged.
 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.21 where sudoreplay
   playback would hang for I/O logs that contain terminal input.
 * Sudo 1.8.18 contained an incomplete fix for the matching of
   entries in the LDAP and SSSD backends when a sudoRunAsGroup is
   specified but no sudoRunAsUser is present in the sudoRole.

Major changes between sudo 1.8.21 and 1.8.20p2:
 * The path that sudo uses to search for terminal devices can now
   be configured via the new "devsearch" Path setting in sudo.conf.
 * It is now possible to preserve bash shell functions in the
   environment when the "env_reset" sudoers setting is disabled by
   removing the "*=()*" pattern from the env_delete list.
 * A change made in sudo 1.8.15 inadvertantly caused sudoedit to
   send itself SIGHUP instead of exiting when the editor returns
   an error or the file was not modified.
 * Sudoedit now uses an exit code of zero if the file was not
   actually modified.  Previously, sudoedit treated a lack of
   modifications as an error.
 * When running a command in a pseudo-tty (pty), sudo now copies a
   subset of the terminal flags to the new pty.  Previously, all
   flags were copied, even those not appropriate for a pty.
 * Fixed a problem with debug logging in the sudoers I/O logging
   plugin.
 * Window size change events are now logged to the policy plugin.
   On xterm and compatible terminals, sudoreplay is now capable of
   resizing the terminal to match the size of the terminal the
   command was run on.  The new -R option can be used to disable
   terminal resizing.
 * Fixed a bug in visudo where a newly added file was not checked
   for syntax errors.  Bug #791.
 * Fixed a bug in visudo where if a syntax error in an include
   directory (like /etc/sudoers.d) was detected, the edited version
   was left as a temporary file instead of being installed.
 * On PAM systems, sudo will now treat "username's Password:" as
   a standard password prompt.  As a result, the SUDO_PROMPT
   environment variable will now override "username's Password:"
   as well as the more common "Password:".  Previously, the
   "passprompt_override" Defaults setting would need to be set for
   SUDO_PROMPT to override a prompt of "username's Password:".
 * A new "syslog_pid" sudoers setting has been added to include
   sudo's process ID along with the process name when logging via
   syslog.  Bug #792.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where a command would
   not be terminated when the I/O logging plugin returned an error
   to the sudo front-end.
 * A new "timestamp_type" sudoers setting has been added that replaces
   the "tty_tickets" option.  In addition to tty and global time stamp
   records, it is now possible to use the parent process ID to restrict
   the time stamp to commands run by the same process, usually the shell.
   Bug #793.
 * The --preserve-env command line option has been extended to accept
   a comma-separated list of environment variables to preserve.
   Bug #279.
 * Friulian translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  1 07:04:16 UTC 2017 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.20p2 which obsoletes patches:
  * sudo-1.8.19p2-CVE-2017-1000367.patch
  * sudo-1.8.19p2-decrement_env_len.patch
  * sudo-1.8.19p2-dont_overwrite_ret_val.patch

Major changes between sudo 1.8.20p2 and 1.8.20p1:

 * Fixed a bug parsing /proc/pid/stat on Linux when the process
   name contains newlines. This is not exploitable due to the /dev
   traversal changes in sudo 1.8.20p1.
   [bsc#1042146], [CVE-2017-1000368]

Major changes between sudo 1.8.20p1 and 1.8.20:

 * Fixed "make check" when using OpenSSL or GNU crypt.
   Bug #787.
 * Fixed CVE-2017-1000367, a bug parsing /proc/pid/stat on Linux
   when the process name contains spaces.  Since the user has control
   over the command name, this could potentially be used by a user
   with sudo access to overwrite an arbitrary file on systems with
   SELinux enabled.  Also stop performing a breadth-first traversal
   of /dev when looking for the device; only a hard-coded list of
   directories are checked,

Major changes between sudo 1.8.20 and 1.8.19p2:

 * Added support for SASL_MECH in ldap.conf. Bug #764
 * Added support for digest matching when the command is a glob-style
   pattern or a directory. Previously, only explicit path matches
   supported digest checks.
 * New "fdexec" Defaults option to control whether a command
   is executed by path or by open file descriptor.
 * The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.11.
 * Fixed a bug that prevented sudoers include files with a relative
   path starting with the letter 'i' from being opened.  Bug #776.
 * Added support for command timeouts in sudoers.  The command will
   be terminated if the timeout expires.
 * The SELinux role and type are now displayed in the "sudo -l"
   output for the LDAP and SSSD backends, just as they are in the
   sudoers backend.
 * A new command line option, -T, can be used to specify a command
   timeout as long as the user-specified timeout is not longer than
   the timeout specified in sudoers.  This option may only be
   used when the "user_command_timeouts" flag is enabled in sudoers.
 * Added NOTBEFORE and NOTAFTER command options to the sudoers
   backend similar to what is already available in the LDAP backend.
 * Sudo can now optionally use the SHA2 functions in OpenSSL or GNU
   crypt instead of the SHA2 implementation bundled with sudo.
 * Fixed a compilation error on systems without the stdbool.h header
   file.  Bug #778.
 * Fixed a compilation error in the standalone Kerberos V authentication
   module.  Bug #777.
 * Added the iolog_flush flag to sudoers which causes I/O log data
   to be written immediately to disk instead of being buffered.
 * I/O log files are now created with group ID 0 by default unless
   the "iolog_user" or "iolog_group" options are set in sudoers.
 * It is now possible to store I/O log files on an NFS-mounted
   file system where uid 0 is remapped to an unprivileged user.
   The "iolog_user" option must be set to a non-root user and the
   top-level I/O log directory must exist and be owned by that user.
 * Added the restricted_env_file setting to sudoers which is similar
   to env_file but its contents are subject to the same restrictions
   as variables in the invoking user's environment.
 * Fixed a use after free bug in the SSSD backend when the fqdn
   sudoOption is enabled and no hostname value is present in
   /etc/sssd/sssd.conf.
 * Fixed a typo that resulted in a compilation error on systems
   where the killpg() function is not found by configure.

 * Fixed a compilation error with the included version of zlib
   when sudo was built outside the source tree.
 * Fixed the exit value of sudo when the command is terminated by
   a signal other than SIGINT.  This was broken in sudo 1.8.15 by
   the fix for Bug #722.  Bug #784.
 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where the "lecture"
   option could not be used in a positive boolean context, only
   a negative one.
 * Fixed an issue where sudo would consume stdin if it was not
   connected to a tty even if log_input is not enabled in sudoers.
   Bug #786.
 * Clarify in the sudoers manual that the #includedir directive
   diverts control to the files in the specified directory and,
   when parsing of those files is complete, returns control to the
   original file.  Bug #775.

Mon Dec 19 23:08:10 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.19p1

Major changes between sudo 1.8.19p1 and 1.8.19:
 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.19 that resulted in the wrong
   syslog priority and facility being used.

Major changes between sudo 1.8.19 and 1.8.18p1:
 * New "syslog_maxlen" Defaults option to control the maximum size of
   syslog messages generated by sudo.
 * Sudo has been run against PVS-Studio and any issues that were
   not false positives have been addressed.
 * I/O log files are now created same group ID as the parent directory
   and not the invoking user's group ID.
 * I/O log permissions and ownership are now configurable via the
   "iolog_mode", "iolog_user" and "iolog_group" sudoers Defaults
   variables.
 * Fixed configuration of the sudoers I/O log plugin debug subsystem.
   Previously, I/O log information was not being written to the
   sudoers debug log.
 * Fixed a bug in visudo that broke editing of files in an include
   dir that have a syntax error.  Normally, visudo does not edit
   those files, but if a syntax error is detected in one, the user
   should get a chance to fix it.
 * Warnings about unknown or unparsable sudoers Defaults entries now
   include the file and line number of the problem.
 * Visudo will now use the file and line number information about an
   unknown or unparsable Defaults entry to go directly to the file
   with the problem.
 * Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end where a negated sudoHost
   entry would prevent other sudoHost entries following it from matching.
 * Warnings from visudo about a cycle in an Alias entry now include the
   file and line number of the problem.
 * In strict mode, visudo will now use the file and line number
   information about a cycle in an Alias entry to go directly to the
   file with the problem.
 * The sudo_noexec.so file is now linked with -ldl on systems that
   require it for the wordexp() wrapper.
 * Fixed linking of sudo_noexec.so on macOS systems where it must be
   a dynamic library and not a module.
 * Sudo's "make check" now includes a test for sudo_noexec.so
   working.
 * The sudo front-end now passes the user's umask to the plugin.
   Previously the plugin had to determine this itself.
 * Sudoreplay can now display the stdin and ttyin streams when they
   are explicitly added to the filter list.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.17 where the "all" setting
   for verifypw and listpw was not being honored.  Bug #762.
 * The syslog priority (syslog_goodpri and syslog_badpri) can now
   be negated or set to "none" to disable logging of successful or
   unsuccessful sudo attempts via syslog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 08:53:16 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.18p1 with these major changes:
 * When sudo_noexec.so is used, the WRDE_NOCMD flag is now added
   if the wordexp() function is called.  This prevents commands
   from being run via wordexp() without disabling it entirely.
 * On Linux systems, sudo_noexec.so now uses a seccomp filter to
   disable execute access if the kernel supports seccomp.  This is
   more robust than the traditional method of using stub functions
   that return an error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 20:13:29 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.18
 * The sudoers locale is now set before parsing the sudoers file.
   If sudoers_locale is set in sudoers, it is applied before
   evaluating other Defaults entries.  Previously, sudoers_locale
   was used when evaluating sudoers but not during the inital parse.
   Bug #748.
 * A missing or otherwise invalid #includedir is now ignored instead
   of causing a parse error.
 * During "make install", backup files are only used on HP-UX where
   it is not possible to unlink a shared object that is in use.
   This works around a bug in ldconfig on Linux which could create
   links to the backup shared library file instead of the current
   one.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where sudoers entries with long
   commands lines could be truncated, preventing a match.  Bug #752.
 * The fqdn, runas_default and sudoers_locale Defaults settings are
   now applied before any other Defaults settings since they can
   change how other Defaults settings are parsed.
 * On systems without the O_NOFOLLOW open(2) flag, when the NOFOLLOW
   flag is set, sudoedit now checks whether the file is a symbolic link
   before opening it as well as after the open.  Bug #753.
 * Sudo will now only resolve a user's group IDs to group names
   when sudoers includes group-based permissions.  Group lookups
   can be expensive on some systems where the group database is
   not local.
 * If the file system holding the sudo log file is full, allow
   the command to run unless the new ignore_logfile_errors Defaults
   option is disabled.  Bug #751.
 * The ignore_audit_errors and ignore_iolog_errors Defaults options
   have been added to control sudo's behavior when it is unable to
   write to the audit and I/O logs.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the SIGPIPE signal handler
   was not being restored when sudo directly executes the command.
 * Fixed a bug where "sudo -l command" would indicate that a command
   was runnable even when denied by sudoers when using the LDAP or
   SSSD backends.
 * The match_group_by_gid Defaults option has been added to allow
   sites where group name resolution is slow and where sudoers only
   contains a small number of groups to match groups by group ID
   instead of by group name.
 * Fixed a bug on Linux where a 32-bit sudo binary could fail with
   an "unable to allocate memory" error when run on a 64-bit system.
   Bug #755
 * When parsing ldap.conf, sudo will now only treat a '#' character
   as the start of a comment when it is at the beginning of the
   line.
 * Fixed a potential crash when auditing is enabled and the audit
   function fails with an error.  Bug #756
 * Norwegian Nynorsk translation for sudo from translationproject.org.
 * Fixed a typo that broke short host name matching when the fqdn
   flag is enabled in sudoers.  Bug #757
 * Negated sudoHost attributes are now supported by the LDAP and
   SSSD backends.
 * Fixed matching entries in the LDAP and SSSD backends when a
   RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.
 * Fixed "sudo -l" output in the LDAP and SSSD backends when a
   RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 21:02:46 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- update to 1.8.17p1:
  * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the user's groups were
    not set on systems that don't use PAM.  Bug #749.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 19 14:01:44 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- removed obsolete patch sudo-1.8.16-pam_groups.patch
- update to 1.8.17:
 * On AIX, if /etc/security/login.cfg has auth_type set to PAM_AUTH
   but pam_start(3) fails, fall back to AIX authentication.
   Bug #740.
 * Sudo now takes all sudoers sources into account when determining
   whether or not "sudo -l" or "sudo -b" should prompt for a password.
   In other words, if both file and ldap sudoers sources are in
   specified in /etc/nsswitch.conf, "sudo -v" will now require that
   all entries in both sources be have NOPASSWD (file) or !authenticate
   (ldap) in the entries.
 * Sudo now ignores SIGPIPE until the command is executed.  Previously,
   SIGPIPE was only ignored in a few select places.  Bug #739.
 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 where (non-syslog) log
   file entries were missing the newline when loglinelen is set to
   a non-positive number.  Bug #742.
 * Unix groups are now set before the plugin session intialization
   code is run.  This makes it possible to use dynamic groups with
   the Linux-PAM pam_group module.
 * Fixed a bug where a debugging statement could dereference a NULL
   pointer when looking up a group that doesn't exist.  Bug #743.
 * Sudo has been run through the Coverity code scanner.  A number of
   minor bugs have been fixed as a result.  None were security issues.
 * SELinux support, which was broken in 1.8.16, has been repaired.
 * Fixed a bug when logging I/O where all output buffers might not
   get flushed at exit.
 * Forward slashes are no longer escaped in the JSON output of
   "visudo -x".  This was never required by the standard and not
   escaping them improves readability of the output.
 * Sudo no longer treats PAM_SESSION_ERR as a fatal error when
   opening the PAM session.  Other errors from pam_open_session()
   are still treated as fatal.  This avoids the "policy plugin
   failed session initialization" error message seen on some systems.
 * Korean translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.
 * Fixed a bug on AIX where the stack size hard resource limit was
   being set to 2GB instead of 4GB on 64-bit systems.
 * The SSSD backend now properly supports "sudo -U otheruser -l".
 * The SSSD backend now uses the value of "ipa_hostname"
   from sssd.conf, if specified, when matching the host name.
 * Fixed a hang on some systems when the command is being run in
   a pty and it failed to execute.
 * When performing a wildcard match in sudoers, check for an exact
   string match if the user command was fully-qualified (or resolved
   via the PATH).  This fixes an issue executing scripts on Linux
   when there are multiple wildcard matches with the same base name.
   Bug #746.

- update to 1.8.16:
 * Fixed a compilation error on Solaris 10 with Stun Studio 12.
   Bug #727.
 * When preserving variables from the invoking user's environment, if
   there are duplicates sudo now only keeps the first instance.
 * Fixed a bug that could cause warning mail to be sent in list
   mode (sudo -l) for users without sudo privileges when the
   LDAP and sssd backends are used.
 * Fixed a bug that prevented the "mail_no_user" option from working
   properly with the LDAP backend.
 * In the LDAP and sssd backends, white space is now ignored between
   an operator (!, +, +=, -=) when parsing a sudoOption.
 * It is now possible to disable Path settings in sudo.conf
   by omitting the path name.
 * The sudoedit_checkdir Defaults option is now enabled by default
   and has been extended.  When editing files with sudoedit, each
   directory in the path to be edited is now checked.  If a directory
   is writable by the invoking user, symbolic links will not be
   followed.  If the parent directory of the file to be edited is
   writable, sudoedit will refuse to edit it.
   Bug #707.
 * The netgroup_tuple Defaults option has been added to enable matching
   of the entire netgroup tuple, not just the host or user portion.
   Bug #717.
 * When matching commands based on the SHA2 digest, sudo will now
   use fexecve(2) to execute the command if it is available.  This
   fixes a time of check versus time of use race condition when the
   directory holding the command is writable by the invoking user.
 * On AIX systems, sudo now caches the auth registry string along
   with password and group information.  This fixes a potential
   problem when a user or group of the same name exists in multiple
   auth registries.  For example, local and LDAP.
 * Fixed a crash in the SSSD backend when the invoking user is not
   found.  Bug #732.
 * Added the --enable-asan configure flag to enable address sanitizer
   support.  A few minor memory leaks have been plugged to quiet
   the ASAN leak detector.
 * The value of _PATH_SUDO_CONF may once again be overridden via
   the Makefile.  Bug #735.
 * The sudoers2ldif script now handles multiple roles with same name.
 * Fixed a compilation error on systems that have the posix_spawn()
   and posix_spawnp() functions but an unusable spawn.h header.
   Bug #730.
 * Fixed support for negating character classes in sudo's version
   of the fnmatch() function.
 * Fixed a bug in the LDAP and SSSD backends that could allow an
   unauthorized user to list another user's privileges.  Bug #738.
 * The PAM conversation function now works around an ambiguity in the
   PAM spec with respect to multiple messages.  Bug #726.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  6 11:55:17 UTC 2015 - kstreitova@suse.com

- update to 1.8.15:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented sudo from building outside the source
    tree on some platforms. Bug #708.
  * Fixed the location of the sssd library in the RHEL/Centos packages.
    Bug #710.
  * Fixed a build problem on systems that don't implicitly include
    sys/types.h from other header files. Bug #711.
  * Fixed a problem on Linux using containers where sudo would ignore
    signals sent by a process in a different container.
  * Sudo now refuses to run a command if the PAM session module returns
    an error.
  * When editing files with sudoedit, symbolic links will no longer be
    followed by default. The old behavior can be restored by enabling
    the sudoedit_follow option in sudoers or on a per-command basis with
    the FOLLOW and NOFOLLOW tags. Bug #707.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.14 that caused the last valid
    editor in the sudoers "editor" list to be used by visudo and sudoedit
    instead of the first. Bug #714.
  * Fixed a bug in visudo that prevented the addition of a final newline
    to edited files without one.
  * Fixed a bug decoding certain base64 digests in sudoers when the
    intermediate format included a '=' character.
  * Individual records are now locked in the time stamp file instead of
    the entire file. This allows sudo to avoid prompting for a password
    multiple times on the same terminal when used in a pipeline.
    In other words, sudo cat foo | sudo grep bar now only prompts for
    the password once. Previously, both sudo processes would prompt for
    a password, often making it impossible to enter. Bug #705.
  * Fixed a bug where sudo would fail to run commands as a non-root user
    on systems that lack both setresuid() and setreuid(). Bug #713.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented visudo from
    re-editing the correct file when a syntax error was detected.
  * Fixed a bug where sudo would not relay a SIGHUP signal to the command
    when the terminal is closed and the command is not run in its own
    pseudo-tty. Bug #719.
  * If some, but not all, of the LOGNAME, USER or USERNAME environment
    variables have been preserved from the invoking user's environment,
    sudo will now use the preserved value to set the remaining variables
    instead of using the runas user. This ensures that if, for example,
    only LOGNAME is present in the env_keep list, that sudo will not set
    USER and USERNAME to the runas user.
  * When the command sudo is running dies due to a signal, sudo will now
    send itself that same signal with the default signal handler installed
    instead of exiting. The bash shell appears to ignore some signals,
    e.g. SIGINT, unless the command being run is killed by that signal.
    This makes the behavior of commands run under sudo the same as
    without sudo when bash is the shell. Bug #722.
  * Slovak translation for sudo from translationproject.org.
  * Hungarian and Slovak translations for sudoers from
    translationproject.org.
  * Previously, when env_reset was enabled (the default) and the
    -s option was not used, the SHELL environment variable was set to the
    shell of the invoking user. Now, when env_reset is enabled and the
    -s option is not used, SHELL is set based on the target user.
  * Fixed challenge/response style BSD authentication.
  * Added the sudoedit_checkdir Defaults option to prevent sudoedit from
    editing files located in a directory that is writable by the
    invoking user.
  * Added the always_query_group_plugin Defaults option to control
    whether groups not found in the system group database are passed to
    the group plugin. Previously, unknown system groups were always
    passed to the group plugin.
  * When creating a new file, sudoedit will now check that the file's
    parent directory exists before running the editor.
  * Fixed the compiler stack protector test in configure for compilers
    that support -fstack-protector but don't actually have the ssp
    library available.

    * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14p2 that prevented sudo
      from working when no tty was present. Bug #706.
    * Fixed tty detection on newer AIX systems where dev_t is 64-bit.
  * changes in 1.8.14p2
    * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the
      lecture file from being created. Bug #704.
  * changes in 1.8.14p1
    * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the sssd
      backend from working. Bug #703.
  * changes in 1.8.14
    * Log messages on Mac OS X now respect sudoers_locale when sudo
      is build with NLS support.
    * The sudo manual pages now pass mandoc -Tlint with no warnings.
    * Fixed a compilation problem on systems with the sig2str()
      function that do not define SIG2STR_MAX in signal.h.
    * Worked around a compiler bug that resulted in unexpected
      behavior when returning an int from a function declared to
      return bool without an explicit cast.
    * Worked around a bug in Mac OS X 10.10 BSD auditing where the
      au_preselect() fails for AUE_sudo events but succeeds for
      AUE_DARWIN_sudo.
    * Fixed a hang on Linux systems with glibc when sudo is linked
      with jemalloc.
    * When the user runs a command as a user ID that is not present
      in the password database via the -u flag, the command is now
      run with the group ID of the invoking user instead of group ID 0.
    * Fixed a compilation problem on systems that don't pull in
      definitions of uid_t and gid_t without sys/types.h or unistd.h.
    * Fixed a compilation problem on newer AIX systems which use a
      struct st_timespec for time stamps in struct stat that differs
      from struct timespec. Bug #702.
    * The example directory is now configurable via --with-exampledir
      and defaults to DATAROOTDIR/examples/sudo on BSD systems.
    * The /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/sudo.conf file is now installed as part
      of "make install" when systemd is in use.
    * Fixed a linker problem on some systems with libintl. Bug #690.
    * Fixed compilation with compilers that don't support __func__ or
      __FUNCTION__.
    * Sudo no longer needs to uses weak symbols to support localization
      in the warning functions. A registration function is used instead.
    * Fixed a setresuid() failure in sudoers on Linux kernels where
      uid changes take the nproc resource limit into account.
    * Fixed LDAP netgroup queries on AIX.
    * Sudo will now display the custom prompt on Linux systems with
      PAM even if the "Password: " prompt is not localized by the
      PAM module. Bug #701.
    * Double-quoted values in an LDAP sudoOption are now supported
      for consistency with file-based sudoers.
    * Fixed a bug that prevented the btime entry in /proc/stat from
      being parsed on Linux.
  * update sudo-sudoers.patch
  * remove sudo-parse_boottime_properly.patch (it's not longer needed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 14 12:47:49 UTC 2015 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.13
 * The examples directory is now a subdirectory of the doc dir to
   conform to Debian guidelines.  Bug #682.
 * Fixed a compilation error for siglist.c and signame.c on some
   systems.  Bug #686
 * Weak symbols are now used for sudo_warn_gettext() and
   sudo_warn_strerror() in libsudo_util to avoid link errors when
   -Wl,--no-undefined is used in LDFLAGS.  The --disable-weak-symbols
   configure option can be used to disable the user of weak symbols.
 * Fixed a bug in sudo's mkstemps() replacement function that
   prevented the file extension from being preserved in sudoedit.
 * A new mail_all_cmnds sudoers flag will send mail when a user runs
   a command (or tries to). The behavior of the mail_always flag has
   been restored to always send mail when sudo is run.
 * New "MAIL" and "NOMAIL" command tags have been added to toggle
   mail sending behavior on a per-command (or Cmnd_Alias) basis.
 * Fixed matching of empty passwords when sudo is configured to
   use passwd (or shadow) file authentication on systems where the
   crypt() function returns NULL for invalid salts.
 * The "all" setting for listpw and verifypw now works correctly
   with LDAP and sssd sudoers.
 * The sudo timestamp directory is now created at boot time on
   platforms that use systemd.
 * Sudo will now restore the value of the SIGPIPE handler before
   executing the command.
 * Sudo now uses "struct timespec" instead of "struct timeval" for
   time keeping when possible.  If supported, sudoedit and visudo
   now use nanosecond granularity time stamps.
 * Fixed a symbol name collision with systems that have their own
   SHA2 implementation.  This fixes a problem where PAM could use
   the wrong SHA2 implementation on Solaris 10 systems configured
   to use SHA512 for passwords.
 * The editor invoked by sudoedit once again uses an unmodified
   copy of the user's environment as per the documentation.  This
   was inadvertantly changed in sudo 1.8.0.  Bug #688.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 22 15:29:28 UTC 2015 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.12 (fixes bnc#918953)
- changelog:
  * The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.8 and
    is now installed as a shared library where supported.
  * Debug settings for the sudo front end and sudoers plugin are now configured separately.
  * Multiple sudo.conf Debug entries may now be specified per program (or plugin).
  * The plugin API has been extended such that the path to the plugin
    that was loaded is now included in the settings array. This path
    can be used to register with the debugging subsystem. The debug_flags
    setting is now prefixed with a file name and may be specified multiple
    times if there is more than one matching Debug setting in sudo.conf.
  * The sudoers regression tests now run with the locale set to C since
    some of the tests compare output that includes locale-specific messages. Bug #672.
  * Fixed a bug where sudo would not run commands on Linux when compiled
    with audit support if audit is disabled. Bug #671.
  * The default password prompt now includes a trailing space after
    "Password:" for consistency with su(1) on most systems. Bug #663.
  * Visudo will now use the optional sudoers_file, sudoers_mode,
    sudoers_uid and sudoers_gid arguments if specified on the sudoers.so Plugin line in the sudo.conf file.
  * Fixed a problem introduced in sudo 1.8.8 that prevented the full
    host name from being used when the fqdn sudoers option is used. Bug #678.
  * Sudo now installs a handler for SIGCHLD signal handler immediately
    before stating the process that will execute the command (or start the monitor).
  * Removed a limit on the length of command line arguments expanded by
    a wild card using sudo's version of the fnmatch() function.
    This limit was introduced when sudo's version of fnmatch() was replaced in sudo 1.8.4.
  * LDAP-based sudoers can now query an LDAP server for a user's netgroups
    directly. This is often much faster than fetching every sudoRole object
    containing a sudoUser that begins with a `+' prefix and checking
    whether the user is a member of any of the returned netgroups.
  * The mail_always sudoers option no longer sends mail for
    sudo -l or sudo -v unless the user is unable to authenticate themselves.
  * Fixed a crash when sudo is run with an empty argument vector.
  * Fixed two potential crashes when sudo is run with very low resource limits.
  * The TZ environment variable is now checked for safety instead of simply
    being copied to the environment of the command. This fixes a potential security issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  6 12:35:03 UTC 2014 - fstrba@suse.com

- update to 1.8.11p2
  * Fixed a bug where dynamic shared objects loaded from a plugin
    could use the hooked version of getenv() but not the hooked
    versions of putenv(), setenv() or unsetenv().  This can cause
    problems for PAM modules that use those functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 11 02:09:17 UTC 2014 - tabraham@suse.com

- refresh sudo-sudoers.patch
- update to 1.8.11p1
  * Fixed a compilation problem on some systems when the
    --disable-shared-libutil configure option was specified.
  * The user can no longer interrupt the sleep after an incorrect password on
    PAM systems using pam_unix. Bug #666.
  * Fixed a compilation problem on Linux systems that do not use PAM. Bug #667.
  * "make install" will now work with the stock GNU autotools install-sh
    script. Bug #669.
  * Fixed a crash with "sudo -i" when the current working directory does not
    exist. Bug #670.
  * Fixed a potential crash in the debug subsystem when logging a message
    larger that 1024 bytes.
  * Fixed a "make check" failure for ttyname when stdin is closed and stdout
    and stderr are redirected to a different tty. Bug #643.
  * Added BASH_FUNC_* to environment blacklist to match newer-style bash
    functions.

- changes from 1.8.11
  * The sudoers plugin no longer uses setjmp/longjmp to recover from fatal
    errors. All errors are now propagated to the caller via return codes.
  * When running a command in the background, sudo will now forward SIGINFO to
    the command (if supported).
  * Sudo will now use the system versions of the sha2 functions from libc or
    libmd if available.
  * Visudo now works correctly on GNU Hurd. Bug #647.
  * Fixed suspend and resume of curses programs on some system when the
    command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal. Bug #649.
  * Fixed a crash with LDAP-based sudoers on some systems when Kerberos was
    enabled.
  * Sudo now includes optional Solaris audit support.
  * Catalan translation for sudoers from translationproject.org.
  * Norwegian Bokmaal translation for sudo from translationproject.org.
  * Greek translation for sudoers from translationproject.org
  * The sudo source tree has been reorganized to more closely resemble that of
    other gettext-enabled packages.
  * Sudo and its associated programs now link against a shared version of
    libsudo_util. The --disable-shared-libutil configure option may be used to
    force static linking if the --enable-static-sudoers option is also
    specified.
  * The passwords in ldap.conf and ldap.secret may now be encoded in base64.
  * Audit updates. SELinux role changes are now audited. For sudoedit, we now
    audit the actual editor being run, instead of just the sudoedit command.
  * Fixed bugs in the man page post-processing that could cause portions of the
    manuals to be removed.
  * Fixed a crash in the system_group plugin. Bug #653.
  * Fixed sudoedit on platforms without a native version of the getprogname()
    function. Bug #654.
  * Fixed compilation problems with some pre-C99 compilers.
  * Fixed sudo's -C option which was broken in version 1.8.9.
  * It is now possible to match an environment variable's value as well as its
    name using env_keep and env_check. This can be used to preserve bash
    functions which would otherwise be removed from the environment.
  * New files created via sudoedit as a non-root user now have the proper
    group id. Bug #656.
  * Sudoedit now works correctly in conjunction with sudo's SELinux RBAC
    support. Temporary files are now created with the proper security context.
  * The sudo I/O logging plugin API has been updated. If a logging function
    returns an error, the command will be terminated and all of the plugin's
    logging functions will be disabled. If a logging function rejects the
    command's output it will no longer be displayed to the user's terminal.
  * Fixed a compilation error on systems that lack openpty(), _getpty() and
    grantpt(). Bug #660.
  * Fixed a hang when a sudoers source is listed more than once in a single
    sudoers nsswitch.conf entry.
  * On AIX, shell scripts without a #! magic number are now passed to
    /usr/bin/sh, not /usr/bin/bsh. This is consistent with what the execvp()
    function on AIX does and matches historic sudo behavior. Bug #661.
  * Fixed a cross-compilation problem building mksiglist and mksigname.
    Bug #662.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 15 13:00:31 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.10p3
  * Fixed expansion of the %p escape in the prompt for "sudo -l"
    when rootpw, runaspw or targetpw is set. Bug #639.
  * Fixed matching of uids and gids which was broken in version 1.8.9
  * PAM credential initialization has been re-enabled. It was
    unintentionally disabled by default in version 1.8.8. The way
    credentials are initialized has also been fixed. Bug #642.
  * Fixed a descriptor leak on Linux when determing boot time. Sudo
    normally closes extra descriptors before running a command so
    the impact is limited. Bug #645.
  * Fixed flushing of the last buffer of data when I/O logging is
    enabled. This bug, introduced in version 1.8.9, could cause
    incomplete command output on some systems. Bug #646.
  * Fixed a hang introduced in sudo 1.8.10 when timestamp_timeout
    is set to zero. Bug #638.
- don't install test LICENSE with executable perms

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 14 14:46:59 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.10p1
  * Fixed a bug with netgated commands in "sudo -l command" that
    could cause the command to be listed even when it was explicitly
    denied. This only affected list mode when a command was specified.
    Bug #636.
  * It is now possible to disable network interface probing in sudo.conf
    by changing the value of the probe_interfaces setting.
  * When listing a user's privileges (sudo -l), the sudoers plugin
    will now prompt for the user's password even if the targetpw,
    rootpw or runaspw options are set.
  * The sudoers plugin uses a new format for its time stamp files.
    Bug #616.
  * sudo's -K option will now remove all of the user's time stamps,
    not just the time stamp for the current terminal.
    The -k option can be used to only disable time stamps for
    the current terminal.
  * If sudo was started in the background and needed to prompt for a
    password, it was not possible to suspend it at the password prompt
  * LDAP-based sudoers now uses a default search filter of
    (objectClass=sudoRole) for more efficient queries.
    The netgroup query has been modified to avoid falling below the
    minimum length for OpenLDAP substring indices.
  * The new use_netgroups sudoers option can be used to explicitly
    enable or disable netgroups support. For LDAP-based sudoers,
    netgroup support requires an expensive substring match on the server.
    If netgroups are not needed, this option can be disabled to
    reduce the load on the LDAP server.
  * Sudo is once again able to open the sudoers file when the group
    on sudoers doesn't match the expected value, so long as the
    file is not group writable.
  * Sudo now installs an init.d script to clear the time stamp
    directory at boot time on AIX and HP-UX systems.
    These systems either lack /var/run or do not clear it on boot.
  * The JSON format used by visudo -x now properly supports the
    negation operator. In addition, the Options object is now
    the same for both Defaults and Cmnd_Specs.
  * Fixed parsing of the "umask" defaults setting in sudoers. Bug #632.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 19:47:28 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.9p4
  * Fixed a bug where sudo could consume large amounts of CPU while
    the command was running when I/O logging is not enabled.
    Bug #631 (bnc#861153)
  * Fixed a bug where sudo would exit with an error when the debug
    level is set to util@debug or all@debug and I/O logging is not
    enabled. The command would continue runnning after sudo exited.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 14 10:49:21 UTC 2014 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.9p3
- set secure_path to /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
- changes since 1.8.8:
  * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.9 that prevented the tty name
    from being resolved properly on Linux systems.  Bug #630.
  * Updated config.guess, config.sub and libtool to support the ppc64le
    architecture (IBM PowerPC Little Endian).
  * Fixed a problem with gcc 4.8's handling of bit fields that could
    lead to the noexec flag being enabled even when it was not
    explicitly set.
  * Reworked sudo's main event loop to use a simple event subsystem
    using poll(2) or select(2) as the back end.
  * It is now possible to statically compile the sudoers plugin into
    the sudo binary without disabling shared library support.  The
    sudo.conf file may still be used to configure other plugins.
  * Sudo can now be compiled again with a C preprocessor that does
    not support variadic macros.
  * Visudo can now export a sudoers file in JSON format using the
    new -x flag.
  * The locale is now set correctly again for visudo and sudoreplay.
  * The plugin API has been extended to allow the plugin to exclude
    specific file descriptors from the "closefrom" range.
  * There is now a workaround for a Solaris-specific problem where
    NOEXEC was overriding traditional root DAC behavior.
  * Add user netgroup filtering for SSSD. Previously, rules for
    a netgroup were applied to all even when they did not belong
    to the specified netgroup.
  * On systems with BSD login classes, if the user specified a group
    (not a user) to run the command as, it was possible to specify
    a different login class even when the command was not run as the
    super user.
  * The closefrom() emulation on Mac OS X now uses /dev/fd if possible.
  * Fixed a bug where sudoedit would not update the original file
    from the temporary when PAM or I/O logging is not enabled.
  * When recycling I/O logs, the log files are now truncated properly.
  * Fixes bugs #617, #621, #622, #623, #624, #625, #626

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  8 09:21:18 UTC 2013 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.8
- drop sudo-plugins-sudoers-sssd.patch (upstream)
  * Removed a warning on PAM systems with stacked auth modules
    where the first module on the stack does not succeed.
  * Sudo, sudoreplay and visudo now support GNU-style long options.
  * The -h (--host) option may now be used to specify a host name.
    This is currently only used by the sudoers plugin in conjunction
    with the -l (--list) option.
  * Sudo's LDAP SASL support now works properly with Kerberos.
    Previously, the SASL library was unable to locate the user's
    credential cache.
  * It is now possible to set the nproc resource limit to unlimited
    via pam_limits on Linux (bug #565).
  * New "pam_service" and "pam_login_service" sudoers options
    that can be used to specify the PAM service name to use.
  * New "pam_session" and "pam_setcred" sudoers options that
    can be used to disable PAM session and credential support.
  * The sudoers plugin now properly supports UIDs and GIDs
    that are larger than 0x7fffffff on 32-bit platforms.
  * Fixed a visudo bug introduced in sudo 1.8.7 where per-group
    Defaults entries would cause an internal error.
  * If the "tty_tickets" sudoers option is enabled (the default),
    but there is no tty present, sudo will now use a ticket file
    based on the parent process ID.  This makes it possible to support
    the normal timeout behavior for the session.
  * Fixed a problem running commands that change their process
    group and then attempt to change the terminal settings when not
    running the command in a pseudo-terminal.  Previously, the process
    would receive SIGTTOU since it was effectively a background
    process.  Sudo will now grant the child the controlling tty and
    continue it when this happens.
  * The "closefrom_override" sudoers option may now be used in
    a command-specified Defaults entry (bug #610).
  * Fixed visudo's -q (--quiet) flag, broken in sudo 1.8.6.
  * Root may no longer change its SELinux role without entering
    a password.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.7 where the indexes written
    to the I/O log timing file are two greater than they should be.
    Sudoreplay now contains a work-around to parse those files.

- Update to upstream release 1.8.7
  * remove CVE-2013-1775
  * remove CVE-2013-1776
  * The non-Unix group plugin is now supported when sudoers data is stored in LDAP.
  * User messages are now always displayed in the user's locale, even when the
  same message is being logged or mailed in a different locale.
  * Log files created by sudo now explicitly have the group set to group ID 0
  rather than relying on BSD group semantics (which may not be the default).
  * A new exec_background sudoers option can be used to initially run the
  command without read access to the terminal when running a command in a
  pseudo-tty.
  * Sudo now produces better error messages when there is an error in the sudo.conf file.
  * Two new settings have been added to sudo.conf to give the admin better control of
  how group database queries are performed.
  * There is now a standalone sudo.conf manual page.
  * New support for specifying a SHA-2 digest along with the command in sudoers.
  Supported hash types are sha224, sha256, sha384 and sha512. See the description
  of Digest_Spec in the sudoers manual or the description of sudoCommand in the
  sudoers.ldap manual for details.
  * Fixed potential false positives in visudo's alias cycle detection.
  * Sudo now only builds Position Independent Executables (PIE) by default on Linux
  systems and verifies that a trivial test program builds and runs.

* Fixed a race condition that could cause sudo to receive SIGTTOU (and stop)
  when resuming a shell that was run via sudo when I/O logging (and use_pty) is not enabled.
* The sudoers plugin now takes advantage of symbol visibility controls when supported by the compiler or linker.
* Sending SIGTSTP directly to the sudo process will now suspend
   the running command when I/O logging (and use_pty) is not enabled.

- add explicit buildrequire on groff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 13 19:08:05 CEST 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8.5p2:
  + Fixed use of the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable which was
    broken in Sudo 1.8.5.
  + Fixed a problem reading the sudoers file when the file mode is
    more restrictive than the expected mode.  For example, when the
    expected sudoers file mode is 0440 but the actual mode is 0400.
- Changes from version 1.8.5p1:
  + Fixed a bug that prevented files in an include directory from
    being evaluated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 16 15:27:32 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.5
  Some of the changes:
  * /etc/environment is no longer read directly on Linux systems when
    PAM is used. Sudo now merges the PAM environment into the user's
    environment which is typically set by the pam_env module.
  * The plugin API has been extended
  * The policy plugin's init_session function is now called by the
    parent sudo process, not the child process that executes the command
    This allows the PAM session to be open and closed in the same process,
    which some PAM modules require.
  * A new group provider plugin, system_group, is included
  * Fixed a potential security issue in the matching of hosts against
    an IPv4 network specified in sudoers.The flaw may allow a user who
    is authorized to run commands on hosts belonging to one IPv4
    network to run commands on a different host (CVE-2012-2337)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  9 14:19:44 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.4p2
  Some of the changes:
  * The -D flag in sudo has been replaced with a more general
    debugging framework that is configured in sudo.conf.
  * Fixed a crash with sudo -i when a runas group was specified
    without a runas user.
  * New Serbian and Spanish translations for sudo from translationproject.org.
    LDAP-based sudoers may now access by group ID in addition to group name.
  * visudo will now fix the mode on the sudoers file even if no
    changes are made unless the -f option is specified.
  * On systems that use login.conf, sudo -i now sets environment
    variables based on login.conf
  * values in the LDAP search expression are now escaped as per RFC 4515
  * The deprecated "noexec_file" sudoers option is no longer supported.
  * Fixed a race condition when I/O logging is not enabled that could
    result in tty-generated signals (e.g. control-C) being received
    by the command twice.
  * visudo -c will now list any include files that were checked in
    addition to the main sudoers file when everything parses OK.
  * Users that only have read-only access to the sudoers file may
    now run visudo -c. Previously, write permissions were required
    even though no writing is down in check-only mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 31 12:30:58 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to 1.8.3p2
  * Fixed a format string vulnerability when the sudo binary
    (or a symbolic link to the sudo binary) contains printf
    format escapes and the -D (debugging) flag is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 25 15:09:14 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- honour global CFLAGS and LDFLAGS when compiling sesh,
  to avoid rpmlint error (bnc#743157)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  4 16:54:23 UTC 2012 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to sudo-1.8.3p1
  * Fixed a crash in the monitor process on Solaris when NOPASSWD
    was specified or when authentication was disabled.
  * Fixed matching of a Runas_Alias in the group section of a Runas_Spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 28 06:45:07 UTC 2011 - aj@suse.de

- Set timedir correctly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 24 08:42:33 UTC 2011 - vcizek@suse.com

- update to sudo-1.8.3
  - Fixed expansion of strftime() escape sequences
    in the log_dir sudoers setting.
  - Esperanto, Italian and Japanese
    translations from translationproject.org.
  - Added --enable-werror configure option for gcc's
  -Werror flag.  - Visudo no longer
    assumes all editors support the +linenumber command line argument.
    It now uses a whitelist of editors known to support the option.
  - Fixed matching of network addresses when a netmask is specified but
    the address is not the first one in the CIDR block.
  - The configure script now check whether or not errno.h declares the
    errno variable. Previously, sudo would always declare errno itself
    for older systems that don't declare it in errno.h.
  - The NOPASSWD tag is now honored for denied commands too,
    which matches historic sudo behavior (prior to sudo 1.7.0).
  - Sudo now honors the DEREF
    setting in ldap.conf which controls how alias dereferencing is done
    during an LDAP search.
  - A symbol conflict with the
    pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module that would cause a crash been
    resolved.
  - The inability to load a group provider plugin is no
    longer a fatal error.
  - A potential crash in the utmp handling
    code has been fixed.
  - Two PAM session issues have been resolved.
    In previous versions of sudo, the PAM session was opened as one
    user and closed as another. Additionally, if no authentication was
    performed, the PAM session would never be closed.
  - The LOGNAME,
    USER and USERNAME environment variables are preserved correctly
    again in sudoedit mode.
- grp-include.patch no longer needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 13 00:59:49 UTC 2011 - prusnak@opensuse.org

- updated to sudo-1.8.2
  * Sudo, visudo, sudoreplay and the sudoers plug-in now have natural
    language support (NLS). This can be disabled by passing configure
    the --disable-nls option.  Sudo will use gettext(), if available,
    to display translated messages.  All translations are coordinated
    via The Translation Project, http://translationproject.org/.
  * Plug-ins are now loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag instead of
    RTLD_LOCAL.  This fixes missing symbol problems in PAM modules
    on certain platforms, such as FreeBSD and SuSE Linux Enterprise.
  * I/O logging is now supported for commands run in background mode
    (using sudo's -b flag).
  * Group ownership of the sudoers file is now only enforced when
    the file mode on sudoers allows group readability or writability.
  * Visudo now checks the contents of an alias and warns about cycles
    when the alias is expanded.
  * If the user specifes a group via sudo's -g option that matches
    the target user's group in the password database, it is now
    allowed even if no groups are present in the Runas_Spec.
  * The sudo Makefiles now have more complete dependencies which are
    automatically generated instead of being maintained manually.
  * The "use_pty" sudoers option is now correctly passed back to the
    sudo front end.  This was missing in previous versions of sudo
    1.8 which prevented "use_pty" from being honored.
  * "sudo -i command" now works correctly with the bash version
    2.0 and higher.  Previously, the .bash_profile would not be
    sourced prior to running the command unless bash was built with
    NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS defined.
  * When matching groups in the sudoers file, sudo will now match
    based on the name of the group instead of the group ID. This can
    substantially reduce the number of group lookups for sudoers
    files that contain a large number of groups.
  * Multi-factor authentication is now supported on AIX.
  * Added support for non-RFC 4517 compliant LDAP servers that require
    that seconds be present in a timestamp, such as Tivoli Directory Server.
  * If the group vector is to be preserved, the PATH search for the
    command is now done with the user's original group vector.
  * For LDAP-based sudoers, the "runas_default" sudoOption now works
    properly in a sudoRole that contains a sudoCommand.
  * Spaces in command line arguments for "sudo -s" and "sudo -i" are
    now escaped with a backslash when checking the security policy.
- added missing include (grp-include.patch)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 20 12:10:45 UTC 2011 - puzel@novell.com

- update to sudo-1.8.1p2
  - Two-character CIDR-style IPv4 netmasks are now matched
    correctly in the sudoers file.
  - A non-existent includedir is now treated the same as an empty
    directory and not reported as an error.
  - Removed extraneous parens in LDAP filter when
    sudoers_search_filter is enabled that can cause an LDAP search
    error.
  - A new LDAP setting, sudoers_search_filter, has been added to
    ldap.conf.  This setting can be used to restrict the set of
    records returned by the LDAP query.  Based on changes from
    Matthew Thomas.
  - White space is now permitted within a User_List when used in
    conjunction with a per-user Defaults definition.
  - A group ID (%#gid) may now be specified in a User_List or
    Runas_List.  Likewise, for non-Unix groups the syntax is
    %:#gid.
  - Support for double-quoted words in the sudoers file has been
    fixed.  The change in 1.7.5 for escaping the double quote
    character caused the double quoting to only be available at the
    beginning of an entry.
  - The fix for resuming a suspended shell in 1.7.5 caused problems
    with resuming non-shells on Linux.  Sudo will now save the
    process group ID of the program it is running on suspend and
    restore it when resuming, which fixes both problems.
  - A bug that could result in corrupted output in "sudo -l" has
    been fixed.
  - Sudo will now create an entry in the utmp (or utmpx) file when
    allocating a pseudo-tty (e.g. when logging I/O).  The
    "set_utmp" and "utmp_runas" sudoers file options can be used to
    control this.  Other policy plugins may use the "set_utmp" and
    "utmp_user" entries in the command_info list.
  - The sudoreplay utility now supports arbitrary session IDs.
    Previously, it would only work with the base-36 session IDs
    that the sudoers plugin uses by default.
  - Sudo now passes "run_shell=true" to the policy plugin in the
    settings list when sudo's -s command line option is specified.
    The sudoers policy plugin uses this to implement the "set_home"
    sudoers option which was missing from sudo 1.8.0.
  - The "noexec" functionality has been moved out of the sudoers
    policy plugin and into the sudo front-end, which matches the
    behavior documented in the plugin writer's guide.  As a result,
    the path to the noexec file is now specified in the sudo.conf
    file instead of the sudoers file.
  - The exit values for "sudo -l", "sudo -v" and "sudo -l command"
    have been fixed in the sudoers policy plugin.
  - Sudo now parses command line arguments before loading any
    plugins.  This allows "sudo -V" or "sudo -h" to work even if
    there is a problem with sudo.conf
- drop sudo-dont-ignore-LDFLAGS.patch (merged upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 17 10:24:49 UTC 2011 - puzel@novell.com

- update to sudo-1.8.0
  * Sudo has been refactored to use a modular framework that can
    support third-party policy and I/O logging plugins.
  * Defaults settings that are tied to a user, host or command may
    now include the negation operator. For example:
         Defaults:!millert lecture
    will match any user but millert.
  * The default PATH environment variable, used when no PATH
    variable exists, now includes /usr/sbin and /sbin.
  * Support for logging I/O for the command being run.
  * Sudo will now use the Linux audit system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 24 16:19:35 UTC 2010 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 1.7.2p4
  * Fixed the expansion of the %h escape in #include file names
    introduced in sudo 1.7.1.
  * Fixed a a bug where the negation operator in a Cmnd_List
    was not being honored.
  * No longer produce a parse error when #includedir references
    a directory that contains no valid filenames.
  * The sudo.man.pl and sudoers.man.pl files are now included
    in the distribution for people who wish to regenerate the man pages.

  * When authenticating via PAM, set PAM_RUSER and PAM_RHOST early
    so they can be used during authentication.
  * Fix printing of entries with multiple host entries on
    a single line.
  * Fix use after free when sending error messages via email.
  * Use setrlimit64(), if available, instead of setrlimit()

  * Fix size arg when realloc()ing include stack.
  * Avoid a duplicate fclose() of the sudoers file.
  * Fix a bug that could allow users with permission to run sudoedit
    to run arbitrary commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 26 22:48:31 CET 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- SPARC requires large PIE model

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 13 14:43:20 CEST 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 1.7.2
  * A new #includedir directive is available in sudoers.  This can be
    used to implement an /etc/sudo.d directory.  Files in an includedir
    are not edited by visudo unless they contain a syntax error.
  * The -g option did not work properly when only setting the group
    (and not the user).  Also, in -l mode the wrong user was displayed
    for sudoers entries where only the group was allowed to be set.
  * Fixed a problem with the alias checking in visudo which
    could prevent visudo from exiting.
  * Sudo will now correctly parse the shell-style /etc/environment
    file format used by pam_env on Linux.
  * When doing password and group database lookups, sudo will only
    cache an entry by name or by id, depending on how the entry was
    looked up.  Previously, sudo would cache by both name and id
    from a single lookup, but this breaks sites that have multiple
    password or group database names that map to the same uid or
    gid.
  * User and group names in sudoers may now be enclosed in double
    quotes to avoid having to escape special characters.
  * BSM audit fixes when changing to a non-root uid.
  * Experimental non-Unix group support.  Currently only works with
    Quest Authorization Services and allows Active Directory groups
    fixes for Minix-3.
  * For Netscape/Mozilla-derived LDAP SDKs the certificate and key
    paths may be specified as a directory or a file.  However, version
    5.0 of the SDK only appears to support using a directory (despite
    documentation to the contrary).  If SSL client initialization
    fails and the certificate or key paths look like they could be
    default file name, strip off the last path element and try again.
  * A setenv() compatibility fix for Linux systems, where a NULL
    value is treated the same as an empty string and the variable
    name is checked against the NULL pointer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 27 17:37:00 CEST 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 1.7.1
  * A new Defaults option "pwfeedback" will cause sudo to provide visual
    feedback when the user is entering a password.
  * A new Defaults option "fast_glob" will cause sudo to use the fnmatch()
    function for file name globbing instead of glob().  When this option
    is enabled, sudo will not check the file system when expanding wildcards.
    This is faster but a side effect is that relative paths with wildcard
    will no longer work.
  * The file name specified with the #include directive may now include
    a %h escape which is expanded to the short form of hostname.
  * The -k flag may now be specified along with a command, causing the
    user's timestamp file to be ignored.
  * The unused alias checks in visudo now handle the case of an alias
    referring to another alias.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 26 13:54:15 CET 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 1.7.0
  * Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
    This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
    apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command. It
    also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.
  * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of
    other sudoers-format files.
  * Sudo's -l (list) flag has been enhanced:
    o applicable Defaults options are now listed
    o a command argument can be specified for testing whether a user may run
      a specific command.
    o a new -U flag can be used in conjunction with sudo -l to allow root
      (or a user with sudo ALL) to list another user's privileges.
  * A new -g flag has been added to allow the user to specify a primary group
    to run the command as. The sudoers syntax has been extended to include
    a group section in the Runas specification.
  * A uid may now be used anywhere a username is valid.
  * The secure_path run-time Defaults option has been restored.
  * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.
  * The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
    configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.
  * visudo will now warn about aliases that are defined but not used.
  * The -i and -s command line flags now take an optional command to be run
    via the shell. Previously, the argument was passed to the shell as
    a script to run.
  * Improved LDAP support. SASL authentication may now be used in conjunction
    when connecting to an LDAP server. The krb5_ccname parameter in ldap.conf
    may be used to enable Kerberos.
  * Support for /etc/nsswitch.conf. LDAP users may now use nsswitch.conf
    to specify the sudoers order. E.g.:

        sudoers: ldap files

    to check LDAP, then /etc/sudoers. The default is files, even when LDAP
    support is compiled in. This differs from sudo 1.6 where LDAP was always
    consulted first.
  * Support for /etc/environment on AIX and Linux. If sudo is run with the -i
    flag, the contents of /etc/environment are used to populate the new
    environment that is passed to the command being run.
  * Sudo now ignores user .ldaprc files as well as system LDAP defaults.
    All LDAP configuration is now in /etc/ldap.conf (or whichever file was
    specified by configure's --with-ldap-conf-file option). If you are using
    TLS, you may now need to specify:

        tls_checkpeer no

    in sudo's ldap.conf unless ldap.conf references a valid certificate
    authority file(s).
  * If no terminal is available or if the new -A flag is specified, sudo
    will use a helper program to read the password if one is configured.
    Typically, this is a graphical password prompter such as ssh-askpass.
  * A new Defaults option, "mailfrom" that sets the value of the "From:"
    field in the warning/error mail. If unspecified, the login name of
    the invoking user is used.
  * Resource limits are now set to the default value for the user the command
    is being run as on AIX systems.
  * A new Defaults option, "env_file" that refers to a file containing
    environment variables to be set in the command being run.
  * A new -n flag is available which may be used to indicate that sudo should
    not prompt the user for a password and, instead, exit with an error if
    authentication is required.
  * A new Defaults option, "sudoers_locale" that can be used to set the locale
    to be used when parsing the sudoers file.
  * sudoedit now checks the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables to make sure
    sudoedit is not re-invoking itself (or sudo). This allows one to set EDITOR
    to sudoedit without getting into an infinite loop for programs that need
    to invoke an editor such as crontab(1). Also added SUDO_EDITOR environment
    variable which is used by sudoedit in preference to EDITOR/VISUAL.
  * The versions of glob(3) and fnmatch(3) bundled with sudo now support POSIX
    character classes.
  * If sudo needs to prompt for a password and it is unable to disable echo
    (and no askpass program is defined), it will refuse to run unless the
    "visiblepw" Defaults option has been specified.
  * Prior to version 1.7.0, hitting enter/return at the Password: prompt would
    exit sudo. In sudo 1.7.0 and beyond, this is treated as an empty password.
    To exit sudo, the user must now press ^C or ^D at the prompt.

    mutually exclusive.
  * Fixed the configure test for dirfd() under Linux.
  * Fixed test for whether -lintl is required to link.
  * Changed how sudo handles the child process when sending mail.
    This fixes a problem on Linux with the mail_always option.
  * Fixed a problem with line continuation characters inside of
    quoted strings.

- updated to 1.6.9p16
  * There was a missing space before the ldap libraries in the Makefile
    for some configurations.
  * LDAPS_PORT may not be defined on older Solaris LDAP SDKs.
  * If the LDAP server could not be contacted and the user was not present
    in sudoers, a syntax error in sudoers was incorrectly reported.

  * Fixed a compilation problem on SCO related to how they
    store the high resolution timestamps in struct stat.
  * Avoid checking the passwd file group multiple times
    in the LDAP query when the user's passwd group is also
    listed in the supplemental group vector.
  * The URI specifier can now be used in ldap.conf even when
    the LDAP SDK doesn't support ldap_initialize().
  * New %p prompt escape that expands to the user whose password
    is being prompted, as specified by the rootpw, targetpw and
    runaspw sudoers flags.  Based on a diff from Patrick Schoenfeld.
  * Added a configure check for the ber_set_option() function.
  * Fixed a compilation problem with the HP-UX K&R C compiler.
  * Revamped the Kerberos 5 ticket verification code.
  * Added support for the checkpeer ldap.conf variable for
    netscape-based LDAP SDKs.
  * Fixed a problem where an incomplete password could be echoed
    to the screen if there was a read timeout.
  * Sudo will now set the nproc resource limit to unlimited on Linux
    systems to work around Linux's setuid() resource limit semantics.
    On PAM systems the resource limits will be reset by pam_limits.so
    before the command is executed.
  * SELinux support that can be used to implement role based access
    control (RBAC).  A role and (optional) type may be specified
    in sudoers or on the command line.  These are then used in the
    security context that the command is run as.
  * Fixed a Kerberos 5 compilation problem with MIT Kerberos.
  * Fixed an invalid assumption in the PAM conversation function
    introduced in version 1.6.9p9.  The conversation function may
    be called for non-password reading purposes as well.
  * Fixed freeing an uninitialized pointer in -l mode, introduced in
    version 1.6.9p13.
  * Check /etc/sudoers after LDAP even if the user was found in LDAP.
    This allows Defaults options in /etc/sudoers to take effect.
  * Add missing checks for enforcing mode in SELinux RBAC mode.
