  <title>Execute some commands as root</title>
  <description>Sudo is a command that allows users to execute some commands as root.
The /etc/sudoers file (edited with 'visudo') specifies which users have
access to sudo and which commands they can run. Sudo logs all its
activities to syslogd, so the system administrator can keep an eye on
things. Sudo asks for the password for initializing a check period of a
given time N (where N is defined at installation and is set to 5
minutes by default).</description>
