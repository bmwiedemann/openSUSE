In the default (ie unconfigured) configuration sudo asks for root password.
This allows to use an ordinary user account for administration of a freshly
installed system. When configuring sudo, please make sure to delete the two
following lines:

Defaults targetpw    # ask for the password of the target user i.e. root
%users ALL=(ALL) ALL # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!
