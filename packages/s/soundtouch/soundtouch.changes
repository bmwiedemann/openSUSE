Sun Feb 18 06:38:58 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.0
  * Added functions to get initial processing latency, duration
    ratio between the original input and processed output tracks,
    and clarified reporting of input/output batch sizes
  * Fixed issue that added brief sequence of silence to beginning
    of output audio
  * Adjusted algorithm parameters to reduce reverberating effect
    at tempo slowdown
  * Bugfix: Fixed a glitch that could cause negative array indexing
    in quick seek algorithm
  * Bugfix: flush() didn't properly flush final samples from the
    pipeline on 2nd time in case that soundtouch object instance
    was recycled and used for processing a second audio stream.
  * Bugfix: Pi value had incorrect 9th/10th decimals
  * Added C# example application that uses SoundTouch dll library
    for processing MP3 files
- includes 1.9.2:
  * Fix in GNU package configuration
- includes 1.9.1:
  * Improved SoundTouch::flush() function so that it returns
    precisely the desired amount of samples for exact output
    duration control
  * Redesigned quickseek algorithm for improved sound quality when
    using the quickseek mode. The new quickseek algorithm can find
    99% as good results as the default full-scan mode, while the
    quickseek algorithm is remarkable less CPU intensive.
  * Added adaptive integer divider scaling for improved sound
    quality when using integer processing algorithm
- includes 1.9:
  * Added support for parallel computation support via OpenMP
    primitives for better performance in multicore systems.
    Benchmarks show that achieved parallel processing speedup
    improvement typically range from +30% (x86 dual-core) to +180%
    (ARM quad-core). The OpenMP optimizations are disabled by
    default, see OpenMP notes above in this readme file how to
    enabled these optimizations.
  * Android: Added support for Android devices featuring X86 and
    MIPS CPUs, in addition to ARM CPUs.
  * Android: More versatile Android example application that
    processes WAV audio files with SoundTouch library
  * Replaced Windows-like 'BOOL' types with native 'bool'
  * Changed documentation token to "dist_doc_DATA" in Makefile.am
  * Miscellaneous small fixes and improvements
- cleanup with spec-cleaner
- other spec fixes:
  * switch to https
  * link directly to man page taken from debian, and refresh it
  * macroify sover, bump from 0 to 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 16:32:26 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.8.0
  * Added support for multi-channel audio processing
  * Added support for cubic and shannon interpolation for rate and
    pitch shift effects besides the original linear interpolation, 
    to reduce aliasing at high frequencies due to interpolation. 
    Cubic interpolation is used as default for floating point processing,
    and linear interpolation for integer processing.
  * Fixed bug in anti-alias filtering that limited stop-band attenuation 
    to -10 dB instead of <-50dB, and increased filter length from 32 to 64
    taps to further reduce aliasing due to frequency folding.
  * Performance improvements in cross-correlation algorithm
  * Other bug and compatibility fixes
- Remove obsolete AUTHORS and %clean sections

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 25 21:39:25 CET 2013 - sbrabec@suse.cz

    match better with ideal duration
  * Rewrote x86 cpu feature check to resolve compatibility problems
  * Configure script automatically checks if CPU supports mmx & sse
    compatibility for GNU platform, and the script support now
    "--enable-x86-optimizations" switch to allow disabling
    x86-specific optimizations.
  * Revised #define conditions for 32bit/64bit compatibility
  * gnu autoconf/automake script compatibility fixes
  * Tuned beat-per-minute detection algorithm
- Updated man page from Debian unstable.

Wed Aug 10 22:23:19 UTC 2011 - ampsaltis@gmail.com

- New upstream version 1.6.0.
- Changes: 
  * Added automatic cutoff threshold adaptation to beat detection
     routine to better adapt BPM calculation to different types of
     music
  * Retired 3DNow! optimization support as 3DNow! is nowadays
     obsoleted and assembler code is nuisance to maintain
  * Retired "configure" file from source code package due to
     autoconf/automake versio conflicts, so that it is from now on to
     be generated by invoking "boostrap" script that uses locally
     available toolchain version for generating the "configure" file
  * Resolved namespace/label naming conflicts with other libraries by
     replacing global labels such as INTEGER_SAMPLES with more
     specific SOUNDTOUCH_INTEGER_SAMPLES etc.
  * Updated windows build scripts & project files for Visual Studio
     2008 support
  * Updated SoundTouch.dll API for .NET compatibility
  * Added API for querying nominal processing input & output sample
     batch sizes
