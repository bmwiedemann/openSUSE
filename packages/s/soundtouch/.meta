  <title>Audio Processing Library</title>
  <description>SoundTouch is an open source audio processing library that allows
changing the sound tempo, pitch and playback rate parameters
independently from each other.
*Easy-to-use implementation of time-stretch, pitch-shift and sample
 rate transposing routines.
*High-performance object-oriented C++ implementation.
*Clear and easy-to-use programming interface via a single C++ class.
*Supported audio data format : 16Bit integer or 32bit floating point
 PCM mono/stereo
*Capable of real-time audio stream processing:
 input/output latency max. ~ 100 ms.
 Processing 44.1kHz/16bit stereo sound in realtime requires a 133 Mhz
 Intel Pentium processor or better.
*Additional assembler-level and Intel-MMX instruction set optimizations
 for Intel x86 compatible processors, offering several times increase
 in the processing performance.</description>
