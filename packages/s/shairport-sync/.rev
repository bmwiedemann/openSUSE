    <comment>- Really use upstream tarball from the source url

- Update to release 3.2.2
  Version 3.2 introduces two big new features – MPRIS support and a &quot;native&quot; Shairport
  Sync D-Bus interface. MPRIS offers a standard set of facilities for implementing remote
  control and the native D-Bus interface allows local programs to interact
  directly with Shairport Sync.
  When used with either of these interfaces, Shairport Sync offers access
  to the remote control commands available to control the source, and also
  offers access to metadata, including titles and cover art. These new features
  are experimental, but are already useful.
  This release of Shairport Sync contains important bug fixes and stability
  improvements and is recommended for all users. If offers better synchronisation,
  better compatibility with third-party AirPlay sources, greater stability when
  used with YouTube and macOS system sound, faster resynchronisation, better
  performance on noisy or congested networks and many other improvements.
  A quick INSTALL guide for the Raspberry Pi, a how-to CAR INSTALL guide and
  a note about installing to OpenBSD have been added.

    <comment>- Transform bash-specific sh code to POSIX sh in scriptlets.
- Do not hide errors from useradd.
- Reduce hard scriptlet dependency on systemd;
  %service_* does not need it. (forwarded request 686235 from jengelh)</comment>

    <comment>- Update version to 3.3.1
  * Fix a bug in the MQTT documentation and add sanity checking for the port
    chosen -- thanks to David Crook.
  * Fix a bug that caused manual format and rate settings to be ignored --
    thanks to Jörg Krause.
  * Add missing support for format settings S24_LE, S24_BE, S32_LE and S32_BE.
  * Fix a bug that caused dither to be too loud.
  * Fix error message for invalid 
  * Automatic Format and Speed Selection for alsa devices. Using the alsa back
    end, when you specify the output device, Shairport Sync will now, by
    default, select the best output format and speed. For instance, if your
    output device is capable of 32-bit operation, it will be selected. In some
    situations, this will give a noticeable improvement in sound quality – see
    the discussion of audio improvements below. The greatest bit depth will
    always be selected, and the lowest speed that is a multiple of 44,100.
  * Audio Transient Reduction: A Disable Standby feature to eliminate certain
    faint-but-annoying audible pops and clicks has been added for alsa devices.
    The setting prevents an output device entering standby mode and thus
    minimises standby/busy transitions, which can sometimes be heard. It is
    pretty impressive, especially combined with fixes to the dithering code
    described below. If you can enable 24- or 32-bit audio output to your output
    device, you can get even better results. This feature is available in the
    ALSA back end (standard in Linux) when it is driving output devices that can
    provide precision delay information, i.e. most hardware output devices and
    possibly some virtual devices.
  * New active/inactive program hooks. Basically, these are &quot;deglitched&quot;
    replacements for play start/play end program hooks. When a play session
    starts, the system goes active. When the play session ends, the system
    remains active for a period determined by the active_state_timeout setting,
    10 seconds by default. If another play session starts before the period (forwarded request 711702 from hillwood)</comment>
