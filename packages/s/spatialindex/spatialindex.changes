- Rename libspatialindex4 subpackage to libspatialindex6, following
  the actual soname of the libraries shipped.
- Obsolete libspatialindex4 = 1.9.3 by libspatialindex6: help
  zypper for the upgrade case from the wrongly packaged
  libspatialindex4 to libspatialindex6. We obsolete only the
  version that was wrongly packaged, so that actual users
  of libspatialindex.so.4 have a chance to co-exist.
