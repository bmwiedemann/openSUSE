%description
An extensible framework that will support robust spatial indexing methods.

Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, point location, nearest
neighbor and k-nearest neighbor as well as parametric queries (defined by
spatial constraints) should be easy to deploy and run.

Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting and updating information.

Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic index and storage
characteristics like the page size, node capacity, minimum fan-out, splitting
algorithm, etc. should be easy to customize.

Index persistence. Internal memory and external memory structures should be
supported. Clustered and non-clustered indices should be easy to be persisted.

%description -n lib%{name}4
libspatialindex provides a general framework for developing spatial indices.
Currently it defines generic interfaces, provides simple main memory and disk
based storage managers and a robust implementation of an R*-tree, an MVR-tree
and a TPR-tree.
