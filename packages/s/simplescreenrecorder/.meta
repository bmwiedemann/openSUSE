  <title>A feature-rich screen recorder that supports X11 and OpenGL</title>
  <description>SimpleScreenRecorder is a Linux program that was created to record programs and games.

Original goal was to create a program that was just really simple to use, and the result is actually a pretty powerful program. It's 'simple' in the sense that it's easier to use than ffmpeg/avconv or VLC, because it has a straightforward user interface.

Features:
 * Graphical user interface (Qt-based).
 * Faster than VLC and ffmpeg/avconv.
 * Records the entire screen or part of it, or records OpenGL applications
   directly (similar to Fraps on Windows).
 * Synchronizes audio and video properly (a common issue with VLC and ffmpeg/avconv).
 * Reduces the video frame rate if your computer is too slow (rather than
   using up all your RAM like VLC does).
 * Fully multithreaded: small delays in any of the components will never
   block the other components, resulting is smoother video and better
   performance on computers with multiple processors.
 * Pause and resume recording at any time (either by clicking a button or by
   pressing a hotkey).
 * Shows statistics during recording (file size, bit rate, total recording
   time, actual frame rate, ...).
 * Can show a preview during recording, so you don't waste time recording
   something only to figure out afterwards that some setting was wrong.
 * Uses libav/ffmpeg libraries for encoding, so it supports many different
   codecs and file formats (adding more is trivial).
 * Sensible default settings: no need to change anything if you don't want to.
 * Tooltips for almost everything: no </description>
