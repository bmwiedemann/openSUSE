  <title>System Utilities Package / Libsysfs</title>
  <description>This package's purpose is to provide a library for interfacing with the
kernel's sys filesystem mounted at /sys. The library was an attempt to
create a stable interface to sysfs, but it failed. It is still provided
for the current users, but no new software should use this library.</description>
