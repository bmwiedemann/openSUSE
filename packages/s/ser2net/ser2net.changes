Sun Jan 23 15:53:49 UTC 2022 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- ser2net 4.3.5:
  * Yet another quick release. gcc-11 and the new sctp library
    threw some curve balls, so those needed to be handled.

    the new compiler and library.

    that I finally tracked down. Nothing major, but upgrading is
    recommended.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 21:11:05 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.2.2
  * Add user lists, so you can specify which users are allowed to
    use which connections.
  * Split up dataxfer.c into smaller files, since it was far too
    large.
  * Converted to SPDX license identifiers in the files.
  * tcpd on the controller interface had the wrong name, make it
    the same as the 3.5 release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  9 14:31:22 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.2.1
  controller:
  * Added a yaml mode for the controller interface. This should
    make having a program talk to the controller much easier.
  * In yaml mode for the controller interface, add asychronous
    notifications to know if anything connects or disconnects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  8 18:53:31 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.2.0
  telnet:
  * There was an issue with telnet handling where it could get
    into a loop talking to the remote end.
  * Fix an issue where an error in a certain place could cause
    closing to hang.
  selector:
    Allow an arbitrary number of file descriptors with epoll. With
    epoll, you can set the max number of fds > FD_SETSIZE. Allow
    that.
  IPv6:
  * There was a bug in the Linux SCTP stack dealing with IPv6
    handling that I thought was a bug in ser2net. So I looked, and
    I found some issues with IPv6 in general and the way it handles
    IPv4 address mapping. In the new code:
    Modify the operation of an address without "ipv6," explicitly
    in front of it to all V4 mapped addresses. And fix the connect
    side to set V6 only on the socket if "ipv6,"is in front of it.
    This means you cannot mix "ipv6," and "ipv6n4," addresses on
    the same connection, and the default is now "ipv6n4"
    This broke handling of things like "tcp,1234", so rework those
    to only use IPv6 when it is mapped. That, in turn, broke UDP.
    Or, more accurately, expose a UDP bug, so some work had to be
    done to handle IPv4 mapped addresses in IPv6 by reworking
    address comparison to handle that.
  general:
    convert gensio_raddr_to_str(), gensio_get_raddr(), and 
    gensio_remote_id() to use gensio_control(). Having separate
    functions for those added to the API and added a lot of code
    to all the intermediate layer. The function are there but
    deprecated, and use the ioctls underneath them.
    Have gensio snprint functions return a gensiods
    Add dll visibililty handling. This is required for windows,
    and makes things cleaner. As part of this, functions should
    all be the right visibility now.
    Lots of other little bug fixes and such.
  relpkt:
    There were issues with the way the base code handled certain
    things. For a real protocol that might have outstanding data
    to send but cannot send due to flow control, new functions
    needs to be added to the base layer to account for this, and
    relpkt needed to use them.
    Fixed several other issues dealing with close handling and flow
    control. It runs much better now.
  msgdelim:
    There was an issue with telnet handling where it could get into
    a loop talking to the remote end.
    Fix an issue where an error in a certain place could cause
    closing to hang.
  file descriptor based gensios:
    Fixed an issue that would result in a callback being done after
    close is compelete.
  UDP:
    As part of an added test, I found a situation where if the
    upper layer doesn't accept the data for a UDP packet, the UDP
    layer would not accept any more data from the socket.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 16 14:56:56 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.1.8
  * ser2net will now retry accepters and connect back connectors
    if they fail to come up or get an error.

  * Allow stdin to be read as a yaml config file.
  * Allow yaml config to be passed in on the command line directly.
  * Fix some issues with connect back handling.
  * A host of other smaller things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 01:37:22 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.10.0
  * utils.c, controller.c, dataxfer.c: Return an errno from
	scan_tcp_port() so it can return an out of memory error.
  * controller.c, controller.h, ser2net.c: Add an out of memory
	return code from controller_init().
  * utils.c, utils.h, dataxfer.c, controller.c: Rework the handling
	of addresses to work properly with all the return values of
	getaddrinfo, and to prefer IPV6 over IPV4 when opening the socket.
	This means if you specify a number, it will open the IPV6 ::,port
	address first.  This was a big cleanup, and moved a lot of the
	base socket handling into utils.h.
  * dataxfer.c: Rework the stdio handling so it doesn't rely on the
	port number in the address, since that is now gone.
  * dataxfer.c: Set port->closestr to NULL when freeing it to avoid
	a double-free.
  * readconfig.c, ser2net.8: Rework the input handling so an IPV6
	can be specified as part of the portnum parameter.  This was hard
	because IPV6 addresses have ':' in them.  Basically, if there is a
	"," in the port specification, assume that everything from the
	beginning of the line to the ':' after the ',' is the port number.
  * utils.c, utils.h, dataxfer.c, controller.c: Modified address
	handling so that ser2net opens all the addresses returned by
	getaddrinfo, not just the first one.  That should make things
	work correctly in a lot more cases.
  * io.h, devcfg.h, devcfg.c, dataxfer.c, buffer.c, buffer.h: Abstract
	the device I/O operations.
  * utils.c, utils.h, controller.h, controller.c: Fix some const
	correctness issues
  * conroller.c, controller.h: Add printf-style output.
  * dataxfer.h, dataxfer.c, devcfg.h, devcfg.c, io.h, readconfig:
	Rework the error and output handling to make it more flexible, so
	errors can be output with useful information from the lower
  * utils.h, readconfig.c, dataxfer.c: Rework the find_xxx
	functions to return a strdup of the string.
  * dataxfer.c, dataxfer.h, devcfg.h: Remove the dinfo structure
	and move the contents into the port structure, and remove the
	now empty devcfg.h.
  * configure.ac: Minor rework.
  * ser2net.h, Makefile.am: Move some things into a new
	ser2net.h file.
  * devcfg.c, controller.c, dataxfer.c, ser2net.c, utils.c: Add the
	ser2net.h include file.
  * dataxfer.c: Fix some EAGAIN handling.
