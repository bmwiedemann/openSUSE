- rewrote spec file to account for SeaMonkey's new build system, including
  a new Makefile from Dmitry Butskoy: #1181525#c3
- merged the translations-common and translations-other subpackages into

  * Additional important security fixes up to Current Firefox 78.1 ESR
    and a few enhancements have been backported. We will continue to
    enhance SeaMonkey security in subsequent 2.53.x beta and release
    versions as fast as we are able to.
- Added patch seamonkey-lto.patch which corrects the LTO syntax
  when compiling with GCC

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 09:35:49 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- requested inclusion in Leap 15.1 and 15.2:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1174300

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 20:49:18 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- update appdata files (Bug 1174192):
  * correct metadata licensing information (most of the application
    descriptions had been taken from
    https://www.seamonkey-project.org/doc/features which according to
    the page footer is licensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0)
  * update the metadata summary and the introduction in the metadata
    description to more accurately reflect what SeaMonkey is, giving
    less prominence to the long-discontinued Mozilla Application Suite
    that many users may no longer be familiar with
  * update the metadata name to more accurately reflect the name
    or purpose of the application
  * update the metadata URL with the current SeaMonkey website

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 15 12:09:03 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- update to SeaMonkey 2.53.3
  * The LaTex tool TexZilla, used for inserting Math, has been
    upgraded to 1.0.2.
  * It is now possible to customize the toolbars in Composer and the
    formatting toolbar in Mailnews composition.
  * All folders of an account can now be marked as read.
  * There is now an option for not advertizing SeaMonkey at all in the
    user agent.
  * The preference for hiding the toolbar and menubar grippies can now
    be changed from "Preferences->Appearance".
  * The preference "browser.tabs.autoHide" which autohides the tab bar
    when there is only one tab in a browser window open has been
    flipped in bug 1634879. SeaMonkey will now show the tab bar as the
    default. You can change it back by checking "Hide the tab bar when
    only one tab is open" in "Preferences->Browser->Tabbed Browsing"
  * Update of help page content and links.
  * SeaMonkey language packs are now version specific and will be
    disabled as part of the profile upgrade following the installation
    of a later version.
  * Search Engines have been centralized and updated in bug 1300198.
  * Address book now has updated IM fields, improved layout for card
    view pane, improved multi-word search, ability to search across
    multiple address books, more granular prompts when deleting items,
    print on the context menus and print button on the toolbar.
  * Multimedia support has been updated in preparation of supporting
    more audio video formats in the next releases. For enhanced
    security the Rust multimedia parser is now used for this and the
    libstagefright package has been removed.
  * SeaMonkey 2.53.3 uses the same backend as Firefox and contains the
    relevant Firefox 60.4 security fixes.
  * SeaMonkey 2.53.3 shares most parts of the mail and news code with
    Thunderbird. Please read the Thunderbird 60.0 release notes for
    specific changes and security fixes in this release.
  * Additional important security fixes up to Current Firefox 77 and a
    few enhancements have been backported.
- Fix exclusion list syntax in create-tars.sh script
- Disable LTO on i586 builds as these are once again failing due to

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 02 13:00:57 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- Re-enable LTO on Tumbleweed builds after increasing available

  build.opensuse.org:
  https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1171414

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 08 09:55:00 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

  VCS files; the previous exclusion list would have eventually
  triggered the bug at
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1621564

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 07 14:21:31 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- update to SeaMonkey 2.53.2
  https://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.53.2/
  * Scrollbars have been switched over to the native gtk3 theme in bug
    1625754. If your theme does not show scrollbar buttons and you
    would like to see them try editing ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and
    adding the following:
        {
          -GtkScrollbar-has-backward-stepper: 1;
          -GtkScrollbar-has-forward-stepper: 1;
        }
  * The download progress dialog has been fixed and is now showing the
    correct status for downloads. Some downloads may not show the
    transferred count. This problem is under investigation.
  * SeaMonkey is now translated and available in Finnish and Georgian.
  * Because of website compatibility issues and privacy concerns the
    Lightning version is no longer appended to the user agent string
    and has been removed from the preferences dialog.
  * Advanced Layers has been activated on Windows. This should boost
    performance on some websites. If you experience graphics problems
    please disable it by setting the pref "layers.mlgpu.enabled" to
    false.
  * Whether the native app chooser is used in Linux is now controlled
    via a preference setting in the Helper Applications preference
    pane.
  * In the Modern theme, popup notifications have improved styling and
    column headers now display sort direction arrows.
  * The column picker and folder view have been reinstated for the
    bookmarks panel.
  * Introduced the ability to close all tabs to the right of the
    current tab.
  * Whether mailnews tabs open in the background is controlled by a
    separate preference to browser tabs via General Settings section
    of main Mail & Newsgroups preference pane.
  * Fixed an issue with the recipient being missing when using Reply
    to Sender and Group button in Newsgroup discussions.
  * SeaMonkey now prevents address books from having duplicate names.
  * SeaMonkey 2.53.2 uses the same backend as Firefox and contains
    the relevant Firefox 60.3 security fixes. 
  * SeaMonkey 2.53.2 shares most parts of the mail and news code with
    Thunderbird. Please read the Thunderbird 60.0 release notes for
    specific changes and security fixes in this release.
  * SeaMonkey now uses gtk3 on Linux. If you experience a problem
    because of this please file a bug and link it to bug
    1367257. Please try another OS theme first. Some of them are buggy
    and cause problems with SeaMonkey, Thunderbird and Firefox.
- Remove obsolete upstream and local patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 05 12:37:11 UTC 2020 - Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

- update to SeaMonkey 2.53.1
  https://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.53.1/
  * The Bookmarks Manager has switched its name to Library, and now
    also includes the History list. When invoking History, the Library
    will be shown with the History list selected. The extensive
    modifications were needed because of Mozilla Gecko platform API
    changes.
  * Download Manager has been migrated to a new API. Although it looks
    pretty much the same as before, the search option is missing and
    some other minor details work differently. The previous downloads
    history is removed during the upgrade.
  * Added Layout panel to CSS Grid tools.
  * TLS 1.3 is the default version now.
  * Among the general platform and mail fixes this release contains
    backported fixes from Thunderbird for the EFAIL security
    vulnerability.
  * SeaMonkey now uses gtk3 on Linux. If you experience a problem
    because of this please file a bug and link it to Switch Linux
    builds to GTK3 with SeaMonkey 2.49. Please try another OS theme
    first. Some of them are buggy and cause problems with SeaMonkey,
    Thunderbird and Firefox.
  * The Lightning extension is now included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
