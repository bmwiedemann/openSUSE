Subject: [PATCH 04/11] strip the domain part from /etc/hostname when setting
 system host name

[fbui: fixes bnc#820213]
[fbui: forwardported from bfd2462b8ddec591d953841ab22bb30bdc6f9085]
[fbui: adjust context and make sure that strip of the domain name is
       only done when setting the system host name. Therefore it's
       still possible to pass an FQDN to hostnamectl]
[fbui: I'm still not sure that it was the right thing to do. Other
       possibility was to fix the installer to create a correct
       /etc/hostname file. Need to investigate...]
