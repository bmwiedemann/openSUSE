# This is not about authentication per se (user@.service is a system
# service anyway) but to give the possibility to user services
# (especially those like gnome-terminal, see [1]) to have theirs
# credentials extended similar to the ones received by a user when he
# logs in (and the full PAM authentication stack is run). See [2] and
# [3] for details.
