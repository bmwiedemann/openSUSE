Subject: [PATCH 11/12] core: disable session keyring per system sevice
 entirely for now

Until PAM module "pam_keyinit" is fully integrated in SUSE's PAM stack, this
feature has to be disabled.

openSUSE is still not ready for enabling the keyring stuff (see
bsc#1081947). Some services got fixed (sshd, getty@.service) but some still
haven't (xdm, login, ...)

So leave it disabled again otherwise different users might end up using the
same session keyring - the one created for the service used for logging in
(sshd, getty@.service, xdm, etc...)

The integration of pam_keyinit is tracked here:
https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1081947
