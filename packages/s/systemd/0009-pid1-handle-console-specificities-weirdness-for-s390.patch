Subject: [PATCH 09/12] pid1: handle console specificities/weirdness for s390
 arch

The 3270 console on S/390 can do color but not the 3215 console.

Partial forward port of
0001-On_s390_con3270_disable_ANSI_colour_esc.patch from SLE12-SP1. A
bunch of the previous code has been dropped since some changes
imported from upsteam made them uneeded.

The remaining bits are probably hackish but at least they are now
minimal.

It was an attempt to address bnc#860937. And yes turning the console
color mode off by passing $TERM=dumb via the kernel command line would
have been much more easier and enough.

This is actually implemented by recent systemd. There's also another
command line option: systemd.log_color=off.

See also a short discussion which happened on @systemd-maintainers
whose $subject is "[PATCH] support conmode setting on command line".
