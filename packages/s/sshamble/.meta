  <title>Security testing toolset for SSH</title>
  <description>SSHamble simulates potential attack scenarios, including
unauthorized remote access due to unexpected state transitions,
remote command execution in post-session login implementations
and information leakage through unlimited high-speed authentication
requests.

The SSHamble interactive shell provides raw access to SSH requests in
the post-session (but pre-execution) environment, allowing for simple
esting of environment controls, signal processing, port forwarding,
and more.</description>
