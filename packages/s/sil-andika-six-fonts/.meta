  <title>Sans serif, Unicode-compliant Font For Literacy Use</title>
  <description>Andika Six is renamed version of Andika v6.200 with no other
changes. Andika version 7 includes metrics changes that
could cause lines, paragraphs, and pages to reflow. Because
of this we wanted to provide a font that reproduced the
exact metrics and behavior of Andika v6.200 and could be
installed at the same time as the newest Andika (v7 and beyond).
Andika v7 is still the best font for most people to use.
But if you have documents prepared with Andika v6.200 and
need to preserve the spacing, you can install Andika Six,
change the doc to use it instead of Andika, and avoid any
issues with reflow. Then you can use Andika v7 for new
documents and benefit from the many improvements in this and
future versions.</description>
