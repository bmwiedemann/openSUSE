  * bind to the specified source address with for all udp6 sockets used
    with udp-sport ping method.
  * finalize task signatures for ping, trace, udpprobe, and dealias
    immediately before tasks begin probing to provide more ability for
    parallel measurements to the same destinations.
 * python module:
  * correct bugs in documentation
  * add to_json() to all measurement types where there's a scamper json
    rendering
 * libscamperfile:
  * fix memory leaks on malformed warts input
  * add scamper_*_tojson functions for dealias, host, ping, tbit, trace,
    tracelb, and udpprobe
  * move Makefile rules for libscamperfile from scamper/Makefile.am into
    lib/libscamperfile/Makefile.am
 * sc_speedtrap:
  * add -R /path/to/socket to enable speedtrap to use a remote scamper
    instance
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
  * update man page with documentation
 * configure:
  * add --disable-utils and --disable-libs options to configure, to control
    how much of the scamper package is actually built.
  * update to serial 37 of ax_python_devel.m4 and serial 8 of
    ax_gcc_builtin.m4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 23 07:17:26 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

* update to version 20240920:
 * scamper:
  * add -O noring to disable use of ring buffer on Linux when
    scamper is configured with --enable-scamper-ring
  * udpprobe: add -S src parameter, update manual page with
    previously supported but undocumented options
 * sc_prefixprober:
  * allow do-not-probe list to be embedded in the input set of
    prefixes to probe, update manual page.
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the sc_prefixprober
    utility came from
 * Python module:
  * add src parameter to ScamperCtrl.do_udpprobe
* update to version 20240916:
 * scamper:
  * with ping -F 0 and trace -s 0, choose a different TCP or UDP source
    port if an otherwise available source port has been used in the past
    5 seconds to the same destination IP and port.
  * ping: add udp-sport probe method
  * ping: refactor udp packet matching on datalink sockets
  * allow -D when outputting to a file.
  * use SO_TIMESTAMP on linux packet sockets, rather than call an ioctl,
    to fix buggy linux timestamps when not using ring
  * rework privsep code to be signal aware, and forward signals from
    scamper's privileged process to scamper's unprivileged process via
    the socketpair between the processes.  i.e.,
    scamper -D -U /path/to/scamper-unix-socket -e /path/to/scamper.pid
    kill -HUP `cat /path/to/scamper.pid`
    now works.  TERM and INT also propagate from privileged to
    unprivileged process.  this allows the user that started scamper to
    send signals to the privileged process, which it then forwards to
    unprivileged process.  the user who started scamper is otherwise not
    able to send the unprivileged process signals, as that process
    typically runs as user nobody.
  * host: add -O nsid to signal queried server to include nsid OPT
    record in response.  parse any server-provided OPT records.
  * udpprobe: record ifname replies were received on
  * udpprobe: increase supported probe size from 1000 to 1400 bytes.
  * factor out most repeated tls code patterns into utils_tls.c
  * add functions to utils_tls.c to load key material from opened
    file descriptors, to allow key material to be reloaded in
    unprivileged process
  * reload TLS key material on HUP signal
  * do not negotiate use of TLS v1.1
  * refactor privsep code to make it obvious which functions belong to
    which process, and develop an obvious pattern in the code.
  * make route socket interface work on NetBSD again
  * tracelb: fix sport validation
  * other minor code cleanups
 * sc_minrtt:
  * thread input stage, add batch import.  by default, sc_minrtt
    will import N files per batch, where N is the number of processors
    online.
  * add -b batchc parameter that allows for batch size to be adjusted
    according to what is appropriate for the system
  * set exit status to zero when import is successful
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
  * refactor code in places
 * libscamperfile:
  * bump version to account for added interfaces for udpprobe, host
    objects.
 * Python module:
  * add nsid option to ScamperCtrl.do_dns method
  * add ScamperUdpprobeReply.ifname attribute
  * add OPT glue to ScamperHost, and related features
    (udpsize, edns_version, edns_do attributes)
  * add context manager support to ScamperFile and ScamperCtrl, allowing
    for Python with / as syntax
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * change -v vp-ases option to -V vp-ases
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
 * sc_attach, sc_hoiho, sc_remoted:

Mon Aug 19 07:05:31 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Remove upper bound on Cython, Cython 3 appears to be supported. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 17 08:16:38 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20240716:
 * scamper
  * add -O dl-any option to scamper, which causes scamper to open a
    cooked datalink interface bound to "any" on Linux.  Note that
    scamper's implementation of -O dl-any currently prevents
    transmission of packets on the datalink socket, but this will
    change in the future.
  * add -O dyn-filter option to scamper, which causes scamper to
    dynamically adjust the BPF filter that it configures on a datalink
    socket according to TCP/UDP ports that scamper is using.  this
    option is only available on Linux, and BSD systems with BIOCSETFNR
    (FreeBSD and MacOS).  note that both -O dyn-filter and -O dl-any
    cannot currently be used at the same time, but this will change in
    the future.
  * only raise SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF; some systems (e.g. Linux)
    already have larger socket buffers than scamper's defaults.
  * add -O sockrx to ping, to force ping to receive ICMP responses over
    a regular socket, even when using -O dl (which still records datalink
    transmit timestamps).
  * speed up receiving on datalink sockets by avoiding unnecessary
    memsets and removing unused fields, and adjust BSD, Linux, DLPI code
    to follow similar code patterns.
  * consider both directions for TCP packets on datalink sockets,
    allowing datalink transmit timestamps to be recorded for non TCP-syn
    packets.
  * avoid processing duplicate copies of the same packet on Linux
    loopback interface with datalink sockets.
  * remove "observe" functionality from scamper control socket, as
    signalled over a year ago.  "outfile" and "source" will be removed
    from the control socket in the future.
  * cleanup scamper_dlhdr.[ch], use scamper_dlhdr_t to scamper_probe_t
    instead of its constituent parts.
  * update tbit usage statement in scamper, and manual page, with
    currently supported options
 * python module:
  * use join to assemble command strings for all ScamperCtrl.do_*()
    for orders of magnitude faster command generation
  * implement __richcmp__ for all classes where __eq__, __lt__, etc,
    were previously defined individually
  * if string passed to ScamperAddr is invalid, raise an exception
  * implement ScamperCtrl.do_tbit method, ScamperTbit classes
 * sc_minrtt:
  * add sc_minrtt utility, which takes the output of sc_pinger to
    produce a minimized RTT input file for sc_hoiho.  to build, pass
    --enable-sc_minrtt as well as --with-pcre or --with-pcre2 to
    configure, and have sqlite3 development headers and libraries in
    build environment.
 * tests:
  * more ping and tbit command unit tests
  * split out ARP reply parsing code into dl_parse_arp, add fuzzing cradle.
- update to version 20240725:
 * scamper:
  * add dynamic BPF filters for linux "any" packet interface, allowing
    both -O dyn-filter and -O dl-any.
  * avoid generating debugging statements that won't be emitted, saving
    CPU in the usual scamper operating mode.
  * process dltx timestamps when -N > 1 and tx timestamp is available
    after the response has already arrived
  * don't allow TCP traceroute and -N > 1 because packet matching
    responses from the destination is challenging.
  * use scamper_seteuid_[raise|lower] in scamper when built without
    privsep, rather than use a repeated code pattern.
 * configure:
  * add --enable-scamper-ring to configure to make -O ring the default
 * python module:
  * take account of stop_hop when iterating through traceroute hops,
    add ScamperTrace.stop_hop attribute.
  * add ScamperTrace.addrs() convenience method, which returns unique
    addresses observed in the path
  * add ScamperHost.ans_ptrs() convenience method, which returns the
    text from PTR records in a response
  * update documentation:
    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/python/
 * sc_analysis_dump:
  * drop geolocation code from utility, which was not plumbed into
    configure.
 * tests:
  * add check-ifdef.pl to check for obvious #ifdef bugs
- update to version 20240813:
 * scamper:
  * properly set icmp_id on ICMP probe signature in ping when -F 0.
  * reduce code duplication in scamper_fd.c by replacing fd_udp() and
    fd_tcp() with fd_tcpudp().
  * process IPv6 TCP replies in dealias.
  * simplify BPF logic, support unit testing of dl_filter_compile.
  * fix 20240725 regression to actually call scamper_debug logic for
    datalink packets.
 * python module:
  * raise exception if ScamperCtrl.do_*() is called on a ScamperInst
    that has signalled EOF.
  * add ScamperInst.is_eof() method.
 * configure:
  * check for tcp_timer.h in configure, use if found, to fix check
    for tcp_var.h.
 * sc_pinger, sc_minrtt:
  * support batch probing with radargun primitive.
  * update sc_pinger manual page with batch probing details.
 * tests:
  * silence benign clang static analysis warnings.
  * add more ping command unit tests.
  * add unit_dl_filter_compile to test bpf compiler.
  * enhance check-ifdef.pl to find #define / #ifdef ordering issues,
    make pass through code to adjust header ordering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 06:41:00 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix dependency of libscamperfile-devel: require the new
  libscamperfile9. The last updated bumped the so-version, which
  results in a different package name.
- Drop all obsoletes of libscamperfile9: obsoleting old library
  packages is explicitly not to be done according to the packaging
  guidelines around shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  5 14:11:00 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

* update to version 20240503:
 * scamper:
   * improvements with -N squeries; let -Q send all probes when using -N.
     add -H wait-probe-hop, which specifies the minimum delay between
     probes with the same TTL.  identify the hop that would have caused
     traceroute to stop when not using -N so that a normal traceroute
     path with one hop representing the destination or stopping hop in
     the path is rendered.  in the json output, put extra hops beyond
     the stopping hop into a extra_hops array.
   * make ring-nolocked the default when using -O ring.
   * improvements with udpprobe: provide ability to send multiple copies
     of the same payload, add json output, reuse available UDP sockets
     where possible.
   * consistently set and record the IPv4 tos and IPv6 tclass fields for
     both ping and trace.
   * fix warts.bz2 and warts.xz output, which could previously use all
     available space on the file system.
   * speed up rendering of byte arrays as hex in json output.
   * fix obtaining IPv6 hoplimit on received packets on MacOS.
   * record the name of the interface that received IPv4 and IPv6 ICMP
     responses in ping.
   * add TXT queries to host command; add chaos query class; add
     DNS-over-TCP.
   * fix use of ctype functions according to netbsd (cast all parameters
     to unsigned char).  make pass through use of ctype functions to do
     ctype function calls last in most logical statements.
   * cleanup scamper_file_warts.h so that only necessary struct
     definitions are in that header.
 * libscamperfile:
   * add new functions, bump library version due to udpprobe changes.
 * python library
   * improve the usefulness of the ScamperInstError exceptions
   * let all address parameters to do_() methods also be ScamperAddr
   * support creation of ScamperAddr from bytes objects
   * updates to support new functionality in udpprobe primitive
   * support RR filters on all sections of a DNS response
   * add tx, rx, and rtt attributes to DNS responses
   * add qtype=txt, qclass=chaos, tcp DNS queries, and ScamperHostTxt
     class.
   * add helper method to get ns and txt records out of ans section
     -- ans_nses() and ans_txts()
   * add rx and ifname attributes to ScamperPingReply
   * add ScamperDealiasProbe.is_from_target() method
 * configure:
   * remove obsolete AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL
   * fix net/pfvar.h conditional
 * sc_hoiho:
   * fix crashes in IP and FNU stages so that router name regular
     expression inferences work again.
 * sc_wartscat:
   * fix index into infiles array
 * tests:
   * add tests for string_byte2hex, and json escaping
   * add unit tests for TXT records
   * add fuzzing cradle for host_rr_list
   * in fuzz_cmd cradle, ensure any error strings only contain printable
     characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 19:34:46 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20240229:
  * bugfix: correct SCAMPER_DL_IS_ICMP_TIME_REPLY macro so that scamper
    does not ignore ICMP replies quoting TCP/UDP packets for 1/256
    source port values.
  * bugfixes for -O icmp-rxerr: handle EPOLLERR on linux, try using
    IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT before IPV6_HOPLIMIT for IPv6 udp probing.
  * bugfix: fix possible assertions in dealias, trace, and tracelb code.
  * ping: count UDP replies as from the target
  * trace: correct datalink timestamp adjustments
  * add more specific error messages when a scamper command is not
    accepted, return them over control socket or terminal, as appropriate.
  * scamper_fd_t: refactor fd_addr, fd_sport, fd_dl, fd_ifindex
  * scamper_fd_t: decouple udp4raw/udp4dg from each other.  use udp4dg
    and udp6 sockets in udpprobe primitive, rather than have each
    udpprobe task create its own socket.
  * scamper_fd_t: add methods that return an available open socket for
    probing a given destination without blocking if another task is
    probing the same destination.  use this with ping -F 0 and trace -s 0,
    instead of generating random port values, so that scamper opens
    the minimum number of file descriptors.
  * ping and trace: have -O dl mean to capture transmit and receive
    timestamps from a datalink interface.  add -O raw option so that
    IPv4 TCP probes can be transmitted over a raw socket, to allow transmitted
    TCP packets to be observed on the datalink interface.
  * add memory-mapped ring buffer support (PACKET_RX_RING) for receiving
    packets on datalink sockets on Linux.  enable at scamper runtime
    with -O ring.  contributed by Alistair King.
  ## python module:
  * generate module .c with Cython 0.29.37, to enable module to compile
    with Python 3.11.
  * link against libpython
  * have all time parameters take either a timedelta or float/int.  float/int
    parameters are all seconds.
  * add ScamperInstError exception which identifies the scamper instance
    and includes the error string returned by the instance.
  * reduce copying in methods that return bytes objects
  * add str method for ScamperInst
- reenable python build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  6 09:07:29 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Temporarily disable Python build because of incompatibility with Python 3.11
  Reported upstream, will be fixed in next version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 12:59:00 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Update to version 20240122:
 * scamper
  * fix regression in 20240117 where trace -W 0 (probe as soon as
    there's a response) was not accepted, despite being the default.
    add unit test for this.
  * for trace, improve probe and reply matching of UDP packets
  * fix printing UDP responses to traceroute probes in scamper -O text output
  * for trace section of scamper.1 man page, document -O const-payload,
    and expand documentation for -O dl.
 * python module:
  * ship scamper release with a the C source code pre-generated for the
    python module, so that the build process does not require a cython
    installation.  bootstrap.pl will build the C source code unless told
    not to via --without-cython
  * rename ScamperPing.reply_count to ScamperPing.stop_count, as the
    reply_count attribute meant something different on a ScamperPing
    object than what it means with ScamperDealiasProbe, etc
 * sc_remoted:
  * expand sc_remoted.1 manual page with information about validating
    scamper client TLS certificates, and how to use -M monitor-name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 07:35:36 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20240117:
 - scamper:
  - fix crashes if a task is provided an apparent response, but the task
 -   has not yet sent a packet in ping, sting, tbit, trace, tracelb.
  - find and fix memory leaks in measurement command parsing code via
 -   fuzzing.
  - add udpprobe, http, dealias -m midarest, and dealias -m midardisc methods.
 -   udpprobe and http do not currently have json output methods.
  - remove -d dport, -s sport, and -t ttl dealias parameters.  these
 -   were only valid for mercator, and can be specified in a probedef instead.
  - record size of responses for dealias probes.
  - modify all commands to be able to take human-friendly wait parameters --
 -   e.g. trace -W 0.5s or trace -W 500ms instead of trace -W 50000.
  - support transmitting raw packets on linux ppp interfaces
  - add -b payload-size parameter to ping
 - python interface:
  - add python interface to most of scamper.  building this module requires
 -   cython < 3.0.  to build, use something like:
 -   PYTHON=/path/to/python CYTHON=/path/to/cython ./configure --with-python
  - the documentation for this interface is available at
 -   https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/python/
  - the ubuntu PPA provides python3-scamper, and the FreeBSD port should
 -   hopefully provide py-scamper shortly.  these sources may be useful
 -   for getting the module packaged for other operating systems.
 -   https://launchpad.net/~matthewluckie/+archive/ubuntu/scamper
 - libscamperfile and libscamperctrl:
  - improvements, bump versions
 - tests:
  - many new unit tests and fuzzing cradles for scamper components
 - sc_pinger:
  - add -l limit and -M move-dir options
 - sc_remoted:
  - no need to link against libscamperfile, remove dependency
 - sc_attach, sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_wartsfix:
  - compile / link on windows.

    probes for traceroute on windows; provide "attach" support on
    windows.
  * fix compile-on-FreeBSD-15+ where pf firewall does not have
    DIOCGETSTATUS ioctl
  * in scamper's remote control (-R option), fix file descriptor leak
    when unable to reconnect to the remote controller.
  * add --disable-scamper-trace --disable-scamper-ping
    --disable-scamper-tracelb --disable-scamper-dealias
    --disable-scamper-tbit --disable-scamper-sting
    --disable-scamper-sniff --disable-scamper-host configure options

    (scamper -U /path/to/socket)
 - libscamperctrl:
  * fix handling of disconnected instances

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 05:58:57 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

    libraries and headers.
  * change --with-sc_uptime, --with-sc_hoiho, and --with-tests to be
    --enable-sc_uptime, --enable-sc_hoiho, and --enable-tests
  * disable maintainer mode, pass foreign to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

    symbols being exported from libscamperfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 06:20:24 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20230605:
 * HEADSUP: if you previously used -e pidfile to record the pid of a
   running scamper process, there is a good chance that the pidfile is
   owned by root.  scamper now attempts to write this file using the uid
   that started scamper, and will not be able to write it if scamper is
   not started by root (it should not be, rather the scamper binary
   should be setuid root).  Please delete the existing pidfile, or change
   its ownership, prior to restarting scamper, or scamper will not start.
 * scamper:
  * write a process ID that the user that started scamper can kill
    in the pidfile when using privsep.
  * when using privsep, exit the unprivileged process if the privileged
    process exits (is killed)
  * run as real uid from the start of scamper, for both privsep and
    not-privsep.
  * fix bug where attempting to open an unsupported datalink would
    leave a freed scamper_fd_t in the fd_tree and fd_list, leading to
    a crash.
  * fix double free triggered when a user provides an invalid dealias
    command.
  * fix memory leak if the payload was specified twice to ping or trace
  * rework pollfunc selection logic, use kqueue/epoll by default.
  * remove _malloc_options = "AJ" as this only works on unsupported
    versions of FreeBSD.
  * add additional paramaters to attach command to allow the user
    to override list and cycle parameters, documented in manual page.
  * catch EAGAIN/EINTR from select/kqueue/epoll to allow gdb to attach
    and detach without flagging errors.
  * for DNS replies for host command, record reply flags and rcode.
  * add support for SOA and NS queries in host.
  * add a JSON output for host measurements.
  * do not let scamper emit warts to a tty.  check for isatty in
    configure.
  * only allow -O and -z to be specified multiple times in a trace command
  * only allow -O to be specified multiple times in a ping command
  * split command parsing logic out from task probing logic.  add
    fuzzing cradle for parsing logic for all measurement types, and
    basic unit tests for dealias, ping, and trace parsing logic.
  * autodetect output type by file extension if output type is not
    explicitly specified on the command line.
 * libscamperfile:
  * remove all struct definitions from libscamperfile (e.g.
    scamper_trace, scamper_ping, scamper_addr, etc).  provide typedefs
    for each (scamper_trace_t) and _get() functions that return the
    field requested.  This change will allow hopefully allow
    libscamperfile's version to stabilize.  all scamper utilities now

Mon Apr 25 14:13:43 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop libscamperfile1 provides from the lib subpckage:
  libscamperfile.so.2 is not a drop-in replacement for anything
  that linked libscamperfile.so.1, and as such the provides is
  invalid. The obsoletes is technically wrong, but is there to fix
  the upgrade path of a wrongly-packaged libscamperfile.so.2 in a
  libscamperfile1 package.

  probes (or sequence number in SYN packets).  do not randomly
  generate sequence and ack values for each TCP ping.
  * rework options handling to allow for long long values.
  * set the window size in TCP probes to 65535, instead of advertising a
  zero receive window.
  * update configure scripts around the use of --with-privsep-dir-owner

  line
 * sc_erosprober:
  * new driver to periodically probe addresses and rotate output files.
 * sc_hoiho:
  * new utility for holistic orthography of Internet hostname
  observations.  this utility is only built if --with-sc_hoiho is

 * scamper:
  * json output format for tracelb (MDA traceroute)
  * print an error message if an output file cannot be opened
  * document (in warts.5) the offset variable in a warts traceroute record,
    and scamper_trace_dtree_t
  * use autoconf to check if X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host is available,
    rather than OpenSSL #defines that are not used consistently among
    OpenSSL-like libraries.
 * libscamperfile:
  * don't crash on a zero length file, or other conditions where sf->type
    is SCAMPER_FILE_NONE
  sc_ally:
  * fix example in manual page
  * dump 3: when merging routers in a transitive closure, remove the
    obsolete router from the dump list.
  * if an address is repeated in the input file then complain
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * document -C csum in sc_bdrmap.1
  * allow duplicate prefixes in the IXP file

    we want an address to be probed.  add logic to exit early if we are
    probing on with -I and there is a list of low-priority probing
    that is not empty, so that sc_uptime can meet the probe interval.
  * add the ability to expire addresses out of the database after they
    have not been seen in traceroute for a while, and they do not
    respond with an incrementing IPID value, with optional -E expiry
    parameter.
  * loading addresses into the state database is now a separate step (-a)
  * add a -c option to create and initialise a database file
  * add do-not-probe support
  * replace import code that used a row for each sample with a blob that
    stores multiple samples per blob.
  * report some measure of progress on import
  * build monotonic sequences which allow patterns in responses to be
    more easily identified, so that reboots are not falsely inferred
    in the cases of multiple counters, 16 bit counters, and routers
    that start each sequence after a PTB with a new IPID.
  * add an -O verbose to dump IPID sequences
  * document updates in sc_uptime.1

    rudimentary analysis of collected data.
 * sc_ttlexp:
  * new utility to dump source addresses from ICMP TTL expired
    messages in warts files.
 * sc_wartsfix:
  * add a manual page
 * sc_warts2csv:

     packets which could have come from an off-path attacker.
 - sc_radargun:
   * add -d 2 option, which dumps interface IP-ID behavior classifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 21:22:24 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to version 20170822
  scamper:
  * replace recursive versions of some functions with iterative versions.
  * add cycle-start and cycle-stop json record implementations.
  * fix traceroute json record: the hop transmit time value it reported
    was junk.
  * add support for sending json over the control socket.  use
    "attach format json" to get this mode; "attach" by itself still
    returns uuencoded warts.  Initial patch supplied by Young Hyun.
  * fix possible memory leaks detected with static analysis.
  * quality assurance on research paper cites in manual pages.
  * spelling errors noticed by Iain R. Learmonth.

  sc_ally:
  * add feature to dump inferred aliases from the collected data.

    alias sets, if pthreads are detected at compilation time and
    --disable-threads configure option is not supplied.

  sc_uptime:
  * new scamper driver to infer IPv6 device reboot windows if the device
    returns an incrementing identifier field in the IPv6 fragmentation
    header.  the driver is not built by default, as it expects sqlite3.
    use --with-sc_uptime configure option to build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 20:47:31 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to 20161204a
 * More fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn
 * if targets or commands are specified in a file, and that file
   ends after all probing of commands in that file has completed,
   finish the source, allowing scamper to exit.  this scenario is
   most likely when stdin is the input file.  Reported by Alex
   Colvin of Dyn
 * use select/poll/epoll/kqueue to look for read events on stdin files
 * malloc enough memory for a prefix6_t in the prefixtree code.  reported
   by Sebastian Wagner via gcc7.  only sc_bdrmap uses that code
 * increase size of string buffers for some ping and trace fields for text
   output to silence gcc7 warning.
 * allow source IP address to be null when outputting a trace with json
 * update sc_tbitblind.1 man page to show correct use of scamper's IPFW
   firewall support, which changed in the 20161204 release
 * fix unlikely unaligned access when computing checksums with IPv6
   addresses

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 20:20:18 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

 * add remote control socket support to scamper.  scamper can be
   configured to connect to a remote controller at run time to
   allow remote systems to control a scamper instance.  the
   remote controller is handled by the sc_remoted utility, and
   is documented in the sc_remoted manual page (see below).
 * fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts data files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn.
 * add a PATRICIA trie implementation based off Sedgewick's
   Algorithms in C++ book.  this improves the performance
   of scamper compared to holding addresses in splaytrees.
 * improve speed of warts(5) code.
 * improve speed of scamper_writebuf by allocating pagesize blocks
   at a time.
 * begin to document ping warts records in warts(5).
 * fix debug printf implementation so that all features will
   be built in as long as --without-debugfile is not used.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * silence compiler warnings from Microsoft Visual Studio.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * sc_prefixscan:
  * add a utility, sc_prefixscan, that provides a convenient
    interface to scamper's prefixscan alias resolution method.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_prefixscan.1.pdf
 * sc_radargun:
  * add a utility, sc_radargun, that provides a convenient

    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_radargun.1.pdf
 * sc_remoted:
  * add a utility, sc_remoted, that provides an interface to a
    collection of remote scamper instances.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_remoted.1.pdf
 * sc_ally:
  * use writebufs so sc_ally is event driven and will not block.
  * add code to probe candidate sets in pairs, with transitive
    closure to save probes.
  * allow inter-probe gaps of less than 1 second.
 * sc_attach:
  * add support for remote control sockets.
  * add an option to randomise the order tasks are run.
 * sc_speedtrap:
  * stricter default test for inferring if two IP addresses may
    share a single shared counter.
    backported to 20141211g.
  * code cleanup.
 * sc_warts2json
  * add support for printing ICMP extensions included in traceroute
