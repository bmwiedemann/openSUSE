Mon Oct 20 11:15:58 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20251020:
  * rework most internal use of printerror/scamper_debug, tagging
    measurement results with errmsg strings if an error occurs affecting
    a measurement.
  * emit errmsg strings in json and warts output.  errmsg strings will
    also be emitted to debugfile / stderr as before.  these strings
    are not emitted in text output of measurements.
  * add error result code (stop reason) to dealias measurements.
  * silently ignore unlikely PTR lookup error conditions for trace and
    tracelb -- PTR lookups are not essential components of these
  - measurements.
  * fix memory leaks when encountering unlikely error conditions in
    sting, tbit, tracelb, udpprobe.
  - libscamperfile:
  * add scamper_*_errmsg_get functions.
  * let neighbourdisc src_mac and dst_ip be null when reading warts
    files, rather than reject the object.
  * bump version.
  - Python library:
  * release GIL when waiting for measurement results so that module is
    asyncio friendly.
  * add errmsg attribute to measurement objects, interface file, and
    document.
  - sc_wartsdump:
  * use scamper_*_[stop|result]_tostr functions rather than duplicate code.
  * emit errmsg.
  - tests:
  * check that errmsg is read-from and written-to warts files correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  6 11:11:39 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Update to version 20251002:
 * scamper:
  * add tls_errstr, use it in printerror_ssl.
  * minify ping and trace json output by removing spaces in output.
  * host: if qname contains a trailing dot, remove the trailing dot, so that
    example.com. and example.com are equivalent.
  * host: if do-not-probe file contains a prefix covering a nameserver
    in /etc/resolv.conf, still allow the host command to use it.
 * libscamperfile:
  * provide API access to udpprobe stop_reason and its string rendering.
  * add scamper_dealias_reply_is_icmp_echo_reply().
  * silence spurious uninitialized use warning in scamper_http_lib.c.
  * add scamper_tbit_totext().
  * fix regression from 20241112 when reading tbit warts, which rejected
    valid tbit measurements.
 * libscamperctrl:
  * add iata attribute to scamper_vp_t.
 * Python module:
  * use #defines from scamper C header files in more places.
  * support pickling of ScamperAddr.
  * add .iata attribute to ScamperVP, ScamperInst.
  * add .stop_reason and .stop_reason_str attributes to ScamperHost,
    ScamperHttp, ScamperPing and ScamperUdpprobe.
  * add ScamperDealias.is_icmp_echo_reply().
  * add to_text() method to ScamperDealias, ScamperPing, ScamperTbit,
    ScamperTrace, ScamperTracelb.
  * update pyi to match API changes, fix enums with latest mypy.
 * sc_remoted:
  * add iata to list of supported metadata items per VP, document in
    man page.
 * sc_minrtt:
  * add -a anycast-file option, to specify a file containing apparent
    anycast prefixes.  sc_minrtt will not consider samples for a covered
    IP address if any of the samples collected by sc_pinger for the
    address imply the address could not be in a single location.
    document in man page.
 * sc_wartsdump:
  * print error code for udpprobe.
 * tests:
  * add more qname tests in unit_cmd_host.c.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 26 07:34:15 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Update to 20250804:
 * scamper:
  * fix regression from 20250106 where scamper might not write the final
    measurement result and hang indefinitely, if you are unlucky.
  * add do-not-probe file support, with -O dnp=file option, documented
    in man page.  do-not-probe file support can be disabled with
    --disable-scamper-dnp configure option.
  * let traceroute with PMTUD use ICMP-echo probes, document in man page.
  * document existence of ping -O mss=val option in man page.
 * throughout:
  * remove string_concaf from more places.
 * Python module:
  * no change to the module.
  * in python interface file (scamper.pyi), fix types of
    ScamperDealiasMidardiscRound.start and ScamperCtrl.do_midarest(addrs),
    and make ScamperCtrl generic in parameter type to help with static
    type checking.
 * sc_remoted:
  * catch TERM signal (in addition to INT and HUP)
  * write pidfile after becoming daemon, when -D is used

    rename time-based variables in event loop after their use to
    make it more obvious what is going on
    fix json rendering of pmtud traceroutes with a host-connected MTU
    mismatch

    splaytree_to_dlist to reduce repeated code
    silence warnings and errors when compiling with gcc 2.95          
  * tests:

    expand scamper_addr tests to include cmp, human_cmp,        
    prefix, first-bit-diff, and prefixhosts
    expand trace tests to include a pmtud traceroute with a
    host-connected MTU mismatch
  * Python module:
    make ScamperIcmpExts.ext_count be an attribute, consistent with

  * hopefully fix build on solaris
 * libscamperfile:
  * chase separation of traceroute probes from replies, add scamper_trace_hopiter_* to simplify required user code modifications.
  * fix 20250227 regression that did not read ipid32 in ping replies correctly, which lead to speedtrap not working.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  5 11:22:07 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20250401:
 - scamper:
  * move items that require privilege (opening files, unlinking files,
    opening raw sockets, datalink interfaces) into scamper_priv.c and
    have each follow a consistent pattern.  previously these were
    distributed throughout many source code files.
  * add build option that allows scamper to decide if it will do
    privilege separation at run time.
    the --enable-scamper-privsep=rootonly configure option enables this
    behavior.  if run with root privileges, scamper will do privilege
    separation.  if not run with root privileges, scamper will not.
    --enable-scamper-privsep=yes (the default) does privilege separation
    regardless of root privilege status.
    note: the previous --disable-privsep configure option has become
    --disable-scamper-privsep
  * restructure the way that blocked tasks (tasks that share a probe
    signature) are handled
  * add -O mss=foo option to ping, which will include mss option to
    TCP syn probe methods.
  * ignore packets on the datalink interface associated with a probe
    that has a timestamp after the datalink packet's timestamp.
  * increase scamper -H holdtime limit from 10s to 60s.
  - python module:
  * add ScamperCtrl.outfile setter
  * fix ScamperFile filter_types
 - libscamperfile:
  * handle termination HTTP chunk correctly (noticed running unit tests
    on MacOS, which has a stricter strtol)
  * be more accepting when processing HTTP headers
 - libscamperctrl:
  * fix bug when reading partial control messages from mux
 - tests:
  * add unit test for prefixtree implementation
  * add tests for parsing HTTP headers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  1 11:50:34 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

    update trace and tracelb to use new storage form.
 - sc_remoted:
  * add mux support, enabling drivers to work with multiple remote
    scamper instances over a single unix domain socket

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 12 13:46:25 UTC 2025 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to scamper 20250106:
 * scamper:
  * handle many ports in BPF compiler better.
  * remove cycles, autoreload features from file input sources.
  * do not compile in support for select(2) by default (saving CPU and
    memory in the default use).
  * normalize kqueue(2) / epoll(2) code paths.
  * use IP_RECVIF on platforms (FreeBSD) that don't have IP_PKTINFO.
  * remove sig_tx_ip_src from task signature structure, nothing used it.
  * add holdtime (-H) parameter back to scamper, will controls the
    length of time that scamper will hold task signatures before
    allowing a follow up measurement to use the same signature.  5
    seconds by default, disable with zero (to save memory and CPU).
  * fix compilation when platform has IPV6_PKTINFO but not
    IPV6_RECVPKTINFO setsockopt (old platforms).
  * replace calls to getaddrinfo AI_NUMERICHOST with calls to inet_pton
    (fixes complilation on old MacOS, and is probably the faster
    solution generally).
  * increase pps-max (scamper -p) to 50,000.
  * adjust timestamps using datalink timestamps when using
    trace -N <squeries>.
  * reduce memory use in storing traceroute state.
  * remove per-measurement pktbufs, to save a tiny amount of memory.
  * refactor BPF compiler to make it more obvious what is going on.
  * refactor ping task signatures to make it more obvious what is going
    on.
  * refactor scamper's timeout calculation to make it more obvious what
    is going on.
  * move output of done tasks into its own function to make it more
    obvious what is going on.
 * throughout:
  * reduce memory use in dlist_t, splaytree_t, heap_t.
  * rearrange header include order in mjl_heap.c, mjl_list.c,
    mjl_patricia.c, mjl_prefixtree.c, mjl_splaytree.c so that asserts
    are not compiled in by default (saving CPU).
  * update string_concat code reduce use of vsnprintf, which will
    reduce CPU use in things like rendering json.
  * remove hardly-used onremove callback support from [cds]list_t,
    splaytree_t, heap_t, saving memory / CPU.
 * libscamperfile, libscamperctrl:
  * bump library version because underlying code changed (API did not)
 * tests:
  * add string_concat test to unit_string.
  * add unit_splaytree, unit_heap, unit_http_warts, unit_ping_warts,
    unit_trace_warts, unit_udpprobe_warts tests.  http, trace, and
    udpprobe warts unit tests were contributed by Marcus Luckie.
  * add fuzz_warts for fuzzing libscamperfile, contributed by Marcus
    Luckie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 16 17:58:30 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20241112:
 * scamper:
  * check bound source address when attempting to reuse open sockets.
  * bind to the specified source address with for all udp6 sockets used
    with udp-sport ping method.
  * finalize task signatures for ping, trace, udpprobe, and dealias
    immediately before tasks begin probing to provide more ability for
    parallel measurements to the same destinations.

  * correct bugs in documentation
  * add to_json() to all measurement types where there's a scamper json
    rendering
 * libscamperfile:
  * fix memory leaks on malformed warts input
  * add scamper_*_tojson functions for dealias, host, ping, tbit, trace,
    tracelb, and udpprobe
  * move Makefile rules for libscamperfile from scamper/Makefile.am into
    lib/libscamperfile/Makefile.am

  * add -R /path/to/socket to enable speedtrap to use a remote scamper
    instance
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
  * update man page with documentation
 * configure:
  * add --disable-utils and --disable-libs options to configure, to control
    how much of the scamper package is actually built.
  * update to serial 37 of ax_python_devel.m4 and serial 8 of
    ax_gcc_builtin.m4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 23 07:17:26 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

* update to version 20240920:
 * scamper:
  * add -O noring to disable use of ring buffer on Linux when
    scamper is configured with --enable-scamper-ring
  * udpprobe: add -S src parameter, update manual page with
    previously supported but undocumented options
 * sc_prefixprober:
  * allow do-not-probe list to be embedded in the input set of
    prefixes to probe, update manual page.
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the sc_prefixprober
    utility came from
 * Python module:
  * add src parameter to ScamperCtrl.do_udpprobe
* update to version 20240916:
 * scamper:
  * with ping -F 0 and trace -s 0, choose a different TCP or UDP source
    port if an otherwise available source port has been used in the past
    5 seconds to the same destination IP and port.
  * ping: add udp-sport probe method
  * ping: refactor udp packet matching on datalink sockets
  * allow -D when outputting to a file.
  * use SO_TIMESTAMP on linux packet sockets, rather than call an ioctl,
    to fix buggy linux timestamps when not using ring
  * rework privsep code to be signal aware, and forward signals from
    scamper's privileged process to scamper's unprivileged process via
    the socketpair between the processes.  i.e.,
    scamper -D -U /path/to/scamper-unix-socket -e /path/to/scamper.pid
    kill -HUP `cat /path/to/scamper.pid`
    now works.  TERM and INT also propagate from privileged to
    unprivileged process.  this allows the user that started scamper to
    send signals to the privileged process, which it then forwards to
    unprivileged process.  the user who started scamper is otherwise not
    able to send the unprivileged process signals, as that process
    typically runs as user nobody.
  * host: add -O nsid to signal queried server to include nsid OPT
    record in response.  parse any server-provided OPT records.
  * udpprobe: record ifname replies were received on
  * udpprobe: increase supported probe size from 1000 to 1400 bytes.
  * factor out most repeated tls code patterns into utils_tls.c
  * add functions to utils_tls.c to load key material from opened
    file descriptors, to allow key material to be reloaded in
    unprivileged process
  * reload TLS key material on HUP signal
  * do not negotiate use of TLS v1.1
  * refactor privsep code to make it obvious which functions belong to
    which process, and develop an obvious pattern in the code.
  * make route socket interface work on NetBSD again
  * tracelb: fix sport validation
  * other minor code cleanups
 * sc_minrtt:
  * thread input stage, add batch import.  by default, sc_minrtt
    will import N files per batch, where N is the number of processors
    online.
  * add -b batchc parameter that allows for batch size to be adjusted
    according to what is appropriate for the system
  * set exit status to zero when import is successful
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
  * refactor code in places
 * libscamperfile:
  * bump version to account for added interfaces for udpprobe, host
    objects.
 * Python module:
  * add nsid option to ScamperCtrl.do_dns method

    (udpsize, edns_version, edns_do attributes)
  * add context manager support to ScamperFile and ScamperCtrl, allowing
    for Python with / as syntax
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * change -v vp-ases option to -V vp-ases
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from
 * sc_attach, sc_hoiho, sc_remoted:
  * add -v to emit version of scamper release the utility came from

Mon Aug 19 07:05:31 UTC 2024 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Remove upper bound on Cython, Cython 3 appears to be supported. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 17 08:16:38 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20240716:
 * scamper
  * add -O dl-any option to scamper, which causes scamper to open a
    cooked datalink interface bound to "any" on Linux.  Note that
    scamper's implementation of -O dl-any currently prevents
    transmission of packets on the datalink socket, but this will
    change in the future.
  * add -O dyn-filter option to scamper, which causes scamper to
    dynamically adjust the BPF filter that it configures on a datalink
    socket according to TCP/UDP ports that scamper is using.  this
    option is only available on Linux, and BSD systems with BIOCSETFNR
    (FreeBSD and MacOS).  note that both -O dyn-filter and -O dl-any
    cannot currently be used at the same time, but this will change in
    the future.
  * only raise SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF; some systems (e.g. Linux)
    already have larger socket buffers than scamper's defaults.
  * add -O sockrx to ping, to force ping to receive ICMP responses over
    a regular socket, even when using -O dl (which still records datalink
    transmit timestamps).
  * speed up receiving on datalink sockets by avoiding unnecessary
    memsets and removing unused fields, and adjust BSD, Linux, DLPI code
    to follow similar code patterns.
  * consider both directions for TCP packets on datalink sockets,
    allowing datalink transmit timestamps to be recorded for non TCP-syn
    packets.
  * avoid processing duplicate copies of the same packet on Linux
    loopback interface with datalink sockets.
  * remove "observe" functionality from scamper control socket, as
    signalled over a year ago.  "outfile" and "source" will be removed
    from the control socket in the future.
  * cleanup scamper_dlhdr.[ch], use scamper_dlhdr_t to scamper_probe_t
    instead of its constituent parts.
  * update tbit usage statement in scamper, and manual page, with
    currently supported options
 * python module:
  * use join to assemble command strings for all ScamperCtrl.do_*()
    for orders of magnitude faster command generation
  * implement __richcmp__ for all classes where __eq__, __lt__, etc,
    were previously defined individually
  * if string passed to ScamperAddr is invalid, raise an exception
  * implement ScamperCtrl.do_tbit method, ScamperTbit classes
 * sc_minrtt:
  * add sc_minrtt utility, which takes the output of sc_pinger to
    produce a minimized RTT input file for sc_hoiho.  to build, pass
    --enable-sc_minrtt as well as --with-pcre or --with-pcre2 to
    configure, and have sqlite3 development headers and libraries in
    build environment.
 * tests:
  * more ping and tbit command unit tests
  * split out ARP reply parsing code into dl_parse_arp, add fuzzing cradle.
- update to version 20240725:
 * scamper:
  * add dynamic BPF filters for linux "any" packet interface, allowing
    both -O dyn-filter and -O dl-any.
  * avoid generating debugging statements that won't be emitted, saving
    CPU in the usual scamper operating mode.
  * process dltx timestamps when -N > 1 and tx timestamp is available
    after the response has already arrived
  * don't allow TCP traceroute and -N > 1 because packet matching
    responses from the destination is challenging.
  * use scamper_seteuid_[raise|lower] in scamper when built without
    privsep, rather than use a repeated code pattern.
 * configure:
  * add --enable-scamper-ring to configure to make -O ring the default
 * python module:
  * take account of stop_hop when iterating through traceroute hops,
    add ScamperTrace.stop_hop attribute.
  * add ScamperTrace.addrs() convenience method, which returns unique
    addresses observed in the path
  * add ScamperHost.ans_ptrs() convenience method, which returns the
    text from PTR records in a response
  * update documentation:
    https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/python/
 * sc_analysis_dump:
  * drop geolocation code from utility, which was not plumbed into
    configure.
 * tests:
  * add check-ifdef.pl to check for obvious #ifdef bugs
- update to version 20240813:
 * scamper:
  * properly set icmp_id on ICMP probe signature in ping when -F 0.
  * reduce code duplication in scamper_fd.c by replacing fd_udp() and
    fd_tcp() with fd_tcpudp().
  * process IPv6 TCP replies in dealias.
  * simplify BPF logic, support unit testing of dl_filter_compile.
  * fix 20240725 regression to actually call scamper_debug logic for
    datalink packets.
 * python module:
  * raise exception if ScamperCtrl.do_*() is called on a ScamperInst
    that has signalled EOF.
  * add ScamperInst.is_eof() method.
 * configure:
  * check for tcp_timer.h in configure, use if found, to fix check
    for tcp_var.h.
 * sc_pinger, sc_minrtt:
  * support batch probing with radargun primitive.
  * update sc_pinger manual page with batch probing details.
 * tests:
  * silence benign clang static analysis warnings.
  * add more ping command unit tests.
  * add unit_dl_filter_compile to test bpf compiler.
  * enhance check-ifdef.pl to find #define / #ifdef ordering issues,
    make pass through code to adjust header ordering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 06:41:00 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix dependency of libscamperfile-devel: require the new
  libscamperfile9. The last updated bumped the so-version, which
  results in a different package name.
- Drop all obsoletes of libscamperfile9: obsoleting old library
  packages is explicitly not to be done according to the packaging
  guidelines around shared libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  5 14:11:00 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

* update to version 20240503:
 * scamper:
   * improvements with -N squeries; let -Q send all probes when using -N.
     add -H wait-probe-hop, which specifies the minimum delay between
     probes with the same TTL.  identify the hop that would have caused
     traceroute to stop when not using -N so that a normal traceroute
     path with one hop representing the destination or stopping hop in
     the path is rendered.  in the json output, put extra hops beyond
     the stopping hop into a extra_hops array.
   * make ring-nolocked the default when using -O ring.
   * improvements with udpprobe: provide ability to send multiple copies
     of the same payload, add json output, reuse available UDP sockets
     where possible.
   * consistently set and record the IPv4 tos and IPv6 tclass fields for
     both ping and trace.
   * fix warts.bz2 and warts.xz output, which could previously use all
     available space on the file system.
   * speed up rendering of byte arrays as hex in json output.
   * fix obtaining IPv6 hoplimit on received packets on MacOS.
   * record the name of the interface that received IPv4 and IPv6 ICMP
     responses in ping.
   * add TXT queries to host command; add chaos query class; add
     DNS-over-TCP.
   * fix use of ctype functions according to netbsd (cast all parameters
     to unsigned char).  make pass through use of ctype functions to do
     ctype function calls last in most logical statements.
   * cleanup scamper_file_warts.h so that only necessary struct
     definitions are in that header.
 * libscamperfile:
   * add new functions, bump library version due to udpprobe changes.
 * python library
   * improve the usefulness of the ScamperInstError exceptions
   * let all address parameters to do_() methods also be ScamperAddr
   * support creation of ScamperAddr from bytes objects
   * updates to support new functionality in udpprobe primitive
   * support RR filters on all sections of a DNS response
   * add tx, rx, and rtt attributes to DNS responses
   * add qtype=txt, qclass=chaos, tcp DNS queries, and ScamperHostTxt
     class.
   * add helper method to get ns and txt records out of ans section
     -- ans_nses() and ans_txts()
   * add rx and ifname attributes to ScamperPingReply
   * add ScamperDealiasProbe.is_from_target() method
 * configure:
   * remove obsolete AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL
   * fix net/pfvar.h conditional
 * sc_hoiho:
   * fix crashes in IP and FNU stages so that router name regular
     expression inferences work again.
 * sc_wartscat:
   * fix index into infiles array
 * tests:
   * add tests for string_byte2hex, and json escaping
   * add unit tests for TXT records
   * add fuzzing cradle for host_rr_list
   * in fuzz_cmd cradle, ensure any error strings only contain printable
     characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 19:34:46 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 20240229:
  * bugfix: correct SCAMPER_DL_IS_ICMP_TIME_REPLY macro so that scamper
    does not ignore ICMP replies quoting TCP/UDP packets for 1/256
    source port values.
  * bugfixes for -O icmp-rxerr: handle EPOLLERR on linux, try using
    IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT before IPV6_HOPLIMIT for IPv6 udp probing.
  * bugfix: fix possible assertions in dealias, trace, and tracelb code.
  * ping: count UDP replies as from the target
  * trace: correct datalink timestamp adjustments
  * add more specific error messages when a scamper command is not
    accepted, return them over control socket or terminal, as appropriate.
  * scamper_fd_t: refactor fd_addr, fd_sport, fd_dl, fd_ifindex
  * scamper_fd_t: decouple udp4raw/udp4dg from each other.  use udp4dg
    and udp6 sockets in udpprobe primitive, rather than have each
    udpprobe task create its own socket.
  * scamper_fd_t: add methods that return an available open socket for
    probing a given destination without blocking if another task is
    probing the same destination.  use this with ping -F 0 and trace -s 0,
    instead of generating random port values, so that scamper opens
    the minimum number of file descriptors.
  * ping and trace: have -O dl mean to capture transmit and receive
    timestamps from a datalink interface.  add -O raw option so that
    IPv4 TCP probes can be transmitted over a raw socket, to allow transmitted
    TCP packets to be observed on the datalink interface.
  * add memory-mapped ring buffer support (PACKET_RX_RING) for receiving
    packets on datalink sockets on Linux.  enable at scamper runtime
    with -O ring.  contributed by Alistair King.
  ## python module:
  * generate module .c with Cython 0.29.37, to enable module to compile
    with Python 3.11.
  * link against libpython
  * have all time parameters take either a timedelta or float/int.  float/int
    parameters are all seconds.
  * add ScamperInstError exception which identifies the scamper instance
    and includes the error string returned by the instance.
  * reduce copying in methods that return bytes objects
  * add str method for ScamperInst
- reenable python build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  6 09:07:29 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Temporarily disable Python build because of incompatibility with Python 3.11
  Reported upstream, will be fixed in next version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 12:59:00 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Update to version 20240122:
 * scamper
  * fix regression in 20240117 where trace -W 0 (probe as soon as
    there's a response) was not accepted, despite being the default.
    add unit test for this.
  * for trace, improve probe and reply matching of UDP packets
  * fix printing UDP responses to traceroute probes in scamper -O text output
  * for trace section of scamper.1 man page, document -O const-payload,
    and expand documentation for -O dl.
 * python module:
  * ship scamper release with a the C source code pre-generated for the
    python module, so that the build process does not require a cython
    installation.  bootstrap.pl will build the C source code unless told
    not to via --without-cython
  * rename ScamperPing.reply_count to ScamperPing.stop_count, as the
    reply_count attribute meant something different on a ScamperPing
    object than what it means with ScamperDealiasProbe, etc
 * sc_remoted:
  * expand sc_remoted.1 manual page with information about validating
    scamper client TLS certificates, and how to use -M monitor-name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 07:35:36 UTC 2024 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20240117:
 - scamper:
  - fix crashes if a task is provided an apparent response, but the task
 -   has not yet sent a packet in ping, sting, tbit, trace, tracelb.
  - find and fix memory leaks in measurement command parsing code via
 -   fuzzing.
  - add udpprobe, http, dealias -m midarest, and dealias -m midardisc methods.
 -   udpprobe and http do not currently have json output methods.
  - remove -d dport, -s sport, and -t ttl dealias parameters.  these
 -   were only valid for mercator, and can be specified in a probedef instead.
  - record size of responses for dealias probes.
  - modify all commands to be able to take human-friendly wait parameters --
 -   e.g. trace -W 0.5s or trace -W 500ms instead of trace -W 50000.
  - support transmitting raw packets on linux ppp interfaces
  - add -b payload-size parameter to ping
 - python interface:
  - add python interface to most of scamper.  building this module requires
 -   cython < 3.0.  to build, use something like:
 -   PYTHON=/path/to/python CYTHON=/path/to/cython ./configure --with-python
  - the documentation for this interface is available at
 -   https://www.caida.org/catalog/software/scamper/python/
  - the ubuntu PPA provides python3-scamper, and the FreeBSD port should
 -   hopefully provide py-scamper shortly.  these sources may be useful
 -   for getting the module packaged for other operating systems.
 -   https://launchpad.net/~matthewluckie/+archive/ubuntu/scamper
 - libscamperfile and libscamperctrl:
  - improvements, bump versions
 - tests:
  - many new unit tests and fuzzing cradles for scamper components
 - sc_pinger:
  - add -l limit and -M move-dir options
 - sc_remoted:
  - no need to link against libscamperfile, remove dependency
 - sc_attach, sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_wartsfix:
  - compile / link on windows.

    windows.
  * fix compile-on-FreeBSD-15+ where pf firewall does not have
    DIOCGETSTATUS ioctl
  * in scamper's remote control (-R option), fix file descriptor leak
    when unable to reconnect to the remote controller.
  * add --disable-scamper-trace --disable-scamper-ping
    --disable-scamper-tracelb --disable-scamper-dealias
    --disable-scamper-tbit --disable-scamper-sting
    --disable-scamper-sniff --disable-scamper-host configure options
    to build scamper without specific measurement capabilities.

    (scamper -U /path/to/socket)
 - libscamperctrl:
  * fix handling of disconnected instances

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  9 05:58:57 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

 * configure:
  * better tests for zlib, libbz2, and liblzma that check for both
    libraries and headers.
  * change --with-sc_uptime, --with-sc_hoiho, and --with-tests to be
    --enable-sc_uptime, --enable-sc_hoiho, and --enable-tests
  * disable maintainer mode, pass foreign to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

    those symbols being exported from libscamperfile
 * sc_prefixprober:
  * allow compression type to be specified using -O
  * free scamper_addr_t as each are removed from the list to probe
 * sc_remoted:
  * catch EPOLLHUP with epoll
 * sc_warts2text:
  * fix memory leaks
 * sc_wartsdump:
  * fix memory leaks
  * link against utils.o so that sc_wartsdump is not reliant on those
    symbols being exported from libscamperfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 06:20:24 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20230605:
 * HEADSUP: if you previously used -e pidfile to record the pid of a
   running scamper process, there is a good chance that the pidfile is
   owned by root.  scamper now attempts to write this file using the uid
   that started scamper, and will not be able to write it if scamper is
   not started by root (it should not be, rather the scamper binary
   should be setuid root).  Please delete the existing pidfile, or change
   its ownership, prior to restarting scamper, or scamper will not start.
 * scamper:
  * write a process ID that the user that started scamper can kill
    in the pidfile when using privsep.
  * when using privsep, exit the unprivileged process if the privileged
    process exits (is killed)
  * run as real uid from the start of scamper, for both privsep and
    not-privsep.
  * fix bug where attempting to open an unsupported datalink would
    leave a freed scamper_fd_t in the fd_tree and fd_list, leading to
    a crash.
  * fix double free triggered when a user provides an invalid dealias
    command.
  * fix memory leak if the payload was specified twice to ping or trace
  * rework pollfunc selection logic, use kqueue/epoll by default.
  * remove _malloc_options = "AJ" as this only works on unsupported
    versions of FreeBSD.
  * add additional paramaters to attach command to allow the user
    to override list and cycle parameters, documented in manual page.
  * catch EAGAIN/EINTR from select/kqueue/epoll to allow gdb to attach
    and detach without flagging errors.
  * for DNS replies for host command, record reply flags and rcode.
  * add support for SOA and NS queries in host.
  * add a JSON output for host measurements.
  * do not let scamper emit warts to a tty.  check for isatty in
    configure.
  * only allow -O and -z to be specified multiple times in a trace command
  * only allow -O to be specified multiple times in a ping command
  * split command parsing logic out from task probing logic.  add
    fuzzing cradle for parsing logic for all measurement types, and
    basic unit tests for dealias, ping, and trace parsing logic.
  * autodetect output type by file extension if output type is not
    explicitly specified on the command line.
 * libscamperfile:
  * remove all struct definitions from libscamperfile (e.g.
    scamper_trace, scamper_ping, scamper_addr, etc).  provide typedefs
    for each (scamper_trace_t) and _get() functions that return the
    field requested.  This change will allow hopefully allow
    libscamperfile's version to stabilize.  all scamper utilities now
    use these get functions.
  * shift some functions that were previously implemented in
    libscamperfile into the one place they were used, if they were only
    used in (for example scamper / sc_analysis_dump / other scamper
    utility).  delete other functions that were not used anywhere in
    the public scamper release.
 * libscamperctrl:
  * fix bug by ensuring line_off is always valid after the read.
  * catch EAGAIN from select.
  * add kqueue support.
  * add scamper_attp_* routines to allow applications to specify
    list and cycle parameters.
  * for scamper_inst_do, take a parameter to keep with each task.
  * add scamper_task_getparam function to get the parameter.
  * add scamper_task_getcmd function to get the command associated with a task.
  * use TYPE_FATAL instead of TYPE_ERR in application callback when
    scamper_inst_read encounters a fatal error, only use TYPE_ERR when
    scamper does not accept a command.
 * sc_prefixprober:
  * new driver to conduct measurements (ping, trace, tracelb) to an
    address in each prefix.
 * sc_ally:
  * use scamper_file_t outfiles, add ability to write gz/bz2/xz files.
  * ask for cycle-start and cycle-stop records, write them out.
  * improve use of libscamperctrl.
 * sc_hoiho:
  * add support for VP geohints, document.
  * silence -Wshadow.
  * silence warnings related to assignments that are not used.

  * silence warnings related to assignments that are not used.
  * fix memory leak in up_reboots_doone.
 * sc_warts2json:
  * fix memory leak with cycle start/stop records.
  * emit json for host records.
 * sc_wartscat:
  * fix ability to write compressed warts files.
- update to version 20230323:
 * libscamperfile:
  * add ability for scamper and all utilities to read warts and arts
    files compressed with bzip2 and xz, if libbz2 and liblzma are found
    by configure.
  * add ability for scamper and all utilities to write warts files
    compressed with gzip, bzip2, and xz, if zlib, libbz2, and liblzma
    are found by configure.
  * tidy up libscamperfile code.
 * misc:
  * silence -Wsign-compare and -Wtype-limits
  * tidy usage statements for sc_uptime and sc_tbitpmtud
  * document use of '-' to read from stdin and write to stdout
    in sc_wartsfilter.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  7 09:28:35 UTC 2023 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- Update to version 20230302:
 - scamper:
  * use a random source port / ICMP ID in trace if -s 0.
  * better parallelize pings to a single destination that use
    udp-dport, tcp-ack-sport, or tcp-syn-sport probe methods.
  * document default value of source port consistently for all
    measurements that take a source port parameter in the man page.

- Update to version 20230224:
 - scamper:
  - allow multiple parallel measurements to the same destination,
 -   provided the measurements have probe signatures that scamper can
 -   distinguish.
  - return the associated task ID with each DATA blob in control socket.
 -   this task ID matches the ID returned in an OK when scamper accepted
 -   the task.
  - in ping, only compute delay statistics on responses from destination.
  - in ping, allow timeout to be expressed in fractions of a second.
 - libscamperfile:
  - support reading gz-compressed warts files.
 - libscamperctrl:
  - add libscamperctrl, a library to interact with a collection of
 -   scamper instances.
  - modify sc_ally, sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_speedtrap, and
 -   sc_pinger to use this library.
  - this library is likely to evolve.  current behaviour is documented
 -   in libscamperctrl manual page.
 - misc:
  - improve sc_wartsfilter manual page with examples.
  - add remote control socket support to sc_pinger.
  - fix kqueue/epoll loop in sc_remoted.
  - consistently use size_t throughout when counting number of items.
  - build without warnings using -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter.
  - improvements through adding function attributes to printf-like
 -   functions.

 - scamper:
  * add an option (-O cafile=/path/to/file) to load CA certificates
    from a specific file when starting scamper for validating a
    remote controller's certificate (this was released in 20211212a)
  * add options

Mon Apr 25 14:13:43 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop libscamperfile1 provides from the lib subpckage:
  libscamperfile.so.2 is not a drop-in replacement for anything
  that linked libscamperfile.so.1, and as such the provides is
  invalid. The obsoletes is technically wrong, but is there to fix
  the upgrade path of a wrongly-packaged libscamperfile.so.2 in a
  libscamperfile1 package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 25 20:29:54 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- remove SIOCGSTAMP.patch
- update to version 20190916:
 * scamper
  * add a host implementation for looking up DNS records.  it uses
  the first nameserver it finds in /etc/resolv.conf by default.
  * add an -O ptr option to tracelb.
  * bugfix json output for tracelb.
  * integrate patricia trie implementation into scamper hotspot
  * use HAVE_SYSCTL macro to solve a compile issue on android
  * include <linux/sockios.h> to get SIOCGSTAMP in Linux kernel > 5.2
  * add -A option to ping code to set the ack number to use in tcp
  probes (or sequence number in SYN packets).  do not randomly
  generate sequence and ack values for each TCP ping.
  * rework options handling to allow for long long values.
  * set the window size in TCP probes to 65535, instead of advertising a
  zero receive window.
  * update configure scripts around the use of --with-privsep-dir-owner
 * sc_ally:
  * when outputting alias sets, conduct a canonical sort to allow for
  easy diffs
  * update man page because sc_ally can take more than two addresses per
  line
 * sc_erosprober:
  * new driver to periodically probe addresses and rotate output files.
 * sc_hoiho:
  * new utility for holistic orthography of Internet hostname
  observations.  this utility is only built if --with-sc_hoiho is
  passed to configure.  sc_hoiho requires pcre or pcre2, which can be
  controlled by passing --with-pcre or --with-pcre2 to configure.
 * sc_uptime:
  * add a last_tx column to state_dsts to allow for simple monitoring of
  when each destination address was last probed.
 * various drivers:
  * handle scamper disconnections gracefully in sc_ally,
  sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_radargun, sc_speedtrap,
  sc_tbitblind, sc_tbitpmtud, and sc_uptime

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 22 22:04:19 UTC 2018 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix@sebix.at>

- update to version 20181219:
 * scamper:
  * json output format for tracelb (MDA traceroute)
  * print an error message if an output file cannot be opened
  * document (in warts.5) the offset variable in a warts traceroute record,
    and scamper_trace_dtree_t
  * use autoconf to check if X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host is available,
    rather than OpenSSL #defines that are not used consistently among
    OpenSSL-like libraries.
 * libscamperfile:
  * don't crash on a zero length file, or other conditions where sf->type
    is SCAMPER_FILE_NONE
  sc_ally:
  * fix example in manual page
  * dump 3: when merging routers in a transitive closure, remove the
    obsolete router from the dump list.
  * if an address is repeated in the input file then complain
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * document -C csum in sc_bdrmap.1
  * allow duplicate prefixes in the IXP file
  * add initial support for UDP paris traceroute, as an alternative
    to the ICMP paris traceroute bdrmap uses by default.
  * document updates in sc_bdrmap.1
 * sc_ttlexp:
  * add -O noreserved
  * bugfix reading from stdin, file handling
  * document updates in sc_ttlexp.1
 * sc_uptime:
  * add an optional -I interval parameter which controls how frequently
    we want an address to be probed.  add logic to exit early if we are
    probing on with -I and there is a list of low-priority probing
    that is not empty, so that sc_uptime can meet the probe interval.
  * add the ability to expire addresses out of the database after they
    have not been seen in traceroute for a while, and they do not
    respond with an incrementing IPID value, with optional -E expiry
    parameter.
  * loading addresses into the state database is now a separate step (-a)
  * add a -c option to create and initialise a database file
  * add do-not-probe support
  * replace import code that used a row for each sample with a blob that
    stores multiple samples per blob.
  * report some measure of progress on import
  * build monotonic sequences which allow patterns in responses to be
    more easily identified, so that reboots are not falsely inferred
    in the cases of multiple counters, 16 bit counters, and routers
    that start each sequence after a PTB with a new IPID.
  * add an -O verbose to dump IPID sequences
  * document updates in sc_uptime.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  6 08:20:47 UTC 2018 - sebix@sebix.at

    creation to reduce chance of truncation.
  * print the number of probes sent by traceroute in the json
    output.
  * enforce a minimum firsthop value of 1 when reading a warts
    traceroute object.
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * choose a static ICMP checksum value when using Paris traceroute
    to reduce churn in observed topology in bdrmap output.
  * add ability to pass list of ASes to -d traces to see
    traceroutes towards specific ASes, useful for understanding
    bdrmap inferences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 19:36:27 UTC 2018 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to version 20180309:
 * sc_*:
  * For the utilities (sc_*) that read input files, do not allocate

    the file.  This improvement affects sc_ally, sc_attach,
    sc_bdrmap, sc_filterpolicy, sc_radargun, sc_speedtrap,
    sc_tbitblind, sc_tbitpmtud, sc_uptime, sc_warts2text.
 * sc_tbitpmtud:
  * add scamper driver from IMC2010 paper to collect data on webserver
    responsiveness to ICMP packet too big messages, and perform
    rudimentary analysis of collected data.
 * sc_ttlexp:
  * new utility to dump source addresses from ICMP TTL expired
    messages in warts files.
 * sc_wartsfix:
  * add a manual page
 * sc_warts2csv:
  * add a manual page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 08:40:18 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- remove new-openssl.patch, included upstream
- update to version 20171204:
 - scamper:
   * add a blind-fin tbit test, which tests receiver behavior to TCP FIN
     packets which could have come from an off-path attacker.
 - sc_radargun:
   * add -d 2 option, which dumps interface IP-ID behavior classifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 21:22:24 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- add patch new-openssl.patch to compile with new openssl versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 24 06:58:41 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to version 20170822
  scamper:
  * replace recursive versions of some functions with iterative versions.
  * add cycle-start and cycle-stop json record implementations.
  * fix traceroute json record: the hop transmit time value it reported
    was junk.
  * add support for sending json over the control socket.  use
    "attach format json" to get this mode; "attach" by itself still
    returns uuencoded warts.  Initial patch supplied by Young Hyun.
  * fix possible memory leaks detected with static analysis.
  * quality assurance on research paper cites in manual pages.
  * spelling errors noticed by Iain R. Learmonth.

  sc_ally:
  * add feature to dump inferred aliases from the collected data.

  sc_speedtrap:
  * add threaded implementation of pairwise comparison to form candidate
    alias sets, if pthreads are detected at compilation time and
    --disable-threads configure option is not supplied.

  sc_uptime:
  * new scamper driver to infer IPv6 device reboot windows if the device
    returns an incrementing identifier field in the IPv6 fragmentation
    header.  the driver is not built by default, as it expects sqlite3.
    use --with-sc_uptime configure option to build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 20:47:31 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to 20161204a
 * More fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn
 * if targets or commands are specified in a file, and that file
   ends after all probing of commands in that file has completed,
   finish the source, allowing scamper to exit.  this scenario is
   most likely when stdin is the input file.  Reported by Alex
   Colvin of Dyn
 * use select/poll/epoll/kqueue to look for read events on stdin files
 * malloc enough memory for a prefix6_t in the prefixtree code.  reported
   by Sebastian Wagner via gcc7.  only sc_bdrmap uses that code
 * increase size of string buffers for some ping and trace fields for text
   output to silence gcc7 warning.
 * allow source IP address to be null when outputting a trace with json
 * update sc_tbitblind.1 man page to show correct use of scamper's IPFW
   firewall support, which changed in the 20161204 release
 * fix unlikely unaligned access when computing checksums with IPv6
   addresses

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 20:20:18 UTC 2017 - sebix@sebix.at

- update to 20161204
 * add remote control socket support to scamper.  scamper can be
   configured to connect to a remote controller at run time to
   allow remote systems to control a scamper instance.  the
   remote controller is handled by the sc_remoted utility, and
   is documented in the sc_remoted manual page (see below).
 * fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts data files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn.
 * add a PATRICIA trie implementation based off Sedgewick's
   Algorithms in C++ book.  this improves the performance
   of scamper compared to holding addresses in splaytrees.
 * improve speed of warts(5) code.
 * improve speed of scamper_writebuf by allocating pagesize blocks
   at a time.
 * begin to document ping warts records in warts(5).
 * fix debug printf implementation so that all features will
   be built in as long as --without-debugfile is not used.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * silence compiler warnings from Microsoft Visual Studio.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * sc_prefixscan:
  * add a utility, sc_prefixscan, that provides a convenient
    interface to scamper's prefixscan alias resolution method.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_prefixscan.1.pdf
 * sc_radargun:
  * add a utility, sc_radargun, that provides a convenient
    interface to scamper's radargun implementation.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_radargun.1.pdf
 * sc_remoted:
  * add a utility, sc_remoted, that provides an interface to a
    collection of remote scamper instances.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_remoted.1.pdf
 * sc_ally:
  * use writebufs so sc_ally is event driven and will not block.
  * add code to probe candidate sets in pairs, with transitive
    closure to save probes.
  * allow inter-probe gaps of less than 1 second.
 * sc_attach:
  * add support for remote control sockets.
  * add an option to randomise the order tasks are run.
 * sc_speedtrap:
  * stricter default test for inferring if two IP addresses may
    share a single shared counter.
    backported to 20141211g.
  * code cleanup.
 * sc_warts2json
  * add support for printing ICMP extensions included in traceroute
    responses, prompted by Quirin Scheitle
