- Update to version 20230224:
 - scamper:
  - allow multiple parallel measurements to the same destination,
 -   provided the measurements have probe signatures that scamper can
 -   distinguish.
  - return the associated task ID with each DATA blob in control socket.
 -   this task ID matches the ID returned in an OK when scamper accepted
 -   the task.
  - in ping, only compute delay statistics on responses from destination.
  - in ping, allow timeout to be expressed in fractions of a second.
 - libscamperfile:
  - support reading gz-compressed warts files.
 - libscamperctrl:
  - add libscamperctrl, a library to interact with a collection of
 -   scamper instances.
  - modify sc_ally, sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_speedtrap, and
 -   sc_pinger to use this library.
  - this library is likely to evolve.  current behaviour is documented
 -   in libscamperctrl manual page.
 - misc:
  - improve sc_wartsfilter manual page with examples.
  - add remote control socket support to sc_pinger.
  - fix kqueue/epoll loop in sc_remoted.
  - consistently use size_t throughout when counting number of items.
  - build without warnings using -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter.
  - improvements through adding function attributes to printf-like
 -   functions.
  - deorbit some unused functions from utils.c.

Thu Dec 29 09:06:25 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 20211212e:
 - scamper:

    /etc/resolv.conf, or no nameserver lines in an /etc/resolv.conf
    but a measurement or scamper-internal task wants to resolve a
    name
  * tidy up buggy prinf-like statements in scamper and some drivers.
 - warts/json:
  * in JSON output for ping, print the TCP/UDP src/dst ports or
    ICMP id/seq used in individual probe packets,
  * fix regression in libscamperfile so that it can read old warts
    files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 - scamper:
  * add an option (-O cafile=/path/to/file) to load CA certificates
    from a specific file when starting scamper for validating a
    remote controller's certificate (this was released in 20211212a)
  * add options
    -O client-certfile=/path/to/certfile and
    -O client-privfile=/path/to/privfile
    to have scamper present a client certificate during a TLS handshake
    with a remote controller
  * fix bugs that prevent scamper from reconnecting to a remote
    controller
  * fix -d debugfile when scamper is built with privilege separation
  * fix bug when writing neighbordisc measurements to warts file that
    prevents a neighbordisc measurement from being read
  * fix bug when reading some tracelb measurements with unresponsive hops
    from a warts file
  * allow user to specify fractions of a second to ping timeout (-W)
  * use a random source port / ICMP ID in ping if -F 0
 - sc_remoted:
  * add -C option to specify a CA PEM file to verify client certificates
    presented by scamper instances.
  * add -O skipnameverification option to tell sc_remoted to verify
    scamper presents a certificate signed by the CA, but do not do
    name verification

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 14:13:43 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop libscamperfile1 provides from the lib subpckage:
  libscamperfile.so.2 is not a drop-in replacement for anything
  that linked libscamperfile.so.1, and as such the provides is
  invalid. The obsoletes is technically wrong, but is there to fix
  the upgrade path of a wrongly-packaged libscamperfile.so.2 in a
  libscamperfile1 package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 25 20:29:54 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- remove SIOCGSTAMP.patch
- update to version 20190916:
 * scamper
  * add a host implementation for looking up DNS records.  it uses
  the first nameserver it finds in /etc/resolv.conf by default.
  * add an -O ptr option to tracelb.
  * bugfix json output for tracelb.
  * integrate patricia trie implementation into scamper hotspot
  * use HAVE_SYSCTL macro to solve a compile issue on android
  * include <linux/sockios.h> to get SIOCGSTAMP in Linux kernel > 5.2
  * add -A option to ping code to set the ack number to use in tcp
  probes (or sequence number in SYN packets).  do not randomly
  generate sequence and ack values for each TCP ping.
  * rework options handling to allow for long long values.
  * set the window size in TCP probes to 65535, instead of advertising a
  zero receive window.
  * update configure scripts around the use of --with-privsep-dir-owner
 * sc_ally:
  * when outputting alias sets, conduct a canonical sort to allow for
  easy diffs
  * update man page because sc_ally can take more than two addresses per
  line
 * sc_erosprober:
  * new driver to periodically probe addresses and rotate output files.
 * sc_hoiho:
  * new utility for holistic orthography of Internet hostname
  observations.  this utility is only built if --with-sc_hoiho is
  passed to configure.  sc_hoiho requires pcre or pcre2, which can be
  controlled by passing --with-pcre or --with-pcre2 to configure.
 * sc_uptime:
  * add a last_tx column to state_dsts to allow for simple monitoring of
  when each destination address was last probed.
 * various drivers:
  * handle scamper disconnections gracefully in sc_ally,
  sc_filterpolicy, sc_prefixscan, sc_radargun, sc_speedtrap,
  sc_tbitblind, sc_tbitpmtud, and sc_uptime

- update to version 20181219:
 * scamper:
  * json output format for tracelb (MDA traceroute)
  * print an error message if an output file cannot be opened
  * document (in warts.5) the offset variable in a warts traceroute record,
    and scamper_trace_dtree_t
  * use autoconf to check if X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host is available,
    rather than OpenSSL #defines that are not used consistently among
    OpenSSL-like libraries.
 * libscamperfile:
  * don't crash on a zero length file, or other conditions where sf->type
    is SCAMPER_FILE_NONE
  sc_ally:
  * fix example in manual page
  * dump 3: when merging routers in a transitive closure, remove the
    obsolete router from the dump list.
  * if an address is repeated in the input file then complain
 * sc_bdrmap:
  * document -C csum in sc_bdrmap.1
  * allow duplicate prefixes in the IXP file
  * add initial support for UDP paris traceroute, as an alternative
    to the ICMP paris traceroute bdrmap uses by default.
  * document updates in sc_bdrmap.1
 * sc_ttlexp:
  * add -O noreserved
  * bugfix reading from stdin, file handling
  * document updates in sc_ttlexp.1
 * sc_uptime:
  * add an optional -I interval parameter which controls how frequently
    we want an address to be probed.  add logic to exit early if we are
    probing on with -I and there is a list of low-priority probing
    that is not empty, so that sc_uptime can meet the probe interval.
  * add the ability to expire addresses out of the database after they
    have not been seen in traceroute for a while, and they do not
    respond with an incrementing IPID value, with optional -E expiry
    parameter.
  * loading addresses into the state database is now a separate step (-a)
  * add a -c option to create and initialise a database file
  * add do-not-probe support
  * replace import code that used a row for each sample with a blob that
    stores multiple samples per blob.
  * report some measure of progress on import
  * build monotonic sequences which allow patterns in responses to be
    more easily identified, so that reboots are not falsely inferred
    in the cases of multiple counters, 16 bit counters, and routers
    that start each sequence after a PTB with a new IPID.
  * add an -O verbose to dump IPID sequences
  * document updates in sc_uptime.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    to reduce churn in observed topology in bdrmap output.
  * add ability to pass list of ASes to -d traces to see
    traceroutes towards specific ASes, useful for understanding
    bdrmap inferences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  8 19:36:27 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 20180309:
 * sc_*:
  * For the utilities (sc_*) that read input files, do not allocate
    memory to hold the entire input file in memory before parsing
    the file.  This improvement affects sc_ally, sc_attach,
    sc_bdrmap, sc_filterpolicy, sc_radargun, sc_speedtrap,
    sc_tbitblind, sc_tbitpmtud, sc_uptime, sc_warts2text.
 * sc_tbitpmtud:
  * add scamper driver from IMC2010 paper to collect data on webserver
    responsiveness to ICMP packet too big messages, and perform
    rudimentary analysis of collected data.
 * sc_ttlexp:
  * new utility to dump source addresses from ICMP TTL expired
    messages in warts files.
 * sc_wartsfix:
  * add a manual page
 * sc_warts2csv:
  * add a manual page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 08:40:18 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- remove new-openssl.patch, included upstream
- update to version 20171204:
 - scamper:
   * add a blind-fin tbit test, which tests receiver behavior to TCP FIN
     packets which could have come from an off-path attacker.
 - sc_radargun:
   * add -d 2 option, which dumps interface IP-ID behavior classifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 21:22:24 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- add patch new-openssl.patch to compile with new openssl versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 24 06:58:41 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 20170822
  scamper:
  * replace recursive versions of some functions with iterative versions.
  * add cycle-start and cycle-stop json record implementations.
  * fix traceroute json record: the hop transmit time value it reported
    was junk.
  * add support for sending json over the control socket.  use
    "attach format json" to get this mode; "attach" by itself still
    returns uuencoded warts.  Initial patch supplied by Young Hyun.
  * fix possible memory leaks detected with static analysis.
  * quality assurance on research paper cites in manual pages.
  * spelling errors noticed by Iain R. Learmonth.
  
  sc_ally:
  * add feature to dump inferred aliases from the collected data.
  
  sc_speedtrap:
  * add threaded implementation of pairwise comparison to form candidate
    alias sets, if pthreads are detected at compilation time and
    --disable-threads configure option is not supplied.
  
  sc_uptime:
  * new scamper driver to infer IPv6 device reboot windows if the device
    returns an incrementing identifier field in the IPv6 fragmentation
    header.  the driver is not built by default, as it expects sqlite3.
    use --with-sc_uptime configure option to build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 20:47:31 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 20161204a
 * More fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn
 * if targets or commands are specified in a file, and that file
   ends after all probing of commands in that file has completed,
   finish the source, allowing scamper to exit.  this scenario is
   most likely when stdin is the input file.  Reported by Alex
   Colvin of Dyn
 * use select/poll/epoll/kqueue to look for read events on stdin files
 * malloc enough memory for a prefix6_t in the prefixtree code.  reported
   by Sebastian Wagner via gcc7.  only sc_bdrmap uses that code
 * increase size of string buffers for some ping and trace fields for text
   output to silence gcc7 warning.
 * allow source IP address to be null when outputting a trace with json
 * update sc_tbitblind.1 man page to show correct use of scamper's IPFW
   firewall support, which changed in the 20161204 release
 * fix unlikely unaligned access when computing checksums with IPv6
   addresses

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 20:20:18 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to 20161204
 * add remote control socket support to scamper.  scamper can be
   configured to connect to a remote controller at run time to
   allow remote systems to control a scamper instance.  the
   remote controller is handled by the sc_remoted utility, and
   is documented in the sc_remoted manual page (see below).
 * fixes to libscamperfile caught with fuzz testing.  corrupt
   warts data files provided by Greg Ward of Dyn.
 * add a PATRICIA trie implementation based off Sedgewick's
   Algorithms in C++ book.  this improves the performance
   of scamper compared to holding addresses in splaytrees.
 * improve speed of warts(5) code.
 * improve speed of scamper_writebuf by allocating pagesize blocks
   at a time.
 * begin to document ping warts records in warts(5).
 * fix debug printf implementation so that all features will
   be built in as long as --without-debugfile is not used.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * silence compiler warnings from Microsoft Visual Studio.
   backported to 20141211g.
 * sc_prefixscan:
  * add a utility, sc_prefixscan, that provides a convenient
    interface to scamper's prefixscan alias resolution method.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_prefixscan.1.pdf
 * sc_radargun:
  * add a utility, sc_radargun, that provides a convenient
    interface to scamper's radargun implementation.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_radargun.1.pdf
 * sc_remoted:
  * add a utility, sc_remoted, that provides an interface to a
    collection of remote scamper instances.
    https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/scamper/man/sc_remoted.1.pdf
 * sc_ally:
  * use writebufs so sc_ally is event driven and will not block.
  * add code to probe candidate sets in pairs, with transitive
    closure to save probes.
  * allow inter-probe gaps of less than 1 second.
 * sc_attach:
  * add support for remote control sockets.
  * add an option to randomise the order tasks are run.
 * sc_speedtrap:
  * stricter default test for inferring if two IP addresses may
    share a single shared counter.
    backported to 20141211g.
  * code cleanup.
 * sc_warts2json
  * add support for printing ICMP extensions included in traceroute
    responses, prompted by Quirin Scheitle
