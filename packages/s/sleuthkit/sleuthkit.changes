- Version 4.0.2

New Features in Core:

    fiwalk is now included. 

Bug Fixes in Core:

    Fixed fcat to work on NTFS files (still doesn't support ADS though).
    Fixed HFS+ support in tsk_loaddb / SQLite -- root directory was not added.
    NTFS code now looks at all MFT entries when listing directory contents. It used to only look at unallocated entries for orphan files. This fixes an image that had allocated files missing from the directory b-tree.
    NTFS code uses sequence number when searching MFT entries for all files.
    Libewf detection code change to support v2 API more reliably (ID: 3596212).
    NTFS $SII code could crash in rare cases if $SDS was multiple of block size.

    Added new API to TskImgDB that returns the base name of an image.
    Numerous performance improvements to framework.
    Removed requirement in framework to specify module extension in pipeline configuration file.
    Added blackboard artifacts to represent both operating system and network service user accounts. 

Java Bindings

    More methods to query files
    Methods to get current directory when being added to DB.
    Modified class structure a bit
    More lazy loading for children / parents.
    Better exception throwing from C++ 

- Version 4.0.1

New Features:

    More DOS partition types are displayed.
    Added fcat tool that takes in file name and exports content (equivalent to using ifind and icat together).
    performance improvements with FAT code (maps and dir_add)
    performance improvements with NTFS code (maps)
    added AONLY flag to block_walk
    Updated blkls and blkcalc to use AONLY flag -- MUCH faster.

Bug Fixes:
