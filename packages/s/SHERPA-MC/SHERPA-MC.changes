  * Improve the reweighting to include the local K=BBar/B factor
    in MEPS@NLO runs (#73)

  * Adapt status=4 convention in the short HepMC output (#79)
  * Compute approximate NLO EW corrections (and subleading orders)
    as on-the-fly alternative event weights (#41). See Example in
    Manual for details. Currently only works with a
    soon-to-be-released version of OpenLoops.
  * Add a filter between the perturbative and the non-perturbative
    event phase, which can be used to reject events with
    parton-level cuts (!94)
  * Bug fixes:

    - Fix unweighting treatment for the LocalKFactor (and its
      on-the-fly variations) in negative events (#94)
    - Fix argument validation in
      GGH_KFactor_Setter::ClusterMassCorrectionFactor

- Update to 2.2.5:
  * Interface changes
    - Add preliminary support for HepMC3 (this interface is still
      being tested) 
  * New features
    - Improve decay showering off top quarks
    - Improve single-top support and add examples and documentation 
      for its production channels
    - Improve hadronisation and hadron decays for heavy flavour 
      production
    - Introduce a user hook framework which allows users to easily 
      implement

    - Add settings to output ME-only on-the-fly variations (along with 
      the full ones): 
        HEPMC_INCLUDE_ME_ONLY_VARIATIONS=1 (HepMC interface)
    - New cut-off for parton-shower reweighting: 
        CSS_REWEIGHT_SCALE_CUTOFF=<pt_min>, default: 5 GeV2
        this is more generally applicable than using a cut-off on the 
	number of reweighted emissions
    - Improve support for on-the-fly variations of clustering steps 
      (reweight each step locally instead of doing it globally)
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix issue with the overweight treatment for negative weights
    - Add missing shower weight in some event outputs, e.g. when using 
      `OUTPUT HepMC...[]`
    - Fix issue with the overweight threshold for on-the-fly variations
    - Fix issue with non-trivial beam spectra handling
    - Fix possible issues with electron-"PDF" initialization
    - Fix issue with the ISR-channel threshold for leptonic collider

      processes
    - Fix issue when using vertices with a vanishing coupling
    - Fix rare "invalid amplitude" crashes
    - Fix issues when adding limits for the number of t-channel propagators
      in matrix elements

- Add patch to fix ARM (and PPC) builds:
  * SHERPA-MC-fix_arm_build.patch
- Refresh partially upstreamed patch:
  * SHERPA-MC-no-return-in-non-void-function.patch

Fri Sep  8 11:29:07 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Upstream released a new 2.2.4 tarball, so refresh sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  2 14:19:14 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.4:
  * Interface Changes:
    - New default parameters for hadronisation model to improve
      heavy flavour production fractions and meson/baryon ratios.
    - Updates to Recola interface with some new parameter (names),
      please refer to the manual.
    - Make STRICT_METS the default scale setter to guarantee full
      scale setting accuracy for unweighted events. 
  * New features
    - Availability of DIRE NLO parton shower (cf.
      arXiv:1705.00742). This is not (yet) the default shower, in
      particular not in NLO-merged configurations.
    - Higher numerical stability in parton shower kinematics
      (re)construction.
    - Add OVERWEIGHT_THRESHOLD allowing user to cap maximal weight
      during event generation (cf. manual).
    - Avoid spuriously large weights in NLO-merged samples due to
      instable PDF ratios.
    - Add interface for hadron-level selectors.
    - Add Max_N_TChannels option in Amegic.
    - Add possibility to identify partons which originate in the
      hard decay handler.
    - Restructure gzip support such that it can be switched off at
      runtime (USE_GZIP).
    - Enable on-the-fly reweighting for calculations with the
      Higgs (Interference) add-on for HIGGS_INTERERENCE_MODE 1, 2,
      3 or 4. 
  * Bugfixes
    - Bugfix in NLO-matched parton shower emission for non-trivial
      colour structures like in V+2j@NLO. This fixes an eta
      asymmetry which was visible at the ~2% level in such
      samples.
    - BSM models through UFO: fix running coupling behaviour and
      treatment of exotic color octets.
    - Bugfix in random generator for Poisson distributions with
      large mean values.
    - Bugfixes for segfaults and compiler warnings with gcc 7.1.
    - Bugfix for colour assignment in clustering for loop-induced
      merged processes.
    - Bugfix for decay showering in conjunction with NLO+PS
      matching. 
- Change BuildRequires HepMC-devel to HepMC2-devel: not compatible
  with HepMC >= 3.0.
- Rename libSHERPA-MC-config to libSHERPA-MC0-config that follows
  the shared lib versioning. In addition the ld.so.conf.d file is
  also renamed to follow the shared lib version to make it
  possible to install multiple versions of the shared lib.
- Rebase SHERPA-MC-no-return-in-non-void-function.patch and add
  fixes for one more function showing the same issue in version
  2.2.4.
- GCC >= 6.0 required, build fails with older GCC for openSUSE <=
  1320.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 28 06:47:09 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.3:
  * Support for the Recola one-loop generator for QCD corrections.

  non-void (bool) function that was not returning any data to
  return "true".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    alpha_s variations in the matrix elements for LO, LOPS, NLOPS,
    MEPS, MENLOPS and MEPS@NLO simulations as described in
    arXiv:1606.08753 
- Changes from version 2.2.0: See

Sun Jun 22 00:41:33 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.1.1 (Bug-fix release):
  + A bug related to MC@NLO has been fixed. This will affect the
    total cross section in heavy quark production at the level of
    few permille.
  + A bug related to parton showering in associated Higgs boson
    production has been fixed.
  + A problem related to SQLite database locking on IBM BG/Q
    systems has been solved.
  + A bug related to CS subtraction with Comix has been fixed.
    This will eliminate possible large weights in events
    containing extremely soft gluons.
  + A bug related to the QED corrections on the hard interaction
    accidentally being switched off has been fixed.
  + A bug related to the contents of the HepMC::PdfInfo? object
    in MC@NLO event generation has been fixed.
  + A bug in the underlying event simulation, presenting as a final
    state particle asymmetry, has been fixed. An update of the
    underlying event parameters was necessary, invalidating MPI
    grids generated with previous versions.
  + The Python interface to access Sherpa's matrix elements has
    been updated and supplemented with a C++ interface.
  + A bug in the CS subtraction in DRED has been fixed.
- Changes from version 2.1.0:

  + Spin correlated decay chains (Comix only), includes all 1->2
    and 1->3 decays allowed by the model, iterated to arbitrary
    decay chain length, all decay steps are dressed with QCD
    parton showers and QED corrections
  + MC@NLO H events with Comix, speeds up initialisation and
    runtime
- Packaging changes:
  + Disable rivet bindings until SHERPA-MC builds with latest
    Rivet >= 2.1.2
  + BuildRequires on sqlite3-devel introduced since version 2.1.0
  + Package new binaries init_nlo.sh, make2scons, plot_graphs.sh.
