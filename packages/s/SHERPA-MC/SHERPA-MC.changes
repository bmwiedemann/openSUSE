  * Compute approximate NLO EW corrections (and subleading orders)

        this is more generally applicable than using a cut-off on the 
	number of reweighted emissions

      (reweight each step locally instead of doing it globally)
  * Bugfixes
    - Fix issue with the overweight treatment for negative weights

- Upstream released a new 2.2.4 tarball, so refresh sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  2 14:19:14 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.2.4:
  * Interface Changes:
    - New default parameters for hadronisation model to improve
      heavy flavour production fractions and meson/baryon ratios.
    - Updates to Recola interface with some new parameter (names),
      please refer to the manual.
    - Make STRICT_METS the default scale setter to guarantee full
      scale setting accuracy for unweighted events. 
  * New features
    - Availability of DIRE NLO parton shower (cf.
      arXiv:1705.00742). This is not (yet) the default shower, in
      particular not in NLO-merged configurations.
    - Higher numerical stability in parton shower kinematics
      (re)construction.
    - Add OVERWEIGHT_THRESHOLD allowing user to cap maximal weight
      during event generation (cf. manual).
    - Avoid spuriously large weights in NLO-merged samples due to
      instable PDF ratios.
    - Add interface for hadron-level selectors.
    - Add Max_N_TChannels option in Amegic.
    - Add possibility to identify partons which originate in the
      hard decay handler.
    - Restructure gzip support such that it can be switched off at
      runtime (USE_GZIP).
    - Enable on-the-fly reweighting for calculations with the
      Higgs (Interference) add-on for HIGGS_INTERERENCE_MODE 1, 2,
      3 or 4. 
  * Bugfixes
    - Bugfix in NLO-matched parton shower emission for non-trivial
      colour structures like in V+2j@NLO. This fixes an eta
      asymmetry which was visible at the ~2% level in such
      samples.
    - BSM models through UFO: fix running coupling behaviour and
      treatment of exotic color octets.
    - Bugfix in random generator for Poisson distributions with
      large mean values.
    - Bugfixes for segfaults and compiler warnings with gcc 7.1.
    - Bugfix for colour assignment in clustering for loop-induced
      merged processes.
    - Bugfix for decay showering in conjunction with NLO+PS
      matching. 
- Change BuildRequires HepMC-devel to HepMC2-devel: not compatible
  with HepMC >= 3.0.
- Rename libSHERPA-MC-config to libSHERPA-MC0-config that follows
  the shared lib versioning. In addition the ld.so.conf.d file is
  also renamed to follow the shared lib version to make it
  possible to install multiple versions of the shared lib.
- Rebase SHERPA-MC-no-return-in-non-void-function.patch and add
  fixes for one more function showing the same issue in version
  2.2.4.
- GCC >= 6.0 required, build fails with older GCC for openSUSE <=
  1320.

  return "true".

    total cross section in heavy quark production at the level of
    few permille.

    production has been fixed.
  + A problem related to SQLite database locking on IBM BG/Q
    systems has been solved.

    state particle asymmetry, has been fixed. An update of the
    underlying event parameters was necessary, invalidating MPI
    grids generated with previous versions.

    been updated and supplemented with a C++ interface.
  + A bug in the CS subtraction in DRED has been fixed.
- Changes from version 2.1.0:

  + Spin correlated decay chains (Comix only), includes all 1->2
    and 1->3 decays allowed by the model, iterated to arbitrary
    decay chain length, all decay steps are dressed with QCD
    parton showers and QED corrections
  + MC@NLO H events with Comix, speeds up initialisation and
    runtime
- Packaging changes:
  + Disable rivet bindings until SHERPA-MC builds with latest
    Rivet >= 2.1.2
  + BuildRequires on sqlite3-devel introduced since version 2.1.0
  + Package new binaries init_nlo.sh, make2scons, plot_graphs.sh.
