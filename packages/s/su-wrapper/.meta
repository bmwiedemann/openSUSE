  <title>su-wrapper Runs Programs as Another User and Group</title>
  <description>su-wrapper is a little utility that allows special users to execute
processes under another uid and gid.

It uses a table (/etc/su-wrapper.conf) to decide whatto do in certain
situation. Therefore it walks through the table and tries to match the
current situation (the later entries have precedence).
