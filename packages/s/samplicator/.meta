  <title>Send copies of (UDP) datagrams to multiple receivers</title>
  <description>This small program receives UDP datagrams on a given port, and resends
those datagrams to a specified set of receivers.
In addition, a sampling divisor N may be specified individually for each
receiver, which will then only receive one in N of the received packets.
Optional spoofing is also supported.
