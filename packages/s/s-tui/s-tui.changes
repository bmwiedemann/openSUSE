-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 21 21:50:31 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.0.0
  Graphical changes
  * There are now multiple graphs presented for each source.
    Temperature per core, usage per core etc.
  * The summaries on the side-menu present all the information
    in text form
  Control options
  * You can toggle both side-menu items and graphs on/off
  * now stores what graphs are selected of future uses
  * An average is display where applicable
  * Want the old look back: Just pick only the sensors you need
    to display one graph per sensor
  Under the hood
  * Everything was made to be a lot more modular, adding a new
    source is simply implementing all the class methods.
  Missing features
  * Some features were removed. Part of making s-tui more modular
    meant that some features that were specifically tailored to
    certain systems were removed. e.g.
    - Reading the max frequency with root for all cores
    - Displaying the max temperature recorded was removed due to
      lack of space. We intend to add another menu
      showing max/min/avg measurements recorded for all sensors
