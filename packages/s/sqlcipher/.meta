  <description>SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES
encryption of database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to
disk and are decrypted when read back. Due to the small footprint and great
performance itâ€™s ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is
well suited for mobile development.</description>
