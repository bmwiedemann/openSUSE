-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 13 13:02:46 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- update to version 5.55
  New features
    New "ticketKeySecret" and "ticketMacSecret" options to control confidentiality
      and integrity protection of the issued session tickets. These options allow for
      session resumption on other nodes in a cluster.
    Logging of the assigned bind address instead of the requested bind address.
    Check whether "output" is not a relative file name.
    Added sslVersion, sslVersionMin and sslVersionMax for OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
    Hexadecimal PSK keys are automatically converted to binary.
    Session ticket support (requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later). "connect" address
      persistence is currently unsupported with session tickets.
    SMTP HELO before authentication (thx to Jacopo Giudici).
    New "curves" option to control the list of elliptic curves in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later.
    New "ciphersuites" option to control the list of permitted TLS 1.3 ciphersuites.
    Include file name and line number in OpenSSL errors.
    Compatibility with the current OpenSSL 3.0.0-dev branch.
    Better performance with SSL_set_read_ahead()/SSL_pending().
  Bugfixes
    A number of testing framework fixes and improvements.
    Service threads are terminated before OpenSSL cleanup to prevent occasional stunnel crashes at shutdown.
    Fixed data transfer stalls introduced in stunnel 5.51.
    Fixed a transfer() loop bug introduced in stunnel 5.51.
    Fixed PSKsecrets as a global option (thx to Teodor Robas).
    Fixed a memory allocation bug (thx to matanfih).
    Fixed PSK session resumption with TLS 1.3.
    Fixed a memory leak in the WIN32 logging subsystem.
    Allow for zero value (ignored) TLS options.
    Partially refactored configuration file parsing and logging subsystems for clearer code and minor bugfixes.
  Caveats
    We removed FIPS support from our standard builds. FIPS will still be available with custom builds.
- drop stunnel-listenqueue-option.patch
  Its original purpose (from bsc#674554) was to allow setting a higher
  backlog value for listen(). As that value was raised to SOMAXCONN
  years ago (in 4.36), we don't need it anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 22 07:49:21 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop use of $FIRST_ARG in .spec

  The use of $FIRST_ARG was probably required because of the
  %service_* rpm macros were playing tricks with the shell positional
  parameters. This is bad practice and error prones so let's assume
  that no macros should do that anymore and hence it's safe to assume
  that positional parameters remains unchanged after any rpm macro
  call.

  New features

	- "OCSPaia = yes" added to the configuration file templates.

      the affected service section.
    - Documentation updates (closes Debian bug #781669).

      affected.
    - Generated temporary DH parameters are used for configuration reload instead
      of the static defaults.

    client certificate. 
  - Randomize the initial value of the round-robin counter. 
  - Added "include" configuration file option to include all configuration file
    parts located in a specified directory.

    AlFBPPS attack and bad performance of DH ciphersuites. 
  - New service-level option "redirect" to redirect SSL client connections on
    authentication failures instead of rejecting them.
  - New global "engineDefault" configuration file option to control which
    OpenSSL tasks are delegated to the current engine.

    by identifier, e.g. "engineId = capi". 
  - Improved readability of error messages printed when stunnel refuses to start

Thu Nov 24 16:19:39 UTC 2011 - darix@nordisch.org

- update to version 4.47
  * Internal improvements
    - CVE-2010-3864 workaround improved to check runtime version of
      OpenSSL rather than compiled version, and to allow OpenSSL
      0.x.x >= 0.9.8p.
    - Encoding of man page sources changed to UTF-8.
  * Bugfixes
    - Handling of socket/SSL close in transfer() function was
      fixed.
    - Logging was modified to save and restore system error codes.
    - Option "service" was restricted to Unix, as since stunnel
      4.42 it wasn't doing anything useful on Windows platform.
- additional changes from version 4.46
  * New features
    - Added Unix socket support (e.g. "connect =
      /var/run/stunnel/socket").
    - Added "verify = 4" mode to ignore CA chain and only verify
      peer certificate.
    - Removed the limit of 16 IP addresses for a single 'connect'
      option.
    - Removed the limit of 256 stunnel.conf sections in PTHREAD
      threading model. It is still not possible have more than 63
      sections on WIN32 platform.
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740141(v=vs.85).aspx
  * Optimizations
    - Reduced per-connection memory usage.
    - Performed a major refactoring of internal data structures.  Extensive
      internal testing was performed, but some regression bugs are expected.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed WIN32 compilation with Mingw32.
    - Fixed non-blocking API emulation layer in UCONTEXT threading model.
    - Fixed signal handling in UCONTEXT threading model.
- additional changes from version 4.45
  * New features
    - "protocol = proxy" support to send original client IP address to haproxy:
      http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
      This requires accept-proxy bind option of haproxy 1.5-dev3 or later.
    - Added Win32 configuration reload without a valid configuration loaded.
    - Added compatibility with LTS OpenSSL versions 0.9.6 and 0.9.7.
      Some features are only available in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later.
  * Performance optimizations
    - Use SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS if supported by the OpenSSL library.
    - Libwrap helper processes are no longer started if libwrap is disabled
      in all sections of the configuration file.
  * Internal improvements
    - Protocol negotiation framework was rewritten to support
      additional code to be executed after
      SSL_accept()/SSL_connect().
    - Handling of memory allocation errors was rewritten to
      gracefully
      terminate the process (thx to regenrecht for the idea).
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed -l option handling in stunnel3 script
      (thx to Kai Gülzau).
    - Script to build default stunnel.pem was fixed
      (thx to Sebastian Kayser).
    - MinGW compilation script (mingw.mak) was fixed
      (thx to Jose Alf).

    - Stack buffer overflow protection with -fstack-protector.
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed garbled error messages on errors with setuid/setgid
      options.
    - SNI fixes (thx to Alexey Drozdov).
    - Use after free in fdprintf() (thx to Alexey Drozdov).  This
      issue might cause GPF with "protocol" or "ident" options.

      from a specified file descriptor instead of a file.
    - accept is reported as error with [section] defined (in
      stunnel 4.04 it was silently ignored causing problems
      for lusers that did not read the fine manual).
    - Use fcntl() instead of ioctlsocket() to set socket
      nonblocking when it is supported.
    - Basic support for hardware engines with OpenSSL >= 0.9.7.
    - French manual by Bernard Choppy <choppy@imaginet.fr>.
    - Thread stack size reduced to 64KB for maximum scalability.
    - Added optional code to debug thread stack usage.
    - Support for nsr-tandem-nsk (thx to Tom Bates <tom.bates@hp.com>).
  * Bugfixes
    - TCP wrappers code moved to CRIT_NTOA critical section
      since it uses static inet_ntoa() result buffer.
    - SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL handling problems fixed.
    - added code to retry nonblocking SSL_shutdown() calls.
    - Use FD_SETSIZE instead of 16 file descriptors in inetd
      mode.
    - fdscanf groks lowercase protocol negotiation commands.
    - Libwrap detection bug in ./configure script fixed.
    - Some other minor updates.
- show readme only at first installation
