    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 110.81
  Successor ML:
  * The 110.81 release adds additional support for Successor ML
    syntactic extensions. It is now possible to use record-punning
    syntax in expressions (as well as in patterns).
  * And we have added support for do syntax in let bindings.
  * We have also changed the way that Successor ML features are
    enabled from the REPL. Instead of assigning true to the
    Control.succML variable, one should use the function
    Control.setSuccML is used to enable or disable Successor ML.
  Compiler
  * This version eliminates dependencies on FLINT types in the
    front end. In particular, uses of PlambdaType have been eliminated.
  SML/NJ Library:
  * Added the JSONUtil module to the JSON library.
  ml-lpt
  * Added --debug command-line option to ml-antlr. This flag causes
    ml-antlr to generate debug actions that print the left-hand-side
    non-terminal of the production.
  * Added %tokentype directive to ml-antlr, which allows user-defined
    datatypes to be used to represent tokens.
  MLRISC:
  * Changed the interface to AMD64Gen; the signBit and negateSignBit
    callback functions now return an MLTree.rexp (instead of a label).
  Bugfixes:
  * 129	Symbolic identifiers are allowed as strids
  * 149	Datatype replication exposes hidden constructors
  * 153	Enabling Successor ML features is delayed
  * 175	Executable stack on Linux
  * 179	ml-ulex writing debug messages to stdOut</comment>

    <time>1687722171</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- update to 110.99.3:
  * Implemented Basis Library proposal 2021-001 (Add getWindowSz
    function to Posix.TTY structure).
  * Implemented Basis Library proposal 2022-001 (Add tau to MATH signature).
  * Fix for makeml and installml scripts do not like locations with spaces.
  * Fix for Last branch of case expression omitted by PPAst.ppAst.
  * Fix for Pretty printing of Absyn in error message does not respect fixity.
  * Fix for Unable to interrupt execution by using SIGINT.
  * Fixed some interfaces that did not agree with the SML Basis
    Library specification. Bugs #318 (IEEEReal.decimal_approx
    does not match the Basis Library) and #319 (Type of
    Real.fromDecimal does not match the Basis Library).
  * Fixed bug #316 (Real.fromManExp does not return expected value if man = 0.0).
  * Fixed bug #317 (Conversion from string to real does not accept non-finite values).
  * Fixed bug #314 (IEEEReal.float_class does not match the Basis
    Library). For some reason, the NAN constructor took an
    argument in our implementation. This code was probably an
    early design of the API that was changed in the Basis Library
    specification, but not in our code.
  * Fixed bug #313 (Real.fromLargeInt crashes on large integer
    input). Changed the assembly code for the AMD64 to return
    infinity when the scaled exponent exceeds the maximum allowed
    (instead of generating an overflow).
  * Adding support for generating a SIG_GC signal when there is a garbage collection.
  * Fixed bug #314 (IEEEReal.setRoundingMode is a no-op on Linux).
  * Fixed bug #312 (CM.make is unable to handle filenames that
    contain a backslash). We have changed the semantics of paths
    given to the functions in the CM structure to be interpreted
    using the native pathname syntax (instead of CM's generic syntax).
  * Fixed bug #284 (Compiler bug: Contract: UsageMap on 132). The
    problem was the the CPSTrans.cpstrans function was generating
    code for loading spilled parameters in reverse order. In
    addition to fixing the bug, added some detailed documentation of the code.
  * Fixed bug #310 (Error when REPL tries to print value of type 
    Posix.FileSys.ST.stat).
  * Fixed bug #306 (Word8VectorSlice: mapping a subslice produces
    wrong result or crashes SML/NJ).
  * Fix a module compilation performance bug by removing packStr
    and packFct from Elaborator/modules/sigmatch.sml (reducing
    the size of that file by about 25%), and removing the call of
    packStr (in function constrStr) in Elaborator/elaborate/elabmod.
    sml, replacing it with a call to Instantiate.instAbstr.
    Goodbye at last to packStr!
  * Fix for MSI installer for SMLNJ 110.99.2 reports as version 0.0.0.0.
  * Fix for ml-build fails on Windows with error
  * support for macOS 13 (Ventura)
- includes 110.99.2:
  * Fix a benign bug where the size of a floating-point spill
    record was twice as large as necessary on 64-bit systems.
  * Split out the Real.toLargeInt implementation into target-word-
    size versions (the Real64ToIntInf module). For 64-bit targets,
    the new version uses the bit representation of the real
    number to compute the result. The 32-bit version is the old code
    that uses floating-point operations. This change fixes bug #279 (
    Real.toLargeInt returns zero for anything in range [-512,512]).
  * In the translation from Absyn to PLambda, there was a
    function (inlops) that was used to build the primop and type
    data structures for numeric types. This function was being
    called for every primitive operator, even though its results
    only depended on the numeric type. I added a hash table to cache
    the results indexed numeric kind. This change speeds up the
    compiler by about 3% (e.g., compiling the compiler went from 58s
    to 55s on a MacBookPro with a 2.4GHz Intel i9 processor).
  * support installing and running SML/NJ on macOS 12 (Monterey)
- includes 110.99.1:
  * Changed the AMD64 frame layout to include a word to hold the
    Overflow exception. This value is used by the LLVM backend to
    generate the exception for checked arithmetic operations.
  * Some minor restructuring of the logic in the generic installer.
  * Fixed a bug with how FLINT numeric types were being
    translated to CPS types. Specifically, types that were smaller
    than the default integer size (e.g., word8) should have been
    marked as having a tagged representation.
  * Fixed a serious performance bug in the implementation of the
    CharBuffer and MonoBuffer structures. Essentially, if one did
    not reserve sufficient space for the contents, it could take
    quadratic time to fill the buffer. We now grow the buffer by a
    factor of 1.5 of its current size, with an upper bound on the extra growth of 256K.
  * Fix for bug #280 (110.99 config/install.sh -64 fails on macOS
    10.15.7). I was unable to reproduce this problem, but after
    some investigation, it appears that the problem was inconsistent
    build tools being picked up from the user’s path. To protect
    against this issue, I made the paths to the ar and ranlib tools absolute.
  * Added support for running SML/NJ on M1 Macs via the Rosetta2
    emulator. The change is to identify the arm processor as amd64
    in the config/_arch-n-opsys script. Note that while the system
    basically seems to work okay under rosetta, trying to run the
    makeml command after having compiled the complier caused a crash.
