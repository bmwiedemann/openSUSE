Tue Feb 11 10:09:43 UTC 2020 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Update to version 20.02.0-0pre1, highlights are
  Highlights:
 * Exclusive behavior of a node includes all GRES on a node as well
   as the cpus.
 * Use python3 instead of python for internal build/test scripts.
   The slurm.spec file has been updated to depend on python3 as well.
 * Added new NodeSet configuration option to help simplify partition
   configuration sections for heterogeneous / condo*style clusters.
 * Added slurm.conf option MaxDBDMsgs to control how many messages will be
   stored in the slurmctld before throwing them away when the slurmdbd is down.
 * The checkpoint plugin interface and all associated API calls have been
   removed.
 * slurm_init_job_desc_msg() initializes mail_type as uint16_t. This allows
   mail_type to be set to NONE with scontrol.
 * Add new slurm_spank_log() function to print messages back to the user from
   within a SPANK plugin without prepending "error: " from slurm_error().
 * Enforce having partition name and nodelist=ALL when creating reservations
   with flags=PART_NODES.
 * SPANK - removed never-implemented slurm_spank_slurmd_init() interface. This
   hook has always been accessible through slurm_spank_init() in the
   S_CTX_SLURMD context instead.
 * sbcast - add new BcastAddr option to NodeName lines to allow sbcast traffic
   to flow over an alternate network path.
 * Added auth/jwt plugin, and 'scontrol token' subcommand.  PMIx - improve
 * performance of proc map generation.  Deprecate kill_invalid_depend in
 * SchedulerParameters and move it to a new
   option called DependencyParameters.
 * Enable job dependencies for any job on any cluster in the same federation.
 * Allow clusters to be added automatically to db at startup of ctld.  Add
 * AccountingStorageExternalHost slurm.conf parameter.  The
 * "ConditionPathExists" condition in slurmd.service has been disabled by
   default to permit simpler installation of a "configless" Slurm cluster.
 * In SchedulerParameters remove deprecated max_job_bf and replace with
   bf_max_job_test.
 * Disable sbatch, salloc, srun --reboot for non-admins.  SPANK - added support
 * for S_JOB_GID in the job script context with
   spank_get_item().
 * Prolog/Epilog - add SLURM_JOB_GID environment variable.
 configuration file changes:
 * The mpi/openmpi plugin has been removed as it does nothing.
    MpiDefault=openmpi will be translated to the functionally-equivalent
    MpiDefault=none.
 command changes (see man pages for details)
 * Display StepId=<jobid>.batch instead of StepId=<jobid>.4294967294 in output
   of "scontrol show step". (slurm_sprint_job_step_info())
 * MPMD in srun will now defer PATH resolution for the commands to launch to
   slurmstepd. Previously it would handle resolution client*side, but with
   a non*standard approach that walked PATH in reverse.
 * squeue - added "--me" option, equivalent to --user=$USER.
 * The LicensesUsed line has been removed from 'scontrol show config'.
   Please see the 'scontrol show licenses' command as an alternative.
 * sbatch - adjusted backoff times for "--wait" option to reduce load on
   slurmctld. This results in a steady*state delay of 32s between queries,
   instead of the prior 10s delay.
- Removed following deprecated patches:
  * removed patch slurmctld-rerun-agent_init-when-backup-controller-takes-over.patch
  * removed patch split-xdaemon-in-xdaemon_init-and-xdaemon_finish-for.patch
  * removed patch slurmctld-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * removed patch slurmd-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch

- BuildRequire pkgconfig(systemd) instead of systemd: allow OBS to
  shortcut through the -mini flavors.
- Use systemd_ordering instead of systemd_requires: systemd is
  never a strict requirement; but in case the system is scheduled
  for installation together with systemd, we want systemd to be
  installed prior to slurm.

- Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys:
  there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should
  be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal
  lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be
  around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).

  Fix interaction with systemd: systemd expects that a 
  daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file
  with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 11:27:31 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all
  packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle
  of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693).
  Since the %postun scripts that run on update are from
  the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work
  around the restart breakage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 13:50:14 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and 
  fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd
  depend on slurm config which provides the dir /var/run/slurm
  (bsc#1086859).

- Fix security issue in accounting_storage/mysql plugin by always escaping
  strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033
  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7033
  (bsc#1085240).
- Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451)
  Highlights of 17.11:
  * Support for federated clusters to manage a single work-flow 
    across a set of clusters.
  * Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various processor types,
    memory sizes, etc. by job component). Support for heterogeneous job
    steps within a single MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most
    configurations.
  * X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm code. Remove
    any X11 plugin configured in your plugstack.conf file to avoid errors
    being logged about conflicting options.
  * Added new advanced reservation flag of "flex", which permits jobs
    requesting the reservation to begin prior to the reservation's 
    start time and use resources inside or outside of the reservation.
    A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the
    reservation from using those reserved resources rather than forcing
    jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time
    frame reserved.
  * The sprio command has been modified to report a job's priority
    information for every partition the job has been submitted to.
  * Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid lookup on
    all compute nodes. Enable with PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration
    parameter.
  * Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to libslurmfull.so
    instead of statically linking. This dramatically reduces the
    footprint of Slurm.
  * In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and wrapped
    switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in interface calls
    in order to pass switch information between clusters with different
    switch types.
  * Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.
  * Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2 microseconds.
  * Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to fetch a job's
    batch script. Removed the ability to see the script as part of the 
    'scontrol -dd   show job' command.
  * Add new "billing" TRES which allows jobs to be limited based on the
    job's billable TRES calculated by the job's partition's
    TRESBillingWeights.
  * Regular user use of "scontrol top" command is now disabled. Use the
    configuration parameter "SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top" to
    enable that functionality. The configuration parameter
    "SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top" will be silently ignored.
  * Change default to let pending jobs run outside of reservation after
    reservation is gone to put jobs in held state. Added 
    NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation flag to use old default.
    Support for PMIx v2.0 as well as UCX support.
  * Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks:
    - lam
    - mpich1_p4
    - mpich1_shmem
    - mvapich
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
- slurmd-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch
  plugins-cgroup-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 13:43:57 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- moved config files to slurm-config package (FATE#324574).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 04:01:28 UTC 2018 - jjolly@suse.com

- Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency
- Moved config files into slurm-node
- Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node
- Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself
  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole slurm to be
    installed. The slurm-plugins seems to be a more base class
    (FATE#324574).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 14:21:49 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 10 13:52:30 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Package so-versioned libs separately. libslurm is expected
  to change more frequently and thus is packaged separately
  from libpmi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  1 16:15:04 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 20:17:47 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Updated to 16.05.8.1
 * Remove StoragePass from being printed out in the slurmdbd log at debug2
   level.
 * Defer PATH search for task program until launch in slurmstepd.
 * Modify regression test1.89 to avoid leaving vestigial job. Also reduce
    logging to reduce likelyhood of Expect buffer overflow.
 * Do not PATH search for mult-prog launches if LaunchParamters=test_exec is
    enabled.
 * Fix for possible infinite loop in select/cons_res plugin when trying to
    satisfy a job's ntasks_per_core or socket specification.
 * If job is held for bad constraints make it so once updated the job doesn't
    go into JobAdminHeld.
 * sched/backfill - Fix logic to reserve resources for jobs that require a
    node reboot (i.e. to change KNL mode) in order to start.
 * When unpacking a node or front_end record from state and the protocol
    version is lower than the min version, set it to the min.
 * Remove redundant lookup for part_ptr when updating a reservation's nodes.
 * Fix memory and file descriptor leaks in slurmd daemon's sbcast logic.
 * Do not allocate specialized cores to jobs using the --exclusive option.
 * Cancel interactive job if Prolog failure with "PrologFlags=contain" or
   "PrologFlags=alloc" configured. Send new error prolog failure message to
   the salloc or srun command as needed.
 * Prevent possible out-of-bounds read in slurmstepd on an invalid #! line.
 * Fix check for PluginDir within slurmctld to work with multiple directories.
 * Cancel interactive jobs automatically on communication error to launching
   srun/salloc process.
 * Fix security issue caused by insecure file path handling triggered by the
   failure of a Prolog script. To exploit this a user needs to anticipate or
   cause the Prolog to fail for their job. CVE-2016-10030 (bsc#1018371).
- Replace group/user add macros with function calls.
- Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in
-  pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).
- Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel
  branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has
  been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.
- Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures
  better.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  3 17:21:58 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires:  python'
- Add:
  BuildRequires:  freeipmi-devel

Tue Nov 22 21:42:04 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Fix build with and without OHCP_BUILD define.
- Fix build for systemd and non-systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  4 20:15:47 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Updated to 16-05-5 - equvalent to OpenHPC 1.2.
  * Fix issue with resizing jobs and limits not be kept track of correctly.
  * BGQ - Remove redeclaration of job_read_lock.
  * BGQ - Tighter locks around structures when nodes/cables change state.
  * Make it possible to change CPUsPerTask with scontrol.
  * Make it so scontrol update part qos= will take away a partition QOS from
    a partition.
  * Backfill scheduling properly synchronized with Cray Node Health Check.
    Prior logic could result in highest priority job getting improperly
    postponed.
  * Make it so daemons also support TopologyParam=NoInAddrAny.
  * If scancel is operating on large number of jobs and RPC responses from
    slurmctld daemon are slow then introduce a delay in sending the cancel job
    requests from scancel in order to reduce load on slurmctld.
  * Remove redundant logic when updating a job's task count.
  * MySQL - Fix querying jobs with reservations when the id's have rolled.
  * Perl - Fix use of uninitialized variable in slurm_job_step_get_pids.
  * Launch batch job requsting --reboot after the boot completes.
  * Do not attempt to power down a node which has never responded if the
    slurmctld daemon restarts without state.
  * Fix for possible slurmstepd segfault on invalid user ID.
  * MySQL - Fix for possible race condition when archiving multiple clusters
    at the same time.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Remove the SchedulerParameters option of "assoc_limit_continue", making it
    the default value. Add option of "assoc_limit_stop". If "assoc_limit_stop"
    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving
    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
  * Update a node's socket and cores per socket counts as needed after a node
    boot to reflect configuration changes which can occur on KNL processors.
    Note that the node's total core count must not change, only the distribution
    of cores across varying socket counts (KNL NUMA nodes treated as sockets by
    Slurm).
  * Rename partition configuration from "Shared" to "OverSubscribe". Rename
    salloc, sbatch, srun option from "--shared" to "--oversubscribe". The old
    options will continue to function. Output field names also changed in
    scontrol, sinfo, squeue and sview.
  * Add SLURM_UMASK environment variable to user job.
  * knl_conf: Added new configuration parameter of CapmcPollFreq.
  * Cleanup two minor Coverity warnings.
  * Make it so the tres units in a job's formatted string are converted like
    they are in a step.
  * Correct partition's MaxCPUsPerNode enforcement when nodes are shared by
    multiple partitions.
  * node_feature/knl_cray - Prevent slurmctld GRES errors for "hbm" references.
  * Display thread name instead of thread id and remove process name in stderr
    logging for "thread_id" LogTimeFormat.
  * Log IP address of bad incomming message to slurmctld.
  * If a user requests tasks, nodes and ntasks-per-node and
    tasks-per-node/nodes != tasks print warning and ignore ntasks-per-node.
  * Release CPU "owner" file locks.
  * Update seff to fix warnings with ncpus, and list slurm-perlapi dependency
    in spec file.
  * Allow QOS timelimit to override partition timelimit when EnforcePartLimits
    is set to all/any.
  * Make it so qsub will do a "basename" on a wrapped command for the output
    and error files.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Prevent job stuck in configuring state if slurmctld daemon restarted while
    PrologSlurmctld is running. Also re-issue burst_buffer/pre-load operation
    as needed.
  * Move test for job wait reason value of BurstBufferResources and
    BurstBufferStageIn later in the scheduling logic.
  * Document which srun options apply to only job, only step, or job and step
    allocations.
  * Use more compatible function to get thread name (>= 2.6.11).
  * Make it so the extern step uses a reverse tree when cleaning up.
  * If extern step doesn't get added into the proctrack plugin make sure the
    sleep is killed.
  * Add web links to Slurm Diamond Collectors (from Harvard University) and
    collectd (from EDF).
  * Add job_submit plugin for the "reboot" field.
  * Make some more Slurm constants (INFINITE, NO_VAL64, etc.) available to
    job_submit/lua plugins.
  * Send in a -1 for a taskid into spank_task_post_fork for the extern_step.
  * MYSQL - Sightly better logic if a job completion comes in with an end time
    of 0.
  * task/cgroup plugin is configured with ConstrainRAMSpace=yes, then set soft
    memory limit to allocated memory limit (previously no soft limit was set).
  * Streamline when schedule() is called when running with message aggregation
    on batch script completes.
  * Fix incorrect casting when [un]packing derived_ec on slurmdb_job_rec_t.
  * Document that persistent burst buffers can not be created or destroyed using
    the salloc or srun --bb options.
  * Add support for setting the SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT, SLURM_JOB_QOS and
    SLURM_JOB_RESERVAION environment variables are set for the salloc command.
    Document the same environment variables for the salloc, sbatch and srun
    commands in their man pages.
  * Fix issue where sacctmgr load cluster.cfg wouldn't load associations
    that had a partition in them.
  * Don't return the extern step from sstat by default.
  * In sstat print 'extern' instead of 4294967295 for the extern step.
  * Make advanced reservations work properly with core specialization.
  * slurmstepd modified to pre-load all relevant plugins at startup to avoid
    the possibility of modified plugins later resulting in inconsistent API
    or data structures and a failure of slurmstepd.
  * Export functions from parse_time.c in libslurm.so.
  * Export unit convert functions from slurm_protocol_api.c in libslurm.so.
  * Fix scancel to allow multiple steps from a job to be cancelled at once.
  * Update and expand upgrade guide (in Quick Start Administrator web page).
  * burst_buffer/cray: Requeue, but do not hold a job which fails the pre_run
    operation.
  * Insure reported expected job start time is not in the past for pending jobs.
  * Add support for PMIx v2.

  Required for FATE#316379.

Sat Oct 15 18:11:39 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- version 15.08.7.1
  * Remove the 1024-character limit on lines in batch scripts.
    task/affinity: Disable core-level task binding if more CPUs required than
    available cores.
  * Preemption/gang scheduling: If a job is suspended at slurmctld restart or
    reconfiguration time, then leave it suspended rather than resume+suspend.
  * Don't use lower weight nodes for job allocation when topology/tree used.
  * Don't allow user specified reservation names to disrupt the normal
    reservation sequeuece numbering scheme.
  * Avoid hard-link/copy of script/environment files for job arrays. Use the
    master job record file for all tasks of the job array.
    NOTE: Job arrays submitted to Slurm version 15.08.6 or later will fail if
    the slurmctld daemon is downgraded to an earlier version of Slurm.
  * In slurmctld log file, log duplicate job ID found by slurmd. Previously was
    being logged as prolog/epilog failure.
  * If a job is requeued while in the process of being launch, remove it's
    job ID from slurmd's record of active jobs in order to avoid generating a
    duplicate job ID error when launched for the second time (which would
    drain the node).
  * Cleanup messages when handling job script and environment variables in
    older directory structure formats.
  * Prevent triggering gang scheduling within a partition if configured with
    PreemptType=partition_prio and PreemptMode=suspend,gang.
  * Decrease parallelism in job cancel request to prevent denial of service
    when cancelling huge numbers of jobs.
  * If all ephemeral ports are in use, try using other port numbers.
  * Prevent "scontrol update job" from updating jobs that have already finished.
  * Show requested TRES in "squeue -O tres" when job is pending.
  * Backfill scheduler: Test association and QOS node limits before reserving
    resources for pending job.
  * Many bug fixes.

  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file
- add systemd support 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 26 10:22:32 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.03.6
  * Added support for native Slurm operation on Cray systems
    (without ALPS).
  * Added partition configuration parameters AllowAccounts,
    AllowQOS, DenyAccounts and DenyQOS to provide greater control
    over use.
  * Added the ability to perform load based scheduling. Allocating
    resources to jobs on the nodes with the largest number if idle
    CPUs.
  * Added support for reserving cores on a compute node for system
    services (core specialization)
  * Add mechanism for job_submit plugin to generate error message
    for srun, salloc or sbatch to stderr.
  * Support for Postgres database has long since been out of date
    and problematic, so it has been removed entirely.  If you
    would like to use it the code still exists in <= 2.6, but will
    not be included in this and future versions of the code.
  * Added new structures and support for both server and cluster
    resources.
  * Significant performance improvements, especially with respect
    to job array support.

Sun Mar 16 15:59:01 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- update to version 2.6.7
  * Support for job arrays, which increases performance and ease of
    use for sets of similar jobs.
  * Job profiling capability added to record a wide variety of job
    characteristics for each task on a user configurable periodic
    basis. Data currently available includes CPU use, memory use,
    energy use, Infiniband network use, Lustre file system use, etc.
  * Support for MPICH2 using PMI2 communications interface with much
    greater scalability.
  * Prolog and epilog support for advanced reservations.
  * Much faster throughput for job step execution with --exclusive
    option. The srun process is notified when resources become
    available rather than periodic polling.
  * Support improved for Intel MIC (Many Integrated Core) processor.
  * Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports
    asymmetric reservations (e.g. specific different core count for
    each node).
  * External sensor plugin infrastructure added to record power
    consumption, temperature, etc.
  * Improved performance for high-throughput computing.
  * MapReduce+ support (launches ~1000x faster, runs ~10x faster).
  * Added "MaxCPUsPerNode" partition configuration parameter. This
    can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node
    can be associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and
    "gpu") and the partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a
    subset of the node's CPUs, insuring that one or more CPUs would
    be available to jobs in the "gpu" partition/queue.

Thu Jun  6 20:31:49 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.7
  * Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning
    about undefined variable.
  * Add missing symbols to the xlator.h
  * Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill
    scheduler interactions with advanced reservation.
  * Accounting - make average by task not cpu.
  * POE - Correct logic to support poe option "-euidevice sn_all"
    and "-euidevice sn_single".
  * Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.
  * POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count
    with POE.
  * POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task
    count when the --cpus-per-task option is used without the
    --ntasks option.
  * POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.
  * sview - Fix race condition where new information could of
    slipped past the node tab and we didn't notice.
  * Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends
    data about start job to slurmdbd.
  * If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather
    than setting it down and killing all of its jobs.
  * Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.
  * POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32
    nodes)
  * Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was
    introduced in v2.5.5 (see "Reject job at submit time ...").
  * BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job
    would kill all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just
    the ones it needed to. 
  * switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.
  * BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default
    conn_types.
  * RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request
    with job running on the node within a reservation.
  * switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for
    user sn_all and sn_single options.
  * sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy
    load.
  * Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.
  * Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of "cons_res: sync
    loop not progressing, holding job #"
  * checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job
    restart.
  * launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host
    names.
  * priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.
    -- srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is
    used.
  * energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering
    energy. Since we don't currently track energy usage per task 
    (only per step). Otherwise we get double the energy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 11:13:17 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.4
  * Support for Intel® Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors.
  * User control over CPU frequency of each job step.
  * Recording power usage information for each job.
  * Advanced reservation of cores rather than whole nodes.
  * Integration with IBM's Parallel Environment including POE (Parallel
    Operating Environment) and NRT (Network Resource Table) API.
  * Highly optimized throughput for serial jobs in a new
    "select/serial" plugin.
  * CPU load is information available
  * Configurable number of CPUs available to jobs in each SLURM
    partition, which provides a mechanism to reserve CPUs for use
    with GPUs.
