- Move the ext_sensors/rrd plugin to a separate package: this
  plugin requires librrd which in turn requires huge parts of
  the client side X Window System stack.
  There is probably no use in cluttering up a system for a
  plugin that probably only used by a few.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 15:14:30 UTC 2022 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Test Suite fixes:
  * Update README_Testsuite.md.
  * Clean up left over files when de-installing test suite.
  * Adjustment to test suite package: for SLE mark the openmpi4
    devel package and slurm-hdf5 optional.
  * Add -ffat-lto-objects to the build flags when LTO is set to
    make sure the object files we ship with the test suite still
    work correctly.
  * Improve setup-testsuite.sh: copy ssh fingerprints from all nodes.

Fri Oct 14 08:49:24 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 22.05.5
- NOTE: Slurm validates that libraries are of the same version. Unfortunately,
  due to an oversight, we failed to notice that the slurmstepd loads the
  hash_k12 library only after a job has completed. This means that if the
  hash_k12 library is upgraded before a job finishes, the slurmstepd will load
  the new library when the job finishes, and will fail due to a mismatch of
  versions.  This results in nodes with slurmstepd processes stuck
  indefinitely. These processes require manual intervention to clean up. There
  is no clean way to resolve these hung slurmstepd processes.
  The only recommended way to upgrade between minor versions of 22.05 with
  RPM’s or upgrades that replace current binaries and libraries is to drain the
  nodes of running jobs first.
- Fixes a number of moderate severity issues, noteable are:
  * Load hash plugin at slurmstepd launch time to prevent issues loading the
    plugin at step completion if the Slurm installation is upgraded.
  * Update nvml plugin to match the unique id format for MIG devices in new
    Nvidia drivers.
  * Fix multi-node step launch failure when nodes in the controller aren't in
    natural order. This can happen with inconsistent node naming (such as
    node15 and node052) or with dynamic nodes which can register in any order.
  * job_container/tmpfs - cleanup containers even when the .ns file isn't
    mounted anymore.
  * Wait up to PrologEpilogTimeout before shutting down slurmd to allow prolog
    and epilog scripts to complete or timeout. Previously, slurmd waited 120
    seconds before timing out and killing prolog and epilog scripts.

Wed Nov 17 08:33:13 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 21.08.4 which fixes (CVE-2021-43337) which is only present
  in 21.08 tree.
  * CVE-2021-43337:
    For sites using the new AccountingStoreFlags=job_script and/or job_env
    options, an issue was reported with the access control rules in SlurmDBD
    that will permit users to request job scripts and environment files that
    they should not have access to. (Scripts/environments are meant to only be
    accessible by user accounts with administrator privileges, by account
    coordinators for jobs submitted under their account, and by the user
    themselves.)
- changes from 21.08.3:
  * This includes a number of fixes since the last release a month ago,
    including one critical fix to prevent a communication issue between
    slurmctld and slurmdbd for sites that have started using the new
    AccountingStoreFlags=job_script functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 21.08.2 
- major change:
  * removed of support of the TaskAffinity=yes option in cgroup.conf. Please
    consider using "TaskPlugins=cgroup,affinity" in slurm.conf as an option.
- minor changes and bugfixes:
  * slurmctld - fix how the max number of cores on a node in a partition are
    calculated when the partition contains multi*socket nodes. This in turn
    corrects certain jobs node count estimations displayed client*side.
  * job_submit/cray_aries - fix "craynetwork" GRES specification after changes
    introduced in 21.08.0rc1 that made TRES always have a type prefix.

  * accounting_storage/mysql - fix issue where querying jobs via sacct
    *-whole-hetjob=yes or slurmrestd (which automatically includes this flag)
    could in some cases return more records than expected.
  * Fix issue for preemption of job array task that makes afterok dependency
    fail. Additionally, send emails when requeueing happens due to preemption.
  * Fix sending requeue mail type.
  * Properly resize a job's GRES bitmaps and counts when resizing the job.
  * Fix node being able to transition to CLOUD state from non-cloud state.

    inherit GRES from the job when the step didn't request GRES but the job did.
  * Fix errors in logic when picking nodes based on bracketed anded constraints.
    This also enforces the requirement to have a count when using such
    constraints.
  * Handle job resize better in the database.
  * Exclude currently running, resized jobs from the runaway jobs list.
  * Make it possible to shrink a job more than once.

Thu Sep  2 13:19:33 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 21.08.0, major changes:
  * A new "AccountingStoreFlags=job_script" option to store the job scripts
    directly in SlurmDBD.
  * Added "sacct -o SubmitLine" format option to get the submit line 
    of a job/step.
  * Changes to the node state management so that nodes are marked as PLANNED
    instead of IDLE if the scheduler is still accumulating resources while
    waiting to launch a job on them.
  * RS256 token support in auth/jwt.
  * Overhaul of the cgroup subsystems to simplify operation, mitigate a number
    of inherent race conditions, and prepare for future cgroup v2 support.
  * Further improvements to cloud node power state management.
  * A new child process of the Slurm controller called "slurmscriptd"
    responsible for executing PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld scripts,
    which significantly reduces performance issues associated with enabling
    those options.
  * A new burst_buffer/lua plugin allowing for site-specific asynchronous job
    data management.
  * Fixes to the job_container/tmpfs plugin to allow the slurmd process to be
    restarted while the job is running without issue.
  * Added json/yaml output to sacct, squeue, and sinfo commands.
  * Added a new node_features/helpers plugin to provide a generic way to change
    settings on a compute node across a reboot.
  * Added support for automatically detecting and broadcasting shared libraries
    for an executable launched with "srun --bcast".
  * Added initial OCI container execution support with a new --container option
    to sbatch and srun.
  * Improved "configless" support by allowing multiple control servers to be
    specified through the slurmd --conf-server option, and send additional
    configuration files at startup including cli_filter.lua.
- minor changes:
  * If an overallocation of GRES happens terminate the creation of a job.
  * AutoDetect=nvml: Fatal if no devices found in MIG mode.
  * Print federation and cluster sacctmgr error messages to stderr.
  * Add --gpu-bind=none to disable gpu binding when using --gpus-per-task.

    display in the job correctly.
  * Fix issue in the slurmstepd SPANK prolog/epilog handler where configuration
    values were used before being initialized.

    *-gpu-bind=closest does. This removal of this behavior only was in rc2.
  * slurmd - Fix assert failure on initialization due to bad node name.
  * Fix error codes in cgroup/v1.
  * Don't destroy the memory step outside fini, which leads to a double destroy
    causing an error message.
  * Add support for lua 5.4.
  * Force cgroup.clone_children to 0 in slurm cgroup directories. This caused
    issues in task cpuset plugin in systems with it enabled by default.
  * Clear GRES HAS_TYPE flag when removing type name.
  * Environment flags in gres.conf now override flags set by AutoDetect.
  * Environment flags in gres.conf now apply to subsequent gres.conf lines where
    Environment flags are not set.
  * Set missing job_uid and job_gid members when preparing a kill_job_msg_t in
    abort_job_on_node(), abort_job_on_nodes() and kill_job_on_node().

  * srun - Fix force termination with -X.
  * On slurmctld restart set node typed GRES counts correctly.
  * Fix places where a step wasn't allocated in the slurmctld but wasn't ever
    removed from the job.
  * Fix step allocation memory when using --threads-per-core.
  * Fix step allocations to consume all threads on a core when using
    threads-per-core.
  * Add check to validate cpu request on a step if --threads-per-core is given
    and it is less than what the core on the node has in the allocation.
  * Fix issue where a step could request more gres than the job had and the step
    would hang forever. This bug was only introduced in 21.08.0rc2.
  * Only print \r\n for logging messages on stderr when --pty has been
    explicitly requested.
  * Relax check on SPANK plugins to only require Slurm major + minor versions
    to match.
  * job_container/tmpfs - delegate handling of /dev/shm to the extern step
    so new step launches will be attached correctly even after the slurmd
    process has been restarted.
  * Limit the wait time in proctrack_g_wait() to UnkillableStepTimeout instead

  * Check that the step requests at least as many gres as nodes.
  * Make job's SLURM_JOB_GPUS print global GPU IDs instead of MIG unique_ids.

  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - rename standard_in -> standard_input.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - rename standard_out -> standard_output.
  * Changed the --format handling for negative field widths (left justified)
    to apply to the column headers as well as the printed fields.
  * Add LimitFactor to the QOS. A float that is factored into an associations
    [Grp|Max]TRES limits.  For example, if the LimitFactor is 2, then an
    association with a GrpTRES of 30 CPUs, would be allowed to allocate 60
    CPUs when running under this QOS.
  * slurmrestd - Pass SLURM_NO_CHANGE_IN_DATA to client as 403 (Not Modified).

  * Make scontrol exit with non-zero status after failing to delete a partition
    or reservation.
  * Make NtasksPerTRES optional in slurm_sprint_job_info().
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Add update_time field to nodes query to allow clients
    to only get nodes list based on change timestamp.
  * common/parse_config - catch and propagate return codes when handling a match
    on a key-value pattern. This implies error codes detected in the handlers
    are now not ignored and users of _handle_keyvalue_match() can fatal().
  * common/hostlist - fix hostlist_delete_nth() xassert() upper bound check.
  * API change: Removed slurm_kill_job_msg and modified the function signature
    for slurm_kill_job2. slurm_kill_job2 should be used instead of
    slurm_kill_job_msg.
  * Fix non-zero exit code for scontrol ping when all controllers are down.
  * Enforce a valid configuration for AccountingStorageEnforce in slurm.conf.
    If the configuration is invalid, then an error message will be printed and
    the command or daemon (including slurmctld) will not run.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Add update_time field to partitions/reservations query
    to allow clients to only get the entities list when something changed.

    to reduce startup delays.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Correct displaying node states that are UNKNOWN.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Add flags to node states.
  * Fix first job on fresh cluster not being assigned JobId=1 (or FirstJobId).
  * squeue - make it so --nodelist is sensitive to --clusters.
  * squeue - do --nodelist node validation in the same order as listing.

    AccountingStoreFlags=job_comment instead.
  * AccountingStoreFlags=job_script allows you to store the job's batch script.
  * AccountingStoreFlags=job_env allows you to store the job's env vars.
  * Add sacct -o SubmitLine to get the submit line of a job/step.
  * Removed DefaultStorage{Host,Loc,Pass,Port,Type,User} options.

  * Removed CacheGroups, CheckpointType, JobCheckpointDir, MemLimitEnforce,
    SchedulerPort, SchedulerRootFilter options.
  * Make job accounting queries use consistent timeframes with and w/o jobs.
  * --cpus-per-task and --threads-per-core now imply --exact.
    This fixes issues where steps would be allocated the wrong number of CPUs.
  * configure: the --with option handling has been made consistent across the
    various optional libraries. Specifying *-with-foo=/path/to/foo will only
    check that directory for the applicable library (rather than, in some cases,
    falling back to the default directories), and will always error the build
    if the library is not found (instead of a mix of error messages and non-
    fatal warning messages).
  * configure: replace --with-rmsi_dir option with proper handling for
    *-with-rsmi=dir.
  * Pass additional job environment variables to MailProg.
  * Add SLURM_JOB_WORK_DIR to Prolog, Epilog.

    existing allocation.
  * step_ctx code has been removed from the api.
  * cli_filter/lua, jobcomp/lua, job_submit/lua now load their scripts from the
    same directory as the slurm.conf file (and thus now will respect changes
    to the SLURM_CONF environment variable).
  * SPANK - call slurm_spank_init if defined without slurm_spank_slurmd_exit in
    slurmd context.
  * job_container/tmpfs - Remove need for .active file to allow salloc without
    an interactive step to work.
  * slurmd - Delay background node registration on every failure up to 128s on
    startup.
  * slurmctld - Always notify slurmd that node registration was accepted to
    avoid slurmd needless attempting to re-register if there is configuration
    issue.
  * Put node into "INVAL" state upon registering with an invalid node
    configuration. Node must register with a valid configuration to continue.
  * Make --cpu-bind=threads default for --threads-per-core -- cli and env can
    override.
  * jobcomp/elasticsearch - Use data_t to serialize data. The plugin now has the
    JSON-C library as a prerequisite.
  * scrontab - create the temporary file under the TMPDIR environment variable
    (if set), otherwise continue to use TmpFS as configured in slurm.conf.
  * Add LastBusyTime to "scontrol show nodes" and slurmrestd nodes output,
    which represents the time the node last had jobs on it.
  * slurmd - allow multiple comma-separated controllers to be specified in
    configless mode with *-conf-server
  * sacctmgr - changed column headings to "ParentID" and "ParentName" instead
    of "Par ID" and "Par Name" respectively.
  * Perl API - make sure man pages are installed under the --prefix given to
    configure.
  * Manually powering down of nodes with scontrol now ignores
    SuspendExc<Nodes|Parts>.
  * SALLOC_THREADS_PER_CORE and SBATCH_THREADS_PER_CORE have been added as
    input environment variables for salloc and sbatch, respectively. They do
    the same thing as *-threads-per-core.
  * Distinguish queued reboot requests (REBOOT) from issued reboots (REBOOT^).
  * Set the maximum number of open files per process to 4096 to avoid
    performance issues when closing the entire range with closeall().
  * auth/jwt - add support for RS256 tokens.
  * Relax reservation purge due to any invalid uid after creation time.
  * Reject srun that requests both --exclusive and --overlap.
  * service files - change dependency to network-online rather than just
    network to ensure DNS and other services are available.
  * RSMI: Fix incorrect PCI BDF bits.
  * plugins/cli_filter - Convert to using data_t to serialize JSON.
  * Fix testing array job after regaining locks in backfill.
  * Don't display node's comment with "scontrol show nodes" unless set.
  * Add "Extra" field to node to store extra information other than a comment.
  * scrontab - Use /tmp instead of TmpFS if TMPDIR is not set.
  * Add ResumeTimeout, SuspendTimeout and SuspendTime to Partitions.
  * sreport - change to sorting TopUsage by the --tres option.
  * slurmrestd - do not run allow operation as SlurmUser/root by default.
  * Allow map_cpu and mask_cpu for non-whole node allocation.
  * TaskPluginParam=verbose is now treated as a default. Previously it would be
    applied regardless of the job specifying a *-cpu-bind.
  * Add "node_reg_mem_percent" SlurmctldParameter to define percentage of
    memory nodes are allowed to register with.
  * Show correct number of SocketsPerBoard in slurmd -C with hwloc2.
  * Alter sreport's cluster utilization report column name from
    'Reserved' to 'Planned' to match the nomenclature of the 'Planned' node.
  * Add StateComplete format option to sinfo to show base_state+flags.
  * "scontrol show node" now shows State as base_state+flags instead of
    shortened state with flags appended. eg. IDLE# *> IDLE+POWERING_UP.
    Also "POWER" state flag string is "POWERED_DOWN".
  * slurmd/req - add missing job_env_t's het_job_id initialization off the
    request in _rpc_{abort,terminate}_job(). This caused problems for Native
    Cray builds when joining a CNCU job_container plugin with Epilog configured.
  * Fix joining a CNCU job_container on a Native Cray build before executing the
    UnkillableStepProgram for a HetJob step.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.35 - Plugin has been tagged as deprecated.
  * srun - Job steps requiring more cores than available to be rejected unless
    '--overlap' is specificed.
  * Add bf_node_space_size to SchedulerParameters.
  * Add scontrol update node state=POWER_DOWN_FORCE and POWER_DOWN_ASAP as new
    ways to power off and reset especially CLOUD nodes.
  * Define and separate node power state transitions. Previously a powering
    down node was in both states, POWERING_OFF and POWERED_OFF. These are now
    separated.
  * Create a new process called slurmscriptd which runs PrologSlurmctld and
    EpilogSlurmctld. This avoids fork() calls from slurmctld, and can avoid
    performance issues if the slurmctld has a large memory footprint.
  * Added new Script option to DebugFlags for debugging slurmscriptd.
  * scrontab - add ability to update crontab from a file or standard input.
  * scrontab - add ability to set and expand variables.
  * Pass JSON of job to node mappings to ResumeProgram.
  * If running steps in an allocation with CR_PACK_NODE or -mpack the srun will
    only attempt to allocate as much as needed from the allocation instead
    of always trying to allocate every node in the allocation.
  * Jobs that request the whole node now check to see if any gres are allocated.
  * Rename SbcastParameters to BcastParameters.
  * Make srun sensitive to BcastParameters.
  * RSMI: Add gres_links_create_empty() and preserve RSMI enumeration order.
  * GPUs: Use index instead of dev_num for CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
  * Don't run epilog on nodes if job never launched.
  * QOS accrue limits only apply to the job QOS, not partition QOS.
  * Add --gpu-bind=per_task:<gpus_per_task> option, --gpus-per-task will now
    set this option by default.
  * Treat any return code from SPANK plugin that is not SLURM_SUCCESS to be an
    error or rejection.
  * Print the statistics for extern step adopted processes in sstat.
  * Fix SLURM_NODE_ALIASES to work for ipv6 node addrs.
  * Add support for automatically detecting and broadcasting executable shared
    object dependencies for sbcast and srun *-bcast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 10:13:23 UTC 2021 - Ana Guerrero Lopez <aguerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 20.11.03
- This release includes a major functional change to how job step launch is 
  handled compared to the previous 20.11 releases. This affects srun as 
  well as MPI stacks - such as Open MPI - which may use srun internally as 
  part of the process launch.
  One of the changes made in the Slurm 20.11 release was to the semantics 
  for job steps launched through the 'srun' command. This also 
  inadvertently impacts many MPI releases that use srun underneath their 
  own mpiexec/mpirun command.
  For 20.11.{0,1,2} releases, the default behavior for srun was changed  
  such that each step was allocated exactly what was requested by the 
  options given to srun, and did not have access to all resources assigned 
  to the job on the node by default. This change was equivalent to Slurm 
  setting the --exclusive option by default on all job steps. Job steps 
  desiring all resources on the node needed to explicitly request them 
  through the new '--whole' option.
  In the 20.11.3 release, we have reverted to the 20.02 and older behavior 
  of assigning all resources on a node to the job step by default.
  This reversion is a major behavioral change which we would not generally 
  do on a maintenance release, but is being done in the interest of 
  restoring compatibility with the large number of existing Open MPI (and 
  other MPI flavors) and job scripts that exist in production, and to 
  remove what has proven to be a significant hurdle in moving to the new 
  release.
  Please note that one change to step launch remains - by default, in 
  20.11 steps are no longer permitted to overlap on the resources they 
  have been assigned. If that behavior is desired, all steps must 
  explicitly opt-in through the newly added '--overlap' option.

Tue Jan  5 08:02:02 UTC 2021 - Ana Guerrero Lopez <aguerrero@suse.com>

- Add support for configuration files from external plugins. 
  While built-in plugins have their configuration added in slurm.conf,
  external SPANK plugins add their configuration to plugstack.conf
  To allow packaging easily spank plugins, their configuration files
  should be added independently at /etc/spack/plugstack.conf.d and
  plugstack.conf should be left with an oneliner including all the
  files under /etc/spack/plugstack.conf.d

    repeated reservation, and allowing for a job to be submitted and eligible
    to run within multiple reservations.
  * Dynamic Future Nodes - automatically associate a dynamically
    provisioned (or "cloud") node against a NodeName definition with matching
    hardware.

Tue Feb 11 10:09:43 UTC 2020 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Update to version 20.02.0-0pre1, highlights are
  Highlights:
 * Exclusive behavior of a node includes all GRES on a node as well
   as the cpus.
 * Use python3 instead of python for internal build/test scripts.
   The slurm.spec file has been updated to depend on python3 as well.
 * Added new NodeSet configuration option to help simplify partition
   configuration sections for heterogeneous / condo*style clusters.
 * Added slurm.conf option MaxDBDMsgs to control how many messages will be
   stored in the slurmctld before throwing them away when the slurmdbd is down.
 * The checkpoint plugin interface and all associated API calls have been
   removed.
 * slurm_init_job_desc_msg() initializes mail_type as uint16_t. This allows
   mail_type to be set to NONE with scontrol.
 * Add new slurm_spank_log() function to print messages back to the user from
   within a SPANK plugin without prepending "error: " from slurm_error().
 * Enforce having partition name and nodelist=ALL when creating reservations
   with flags=PART_NODES.
 * SPANK - removed never-implemented slurm_spank_slurmd_init() interface. This
   hook has always been accessible through slurm_spank_init() in the
   S_CTX_SLURMD context instead.
 * sbcast - add new BcastAddr option to NodeName lines to allow sbcast traffic
   to flow over an alternate network path.
 * Added auth/jwt plugin, and 'scontrol token' subcommand.  PMIx - improve
 * performance of proc map generation.  Deprecate kill_invalid_depend in
 * SchedulerParameters and move it to a new
   option called DependencyParameters.
 * Enable job dependencies for any job on any cluster in the same federation.
 * Allow clusters to be added automatically to db at startup of ctld.  Add
 * AccountingStorageExternalHost slurm.conf parameter.  The
 * "ConditionPathExists" condition in slurmd.service has been disabled by
   default to permit simpler installation of a "configless" Slurm cluster.
 * In SchedulerParameters remove deprecated max_job_bf and replace with
   bf_max_job_test.
 * Disable sbatch, salloc, srun --reboot for non-admins.  SPANK - added support
 * for S_JOB_GID in the job script context with
   spank_get_item().
 * Prolog/Epilog - add SLURM_JOB_GID environment variable.
 configuration file changes:
 * The mpi/openmpi plugin has been removed as it does nothing.
    MpiDefault=openmpi will be translated to the functionally-equivalent
    MpiDefault=none.
 command changes (see man pages for details)
 * Display StepId=<jobid>.batch instead of StepId=<jobid>.4294967294 in output
   of "scontrol show step". (slurm_sprint_job_step_info())
 * MPMD in srun will now defer PATH resolution for the commands to launch to
   slurmstepd. Previously it would handle resolution client*side, but with
   a non*standard approach that walked PATH in reverse.
 * squeue - added "--me" option, equivalent to --user=$USER.
 * The LicensesUsed line has been removed from 'scontrol show config'.
   Please see the 'scontrol show licenses' command as an alternative.
 * sbatch - adjusted backoff times for "--wait" option to reduce load on
   slurmctld. This results in a steady*state delay of 32s between queries,
   instead of the prior 10s delay.
- Removed following deprecated patches:
  * removed patch slurmctld-rerun-agent_init-when-backup-controller-takes-over.patch
  * removed patch split-xdaemon-in-xdaemon_init-and-xdaemon_finish-for.patch
  * removed patch slurmctld-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch
  * removed patch slurmd-uses-xdaemon_-for-systemd.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 19 21:05:04 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys:
  there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should
  be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal
  lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be
  around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).

  daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file
  with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 11:27:31 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all
  packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle
  of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693).
  Since the %postun scripts that run on update are from
  the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work
  around the restart breakage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 13:50:14 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and 
  fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd
  depend on slurm config which provides the dir /var/run/slurm
  (bsc#1086859).

- Fix security issue in accounting_storage/mysql plugin by always escaping
  strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033
  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7033
  (bsc#1085240).
- Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451)
  Highlights of 17.11:
  * Support for federated clusters to manage a single work-flow 
    across a set of clusters.
  * Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various processor types,
    memory sizes, etc. by job component). Support for heterogeneous job
    steps within a single MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most
    configurations.
  * X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm code. Remove
    any X11 plugin configured in your plugstack.conf file to avoid errors
    being logged about conflicting options.
  * Added new advanced reservation flag of "flex", which permits jobs
    requesting the reservation to begin prior to the reservation's 
    start time and use resources inside or outside of the reservation.
    A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the
    reservation from using those reserved resources rather than forcing
    jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time
    frame reserved.
  * The sprio command has been modified to report a job's priority
    information for every partition the job has been submitted to.
  * Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid lookup on
    all compute nodes. Enable with PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration
    parameter.
  * Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to libslurmfull.so
    instead of statically linking. This dramatically reduces the
    footprint of Slurm.
  * In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and wrapped
    switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in interface calls
    in order to pass switch information between clusters with different
    switch types.
  * Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.
  * Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2 microseconds.
  * Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to fetch a job's
    batch script. Removed the ability to see the script as part of the 
    'scontrol -dd   show job' command.
  * Add new "billing" TRES which allows jobs to be limited based on the
    job's billable TRES calculated by the job's partition's
    TRESBillingWeights.
  * Regular user use of "scontrol top" command is now disabled. Use the
    configuration parameter "SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top" to
    enable that functionality. The configuration parameter
    "SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top" will be silently ignored.
  * Change default to let pending jobs run outside of reservation after
    reservation is gone to put jobs in held state. Added 
    NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation flag to use old default.
    Support for PMIx v2.0 as well as UCX support.
  * Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks:
    - lam
    - mpich1_p4
    - mpich1_shmem
    - mvapich
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
- slurmd-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch
  plugins-cgroup-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch:
  Removed. Code upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 04:01:28 UTC 2018 - jjolly@suse.com

- Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency
- Moved config files into slurm-node
- Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node
- Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself
  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole slurm to be
    installed. The slurm-plugins seems to be a more base class
    (FATE#324574).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 14:21:49 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- split up light wight slurm-node package for deployment on nodes

 * Fix check for PluginDir within slurmctld to work with multiple directories.
 * Cancel interactive jobs automatically on communication error to launching
   srun/salloc process.
 * Fix security issue caused by insecure file path handling triggered by the
   failure of a Prolog script. To exploit this a user needs to anticipate or
   cause the Prolog to fail for their job. CVE-2016-10030 (bsc#1018371).
- Replace group/user add macros with function calls.
- Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in
-  pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).
- Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel
  branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has
  been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.
- Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures
  better.

Tue Jan  3 17:21:58 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires:  python'
- Add:
  BuildRequires:  freeipmi-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibmad-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibumad-devel
  so they are picked up by the slurm build.
- Enable modifications from openHPC Project.
- Enable lua API package build.
- Add a recommends for slurm-munge to the slurm package:
  This is way, the munge auth method is available and slurm
  works out of the box.
- Create /var/lib/slurm as StateSaveLocation directory.
  /tmp is dangerous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  4 20:15:47 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Updated to 16-05-5 - equvalent to OpenHPC 1.2.
  * Fix issue with resizing jobs and limits not be kept track of correctly.
  * BGQ - Remove redeclaration of job_read_lock.
  * BGQ - Tighter locks around structures when nodes/cables change state.
  * Make it possible to change CPUsPerTask with scontrol.
  * Make it so scontrol update part qos= will take away a partition QOS from
    a partition.
  * Backfill scheduling properly synchronized with Cray Node Health Check.
    Prior logic could result in highest priority job getting improperly
    postponed.
  * Make it so daemons also support TopologyParam=NoInAddrAny.
  * If scancel is operating on large number of jobs and RPC responses from
    slurmctld daemon are slow then introduce a delay in sending the cancel job
    requests from scancel in order to reduce load on slurmctld.
  * Remove redundant logic when updating a job's task count.
  * MySQL - Fix querying jobs with reservations when the id's have rolled.
  * Perl - Fix use of uninitialized variable in slurm_job_step_get_pids.
  * Launch batch job requsting --reboot after the boot completes.
  * Do not attempt to power down a node which has never responded if the
    slurmctld daemon restarts without state.
  * Fix for possible slurmstepd segfault on invalid user ID.
  * MySQL - Fix for possible race condition when archiving multiple clusters
    at the same time.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Remove the SchedulerParameters option of "assoc_limit_continue", making it
    the default value. Add option of "assoc_limit_stop". If "assoc_limit_stop"
    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving
    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
  * Update a node's socket and cores per socket counts as needed after a node
    boot to reflect configuration changes which can occur on KNL processors.
    Note that the node's total core count must not change, only the distribution
    of cores across varying socket counts (KNL NUMA nodes treated as sockets by
    Slurm).
  * Rename partition configuration from "Shared" to "OverSubscribe". Rename
    salloc, sbatch, srun option from "--shared" to "--oversubscribe". The old
    options will continue to function. Output field names also changed in
    scontrol, sinfo, squeue and sview.
  * Add SLURM_UMASK environment variable to user job.
  * knl_conf: Added new configuration parameter of CapmcPollFreq.
  * Cleanup two minor Coverity warnings.
  * Make it so the tres units in a job's formatted string are converted like
    they are in a step.
  * Correct partition's MaxCPUsPerNode enforcement when nodes are shared by
    multiple partitions.
  * node_feature/knl_cray - Prevent slurmctld GRES errors for "hbm" references.
  * Display thread name instead of thread id and remove process name in stderr
    logging for "thread_id" LogTimeFormat.
  * Log IP address of bad incomming message to slurmctld.
  * If a user requests tasks, nodes and ntasks-per-node and
    tasks-per-node/nodes != tasks print warning and ignore ntasks-per-node.
  * Release CPU "owner" file locks.
  * Update seff to fix warnings with ncpus, and list slurm-perlapi dependency
    in spec file.
  * Allow QOS timelimit to override partition timelimit when EnforcePartLimits
    is set to all/any.
  * Make it so qsub will do a "basename" on a wrapped command for the output
    and error files.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Prevent job stuck in configuring state if slurmctld daemon restarted while
    PrologSlurmctld is running. Also re-issue burst_buffer/pre-load operation
    as needed.
  * Move test for job wait reason value of BurstBufferResources and
    BurstBufferStageIn later in the scheduling logic.
  * Document which srun options apply to only job, only step, or job and step
    allocations.
  * Use more compatible function to get thread name (>= 2.6.11).
  * Make it so the extern step uses a reverse tree when cleaning up.
  * If extern step doesn't get added into the proctrack plugin make sure the
    sleep is killed.
  * Add web links to Slurm Diamond Collectors (from Harvard University) and
    collectd (from EDF).
  * Add job_submit plugin for the "reboot" field.
  * Make some more Slurm constants (INFINITE, NO_VAL64, etc.) available to
    job_submit/lua plugins.
  * Send in a -1 for a taskid into spank_task_post_fork for the extern_step.
  * MYSQL - Sightly better logic if a job completion comes in with an end time
    of 0.
  * task/cgroup plugin is configured with ConstrainRAMSpace=yes, then set soft
    memory limit to allocated memory limit (previously no soft limit was set).
  * Streamline when schedule() is called when running with message aggregation
    on batch script completes.
  * Fix incorrect casting when [un]packing derived_ec on slurmdb_job_rec_t.
  * Document that persistent burst buffers can not be created or destroyed using
    the salloc or srun --bb options.
  * Add support for setting the SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT, SLURM_JOB_QOS and
    SLURM_JOB_RESERVAION environment variables are set for the salloc command.
    Document the same environment variables for the salloc, sbatch and srun
    commands in their man pages.
  * Fix issue where sacctmgr load cluster.cfg wouldn't load associations
    that had a partition in them.
  * Don't return the extern step from sstat by default.
  * In sstat print 'extern' instead of 4294967295 for the extern step.
  * Make advanced reservations work properly with core specialization.
  * slurmstepd modified to pre-load all relevant plugins at startup to avoid
    the possibility of modified plugins later resulting in inconsistent API
    or data structures and a failure of slurmstepd.
  * Export functions from parse_time.c in libslurm.so.
  * Export unit convert functions from slurm_protocol_api.c in libslurm.so.
  * Fix scancel to allow multiple steps from a job to be cancelled at once.
  * Update and expand upgrade guide (in Quick Start Administrator web page).
  * burst_buffer/cray: Requeue, but do not hold a job which fails the pre_run
    operation.
  * Insure reported expected job start time is not in the past for pending jobs.
  * Add support for PMIx v2.

  Required for FATE#316379.

Mon Oct 17 13:25:52 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Setting 'download_files' service to mode='localonly'
  and adding source tarball. (Required for Factory).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 18:11:39 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- version 15.08.7.1
  * Remove the 1024-character limit on lines in batch scripts.
    task/affinity: Disable core-level task binding if more CPUs required than
    available cores.
  * Preemption/gang scheduling: If a job is suspended at slurmctld restart or
    reconfiguration time, then leave it suspended rather than resume+suspend.
  * Don't use lower weight nodes for job allocation when topology/tree used.
  * Don't allow user specified reservation names to disrupt the normal
    reservation sequeuece numbering scheme.
  * Avoid hard-link/copy of script/environment files for job arrays. Use the
    master job record file for all tasks of the job array.
    NOTE: Job arrays submitted to Slurm version 15.08.6 or later will fail if
    the slurmctld daemon is downgraded to an earlier version of Slurm.
  * In slurmctld log file, log duplicate job ID found by slurmd. Previously was
    being logged as prolog/epilog failure.
  * If a job is requeued while in the process of being launch, remove it's
    job ID from slurmd's record of active jobs in order to avoid generating a
    duplicate job ID error when launched for the second time (which would
    drain the node).
  * Cleanup messages when handling job script and environment variables in
    older directory structure formats.
  * Prevent triggering gang scheduling within a partition if configured with
    PreemptType=partition_prio and PreemptMode=suspend,gang.
  * Decrease parallelism in job cancel request to prevent denial of service
    when cancelling huge numbers of jobs.
  * If all ephemeral ports are in use, try using other port numbers.
  * Prevent "scontrol update job" from updating jobs that have already finished.
  * Show requested TRES in "squeue -O tres" when job is pending.
  * Backfill scheduler: Test association and QOS node limits before reserving
    resources for pending job.
  * Many bug fixes.
- Use source services to download package.
- Fix code for new API of hwloc-2.0.
- package netloc_to_topology where avialable.
- Package documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  1 13:45:52 UTC 2015 - scorot@free.fr

- update files list accordingly
- fix wrong end of line in some files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 19:06:18 UTC 2015 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.11.8
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file 
- update files list accordingly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  2 22:12:34 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- add missing systemd requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  2 15:04:42 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.03.9
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file
- add systemd support 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 26 10:22:32 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.03.6
  * Added support for native Slurm operation on Cray systems
    (without ALPS).
  * Added partition configuration parameters AllowAccounts,
    AllowQOS, DenyAccounts and DenyQOS to provide greater control
    over use.
  * Added the ability to perform load based scheduling. Allocating
    resources to jobs on the nodes with the largest number if idle
    CPUs.
  * Added support for reserving cores on a compute node for system
    services (core specialization)
  * Add mechanism for job_submit plugin to generate error message
    for srun, salloc or sbatch to stderr.
  * Support for Postgres database has long since been out of date
    and problematic, so it has been removed entirely.  If you
    would like to use it the code still exists in <= 2.6, but will
    not be included in this and future versions of the code.
  * Added new structures and support for both server and cluster
    resources.
  * Significant performance improvements, especially with respect
    to job array support. 
- update files list

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 16 15:59:01 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- update to version 2.6.7
  * Support for job arrays, which increases performance and ease of
    use for sets of similar jobs.
  * Job profiling capability added to record a wide variety of job
    characteristics for each task on a user configurable periodic
    basis. Data currently available includes CPU use, memory use,
    energy use, Infiniband network use, Lustre file system use, etc.
  * Support for MPICH2 using PMI2 communications interface with much
    greater scalability.
  * Prolog and epilog support for advanced reservations.
  * Much faster throughput for job step execution with --exclusive
    option. The srun process is notified when resources become
    available rather than periodic polling.
  * Support improved for Intel MIC (Many Integrated Core) processor.
  * Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports
    asymmetric reservations (e.g. specific different core count for
    each node).
  * External sensor plugin infrastructure added to record power
    consumption, temperature, etc.
  * Improved performance for high-throughput computing.
  * MapReduce+ support (launches ~1000x faster, runs ~10x faster).
  * Added "MaxCPUsPerNode" partition configuration parameter. This
    can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node
    can be associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and
    "gpu") and the partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a
    subset of the node's CPUs, insuring that one or more CPUs would
    be available to jobs in the "gpu" partition/queue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 20:31:49 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.7
  * Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning
    about undefined variable.
  * Add missing symbols to the xlator.h
  * Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill
    scheduler interactions with advanced reservation.
  * Accounting - make average by task not cpu.
  * POE - Correct logic to support poe option "-euidevice sn_all"
    and "-euidevice sn_single".
  * Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.
  * POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count
    with POE.
  * POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task
    count when the --cpus-per-task option is used without the
    --ntasks option.
  * POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.
  * sview - Fix race condition where new information could of
    slipped past the node tab and we didn't notice.
  * Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends
    data about start job to slurmdbd.
  * If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather
    than setting it down and killing all of its jobs.
  * Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.
  * POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32
    nodes)
  * Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was
    introduced in v2.5.5 (see "Reject job at submit time ...").
  * BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job
    would kill all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just
    the ones it needed to. 
  * switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.
  * BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default
    conn_types.
  * RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request
    with job running on the node within a reservation.
  * switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for
    user sn_all and sn_single options.
  * sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy
    load.
  * Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.
  * Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of "cons_res: sync
    loop not progressing, holding job #"
  * checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job
    restart.
  * launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host
    names.
  * priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.
    -- srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is
    used.
  * energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering
    energy. Since we don't currently track energy usage per task 
    (only per step). Otherwise we get double the energy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 11:13:17 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.4
  * Support for Intel® Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors.
  * User control over CPU frequency of each job step.
  * Recording power usage information for each job.
  * Advanced reservation of cores rather than whole nodes.
  * Integration with IBM's Parallel Environment including POE (Parallel
    Operating Environment) and NRT (Network Resource Table) API.
  * Highly optimized throughput for serial jobs in a new
    "select/serial" plugin.
  * CPU load is information available
  * Configurable number of CPUs available to jobs in each SLURM
    partition, which provides a mechanism to reserve CPUs for use
    with GPUs.
