Mon May 26 08:17:32 UTC 2025 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Update to version 24.11.5
  * Fix security issue where a coordinator could add a user with
	elevated privileges. CVE-2025-43904.

  * `slurmrestd` - Report an error when QOS resolution fails for
	v0.0.42 endpoints.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.42` - Added `+inline_enums` flag which
	modifies the output when generating OpenAPI specification.
	It causes enum arrays to not be defined in their own schema
	with references (`$ref`) to them. Instead they will be dumped
	inline.
  * Fix binding error with `tres-bind map/mask` on partial node
	allocations.
  * Fix `stepmgr` enabled steps being able to request features.
  * Reject step creation if requested feature is not available

	further into startup.
  * `slurmd` - Avoid `auth/slurm` related hangs of CLI commands
	during startup and shutdown.
  * `slurmctld` - Restrict processing new incoming RPC requests
	further into startup. Stop processing requests sooner during
	shutdown.
  * `slurmcltd` - Avoid auth/slurm related hangs of CLI commands
	during startup and shutdown.
  * `slurmctld` - Avoid race condition during shutdown or
	ereconfigure that could result in a crash due delayed
	processing of a connection while plugins are unloaded.
  * Fix small memleak when getting the job list from the database.

	names. The `%A` will now be substituted by the correct value.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Fix VNI range not updating on slurmctld
	restart or reconfigre.
  * Fix steps not being created when using certain combinations of
	`-c` and `-n` inferior to the jobs requested resources, when
	using stepmgr and nodes are configured with
	`CPUs == Sockets*CoresPerSocket`.
  * Permit configuring the number of retry attempts to destroy CXI
	service via the new destroy_retries `SwitchParameter`.
  * Do not reset `memory.high` and `memory.swap.max` in slurmd
	startup or reconfigure as we are never really touching this
	in `slurmd`.
  * Fix reconfigure failure of slurmd when it has been started
	manually and the `CoreSpecLimits` have been removed from
	`slurm.conf`.
  * Set or reset CoreSpec limits when slurmd is reconfigured and
	it was started with systemd.
  * `switch/hpe-slingshot` - Make sure the slurmctld can free
	step VNIs after the controller restarts or reconfigures while
	the job is running.
  * Fix backup `slurmctld` failure on 2nd takeover.
- Changes from version 24.11.4
  * `slurmctld`,`slurmrestd` - Avoid possible race condition that
    could have caused process to crash when listener socket was
    closed while accepting a new connection.
  * `slurmrestd` - Avoid race condition that could have resulted
	in address logged for a UNIX socket to be incorrect.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix parameters in OpenAPI specification for the
    following endpoints to have `job_id` field:
    ```
    GET /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs/state/
    GET /slurm/v0.0.41/jobs/state/
    GET /slurm/v0.0.42/jobs/state/
    GET /slurm/v0.0.43/jobs/state/

  * Fix jobs being scheduled on higher weighted powered down nodes.
  * Fix how backfill scheduler filters nodes from the available
	nodes based on exclusive user and `mcs_label` requirements.
  * `acct_gather_energy/{gpu,ipmi}` - Fix potential energy
	consumption adjustment calculation underflow.
  * `acct_gather_energy/ipmi` - Fix regression introduced in 24.05.5
	(which introduced the new way of preserving energy measurements
	through slurmd restarts) when `EnergyIPMICalcAdjustment=yes`.
  * Prevent `slurmctld` deadlock in the assoc mgr.
  * Fix memory leak when `RestrictedCoresPerGPU` is enabled.
  * Fix preemptor jobs not entering execution due to wrong
	calculation of accounting policy limits.
  * Fix certain job requests that were incorrectly denied with
	node configuration unavailable error.
  * `slurmd` - Avoid crash due when slurmd has a communications
	failure with `slurmstepd`.
  * Fix memory leak when parsing yaml input.
  * Prevent `slurmctld` from showing error message about `PreemptMode=GANG`
	being a cluster-wide option for `scontrol update part` calls
	that don't attempt to modify partition PreemptMode.
  * Fix setting `GANG` preemption on partition when updating
	`PreemptMode` with `scontrol`.
  * Fix `CoreSpec` and `MemSpec` limits not being removed
	from previously configured slurmd.
  * Avoid race condition that could lead to a deadlock when `slurmd`,
	`slurmstepd`, `slurmctld`, `slurmrestd` or `sackd` have a fatal
	event.
  * Fix jobs using `--ntasks-per-node` and `--mem` keep pending
	forever	when the requested mem divided by the number of CPUs
	will surpass the configured `MaxMemPerCPU`.
  * `slurmd` - Fix address logged upon new incoming RPC connection
    from `INVALID` to IP address.
  * Fix memory leak when retrieving reservations. This affects
	`scontrol`, `sinfo`, `sview`, and the following `slurmrestd`
	endpoints:
    `GET /slurm/{any_data_parser}/reservation/{reservation_name}`
    `GET /slurm/{any_data_parser}/reservations`
  * Log warning instead of `debuflags=conmgr` gated log when
	deferring new incoming connections when number of active
	connections exceed `conmgr_max_connections`.
  * Avoid race condition that could result in worker thread pool
	not activating all threads at once after a reconfigure resulting
	in lower utilization of available CPU threads until enough
	internal activity wakes up all threads in the worker pool.
  * Avoid theoretical race condition that could result in new
	incoming RPC
    socket connections being ignored after reconfigure.
  * slurmd - Avoid race condition that could result in a state
	where	new incoming RPC connections will always be ignored.
  * Add ReconfigFlags=KeepNodeStateFuture to restore saved `FUTURE`
	node state on restart and reconfig instead of reverting to
	`FUTURE` state. This will be made the default in 25.05.
  * Fix case where hetjob submit would cause `slurmctld` to crash.
  * Fix jobs using `--cpus-per-gpu` and `--mem` keep pending forever
	when the requested mem divided by the number of CPUs will surpass
	the configured `MaxMemPerCPU`.
  * Enforce that jobs using `--mem` and several `--*-per-*` options
	do not violate the `MaxMemPerCPU` in place.
  * `slurmctld` - Fix use-cases of jobs incorrectly pending held
	when `--prefer` features are not initially satisfied.
  * `slurmctld` - Fix jobs incorrectly held when `--prefer` not
	satisfied in some use-cases.
  * Ensure `RestrictedCoresPerGPU` and `CoreSpecCount` don't overlap.
- Fix backward compatibility fallout from last update.

Thu Apr 24 12:31:16 UTC 2025 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- removed openmpi4-hpc dependency for test suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  7 09:44:31 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 24.11.3:
  * Fix database cluster ID generation not being random.
  * Fix a regression in which `slurmd -G` gave no output.
  * Fix a long-standing crash in `slurmctld` after updating a
    reservation with an empty nodelist. The crash could occur
	after restarting slurmctld, or if downing/draining a node
	in the reservation with the `REPLACE` or `REPLACE_DOWN` flag.
  * Avoid changing process name to "`watch`" from original daemon name.
    This could potentially breaking some monitoring scripts.
  * Avoid `slurmctld` being killed by `SIGALRM` due to race condition
    at startup.
  * Fix race condition in slurmrestd that resulted in "`Requested
    data_parser plugin does not support OpenAPI plugin`" error being
	returned for valid endpoints.
  * Fix race between `task/cgroup` CPUset and `jobacctgather/cgroup`.
    The first was removing the pid from `task_X` cgroup directory
	causing memory limits to not being applied.
  * If multiple partitions are requested, set the `SLURM_JOB_PARTITION`
    output environment variable to the partition in which the job is
	running for `salloc` and `srun` in order to match the documentation
	and the behavior of `sbatch`.
  * `srun` - Fixed wrongly constructed `SLURM_CPU_BIND` env variable
    that could get propagated to downward srun calls in certain mpi
    environments, causing launch failures.
  * Don't print misleading errors for stepmgr enabled steps.
  * `slurmrestd` - Avoid connection to slurmdbd for the following
    endpoints:
	```
    GET /slurm/v0.0.41/jobs
    GET /slurm/v0.0.41/job/{job_id}
	```
  * `slurmrestd` - Avoid connection to slurmdbd for the following
    endpoints:
	```
    GET /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs
    GET /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}
	```
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix possible memory leak when parsing arrays with
    `data_parser/v0.0.40`.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix possible memory leak when parsing arrays with
    `data_parser/v0.0.41`.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix possible memory leak when parsing arrays with
    `data_parser/v0.0.42`.

- Changes from version 24.11.2:
  * Fix segfault when submitting `--test-only` jobs that can
    preempt.
  * Fix regression introduced in 23.11 that prevented the
    following flags from being added to a reservation on an
    update: `DAILY`, `HOURLY`, `WEEKLY`, `WEEKDAY`, and `WEEKEND`.
  * Fix crash and issues evaluating job's suitability for running
    in nodes with already suspended job(s) there.
  * `slurmctld` will ensure that healthy nodes are not reported as
    `UnavailableNodes` in job reason codes.
  * Fix handling of jobs submitted to a current reservation with
    flags `OVERLAP,FLEX` or `OVERLAP,ANY_NODES` when it overlaps nodes
    with a future maintenance reservation. When a job submission
    had a time limit that overlapped with the future maintenance
    reservation, it was rejected. Now the job is accepted but
    stays pending with the reason "`ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for
    maintenance`".
  * `pam_slurm_adopt` - avoid errors when explicitly setting some
    arguments to the default value.
  * Fix QOS preemption with `PreemptMode=SUSPEND`.
  * `slurmdbd` - When changing a user's name update lineage at the
    same time.
  * Fix regression in 24.11 in which `burst_buffer.lua` does not
    inherit the `SLURM_CONF` environment variable from `slurmctld` and
    fails to run if slurm.conf is in a non-standard location.
  * Fix memory leak in slurmctld if `select/linear` and the
    `PreemptParameters=reclaim_licenses` options are both set in
    `slurm.conf`.  Regression in 24.11.1.
  * Fix running jobs, that requested multiple partitions, from
    potentially being set to the wrong partition on restart.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Fix compatibility with newer cxi
    drivers, specifically when specifying `disable_rdzv_get`.
  * Add `ABORT_ON_FATAL` environment variable to capture a backtrace
    from any `fatal()` message.
  * Fix printing invalid address in rate limiting log statement.
  * `sched/backfill` - Fix node state `PLANNED` not being cleared from
    fully allocated nodes during a backfill cycle.
  * `select/cons_tres` - Fix future planning of jobs with
    `bf_licenses`.
  * Prevent redundant "`on_data returned rc: Rate limit exceeded,
    please retry momentarily`" error message from being printed in
    slurmctld logs.
  * Fix loading non-default QOS on pending jobs from pre-24.11
    state.
  * Fix pending jobs displaying `QOS=(null)` when not explicitly
    requesting a QOS.
  * Fix segfault issue from job record with no `job_resrcs`.
  * Fix failing `sacctmgr delete/modify/show` account operations
    with `where` clauses.
  * Fix regression in 24.11 in which Slurm daemons started
    catching several `SIGTSTP`, `SIGTTIN` and `SIGUSR1` signals and
    ignored them, while before they were not ignoring them. This
    also caused slurmctld to not being able to shutdown after a
    `SIGTSTP` because slurmscriptd caught the signal and stopped
    while slurmctld ignored it. Unify and fix these situations and
    get back to the previous behavior for these signals.
  * Document that `SIGQUIT` is no longer ignored by `slurmctld`,
    `slurmdbd`, and slurmd in 24.11. As of 24.11.0rc1, `SIGQUIT` is
    identical to `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` for these daemons, but this
    change was not documented.
  * Fix not considering nodes marked for reboot without ASAP in
    the scheduler.
  * Remove the `boot^` state on unexpected node reboot after return
    to service.
  * Do not allow new jobs to start on a node which is being
    rebooted with the flag `nextstate=resume`.
  * Prevent lower priority job running after cancelling an ASAP
    reboot.
  * Fix srun jobs starting on `nextstate=resume` rebooting nodes.
- Sync upgrades file to reflect last updated versions.
- Pass `-DH5_USE_112_API -DDH5Oget_info_vers=1` to CFLAGS to allow
  building with hdf5 1.14 as slurm does not yet support HDF5 v114
  API.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 11:51:59 UTC 2025 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Update to version 24.11.1:
  * With client commands `MIN_MEMORY` will show `mem_per_tres` if
    specified.
  * Fix errno message about bad constraint.
  * `slurmctld` - Fix crash and possible split brain issue if the
    backup controller handles an scontrol reconfigure while in control
    before the primary resumes operation.
  * Fix `stepmgr` not getting dynamic node addrs from the controller
  * `stepmgr` - avoid `Unexpected missing socket` errors.
  * Fix `scontrol show steps` with dynamic stepmgr.
  * Deny jobs using the `R:` option of `--signal` if `PreemptMode=OFF`
    globally.
  * Force jobs using the `R:` option of `--signal` to be
    preemptable.
    by requeue or cancel only. If `PreemptMode` on the partition or
    QOS is off or suspend, the job will default to using
    `PreemptMode=cancel`.
  * If `--mem-per-cpu` exceeds `MaxMemPerCPU`, the number of CPUs
    per task will always be increased even if --cpus-per-task was
    specified. This is needed to ensure each task gets the expected
    amount of memory.
  * Fix compilation issue on OpenSUSE Leap 15.
  * Fix jobs using more nodes than needed when not using `-N`.
  * Fix issue with allocation being allocated less resources.
    than needed when using `--gres-flags=enforce-binding`.
  * `select/cons_tres` - Fix errors with `MaxCpusPerSocket`
    partition limit. Used CPUs/cores weren't counted properly,
    nor limiting free ones to avail, when the socket was partially
    allocated, or the job request went beyond this limit.
  * Fix issue when jobs were preempted for licenses even if there
    were enough licenses available.
  * Fix `srun` `ntasks` calculation inside an allocation when nodes
    are requested using a min-max range.
  * Print correct number of digits for `TmpDisk` in `sdiag`.
  * Fix a regression in 24.11 which caused file transfers to a job
    with sbcast to not join the job container namespace.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Prevent a segfault in the `slurmrestd`
    when dumping data with v0.0.40+complex data parser.
  * Remove logic to force lowercase GRES names.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.42` - Prevent the association id from always
    being dumped as NULL when parsing in complex mode. Instead it
    will now dump the id. This affects the following endpoints:
    - `GET slurmdb/v0.0.42/association`
    - `GET slurmdb/v0.0.42/associations`
    - `GET slurmdb/v0.0.42/config`
  * Fixed a job requeuing issue that merged job entries into the
    same SLUID when all nodes in a job failed simultaneously.
  * When a job completes, try to give idle nodes to reservations with
    the `REPLACE` flag before allowing them to be allocated to jobs.
  * Avoid expensive lookup of all associations when dumping or
    parsing for v0.0.42 endpoints.
  * Avoid expensive lookup of all associations when dumping or
    parsing for v0.0.41 endpoints.
  * Avoid expensive lookup of all associations when dumping or
    parsing for v0.0.40 endpoints.
  * Fix segfault when testing jobs against nodes with invalid gres.
  * Fix performance regression while packing larger RPCs.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Fix Xauthoirty file being created.
    outside the container when `EntireStepInNS` is enabled.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Fix `spank_task_post_fork` not always
    running in the container when `EntireStepInNS` is enabled.
  * Fix a job potentially getting stuck in CG on permissions
    errors while setting up X11 forwarding.
  * Fix error on X11 shutdown if Xauthority file was not created.
  * `slurmctld` - Fix memory or fd leak if an RPC is recieved that
    is not registered for processing.
  * Inject `OMPI_MCA_orte_precondition_transports` when using PMIx.
    This fixes mpi apps using Intel OPA, PSM2 and OMPI 5.x when ran
    through `srun`.
  * Don't skip the first `partition_job_depth` jobs per partition.
  * Fix gres allocation issue after controller restart.
  * Fix issue where jobs requesting CPUs-per-GPU hang in queue.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Treat HTTP status forbidden the same as
    unauthorized, allowing for a graceful retry attempt.
- Slurmdbd no longer starts as root so that the systemd
  `RuntimeDirectory` option works properly. This requires further
  adjustments:
  * Use /run/slurmdbd as directory for PID file. This is created
    when slurmdbd starts by `RuntimeDirectory=slurmdbd` in the
    systemd service file (boo#1236928).
  * Upon installation, create empty `/var/log/slurmdbd.log` owned
    by user slurm as slurmdbd is not able to create it (boo#1236929).

  statements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  6 12:40:31 UTC 2025 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Update to version 24.11
  * `slurmctld` - Reject arbitrary distribution jobs that do not
    specifying a task count.
  * Fix backwards compatibility of the `RESPONSE_JOB_INFO RPC`
    (used by `squeue`, `scontrol show job`, etc.) with Slurm clients
    version 24.05 and below. This was a regression in 24.11.0rc1.
  * Do not let `slurmctld`/`slurmd` start if there are more nodes
    defined in `slurm.conf` than the maximum supported amount
    (64k nodes).
  * `slurmctld` - Set job's exit code to 1 when a job fails with
    state `JOB_NODE_FAIL`. This fixes `sbatch --wait` not being able
    to exit with error code when a job fails for this reason in
    some cases.
  * Fix certain reservation updates requested from 23.02 clients.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix populating non-required object fields of
    objects as `{}` in JSON/YAML instead of `null` causing compiled
    OpenAPI clients to reject the response to
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs` due to validation failure of
    `.jobs[].job_resources`.
  * Fix issue where older versions of Slurm talking to a 24.11 dbd
    could loose step accounting.
  * Fix minor memory leaks.
  * Fix bad memory reference when `xstrchr` fails to find char.
  * Remove duplicate checks for a data structure.
  * Fix race condition in `stepmgr` step completion handling.
  * `slurm.spec` - add ability to specify patches to apply on the
    command line.
  * `slurm.spec` - add ability to supply extra version information.
  * Fix 24.11 HA issues.
  * Fix requeued jobs keeping their priority until the decay thread
    happens.
  * Fix potential memory corruption in `select/cons_tres` plugin.
  * Avoid cache coherency issue on non-x86 platforms that could
    result in a POSIX signal being ignored or an abort().
  * `slurmctld` - Remove assertion in development builds that would
    trigger if an outdated client attempted to connect.
  * `slurmd` - Wait for `PrologEpilogTimeout` on reconfigure for
    prologs to finish. This avoids a situation where the slurmd
    never detects that the prolog completed.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Setup x11 forwarding within the namespace.
  * `slurmctld` - fix memory leak when sending a `DBD_JOB_START`
    message.
  * Fix issue with accounting rollup dealing with association tables.
  * Fix minor memory leaks.
  * Fix potential thread safety issues.
  * Init mutex in burst_buffer plugins.
  * `slurmdbd` - don't log errors when no changes occur from db
    requests.
  * `slurmcltd`,`slurmd` - Avoid deadlock during reconfigure if too
    many POSIX signals are received.
  * Improve error type logged from partial or incomplete reading
    from socket or pipe to avoid potentially logging an error from
    a previous syscall.
  * `slurmrestd` - Improve the handling of queries when unable to
    connect to slurmdbd by providing responses when possible.
  * `slurmrestd`,`sackd`,`scrun` - Avoid rare hangs related to I/O.
  * `scrun` - Add support `--all` argument for kill subcommand.
  * Remove `srun --cpu-bind=rank`.
  * Add `resource_spec/cpus` and `resource_spec/memory` entry
    points in data_parser to print the `CpuSpecList` and
    `MemSpecLimit` in `sinfo --json`.
  * `sinfo` - Add `.sinfo[].resource_spec.cpus` and
    `.sinfo[].resource_spec.memory` fields to print the `CpuSpecList`
    and `MemSpecLimit` dumped by `sinfo --{json|yaml}`.
  * Increase efficency of sending logs to syslog.
  * Switch to new official YAML mime type `application/yaml` in
    compliance with RFC9512 as primary mime type for YAML formatting.
  * `slurmrestd` - Remove deprecated fields from the following
    endpoints:
     `.result` from `POST /slurm/v0.0.42/job/submit`.  
     `.job_id`, `.step_id`, `.job_submit_user_msg` from `POST /slurm/v0.0.42/job/{job_id}`.  
     `.job.exclusive`, `.jobs[].exclusive` to `POST /slurm/v0.0.42/job/submit`.  
     `.jobs[].exclusive` from `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/job/{job_id}`.  
     `.jobs[].exclusive` from `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/jobs`.  
     `.job.oversubscribe`, `.jobs[].oversubscribe` to `POST /slurm/v0.0.42/job/submit`.  
     `.jobs[].oversubscribe` from `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/job/{job_id}`.  
     `.jobs[].oversubscribe` from `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/jobs`.  
  * `scontrol` - Removed deprecated fields `.jobs[].exclusive` and
    `.jobs[].oversubscribe` from `scontrol show jobs --{json|yaml}`.
  * `squeue` - Removed deprecated fields `.jobs[].exclusive` and
    `.jobs[].oversubscribe` from `squeue --{json|yaml}`.
  * Improve the way to run external commands and fork processes to
    avoid non-async-signal safe calls between a fork and an exec.
    We fork ourselves now and executes the commands in a safe
    environment. This includes spank prolog/epilog executions.
  * Improve `MaxMemPerCPU` enforcement when exclusive jobs request
    per node memory and the partition has heterogeneous nodes.
  * Remove a `TOCTOU` where multiple steps requesting an energy
    reading at the same time could cause too frequent accesses
    to the drivers.
  * Limit `SwitchName` to `HOST_NAME_MAX` chars length.
  * For `scancel --ctld` and the following rest api endpoints:
     `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs`  
     `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.41/jobs`  
     `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.42/jobs`  
    Support array expressions in the responses to the client.
  * `salloc` - Always output node names to the user when an
    allocation is granted.
  * `slurmrestd` - Removed all v0.0.39 endpoints.
  * `select/linear` - Reject jobs asking for GRES per
    `job|socket|task` or `cpus|mem` per GRES.
  * Add `/nodes` POST endpoint to REST API, supports multiple
    node update whereas previously only single nodes could be
    updated through `/node/<nodename>` endpoint:
    `POST /slurm/v0.0.42/nodes`
  * Do not allow changing or setting `PreemptMode=GANG` to a
    partition as this is a cluster-wide option.
  * Add `%b` as a file name pattern for the array task id modulo 10.
  * Skip packing empty nodes when they are hidden during
    `REQUEST_NODE_INFO RPC`.
  * `accounting_storage/mysql` - Avoid a fatal condition when
    the db server is not reachable.
  * Always lay out steps cyclically on nodes in an allocation.
  * `squeue` - add priority by partition
    (`.jobs[].priority_by_partition`) to JSON and YAML output.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add clarification to `failed to open slurmdbd
    connection` error if the error was the result of an
    authentication failure.
  * Make it so `slurmctld` responds to RPCs that have authentication
    errors with the `SLURM_PROTOCOL_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` error
    code.
  * `openapi/slurmctld` - Display the correct error code instead
    of `Unspecified error` if querying the following endpoints
    fails:  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.40/diag/`  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.41/diag/`  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/diag/`

    max number of concurrent steps to run at a time if threads per
    core is greater than 1.
  * In existing allocations SLURM_GPUS_PER_NODE environment
    variable will be ignored by srun if `--gpus` is specified.
  * When using `--get-user-env` explicitly or implicitly, check
    if PID or mnt namespaces are disabled and fall back to old
    logic that does not rely on them when they are not available.
  * Removed non-functional option `SLURM_PROLOG_CPU_MASK` from
    `TaskProlog` which was used to reset the affinity of a task
    based on the mask given.
  * `slurmrestd` - Support passing of `-d latest` to load latest
    version of `data_parser` plugin.
  * `sacct`,`sacctmgr`,`scontrol`,`sdiag`,`sinfo`,`squeue`,`sshare`

    `sshare`,`slurmrestd` - Avoid crash when loading `data_parser`
    plugins fail due to NULL dereference.
  * Add autodetected GPUs to the output of `slurmd -C`

    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.40/{job_id}`  
    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.41/{job_id}`  
    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.42/{job_id}`

    including job steps:  
    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.40/{job_id}`  
    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.41/{job_id}`  
    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.42/{job_id}`  
  * Alter scheduling of jobs at submission time to consider job
    submission time and job id. This makes it so that that
    interactive jobs aren't allocated resources before batch jobs
    when they have the same priority at submit time.
  * Fix multi-cluster submissions with differing Switch plugins.
  * `slurmrestd` - Change `+prefer_refs` flag to default in
    `data_parser/v0.0.42` plugin. Add `+minimize_refs` flag to
    inline single referenced schemas in the OpenAPI schema. This
    sets the default OpenAPI schema generation behavior of
    `data_parser/v0.0.42` to match v0.0.41 `+prefer_refs` and
    v0.0.40 (without flags).
  * Fix `LaunchParameters=batch_step_set_cpu_freq`.

    container without write permissions to `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
  * `cgroup/v2` - fix accounting of swap events detection.
  * Fix gathering MaxRSS for jobs that run shorter than two
    `jobacctgather` intervals. Get the metrics from cgroups
    `memory.peak` or `memory.max_usage_in_bytes` where available.
  * `openapi/slurmctld` - Set complex number support for the
    following fields:  
    `.shares[][].fairshare.factor`  
    `.shares[][].fairshare.level`  
    for endpoints:  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/shares`  
    and for commands:  
    `sshare --json`  
    `sshare --yaml`  
  * `data_parser/v0.0.42` - Avoid dumping `Infinity` for `NO_VAL`
    tagged `number` fields.

    `--nodes=<min>-<max>` for `topology/block`.
  * `sacct` - Respect `--noheader` for `--batch-script` and
    `--env-vars`.
  * `sacct` - Remove extra newline in output from `--batch-script`
    and --env-vars.

    a `NodeName`, and prevent the controller from starting if such
    a conflict exists.

    gathering logic which caused bad numbers in accounting.
  * `sackd` - retry fetching slurm configs indefinately in
    configless mode.

    to display all potential QOS's for a job's association.
  * `job_submit/lua` - Add `slurm.get_qos_priority()` function
    to retrieve the given QOS's priority.

    nodes outside of a job allocation
  * Add `DataParserParameters` `slurm.conf` parameter to allow
    setting default value for CLI `--json` and `--yaml` arguments.
  * `seff` - improve step's max memory consumption report by using
    `TresUsageInTot` and `TresUsageInAve` instead of overestimating
    the values.
  * Enable RPC queueing for `REQUEST_KILL_JOBS`, which is used when
    `scancel` is executed with `--ctld` flag.
  * `slurmdbd` - Add `-u` option. This is used to determine if
    restarting the DBD will result in database conversion.
  * Fix `srun` inside an `salloc` in a federated cluster when using
    IPv6.
  * Calculate the forwarding timeouts according to tree depth
    rather than node count / tree width for each level. Fixes race
    conditions with same timeouts between two consecutive node
    levels.
  * Add ability to submit jobs with multiple QOS.
  * Fix difference in behavior when swapping partition order in job
    submission.
  * Improve `PLANNED` state detection for mixed nodes and updating
    state before yielding backfill locks.
  * Always consider partition priority tiers when deciding to try
    scheduling jobs on submit.
  * Prevent starting jobs without reservations on submit when there
    are pending jobs with reservations that have flags `FLEX` or
    `ANY_NODES` that can be scheduled on overlapping nodes.
  * Prevent jobs that request both high and low priority tier
    partitions from starting on submit in lower priority tier
    partitions if it could delay pending jobs in higher priority
    tier partitions.
  * `scontrol` - Wait for `slurmctld` to start reconfigure in
    foreground mode before returning.
  * Improve reconfigure handling on Linux to only close open file
    descriptors to avoid long delays on systems with large
    `RLIMIT_NOFILE` settings.
  * `salloc` - Removed `--get-user-env` option.
  * Removed the instant on feature from `switch/hpe_slingshot`.
  * Hardware collectives in `switch/hpe_slingshot` now requires
    `enable_stepmgr`.
  * Allow backfill to plan jobs on nodes currently being used by
    exclusive user or mcs jobs.

    deprecated for the following endpoints:  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/{job_id}`  
    `GET /slurm/v0.0.42/jobs/`

    queue is properly flushed during shutdown.
  * Don't ship `src/slurmrestd/plugins/openapi/slurmdbd/openapi.json`

    less than `bf_resolution`.
  * Fix memory leak when requesting typed gres and
    `--[cpus|mem]-per-gpu`.
  * Prevent backfill from breaking out due to "system state
    changed" every 30 seconds if reservations use `REPLACE` or
   `REPLACE_DOWN` flags.
  * `slurmrestd` - Make sure that scheduler_unset parameter defaults
    to true even when the following flags are also set:
    `show_duplicates`, `skip_steps`, `disable_truncate_usage_time`,
    `run_away_jobs`, `whole_hetjob`, `disable_whole_hetjob`,
    `disable_wait_for_result`, `usage_time_as_submit_time`,

    v0.0.41.
  * `scancel` - Fix a regression from 23.11.6 where using both the
    `--ctld` and `--sibling` options would cancel the federated job on
    all clusters instead of only the cluster(s) specified by `--sibling`.

    `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs/` to `RequestBody` instead of using
    parameters for request. `slurmrestd` will continue accept endpoint
    requests via `RequestBody` or HTTP query.
  * `topology/tree` - Fix issues with switch distance optimization.
  * Fix potential segfault of secondary `slurmctld` when falling back
    to the primary when running with a `JobComp` plugin.

    state file.
  * Fix unnecessary message protocol downgrade for unregistered nodes.
  * Fix unnecessarily packing alias addrs when terminating jobs with
    a mix of non-cloud/dynamic nodes and powered down cloud/dynamic
    nodes.

- Changes from Slurm 24.05.2
  * Fix energy gathering rpc counter underflow in
    `_rpc_acct_gather_energy` when more than 10 threads try to get
    energy at the same time. This prevented the possibility to get
    energy from slurmd by any step until slurmd was restarted,
    so losing energy accounting metrics in the node.
  * `accounting_storage/mysql` - Fix issue where new user with `wckey`
    did not have a default wckey sent to the slurmctld.
  * `slurmrestd` - Prevent slurmrestd segfault when handling the

      `POST /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/{job_id}`
  * Fix IPMI energy gathering when no IPMIPowerSensors are specified
    in `acct_gather.conf`. This situation resulted in an accounted
    energy of 0 for job steps.
  * Fix a minor memory leak in slurmctld when updating a job dependency.
  * `scontrol`,`squeue` - Fix regression that caused incorrect values
    for multisocket nodes at `.jobs[].job_resources.nodes.allocation`

    multisocket nodes at `.jobs[].job_resources.nodes.allocation` to
    be dumped with endpoints:
      `GET /slurm/v0.0.41/job/{job_id}`

    break filtering.
  * Prevent `cpus-per-task` to be modified in jobs where a `-c`
    value has been explicitly specified and the requested memory
    constraints implicitly increase the number of CPUs to allocate.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix regression where args `-s v0.0.39,dbv0.0.39`
    and `-d v0.0.39` would result in `GET /openapi/v3` not
    registering as a valid possible query resulting in 404 errors.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix memory leak for dbv0.0.39 jobs query which
    occurred if the query parameters specified account, association,
    cluster, constraints, format, groups, job_name, partition, qos,
    reason, reservation, state, users, or wckey. This affects the
    following endpoints:
      `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/jobs`
  * `slurmrestd` - In the case the slurmdbd does not respond to a
    persistent connection init message, prevent the closed fd from
    being used, and instead emit an error or warning depending on
    if the connection was required.
  * Fix 24.05.0 regression that caused the slurmdbd not to send back
    an error message if there is an error initializing a persistent
    connection.
  * Reduce latency of forwarded x11 packets.
  * Add `curr_dependency` (representing the current dependency of
    the job).
    and `orig_dependency` (representing the original requested
    dependency of the job) fields to the job record in
    `job_submit.lua` (for job update) and `jobcomp.lua`.
  * Fix potential segfault of slurmctld configured with
    `SlurmctldParameters=enable_rpc_queue` from happening on
    reconfigure.
  * Fix potential segfault of slurmctld on its shutdown when rate
    limitting is enabled.
  * `slurmrestd` - Fix missing job environment for `SLURM_JOB_NAME`,
    `SLURM_OPEN_MODE`, `SLURM_JOB_DEPENDENCY`, `SLURM_PROFILE`,
    `SLURM_ACCTG_FREQ`, `SLURM_NETWORK` and `SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ` to
    match sbatch.
  * Fix GRES environment variable indices being incorrect when only
    using a subset of all GPUs on a node and the
    `--gres-flags=allow-task-sharing` option.
  * Prevent `scontrol` from segfaulting when requesting scontrol
    show reservation `--json` or `--yaml` if there is an error
    retrieving reservations from the `slurmctld`.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Fix security issue around managing VNI
    access. CVE-2024-42511.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Fix security issue managing IMEX channel
    access. CVE-2024-42511.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Allow for compatibility with
    `job_container/tmpfs`.
- Changes in Slurm 24.05.1
  * Fix `slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` potentially stopping instead of
    performing a logrotate when recieving `SIGUSR2` when using
    `auth/slurm`.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Fix slurmctld crash when upgrading
    from 23.02.
  * Fix "Could not find group" errors from `validate_group()` when
    using `AllowGroups` with large `/etc/group` files.
  * Add `AccountingStoreFlags=no_stdio` which allows to not record
    the stdio paths of the job when set.
  * `slurmrestd` - Prevent a slurmrestd segfault when parsing the
    `crontab` field, which was never usable. Now it explicitly
    ignores the value and emits a warning if it is used for the
    following endpoints:
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.39/job/{job_id}`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.39/job/submit`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.40/job/submit`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/{job_id}`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/submit`
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/allocate`
  * `mpi/pmi2` - Fix communication issue leading to task launch
    failure with "`invalid kvs seq from node`".
  * Fix getting user environment when using sbatch with
    `--get-user-env` or `--export=` when there is a user profile
    script that reads `/proc`.
  * Prevent slurmd from crashing if `acct_gather_energy/gpu` is
    configured but `GresTypes` is not configured.
  * Do not log the following errors when `AcctGatherEnergyType`
    plugins are used but a node does not have or cannot find sensors:
    "`error: _get_joules_task: can't get info from slurmd`"
    "`error: slurm_get_node_energy: Zero Bytes were transmitted or
     received`"
    However, the following error will continue to be logged:
    "`error: Can't get energy data. No power sensors are available.
     Try later`"
  * `sbatch`, `srun` - Set `SLURM_NETWORK` environment variable if
    `--network` is set.
  * Fix cloud nodes not being able to forward to nodes that restarted
    with new IP addresses.
  * Fix cwd not being set correctly when running a SPANK plugin with a
    `spank_user_init()` hook and the new "`contain_spank`" option set.
  * `slurmctld` - Avoid deadlock during shutdown when `auth/slurm`
    is active.
  * Fix segfault in `slurmctld` with `topology/block`.
  * `sacct` - Fix printing of job group for job steps.
  * `scrun` - Log when an invalid environment variable causes the
    job submission to be rejected.
  * `accounting_storage/mysql` - Fix problem where listing or
    modifying an association when specifying a qos list could hang
    or take a very long time.
  * `gpu/nvml` - Fix `gpuutil/gpumem` only tracking last GPU in step.
    Now, `gpuutil/gpumem` will record sums of all GPUS in the step.
  * Fix error in `scrontab` jobs when using
    `slurm.conf:PropagatePrioProcess=1`.
  * Fix `slurmctld` crash on a batch job submission with
    `--nodes 0,...`.
  * Fix dynamic IP address fanout forwarding when using `auth/slurm`.
  * Restrict listening sockets in the `mpi/pmix` plugin and `sattach`
    to the `SrunPortRange`.
  * `slurmrestd` - Limit mime types returned from query to
    `GET /openapi/v3` to only return one mime type per serializer
    plugin to fix issues with OpenAPI client generators that are
    unable to handle multiple mime type aliases.
  * Fix many commands possibly reporting an "`Unexpected Message
    Received`" when in reality the connection timed out.
  * Prevent   slurmctld  from starting if there is not a json
    serializer present and the `extra_constraints` feature is enabled.
  * Fix heterogeneous job components not being signaled with
    `scancel --ctld` and `DELETE slurm/v0.0.40/jobs` if the job ids
    are not explicitly given, the heterogeneous job components match
    the given filters, and the heterogeneous job leader does not
    match the given filters.
  * Fix regression from 23.02 impeding job licenses from being cleared.
  * Move error to `log_flag` which made `_get_joules_task` error to
    be logged to the user when too many rpcs were queued in slurmd
    for gathering energy.
  * For `scancel --ctld` and the associated rest api endpoints:
      `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.40/jobs`
      `DELETE /slurm/v0.0.41/jobs`
    Fix canceling the final array task in a job array when the task
    is pending and all array tasks have been split into separate job
    records. Previously this task was not canceled.
  * Fix `power_save operation` after recovering from a failed
    reconfigure.
  * `slurmctld` - Skip removing the pidfile when running under
    systemd. In that situation it is never created in the first place.
  * Fix issue where altering the flags on a Slurm account
    (`UsersAreCoords`) several limits on the account's association
    would be set to 0 in Slurm's internal cache.
  * Fix memory leak in the controller when relaying `stepmgr` step
    accounting to the dbd.
  * Fix segfault when submitting stepmgr jobs within an existing
    allocation.
  * Added `disable_slurm_hydra_bootstrap` as a possible `MpiParams`
    parameter in `slurm.conf`. Using this will disable env variable
    injection to allocations for the following variables:
    `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP,` `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS`,
    `HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP`, `HYDRA_LAUNCHER_EXTRA_ARGS`.
  * `scrun` - Delay shutdown until after start requested.
    This caused `scrun` to never start or shutdown and hung forever
    when using `--tty`.
  * Fix backup `slurmctld` potentially not running the agent when
    taking over as the primary controller.
  * Fix primary controller not running the agent when a reconfigure
    of the `slurmctld` fails.
  * `slurmd` - fix premature timeout waiting for
    `REQUEST_LAUNCH_PROLOG` with large array jobs causing node to
    drain.
  * `jobcomp/{elasticsearch,kafka}` - Avoid sending fields with
    invalid date/time.
  * `jobcomp/elasticsearch` - Fix `slurmctld` memory leak from
    curl usage.
  * `acct_gather_profile/influxdb` - Fix slurmstepd memory leak from
    curl usage
  * Fix 24.05.0 regression not deleting job hash dirs after
    `MinJobAge`.
  * Fix filtering arguments being ignored when using squeue `--json`.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Move setup call after `spank_init()` to
    allow namespace manipulation within the SPANK plugin.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Skip plugin operation if
    `nvidia-caps-imex-channels` device is not present rather than
    preventing slurmd from starting.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Skip plugin operation if
    `job_container/tmpfs` is configured due to incompatibility.
  * `switch/nvidia_imex` - Remove any pre-existing channels when
    `slurmd` starts.
  * `rpc_queue` - Add support for an optional `rpc_queue.yaml`
    configuration file.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add new +prefer_refs flag to `data_parser/v0.0.41`
    plugin. This flag will avoid inlining single referenced schemas
    in the OpenAPI schema.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 09:36:54 UTC 2024 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Updated to new release 24.05.0 with following major changes
  * Important Notes:
    If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update
    this first.  NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the
    primary first to do any database conversion, the backup will not
    start until this has happened.  The 24.05 slurmdbd will work
    with Slurm daemons of version 23.02 and above.  You will not
    need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
    important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before
    updating any other clusters making use of it.
  * Highlights
    + Federation - allow client command operation when slurmdbd is
      unavailable.
    + `burst_buffer/lua` - Added two new hooks: `slurm_bb_test_data_in`
      and `slurm_bb_test_data_out`. The syntax and use of the new hooks
      are documented in `etc/burst_buffer.lua.example`. These are
      required to exist. slurmctld now checks on startup if the
      `burst_buffer.lua` script loads and contains all required hooks;
      `slurmctld` will exit with a fatal error if this is not
      successful. Added `PollInterval` to `burst_buffer.conf`. Removed
      the arbitrary limit of 512 copies of the script running
      simultaneously.
    + Add QOS limit `MaxTRESRunMinsPerAccount`.
    + Add QOS limit `MaxTRESRunMinsPerUser`.
    + Add `ELIGIBLE` environment variable to `jobcomp/script` plugin.
    + Always use the QOS name for `SLURM_JOB_QOS` environment variables.
      Previously the batch environment would use the description field,
      which was usually equivalent to the name.
    + `cgroup/v2` - Require dbus-1 version >= 1.11.16.
    + Allow `NodeSet` names to be used in SuspendExcNodes.
    + `SuspendExcNodes=<nodes>:N` now counts allocated nodes in `N`.
      The first `N` powered up nodes in <nodes> are protected from
      being suspended.
    + Store job output, input and error paths in `SlurmDBD`.
    + Add `USER_DELETE` reservation flag to allow users with access
      to a reservation to delete it.
    + Add `SlurmctldParameters=enable_stepmgr` to enable step
      management through the `slurmstepd` instead of the controller.
    + Added `PrologFlags=RunInJob` to make prolog and epilog run
      inside the job extern step to include it in the job's cgroup.
    + Add ability to reserve MPI ports at the job level for stepmgr
      jobs and subdivide them at the step level.
    + `slurmrestd` - Add `--generate-openapi-spec argument`.
  * Configuration File Changes (see appropriate man page for details)
    + `CoreSpecPlugin` has been removed.
    + Removed `TopologyPlugin` tree and dragonfly support from
      `select/linear`.  If those topology plugins are desired please
      switch to `select/cons_tres`.
    + Changed the default value for `UnkillableStepTimeout` to 60
      seconds or five times the value of `MessageTimeout`, whichever
      is greater.
    + An error log has been added if `JobAcctGatherParams` '`UsePss`'
      or '`NoShare`' are configured with a plugin other than
      `jobacct_gather/linux`. In such case these parameters are ignored.
    + `helpers.conf` - Added `Flags=rebootless` parameter allowing
      feature changes without rebooting compute nodes.
    + `topology/block` - Replaced the `BlockLevels` with `BlockSizes`
      in `topology.conf`.
    + Add `contain_spank` option to `SlurmdParameters`. When set,
    `spank_user_init()`, `spank_task_post_fork()`, and
    `spank_task_exit()` will execute within the
    `job_container/tmpfs` plugin namespace.
    + Add `SlurmctldParameters=max_powered_nodes=N`, which prevents
      powering up nodes after the max is reached.
    + Add `ExclusiveTopo` to a partition definition in `slurm.conf`.
    + Add `AccountingStorageParameters=max_step_records` to limit how
      many steps are recorded in the database for each job - excluding
      batch.
  * Command Changes (see man pages for details)
    + Add support for "elevenses" as an additional time specification.
    + Add support for `sbcast --preserve` when `job_container/tmpfs`
      configured (previously documented as unsupported).
    + `scontrol` - Add new subcommand `power` for node power control.
    + `squeue` - Adjust `StdErr`, `StdOut`, and `StdIn` output formats.
      These will now consistently print "`(null)`" if a value is
      unavailable. `StdErr` will no longer display `StdOut` if it is
      not distinctly set. `StdOut` will now correctly display the
      default filename pattern for job arrays, and no longer show it
      for non-batch jobs. However, the expansion patterns will
      no longer be substituted by default.
    + Add `--segment` to job allocation to be used in topology/block.
    + Add `--exclusive=topo` for use with topology/block.
    + `squeue` - Add `--expand-patterns` option to expand `StdErr`,
      `StdOut`, `StdIn` filename patterns as best as possible.
    + `sacct` - Add `--expand-patterns` option to expand `StdErr`,
      `StdOut`, `StdIn` filename patterns as best as possible.
    + `sreport` - Requesting `format=Planned` will now return the
      expected `Planned` time as documented, instead of `PlannedDown`.
      To request `Planned Down`, one must use now `format=PLNDDown`
      or `format=PlannedDown` explicitly. The abbreviations
      "`Pl`" or "`Pla`" will now make reference to Planned instead
      of `PlannedDown`.
  * API Changes
    + Removed `ListIterator` type from `<slurm/slurm.h>`.
    + Removed `slurm_xlate_job_id()` from `<slurm/slurm.h>`
  * SLURMRESTD Changes
    + `openapi/dbv0.0.38` and `openapi/v0.0.38` plugins have been
      removed.
    + `openapi/dbv0.0.39` and `openapi/v0.0.39` plugins have been
      tagged as deprecated to warn of their removal in the next release.
    + Changed `slurmrestd.service` to only listen on TCP socket by
      default. Environments with existing drop-in units for the
      service may need further adjustments to work after upgrading.
    + `slurmrestd` - Tagged `script` field as deprecated in
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/submit` in anticipation of removal in
      future OpenAPI plugin versions. Job submissions should set the
      `job.script` (or `jobs[0].script` for HetJobs) fields instead.
    + `slurmrestd` - Attempt to automatically convert enumerated
      string arrays with  incoming non-string values into strings.
      Add warning when incoming value for enumerated string arrays
      can not be converted to string and silently ignore instead of
      rejecting entire request. This change affects any endpoint that
      uses an enunmerated string as given in the OpenAPI specification.
      An example of this conversion would be to
      `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/submit` with `.job.exclusive = true`.
      While the JSON (boolean) true value matches a possible
      enumeration, it is not the expected "true" string. This change
      automatically converts the (boolean) `true` to (string) "`true`"
      avoiding a parsing failure.
    + `slurmrestd` - Add `POST /slurm/v0.0.41/job/allocate` endpoint.
      This endpoint will create a new job allocation without any steps.
      The allocation will need to be ended via signaling the job or
      it will run to the timelimit.
    + `slurmrestd` - Allow startup when `slurmdbd` is not configured
      and avoid loading `slurmdbd` specific plugins.
  * MPI/PMI2 Changes
    + Jobs submitted with the `SLURM_HOSTFILE` environment variable
      set implies using an arbitrary distribution. Nevertheless, the
      logic used in PMI2 when generating their associated
      `PMI_process_mapping` values has been changed and will now be
      the same used for the plane distribution, as if `-m plane` were
      used. This has been changed because the original arbitrary
      distribution implementation did not account for multiple
      instances of the same host being present in `SLURM_HOSTFILE`,
      providing an incorrect process mapping in such case. This
      change also enables distributing tasks in blocks when using
      arbitrary distribution, which was not the case before. This
      only affects `mpi`/`pmi2` plugin.
- Removed Fix-test-21.41.patch as upstream test changed.
- Dropped package plugin-ext-sensors-rrd as the plugin module no
  longer exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 25 15:16:44 UTC 2024 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- removed Keep-logs-of-skipped-test-when-running-test-cases-sequentially.patch
  as incoperated upstream
- Changes in Slurm 23.02.5
  * Add the `JobId` to `debug()` messages indicating when
    `cpus_per_task/mem_per_cpu` or `pn_min_cpus` are being
    automatically adjusted.
  * Fix regression in 23.02.2 that caused `slurmctld -R` to crash on
    startup if a node features plugin is configured.
  * Fix and prevent reoccurring reservations from overlapping.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Avoid attempts to share `BasePath`
     between nodes.
  * Change the log message warning for rate limited users from
    verbose to info.
  * With `CR_Cpu_Memory`, fix node selection for jobs that request
    gres and `--mem-per-cpu`.
  * Fix a regression from 22.05.7 in which some jobs were allocated
    too few nodes, thus overcommitting cpus to some tasks.
  * Fix a job being stuck in the completing state if the job ends
    while the primary controller is down or unresponsive and the
    backup controller has not yet taken over.
  * Fix `slurmctld` segfault when a node registers with a configured
    `CpuSpecList` while slurmctld configuration has the node without
    `CpuSpecList`.
  * Fix cloud nodes getting stuck in `POWERED_DOWN+NO_RESPOND` state
    after not registering by `ResumeTimeout`.
  * `slurmstepd` - Avoid cleanup of `config.json`-less containers
    spooldir getting skipped.
  * `slurmstepd` - Cleanup per task generated environment for
    containers in spooldir.
  * Fix `scontrol segfault` when 'completing' command requested
    repeatedly in interactive mode.
  * Properly handle a race condition between `bind()` and `listen()`
    calls in the network stack when running with `SrunPortRange` set.
  * Federation - Fix revoked jobs being returned regardless of the
    `-a`/`--all` option for privileged users.
  * Federation - Fix canceling pending federated jobs from non-origin
    clusters which could leave federated jobs orphaned from the origin
    cluster.
  * Fix sinfo segfault when printing multiple clusters with
    `--noheader` option.
  * Federation - fix clusters not syncing if clusters are added to
    a federation before they have registered with the dbd.
  * Change `pmi2` plugin to honor the `SrunPortRange` option. This
    matches the new behavior of the pmix plugin in 23.02.0. Note that
    neither of these plugins makes use of the "`MpiParams=ports=`"
    option, and previously were only limited by the systems ephemeral
    port range.
  * `node_features/helpers` - Fix node selection for jobs requesting
    changeable features with the '`|`' operator, which could prevent
    jobs from running on some valid nodes.
  * `node_features/helpers` - Fix inconsistent handling of '`&`' and
    '`|`', where an AND'd feature was sometimes AND'd to all sets of
    features instead of just the current set. E.g. "`foo|bar&baz`" was
    interpreted as `{foo,baz}` or `{bar,baz}` instead of how it is
    documented: "`{foo} or {bar,baz}`".
  * Fix job accounting so that when a job is requeued its allocated
    node count is cleared. After the requeue, sacct will correctly
    show that the job has  0 `AllocNodes` while it is pending or if
    it is canceled before restarting.
  * `sacct` - `AllocCPUS` now correctly shows 0 if a job has not yet
    received an allocation or if the job was canceled before getting
    one.
  * Fix intel oneapi autodetect: detect the `/dev/dri/renderD[0-9]+`
    gpus, and do not detect `/dev/dri/card[0-9]+`.
  * Format batch, extern, interactive, and pending step ids into
    strings that are human readable.
  * Fix node selection for jobs that request `--gpus` and a number
    of tasks fewer than gpus, which resulted in incorrectly rejecting
    these jobs.
  * Remove `MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT` completely.
  * Fix cloud nodes in `POWERING_UP` state disappearing (getting set
    to `FUTURE`) when an `scontrol reconfigure` happens.
  * `openapi/dbv0.0.39` - Avoid assert / segfault on missing
    coordinators list.
  * `slurmrestd` - Correct memory leak while parsing OpenAPI
    specification templates with server overrides.
  * `slurmrestd` - Reduce memory usage when printing out job CPU
    frequency.
  * Fix overwriting user node reason with system message.
  * Remove `--uid` / `--gid` options from salloc and srun commands.
  * Prevent deadlock when rpc_queue is enabled.
  * `slurmrestd` - Correct OpenAPI specification generation bug where
    fields with overlapping parent paths would not get generated.
  * Fix memory leak as a result of a partition info query.
  * Fix memory leak as a result of a job info query.
  * slurmrestd - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/node[s]`, change format of
    node's energy field `current_watts` to a dictionary to account
    for unset value instead of dumping `4294967294`.
  * `slurmrestd` - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/qos`, change format of
    QOS's field `priority` to a dictionary to account for unset
    value instead of dumping `4294967294`.
  * `slurmrestd` - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/job[s]`, the `return code`
    code field in `v0.0.39_job_exit_code` will be set to 127 instead
    of being left unset where job does not have a relevant return code.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.39` - Add `required/memory_per_cpu` and
    required/memory_per_node to `sacct --json` and `sacct --yaml` and
    `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/jobs` from `slurmrestd`.
  * For step allocations, fix `--gres=none` sometimes not ignoring
    gres from the job.
  * Fix `--exclusive` jobs incorrectly gang-scheduling where they
    shouldn't.
  * Fix allocations with `CR_SOCKET`, gres not assigned to a specific
    socket, and block core distribion potentially allocating more
    sockets than required.
  * `gpu/oneapi` - Store cores correctly so CPU affinity is tracked.
  * Revert a change in 23.02.3 where Slurm would kill a script's
    process group as soon as the script ended instead of waiting as
    long as any process in
    that process group held the stdout/stderr file descriptors open.
    That change broke some scripts that relied on the previous
    behavior. Setting time limits for scripts (such as
    `PrologEpilogTimeout`) is strongly encouraged to avoid Slurm
    waiting indefinitely for scripts to finish.
  * Allow slurmdbd -R to work if the root assoc id is not 1.
  * Fix `slurmdbd -R` not returning an error under certain conditions.
  * `slurmdbd` - Avoid potential NULL pointer dereference in the
    mysql plugin.
  * Revert a change in 23.02 where `SLURM_NTASKS` was no longer
    set in the job's environment when `--ntasks-per-node` was
    requested.
  * Limit periodic node registrations to 50 instead of the full
   `TreeWidth`.
   Since unresolvable `cloud/dynamic` nodes must disable fanout by
   setting `TreeWidth` to a large number, this would cause all nodes
   to register at once.
  * Fix regression in 23.02.3 which broken x11 forwarding for hosts
    when `MUNGE` sends a localhost address in the encode host field.
    This is caused when the node hostname is mapped to 127.0.0.1
    (or similar) in `/etc/hosts`.
  * `openapi/[db]v0.0.39` - fix memory leak on parsing error.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.39` - fix updating qos for associations.
  * `openapi/dbv0.0.39` - fix updating values for associations with
    null users.
  * Fix minor memory leak with `--tres-per-task` and licenses.
  * Fix cyclic socket cpu distribution for tasks in a step where
    `--cpus-per-task` < usable threads per core.
- Changes in Slurm 23.02.4
  * Fix `sbatch` return code when --wait is requested on a job array.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - avoid segfault when running with old
    libcxi.
  * Avoid slurmctld segfault when specifying
    `AccountingStorageExternalHost`.
  * Fix collected `GPUUtilization` values for `acct_gather_profile`
    plugins.
  * Fix slurmrestd handling of job hold/release operations.
  * Make spank `S_JOB_ARGV` item value hold the requested command
    argv instead of the srun `--bcast` value when `--bcast` requested
    (only in local context).
  * Fix step running indefinitely when slurmctld takes more than
    `MessageTimeout` to respond. Now, `slurmctld` will cancel the
    step when detected, preventing following steps from getting stuck
    waiting for resources to be released.
  * Fix regression to make job_desc.min_cpus accurate again in
    job_submit when requesting a job with `--ntasks-per-node`.
  * `scontrol` - Permit changes to `StdErr` and `StdIn` for pending
    jobs.
  * `scontrol` - Reset std{err,in,out} when set to empty string.
  * `slurmrestd` - mark environment as a required field for job
     submission descriptions.
  * `slurmrestd` - avoid dumping null in OpenAPI schema required
    fields.
    `data_parser/v0.0.39` - avoid rejecting valid `memory_per_node`
    formatted as dictionary provided with a job description.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.39` - avoid rejecting valid `memory_per_cpu`
    formatted as dictionary provided with a job description.
  * `slurmrestd` - Return HTTP error code 404 when job query fails.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add return schema to error response to job and
    license query.
  * Fix handling of ArrayTaskThrottle in backfill.
  * Fix regression in 23.02.2 when checking gres state on `slurmctld`
    startup or  reconfigure. Gres changes in the configuration were
    not updated on `slurmctld` startup. On startup or reconfigure,
    these messages were present in the log:
    "`error: Attempt to change gres/gpu Count`".
  * Fix potential double count of gres when dealing with limits.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - support alternate traffic class names
    with "`TC_`"  prefix.
  * `scrontab` - Fix cutting off the final character of quoted
    variables.
  * Fix `slurmstepd` segfault when `ContainerPath` is not set in
    `oci.conf`.
  * Change the log message warning for rate limited users from
    debug to verbose.
  * Fixed an issue where jobs requesting licenses were incorrectly
    rejected.
  * `smail` - Fix issues where emails at job completion were not
    being sent.
  * `scontrol/slurmctld` - fix comma parsing when updating a
    reservation's nodes.
  * `cgroup/v2` - Avoid capturing log output for ebpf when
    constraining devices, as this can lead to inadvertent failure
    if the log buffer is too small.
  * Fix --gpu-bind=single binding tasks to wrong gpus, leading to
    some gpus having more tasks than they should and other gpus being
    unused.
  * Fix main scheduler loop not starting after failover to backup
    controller.
  * Added error message when attempting to use sattach on batch or
    extern steps.
  * Fix regression in 23.02 that causes slurmstepd to crash when
    `srun` requests more than `TreeWidth` nodes in a step and uses
    the `pmi2` or `pmix` plugin.
  * Reject job `ArrayTaskThrottle` update requests from unprivileged
    users.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.39` - populate description fields of property
    objects in generated OpenAPI specifications where defined.
  * `slurmstepd` - Avoid segfault caused by ContainerPath not being
    terminated by '`/`' in `oci.conf`.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.39` - Change `v0.0.39_job_info` response to tag
    `exit_code` field as being complex instead of only an unsigned
    integer.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Fix %h and %n substitution in `BasePath`
    where `%h` was substituted as the `NodeName` instead of the
    hostname, and `%n` was substituted as an empty string.
  * Fix regression where --cpu-bind=verbose would override
  `TaskPluginParam`.
  * `scancel` - Fix `--clusters`/`-M` for federations. Only filtered
    jobs (e.g. -A, -u, -p, etc.) from the specified clusters will be
    canceled, rather than all jobs in the federation.
    Specific jobids will still be routed to the origin cluster
    for cancellation.

    expired.
  * Fix cgroup null path error on `slurmd/slurmstepd` tear down.

    threads in `slurmctld` while trying to launch various scripts.
    This is additional work for a fix in 23.02.6.
  * Fix memory leak when receiving alias addrs from controller.
  * `scontrol` - Accept `scontrol token lifespan=infinite` to
    create tokens that effectively do not expire.
  * Avoid errors when Slurmdb accounting disabled when `--json` or
    `--yaml` is invoked with CLI commands and `slurmrestd`. Add
    warnings when query would have populated data from Slurmdb
    instead of errors.
  * Fix `slurmctld` memory leak when running job with
    `--tres-per-task=gres:shard:#`
  * Fix backfill trying to start jobs outside of backfill window.
  * Fix oversubscription on partitions with `PreemptMode=OFF`.
  * Preserve node reason on power up if the node is downed
    or drained.

    implemented parser.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Fix how nice values are parsed for job
    submissions.

    controller after a reconfig or restart.
  * Fix deadlock situation in the dbd when adding associations.
  * Update default values of text/blob columns when updating from
    old mysql versions in more situations.  This improves a
    previous fix to handle an uncommon case when upgrading
    mysql/mariadb.
  * Fix rpmbuild in openSUSE/SLES due to incorrect mariadb
    dependency.
  * When upgrading the slurmdbd to 23.11, avoid generating a query
    to update the association table that is larger than
    `max_allowed_packet` which would result in an upgrade failure.
  * Fix rare deadlock when a dynamic node registers at the same
    time that a once per minute background task occurs.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Fix enumerated strings in OpenAPI
    specification not have type field specified.

    restarting with heterogenous jobs that cause jobs to abort on
    restart.
  * Don't allow deletion of non-dynamic nodes.
  * `accounting_storage/mysql` - Fix issue adding partition based
    associations.
  * Respect non-"slurm" settings for `I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP` and
    `HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP` and avoid injecting the `--external-launcher`
    option which will cause `mpirun/mpiexec` to fail with an
    unexpected argument error.
  * Fix bug where scontrol hold would change node count for jobs
    with implicitly defined node counts.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Fix regression of support for "hold"
    in job description.
  * Avoid sending KILL RPCs to unresolvable `POWERING_UP` and
    `POWERED_DOWN` nodes.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.38` - Fix several potential NULL
    dereferences that could cause slurmrestd to crash.
  * Add `--gres-flags=one-task-per-sharing`. Do not allow different
    tasks in to be allocated shared gres from the same sharing gres.
  * Add `SelectTypeParameters=ENFORCE_BINDING_GRES` and
    `ONE_TASK_PER_SHARING_GRES`.
    This gives default behavior for a job's `--gres-flags`.
  * Alter the networking code to try connecting to the backup
    controllers if the DNS lookup for the primary `SlurmctldHost`
    fails.
  * Alter the name resolution to only log at `verbose()` in client
    commands on failures. This allows for HA setups where the DNS
    entries are withdrawn for some `SlurmctldHost` entries without
    flooding the user with errors.
  * Prevent `slurmscriptd` PID leaks when running `slurmctld` in
    foreground mode.
  * Open all `slurmctld` listening ports at startup, and persist
    throughout.
    This also changes the backup `slurmctld` process to open the
    `SlurmctldPort` range, instead of only the first.
  * Fix backup `slurmctld` shutting down instead of resuming
    standby duty if it took control.
  * Fix race condition that delayed the primary `slurmctld`
    resuming when taking control from a backup controller.
  * `srun` - Ensure processed messages are meant for this job in
    case of a rapidly-reused TCP port.

Fri Jan 12 11:08:01 UTC 2024 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Update to 23.11.1 with following major improvements and fixing
  CVE-2023-49933, CVE-2023-49934, CVE-2023-49935, CVE-2023-49936
  and CVE-2023-49937
  * Substantially overhauled the SlurmDBD association management
    code. For clusters updated to 23.11, account and user
    additions or removals are significantly faster than in prior
    releases.
  * Overhauled `scontrol reconfigure` to prevent configuration
    mistakes from disabling slurmctld and slurmd. Instead, an
    error will be returned, and the running configuration will
    persist. This does require updates to the systemd service
    files to use the `--systemd` option to `slurmctld` and `slurmd`.
  * Added a new internal `auth/cred` plugin - `auth/slurm`. This
    builds off the prior `auth/jwt` model, and permits operation
    of the `slurmdbd` and `slurmctld` without access to full
    directory information with a suitable configuration.
  * Added a new `--external-launcher` option to `srun`, which is
    automatically set by common MPI launcher implementations and
    ensures processes using those non-srun launchers have full
    access to all resources allocated on each node.
  * Reworked the dynamic/cloud modes of operation to allow for
    "fanout" - where Slurm communication can be automatically
    offloaded to compute nodes for increased cluster scalability.
  * Overhauled and extended the Reservation subsystem to allow
    for most of the same resource requirements as are placed on
    the job. Notably, this permits reservations to now reserve
    GRES directly.
- Details of changes:
  * Fix `scontrol update job=... TimeLimit+=/-=` when used with a
    raw JobId of job array element.
  * Reject `TimeLimit` increment/decrement when called on job with
    `TimeLimit=UNLIMITED`.
  * Fix issue with requesting a job with `*licenses` as well as
    `*tres-per-task=license`.
  * `slurmctld` - Prevent segfault in `getopt_long()` with an
    invalid long option.
  * slurmrestd - Added `/meta/slurm/cluster` field to responses.
  * Adjust systemd service files to start daemons after
    `remote-fs.target`.
  * Fix `task/cgroup` indexing tasks in cgroup plugins, which
    caused `jobacct/gather` to match the gathered stats with the
    wrong task id.
  * `select/linear` - Fix regression in 23.11 in which jobs that
    requested `*cpus-per-task` were rejected.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Fix the parsing for
    `/slurmdb/v0.0.40/jobs` exit_code query parameter.
  * If a job requests more shards which would allocate more than
    one sharing GRES (gpu) per node refuse it unless
    `SelectTypeparameters` has `MULTIPLE_SHARING_GRES_PJ`.
  * Trigger fatal exit when Slurm API function is called before
    `slurm_init()` is called.
  * `slurmd` - Fix issue with `scontrol reconfigure` when started
    with `-c`.
  * `slurmrestd` - Job submissions that result in the following
    error codes will be considered as successfully submitted (with
    a warning), instead of returning an HTTP 500 error back:
    `ESLURM_NODES_BUSY`, `ESLURM_RESERVATION_BUSY`, `ESLURM_JOB_HELD`,
    `ESLURM_NODE_NOT_AVAIL`, `ESLURM_QOS_THRES`,
    `ESLURM_ACCOUNTING_POLICY`, `ESLURM_RESERVATION_NOT_USABLE`,
    `ESLURM_REQUESTED_PART_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE`,
    `ESLURM_BURST_BUFFER_WAIT`, ESLURM_PARTITION_DOWN`,
    `ESLURM_LICENSES_UNAVAILABLE`.
  * Fix a `slurmctld` fatal error when upgrading to 23.11 and
    changing from `select/cons_res` to `select/cons_tres` at the
    same time.
  * `slurmctld` - Reject arbitrary distribution jobs that have a
    minimum node count that differs from the number of unique
    nodes in the hostlist.
  * Prevent `slurmdbd` errors when updating reservations with names
    containing apostrophes.
  * Prevent message extension attacks that could bypass the
    message hash. CVE-2023-49933.
  * Prevent SQL injection attacks in `slurmdbd`. CVE-2023-49934.
  * Prevent message hash bypass in slurmd which can allow an
    attacker to reuse root-level MUNGE tokens and escalate
    permissions. CVE-2023-49935.
  * Prevent NULL pointer dereference on size_valp overflow.
    CVE-2023-49936.
  * Prevent double-xfree() on error in `_unpack_node_reg_resp()`.
    CVE-2023-49937.
  * For jobs that request  `*cpus-per-gpu`, ensure that the
    `*cpus-per-gpu request` is honored on every node in the and
    not just for the job as a whole.
  * Fix listing available `data_parser` plugins for json and yaml
    when giving no commands to `scontrol` or `sacctmgr`.
  * `slurmctld` - Rework `scontrol reconfigure` to avoid race
    conditions that can result in stray jobs.
  * `slurmctld` - Shave ~1 second off average reconfigure time by
    terminating internal processing threads faster.
  * Skip running `slurmdbd -R` if the connected cluster is 23.11
    or newer. This operation is no longer relevant for 23.11.
  * Ensure `slurmscriptd` shuts down before `slurmctld` is stopped
    or reconfigured.
  * Improve error handling and error messages in `slurmctld` to
    `slurmscriptd` communications. This includes avoiding
    potential deadlock in `slurmctld` if slurmscript dies
    unexpectedly.
  * Do not hold batch jobs whose extra constraints cannot be
    immediately satisfied, and set the state reason to
    `Constraints` instead of `BadConstraints`.
  * Fix verbose log message printing a hex number instead of a job
    id.
  * Upgrade rate limit parameters message from debug to info.
  * For `SchedulerParameters=extra_constraints`, prevent `slurmctld`
    segfault when starting a `slurmd` with `*extra` for a node
    that did not previously set this.
    This also ensures the extra constraints model works off the
    current node state, not the prior state.
  * Fix `*tres-per-task` assertion.
  * Fix a few issues when creating reservations.
  * Add `SchedulerParameters=time_min_as_soft_limit` option.
  * Remove `SLURM_WORKING_CLUSTER` env from batch and srun
    environments.
  * `cli_filter/lua` - return nil for unset time options rather
    than the string `2982616-04:14:00` (which is the internal
    macro `NO_VAL` represented as time string).
  * Remove 'none' plugins for all but auth and cred. scontrol show
    config will report (null) now.
  * Removed `select/cons_res`. Please update your configuration to
    `select/cons_tres`.
  * `mpi/pmix` - When aborted with status 0, avoid marking
    job/step as failed.
  * Fixed typo on `initialized` for the description of
    `ESLURM_PLUGIN_NOT_LOADED`.
  * `cgroup.conf` - Removed deprecated parameters `AllowedKmemSpace`,
    `ConstrainKmemSpace`, `MaxKmemPercent`, and `MinKmemSpace`.
  * `proctrack/cgroup` - Add `SignalChildrenProcesses=<yes|no>`
    option to `cgroup.conf`. This allows signals for cancelling,
    suspending, resuming, etc. to be sent to children processes in
    a `step/job` rather than just the parent.
  * Add `PreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time` parameter to
    control amount of time between `SIGTSTP` and `SIGSTOP` signals
    when suspending jobs.
  * `job_submit/throttle` - improve reset of submitted job counts
    per user in order to better honor
    `SchedulerParameters=jobs_per_user_per_hour=#`.
  * Load the user environment into a private pid namespace to
    avoid user scripts leaving background processes on a node.
  * `scontrol` show `assoc_mgr` will display Lineage instead of Lft
    for associations.
  * Add `SlurmctldParameters=no_quick_restart` to avoid a new
    `slurmctld` taking over the old `slurmctld` by accident.
  * Fix `--cpus-per-gpu` for step allocations, which was
    previously ignored for job steps. `*cpus-per-gpu` implies
    `--exact`.
  * Fix mutual exclusivity of `--cpus-per-gpu` and
    `--cpus-per-task`:  fatal if both options are requested in the
    commandline or both are requested in the environment. If one
    option is requested in the command line, it will override the
    other option in the environment.
  * `slurmrestd` - `openapi/dbv0.0.37` and `openapi/v0.0.37`
    plugins have been removed.
  * `slurmrestd` - `openapi/dbv0.0.38` and `openapi/v0.0.38`
    plugins have been tagged as deprecated.
  * `slurmrestd` - added auto population of `info/version` field.
  * `sdiag` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    data_parser plugin.
  * `sacct` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    `data_parser` plugin.
  * `scontrol` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    `data_parser` plugin.
  * `sinfo` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    `data_parser` plugin.
  * `squeue` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    `data_parser` plugin.
  * Changed the default `SelectType` to `select/cons_tres` (from
    `select/linear`).
  * Allow `SlurmUser`/`root` to use reservations without specific
    permissions.
  * Fix sending step signals to nodes not allocated by the step.
  * Remove `CgroupAutomount=` option from `cgroup.conf`.
  * Add `TopologyRoute=RoutePart` to route communications based
    on partition node lists.
  * Added ability for configless to push Prolog and Epilog
    scripts to `slurmd`s.
  * Prolog and Epilog do not have to be fully qualified pathnames.
  * Changed default value of `PriorityType` from `priority/basic`
    to `priority/multifactor`.
  * `torque/mpiexec` - Propogate exit code from `launched` process.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add new rlimits fields for job submission.
  * Define SPANK options environment variables when
    `--export=[NIL|NONE]` is specified.
  * `slurmrestd` - Numeric input fields provided with a null
    formatted value will now convert to zero (0) where it can be
    a valid value. This is expected to be only be notable with job
    submission against v0.0.38 versioned endpoints with job
    requests with fields provided with null values. These fields
    were already rejected by v0.0.39+ endpoints, unless `+complex`
    parser value is provided to v0.0.40+ endpoints.
  * `slurmrestd` - Improve parsing of integers and floating point
    numbers when handling incoming user provided numeric fields.
    Fields that would have not rejected a number for a numeric
    field followed by other non-numeric characters will now get
    rejected. This is expected to be only be notable with job
    submission against v0.0.38 versioned endpoints with malformed
    job requests.
  * Reject reservation update if it will result in previously
    submitted jobs losing access to the reservation.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - output partition state when dumping
    partitions.
  * Allow for a shared suffix to be used with the hostlist format.
    E.g., `node[0001-0010]-int`.
  * Replace `SRUN_CPUS_PER_TASK` with `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` and
    get back the previous behavior before Slurm 22.05 since now we
    have the new external launcher step.
  * `job_container/tmpfs` - Add `BasePath=none` option to disable
    plugin on node subsets when there is a global setting.
  * Add QOS flag `Relative`. If set the QOS limits will be treated
    as percentages of a cluster/partition instead of absolutes.
  * Remove `FIRST_CORES` flag from reservations.
  * Add cloud instance id and instance type to node records.
    Can be viewed/updated with `scontrol`.
  * `slurmd` - add `instance-id`, `instance-type`, and `extra`
    options to allow them to be set on startup.
  * Add cloud instance accounting to database that can be viewed
    with `sacctmgr show instance`.
  * `select/linear` - fix task launch failure that sometimes
    occurred when requesting  `*threads-per-core` or
    `--hint=nomultithread`. This also fixes memory calculation
    with one of these options and  `*mem-per-cpu`:
    Previously, memory = mem-per-cpu * all cpus including unusable
    threads.
    Now, memory = mem-per-cpu * only usuable threads. This
    behavior matches the documentation and select/cons_tres.
  * `gpu/nvml` - Reduce chances of `NVML_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_SIZE`
    error when getting gpu memory information.
  * `slurmrestd` - Convert to generating `OperationIDs` based on
    path for all v0.0.40 tagged paths.
  * `slurmrestd` - Reduce memory used while dumping a job's stdio
    paths.
  * `slurmrestd` - Jobs queried from `data_parser/v0.0.40` from
    `slurmdb` will have `step/id` field given as a string to match
    CLI formatting instead of an object.
  * `sacct` - Output in JSON or YAML output will will have the
    `step/id` field given as a string instead of an object.
  * `scontrol`/`squeue` - Step output in JSON or YAML output will
    will have the `id` field given as a string instead of an
    object.
  * `slurmrestd` - For `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.40/jobs` mimick default
    behavior for handling of job start and end times as `sacct`
    when one or both fields are not provided as a query parameter.
  * `openapi/slurmctld` - Add `GET /slurm/v0.0.40/shares` endpoint
    to dump same output as `sshare`.
  * `sshare` - add JSON/YAML support.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Remove `required/memory` output in
    json. It is replaced by `required/memory_per_cpu` and
    `required/memory_per_node`.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add numeric id to all association identifiers
    to allow unique identification where association has been
    deleted but is still referenced by accounting record.
  * `slurmrestd` - Add accounting, id, and comment fields to
    association dumps.
  * Use `memory.current` in cgroup/v2 instead of manually
    calculating RSS. This makes accounting consistent with
    OOM Killer.
  * `sreport` - cluster Utilization `PlannedDown` field now
    includes the time that all nodes were in the `POWERED_DOWN`
    state instead of just cloud nodes.
  * `scontrol` update partition now allows `Nodes+=<node-list>` and
    `Nodes-=<node-list>` to add/delete nodes from the existing
    partition node list. `Nodes=+host1,-host2` is also allowed.
  * `sacctmgr` - add `--yaml` and `--json` arg support to specify
    `data_parser` plugin.
  * `sacctmgr` can now modify QOS's RawUsage to zero or a positive
    value.
  * `sdiag` - Added statistics on why the main and backfill
    schedulers have stopped evaluation on each scheduling cycle.
    the number of `RPC limit exceeded...` messages that are logged.
  * Rename `sbcast --fanout` to `--treewidth`.
  * Remove `SLURM_NODE_ALIASES` env variable.
  * Enable fanout for dynamic and unaddresable cloud nodes.
  * Fix how steps are dealloced in an allocation if the last step
    of an srun never completes due to a node failure.
  * Remove redundant database indexes.
  * Add database index to suspend table to speed up archive/purges.
  * When requesting `--tres-per-task` alter incorrect request for
    TRES, it should be `TRESType/TRESName` not `TRESType:TRESName`.
  * Make it so reservations can reserve GRES.
  * `sbcast` - use the specified `--fanout` value on all hops in
    message forwarding; previously the specified fanout was only
    used on the first hop, and additional hops used `TreeWidth` in
    `slurm.conf`.
  * `slurmrestd`- remove logger prefix from `-s/-a list` options
    outputs.
  * `switch/hpe_slingshot` - Add support for collectives.
  * Nodes with suspended jobs can now be displayed as `MIXED`.
  * Fix inconsistent handling of using cli and/or environment
    options for `tres_per_task=cpu:#` and `cpus_per_gpu`.
  * Requesting `--cpus-per-task` will now set
    `SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK=cpu:#` in the  environment.
  * For some tres related environment variables such as
    `SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK`, when `srun` requests a different value
    for that option, set these environment variables to the value
    requested by `srun`. Previously these environment variables
    were unchanged from the job allocation. This bug only affected
    the output environment variables, not the actual step resource
    allocation.
  * `RoutePlugin=route/topology` has been replaced with
    `TopologyParam=RouteTree`.
  * If `ThreadsPerCore` in `slurm.conf` is configured with less
    than the number of hardware threads, fix a bug where the task
    plugins used fewer cores instead of using fewer threads per core.
  * Fix arbitrary distribution allowing it to be used with `salloc`
    and `sbatch` and fix how cpus are allocated to nodes.
  * Allow nodes to reboot while node is drained or in a
    maintenance state.
  * Allow `scontrol` reboot to use nodesets to filter nodes to reboot.
  * Fix how the topology of typed gres gets updated.
  * Changes to the Type option in gres.conf now can be applied with
    `scontrol` reconfig.
  * Allow for jobs that request a newly configured gres type to be
    queued even when the needed `slurmd`s have not yet registered.
  * Kill recovered jobs that require unconfigured gres types.
  * If keepalives are configured, enable them on all persistent
    connections.
  * Configless - Also send Includes from configuration files not
    parsed by the controller (i.e. from `plugstack.conf`).
  * Add `gpu/nrt` plugin for nodes using Trainium/Inferentia
    devices.
  * `data_parser/v0.0.40` - Add `START_RECEIVED` to job flags in
    dumped output.
  * SPANK - Failures from most spank functions (not epilog or
    exit) will now cause the step to be marked as failed and the
    command (`srun`, `salloc`, `sbatch  *wait`) to return 1.

- Fix %do_obsoletes macro expansion to work with SLE-12.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 18:52:44 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Add missing service file for slurmrestd (boo#1217711).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 28 14:14:28 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Explicitly create an Obsoletes: entry for each package version
  that is obsoleted by the present version. These are all published
  versions of the last two major releases as well as all minor
  versions of the present release lower than the current one
  (bsc#1216869 2nd part).
  This prevents the current version to upgrade a old Slurm version
  for which no upgrade path exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 20 15:29:55 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- On SLE-12 exclude build for s390x.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 07:38:00 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Add missing dependencies to slurm-config to plugins package.
  These should help to tie down the slurm version and help to avoid
  a package mix (bsc#1216869).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 12 08:23:20 UTC 2023 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- update to 23.02.6 to fix (CVE-2023-41914, bsc#1216207)
  * Removed Fix-test-32.8.patch as fixed upstream
  * Bug Fixes:
    + Fix `CpusPerTres=` not upgreadable with scontrol update
    + Fix unintentional gres removal when validating the gres job state.
    + Fix `--without-hpe-slingshot` configure option.
    + Fix cgroup v2 memory calculations when transparent huge pages are used.
    + Fix parsing of `sgather --timeout` option.
    + Fix regression from 22.05.0 that caused `srun --cpu-bind "=verbose"`
      and `"=v"` options give different CPU bind masks.
    + Fix "_find_node_record: lookup failure for node" error message appearing
      for all dynamic nodes during reconfigure.
    + Avoid segfault if loading serializer plugin fails.
    + `slurmrestd` - Correct OpenAPI format for `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/licenses`.
    + `slurmrestd` - Correct OpenAPI format for
      `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/job/{job_id}`.
    + `slurmrestd` - Change format to multiple fields in
      `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/assocations` and `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/qos` to
      handle infinite and unset states.
    + When a node fails in a job with `--no-kill`, preserve the extern step on the
      remaining nodes to avoid breaking features that rely on the extern step
      such as `pam_slurm_adopt`, `x11`, and `job_container/tmpfs`.
    + `auth/jwt` - Ignore `x5c` field in JWKS files.
    + `auth/jwt` - Treat 'alg' field as optional in JWKS files.
    + Allow job_desc.selinux_context to be read from the job_submit.lua script.
    + Skip check in slurmstepd that causes a large number of errors in the
      munge log: "Unauthorized credential for client UID=0 GID=0".
      This error will still appear on `slurmd`/`slurmctld`/`slurmdbd` start up
      and is not a cause for concern.
    + `slurmctld` - Allow startup with zero partitions.
    + Fix some mig profile names in slurm not matching nvidia mig profiles.
    + Prevent `slurmscriptd` processing delays from blocking other threads in
      `slurmctld` while trying to launch `{Prolog|Epilog}Slurmctld`.
    + Fix sacct printing ReqMem field when memory doesn't exist in requested
      TRES.
    + Fix how heterogenous steps in an allocation with `CR_PACK_NODE` or
      `-mpack` are created.
    + Fix `slurmctld` crash from race condition within `job_submit_throttle`
      plugin.
    + Fix `--with-systemdsystemunitdir` when requesting a default location.
    + Fix not being able to cancel an array task by the jobid (i.e. not
      `<jobid>_<taskid>`) through scancel, job launch failure or prolog
      failure.
    + Fix cancelling the whole array job when the array task is the meta job
      and it fails job or prolog launch and is not requeable. Cancel only the
      specific task instead.
    + Fix regression in 21.08.2 where MailProg did not run for `mail-type=end`
      for jobs with non+zero exit codes.
    + Fix incorrect setting of memory.swap.max in cgroup/v2.
    + Fix `jobacctgather/cgroup` collection of disk/io, gpumem, gpuutil TRES
      values.
    + Fix -d singleton for heterogeneous jobs.
    + Downgrade info logs about a job meeting a "maximum node limit" in the
      select plugin to `DebugFlags=SelectType`. These info logs could spam the
      slurmctld log file under certain circumstances.
    + `prep/script` - Fix `[Srun|Task]<Prolog|Epilog>` missing
      `SLURM_JOB_NODELIST`.
    + gres - Rebuild GRES core bitmap for nodes at startup. This fixes error:
      "Core bitmaps size mismatch on node [HOSTNAME]", which causes jobs to
      enter state "Requested node configuration is not available".
    + `slurmctd` - Allow startup with zero nodes.
    + Fix filesystem handling race conditions that could lead to an attacker
      taking control of an arbitrary file, or removing entire directories'
      contents. CVE-2023-41914.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 18 05:23:19 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Updated to version 23.02.5 with the following changes:
  * Bug Fixes:
    + Revert a change in 23.02 where `SLURM_NTASKS` was no longer set in the
      job's environment when `--ntasks-per-node` was requested.
      The method that is is being set, however, is different and should be more
      accurate in more situations.
    + Change pmi2 plugin to honor the `SrunPortRange` option. This matches the
      new behavior of the pmix plugin in 23.02.0. Note that neither of these
      plugins makes use of the `MpiParams=ports=` option, and previously
      were only limited by the systems ephemeral port range.
    + Fix regression in 23.02.2 that caused slurmctld -R to crash on startup if
      a node features plugin is configured.
    + Fix and prevent reoccurring reservations from overlapping.
    + `job_container/tmpfs` - Avoid attempts to share BasePath between nodes.
    + With `CR_Cpu_Memory`, fix node selection for jobs that request gres and
      `--mem-per-cpu`.
    + Fix a regression from 22.05.7 in which some jobs were allocated too few
      nodes, thus overcommitting cpus to some tasks.
    + Fix a job being stuck in the completing state if the job ends while the
      primary controller is down or unresponsive and the backup controller has
      not yet taken over.
    + Fix `slurmctld` segfault when a node registers with a configured
      `CpuSpecList` while `slurmctld` configuration has the node without
      `CpuSpecList`.
    + Fix cloud nodes getting stuck in `POWERED_DOWN+NO_RESPOND` state after
      not registering by `ResumeTimeout`.
    + `slurmstepd` - Avoid cleanup of `config.json-less` containers spooldir
      getting skipped.
    + Fix scontrol segfault when 'completing' command requested repeatedly in
      interactive mode.
    + Properly handle a race condition between `bind()` and `listen()` calls
      in the network stack when running with SrunPortRange set.
    + Federation - Fix revoked jobs being returned regardless of the
      `-a`/`--all` option for privileged users.
    + Federation - Fix canceling pending federated jobs from non-origin
      clusters which could leave federated jobs orphaned from the origin
      cluster.
    + Fix sinfo segfault when printing multiple clusters with `--noheader`
      option.
    + Federation - fix clusters not syncing if clusters are added to a
      federation before they have registered with the dbd.
    + `node_features/helpers` - Fix node selection for jobs requesting
      changeable.
      features with the `|` operator, which could prevent jobs from
      running on some valid nodes.
    + `node_features/helpers` - Fix inconsistent handling of `&` and `|`,
      where an AND'd feature was sometimes AND'd to all sets of features
      instead of just the current set. E.g. `foo|bar&baz` was interpreted
      as `{foo,baz}` or `{bar,baz}` instead of how it is documented:
      `{foo} or {bar,baz}`.
    + Fix job accounting so that when a job is requeued its allocated node
      count is cleared. After the requeue, sacct will correctly show that
      the job has 0 `AllocNodes` while it is pending or if it is canceled
      before restarting.
    + `sacct` - `AllocCPUS` now correctly shows 0 if a job has not yet
      received an allocation or if the job was canceled before getting one.
    + Fix intel OneAPI autodetect: detect the `/dev/dri/renderD[0-9]+` GPUs,
      and do not detect `/dev/dri/card[0-9]+`.
    + Fix node selection for jobs that request `--gpus` and a number of
      tasks fewer than GPUs, which resulted in incorrectly rejecting these
      jobs.
    + Remove `MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT` completely.
    + Fix cloud nodes in `POWERING_UP` state disappearing (getting set
      to `FUTURE`)
      when an `scontrol reconfigure` happens.
    + `openapi/dbv0.0.39` - Avoid assert / segfault on missing coordinators
      list.
    + `slurmrestd` - Correct memory leak while parsing OpenAPI specification
      templates with server overrides.
    + Fix overwriting user node reason with system message.
    + Prevent deadlock when `rpc_queue` is enabled.
    + `slurmrestd` - Correct OpenAPI specification generation bug where
      fields with overlapping parent paths would not get generated.
    + Fix memory leak as a result of a partition info query.
    + Fix memory leak as a result of a job info query.
    + For step allocations, fix `--gres=none` sometimes not ignoring gres
      from the job.
    + Fix `--exclusive` jobs incorrectly gang-scheduling where they shouldn't.
    + Fix allocations with `CR_SOCKET`, gres not assigned to a specific
      socket, and block core distribion potentially allocating more sockets
      than required.
    + Revert a change in 23.02.3 where Slurm would kill a script's process
      group as soon as the script ended instead of waiting as long as any
      process in that process group held the stdout/stderr file descriptors
      open. That change broke some scripts that relied on the previous
      behavior. Setting time limits for scripts (such as
      `PrologEpilogTimeout`) is strongly encouraged to avoid Slurm waiting
      indefinitely for scripts to finish.
    + Fix `slurmdbd -R` not returning an error under certain conditions.
    + `slurmdbd` - Avoid potential NULL pointer dereference in the mysql
      plugin.
    + Fix regression in 23.02.3 which broken X11 forwarding for hosts when
      MUNGE sends a localhost address in the encode host field. This is caused
      when the node hostname is mapped to 127.0.0.1 (or similar) in
      `/etc/hosts`.
    + `openapi/[db]v0.0.39` - fix memory leak on parsing error.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - fix updating qos for associations.
    + `openapi/dbv0.0.39` - fix updating values for associations with null
      users.
    + Fix minor memory leak with `--tres-per-task` and licenses.
    + Fix cyclic socket cpu distribution for tasks in a step where
      `--cpus-per-task` < usable threads per core.
    + `slurmrestd` - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/node[s]`, change format of
      node's energy field `current_watts` to a dictionary to account for
      unset value instead of dumping 4294967294.
    + `slurmrestd` - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/qos`, change format of QOS's
      field "priority" to a dictionary to account for unset value instead of
      dumping 4294967294.
    + slurmrestd - For `GET /slurm/v0.0.39/job[s]`, the 'return code'
      code field in `v0.0.39_job_exit`_code will be set to -127 instead of
      being left unset where job does not have a relevant return code.
  * Other Changes:
    + Remove --uid / --gid options from salloc and srun commands. These options
      did not work correctly since the CVE-2022-29500 fix in combination with
      some changes made in 23.02.0.
    + Add the `JobId` to `debug()` messages indicating when
      `cpus_per_task/mem_per_cpu` or `pn_min_cpus` are being automatically
      adjusted.
    + Change the log message warning for rate limited users from verbose to
      info.
    + `slurmstepd` - Cleanup per task generated environment for containers in
      spooldir.
    + Format batch, extern, interactive, and pending step ids into strings that
      are human readable.
    + `slurmrestd` - Reduce memory usage when printing out job CPU frequency.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - Add `required/memory_per_cpu` and
      `required/memory_per_node` to `sacct --json` and `sacct --yaml` and
      `GET /slurmdb/v0.0.39/jobs` from slurmrestd.
    + `gpu/oneapi` - Store cores correctly so CPU affinity is tracked.
    + Allow `slurmdbd -R` to work if the root assoc id is not 1.
    + Limit periodic node registrations to 50 instead of the full `TreeWidth`.
      Since unresolvable `cloud/dynamic` nodes must disable fanout by setting
      `TreeWidth` to a large number, this would cause all nodes to register at
      once.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 09:43:08 UTC 2023 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Updated to 23.02.4 with the following changes:
  * Bug Fixes:
    + Fix main scheduler loop not starting after a failover to backup
      controller. Avoid slurmctld segfault when specifying
     `AccountingStorageExternalHost` (bsc#1214983).
    + Fix sbatch return code when `--wait` is requested on a job array.
    + Fix collected `GPUUtilization` values for `acct_gather_profile` plugins.
    + Fix `slurmrestd` handling of job hold/release operations.
    + Fix step running indefinitely when slurmctld takes more than
      `MessageTimeout` to respond. Now, `slurmctld` will cancel the step when
       detected, preventing following steps from getting stuck waiting for
       resources to be released.
    + Fix regression to make `job_desc.min_cpus` accurate again in `job_submit`
      when requesting a job with `--ntasks-per-node`.
    + Fix handling of `ArrayTaskThrottle` in backfill.
    + Fix regression in 23.02.2 when checking gres state on `slurmctld`
      startup  or reconfigure. Gres changes in the configuration were not
      updated on slurmctld startup. On startup or reconfigure, these messages
      were present in the log: `error: Attempt to change gres/gpu Count`.
    + Fix potential double count of gres when dealing with limits.
    + Fix `slurmstepd` segfault when `ContainerPath` is not set in `oci.conf`
    + Fixed an issue where jobs requesting licenses were incorrectly rejected.
    + `scrontab` - Fix cutting off the final character of quoted variables.
    + `smail` - Fix issues where e-mails at job completion were not being sent.
    + `scontrol/slurmctld` - fix comma parsing when updating a reservation's
       nodes.
    + Fix `--gpu-bind=single binding` tasks to wrong gpus, leading to some gpus
      having more tasks than they should and other gpus being unused.
    + Fix regression in 23.02 that causes slurmstepd to crash when `srun`
      requests more than `TreeWidth` nodes in a step and uses the pmi2 or
      pmix plugin.
    + `job_container/tmpfs` - Fix `%h` and `%n` substitution in `BasePath`
      where `%h` was substituted as the NodeName instead of the hostname,
      and %n was substituted as an empty string.
    + Fix regression where `--cpu-bind=verbose` would override
      `TaskPluginParam`.
    + `scancel` - Fix `--clusters/-M` for federations. Only filtered jobs
      (e.g. `-A`, `-u`, `-p`, etc.) from the specified clusters will be
      canceled, rather than all jobs in the federation. Specific jobids
      will still be routed to the origin cluster for cancellation.
  * Other changes:
    + Make spank `S_JOB_ARGV` item value hold the requested command `argv`
      instead of the `srun --bcast` value when `--bcast` requested (only in
      local context).
    + `scontrol` - Permit changes to StdErr and StdIn for pending jobs.
    + `scontrol` - Reset `std`{`err`,`in`,`out`} when set to empty string.
    + `slurmrestd` - mark environment as a required field for job submission
      descriptions.
    + `slurmrestd` - avoid dumping null in OpenAPI schema required fields.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - avoid rejecting valid `memory_per_node` formatted
      as dictionary provided with a job description.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - avoid rejecting valid `memory_per_cpu` formatted
       as dictionary provided with a job description.
    + `slurmrestd` - Return HTTP error code 404 when job query fails.
    + `slurmrestd` - Add return schema to error response to job and license
      query.
    + Change the log message warning for rate limited users from debug to
      verbose.
    + `cgroup/v2` - Avoid capturing log output for ebpf when constraining
      devices,
      as this can lead to inadvertent failure if the log buffer is too small.
    + Added error message when attempting to use sattach on batch or extern
      steps.
    + Reject job `ArrayTaskThrottle` update requests from unprivileged users.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - populate description fields of property objects
      in generated OpenAPI specifications where defined.
    + `slurmstepd` - Avoid segfault caused by `ContainerPath` not being
      terminated by `/` in `oci.conf`.
    + `data_parser/v0.0.39` - Change `v0.0.39_job_info` response to tag
      `exit_code` field as being complex instead of only an unsigned integer.
- Updated to 23.02.3 with the following changes:
  * Bug Fixes:
    + `slurmctld` - Fix backup slurmctld crash when it takes control
      multiple times.
    + Fix regression in 23.02.2 that ignored the partition `DefCpuPerGPU`
      setting on the first pass of scheduling a job requesting
      `--gpus --ntasks`.
    + `srun` - fix issue creating regular and interactive steps because
       environment variables were incorrectly set on non-HetSteps.
    + Fix dynamic nodes getting stuck in allocated states when reconfiguring.
    + Fix regression in 23.02.2 that set the `SLURM_NTASKS` environment
      variable in sbatch jobs from `--ntasks-per-node` when `--ntasks` was not
      requested.
    + Fix regression in 23.02 that caused sbatch jobs to set the wrong number
      of tasks when requesting `--ntasks-per-node` without `--ntasks`, and also
      requesting one of the following options: `--sockets-per-node`,
      `--cores-per-socket`, `--threads-per-core` (or `--hint=nomultithread`),
      or `-B,--extra-node-info`.
    + Fix double counting suspended job counts on nodes when reconfiguring,
      which prevented nodes with suspended jobs from being powered down or
      rebooted once the jobs completed.
    + Fix backfill not scheduling jobs submitted with `--prefer` and
      `--constraint` properly.
    + mpi/pmix - fix regression introduced in 23.02.2 which caused PMIx shmem
      backed files permissions to be incorrect.
    + api/submit - fix memory leaks when submission of batch regular jobs
      or batch HetJobs fails (response data is a return code).
    + Fix regression in 23.02 leading to error() messages being sent at `INFO`
      instead of `ERR` in syslog.
    + Fix `TresUsageIn[Tot|Ave]` calculation for `gres/gpumem` and
      `gres/gpuutil`.
    + Fix issue in the gpu plugins where gpu frequencies would only be set if
      both gpu memory and gpu frequencies were set, while one or the other
      suffices.
    + Fix reservations group ACL's not working with the root group.
    + Fix updating a job with a ReqNodeList greater than the job's node count.
    + Fix inadvertent permission denied error for `--task-prolog` and
      `--task-epilog` with filesystems mounted with `root_squash`.
    + Fix missing detailed cpu and gres information in json/yaml output from
      `scontrol`, `squeue` and `sinfo`.
    + Fix regression in 23.02 that causes a failure to allocate job steps that
      request `--cpus-per-gpu` and gpus with types.
    + Fix potentially waiting indefinitely for a defunct process to finish,
      which affects various scripts including `Prolog` and `Epilog`. This could
      have various symptoms, such as jobs getting stuck in a completing state.
    + Fix losing list of reservations on job when updating job with list of
      reservations and restarting the controller.
    + Fix nodes resuming after down and drain state update requests from
      clients older than 23.02.
    + Fix advanced reservation creation/update when an association that should
      have access to it is composed with partition(s).
    + Fix job layout calculations with `--ntasks-per-gpu`, especially when
      `--nodes` has not been explicitly provided.
    + Fix X11 forwarding for jobs submitted from the slurmctld host.
    +  When a job requests `--no-kill` and one or more nodes fail during the
       job, fix subsequent job steps unable to use some of the remaining
       resources allocated to the job.
    + Fix shared gres allocation when using `--tres-per-task` with tasks that
      span multiple sockets.
    + `auth/jwt` - Fix memory leak.
  * Other changes:
    + `openapi/dbv0.0.39/users` - If a default account update failed, resulting
      in a no-op, the query returned success without any warning. Now a warning
      is sent back to the client that the default account wasn't modified.
    + Avoid job write lock when nodes are dynamically added/removed.
    + `burst_buffer/lua` - allow jobs to get scheduled sooner after
      `slurm_bb_data_in` completes.
    + `openapi/v0.0.39` - fix memory leak in `_job_post_het_submit()`.
    + Avoid possible `slurmctld` segfault caused by race condition with already
      completed `slurmdbd_conn` connections.
    + `Slurmdbd.conf` checks included conf files for 0600 permissions
    + `slurmrestd` - fix regression "oversubscribe" fields were removed from
      job descriptions and submissions from v0.0.39 end points.
    + `accounting_storage/mysql` - Query for indiviual QOS correctly when you
      have more than 10.
    + Add warning message about ignoring `--tres-per-tasks=license` when used
      on a step.
    + `sshare` - Fix command to work when using `priority/basic`.
    + Avoid loading `cli_filter` plugins outside of `salloc`/`sbatch`/`scron`/
      `srun`. This fixes a number of missing symbol problems that can manifest
      for executables linked against libslurm (and not `libslurmfull`).
    + Allow cloud_reg_addrs to update dynamically registered node's addrs on
      subsequent registrations.
    + Revert a change in 22.05.5 that prevented tasks from sharing a core if
      `--cpus-per-task` > threads per core, but caused incorrect accounting and
      cpu binding. Instead, `--ntasks-per-core=1` may be requested to prevent
      tasks from sharing a core.
    + Correctly send `assoc_mgr` lock to mcs plugin.
    + Avoid unnecessary `gres/gpumem` and `gres/gpuutil` `TRES` position
      lookups.
    + `sacct` - when printing `PLANNED` time, use end time instead of start
      time for jobs cancelled before they started.
    + Hold the job with `(Reservation ... invalid)` state reason if the
      reservation is not usable by the job.
    + `sbatch` - Added new `--export=NIL` option.

Mon Feb 20 20:45:59 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- updated to 23.02.0
  * Highlights
    + slurmctld - Add new RPC rate limiting feature. This is enabled through
      SlurmctldParameters=rl_enable, otherwise disabled by default.
    + Make scontrol reconfigure and sending a SIGHUP to the slurmctld behave
      the same. If you were using SIGHUP as a 'lighter' scontrol reconfigure
      to rotate logs please update your scripts to use SIGUSR2 instead.
    + Change cloud nodes to show by default. PrivateData=cloud is no longer
      needed.
    + sreport - Count planned (FKA reserved) time for jobs running in
      IGNORE_JOBS reservations. Previously was lumped into IDLE time.
    + job_container/tmpfs - Support running with an arbitrary list of private
      mount points (/tmp and /dev/shm are the default, but not required).
    + job_container/tmpfs - Set more environment variables in InitScript.
    + Make all cgroup directories created by Slurm owned by root. This was the
      behavior in cgroup/v2 but not in cgroup/v1 where by default the step
      directories ownership were set to the user and group of the job.
    + accounting_storage/mysql - change purge/archive to calculate record ages
      based on end time, rather than start or submission times.
    + job_submit/lua - add support for log_user() from slurm_job_modify().
    + Run the following scripts in slurmscriptd instead of slurmctld:
      ResumeProgram, ResumeFailProgram, SuspendProgram, ResvProlog, ResvEpilog,
      and RebootProgram (only with SlurmctldParameters=reboot_from_controller).
    + Only permit changing log levels with 'srun --slurmd-debug' by root
      or SlurmUser.
    + slurmctld will fatal() when reconfiguring the job_submit plugin fails.
    + Add PowerDownOnIdle partition option to power down nodes after nodes
      become idle.
    + Add "[jobid.stepid]" prefix from slurmstepd and "slurmscriptd" prefix
      from slurmcriptd to Syslog logging. Previously was only happening when
      logging to a file.
    + Add purge and archive functionality for job environment and job batch
      script records.
    + Extend support for Include files to all "configless" client commands.
    + Make node weight usable for powered down and rebooting nodes.
    + Removed 'launch' plugin.
    + Add "Extra" field to job to store extra information other than a comment.
    + Add usage gathering for AMD (requires ROCM 5.5+) and NVIDIA gpus.
    + Add job's allocated nodes, features, oversubscribe, partition, and
      reservation to SLURM_RESUME_FILE output for power saving.
    + Automatically create directories for stdout/stderr output files. Paths
      may use %j and related substitution characters as well.
    + Add --tres-per-task to salloc/sbatch/srun.
    + Allow nodefeatures plugin features to work with cloud nodes.
      e.g. - Powered down nodes have no active changeable features.
      	   - Nodes can't be changed to other active features until powered down.
	   - Active changeable features are reset/cleared on power down.
    + Make slurmstepd cgroups constrained by total configured memory from
      slurm.conf (NodeName=<> RealMemory=#) instead of total physical memory.
    + node_features/helpers - add support for the OR and parentheses operators
      in a --constraint expression.
    + slurmctld will fatal() when [Prolog|Epilog]Slurmctld are defined but
      are not executable.
    + Validate node registered active features are a super set of node's
      currently active changeable features.
    + On clusters without any PrologFlags options, batch jobs with failed
      prologs no longer generate an output file.
    + Add SLURM_JOB_START_TIME and SLURM_JOB_END_TIME environment variables.
    + Add SuspendExcStates option to slurm.conf to avoid suspending/powering
      down specific node states.
    + Add support for DCMI power readings in IPMI plugin.
    + slurmrestd served /slurm/v0.0.39 and /slurmdb/v0.0.39 endpoints had major
      changes from prior versions. Almost all schemas have been renamed and
      modified. Sites using OpenAPI Generator clients are highly suggested to
      upgrade to to using atleast version 6.x due to limitations with prior
      versions.
    + Allow for --nodelist to contain more nodes than required by --nodes.
    + Rename "nodes" to "nodes_resume" in SLURM_RESUME_FILE job output.
    + Rename "all_nodes" to "all_nodes_resume" in SLURM_RESUME_FILE output.
    + Add jobcomp/kafka plugin.
    + Add new PreemptParameters=reclaim_licenses option which will allow higher
      priority jobs to preempt jobs to free up used licenses. (This is only
      enabled for with PreemptModes of CANCEL and REQUEUE, as Slurm cannot
      guarantee suspended jobs will release licenses correctly.)
    + hpe/slingshot - add support for the instant-on feature.
    + Add ability to update SuspendExc* parameters with scontrol.
    + Add ability to restore SuspendExc* parameters on restart with slurmctld
      -R option.
    + Add ability to clear a GRES specification by setting it to "0" via
    'scontrol update job'.
    + Add SLURM_JOB_OVERSUBSCRIBE environment variable for Epilog, Prolog,
      EpilogSlurmctld, PrologSlurmctld, and mail ouput.
    + System node down reasons are appended to existing reasons, separated
      by ':'.
    + New command scrun has been added. scrun acts as an Open Container
      Initiative (OCI) runtime proxy to run containers seamlessly via Slurm.
    + Fixed GpuFreqDef option. When set in slurm.conf, it will be used if
      --gpu-freq was not explicitly set by the job step.
  * Configuration Changes
    + job_container.conf - Added "Dirs" option to list desired private mount
      points.
    + node_features plugins - invalid users specified for AllowUserBoot will
      now result in fatal() rather than just an error.
    + Deprecate AllowedKmemSpace, ConstrainKmemSpace, MaxKmemPercent, and
      MinKmemSpace.
    + Allow jobs to queue even if the user is not in AllowGroups when
      EnforcePartLimits=no is set. This ensures consistency for all the
      Partition access controls, and matches the documented behavior for
      EnforcePartLimits.
    + Add InfluxDBTimeout parameter to acct_gather.conf.
    + job_container/tmpfs - add support for expanding %h and %n in BasePath.
    + slurm.conf - Removed SlurmctldPlugstack option.
    + Add new SlurmctldParameters=validate_nodeaddr_threads=<number> option to
      allow concurrent hostname resolution at slurmctld startup.
    + Add new AccountingStoreFlags=job_extra option to store a job's extra field
      in the database.
    + Add new "defer_batch" option to SchedulerParameters to only defer
      scheduling for batch jobs.
    + Add new DebugFlags option 'JobComp' to replace 'Elasticsearch'.
    + Add configurable job requeue limit parameter - MaxBatchRequeue - in
    slurm.conf to permit changes from the old hard-coded value of 5.
    + helpers.conf - Allow specification of node specific features.
    + helpers.conf - Allow many features to one helper script.
    + job_container/tmpfs - Add "Shared" option to support shared namespaces.
      This allows autofs to work with the job_container/tmpfs plugin when
      enabled.
    + acct_gather.conf - Added EnergyIPMIPowerSensors=Node=DCMI and
      Node=DCMI_ENHANCED.
    + Add new "getnameinfo_cache_timeout=<number>" option to
      CommunicationParameters to adjust or disable caching the results of
      getnameinfo().
    + Add new PrologFlags=ForceRequeueOnFail option to automatically requeue
      batch jobs on Prolog failures regardless of the job --requeue setting.
    + Add HealthCheckNodeState=NONDRAINED_IDLE option.
    + Add 'explicit' to Flags in gres.conf. This makes it so the gres is not
      automatically added to a job's allocation when --exclusive is used. Note
      that this is a per-node flag.
    + Moved the "preempt_" options from SchedulerParameters to
      PreemptParameters, and dropped the prefix from the option names.
      (The old options will still be parsed for backwards compatibility,
      but are now undocumented.)
    + Add LaunchParameters=ulimit_pam_adopt, which enables setting RLIMIT_RSS
      in adopted processes.
    + Update SwitchParameters=job_vni to enable/disable creating job VNIs
      for all jobs, or when a user requests them.
    + Update SwitchParameters=single_node_vni to enable/disable creating
      single node vnis for all jobs, or when a user requests them.
    + Add ability to preserve SuspendExc* parameters on reconfig with
      ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings.
    + slurmdbd.conf - Add new AllResourcesAbsolute to force all new resources
      to be created with the Absolute flag.
    + topology/tree - Add new TopologyParam=SwitchAsNodeRank option to reorder
      nodes based on switch layout. This can be useful if the naming convention
      for the nodes does not natually map to the network topology.
    + Removed the default setting for GpuFreqDef. If unset, no attempt to change
      the GPU frequency will be made if --gpu-freq is not set for the step.
  * Command Changes
    + sacctmgr - no longer force updates to the AdminComment, Comment, or
      SystemComment to lower-case.
    + sinfo - Add -F/--future option to sinfo to display future nodes.
    + sacct - Rename 'Reserved' field to 'Planned' to match sreport and the
      nomenclature of the 'Planned' node.
    + scontrol - advanced reservation flag MAINT will no longer replace nodes,
      similar to STATIC_ALLOC
    + sbatch - add parsing for #PBS -d and #PBS -w.
    + scontrol show assoc_mgr will show username(uid) instead of uid in
      QoS section.
    + Add strigger --draining and -R/--resume options.
    + Change --oversubscribe and --exclusive to be mutually exclusive for
      job submission. Job submission commands will now fatal if both are set.
      Previously, these options would override each other, with the last one
      in the job submission command taking effect.
    + scontrol - Requested TRES and allocated TRES will now always be printed
      when showing jobs, instead of one TRES output that was either the
      requested or allocated.
    + srun --ntasks-per-core now applies to job and step allocations. Now,
      use of --ntasks-per-core=1 implies --cpu-bind=cores and
      --ntasks-per-core>1 implies --cpu-bind=threads.
    + salloc/sbatch/srun - Check and abort if ntasks-per-core >
      threads-per-core.
    + scontrol - Add ResumeAfter=<secs> option to "scontrol update nodename=".
    + Add a new "nodes=" argument to scontrol setdebug to allow the debug
      level on the slurmd processes to be temporarily altered.
    + Add a new "nodes=" argument to "scontrol setdebugflags" as well.
    + Make it so scrontab prints client-side the job_submit() err_msg (which
      can be set i.e. by using the log_user() function for the lua plugin).
    + scontrol - Reservations will not be allowed to have STATIC_ALLOC or
      MAINT flags and REPLACE[_DOWN] flags simultaneously.
    + scontrol - Reservations will only accept one reoccurring flag when
      being created or updated.
    + scontrol - A reservation cannot be updated to be reoccurring if it is
      already a floating reservation.
    + squeue - removed unused '%s' and 'SelectJobInfo' formats.
    + squeue - align print format for exit and derived codes with that of
      other components (<exit_status>:<signal_number>).
    + sacct - Add --array option to expand job arrays and display array
      tasks on separate lines.
    + Partial support for '--json' and '--yaml' formated outputs have been
      implemented for sacctmgr, sdiag, sinfo, squeue, and scontrol. The
      resultant data ouput will be filtered by normal command arguments.
      Formatting arguments will continue to be ignored.
    + salloc/sbatch/srun - extended the --nodes syntax to allow for a list
      of valid node counts to be allocated to the job. This also supports
      a "step count" value (e.g., --nodes=20-100:20 is equivalent to
      --nodes=20,40,60,80,100) which can simplify the syntax when the job
      needs to scale by a certain "chunk" size.
    + srun - add user requestible vnis with '--network=job_vni' option.
    + srun - add user requestible single node vnis with the
      '--network=single_node_vni' option.
  * API Changes
    + job_container plugins - container_p_stepd_create() function signature
      replaced uint32_t uid with stepd_step_rec_t* step.
    + gres plugins - gres_g_get_devices() function signature replaced pid_t
      pid with stepd_step_rec_t* step.
    + cgroup plugins - task_cgroup_devices_constrain() function signature
      removed pid_t pid.
    + task plugins - replace task_p_pre_set_affinity(), task_p_set_affinity(),
      and task_p_post_set_affinity() with task_p_pre_launch_priv() like it
      was back in slurm 20.11.
    + Allow for concurrent processing of job_submit_g_submit() and
      job_submit_g_modify() calls. If your plugin is not capable of concurrent
      operation you must add additional locking within your plugin.
    + Removed return value from slurm_list_append().
    + The List and ListIterator types have been removed in favor of list_t
      and list_itr_t respectively.
    + burst buffer plugins - add bb_g_build_het_job_script().
      bb_g_get_status() - added authenticated UID and GID.
      bb_g_run_script() - added job_info argument.
    + burst_buffer.lua - Pass UID and GID to most hooks. Pass job_info
      (detailed job information) to many hooks. See
      etc/burst_buffer.lua.example for a complete list of changes.
      WARNING: Backwards compatibility is broken for
      slurm_bb_get_status: UID and GID are passed before the variadic
      arguments. If UID and GID are not explicitly listed as arguments to
      slurm_bb_get_status(), then they will be included in the variadic
      arguments.
      Backwards compatibility is maintained for all other hooks because
      the new arguments are passed after the existing arguments.

- testsuite: on later SUSE versions claim ownership of directory
  /etc/security/limits.d.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 16:39:45 UTC 2022 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Move the ext_sensors/rrd plugin to a separate package: this
  plugin requires librrd which in turn requires huge parts of
  the client side X Window System stack.
  There is probably no use in cluttering up a system for a
  plugin that probably only used by a few.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 21 15:14:30 UTC 2022 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Test Suite fixes:
  * Update README_Testsuite.md.
  * Clean up left over files when de-installing test suite.
  * Adjustment to test suite package: for SLE mark the openmpi4
    devel package and slurm-hdf5 optional.
  * Add -ffat-lto-objects to the build flags when LTO is set to
    make sure the object files we ship with the test suite still
    work correctly (boo#1204697).
  * Improve setup-testsuite.sh: copy ssh fingerprints from all nodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 14 08:49:24 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 22.05.5
- NOTE: Slurm validates that libraries are of the same version. Unfortunately,
  due to an oversight, we failed to notice that the slurmstepd loads the
  hash_k12 library only after a job has completed. This means that if the
  hash_k12 library is upgraded before a job finishes, the slurmstepd will load
  the new library when the job finishes, and will fail due to a mismatch of
  versions.  This results in nodes with slurmstepd processes stuck
  indefinitely. These processes require manual intervention to clean up. There
  is no clean way to resolve these hung slurmstepd processes.
  The only recommended way to upgrade between minor versions of 22.05 with
  RPM’s or upgrades that replace current binaries and libraries is to drain the
  nodes of running jobs first.
- Fixes a number of moderate severity issues, noteable are:
  * Load hash plugin at slurmstepd launch time to prevent issues loading the
    plugin at step completion if the Slurm installation is upgraded.
  * Update nvml plugin to match the unique id format for MIG devices in new
    Nvidia drivers.
  * Fix multi-node step launch failure when nodes in the controller aren't in
    natural order. This can happen with inconsistent node naming (such as
    node15 and node052) or with dynamic nodes which can register in any order.
  * job_container/tmpfs - cleanup containers even when the .ns file isn't
    mounted anymore.
  * Wait up to PrologEpilogTimeout before shutting down slurmd to allow prolog
    and epilog scripts to complete or timeout. Previously, slurmd waited 120
    seconds before timing out and killing prolog and epilog scripts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 24 07:34:31 UTC 2022 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Do not deduplicate files of testsuite Slurm configuration.
  This directory is supposed to be mounted over /etc/slurm
  therefore it must not contain softlinks to the files in
  this directory.
- Improve .a and .o file collection for test suite: find these
  files even if there are multiple ones in a single line.

  NOTE: This package is not meant to be used for testing by the
  user but rather for testing by the maintainers to ensure the
  package is working properly.
  DO NOT report test suite failures unless you are able to confirm
  that the failure is really a bug.
  * Fixes for test suite:
    Keep-logs-of-skipped-test-when-running-test-cases-sequentially.patch
    Fix-test-21.41.patch
    Fix-test-38.11.patch

Wed Nov 17 08:33:13 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 21.08.4 which fixes (CVE-2021-43337) which is only present
  in 21.08 tree.
  * CVE-2021-43337:
    For sites using the new AccountingStoreFlags=job_script and/or job_env
    options, an issue was reported with the access control rules in SlurmDBD
    that will permit users to request job scripts and environment files that
    they should not have access to. (Scripts/environments are meant to only be
    accessible by user accounts with administrator privileges, by account
    coordinators for jobs submitted under their account, and by the user
    themselves.)
- changes from 21.08.3:
  * This includes a number of fixes since the last release a month ago,
    including one critical fix to prevent a communication issue between
    slurmctld and slurmdbd for sites that have started using the new
    AccountingStoreFlags=job_script functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 29 15:54:53 UTC 2021 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- update to 21.08.2 
- major change:
  * removed of support of the TaskAffinity=yes option in cgroup.conf. Please
    consider using "TaskPlugins=cgroup,affinity" in slurm.conf as an option.
- minor changes and bugfixes:
  * slurmctld - fix how the max number of cores on a node in a partition are
    calculated when the partition contains multi*socket nodes. This in turn
    corrects certain jobs node count estimations displayed client*side.
  * job_submit/cray_aries - fix "craynetwork" GRES specification after changes
    introduced in 21.08.0rc1 that made TRES always have a type prefix.

  * accounting_storage/mysql - fix issue where querying jobs via sacct
    *-whole-hetjob=yes or slurmrestd (which automatically includes this flag)
    could in some cases return more records than expected.
  * Fix issue for preemption of job array task that makes afterok dependency
    fail. Additionally, send emails when requeueing happens due to preemption.
  * Fix sending requeue mail type.
  * Properly resize a job's GRES bitmaps and counts when resizing the job.
  * Fix node being able to transition to CLOUD state from non-cloud state.
  * Fix regression introduced in 21.08.0rc1 which broke a step's ability to
    inherit GRES from the job when the step didn't request GRES but the job did.
  * Fix errors in logic when picking nodes based on bracketed anded constraints.
    This also enforces the requirement to have a count when using such
    constraints.
  * Handle job resize better in the database.
  * Exclude currently running, resized jobs from the runaway jobs list.
  * Make it possible to shrink a job more than once.

Thu Sep  2 13:19:33 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to 21.08.0, major changes:
  * A new "AccountingStoreFlags=job_script" option to store the job scripts
    directly in SlurmDBD.
  * Added "sacct -o SubmitLine" format option to get the submit line 
    of a job/step.
  * Changes to the node state management so that nodes are marked as PLANNED
    instead of IDLE if the scheduler is still accumulating resources while
    waiting to launch a job on them.
  * RS256 token support in auth/jwt.
  * Overhaul of the cgroup subsystems to simplify operation, mitigate a number
    of inherent race conditions, and prepare for future cgroup v2 support.
  * Further improvements to cloud node power state management.
  * A new child process of the Slurm controller called "slurmscriptd"
    responsible for executing PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld scripts,
    which significantly reduces performance issues associated with enabling
    those options.
  * A new burst_buffer/lua plugin allowing for site-specific asynchronous job
    data management.
  * Fixes to the job_container/tmpfs plugin to allow the slurmd process to be
    restarted while the job is running without issue.
  * Added json/yaml output to sacct, squeue, and sinfo commands.
  * Added a new node_features/helpers plugin to provide a generic way to change
    settings on a compute node across a reboot.
  * Added support for automatically detecting and broadcasting shared libraries
    for an executable launched with "srun --bcast".
  * Added initial OCI container execution support with a new --container option
    to sbatch and srun.
  * Improved "configless" support by allowing multiple control servers to be
    specified through the slurmd --conf-server option, and send additional
    configuration files at startup including cli_filter.lua.
- minor changes:
  * If an overallocation of GRES happens terminate the creation of a job.
  * AutoDetect=nvml: Fatal if no devices found in MIG mode.
  * Print federation and cluster sacctmgr error messages to stderr.

  * Don't destroy the memory step outside fini, which leads to a double destroy
    causing an error message.
  * Add support for lua 5.4.

  * srun - Fix force termination with -X.
  * On slurmctld restart set node typed GRES counts correctly.
  * Fix places where a step wasn't allocated in the slurmctld but wasn't ever
    removed from the job.
  * Fix step allocation memory when using --threads-per-core.
  * Fix step allocations to consume all threads on a core when using
    threads-per-core.
  * Add check to validate cpu request on a step if --threads-per-core is given
    and it is less than what the core on the node has in the allocation.
  * Fix issue where a step could request more gres than the job had and the step
    would hang forever. This bug was only introduced in 21.08.0rc2.
  * Only print \r\n for logging messages on stderr when --pty has been
    explicitly requested.
  * Relax check on SPANK plugins to only require Slurm major + minor versions
    to match.
  * job_container/tmpfs - delegate handling of /dev/shm to the extern step
    so new step launches will be attached correctly even after the slurmd
    process has been restarted.
  * Limit the wait time in proctrack_g_wait() to UnkillableStepTimeout instead

  * Add LimitFactor to the QOS. A float that is factored into an associations
    [Grp|Max]TRES limits.  For example, if the LimitFactor is 2, then an
    association with a GrpTRES of 30 CPUs, would be allowed to allocate 60
    CPUs when running under this QOS.
  * slurmrestd - Pass SLURM_NO_CHANGE_IN_DATA to client as 403 (Not Modified).

  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Add update_time field to nodes query to allow clients
    to only get nodes list based on change timestamp.
  * common/parse_config - catch and propagate return codes when handling a match
    on a key-value pattern. This implies error codes detected in the handlers
    are now not ignored and users of _handle_keyvalue_match() can fatal().
  * common/hostlist - fix hostlist_delete_nth() xassert() upper bound check.
  * API change: Removed slurm_kill_job_msg and modified the function signature
    for slurm_kill_job2. slurm_kill_job2 should be used instead of
    slurm_kill_job_msg.
  * Fix non-zero exit code for scontrol ping when all controllers are down.
  * Enforce a valid configuration for AccountingStorageEnforce in slurm.conf.
    If the configuration is invalid, then an error message will be printed and
    the command or daemon (including slurmctld) will not run.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.37 - Add update_time field to partitions/reservations query
    to allow clients to only get the entities list when something changed.

    SchedulerPort, SchedulerRootFilter options.
  * Make job accounting queries use consistent timeframes with and w/o jobs.
  * --cpus-per-task and --threads-per-core now imply --exact.
    This fixes issues where steps would be allocated the wrong number of CPUs.
  * configure: the --with option handling has been made consistent across the
    various optional libraries. Specifying *-with-foo=/path/to/foo will only
    check that directory for the applicable library (rather than, in some cases,
    falling back to the default directories), and will always error the build
    if the library is not found (instead of a mix of error messages and non-
    fatal warning messages).
  * configure: replace --with-rmsi_dir option with proper handling for
    *-with-rsmi=dir.
  * Pass additional job environment variables to MailProg.
  * Add SLURM_JOB_WORK_DIR to Prolog, Epilog.

    same directory as the slurm.conf file (and thus now will respect changes
    to the SLURM_CONF environment variable).
  * SPANK - call slurm_spank_init if defined without slurm_spank_slurmd_exit in
    slurmd context.
  * job_container/tmpfs - Remove need for .active file to allow salloc without
    an interactive step to work.
  * slurmd - Delay background node registration on every failure up to 128s on
    startup.
  * slurmctld - Always notify slurmd that node registration was accepted to
    avoid slurmd needless attempting to re-register if there is configuration
    issue.
  * Put node into "INVAL" state upon registering with an invalid node
    configuration. Node must register with a valid configuration to continue.
  * Make --cpu-bind=threads default for --threads-per-core -- cli and env can
    override.
  * jobcomp/elasticsearch - Use data_t to serialize data. The plugin now has the
    JSON-C library as a prerequisite.
  * scrontab - create the temporary file under the TMPDIR environment variable
    (if set), otherwise continue to use TmpFS as configured in slurm.conf.
  * Add LastBusyTime to "scontrol show nodes" and slurmrestd nodes output,
    which represents the time the node last had jobs on it.
  * slurmd - allow multiple comma-separated controllers to be specified in
    configless mode with *-conf-server
  * sacctmgr - changed column headings to "ParentID" and "ParentName" instead
    of "Par ID" and "Par Name" respectively.
  * Perl API - make sure man pages are installed under the --prefix given to
    configure.
  * Manually powering down of nodes with scontrol now ignores
    SuspendExc<Nodes|Parts>.
  * SALLOC_THREADS_PER_CORE and SBATCH_THREADS_PER_CORE have been added as
    input environment variables for salloc and sbatch, respectively. They do
    the same thing as *-threads-per-core.
  * Distinguish queued reboot requests (REBOOT) from issued reboots (REBOOT^).
  * Set the maximum number of open files per process to 4096 to avoid
    performance issues when closing the entire range with closeall().
  * auth/jwt - add support for RS256 tokens.
  * Relax reservation purge due to any invalid uid after creation time.
  * Reject srun that requests both --exclusive and --overlap.
  * service files - change dependency to network-online rather than just
    network to ensure DNS and other services are available.
  * RSMI: Fix incorrect PCI BDF bits.
  * plugins/cli_filter - Convert to using data_t to serialize JSON.
  * Fix testing array job after regaining locks in backfill.
  * Don't display node's comment with "scontrol show nodes" unless set.
  * Add "Extra" field to node to store extra information other than a comment.
  * scrontab - Use /tmp instead of TmpFS if TMPDIR is not set.
  * Add ResumeTimeout, SuspendTimeout and SuspendTime to Partitions.
  * sreport - change to sorting TopUsage by the --tres option.
  * slurmrestd - do not run allow operation as SlurmUser/root by default.
  * Allow map_cpu and mask_cpu for non-whole node allocation.
  * TaskPluginParam=verbose is now treated as a default. Previously it would be
    applied regardless of the job specifying a *-cpu-bind.
  * Add "node_reg_mem_percent" SlurmctldParameter to define percentage of
    memory nodes are allowed to register with.
  * Show correct number of SocketsPerBoard in slurmd -C with hwloc2.
  * Alter sreport's cluster utilization report column name from
    'Reserved' to 'Planned' to match the nomenclature of the 'Planned' node.
  * Add StateComplete format option to sinfo to show base_state+flags.
  * "scontrol show node" now shows State as base_state+flags instead of
    shortened state with flags appended. eg. IDLE# *> IDLE+POWERING_UP.
    Also "POWER" state flag string is "POWERED_DOWN".
  * slurmd/req - add missing job_env_t's het_job_id initialization off the
    request in _rpc_{abort,terminate}_job(). This caused problems for Native
    Cray builds when joining a CNCU job_container plugin with Epilog configured.
  * Fix joining a CNCU job_container on a Native Cray build before executing the
    UnkillableStepProgram for a HetJob step.
  * slurmrestd/v0.0.35 - Plugin has been tagged as deprecated.
  * srun - Job steps requiring more cores than available to be rejected unless
    '--overlap' is specificed.
  * Add bf_node_space_size to SchedulerParameters.
  * Add scontrol update node state=POWER_DOWN_FORCE and POWER_DOWN_ASAP as new
    ways to power off and reset especially CLOUD nodes.
  * Define and separate node power state transitions. Previously a powering
    down node was in both states, POWERING_OFF and POWERED_OFF. These are now
    separated.
  * Create a new process called slurmscriptd which runs PrologSlurmctld and
    EpilogSlurmctld. This avoids fork() calls from slurmctld, and can avoid
    performance issues if the slurmctld has a large memory footprint.
  * Added new Script option to DebugFlags for debugging slurmscriptd.
  * scrontab - add ability to update crontab from a file or standard input.
  * scrontab - add ability to set and expand variables.
  * Pass JSON of job to node mappings to ResumeProgram.
  * If running steps in an allocation with CR_PACK_NODE or -mpack the srun will
    only attempt to allocate as much as needed from the allocation instead
    of always trying to allocate every node in the allocation.
  * Jobs that request the whole node now check to see if any gres are allocated.
  * Rename SbcastParameters to BcastParameters.
  * Make srun sensitive to BcastParameters.
  * RSMI: Add gres_links_create_empty() and preserve RSMI enumeration order.
  * GPUs: Use index instead of dev_num for CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
  * Don't run epilog on nodes if job never launched.
  * QOS accrue limits only apply to the job QOS, not partition QOS.
  * Add --gpu-bind=per_task:<gpus_per_task> option, --gpus-per-task will now
    set this option by default.
  * Treat any return code from SPANK plugin that is not SLURM_SUCCESS to be an
    error or rejection.
  * Print the statistics for extern step adopted processes in sstat.
  * Fix SLURM_NODE_ALIASES to work for ipv6 node addrs.
  * Add support for automatically detecting and broadcasting executable shared
    object dependencies for sbcast and srun *-bcast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 10:13:23 UTC 2021 - Ana Guerrero Lopez <aguerrero@suse.com>

- Update to 20.11.03
- This release includes a major functional change to how job step launch is 
  handled compared to the previous 20.11 releases. This affects srun as 
  well as MPI stacks - such as Open MPI - which may use srun internally as 
  part of the process launch.
  One of the changes made in the Slurm 20.11 release was to the semantics 
  for job steps launched through the 'srun' command. This also 
  inadvertently impacts many MPI releases that use srun underneath their 
  own mpiexec/mpirun command.
  For 20.11.{0,1,2} releases, the default behavior for srun was changed  
  such that each step was allocated exactly what was requested by the 
  options given to srun, and did not have access to all resources assigned 
  to the job on the node by default. This change was equivalent to Slurm 
  setting the --exclusive option by default on all job steps. Job steps 
  desiring all resources on the node needed to explicitly request them 
  through the new '--whole' option.
  In the 20.11.3 release, we have reverted to the 20.02 and older behavior 
  of assigning all resources on a node to the job step by default.
  This reversion is a major behavioral change which we would not generally 
  do on a maintenance release, but is being done in the interest of 
  restoring compatibility with the large number of existing Open MPI (and 
  other MPI flavors) and job scripts that exist in production, and to 
  remove what has proven to be a significant hurdle in moving to the new 
  release.
  Please note that one change to step launch remains - by default, in 
  20.11 steps are no longer permitted to overlap on the resources they 
  have been assigned. If that behavior is desired, all steps must 
  explicitly opt-in through the newly added '--overlap' option.
  Further details and a full explanation of the issue can be found at:
  https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10383#c63

- Add support for configuration files from external plugins. 
  While built-in plugins have their configuration added in slurm.conf,
  external SPANK plugins add their configuration to plugstack.conf
  To allow packaging easily spank plugins, their configuration files
  should be added independently at /etc/spack/plugstack.conf.d and
  plugstack.conf should be left with an oneliner including all the
  files under /etc/spack/plugstack.conf.d

Tue Feb 11 10:09:43 UTC 2020 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Update to version 20.02.0-0pre1, highlights are
  Highlights:
 * Exclusive behavior of a node includes all GRES on a node as well
   as the cpus.
 * Use python3 instead of python for internal build/test scripts.
   The slurm.spec file has been updated to depend on python3 as well.
 * Added new NodeSet configuration option to help simplify partition
   configuration sections for heterogeneous / condo*style clusters.
 * Added slurm.conf option MaxDBDMsgs to control how many messages will be
   stored in the slurmctld before throwing them away when the slurmdbd is down.
 * The checkpoint plugin interface and all associated API calls have been
   removed.
 * slurm_init_job_desc_msg() initializes mail_type as uint16_t. This allows
   mail_type to be set to NONE with scontrol.
 * Add new slurm_spank_log() function to print messages back to the user from
   within a SPANK plugin without prepending "error: " from slurm_error().
 * Enforce having partition name and nodelist=ALL when creating reservations
   with flags=PART_NODES.
 * SPANK - removed never-implemented slurm_spank_slurmd_init() interface. This
   hook has always been accessible through slurm_spank_init() in the
   S_CTX_SLURMD context instead.
 * sbcast - add new BcastAddr option to NodeName lines to allow sbcast traffic
   to flow over an alternate network path.
 * Added auth/jwt plugin, and 'scontrol token' subcommand.  PMIx - improve
 * performance of proc map generation.  Deprecate kill_invalid_depend in
 * SchedulerParameters and move it to a new
   option called DependencyParameters.
 * Enable job dependencies for any job on any cluster in the same federation.
 * Allow clusters to be added automatically to db at startup of ctld.  Add
 * AccountingStorageExternalHost slurm.conf parameter.  The
 * "ConditionPathExists" condition in slurmd.service has been disabled by
   default to permit simpler installation of a "configless" Slurm cluster.
 * In SchedulerParameters remove deprecated max_job_bf and replace with
   bf_max_job_test.
 * Disable sbatch, salloc, srun --reboot for non-admins.  SPANK - added support
 * for S_JOB_GID in the job script context with
   spank_get_item().
 * Prolog/Epilog - add SLURM_JOB_GID environment variable.
 configuration file changes:
 * The mpi/openmpi plugin has been removed as it does nothing.
    MpiDefault=openmpi will be translated to the functionally-equivalent
    MpiDefault=none.
 command changes (see man pages for details)
 * Display StepId=<jobid>.batch instead of StepId=<jobid>.4294967294 in output
   of "scontrol show step". (slurm_sprint_job_step_info())
 * MPMD in srun will now defer PATH resolution for the commands to launch to
   slurmstepd. Previously it would handle resolution client*side, but with
   a non*standard approach that walked PATH in reverse.
 * squeue - added "--me" option, equivalent to --user=$USER.
 * The LicensesUsed line has been removed from 'scontrol show config'.
   Please see the 'scontrol show licenses' command as an alternative.
 * sbatch - adjusted backoff times for "--wait" option to reduce load on
   slurmctld. This results in a steady*state delay of 32s between queries,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 19 21:05:04 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Avoid running pretrans scripts when running in an instsys:
  there may be not much installed, yet. pretrans code should
  be done in lua, this way, it will be executed by the rpm-internal
  lua interpreter and not be passed to a shell which may not be
  around at the time this scriptlet is run (bsc#1090292).

  daemonizing process doesn't go away until the PID file
  with it PID of the daemon has bee written (bsc#1084125).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 11:27:31 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Make sure systemd services get restarted only when all
  packages are in a consistent state, not in the middle
  of an 'update' transaction (bsc#1088693).
  Since the %postun scripts that run on update are from
  the old package they cannot be changed - thus we work
  around the restart breakage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 13:50:14 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- fixed wrong log file location in slurmdbd.conf and 
  fixed pid location for slurmdbd and made slurm-slurmdbd
  depend on slurm config which provides the dir /var/run/slurm
  (bsc#1086859).

- Fix security issue in accounting_storage/mysql plugin by always escaping
  strings within the slurmdbd. CVE-2018-7033
  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-7033
  (bsc#1085240).
- Update slurm to v17.11.5 (FATE#325451)
  Highlights of 17.11:
  * Support for federated clusters to manage a single work-flow 
    across a set of clusters.
  * Support for heterogeneous job allocations (various processor types,
    memory sizes, etc. by job component). Support for heterogeneous job
    steps within a single MPI_COMM_WORLD is not yet supported for most
    configurations.
  * X11 support is now fully integrated with the main Slurm code. Remove
    any X11 plugin configured in your plugstack.conf file to avoid errors
    being logged about conflicting options.
  * Added new advanced reservation flag of "flex", which permits jobs
    requesting the reservation to begin prior to the reservation's 
    start time and use resources inside or outside of the reservation.
    A typical use case is to prevent jobs not explicitly requesting the
    reservation from using those reserved resources rather than forcing
    jobs requesting the reservation to use those resources in the time
    frame reserved.
  * The sprio command has been modified to report a job's priority
    information for every partition the job has been submitted to.
  * Group ID lookup performed at job submit time to avoid lookup on
    all compute nodes. Enable with PrologFlags=SendGIDs configuration
    parameter.
  * Slurm commands and daemons dynamically link to libslurmfull.so
    instead of statically linking. This dramatically reduces the
    footprint of Slurm.
  * In switch plugin, added plugin_id symbol to plugins and wrapped
    switch_jobinfo_t with dynamic_plugin_data_t in interface calls
    in order to pass switch information between clusters with different
    switch types.
  * Changed default ProctrackType to cgroup.
  * Changed default sched_min_interval from 0 to 2 microseconds.
  * Added new 'scontrol write batch_script ' command to fetch a job's
    batch script. Removed the ability to see the script as part of the 
    'scontrol -dd   show job' command.
  * Add new "billing" TRES which allows jobs to be limited based on the
    job's billable TRES calculated by the job's partition's
    TRESBillingWeights.
  * Regular user use of "scontrol top" command is now disabled. Use the
    configuration parameter "SchedulerParameters=enable_user_top" to
    enable that functionality. The configuration parameter
    "SchedulerParameters=disable_user_top" will be silently ignored.
  * Change default to let pending jobs run outside of reservation after
    reservation is gone to put jobs in held state. Added 
    NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER_END reservation flag to use old default.
    Support for PMIx v2.0 as well as UCX support.
  * Remove plugins for obsolete MPI stacks:
    - lam
    - mpich1_p4
    - mpich1_shmem
    - mvapich
  * Numerous fixes - check 'NEWS' file.
- slurmd-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch
  plugins-cgroup-Fix-slurmd-for-new-API-in-hwloc-2.0.patch:
  Removed. Code upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 04:01:28 UTC 2018 - jjolly@suse.com

- Moved slurmstepd and man page into slurm-node due to slurmd dependency
- Moved config files into slurm-node
- Moved slurmd rc scripts into slurm-node
- Made slurm-munge require slurm-plugins instead of slurm itself
  - slurm-node suggested slurm-munge, causing the whole slurm to be
    installed. The slurm-plugins seems to be a more base class
    (FATE#324574).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 17 14:21:49 UTC 2018 - cgoll@suse.com

- split up light wight slurm-node package for deployment on nodes

    satisfy a job's ntasks_per_core or socket specification.
 * If job is held for bad constraints make it so once updated the job doesn't
    go into JobAdminHeld.
 * sched/backfill - Fix logic to reserve resources for jobs that require a
    node reboot (i.e. to change KNL mode) in order to start.
 * When unpacking a node or front_end record from state and the protocol
    version is lower than the min version, set it to the min.
 * Remove redundant lookup for part_ptr when updating a reservation's nodes.
 * Fix memory and file descriptor leaks in slurmd daemon's sbcast logic.
 * Do not allocate specialized cores to jobs using the --exclusive option.
 * Cancel interactive job if Prolog failure with "PrologFlags=contain" or
   "PrologFlags=alloc" configured. Send new error prolog failure message to
   the salloc or srun command as needed.
 * Prevent possible out-of-bounds read in slurmstepd on an invalid #! line.
 * Fix check for PluginDir within slurmctld to work with multiple directories.
 * Cancel interactive jobs automatically on communication error to launching
   srun/salloc process.
 * Fix security issue caused by insecure file path handling triggered by the
   failure of a Prolog script. To exploit this a user needs to anticipate or
   cause the Prolog to fail for their job. CVE-2016-10030 (bsc#1018371).
- Replace group/user add macros with function calls.
- Fix array initialzation and ensure strings are always NULL terminated in
-  pam_slurm.c (bsc#1007053).
- Disable building with netloc support: the netloc API is part of the devel
  branch of hwloc. Since this devel branch was included accidentally and has
  been reversed since, we need to disable this for the time being.
- Conditionalized architecture specific pieces to support non-x86 architectures
  better.

Tue Jan  3 17:21:58 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Remove: unneeded 'BuildRequires:  python'
- Add:
  BuildRequires:  freeipmi-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibmad-devel
  BuildRequires:  libibumad-devel
  so they are picked up by the slurm build.
- Enable modifications from openHPC Project.
- Enable lua API package build.
- Add a recommends for slurm-munge to the slurm package:
  This is way, the munge auth method is available and slurm
  works out of the box.
- Create /var/lib/slurm as StateSaveLocation directory.
  /tmp is dangerous.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 22 21:42:04 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Fix build with and without OHCP_BUILD define.
- Fix build for systemd and non-systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  4 20:15:47 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Updated to 16-05-5 - equvalent to OpenHPC 1.2.
  * Fix issue with resizing jobs and limits not be kept track of correctly.
  * BGQ - Remove redeclaration of job_read_lock.
  * BGQ - Tighter locks around structures when nodes/cables change state.
  * Make it possible to change CPUsPerTask with scontrol.
  * Make it so scontrol update part qos= will take away a partition QOS from
    a partition.
  * Backfill scheduling properly synchronized with Cray Node Health Check.
    Prior logic could result in highest priority job getting improperly
    postponed.
  * Make it so daemons also support TopologyParam=NoInAddrAny.
  * If scancel is operating on large number of jobs and RPC responses from
    slurmctld daemon are slow then introduce a delay in sending the cancel job
    requests from scancel in order to reduce load on slurmctld.
  * Remove redundant logic when updating a job's task count.
  * MySQL - Fix querying jobs with reservations when the id's have rolled.
  * Perl - Fix use of uninitialized variable in slurm_job_step_get_pids.
  * Launch batch job requsting --reboot after the boot completes.
  * Do not attempt to power down a node which has never responded if the
    slurmctld daemon restarts without state.
  * Fix for possible slurmstepd segfault on invalid user ID.
  * MySQL - Fix for possible race condition when archiving multiple clusters
    at the same time.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Remove the SchedulerParameters option of "assoc_limit_continue", making it
    the default value. Add option of "assoc_limit_stop". If "assoc_limit_stop"
    is set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not attempt
    to initiate any lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can
    decrease system throughput and utlization, but avoid potentially starving
    larger jobs by preventing them from launching indefinitely.
  * Update a node's socket and cores per socket counts as needed after a node
    boot to reflect configuration changes which can occur on KNL processors.
    Note that the node's total core count must not change, only the distribution
    of cores across varying socket counts (KNL NUMA nodes treated as sockets by
    Slurm).
  * Rename partition configuration from "Shared" to "OverSubscribe". Rename
    salloc, sbatch, srun option from "--shared" to "--oversubscribe". The old
    options will continue to function. Output field names also changed in
    scontrol, sinfo, squeue and sview.
  * Add SLURM_UMASK environment variable to user job.
  * knl_conf: Added new configuration parameter of CapmcPollFreq.
  * Cleanup two minor Coverity warnings.
  * Make it so the tres units in a job's formatted string are converted like
    they are in a step.
  * Correct partition's MaxCPUsPerNode enforcement when nodes are shared by
    multiple partitions.
  * node_feature/knl_cray - Prevent slurmctld GRES errors for "hbm" references.
  * Display thread name instead of thread id and remove process name in stderr
    logging for "thread_id" LogTimeFormat.
  * Log IP address of bad incomming message to slurmctld.
  * If a user requests tasks, nodes and ntasks-per-node and
    tasks-per-node/nodes != tasks print warning and ignore ntasks-per-node.
  * Release CPU "owner" file locks.
  * Update seff to fix warnings with ncpus, and list slurm-perlapi dependency
    in spec file.
  * Allow QOS timelimit to override partition timelimit when EnforcePartLimits
    is set to all/any.
  * Make it so qsub will do a "basename" on a wrapped command for the output
    and error files.
  * Add logic so that slurmstepd can be launched under valgrind.
  * Increase buffer size to read /proc/*/stat files.
  * Prevent job stuck in configuring state if slurmctld daemon restarted while
    PrologSlurmctld is running. Also re-issue burst_buffer/pre-load operation
    as needed.
  * Move test for job wait reason value of BurstBufferResources and
    BurstBufferStageIn later in the scheduling logic.
  * Document which srun options apply to only job, only step, or job and step
    allocations.
  * Use more compatible function to get thread name (>= 2.6.11).
  * Make it so the extern step uses a reverse tree when cleaning up.
  * If extern step doesn't get added into the proctrack plugin make sure the
    sleep is killed.
  * Add web links to Slurm Diamond Collectors (from Harvard University) and
    collectd (from EDF).
  * Add job_submit plugin for the "reboot" field.
  * Make some more Slurm constants (INFINITE, NO_VAL64, etc.) available to
    job_submit/lua plugins.
  * Send in a -1 for a taskid into spank_task_post_fork for the extern_step.
  * MYSQL - Sightly better logic if a job completion comes in with an end time
    of 0.
  * task/cgroup plugin is configured with ConstrainRAMSpace=yes, then set soft
    memory limit to allocated memory limit (previously no soft limit was set).
  * Streamline when schedule() is called when running with message aggregation
    on batch script completes.
  * Fix incorrect casting when [un]packing derived_ec on slurmdb_job_rec_t.
  * Document that persistent burst buffers can not be created or destroyed using
    the salloc or srun --bb options.
  * Add support for setting the SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT, SLURM_JOB_QOS and
    SLURM_JOB_RESERVAION environment variables are set for the salloc command.
    Document the same environment variables for the salloc, sbatch and srun
    commands in their man pages.
  * Fix issue where sacctmgr load cluster.cfg wouldn't load associations
    that had a partition in them.
  * Don't return the extern step from sstat by default.
  * In sstat print 'extern' instead of 4294967295 for the extern step.
  * Make advanced reservations work properly with core specialization.
  * slurmstepd modified to pre-load all relevant plugins at startup to avoid
    the possibility of modified plugins later resulting in inconsistent API
    or data structures and a failure of slurmstepd.
  * Export functions from parse_time.c in libslurm.so.
  * Export unit convert functions from slurm_protocol_api.c in libslurm.so.
  * Fix scancel to allow multiple steps from a job to be cancelled at once.
  * Update and expand upgrade guide (in Quick Start Administrator web page).
  * burst_buffer/cray: Requeue, but do not hold a job which fails the pre_run
    operation.
  * Insure reported expected job start time is not in the past for pending jobs.
  * Add support for PMIx v2.

  Required for FATE#316379.

Mon Oct 17 13:25:52 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- Setting 'download_files' service to mode='localonly'
  and adding source tarball. (Required for Factory).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 18:11:39 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

- version 15.08.7.1
  * Remove the 1024-character limit on lines in batch scripts.
    task/affinity: Disable core-level task binding if more CPUs required than
    available cores.
  * Preemption/gang scheduling: If a job is suspended at slurmctld restart or
    reconfiguration time, then leave it suspended rather than resume+suspend.
  * Don't use lower weight nodes for job allocation when topology/tree used.
  * Don't allow user specified reservation names to disrupt the normal
    reservation sequeuece numbering scheme.
  * Avoid hard-link/copy of script/environment files for job arrays. Use the
    master job record file for all tasks of the job array.
    NOTE: Job arrays submitted to Slurm version 15.08.6 or later will fail if
    the slurmctld daemon is downgraded to an earlier version of Slurm.
  * In slurmctld log file, log duplicate job ID found by slurmd. Previously was
    being logged as prolog/epilog failure.
  * If a job is requeued while in the process of being launch, remove it's
    job ID from slurmd's record of active jobs in order to avoid generating a
    duplicate job ID error when launched for the second time (which would
    drain the node).
  * Cleanup messages when handling job script and environment variables in
    older directory structure formats.
  * Prevent triggering gang scheduling within a partition if configured with
    PreemptType=partition_prio and PreemptMode=suspend,gang.
  * Decrease parallelism in job cancel request to prevent denial of service
    when cancelling huge numbers of jobs.
  * If all ephemeral ports are in use, try using other port numbers.
  * Prevent "scontrol update job" from updating jobs that have already finished.
  * Show requested TRES in "squeue -O tres" when job is pending.
  * Backfill scheduler: Test association and QOS node limits before reserving
    resources for pending job.
  * Many bug fixes.
- Use source services to download package.
- Fix code for new API of hwloc-2.0.
- package netloc_to_topology where avialable.
- Package documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  1 13:45:52 UTC 2015 - scorot@free.fr

- update files list accordingly
- fix wrong end of line in some files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 19:06:18 UTC 2015 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.11.8
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file 
- update files list accordingly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  2 15:04:42 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.03.9
  * Many bug fixes. See NEWS file
- add systemd support 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 26 10:22:32 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- version 14.03.6
  * Added support for native Slurm operation on Cray systems
    (without ALPS).
  * Added partition configuration parameters AllowAccounts,
    AllowQOS, DenyAccounts and DenyQOS to provide greater control
    over use.
  * Added the ability to perform load based scheduling. Allocating
    resources to jobs on the nodes with the largest number if idle
    CPUs.
  * Added support for reserving cores on a compute node for system
    services (core specialization)
  * Add mechanism for job_submit plugin to generate error message
    for srun, salloc or sbatch to stderr.
  * Support for Postgres database has long since been out of date
    and problematic, so it has been removed entirely.  If you
    would like to use it the code still exists in <= 2.6, but will
    not be included in this and future versions of the code.
  * Added new structures and support for both server and cluster
    resources.
  * Significant performance improvements, especially with respect
    to job array support. 
- update files list

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 16 15:59:01 UTC 2014 - scorot@free.fr

- update to version 2.6.7
  * Support for job arrays, which increases performance and ease of
    use for sets of similar jobs.
  * Job profiling capability added to record a wide variety of job
    characteristics for each task on a user configurable periodic
    basis. Data currently available includes CPU use, memory use,
    energy use, Infiniband network use, Lustre file system use, etc.
  * Support for MPICH2 using PMI2 communications interface with much
    greater scalability.
  * Prolog and epilog support for advanced reservations.
  * Much faster throughput for job step execution with --exclusive
    option. The srun process is notified when resources become
    available rather than periodic polling.
  * Support improved for Intel MIC (Many Integrated Core) processor.
  * Advanced reservations with hostname and core counts now supports
    asymmetric reservations (e.g. specific different core count for
    each node).
  * External sensor plugin infrastructure added to record power
    consumption, temperature, etc.
  * Improved performance for high-throughput computing.
  * MapReduce+ support (launches ~1000x faster, runs ~10x faster).
  * Added "MaxCPUsPerNode" partition configuration parameter. This
    can be especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node
    can be associated with two Slurm partitions (e.g. "cpu" and
    "gpu") and the partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to only a
    subset of the node's CPUs, insuring that one or more CPUs would
    be available to jobs in the "gpu" partition/queue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  6 20:31:49 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.7
  * Fix for linking to the select/cray plugin to not give warning
    about undefined variable.
  * Add missing symbols to the xlator.h
  * Avoid placing pending jobs in AdminHold state due to backfill
    scheduler interactions with advanced reservation.
  * Accounting - make average by task not cpu.
  * POE - Correct logic to support poe option "-euidevice sn_all"
    and "-euidevice sn_single".
  * Accounting - Fix minor initialization error.
  * POE - Correct logic to support srun network instances count
    with POE.
  * POE - With the srun --launch-cmd option, report proper task
    count when the --cpus-per-task option is used without the
    --ntasks option.
  * POE - Fix logic binding tasks to CPUs.
  * sview - Fix race condition where new information could of
    slipped past the node tab and we didn't notice.
  * Accounting - Fix an invalid memory read when slurmctld sends
    data about start job to slurmdbd.
  * If a prolog or epilog failure occurs, drain the node rather
    than setting it down and killing all of its jobs.
  * Priority/multifactor - Avoid underflow in half-life calculation.
  * POE - pack missing variable to allow fanout (more than 32
    nodes)
  * Prevent clearing reason field for pending jobs. This bug was
    introduced in v2.5.5 (see "Reject job at submit time ...").
  * BGQ - Fix issue with preemption on sub-block jobs where a job
    would kill all preemptable jobs on the midplane instead of just
    the ones it needed to. 
  * switch/nrt - Validate dynamic window allocation size.
  * BGQ - When --geo is requested do not impose the default
    conn_types.
  * RebootNode logic - Defers (rather than forgets) reboot request
    with job running on the node within a reservation.
  * switch/nrt - Correct network_id use logic. Correct support for
    user sn_all and sn_single options.
  * sched/backfill - Modify logic to reduce overhead under heavy
    load.
  * Fix job step allocation with --exclusive and --hostlist option.
  * Select/cons_res - Fix bug resulting in error of "cons_res: sync
    loop not progressing, holding job #"
  * checkpoint/blcr - Reset max_nodes from zero to NO_VAL on job
    restart.
  * launch/poe - Fix for hostlist file support with repeated host
    names.
  * priority/multifactor2 - Prevent possible divide by zero.
    -- srun - Don't check for executable if --test-only flag is
    used.
  * energy - On a single node only use the last task for gathering
    energy. Since we don't currently track energy usage per task 
    (only per step). Otherwise we get double the energy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 11:13:17 UTC 2013 - scorot@free.fr

- version 2.5.4
  * Support for Intel® Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors.
  * User control over CPU frequency of each job step.
  * Recording power usage information for each job.
  * Advanced reservation of cores rather than whole nodes.
  * Integration with IBM's Parallel Environment including POE (Parallel
    Operating Environment) and NRT (Network Resource Table) API.
  * Highly optimized throughput for serial jobs in a new
    "select/serial" plugin.
  * CPU load is information available
  * Configurable number of CPUs available to jobs in each SLURM
    partition, which provides a mechanism to reserve CPUs for use
    with GPUs.
