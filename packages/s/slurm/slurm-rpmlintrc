# libslurm provides an ABI and a wire protocol. The wire protocol may change
# with any Slurm version in an incompatible way. The wire protocol is
# implemented in the library libslurm.
# Therefore, multiple versions of libslurm should not be installed on the
# same system.
# Thus, libraries depending on libslurm need to match the installed Slurm
# version - independent of their major versions.
# To host multiple Slurm versions in the same repository we add the version
# string to package names for none-base versions - even to library packages.
# This mainly applies to upgrade packages for Leap and SLE in the maintenance
# channel.
