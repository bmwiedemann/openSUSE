# libslurm provides an ABI and a wire protocol. The wire protocol may change
# with any SLURM version in an incompatible way. Therefore, multiple versions
# of libslurm should not be installed on the same system.
# Thus, libraries depending on libslurm need to match the installed SLURM
# version - independent of their major versions.
# To host multiple SLURM versions in the same repository we add the version
# string to package names for none-base versions - even to library packages.
# This mainly applies to upgrade packages for Leap and SLE in the maintenance
# channel.
