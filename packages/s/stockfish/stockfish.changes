- Update to version 14:
  The engine is now significantly stronger than just a few months
  ago, and wins four times more game pairs than it loses against 
  the previous release version. 
 
  Stockfish 14 is now at least 400 Elo ahead of Stockfish 7, a 
  top engine in 2016. During the last five years, Stockfish has thus 
  gained about 80 Elo per year.
- Refresh date.patch
