- Update to 18:
  Next-Generation Evaluation:
  * This release introduces the SFNNv10 network architecture. The network’s input
    layer has been augmented with 'Threat Inputs' features as part of a massive
    community effort. These features allow the engine to 'see' which pieces are
    threatened more naturally, resulting in more accurate evaluations.
  Hardware and Performance Optimizations:
  * A key highlight is the new 'Shared Memory' implementation, which allows
    different Stockfish processes to share the same memory space for neural
    network weights. This makes it the most efficient version for cloud
    analysis and high-concurrency testing.
  * Significant efforts have also been made to utilize hardware more
    effectively by adapting the code to make use of modern CPU instructions and
    refining how threads interact during a search.
  Search Improvements:
  * Stockfish 18 features a heavily refined search, utilizing 'Correction
    History' to dynamically adjust evaluations based on patterns found during
    the search itself. These and other refinements allow the engine to detect
    stalemates and evaluate fortresses significantly better than previous
    versions. A particularly rare issue, involving threefold repetition
    detection, en passant, and pins, was also fixed.
  Refactored Training Workflow:
  * The training of Stockfish's neural networks has transitioned to an
    automated and reproducible model. This new framework allows the project to
    employ standardized recipes to chain complex training stages together. This
    transition facilitates the training of networks using over 100 billion
    positions of Lc0 evaluation data.

- Update to 17.1:
  * Quality of chess play
    In our testing against its predecessor, Stockfish 17.1 shows a
    consistent improvement in performance, with an Elo gain of up
    to 20 points and winning close to 2 times more game pairs than
    it loses.
  * New speedtest command
    The new speedtest command benchmarks your computer's performance (measured
    in nodes per second) using a realistic and stable test. To run it, you'll
    need command line access—give it a try and share your results with the community!
  * Improved hardware support
    Stockfish is no longer limited to 1024 threads and will allow users to specify
    whatever their system is capable of. Additionally, hardware such as ppc64 and
    Loongson is now better supported at build time.
  * Bug fixes for tablebase support
    Our previous release introduced improved engine lines (principal variations)
    ending in mate as soon as a mate score is announced. A side effect of this
    improvement was a rare corner case involving cursed tablebase wins, only relevant
    in correspondence chess when the 50-move rule does not apply, which has now been
    fixed. Relatedly, time management has also been improved to avoid potential time losses.

Mon Sep  9 06:09:08 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 17:
  * Improved engine lines
    This release introduces principal variations (PVs) that are more
    informative for mate and decisive table base (TB) scores. In both
    cases, the PV will contain all moves up to checkmate. For mate scores,
    the PV shown is the best variation known to the engine at that point,
    while for table base wins, it follows, based on the TB, a sequence of
    moves that preserves the game outcome to checkmate.
  * NUMA performance optimization
    For high-end computers with multiple CPUs (typically a dual-socket
    architecture with 100+ cores), this release automatically improves
    performance with a NumaPolicy setting that optimizes non-uniform memory
    access (NUMA). Although typical consumer hardware will not benefit,
    speedups of up to 2.8x have been measured.

Mon Feb 26 12:09:26 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 16.1:
  * In our testing against its predecessor, Stockfish 16.1 shows a
    notable improvement in performance, with an Elo gain of up to
    27 points and winning over 2 times more game pairs than it loses.
  * Updated neural network architecture: The neural network architecture
    has undergone two updates and is currently in its 8th version.
  * Removal of handcrafted evaluation (HCE): This release marks the
    removal of the traditional handcrafted evaluation and the transition
    to a fully neural network-based approach.
  * Dual NNUE: For the first time, Stockfish includes a secondary neural
    network, used to quickly evaluate positions that are easily decided.
  * Use NNUE and UCI_AnalyseMode have been removed as they no longer had
    any effect. SlowMover has also been removed in favor of Move Overhead.
- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated PatchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  6 15:15:03 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 15.1:
  * Elo gain and competition results:
    With this release, version 5 of the NNUE neural net architecture
    has been introduced, and the training data has been extended to
    include Fischer random chess (FRC) positions. As a result, Elo
    gains are largest for FRC, reaching up to 50 Elo for doubly
    randomized FRC (DFRC). More importantly, also for standard chess
    this release progressed and will win two times more game pairs than
    it loses against Stockfish 15. 
  * New evaluation:
    This release also introduces a new convention for the evaluation
    that is reported by search. An evaluation of +1 is now no longer
    tied to the value of one pawn, but to the likelihood of winning the
    game. With a +1 evaluation, Stockfish has now a 50% chance of winning
    the game against an equally strong opponent. This convention scales
    down evaluations a bit compared to Stockfish 15 and allows for
    consistent evaluations in the future.

- Update to 15:
  Stockfish 15 continues to push the boundaries of chess, providing
  unrivalled analysis and playing strength. In our testing, Stockfish
  15 is ahead of Stockfish 14 by 36 Elo points and wins nine times
  more game pairs than it loses.

Sun Mar 27 18:37:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 14.1:
  Compared to Stockfish 14, this release introduces a more advanced NNUE
  architecture and various search improvements. In self play testing, using a
  book of balanced openings, Stockfish 14.1 wins three times more game pairs than
  it loses. At this high level, draws are very common, so the Elo difference to
  Stockfish 14 is about 17 Elo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  9 08:34:14 UTC 2021 - Stephan Kulow <coolo@suse.com>

- Update to version 14:
  The engine is now significantly stronger than just a few months
  ago, and wins four times more game pairs than it loses against 
  the previous release version. 
 
  Stockfish 14 is now at least 400 Elo ahead of Stockfish 7, a 
  top engine in 2016. During the last five years, Stockfish has thus 
  gained about 80 Elo per year.
