- Update to 15.1:
  * Elo gain and competition results:
    With this release, version 5 of the NNUE neural net architecture
    has been introduced, and the training data has been extended to
    include Fischer random chess (FRC) positions. As a result, Elo
    gains are largest for FRC, reaching up to 50 Elo for doubly
    randomized FRC (DFRC). More importantly, also for standard chess
    this release progressed and will win two times more game pairs than
    it loses against Stockfish 15. 
  * New evaluation:
    This release also introduces a new convention for the evaluation
    that is reported by search. An evaluation of +1 is now no longer
    tied to the value of one pawn, but to the likelihood of winning the
    game. With a +1 evaluation, Stockfish has now a 50% chance of winning
    the game against an equally strong opponent. This convention scales
    down evaluations a bit compared to Stockfish 15 and allows for
    consistent evaluations in the future.

- Update to 15:
  Stockfish 15 continues to push the boundaries of chess, providing
  unrivalled analysis and playing strength. In our testing, Stockfish
  15 is ahead of Stockfish 14 by 36 Elo points and wins nine times
  more game pairs than it loses.
- Add stockfish-remove-net.patch: Don't try to donwload nnue

- update to 14.1:
  Compared to Stockfish 14, this release introduces a more advanced NNUE
  architecture and various search improvements. In self play testing, using a
  book of balanced openings, Stockfish 14.1 wins three times more game pairs than
  it loses. At this high level, draws are very common, so the Elo difference to
  Stockfish 14 is about 17 Elo

- Update to version 14:
  The engine is now significantly stronger than just a few months
  ago, and wins four times more game pairs than it loses against 
  the previous release version. 
 
  Stockfish 14 is now at least 400 Elo ahead of Stockfish 7, a 
  top engine in 2016. During the last five years, Stockfish has thus 
  gained about 80 Elo per year.
- Refresh date.patch

    more game pairs than it loses
