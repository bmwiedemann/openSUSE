Since shim needs a "stable" environment to reproduce the binary to match
the signature from UEFI CA, it's difficult to maintain shim in Tumbleweed
due to the nature of a rolling release distro. Instead of compiling shim
for Tumbleweed, we directly import the binary the latest stable Leap
release to maintain a stable and reproducible shim binary.
