  <title>SSLv3/TLS Network Protocol Analyzer</title>
  <description>ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
decodes the records and outputs them in a textual form to stdout. If
provided with the appropriate keying material, it also decrypts the
connections and displays the application data traffic.</description>
