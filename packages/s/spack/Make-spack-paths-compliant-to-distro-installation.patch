Subject: [PATCH] Make spack paths compliant to distro installation

Spack is particular about the choice of 'prefix' which will
replace $spack. 'prefix' is the 4th ancestor of paths.py, so
it is relative to the spack installation.
This will only change the coded setups of
var_path -> /var/lib/spack
opt_path -> /opt/spack
repo_path -> /usr/share/spack/repos
