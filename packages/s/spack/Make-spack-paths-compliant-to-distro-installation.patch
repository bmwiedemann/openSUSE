Subject: Make spack paths compliant to distro installation
Patch-mainline: Not yet
Git-repo: https://github.com/spack/spack
Git-commit: f91da8159ac285f41d215f0bf7d3a15461e63324
References: 

Spack is particular about the choice of 'prefix' which will
replace $spack. 'prefix' is the 4th ancestor of paths.py, so
it is relative to the spack installation.
This will only change the coded setups of
var_path -> /var/lib/spack
opt_path -> /opt/spack
