- Move-site-config-scope-before-system-scope.patch:
  Give 'site' scope a lower precedence than 'system' scope.
  The 'site wide' config scope was meant to be per Spack
  installation. A single system may have multiple Spack
  installations, so was is meant for overriding the
  'system' wide setting per installation.
  The Spack package is OS-vendor provided. The vendor provides
  pr generates a configuration which a local admin may want to
  override. This can now be done from within the 'system' scope.
  Previously the vendor-supplied configuration was mixed with
  the 'system' scope - local modifications collided with
  vendor autoconfiguration.
- Add a build-dependency package which will cause build tools
  and libraries used frequently by Spack to be installed.
  All these packages are recommended by the main Spack package
  already. This package may be used in environments where the
  installation of recommended packages is disabled by default.

- Update Spack to version 0.22.0
  * New features:
    - Compiler dependencies:
      Spack is in the process of making compilers proper dependencies.
      For this, compiler dependencies are moving from `compilers.yaml`
      to `packages.yaml` to make this consistent with other externals.
      For this, dependency graphs will not show the compiler runtime
      libraries like `gcc-runtime` or `libgfortran`.
      To minimize disruption, an existing `compilers.yaml` file will
      continue to work, however, users are encourage to migrate
      before v0.23.
      + Packages compiled with `%gcc` now depend on a new package
        `gcc-runtime`, which contains a copy of the shared compiler
        runtime libraries. This enables gcc runtime libraries to be
        installed and relocated when using a build cache.
        When building minimal Spack-generated container images it
        is no longer necessary to install libgfortran, libgomp
        etc. using the system package manager.
      + Packages compiled with `%oneapi` now depend on a new package
        `intel-oneapi-runtime`. This is similar to gcc-runtime.
        This allows us to model library soname compatibility and
        allows compilers like %oneapi to provide virtuals like sycl
        (which can also be provided by standalone libraries).
      + Changes to the optimization criteria of the solver improve
        the hit-rate of buildcaches by a fair amount. The solver has
        more relaxed compatibility rules and will not try to strictly
        match compilers or targets of reused specs. Users can still
        enforce the previous strict behavior with require: sections
        in packages.yaml.
        Note that to enforce correct linking, Spack will not reuse
        old %gcc and %oneapi specs that do not have the runtime
        libraries as a dependency.
      + Spack will reuse specs built with compilers that are not
        explicitly configured in `compilers.yaml`. Because we can
        now keep runtime libraries in build cache, we do not require
        you to also have a local configured compiler to use the
        runtime libraries. This improves reuse in buildcaches and
        avoids conflicts with OS updates that happen underneath
        Spack.
      + Binary compatibility on `linux` is now based on the `libc`
        version, instead of on the OS tag. Spack builds now detect
        the host `libc` (`glibc`) and add it as an implicit external
        node in the dependency graph. Binaries with a `libc` with
        the same name and a version less than or equal to that of
        the detected libc can be reused.
      + Each package that can provide a compiler is now detectable
        using spack external find. External packages defining
        compiler paths are effectively used as compilers, and spack
        external find -t compiler` can be used as a substitute for
        `spack compiler find. More details on this transition are
        in [the docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#manual-compiler-configuration).
    - Improved spack find UI for Environments:
      `spack find` in environments shows information about
      * What are the roots
      * Which ones are installed / not installed
      * What's been added that still needs to be concretized
      much more clearly. An option `--only-roots`/`-r` has been added
      to `spack find` that will only show env roots, if you don't want
      to look at all the installed specs.
    - Improved command-line string quoting
      Spack now parses specs in the CLI respecting shell quoting. Instead
      of:
      ```
      spack install zlib cflags=\"-O2 -g\"
      ```
      you should use:
      ```
      spack install zlib cflags="-O2 -g"
      ```
      The old form will now result in an error.
      This allows to include special characters, flags like
      ```
      spack intall zlib ldflags='-Wl,-rpath=$ORIGIN/_libs'
      ```
      may now be supplied. To reduce ambiguities during paring, quotes
      are no longer allowed around `=` and `==`. Commands like:
      ```
      spack install zlib cflags = "-O2 -g"
      ```
      will result in an error.
    - Revert default spack install behavior to `--reuse`
      In v0.20 the default concretizer behavior was changed from
      `--reuse` to `--reuse-deps`, which meant that *every* `spack
      install` invocation would attempt to build a new version of
      the requested package / any environment roots.
      While this is a common ask for *upgrading* and for *developer
      workflows*, it shouldn't be the default for a package manager.
    - The `install` command now offers the three options:
      * `--reuse` (default): reuse as many existing installations
        as possible.
      * `--reuse-deps` or `--fresh-roots`: upgrade (freshen) roots
        but reuse dependencies if possible.
      * --fresh: install fresh versions of requested packages
        (roots) and their dependencies.
    - More control over reused specs
      Spack now provides better control over which packages to reuse
      and how. There is a new `concretizer:reuse` config option,
      which accepts the following properties:
      * `roots`: true to reuse roots, false to reuse just dependencies
      * `exclude`: list of constraints used to select which specs
        not to reuse.
      * `include`: list of constraints used to select which specs
        to reuse.
      * `from`: list of sources for reused specs (some combination
         of `local`, `buildcache`, or `external`).
    - New `conflict:` and `prefer:` syntax for package preferences
      Instead of having to express conflicts and preferences just
      using `require:`, these can now be expressed explicitly.
    - `include_concrete` in environments
      This directive allows to build on the *cncrete* contents of
      another environment without changing this environment by
      includeing the concrete specs from this environment's
      `spack.lock`:
      ```
       spack:
         specs: []
         concretizer:
             unify: true
         include_concrete:
         - /path/to/environment1
         - /path/to/environment2
      ```
      When this environment is concretized, it will bring the
      already concrete specs from `environment1` and `environment2`,
      and build on top of them without changing them.
    - `python-venv` isolation
      Spack now insert a small `python-venv` package in between
      `python` and packages that need to install Python code to
      isolate Spack's build environment and shield Spack form
      potential issues with an external python.
    - Packages can now specify whether they may be distributed in
      source or binary form.
  * New commands, options and directives
    - Allow packages to be pushed to build cache after install from
      source.
    _ `spack develop`: stage build artifacts in same root as non-dev
      builds.
    - Don't delete spack develop build artifacts after install.
    - `spack find`: add options for local/upstream only.
    - `spack logs`: print log files for packages (either partially
      built or installed).
    - `patch`: support reversing patches.
    - `develop`: Add `-b`/`--build-directory` option to set
      build_directory package attribute.
    - `spack list`: add `--namesapce` / `--repo` option.
    - spack gc: add options for environments and build dependencies.
    - Add `--create` to `spack env activate`.
  * Performance improvements
    - environment.py: Fix excessive re-reads.
    - ruamel yaml: Fix quadratic complexity bug.
    - Refactor to improve `spec format` speed.
    - Do not acquire a write lock on the env post install if no views.
    - `asp.py`: fewer calls to `spec.copy()`
    - `spec.py`: early return in `__str__`
    - avoid `jinja2` import at startup unless needed.
  * Other new features of note
    - `archspec`: update to v0.2.4: bugfixes for `neoverse-v1` and
      `neoverse-v2` detection.
    - `spack config` get/blame: with no args, show entire config
    - `spack env create <env>`: dir if dir-like
    - Add handling of custom ssl certs in urllib ops.
    - Add ability to rename environments.
    - Add config option and compiler support to reuse across OS's.
    - Support for prereleases.
    - Only reuse externals when configured.
    - Environments: Add support for including views.
  * Binary caches
    Build cache: make signed/unsigned a mirror property.
  * Removals, deprecations, and syntax changes
    - Remove `dpcpp` compiler and package.
    - `spack load`: remove `--only` argument.
  * Notable Bugfixes
    - repo.py: drop deleted packages from provider cache.
    - Allow `+` in module file names.
    - `cmd/python`: use runpy to allow multiprocessing in scripts.
    - Show extension commands with `spack -h`.
    - Support environment variable expansion inside module
      projections.
    - Alert user to failed concretizations.
    - `shell`: fix `zsh` color formatting for PS1 in environments.
    - `spack mirror create --all`: include patches.
- Update `run-find-external.sh` script to address the deprecation
  of `compilers.yaml`.

- Update Spack to version 0.21.1
  * Add support for reading buildcaches created by Spack v0.22

    + environment: fix an issue with deconcretization/reconcretization
      of specs.
    + buildcache: don't error if a patch is missing, when
      installing from binaries
- From version 0.21.0
  * following new features:
    + Better error messages with condition chaining:
      In v0.18, we added better error messages that could tell you
      what problem happened, but they couldn't tell you why it
      happened. 0.21 adds condition chaining to the solver, and
      Spack can now trace back through the conditions that led to
      an error and build a tree of causes potential causes and
      where they came from.
    + OCI build caches:
      You can now use an arbitrary OCI registry as a build cache:
      - For Dockerhub:
        `$ spack mirror add my_registry oci://user/image`
      - For another registry (GHCR):
        `$ spack mirror add my_registry oci://ghcr.io/haampie/spack-test`
      Then set the login credentials:
      `$ spack mirror set --push --oci-username ... --oci-password ... my_registry`
      and push to it:
      `$ spack buildcache push my_registry [specs...]`
      You can optionally add a base image to get runnable images:
      ```
      $ spack buildcache push --base-image leap:15.5 my_registry python`
       Pushed ... as [image]:python-3.11.2-65txfcpqbmpawclvtasuog4yzmxwaoia.spack
       $ docker run --rm -it [image]:python-3.11.2-65txfcpqbmpawclvtasuog4yzmxwaoia.spack
       ```
      This creates a container image from the Spack installations
      on the host system, without the need to run `spack install`
      from a `Dockerfile` or `sif` file. It also addresses the
      inconvenience of losing binaries of dependencies when
      `RUN spack install` fails inside `docker build`. Further, the
      container image layers and build cache tarballs are the same
      files. This means that `spack install` and `docker pull` use the
      exact same underlying binaries. If you previously used `spack
      install` inside of docker build, this feature helps you save
      storage by a factor two.
    + Multiple versions of build dependencies:
      Increasingly, complex package builds require multiple
      versions of some build dependencies. For example, Python
      packages frequently require very specific versions of
      `setuptools`, `cython`, while different physics packages
      require different versions of Python to build. The concretizer
      enforced that every solve was unified, i.e., so that there was
      only one version of every package. The concretizer now supports
      "duplicate" nodes for build dependencies, but enforces unification
      through transitive link and run dependencies. This will allow it
      to better resolve complex dependency graphs in ecosystems like
      Python.
    + Cherry-picking virtual dependencies:
      You can now select only a subset of virtual dependencies
      from a spec that may provide more. For example, to make mpich
      your mpi provider, you can be explicit by writing:
      `hdf5 ^[virtuals=mpi] mpich`.
      Or, to use, e.g., `intel-parallel-studio` for blas along with
      an external `lapack` like `openblas`, you could write:
      ```
      strumpack ^[virtuals=mpi] intel-parallel-studio+mkl ^[virtuals=lapack] openblas`
      ```
      The `virtuals=mpi` is an edge attribute, and dependency edges
      in Spack graphs now track which virtuals they satisfied.
    + The `spack deconcretize` command gives you control over what
      you want to update in an already concrete environment.
      As an example, with an environment built with meson, and you
      want to update your meson version, you can run:
      `$spack deconcretize meson`
      and have everything that depends on meson rebuilt the next
      time you run spack concretize. In the future, we'll handle
      this in a single command, but for now you can use this to
      drop bits of your lockfile and resolve your dependencies
      again.
    + UI Improvements:
      The `spack info` received a rework to make the output more
      appealing. It is now on par with  the rest of Spack's UI.
      `spack info` now makes much better use of terminal space and
      shows variants, their values, and their descriptions more
      clearly. Conditional variants are grouped separately so you
      can more easily understand how packages are structured.
      `spack checksum` now allows you to filter versions from your
      editor, or by version range. It also notifies you about
      potential download URL changes.
    + Environments can include definitions:
      Spack did not previously support using `include:` with The
      definitions section of an environment, but now it does. You
      can use this to curate lists of specs and more easily reuse
      them across environments.
    + Aliases:
      You can now add aliases to Spack commands in `config.yaml`,
      e.g. this might enshrine your favorite args to `spack find`
      as `spack f`:
      ```
      config:
        aliases:
          f: find -lv
      ```
    + Improved autoloading of modules:
      In this release, you can start using `hide_implicits: true`
      instead, which exposes only explicitly installed packages to
      the user, while still autoloading dependencies. On top of
      that, you can safely use `hash_length: 0`, as this config now
      only applies to the modules exposed to the user -- you don't
      have to worry about file name clashes for hidden
      dependencies.
      Note: for Tcl this feature requires Modules 4.7 or higher.
  * Other new commands and directives:
    + `spack env activate` without arguments now loads a default
      environment that you do not have to create.
    + `spack find -H` / `--hashes`: a new shortcut for piping spack
      find output to other commands.
    + Add `spack checksum --verify`, fix `--add`.
    + New `default_args` context manager factors out common args for
      directives.
    + `spack compiler find --[no]-mixed-toolchain` lets you easily
      mix clang and gfortran on Linux.
  * Performance improvements:
    + `spack external find execution` is now much faster.
    + `spack location -i` is now much faster on success.
    + Drop redundant rpaths post install.
    + ASP-based solver: avoid cycles in clingo using hidden
      directive.
    + Fix multiple quadratic complexity issues in environments.
  * Other new features of note:
    + archspec: update to v0.2.2, support for Sapphire Rapids,
      Power10, Neoverse V2.
    + Propagate variants across nodes that don't have that variant
    + Implement fish shell completion.
    + Can now distinguish between source/binary mirror; don't ping
      mirror.spack.io as much.
    + Improve status reporting on `spack install`
      (add [n/total] display...).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 22 14:40:17 UTC 2023 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.20.0 with the following features:
  * Exact versions: Spack did not previously have a way to distinguish a
    version if it was a prefix of some other version. For example, @3.2 would
    match 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, etc. You can now match exactly 3.2 with @=3.2.
    This is useful, for example, if you need to patch only the 3.2 version of a
    package
  * More stable concretization: Now, spack concretize will only concretize the
    new portions of the environment and will not change existing parts of an
    environment unless you specify --force.  This has always been true for
    unify:false, but not for unify:true and unify:when_possible environments.
  * The concretizer has a new --reuse-deps argument that only reuses dependencies.
    That is, it will always treat the roots of your environment as it would with
    --fresh. This allows you to upgrade just the roots of your environment while
    keeping everything else stable
  * Specs in buildcaches can be referenced by hash: Previously, you could run
    spack buildcache list and see the hashes in buildcaches, but referring to
    them by hash would fail.  You can now run commands like spack spec and
    spack install and refer to buildcache hashes directly, e.g. spack install
    /abc123
  * New package and buildcache index websites
    Our public websites for searching packages have been completely revamped
    and updated.  You can check them out here:
      Package Index: https://packages.spack.io
      Buildcache Index: https://cache.spack.io
    Both are searchable and more interactive than before. Currently major
    releases are shown; UI for browsing develop snapshots is coming soon.
  * Default CMake and Meson build types are now Release: Spack has historically
    defaulted to building with optimization and debugging, but packages like
    llvm can be enormous with debug turned on. Our default build type for all
    Spack packages is now Release. This has a number of benefits:
      much smaller binaries;
      higher default optimization level; and
    defining NDEBUG disables assertions, which may lead to further speedups.
    You can still get the old behavior back through requirements and package
    preferences
  * spack checksum can automatically add new versions to package
  * new command: spack pkg grep to easily search package files
  * New maintainers directive
  * Add spack buildcache push (alias to buildcache create)
  * Allow using -j to control the parallelism of concretization
  * Add --exclude option to 'spack external find'
    requires() directive and enhanced package requirements We've added some
    more enhancements to requirements in Spack. There is a new requires()
    directive for packages. requires() is the opposite of conflicts()

- removed Add-zypper-to-the-valid-container.os_packages-commands.patch 
  as incoperated upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 17 06:59:15 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.19.2 with the following bug fixes:
  * Ignore global variant requirement for packages that do not define it.
  * Compiler wrapper: improved parsing of linker arguments.
  * Views: fix support for optional Python extensions.
  * Views: fix issue where Python executable gets symlinked instead of copied.
  * Fix a bug where tests were not added when concretizing together.
  * Increase db timeout from 3s to 60s to improve stability of parallel
    installs.
  * Buildcache: improve error handling in downloads.
  * Module files for packages installed from buildcache have long placeholder
    paths abbreviated in configure args section.
  * Ensure file with build environment variables is truncated when writing
    to it.
  * spack config update now works on active environments;
- Add:
  Add-zypper-to-the-valid-container.os_packages-commands.patch
  This adds `zypper` to the valid OS package managers that can
  be specified in a slack.yaml container description like:
  spack:
    ...
    container:
      ..
      os_packages:
        command: zypper
	..
- Add: spack_get_libs.sh
  This scripts obtains library and include paths for spack-build
  libraries and outputs shell commands which set these as
  environment variables.
  Additionally, it generates a command line to prepend these lib
  directories to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Thus, the variables can be set
  in the current shell by running `source $(spack_get_libs.sh foo)`.
  When using `bash` this script may also be sourced directly.
  The names of the environment variables are the upper-cased library
  names with the strings 'LIB_' and 'INC_' prepended. Thus, for a
  library 'foo', they would be 'INC_FOO' and 'LIB_FOO'.
  These variables may be used at build time to point the compiler
  to the include and library files (bsc#1208751).
- Drop:
  Make-sure-spack-environment-is-set-up-in-Dockerfile-template.patch
  This patch should not be needed. When building using `podman` use:
  `podman build --format docker ...` to enable the non-OCI compliant
  instructions in a Dockerfile.
- Add info, makeinfo, libcurl-devel, patchelf to the recommended
  packages to add.
  Fix: openssl-devel -> libopenssl-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Make-sure-spack-environment-is-set-up-in-Dockerfile-template.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 13:04:37 UTC 2023 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Fix var_path: this regression was introduced with the update
  to the 0.19.0 release (boo#1207053).
- Move repos to /usr/share/spack: /var is strictly for local data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 22 11:16:26 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to version 0.19.0 with the following changes:
  * Spack's traditional package preferences are soft, but we've added hard
    requriements to packages.yaml and spack.yaml
  * spack install in an environment will no longer add to the specs: list; you'll
    need to either use spack add <spec> or spack install --add <spec>.
  * spack uninstall will not remove from your environment's specs:
    list; you'll need to use spack remove or spack uninstall --remove.
  * concretizer:unify:true is now the default mode for new environments
  * include environment configuration from URLs
  * An increasing number of packages in the ecosystem need the ability to
    support multiple build systems
  * package ++variant:
    enabled variant that will be propagated to dependencies
  * git. prefix to specify git tags or branches as versions. All of these are
    valid git versions in
  * spack ci generate --tests will generate a .gitlab-ci.yml file that not only
    does builds but also runs tests for built packages
  * spack test run --explicit will only run tests for packages that are
    explicitly installed, instead of all packages.
  * You can add a new shared_linking option to config.yaml to make Spack embed absolute paths
    to needed shared libraries in ELF executables and shared libraries on Linux
  * spack spec prints dependencies more legibly. Dependencies in the output now
    appear at the earliest level of indentation possible (#33406)
  * You can override package.py attributes like url, directly in packages.yaml
  * There are a number of new architecture-related format strings you can use
    in Spack configuration files to specify paths
- Improvements from v0.18.0
  * spack install --reuse was introduced in v0.17.0, and --reuse is now the
    default concretization mode. Spack will try hard to resolve dependencies
    using installed packages or binaries
  * Spack hashes now include link, run, and build dependencies, as well as a
    canonical hash of package recipes. Previously, hashes only included link
    and run dependencies (though build dependencies were stored by
    environments). We coarsened the hash to reduce churn in user installations,
    but the new default concretizer behavior mitigates this concern and gets us
    reuse and provenance.  You will be able to see the build dependencies of
    new installations
  * concretizer:unify:when_possible will try to resolve a fully unified
    environment, but if it cannot, it will create multiple configurations of
    some packages where it has to.  with spack find.
  * Spack now has an updated binary format, with improvements for security. The
    new format has a detached signature file, and Spack verifies the signature
    before untarring or decompressing the binary package. The previous format
    embedded the signature in a tar file, which required the client to run tar
    before verifying (#30750). Spack can still install from build caches using
    the old format, but we encourage users to switch to the new format going
    forward.
  * The spack bootstrap mirror command can automatically create a mirror for
    bootstrapping the concretizer and other needed dependencies in an
    air-gapped environment.
  * spack env depfile can be used to generate a Makefile from an environment,
    which can be used to build packages the environment in parallel on a single
    node
  * In addition to being conditional themselves, variants can now have
    conditional values that are only possible for certain configurations of a
    package.
- removed following patches as incorporated upstream:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  8 14:55:34 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to version 0.17.0
  (Upstream feature/bug references (<ID>) are relative to
   https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/<ID>).
  * New concretizer is now default
    The new concretizer introduced as an experimental feature in v0.16.0
    is now the default (#25502). The new concretizer is based on the
    clingo logic programming system,
    and it enables us to do much higher quality and faster dependency solving
    The old concretizer is still available via the concretizer: original
    setting, but it is deprecated and will be removed in v0.18.0.
  * Binary Bootstrapping
    To make it easier to use the new concretizer and binary packages,
    Spack now bootstraps clingo and GnuPG from public binaries. If it
    is not able to bootstrap them from binaries, it installs them from
    source code. With these changes, you should still be able to clone Spack
    and start using it almost immediately.
  * Reuse existing packages (experimental)
    The most wanted feature from our
    2020 user survey and
    the most wanted Spack feature of all time (#25310). spack install,
    spack spec, and spack concretize now have a --reuse option, which
    causes Spack to minimize the number of rebuilds it does. The --reuse
    option will try to find existing installations and binary packages locally
    and in registered mirrors, and will prefer to use them over building new
    versions. This will allow users to build from source far less than in
    prior versions of Spack. This feature will continue to be improved, with
    configuration options and better CLI expected in v0.17.1. It will become
    the default concretization mode in v0.18.0.
  * Better error messages
    We have improved the error messages generated by the new concretizer by
    using unsatisfiable cores. Spack will now print a summary of the types
    of constraints that were violated to make a spec unsatisfiable (#26719).
  * Conditional variants
    Variants can now have a when="<spec>" clause, allowing them to be
    conditional based on the version or other attributes of a package (#24858).
  * Git commit versions
    In an environment and on the command-line, you can now provide a full,
    40-character git commit as a version for any package with a top-level
    git URL. e.g., spack install hdf5@45bb27f58240a8da7ebb4efc821a1a964d7712a8.
    Spack will compare the commit to tags in the git repository to understand
    what versions it is ahead of or behind.
  * Override local config and cache directories
    You can now set SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG to disable the ~/.spack and
    /etc/spack configuration scopes. SPACK_USER_CACHE_PATH allows you to
    move caches out of ~/.spack, as well (#27022, #26735). This addresses
    common problems where users could not isolate CI environments from local
    configuration.
  * Improvements to Spack Containerize
    For added reproducibility, you can now pin the Spack version used by
    spack containerize (#21910). The container build will only build
    with the Spack version pinned at build recipe creation instead of the
    latest Spack version.
  * New commands for dealing with tags
    The spack tags command allows you to list tags on packages (#26136), and you
    can list tests and filter tags with spack test list (#26842).
  * Copy and relocate environment views as stand-alone installations (#24832)
  * spack diff command can diff two installed specs (#22283, #25169)
  * spack -c <config> can set one-off config parameters on CLI (#22251)
  * spack load --list is an alias for spack find --loaded (#27184)
  * spack gpg can export private key with --secret (#22557)
  * spack style automatically bootstraps dependencies (#24819)
  * spack style --fix automatically invokes isort (#24071)
  * build dependencies can be installed from build caches with --include-build-deps (#19955)
  * spack audit command for checking package constraints (#23053)
  * spack can now fetch from CVS repositories (yep, really) (#23212)
  * spack monitor lets you upload analysis about installations to a
  * spack monitor server (#23804, #24321, #23777, #25928))
  * spack python --path shows which python Spack is using (#22006)
  * spack env activate --temp can create temporary environments (#25388)
  * --preferred and --latest options for spack checksum (#25830)
  * SPACK_PYTHON environment variable sets which python spack uses (#21222)
  * SPACK_SKIP_MODULES lets you source setup-env.sh faster if you don't need modules (#24545)
