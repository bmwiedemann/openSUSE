Tue Nov 22 11:16:26 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to version 0.19.0 with the following changes:
  * Spack's traditional package preferences are soft, but we've added hard
    requriements to packages.yaml and spack.yaml
  * spack install in an environment will no longer add to the specs: list; you'll
    need to either use spack add <spec> or spack install --add <spec>.
  * spack uninstall will not remove from your environment's specs:
    list; you'll need to use spack remove or spack uninstall --remove.
  * concretizer:unify:true is now the default mode for new environments
  * include environment configuration from URLs
  * An increasing number of packages in the ecosystem need the ability to
    support multiple build systems
  * package ++variant:
    enabled variant that will be propagated to dependencies
  * git. prefix to specify git tags or branches as versions. All of these are
    valid git versions in
  * spack ci generate --tests will generate a .gitlab-ci.yml file that not only
    does builds but also runs tests for built packages
  * spack test run --explicit will only run tests for packages that are
    explicitly installed, instead of all packages.
  * You can add a new shared_linking option to config.yaml to make Spack embed absolute paths
    to needed shared libraries in ELF executables and shared libraries on Linux
  * spack spec prints dependencies more legibly. Dependencies in the output now
    appear at the earliest level of indentation possible (#33406)
  * You can override package.py attributes like url, directly in packages.yaml
  * There are a number of new architecture-related format strings you can use
    in Spack configuration files to specify paths
- Improvements from v0.18.0
  * spack install --reuse was introduced in v0.17.0, and --reuse is now the
    default concretization mode. Spack will try hard to resolve dependencies
    using installed packages or binaries
  * Spack hashes now include link, run, and build dependencies, as well as a
    canonical hash of package recipes. Previously, hashes only included link
    and run dependencies (though build dependencies were stored by
    environments). We coarsened the hash to reduce churn in user installations,
    but the new default concretizer behavior mitigates this concern and gets us
    reuse and provenance.  You will be able to see the build dependencies of
    new installations
  * concretizer:unify:when_possible will try to resolve a fully unified
    environment, but if it cannot, it will create multiple configurations of
    some packages where it has to.  with spack find.
  * Spack now has an updated binary format, with improvements for security. The
    new format has a detached signature file, and Spack verifies the signature
    before untarring or decompressing the binary package. The previous format
    embedded the signature in a tar file, which required the client to run tar
    before verifying (#30750). Spack can still install from build caches using
    the old format, but we encourage users to switch to the new format going
    forward.
  * The spack bootstrap mirror command can automatically create a mirror for
    bootstrapping the concretizer and other needed dependencies in an
    air-gapped environment.
  * spack env depfile can be used to generate a Makefile from an environment,
    which can be used to build packages the environment in parallel on a single
    node
  * In addition to being conditional themselves, variants can now have
    conditional values that are only possible for certain configurations of a
    package.
- removed following patches as incorporated upstream:
  * fix-tumbleweed-naming.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  8 14:55:34 UTC 2021 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to version 0.17.0
  (Upstream feature/bug references (<ID>) are relative to
   https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/<ID>).
  * New concretizer is now default
    The new concretizer introduced as an experimental feature in v0.16.0
    is now the default (#25502). The new concretizer is based on the
    clingo logic programming system,
    and it enables us to do much higher quality and faster dependency solving
    The old concretizer is still available via the concretizer: original
    setting, but it is deprecated and will be removed in v0.18.0.
  * Binary Bootstrapping
    To make it easier to use the new concretizer and binary packages,
    Spack now bootstraps clingo and GnuPG from public binaries. If it
    is not able to bootstrap them from binaries, it installs them from
    source code. With these changes, you should still be able to clone Spack
    and start using it almost immediately.
  * Reuse existing packages (experimental)
    The most wanted feature from our
    2020 user survey and
    the most wanted Spack feature of all time (#25310). spack install,
    spack spec, and spack concretize now have a --reuse option, which
    causes Spack to minimize the number of rebuilds it does. The --reuse
    option will try to find existing installations and binary packages locally
    and in registered mirrors, and will prefer to use them over building new
    versions. This will allow users to build from source far less than in
    prior versions of Spack. This feature will continue to be improved, with
    configuration options and better CLI expected in v0.17.1. It will become
    the default concretization mode in v0.18.0.
  * Better error messages
    We have improved the error messages generated by the new concretizer by
    using unsatisfiable cores. Spack will now print a summary of the types
    of constraints that were violated to make a spec unsatisfiable (#26719).
  * Conditional variants
    Variants can now have a when="<spec>" clause, allowing them to be
    conditional based on the version or other attributes of a package (#24858).
  * Git commit versions
    In an environment and on the command-line, you can now provide a full,
    40-character git commit as a version for any package with a top-level
    git URL. e.g., spack install hdf5@45bb27f58240a8da7ebb4efc821a1a964d7712a8.
    Spack will compare the commit to tags in the git repository to understand
    what versions it is ahead of or behind.
  * Override local config and cache directories
    You can now set SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG to disable the ~/.spack and
    /etc/spack configuration scopes. SPACK_USER_CACHE_PATH allows you to
    move caches out of ~/.spack, as well (#27022, #26735). This addresses
    common problems where users could not isolate CI environments from local
    configuration.
  * Improvements to Spack Containerize
    For added reproducibility, you can now pin the Spack version used by
    spack containerize (#21910). The container build will only build
    with the Spack version pinned at build recipe creation instead of the
    latest Spack version.
  * New commands for dealing with tags
    The spack tags command allows you to list tags on packages (#26136), and you
    can list tests and filter tags with spack test list (#26842).
  * Copy and relocate environment views as stand-alone installations (#24832)
  * spack diff command can diff two installed specs (#22283, #25169)
  * spack -c <config> can set one-off config parameters on CLI (#22251)
  * spack load --list is an alias for spack find --loaded (#27184)
  * spack gpg can export private key with --secret (#22557)
  * spack style automatically bootstraps dependencies (#24819)
  * spack style --fix automatically invokes isort (#24071)
  * build dependencies can be installed from build caches with --include-build-deps (#19955)
  * spack audit command for checking package constraints (#23053)
  * spack can now fetch from CVS repositories (yep, really) (#23212)
  * spack monitor lets you upload analysis about installations to a
  * spack monitor server (#23804, #24321, #23777, #25928))
  * spack python --path shows which python Spack is using (#22006)
  * spack env activate --temp can create temporary environments (#25388)
  * --preferred and --latest options for spack checksum (#25830)
  * SPACK_PYTHON environment variable sets which python spack uses (#21222)
  * SPACK_SKIP_MODULES lets you source setup-env.sh faster if you don't need modules (#24545)
