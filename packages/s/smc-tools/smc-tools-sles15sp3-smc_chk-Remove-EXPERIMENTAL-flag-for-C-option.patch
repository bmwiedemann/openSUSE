Subject: [PATCH 1/2] smc_chk: Remove 'EXPERIMENTAL' flag for '-C' option

The 'EXPERIMENTAL' portion could be irritating to users of option '-C' -
this functionality is ready for prime time. However, the same code is
also called by one of the undocumented _experimental_ features, and
it makes sense in that context.
