  <title>smc-tools - Shared Memory Communication tools</title>
  <description>Shared Memory Communication via RDMA (SMC) is a socket over RDMA communication protocol that allows existing TCP socket applications to transparently benefit from RDMA when exchanging data over an RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) network.

The tools provided in this package allow existing TCP applications to use a RoCE network without needing to make changes in them.</description>
