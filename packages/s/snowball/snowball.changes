- Updated to version 3.0.1:
  + The __init__.py in 3.0.0 was incorrectly generated due to a
    missing build dependency and the list of algorithms was empty,
    (gh#snowballstem/snowball#229, gh#snowballstem/snowball#230
    and gh#snowballstem/snowball#231).
  + Add trove classifiers for Armenian and Yiddish which have now
    been registered with PyPI, (gh#snowballstem/snowball#228).
- Changes from version 3.0.0:
  + Numerous bug fixes and improvements, see full details in
    /usr/share/doc/packages/snowball/NEWS.
- Rebase build-options.diff, python-dist.diff and
  shared-library.diff.
- Spec file clean up and add patch attributions.

- Update to version 2.2.0:
  + New code generator: Ada generator.
  + Javascript: Fix generated code to use integer division rather
    than floating point division.
  + Python:
    - Python 2 is no longer actively supported.
    - Fix code generated for division.  Previously the Python code
      we generated used integer division but rounded negative
      fractions towards negative infinity rather than zero under
      Python 2, and under Python 3 used floating point division.
  + For more information, see shipped NEWS file.
- Rebase build-options.diff and shared-library.diff.
- Bump libstemmer.so.0d to libstemmer.so.1d: we have no guarantee
  that upstreams static-only-library maintains any kind of ABI.
