%description
SpanDSP is a library of DSP functions for telephony, in the 8000 sample
per second world of E1s, T1s, and higher order PCM channels. It
contains low level functions, such as basic filters. It also contains
higher level functions, such as cadenced supervisory tone detection,
and a complete software FAX machine.
