- update to 1.8.1:
 * Fixed libbsd feature test confusion. Rationale: users expressed confusion
   when using the old "--without-libbsd" configure flag. Some assumed that it
   compiles scrot without libbsd, but it only made the build script error if
   libbsd is a dependency. This is useful to package maintainers: it gives them
   a yes/no answer on whether the library is a dependency on their system. The
   old configure flag has been replaced by a more verbose
   "--enable-libbsd-feature-test".
 * Fixed 'make dist', adding some files to bootstrapped tarballs.
