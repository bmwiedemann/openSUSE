- Update to 0.15.13:
  Work on v0.16 is well underway including finally refactoring
  the internal module layout for languages, frames, fonts, font
  managers, and much more. But in the meantime less dramatic (and
  less disruptive) improvements have accumulated.
  @Omikhleia has touched up CSL support and added support for
  position tracking. @turtlegarden sent in some updates to
  Norwegian localization. I fixed up some handling of unset
  settings, kept reloading modules from re-registering commands,
  and sped up development cycles by enabling a debug mode that
  skips time consuming build time optimizations.
  - New Features
    - packages: Add position tracking for bibliography citations
      (5930a0c)
    - packages: Support the position condition in CSL engine
      (0c732a2)
  - Bug Fixes
    - build: Pass --enable-debug through to Cargo to actually get
      a debug-enabled binary (443551a)
    - fonts: Properly account for settings allowed to be nil
      (792518e)
    - languages: Update Bokmål messages (a10e0f4)
    - languages: Update Nynorsk messages (4ec6654)
    - packages: Add missing boolean coercion for strip-periods in
      CSL engine (5af2842)
    - packages: Always apply punctuation-in-quotes in CSL
      citations (689c8e2)
    - packages: Fine-tune CSL post-rendered cleaning hacks
      (487f3f0)
    - packages: Fix package reload to not call for command
      reregistration unless asked (41846f7)
- Update to 0.15.12:
  The last release went out with really obnoxious inverted logic
  for a deprecation message that spammed the terminal warning
  users when their usage of various modules was correct and up to
  date and not when they were using a deprecated interface. This
  just puts the noise to rest.
  - Bug Fixes
    - utilities: Correct reversed deprecation warning condition
      (a97c679), closes #2265
- Update to 0.15.12:
  This release isn’t ground breaking, but it is line breaking. A
  major bug in our hyphenation algorithm went undetected for a
  long time because (by a virtue of a bug canceling out a bug)
  it didn’t happen to affect English or Turkish—far and away the
  most utilized languages in SILE’s history. But it did affect
  French, where @Omikhleia found and squashed it. Hyphenation
  minima settings should be properly set for many other languages
  now and follow the current language. Several languages also got
  hyphenation pattern updates.
  In other minor details, length and measurement types no longer
  silently 'succeeds' when asked to parse non-compliant input.
  Additionally disabling the (default on) variablespaces setting
  will actually take effect now and not continue to use any of
  the related settings in some contexts.
  - New Features
    - cli: Include deps file itself as output target so it gets
      remade (696aafe)
    - languages: Update hyphenation patterns for Bulgarian
      (e1bd96e)
    - languages: Update hyphenation patterns for el/grc (e5e30d6)
    - languages: Update hyphenation patterns for Portuguese
      (1298af4)
    - languages: Update hyphenation patterns for Spanish
      (cf289b6)
    - languages: Update hyphenation patterns for Thai (4abed66)
    - packages: Add revert for space handling bug fix to
      retrograde (951e47e)
  - Bug Fixes
    - cli: Correctly output makedeps files from the Rust CLI the
      same as from Lua (42a879a)
    - cli: Pass current binary name of Rust wrapper through for
      errors and make-deps (62820ce)
    - core: Error on excess unparsable input on measurements and
      lengths (#2260) (4d33389)
    - hyphenators: Correctly apply hyphenation minima, isolate
      per language (6143d54)
    - languages: Set proper hyphenation minima for Esperanto
      (a014353)
    - outputters: Update cairo backend to work with current API
      (13bd9d4)
    - shapers: Actually disable variablespaces if setting set to
      false (a6628b5)
    - shapers: Update pango shaper to work with current API
      (541cb8d)
- Update to 0.15.10:
  This release brings yet another layer of improvements
  contributed by @Omikhleia, especially to the bibliography
  and indexing features. The bibliography system now uses CSL
  (Citation Style Language) by default, with enhanced support
  for grouped citations via \cites, better name formatting, and
  improved style compliance. The indexer received significant
  upgrades including page range collapsing, customizable styling
  hooks, flexible placement in documents, and language-aware
  sorting. Font handling saw improvements with new ex-height
  and cap-height adjustments, particularly benefiting code and
  verbatim text display.
  The CLI also gained a new argument to streamline the process
  of loading 3rd party modules. SILE has always found packages
  in specific system or relative locations easily, but setting
  the path to custom LuaRocks trees was not trivial. A new
  --luarocks-tree argument should make it much simpler to match
  however you install with .
  Other notable changes include avoiding hyphenation prior to
  page breaks, and fixes for various language-specific issues
  including Uyghur hyphenation and UTF-16 handling. Warning
  messages involving unsupported languages should also make more
  sense and not spam the terminal over and over.
  - New Features
    - build: Add tooling to generate tarball of vendored crates
      (55be5cd)
    - cli: Add argument to ease soarch for 3rd party module(s)
      (4f0d5a4)

      cited (f828e9b)

      range collapsing (e272e43)
    - packages: Add new styling hooks to the indexer (facf84c)
    - packages: Add option for filler between item and page in
      indexer (691bfe2)
    - packages: Allow indexes to be used anywhere in a document
      (808aaf4)
    - packages: Honor bibliography style indentation rules

    - packages: Use the CSL implementation by default for
      bibliographies (d3c352b)

      typesetter (6af4934)
    - typesetters: Discourage page breaks after hyphenated lines
      (ba49c8c)
  - Bug Fixes

      composed of many glyphs (2b109a0)
    - typesetters: Special punctuation spaces need better italic
      correction (448ab15)
- Update to 0.15.9:
  This release actually fixes build issues for macOS (Darwin)
  we tried to fix in v0.15.8 but were more involved than first
  suspected. It also packages some CSL files that were missing
  from previous source distributions and touches up a few other
  odds and ends.
  In non-build related changes, @Omikhleia patched up some
  bibliography behavior. As a cherry on top I patched up the
  ability to generate a completely blank PDF without throwing an
  error and changed the outputter API to include an official way
  to throw an error without also generating a blank PDF.
  - New Features
    - outputters: Add a method to handle empty PDFs vs. cleanup
      after error (5a7694d)

      built from source tarballs (15a18c0)
    - packages: CSL subsequent-author-substitute is optional
      (680df8c)
- Update to 0.15.8:
  This release fixes build issues for macOS (Darwin) we
  introduced back in v0.15.6 that have been holding back releases
  on Homebrew and Nix's Darwin support. In addition to the build
  su- pport, the macfonts font loader has been tweaked to support
  fallback to fontconfig when a font is not found so it will
  behave more similarly to Linux builds.
  On all platforms, CLI output is a bit cleaner. Many runtime
  errors now output cleaner message formatting instead of a
  jumble of joined lines. Also some error chains where one error
  would trigger another have been resolved.
  The math support continues to be refined by @Omikhleia, this
  release bringing a few new commands and features, better
  behavior parity with MathML, and a couple bug fixes.
  - New Features
