  * Minor fix of 'EVP_CipherFinal_ex'.
  * Fix build with cppunit.
  * Export PKCS#11 symbols from the library.

  * Change access mode bits for /var/lib/softhsm/tokens/
    to 1777. All users can now create tokens, but only access their own.

    token objects are deleted, the user PIN is removed and the token
    label is updated.
  * Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.
  * Calling C_GetSlotList with NULL_PTR will make sure that
    there is always a slot with an uninitialized token available.
  * The token serial number will be used when setting the slot

  * Update the command utils to use the token label or serial
    to find the token and its slot number.
