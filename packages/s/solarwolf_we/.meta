  <title>Action/arcade game originally based of SolarFox on the Atari 2600, Widescreen Edition</title>
  <description>Do you belong to the fans of the game Solarwolf and have switched
to a widescreen monitor like I did?
Have you ever missed the widescreen support in this great game?
Well, you are at the right place then. Here it is!
I proudly present to you the ultimate widescreen edition of Solarwolf 1.5!
It supports 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios.
The original game in 4:3 aspect ratio is included in this special edition.
Upgrade today and enjoy plenty of new levels and all of the old enemies.
This work is based on Solarwolf 1.5 written by Pete Shinners

The point of this game is to scramble through 48 levels of patterns,
collecting all the boxes. The part that makes it tricky is avoiding the
relentless hailstorm of fire coming at you from all directions.</description>
