  <title>Static multicast routing for UNIX</title>
  <description>SMCRoute is a UNIX/Linux tool to manage and monitor multicast routes.
It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routing.

SMCRoute can be used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers like
mrouted or pimd in setups where static multicast routes should be
maintained and/or no proper IGMP or MLD signaling exists.

Multicast routes exist in the UNIX kernel as long as a multicast routing
daemon runs. On Linux, multiple multicast routers can run simultaneously
using different multicast routing tables.
