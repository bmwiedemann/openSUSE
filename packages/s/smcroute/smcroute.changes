Sun Nov 21 08:48:26 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.5
  Fixes
  * Parse error in /etc/smcroute.conf. SMCRoute fails to start on
    interfaces with mrdisc disabled, when built with mrdisc
    support and -N passed on command line.
- Update to version 2.5.4
  Fixes
  * Avoid trying to delete inactive VIFs. Fixing an annoying bogus
    error: "Failed deleting VIF for iface lo: Resource temporarily
    unavailable".
  * Too small string buffer for IPv6 address causing garbled output
    in periodic expiry callback.
  * Fix too small buffer for IPv6 address in mroute display
    functions.

Wed Nov 17 10:19:17 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Added patch(es):
  * harden_smcroute.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 23 20:32:44 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.3
  Changes
  * New tests to verify add/del of IPv4/IPv6 routes in kernel MFC.
  Fixes
  * Fix #166: build warning with gcc 10.2.1: "comparison is always
    true due to limited range of data type".
  * Fix build warning with --disable-mrdisc configure option.
  * Fix #167: cannot remove routes added with smcroutectl add,
    only affects add/del at runtime with smcroutectl, not .conf
    reload.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 16:26:10 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.2
  Changes
  * Allow installing routes with no outbound interfaces.
  * Reinitialize VIFs on reload in case of new interfaces.
  * Handle cases when interfaces change ifindex, i.e. they've first
    been * removed and then re-added with the same name.
  Fixes
  * Fix VIF leak when deleting interfaces with MRDISC enabled.
  * Fix handling when an (S,G) moves to another IIF. This fixes
    issues where the SMCRoute kernel cache was out of sync with
    the kernel MFC.
  * Fix handling of lost/disabled interfaces at reload. This fixes
    a couple of issues where routes were not updated properly at
    runtime.
  * Update interface flags on reload, this fixes issues when
    SMCRoute failed to detect interfaces that had their MULTICAST
    flag set or cleared at runtime.
  * Skip setsockopt() for IPC sockets. This fixes warnings in
    syslog about failing to disable MULTICAST_LOOP and
    MULTICAST_ALL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 22 08:42:23 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.1
  Changes
  * Add .sha256 checksum to dist files, useful for packagers
  Fixes
  * systemd Notify integration, restore NotifyAccess=main
  * ftbfs on older compilers, e.g. gcc 4.8.3, use -std=gnu99
  * Fix Documentation refs in systemd unit file, new man pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 20 13:59:17 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5.0
  * Fully automated test suite with 15 tests covering many use
    cases.
  * Support for /etc/smcroute.d/*.conf .
  * Support for applying changes to .conf files without disturbing
    established flows -- i.e., seamless addition or removal of
    outbound interfaces in existing rules, or add/remove routes,
    without ever affecting other routes.
  * Support for route replacement/update smcroutectl.
  * Full (*,G) wildcard route matching, for IPv4 and IPv6.
  * Variant wildcard route matching with source and group range
    matching. This may of course waste a lot of resources, so
    handle with care:
    + (*,G/LEN), issue #135 (IPv4), and issue #162 (IPv6)
    + (S/LEN,G), issue #81
    + (S/LEN,G/LEN)
  * Full SSM/ASM group join support, for both IPv4 and IPv6.
    Including joining group ranges from both smcroutectl and
    .conf .
  * New command line option, -F file.conf to verify file syntax.
  * The -I NAME command line option has changed to -i NAME,
    compat support for the previous option remains.
  * The mrdisc flag to the phyint directive is now what solely
    controls the functionality per interface. Previously a
    mechanism to enable/disable the functionality (if enabled) if
    active routes were in place. However, this did not cover (*,G)
    routes so that has been removed to simplify and guarantee full
    function.
  * Output format from smcroutectl has been extensively changed.
    E.g, new /LEN support means wider columns, but heading have
    also changed.
  Fixes
  * Fix #120: failed ASM/SSM IGMP join if interface has no address
  * Fix #130: dynamic IPv6 routes are not flushed (like IPv4 (*,G))
  * Fix #149: (*,G) cache timeout callback stops, or never starts
  * Fix #151: same log entries
  * Fix #156: smcruotectl show does not show IPv6 routes
  * Fix stochastic timer behavior, e.g. mrdisc announcements
    experienced interference with the (*,G) cache timer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 09:18:48 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.4.4
  Changes
  * Allow same outbound interface as inbound for routes, only warn user
  * systemd unit file hardening, recommended by Debian
  Fixes
  * IGMP header checksum missing from mrdisc frames
  * Unblock *all* matching, and currently blocked, (S,G) to a
    newly installed (*,G) route, only the first know was unblocked
  * Timer nanosecond bug causing loss of address refresh on DHCP
    interfaces.  Interface monitoring feature introduced in v2.4.3
  * Calling init script with `stop` does not stop `smcrouted`
  * ifindex in UNIX/POSIX is an interger, not unsigned short

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 14 13:02:17 UTC 2018 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Remove ip_route.h for the license clash

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 10 17:51:15 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 2.4.3
  Changes
  * Add strlcat() replacement from OpenBSD, use instead of strcat()
  * smcrouted should never log to system console, proposed by Westermo
  Fixes
  * smcrouted fails to join multicast groups on interfaces that do not
    yet have an IP address when smcrouted starts up, or when it receives
    SIGHUP, e.g. DHCP client interfaces. This patch release adds a timer
    refresh of interface addresses that retries multicast group joins
    until an address is set. This is similar to issue #55, but does not
    handle interfaces that do not exist yet.
  * Make sure Linux alias interfaces (baseif:num) are registered as
    baseif. Westermo found that use of alias interfaces cause multiple
    VIFs to be registered for the same base interface causing multicast
    routes to use the wrong inbound or outbound VIF. Alias interfaces
    use the same underlying physical interface so only one VIF needed.
  * Fix display of route counters and column alignment
  * Simplify utimensat() replacement, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW unused

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 10 20:09:44 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 2.4.2
  Changes
  * Add wrapper script smcroute for use with old style startup scripts
  * Add symlinks to man pages for smcrouted.8 and smcroutectl.8
  * Update SysV init script, daemon now called smcrouted
  Fixes
  * Fix #96: A .conf line may be missing final newline, this is fine
  * Spellcheck smcroute.conf example

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 18 12:56:38 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de
