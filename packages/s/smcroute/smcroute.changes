  * systemd unit file hardening, recommended by Debian
  Fixes
  * IGMP header checksum missing from mrdisc frames

- Update to version 2.4.3
  Changes
  * Add strlcat() replacement from OpenBSD, use instead of strcat()
  * smcrouted should never log to system console, proposed by Westermo
  Fixes
  * smcrouted fails to join multicast groups on interfaces that do not
    yet have an IP address when smcrouted starts up, or when it receives
    SIGHUP, e.g. DHCP client interfaces. This patch release adds a timer
    refresh of interface addresses that retries multicast group joins
    until an address is set. This is similar to issue #55, but does not
    handle interfaces that do not exist yet.
  * Make sure Linux alias interfaces (baseif:num) are registered as
    baseif. Westermo found that use of alias interfaces cause multiple
    VIFs to be registered for the same base interface causing multicast
    routes to use the wrong inbound or outbound VIF. Alias interfaces
    use the same underlying physical interface so only one VIF needed.
  * Fix display of route counters and column alignment
  * Simplify utimensat() replacement, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW unused

- Update to version 2.4.2
  Changes
  * Add wrapper script smcroute for use with old style startup scripts

  * Update SysV init script, daemon now called smcrouted
  Fixes
  * Fix #96: A .conf line may be missing final newline, this is fine
  * Spellcheck smcroute.conf example
