%description
screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash
script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme
information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots
nowadays. It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII
version of that distribution's logo and some valuable information to the
right. There are options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a
screenshot upon displaying info, and even customizing the screenshot
command! This script is very easy to add to and can be easily extended.
