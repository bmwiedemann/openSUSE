- SIEGE-3.0.9 – This release is intended to bring siege into the
  21st Century. It fixes lots of compiler warnings which are thrown
  by more recent versions of gcc. While it contains no sexy new
  features, you should probably upgrade to this version.

- SIEGE-3.0.8 – This release adds the port number to a redirect URL
  on the condition that request is made to a non-standard port. It
  also adds the location of the log file on logging errors. This
  should make it easier for users to correct their problem. “Oh,
  look, it’s trying to log to a location that doesn’t exist.”

- SIEGE-3.0.7 This release fixes a bug introduced in siege-3.0.6.
  Rather than strictly adhere to the RFC, siege will construct an
  absolute URL from a relative one. While this is convenient it
  missed a usecase. Siege-3.0.6 barfs on Location: http://localhost
  All siege 3.0.6 users should upgrade to 3.0.7.

- SIEGE-3.0.6 With this release, siege changes the way it handles
  –reps=once. It now divides a urls.txt file evenly among all its
  users, and each URL in the file is hit exactly once. This release
  also includes several fixes and a documentation update.

- SIEGE-3.0.5 This release addresses another inconsistency between
  the HTTP standard and practice. While RFC 2616 allows a port
  designation in the Host header, it confuses too many
  implementations for Siege to continue to send it. This version
  also fixes several significant bugs. All Siege users should
  update to this version.

- SIEGE-3.0.4 Although RFC 2616 specifies that Location directives
  must contain an absolute URI, most Web clients normalize relative
  URIs. This release adds conventional compliance with relative URI
  handling. Ironically, it also includes a new default user-agent
  so that field is in compliance with RFC 2616.

Mon Aug 19 22:09:13 UTC 2013 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 3.0.3:
  * adds URL escaping: reserved characters are %-encoded as per RFC 3986
  * numerous bugfixes such as improved variable evaluation in the urls.txt
    file, dynamic Accept-Encoding, improved siegerc parsing, and several memory
    fixes
  * fixes a siegerc parser bug which was inadvertently introduced in the 3.0.x
    line: in those versions, siege ignores entries with leading whitespace
  * adds URL escaping along with an option to turn the feature off
  * removes chunked encoding from -g/--get requests to make the output more
    human-readable

- changes from 3.0.2:
  * bugfix release
  * corrects a significant problem with POSTs in version 3.0.1
  * all 3.0.1 users should upgrade to this version.

  * provides a new method for looping through a URLs file: each client now
    begins at a different location in the file
  * provides support for long URLs and POST data
  * includes several bugfixes and documentation updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    at configure time
- changes from 2.72b1:
  * fixes a 13-year bug: Siege now uses $sysconfdir/urls.txt as its default
    urls.txt file; this is in accordance with existing documentation
- cumulative changes from 2.71 and its betas:
  * adds the option of timestamping each output line while in verbose mode
