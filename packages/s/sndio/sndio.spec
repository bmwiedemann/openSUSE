%description
It provides an lightweight audio & MIDI server and a fully documented
user-space API to access either the server or directly the hardware in
a uniform way. Sndio is designed to work for desktop applications, but
pays special attention to synchronization mechanisms and reliability
required by music applications. Reliability through simplicity are part
of the project goals.
