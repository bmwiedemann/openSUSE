# zfcp_host_configure
#
# Copyright (c) 2017 SUSE LINUX GmbH, Nuernberg, Germany.
#
# Configures a zfcp host adapter by calling the IBM-provided chzdev command.
# Whereas this script used to validate the parameters provided to it,
# we now rely on chzdev to do that instead. The script is intended only
# as a "translation layer" to provide backward compatability for older
# scripts and tools that invoke it.
#
#
# Usage:
#   zfcp_host_configure <ccwid> <online>
#
#	ccwid = x.y.ssss where
#		x is always 0 until IBM creates something that uses that number
#		y is the logical channel subsystem (lcss) number. Most often
#                 this is 0, but it could be non-zero
#		ssss is the four digit subchannel address of the device, in
#                    hexidecimal, with leading zeros.
#	online = 0 to take the device offline
#		 1 to bring the device online
#
# Return codes
#   Return codes are determined by the chzdev command.
