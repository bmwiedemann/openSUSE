.SH NAME
mkdump \- Preparing disks for use as S/390 dump device.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkdump
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIDEVICE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
mkdump 2.0.3
.PP
Prepare one or more volumes for use as S/390 dump device. Supported devices
are ECKD DASD and SCSI over zFCP disks, while multi\-volumes are limited to DASD.
.PP
Only whole disks can be used, no partitions! If the device is incompatible
formatted/partioned, the script will refuse to install the dump record
unless the \fB\-\-force\fR switch is given.
.PP
Disks which are in use or have mounted partitions will not be listed and can't be used.
The mentioning of "dumpdevice" after a disk indicates that it is an already usable dump device. Additionally multi\-volume dump devices are indicated by the list of including DASD ids.
