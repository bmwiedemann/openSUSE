Subject: [PATCH] dasdfmt: retry BIODASDINFO if device is busy

Modern udev have the wonderful 'feature' to sending a 'change'
event whenever a device opened with O_RDWR is closed again.
The reasoning is that the said program _might_ have changed
the partition table and hence we _might_ have missed a partition
update.
But in doing so it not only generated tons of pointless events
but also confused the hell out of other programs.
Idiots.
