 .SH DESCRIPTION

-with a master key of an IBM cryptographic adapter in CCA coprocessor mode.

+Use the \fBzkey\fP tool to generate and manage secure AES keys that are
+enciphered with a master key of an IBM cryptographic adapter in CCA coprocessor
+mode. You can also use the \fBzkey\fP tool to validate and re-encipher secure
 AES keys.
 .PP
+The secure keys can either be stored in a file in the file system, or
+in the secure key repository. The default location of the secure key repository
+is \fB/etc/zkey/repository\fP. Set environment variable \fBZKEY_REPOSITORY\fP
+to point to a different location to use a different secure key repository
+location. Keys stored in a secure key repository inherit the permissions from
+the repository directory (except write access for other users, which is always
+denied). The default repository location \fB/etc/zkey/repository\fP is created
+with group \fBzkeyadm\fP as owner and mode \fB770\fP. Thus all secure keys
+created in that repository are owned by group \fBzkeyadm\fP. Anyone that
+is supposed to access secure keys in the secure key repository must be part of
+group \fBzkeyadm\fP.
+.PP
+When storing the secure key in a key repository, additional information, such as
+a textual description of the key, can be associated with a secure key.
+You can associate a secure key with one or multiple cryptographic adapters
+(APQNs) that are set up with the same CCA master key.
+You can also associate a secure key with one or multiple volumes
+(block devices), which are encrypted using dm-crypt with the secure key. The
+volume association also contains the device-mapper name, separated by a colon,
+used with dm-crypt. A specific volume can only be associated with one secure
+key.
+.PP
 The generated secure key is saved in a file with a size of 64 or 128 bytes.
-The file contains an AES key of 128, 192, or 256 bits enciphered with the
-master key of the CCA cryptographic adapter.
+The file contains an AES key with a length of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The key is

+.SH COMMANDS
+The \fBzkey\fP tool can operate in two modes. When argument
+.I secure\-key\-file
+is specified then it operates on the secure key contained in the specified file.
+This applies to commands \fBgenerate\fP, \fBvalidate\fP, and \fBreencipher\fP.
+When the

+option is specified then it operates on a secure key contained in the secure

 key was generated.
+.PP
+The generated secure key can either be stored in a file in the file system,
