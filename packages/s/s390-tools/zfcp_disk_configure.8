.SH NAME
zfcp_disk_configure \- Configures or deconfigures a zfcp-attached SCSI Logical Unit (LU).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zfcp_disk_configure ccwid wwpn lun online
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zfcp_disk_configure
is intended to make it easy to persistently add and remove zfcp-attached SCSI Logical Units. In addition to bringing the LU online or offline, it will also create or delete the necessary udev rules for the LU.
.SH PARAMETERS
.IP ccwid
The device number of the zFCP adapter. Takes the form x.y.ssss where
.RS
.B x
is always 0 until IBM creates something that uses that number.
.RE
.RS
.B y
is the subchannel set ID (SSID). Most often this is 0, but it could be non-zero.
.RE
.RS
.B ssss
is the four digit device address of the subchannel, in hexidecimal, with leading zeros. If entered in upper/mixed case, this is automatically converted to lower case.
.RE
.IP wwpn
Is the World Wide Port Number of the storage array in which the LUN resides. This will be a 16 digit hexidecimal number of the form 0x0123456789abcdef. You must obtain this number from the administrator of the storage array.
.IP lun
Is the Logical Unit Number of the specific disk in the storage array. This will also be a 16 digit hexidecimal number of the form 0x0123456789abcdef. You must obtain this number from the administrator of the storage array. Be careful in that some storage array administrator interfaces disply the LUN in decimal, and must be converted to hexidecimal to be used in this command.
.IP online
Either a literal 1 to attach the LU or a literal 0 to detach the LU.
.SH FILES
Please see the documentation of
.B chzdev.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DEBUG
If set to "yes" some minimal debugging information is output during execution.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

.B chzdev.
.SH BUGS
Gotta be some, I'm sure. If you find one, please open a bug report.
