# The dasd_diag_mod kernel module will not function properly
# unless the dasd_fba_mod module is also loaded. However,
# there are no cross-module symbol dependencies that would
# cause and entry to be placed in
# /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep 
# So, we're adding this "soft" dependency here to make sure that
# any time dasd_diag_mod gets loaded, so will dasd_fba_mod.
#
# Additionally, DASD devices that are supposed to be used in
# DIAG250 mode will have problems because as far as the kernel
# is concerned, and hence udev, the driver is dasd_fba_mod. So,
# we need to also have the reverse dependency so that when
# dasd_fba_mod gets loaded, so will dasd_diag_mod. This will
# prevent problems that would show up in the system log as:
# Setting the DASD online failed because of missing DIAG discipline
#
softdep dasd_diag_mod pre: dasd_fba_mod
softdep dasd_fba_mod pre: dasd_diag_mod
