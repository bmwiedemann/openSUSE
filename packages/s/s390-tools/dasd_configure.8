.TH dasd_configure "8" "February 2013" "s390-tools"
.SH NAME
dasd_configure \- Configures or deconfigures a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dasd_configure [-f -t dasd_type ] ccwid online [use_diag]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dasd_configure
is intended to make it easy to persistently add and remove DASD volumes. In addition to bringing the volume online or offline, it will also create or delete the necessary udev rules for the volume.
.SH PARAMETERS
.IP -f
Force creation of udev rules, do not check values in /sys.
.IP -t
Must be either dasd-eckd or dasd-fba. Must be provided if -f is used.
.IP ccwid
The device number of the DASD volume. Takes the form x.y.ssss where
.RS
.B x
is always 0 until IBM creates something that uses that number.
.RE
.RS
.B y
is the subchannel set ID (SSID). Most often this is 0, but it could be non-zero.
.RE
.RS
.B ssss
is the four digit device address of the subchannel, in hexidecimal, with leading zeros. If entered in upper/mixed case, this is automatically converted to lower case.
.RE
.IP online
Either a literal 1 to bring the volume online or a literal 0 to take it offline
.RE
.IP use_diag
Either a literal 1 to use the DIAG driver for this device, or a literal 0 to use the "normal" driver.
.RE
.SH FILES
Please see the documentation of
.B chzdev.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DEBUG
If set to "yes" some minimal debugging information is output during execution.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Messages and return codes are determined by the
.B chzdev
command.
Except for:
.IP
.B Device ${CCW_CHAN_ID} is unformatted
.RS
The DASD volume was brought online, but it has not been formatted with dasdfmt. This condition is really only important for YaST to determine if it should prompt the user to decide if they want to format it or not at that point. Return code 8 is set.
.RE

If environment variable DEBUG is set to "yes," it shows the command line of the invoked
.B chzdev.
Additionally, the following messages may be issued on stdout:
.IP
.B DASD ${CCW_CHAN_ID} did not come online.
.RS
The DASD volume did not come online within the waiting time. Could not check if the DASD is formatted (see above). Return code 17 is set.
.RE
.SH BUGS
Gotta be some, I'm sure. If you find one, please open a bug report.
