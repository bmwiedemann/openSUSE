- Update to version 1.8.4
  * Updated man page (doc/sopwith.6) to match Debian's manual page.
  * Bring Sopwith up to date with bug fixes provided by Fedora.
    This should avoid crash on start-up problems and makes
    compiling more robust.
- Changes from version 1.8.3
  * The function asynclos() in swasynio.c includes a parameter
    which is never used. Calling functions do not bother passing
    a parameter. To avoid undefined behaviour the definition of
    aynclos() has been fixed. (bdo#748172)
  * Updated manual page to provide current default keys and
    mention the location of the custom keys file (~/.sopwith/keys)
  * Removed stray object files from tarball.
  * Added rule to makefile "tarball" which performs more
    complete clean-up and makes tarball in parent directory.
- Changes from version 1.8.2
  * Added SDL_CFLAGS flag to src/Makefile to bring us
    in line with FreeBSD patches.
  * Updated copyright notice on help screen.
  * Removed compiler optimiations to avoid crashes when game is
    built using versions of GCC newer than 4.6.
- Changes from version 1.8.1
  * Corrected initialization error would would prevent sound
    from playing at start-up.
  * Updated documentation to include command line flags for
   playing music (-p) and starting Sopwith in quiet mode (-q).
- Changes from version 1.8.0
  * Most distributions are moving to GTK-3, sopwith's legacy code uses
    GTK-2. Dropping GTK support in favour of SDL.
  * Modified configure script.
  * Patched crash caused by failure to find a suitable video device.
  * Modified src/sdl/video.c to add new check.
  * Fixed configure warings related to datarootdir variable.
- Changes from version 1.7.5
  * Cleaned up code to avoid compile warnings. Sopwith now
    builds cleanly using Clang 3.0 and GCC 4.6.
  * Added custom keys option. Controls can be altered by
    adjusting the values in the ~/.sopwith/keys file. On
    Windows this file should be located in the user's profile
    under "AppData/Local/.sopwith/keys".
- Changes from version 1.7.4
  * Added man page patch to update documentation.
  * Added include statements in vid_vga.c and sdl/video.c to bring
    us in line with Debian's patches.
  * Applied patch to swasynio.c to correct spelling errors.
  * Oil tank explosions should be a little more intense now. These
    larger/faster explosions can be turned off at the command line
    by using the "-e" flag. (bdo#188298.)
- Changes from version 1.7.3
  * Added range check patch to avoid crashes when plan or missile 
   is close to the edge of the map. (bdo#224518 and bdo#258751)
  * Mouse pointer no longer appears over Sopwith window.
    (bdo#187930)
  * Depreciated gtk branch, updated configure/makefile scripts.
  * Sound is now turned off by default. Sound can be turned on using
    the -p flag from the command line.
  * Fixed socket check in tcpcomm.c (error returns -1, not less than -2).
  * When AI plane is chasing the player's plane, the AI plane will
    now shoot if it is in position. (swauto.c)
  * When the player's plane is damaged, the auto-pilot is less
    manouverable, just like the player's controls. (swauto.c)
  * Holding down the X or Z keys now causes the player's plane to
    constantly speed up or slow down. Previously, the key had
    to be rapidly tapped to change speed. (bdo#188301)
  * Updated title screen to show exit message.
  * Fixed compiler warning in swconf.c
- Changes from version 1.7.2
  * Cleaned up some compile errors from gcc 4.4.1 on Ubuntu.
    (bdo#582399)
  * Added -g command line option. -g and a number, such as -g2
    will start the game on difficulty level 2. Normally the
    game starts at zero. (bdo#582398)
