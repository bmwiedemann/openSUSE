Mon Nov 11 19:49:52 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to 2.7.0
  * Some tanks were changed to face in the opposite direction
    where it made more sense, as a minor visual improvement.
  * A document was added that describes the project's philosophy.
  * The Emscripten version now has an option on the main menu to
    open the manual.
  Bug fixes:
  * Custom missions can now be used in network games.
  * A minor visual bug was fixed where objects appeared to be
    overlapping with the ground sometimes.
  * A bug was fixed where targets could sometimes blow themselves
    up with their own bullets (most notably the hangars by
    shooting their own flags).
  Custom mission files:
  * New target types: water towers, radio towers and observation
    balloons. You can load new_targets.sop to see them.
  * Replacement graphics no longer need to be the same size as
    the graphics they are replacing.
  * It is now possible to have target graphics that are larger
    than 16x16 pixels. The new radio and water tower targets
    provide examples of this.
  * The original.sop mission file now includes the original
    graphics and title music, to make it easier for people to 
    make quick mods.
  * The "owner" field in mission files was renamed to "faction".
    Objects are allied to factions, rather than belonging to
    planes. The manual page documents how the factions system
    works.

Sat Nov  9 12:55:55 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to 2.6.0
  * The autopilot logic has been improved to avoid crashing the
    plane into the ground at low altitudes. This fixes a bug that
    made landing the plane almost impossible at higher game levels
    where the plane flies much faster.
  * A palette was added to simulate the Atari version of the game
    (according to the source code, anyway; it's not clear the Atari
    version was ever completed).
  * Planes are now shown on the menu, to give a feel for what the
    game will look like when choosing a palette.
  * The manual page was improved, including to add "bugs" and
    "examples" sections.
  * A minor tweak was made to one of the plane sprites to fix a
    one-pixel hole in the plane.
  * There is now a -v option that shows the program version number.
  * An AppStream metainfo file was added.
  Some nice new features for modders:
  * There's a new manpage that documents the format of Sopwith
    mission files.
  * Four new target types (truck, tanker truck, flag and tent) have
    been added for use in fan-made levels. There are also ten slots
    for custom user-defined target types, if you want to create
    your own completely new ground targets.
  * It is now possible to replace symbols (sprites) inside custom
    map files. An example file is included that changes the
    biplanes into triplanes, so it's finally possible now to face
    off against "The Red Baron" in his triplane!
  * It's now possible to replace the title screen music in custom
    map files too.
- Use pkg-config style dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 22 17:19:22 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 2.5.0:
  * There is still no editor for making custom levels, but a Python library 
    has been added for programmatically generating levels. 
    An example level has been included, the first custom level!
  * Objects in custom levels can now be arbitrarily mirrored and rotated.
  * The numeric keypad enter key can now be used to switch into fullscreen mode, 
    and also when entering a hostname (thanks TechKnight).
  * A long-standing bug was fixed where the computer planes would try to take off 
    by flying straight up and then immediately stalling.
  * The score is no longer reset between levels (this was a bug).
  * At end of level, the remaining planes now "tick down" properly.
  * A bug was fixed where the app icon was shown as a black silhouette.
  * The manual page now documents the dashboard layout.
  * The score will no longer be drawn over the medals for very large values.

- added GPG signature verification

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 10:12:22 UTC 2024 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 2.4.0:
  * There is now an emscripten (web) version, available on the website.
  * It is now possible to make and load custom levels (there is no proper 
    level editor available yet though).
  * There are now a number of alternative palettes that can be used that 
    simulate different CGA palettes and old monitors (thanks techknight).
  * There are now hotkeys to end or restart the current game (thanks techknight).
  * There is now a -p command line option to specify TCP port number.
  * Sound is now oversampled to reduce sound aliasing (thanks @kmill).
  * Starting level is now synchronized between players at multiplayer start.
  * A bug was fixed with the keybindings menu not working (thanks ranguli, NY00123)
  * An input bug was fixed where a backspace would leave some visual corruption, 
    and the cursor now blinks.
  * A bug was fixed where the same medal could be awarded twice.
  * Timing of music on the title screen was fixed (thanks @NY00123).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 16 09:25:59 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 2.3.0:
  * Medals are no longer cleared after a crash. 
  * The purple heart medal is now only awarded to players injured in combat. 
  * The close button now quits the game (thanks Will Thompson)
  * The help screen is no longer shown when aborting the game.

- Update to 2.2.0:
  * Help text is now shown for new players. This is shown on game start in
    novice mode, but won't be shown again after a successful flight. 
  * It's no longer possible to flip the plane upside down while sitting
    motionless on the runway (a bug since the original DOS versions).
  * It's no longer possible to get wounded on the ground. 
  * The game no longer freezes up in multiplayer mode if the other player quits.
  * If the game quits with an error, a friendly dialog box now shows the error.
  * Some minor manpage fixes
  * Lots more internal cleanups 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  5 14:59:47 UTC 2022 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.1.1:
  * An embarrassing bug was fixed where you could win by bombing your own
  buildings.
  * The ox "splat" screen now shows correctly if you are shot down and crash
  into an ox.
  * Bug fixes and changes in this version:
  * libm is included as a dependency when needed (thanks slicer69).
  * No error is printed if the config file doesn't exist (thanks Kenneth
  Pronovici).
  * The screen is now redrawn properly when in menus and the window is
    uncovered
  or resized (thanks Kenneth Pronovici).
  * Some potential crashes were fixed when near the edges of the map.
  * Some of the code has been refactored to centralize how levels are
    defined. In
  the future this will help to support custom levels.
  * Documentation changes:
  * Build instructions were clarified (thanks Kenneth Pronovici).
  * Better documentation of novice mode was added to the manpage (thanks
    Kenneth
  Pronovici).
  * References to the -p argument were removed from the manpage and the help
    text
  (thanks Kenneth Pronovici).
  * Changes in this version:
  * Sound has been reenabled. Sound output is now passed through a bandpass
  filter intended to make it sound like a real PC speaker, and also plays
  back at a much quieter volume, to be less startling to new players.
  * Medals are now awarded to reward players (thanks creichen). The Unix
  manpage includes some details about the medals and how to attain them.
  * There is now a configuration screen for setting key bindings, which are
  stored in the same configuration file as other settings.
  * Thanks to SDL2's renderer API, the game now scales up to arbitrary
    window
  sizes and resolutions, and isn't limited to just 320x200 or 640x400.
  * Network performance has been improved significantly.
  * The Unix manpage has been significantly improved and expanded. A
    separate
  manpage was added for the configuration file.
  * Sopwith now runs on macOS, and Mac .dmg packages are generated.
  * Also now builds and runs cleanly on Haiku.
  * The Windows .exe now has metadata and an icon.
  * The missiles feature was changed to a hidden setting since it's not very
  fun and doesn't really fit the game's theme.
  * The networking option to use a "TCP loop" has now been merged with the
  normal "connect" option, for simplicity. The target server may be a real
  server or a TCP loop server, and the clients will autodiscover.
  * Movement precision within the game was made significantly more precise.
  This fixes a long-standing issue where fractional movement values were
  just being discarded, instead of being included in calculations as they
  should have been.
  * Fix computer planes not shooting when tailing the player's plane
    (creichen).
  * Fix planes crashing into their own bullets (creichen).
  * Fix players able to turn quickly when wounded and using the autopilot.
  * Damaged ground no longer remains on the title screen after the game
    ends.
  * Network games no longer desync when only one player uses harry keys
    mode.
  * Big oil tank explosions now match the magnitude of the old explosions
    from
  Sopwith 1 and Sopwith 2. The command line option to disable them has been
  replaced with a configuration variable.
  * A bug was fixed where it was possible to stop the plane in midair when
  playing the game in novice mode (thanks Alaux).
  * Code has been ported to SDL2.
  * Rewritten graphics code
  * Major internal restructuring: removal of obsolete code, removal of
  some global variables
  * Sopwith configuration file is no longer ~/.sopwithrc on \*nix systems,
    but
  can now be found at ~/.local/share/SDL\ Sopwith/sopwith.cfg
- drop sopwith-fix-string-include.patch, sopwith-gpl.diff: obsolete

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 16:08:38 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.8.4
  * Updated man page (doc/sopwith.6) to match Debian's manual page.

    This should avoid crash on start-up problems and makes
    compiling more robust.
- Changes from version 1.8.3
  * The function asynclos() in swasynio.c includes a parameter
    which is never used. Calling functions do not bother passing
    a parameter. To avoid undefined behaviour the definition of
    aynclos() has been fixed. (bdo#748172)
  * Updated manual page to provide current default keys and
    mention the location of the custom keys file (~/.sopwith/keys)
  * Removed stray object files from tarball.
  * Added rule to makefile "tarball" which performs more
    complete clean-up and makes tarball in parent directory.
- Changes from version 1.8.2
  * Added SDL_CFLAGS flag to src/Makefile to bring us
    in line with FreeBSD patches.
  * Updated copyright notice on help screen.
  * Removed compiler optimiations to avoid crashes when game is
    built using versions of GCC newer than 4.6.
- Changes from version 1.8.1
  * Corrected initialization error would would prevent sound
    from playing at start-up.
  * Updated documentation to include command line flags for
   playing music (-p) and starting Sopwith in quiet mode (-q).
- Changes from version 1.8.0
  * Most distributions are moving to GTK-3, sopwith's legacy code uses
    GTK-2. Dropping GTK support in favour of SDL.
  * Modified configure script.

  * Modified src/sdl/video.c to add new check.
  * Fixed configure warings related to datarootdir variable.
- Changes from version 1.7.5
  * Cleaned up code to avoid compile warnings. Sopwith now
    builds cleanly using Clang 3.0 and GCC 4.6.
  * Added custom keys option. Controls can be altered by
    adjusting the values in the ~/.sopwith/keys file. On
    Windows this file should be located in the user's profile
    under "AppData/Local/.sopwith/keys".
- Changes from version 1.7.4
  * Added man page patch to update documentation.
  * Added include statements in vid_vga.c and sdl/video.c to bring
    us in line with Debian's patches.
  * Applied patch to swasynio.c to correct spelling errors.
  * Oil tank explosions should be a little more intense now. These
    larger/faster explosions can be turned off at the command line
    by using the "-e" flag. (bdo#188298.)
- Changes from version 1.7.3
  * Added range check patch to avoid crashes when plan or missile 
   is close to the edge of the map. (bdo#224518 and bdo#258751)

    the -p flag from the command line.
  * Fixed socket check in tcpcomm.c (error returns -1, not less than -2).
  * When AI plane is chasing the player's plane, the AI plane will
    now shoot if it is in position. (swauto.c)
  * When the player's plane is damaged, the auto-pilot is less
    manouverable, just like the player's controls. (swauto.c)
  * Holding down the X or Z keys now causes the player's plane to
    constantly speed up or slow down. Previously, the key had
    to be rapidly tapped to change speed. (bdo#188301)
  * Updated title screen to show exit message.
  * Fixed compiler warning in swconf.c
- Changes from version 1.7.2
  * Cleaned up some compile errors from gcc 4.4.1 on Ubuntu.
    (bdo#582399)
  * Added -g command line option. -g and a number, such as -g2
