  <title>stand-alone freedesktop.org system tray</title>
  <description>Stalonetray is a stand-alone freedesktop.org and KDE system tray (notification
area) for X Window System/X11 (e.g. X.Org or XFree 86). It has full XEMBED
support and minimal dependencies: an X11 lib only. Stalonetray works with
virtually any EWMH-compliant window manager.
