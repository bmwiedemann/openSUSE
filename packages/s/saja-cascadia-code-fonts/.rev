    <comment>- Update to version 2008.25
  * We've temporarily stopped shipping variable OTFs due to some
    concerns about overlapping and psautohint
  * The heaviest weight of Cascadia has been made a little lighter
  * We have aligned the Powerline glyphs and the box-/line-drawing
    glyphs better to their metrics and to the letter glyphs
  * Diacritic anchors have been added to all alphabetic characters (#282, #330)
  * The font now ships with decomposed fi and fl ligatures
  * The horn combining diacritic has had its weight fixed somewhat for Bold
  * Primes have been redesigned to give them a more &quot;angled&quot; feel (#294)
  * Acute and grave have been given additional weight to help
    differentiate them from dot (#268)
  * The contextual alternate for x used to signify hexadecimal
    numbers has been disabled (#285)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 2009.14
  * Cascadia now has support for the Salishan languages of the
    Pacific Northwest and other coastal scripts!
  * We've fixed an issue in the -&lt;&lt; ligature that caused it to
    overlap itself at certain font weights (#355)
  * We remastered mark positioning for glyphs with existing
    diacritics for improved design for letters with multiple
    diacritics above
  * We have implemented a workaround for a freetype rendering
    issue that resulted in chunky rendering for certain glyphs
    (#350)
