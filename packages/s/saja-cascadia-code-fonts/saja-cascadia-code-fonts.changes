- Update to version 2008.25
  * We've temporarily stopped shipping variable OTFs due to some
    concerns about overlapping and psautohint
  * The heaviest weight of Cascadia has been made a little lighter
  * We have aligned the Powerline glyphs and the box-/line-drawing
    glyphs better to their metrics and to the letter glyphs
  * Diacritic anchors have been added to all alphabetic characters (#282, #330)
  * The font now ships with decomposed fi and fl ligatures
  * The horn combining diacritic has had its weight fixed somewhat for Bold
  * Primes have been redesigned to give them a more "angled" feel (#294)
  * Acute and grave have been given additional weight to help
    differentiate them from dot (#268)
  * The contextual alternate for x used to signify hexadecimal
    numbers has been disabled (#285)
