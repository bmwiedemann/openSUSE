Subject: [PATCH] Use a Find module to find older Coin versions.

We want to use a SoQt snapshot to replace the Qt4 dependency but keep the current stable Coin version.
As the current Coin version doesn't provide a CMake config file, we'll use a FindCoin.cmake module.

+# FindCoin
+# ---------
+#
+# Try to find the Coin library.
+# This module is temporary and only meant to find older Coin versions when using
+# GIT snapshots for SoQt.
+#
+# This will define the following variables:
+#
+# ``Coin_FOUND``
+#     Coin was found.
+#
+# ``Coin_VERSION``
+#     The version of Coin.
+#
+# ``Coin_INCLUDE_DIRS``
+#     This should be passed to target_include_directories() if
+#     the target is not used for linking.
+#
+# ``Coin_LIBRARIES``
+#     The Coin library.
+#     This can be passed to target_link_libraries() instead of
+#     the ``Coin::Coin`` target
+#
+# If ``Coin_FOUND`` is TRUE, the following imported target
+# will be available:
+#
+# ``Coin::Coin``
+#     The Coin library
