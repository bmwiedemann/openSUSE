%description
The core rendering library Coin is a multiplatform high-level 3D graphics
library with a C++ API. Coin uses OpenGL for accelerated rendering, while
providing a higher abstraction level, 3D interactivity, and many complex
optimization features for fast rendering that are transparent for the
application programmer, thus facilitating the development of interactive 3D
applications and greatly increasing productivity.

%description devel
By using the combination of Coin, Qt and SoQt for your 3D applications, you
have a framework for writing completely portable software across the whole range
of UNIX, Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. Coin, Qt and
SoQt makes this possible from a 100% common codebase, which means there is a
minimum of hassle for developers when working on multiplatform software, with
the resulting large gains in productivity.
