  <description>The core rendering library Coin is a multiplatform high-level 3D graphics
library with a C++ API. Coin uses OpenGL for accelerated rendering, while
providing a higher abstraction level, 3D interactivity, and many complex
optimization features for fast rendering that are transparent for the
application programmer, thus facilitating the development of interactive 3D
applications and greatly increasing productivity.</description>
