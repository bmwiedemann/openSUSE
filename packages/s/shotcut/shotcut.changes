Wed Oct 30 08:40:10 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 24.10.29:
  Speech to Text:
  * Shotcut gets its first AI based on OpenAI’s Whisper, courtesy
    of the whisper.cpp project. This is available through Subtitles >
    Speech to Text menu item or button
  * Our builds include a basic model that has decent speed and accuracy
    but not a big size. (You can think of the model as the brain.)
  * You can download a bigger and better better brain (model) in ggml
    format and configure it in the Speech to Text dialog, but it will be slower.
  * The dialog creates two jobs that appear in the Jobs panel: one to
    export audio and another to convert to text.
  * The results are added to the Subtitles panel as a new top-level Subtitle Track.
  * Currently, the only GPU our build supports is Apple Silicon.
    Otherwise, it is heavily multi-threaded on the CPU.
  * Known quirk: subtitle items sometimes start earlier than expected.
    Timing is provided by the model and tool, and we lack the skills and resources to improve this.
  * Expect there to be occasional errors. Like humans and non-ideal
    conditions, it is not perfect. We will not take action on bug reports
    about some piece of audio not converting to the expected text.
  * OpenAI has made some warnings about the usage of their Whisper models:
    In particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken
    without their consent…. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where
    flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.
  Transition Improvements:
  * Ripple Delete a transition restores the entirety of the clips included in the transition.
  * Lift (non-ripple delete) a transition no longer leaves a gap; the gap is filled with the adjacent clips.
  * Moving an adjacent clip away increases the transition duration instead of detaching and leaving a gap.
  Other Improvements:
  * Removed the Export > Video > Resample button. Now, there are simply ignorable inline warnings when making
  certain changes.
  * Added File > Show Project in Folder to menu.
  * Added a decimals <number> option to numeric keywords in the GPS Text video filter.
  * Changed Recent Projects to Projects: items in this view no longer disappear as Recent reaches its maximum
  length and old items are removed.
  * Added a Remove action to the context menu in Projects.
  * Hide the Reframe video filter and button if GPU Effects is on.
  * Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.1.
  Fixes:
  * Fixed a crash doing when doing more than one Playlist > menu > Add Selected to Slideshow. In theory, this
  could fix other random crashes in Timeline.
  * Fixed a crash opening a project containing a subtitle track with no items.
  * Fixed odd value for computed width in Reframe output video filter causes export to fail.
  * Fixed Reframe visual control can create odd-valued dimensions.
  * Fixed AVCHD video frame rate is double (could fix other formats).
  * Fixed making a proxy video for a iPhone 16 Pro video containing spatial audio.
  * Fixed GPU filters paste below non-GPU filters.
  * Fixed Slideshow Generator dialog is too tall with vertical video mode.
  * Fixed GPS Offset would reset in GPS Text video filter.
  * Fixed the maximum allowed Time in the Time Remap filter to prevent white frames.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 16 10:53:58 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 24.09.13:
  This is a quick followup release to version 24.08 that introduced a few major new bugs:
  * Fixed seeking and frozen video with some files or scenarios.
  * Fixed Reverb audio filter missing on Windows.
  * Fixed wrong frame rate for Android Camera videos.
  Other Fixes:
  * Fixed some issues with Timeline > Clip > Apply Copied Filters.

    You can also use Ctrl with the mouse wheel.
  * Added a Reframe video filter (Output only) and Export > Video > Reframe button.
  * Added Export > Video > Resample with warning dialog to enable the oft-misused export video resolution, aspect
  ratio, and frame rate fields.
  * Added a warning dialog when changing Settings > Video Mode or Timeline > Output > Edit with a project open.
  * Upgraded MLT to version 7.28.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 14:08:03 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 24.08.29:
  * Added View > Subtitles.
  * Added Subtitle Burn In video filter (only works on Output track).
  * Added a Power (W) ( #gps_power#) field to the GPS Text video filter.
  * Now Enter or Return in Filters > search changes focus to the search results.
  * Now Up or Down in Help > Actions and Shortcuts > search changes focus to the search results.
  * Changed the Softness to 0 in the Obscure With Blur and Obscure With Mosaic filter sets.
  * Fixed the Linux portable, AppImage, and Snap fail to launch on some systems
    (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04) with Qt 6 and Wayland.
  * Fixed occasional audio pop/click with some media files especially with uncompressed audio.
  * Fixed lag in Filters > search.
  * Fixed a disabled Crop: Circle or Crop: Rectangle video filter becomes enabled when reselected.
  * Fixed the hevc_toolbox hardware video encoder fails detection on some Intel Macs.
  * Fixed file dialogs open slowly in the Linux AppImage.
  * Fixed overriding Properties > Rotation on a proxy video whose default is not 0 exports with wrong rotation.
    This bug affected the creation of the proxy and thus requires making a new proxy, which is easier said than
    done on Windows due to file locking. Properties > Proxy > Disable Proxy on the affected clips is a workaround
    if you do not turn off proxy completely.
  * Fixed Properties > Proxy > Make Proxy does not override a DJI- or GoPro-provided proxy video.
  * Fixed 59.94 fps in Matroska falsely identified as variable frame rate (broke in v24.06).
  * Fixed mono audio assets not playing through both stereo channels (broken in v24.06).
  * Fixed Open Other > Audio/Video Device > Video Input on macOS (broke in v24.06).
  * Fixed spinboxes on Settings > Theme > System on Windows takes too much
    space from the numeric field (broke in v24.06).
  * Fixed many audio filters missing for Windows on Arm computers (broke in v24.06).
  * Fixed setting the audio language in Export > Other using alang=.
  * Fixed right Alt key (AltGr) for text input in some languages instead keyboard shortcuts/actions in Windows.
  * Fixed the Convert dialog when dropping hangs Windows Explorer until the dialog is closed.
  * Fixed Add Keyframe at Playhead for some filters, for example Color Grading.
  * Fixed enabling keyframes in Color Grading adds 2 keyframes.
  * Fixed the modal font dialog on Linux can be behind main window making Shotcut not responsive.
  * Upgraded MLT to version 7.26.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 05:31:50 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 24.06.26:
  * Added SVT-AV1 encoder (faster non-hardware AV1 encoder).
  * Added support for AVIF (AV1) images.
  * Added a Drop Shadow video filter that uses the input alpha channel.
    This means that it will not work as expected when used after a text
    filter on a video clip; rather, you must use a text clip on an upper track.
  * Added a Vibrance video filter. This is similar to Saturation, but
    Vibrance is sensitive to the current saturation instead of adjusting
    all values equally as in saturation. This is especially helpful to
    prevent affecting skin tones.
  * Added the Mid-Side Matrix audio filter for processing these kinds of
    microphones into proper stereo sound.
  * Added Keyframes > Scrub While Dragging.
  * Added Playlist > menu > Columns.
  * Added support for DJI LRF (MP4) files as a proxy.
  * Improved handling for some variable frame rate videos. Now,
    Properties tries to show the file’s target frame rate and extends
    the variable detection logic to include strange average frame rate
    values (what previous versions showed in Properties).
  * Changed Playlist Tiles view mode to show Date instead of In/Start.
  * Fixed using graphics (text, image, etc.) on upper video track with GPU Effects.
  * Fixed an off-by-one frame bug in the duration for Glaxnimate animations.
  * Fixed Undo does not work for time filters.
  * Fixed spamming (Undo) History when using the timeline fade controls.
  * Fixed preview color with GPU Effecs is inaccurate.
  * Fixed Timeline > Select None does not clear the Filters panel or VUI.
  * Fixed single click does not reset a multi-selection.
  * Fixed Export > Codec > Quality hint not updated after changing Rate control.
  * Fixed Properties > Proxy > Make does not regenerate if already exists.
  * Fixed changing Properties (except Speed) affects clips on other
    tracks with Ripple All Tracks turned on.
  * Fixed drag from Source and drop to Source changes Playlist.
  * Fixed Automatically Add Tracks changes the current video track, which
    can cause unexpected behavior with Properties > Speed change, for example.
  * Fixed files generated automatically in the project folder (.stab, .rawr, etc.)
    are incorrectly generated in the app data’s autosave folder in the app
    session immediately after Shotcut recovers an auto-saved project.
  * Fixed changing Properties can delete a timeline clip.
  * Fixed selected filter changes unexpectedly by changing tabs or clicking filter categories.
  * Fixed Properties > Audio > Track > All.
  * Fixed the project folder when running an autosave-recovered session.
  * Fixed Settings > Timeline > Auto Add Tracks creates too many tracks when drop multiple clips to Timeline.
  * Fixed new Settings > Time Format not used in several places.
  * Fixed View > Application Log > Previous not working after the first time.
  * Fixed Properties > menu > View Bitrate hiding the first second.

    changing Keyframes (work in progress) for the following filters:
    + Fade In Audio
    + Fade Out Audio
    + Gain / Volume
    + Brightness
    + Color Grading
    + Contrast
    + Fade In Video
    + Fade Out Video
    + Text: Rich
    + Size, Position & Rotate
    + White Balance
  * Added Apply Copied Filters to Timeline > menu > Edit and context
    menu that works with multiple selected clips.
  * Upgraded MLT to version 7.24.0.
  Fixes:
  * Fixed crash if the Keyframes panel is in a tab group along with Filters.
  * Fixed Elastic Scale video filter can distort with preview scaling.
  * Fixed dropping incompatible video file may not prompt conversion.

  * Improved selection in Timeline after various operations.
  * Improved behavior changing Properties > Speed with Timeline > Ripple on.
  * Improved the speed of opening a timeline project.
  * Fixed Filters > + > Sets adds audio filters in reverse order (broke in v24.01).
  * Fixed Properties > Convert HLG HDR to to Rec. 709 SDR is not tone-mapping (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed distortion caused by Mixdown audio filter.

- Update to 24.01.28:
  * Added Player > Loop (\) and Player > Set Loop Range to the menu and player controls.
  * Added Timeline > Selection > Group/Ungroup (Ctrl+G, command+G on macOS). This is basically a saved
    multi-selection system. So, the operations it supports are all those available for multiple selection. That
    does not include trim, Filters, or Properties at this time. Hold Alt (option on macOS) to
		select an individual member of a group. Hold Alt+Ctrl (option+command on macOS) to
		multi-select only certain members of a group.
  * Added support for multiple selection to Split At Playhead.
  * Added Timeline > Edit > Split All Tracks At Playhead (Shift+S).
  * Added Edit > Undo and Redo support for adding, removing, changing, and disabling Filters.
  * Added Timeline > Edit > Nudge Forward (.) and Nudge Backward (,).
  * Added Pause and Resume to the context menu in Jobs.
  * Added Settings > Backup with options for:
      * Manually
      * Hourly
      * Daily (default)
      * Weekly This creates a backup of the current project file in a manner similar to File > Backup and Save
      except it is automatic now unless Manually is chosen.
  * Added File > Other Versions submenu that tries to find similarly-named project files in the same folder
    create by Shotcut backup or recovery mechanisms.
  * Added Settings > Player > Audio API on Linux and Windows. Basically, this makes the --SDL_AUDIODRIVER command
    line option available in the Settings menu.
  * Added a Previous button to View > Application Log dialog that goes to the log file created by the previous
    app session. Now, on startup, Shotcut makes a backup of shotcut-log.txt to shotcut-log.bak.
  * Added a Copy button to all text viewer dialogs that does the same thing that the non-obvious Select All and
    Copy actions in the context menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 19 09:34:56 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 23.12.15:
  * Fixed crash on start on Wayland on Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10 -
    may require installing qt6-wayland (broke in v23.11).
    This breaks support for Wayland on Ubuntu 23.04, which is a less
    important version than the other two. The combination of Wayland and
    Qt 6 seems impossible to handle universally in the portable/AppImage/Snap binary
    bundle. If installing a Qt 6 Wayland package does not work in your distro,
    some options are to login using an X session instead of Wayland or try the Flatpak.
  * Fixed numerous audio filters missing on macOS/Intel (broke in v23.11).
  * Fixed crash in No Sync video filter with new Ease Back and Ease Elastic keyframes.
  * Fixed Equalizer: Parametric > Preset not loading (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed Slideshow Generator not padding videos on mismatching aspect ratio (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed Timeline waveform is not updated when changing Properties > Audio > Track.
  * Fixed #filename# and #basename# keywords in Text: Simple video filter with non-ASCII filenames on Windows.
  * Fixed Properties > View Bitrate opens too big on high DPI screen.
  * Fixed Properties > View Bitrate > Save image is not anti-aliased.
  * Fixed Properties > Measure Video Quality accuracy when Color range is Full.
  * Fixed some minor memory leaks.
  * Changed all NVENC hardware encoders in Export to use CQ instead of constant QP for VBR rate control.
  * Ugraded FFmpeg to version 6.1
  * Upgraded AV1 decoder dav1d to version 1.4 and AV1 encoder libaom-av1 to version 3.8.0
  * Upgraded rubberband audio pitch library to version 3.3.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  2 20:33:36 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 23.11.29:
  Improvements:
  * Added Crop:Rectangle > Apply to Source button. This button is only enabled when the aspect ratio of the
  source media matches your project’s Video Mode because it is impossible to include the black padding that
  Shotcut adds to a source. This feature is the primary way to simply “crop a video.” You do not need to use the
  timeline for this. You can simply:
     1. set Settings > Video Mode to Automatic,
     2. open a video file,
     3. add the Crop: Rectangle video filter,
     4. adjust the rectangle control in the player,
     5. click Apply to Source in the Filters panel,
     6. choose Yes in the dialog asking to change the Video Mode, and
     7. Export.
  * Added Opacity to GPS Text, Text: Simple, and Timer filters.
  * Improved performance of Timeline > Zoom.
  * Added rectangular selection to Timeline.
  * Added Settings > Timeline > Rectangle Select.
    This is on by default, and scrubbing with the mouse on the timeline requires clicking near the play head.
    When this is on, hold Shift to turn it off temporarily. When this is off, hold Shift to temporarily turn it
    on.
  * Changed the Smooth keyframe type to avoid overshoots and cusps.
    This only applies to new projects made with this and future versions. Thus, the behavior of smooth keyframes
    made with an earlier version remains the same for compatibility reasons.
  * Added Ease In, Ease Out, and Ease In/Out to Keyframes.
    This also changes the appearance of keyframes in the timeline view of Keyframes to make it more clear where
    the behavior applies - between keyframes. Remember this: when thinking about “in” or “out”, for Shotcut “in”
    refers to the beginning of something - a clip, filter, or parameter between keyframes. And “out” refers to
    the end of something. So, this is not easing into a keyframe and easing out of a keyframe. Rather, it is
    easing into or out of the change/segment/span/tween of a parameter between keyframes.
  * Added Properties > View Bitrate….
    If you have ever used the classic Bitrate Viewer for Windows and frustrated with the lack of updates or not
    available on your current OS, here you go.
  * Added a Track Auto Fade Video filter. This can only be added to tracks and makes a dip to black or other
    color or fade in and out opacity for overlays to each clip.
  * Changed Export > Codec and Audio to disable some options when a lossless-only or an intra-only codec is
    selected.
  * Added Settings > Timeline > Automatically Add Tracks.
    The defaults for this is off because adding tracks increases memory usage. Also, it does not automatically
    add a track if nothing is in the Timeline as the timeline is optional in Shotcut. Also, it does not
    automatically add a track when you open a project with no empty tracks. It only adds tracks when you add
    something to the timeline or move a clip between tracks.
  * Added a button in Filters to save a filter set and change the Copy checked filters button to not show a
    dialog.
  * Added Filters > Set > Glow Intensity.
    This demonstrates how you can mix a filtered output with the input to reduce it. Also, change the Mask: From
    File > Treshold to do a side-by-side comparison with and without the filter.
  * Added Split at Playhead back into the timeline clip context menu.
  * Changed the Save option in the low memory dialog to perform a backup and save to prevent breaking projects.
  * Added support for av1_nvenc NVIDIA AV1 hardware encoder on Windows and Linux.
  * Upgraded MLT to version 7.22.0.
  New Bugs:
  * Fixed honoring the “Do not show this anymore” checkbox in the Convert to Edit-friendly dialog (configuration
  key showConvertClipDialog) (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed the new batch convert dialog (View > Resources) appeared instead of the old Convert to Edit-friendly
  one when dragging a single concerning clip to Playlist or Timeline (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed Motion Tracker filters are forgotten upon switching to Source player (broke in v23.09).
  * Fixed Mask: Simple Shape > Softness not working on macOS (broke in v23.05).
  * Fixed saving a favorite for Filters > + > Sets.
  * Fixed Timeline appears all white on Qt 6.6.
  * Fixed libvpx security vulnerability CVE-2023-5217.
  * Fixed libwebp security vulnerability CVE-2023-4863.
  Old Bugs:
  * Fixed Text: Simple > #createdate# keyword deletes preceding text.
  * Fixed a crash when opening View > Scopes > Audio Loudness.
  * Fixed marker at start of the next clip was deleted when using Timeline > Edit > Ripple Trim Clip Out.
  * Fixed Properties > Transition changes were lost when Undo after trimming a clip’s out point on the Timeline.
  * Fixed a crash when Undo after trimming a transition that resulted in a new transition. With this fix Shotcut
    no longer permits creating a new transition within the same mouse drag that removes a transition.
  * Fixed AMD (AMF) quality options in a saved Export preset shows up in the Other tab overriding Codec >
    Quality.
  * Fixed YouTube export preset is not H.264 high profile with some hardware encoders.
  * Fixed a memory leak when using YADIF deinterlacers.
  * Fixed color of export from still images when using full range and pix_fmt=yuv444p.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 31 06:34:04 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 23.07.29:
  * Fixed crash on startup on older Windows 10 computers that do not have Direct3D 11
  (broke in v23.05).
  * Fixed Timeline scrubbing and skimming accelerate too much (broke in v23.06).
  * Fixed Stabilize analysis jobs not working on a speed-adjusted timeline clip (broke in
  v23.05).
  * Fixed the visibility of the cursor in the Text: Rich filter’s editor (broke in
  v23.05).
  * Fixed the up and down cursor keys not working in some numeric fields (broke in
  v23.05).
  * Fixed seeking on the new Speed: Forward Only and Speed: Forward & Reverse filters.
  * Fixed the buttons in the Delete Filter Set confirm dialog are hidden if the name is
  long.
  * Fixed the color level of RGB and RGBA sources (e.g. images) with GPU Effects.
  * Fixed crash adding a GPU filter to Timeline > Output by not showing GPU filters for
  that selection.
  * Fixed shift-drag-drop from Windows Explorer to Playlist deletes the files! This is an
  old bug, and Shotcut is not deleting the files. But it accepts a move drop action for
  the purpose of reordering playlist items. However, doing so with a list of filenames
  makes Windows assume the receiving application did something appropriate with thes file
  and then… delete them on behalf of the app just to be sure?!? Smooth move. (Another
  Windows file manager Directory Opus does not exhibit this bad behavior.)
  * Fixed another very old bug on Windows where sound does not follow the default output
  device, for example plugging headphones, until you restart the app. Please note that if
  you are using Settings > Audio Channels > 6 (5.1) after the default sound output
  changes, you will likely experience distortion in the audio playback until you restart
  the app.
  * Added the --SDL_AUDIODRIVER command line option for Windows and Linux.
  * Fixed appending to Playlist from clipboard with nothing yet opened in the Source
  player.
  * Fixed the Export > Audio > Quality range for the aac codec.
  * Fixed trying to drag a keyframe vertically may snap changing its horizontal position.
  * Fixed clicking OK in a color dialog on Windows without changing anything resets the
  alpha to 255.
  * Fixed top-field-first interlaced output.
  * Added Track Auto Fade and Track Seam audio filters. These filters address an old
  problem where clicks and pops may be heard in export when switching between clips due
  to discontinuities in the audio stream. A recommended technique was to add a 2 frame
  Fade Audio Out and Fade Audio in filters on clips. Track Auto Fade automates that.
  Track Seam works on a similar level but rather attempts to do a smoothing between
  outgoing and incoming samples around edit points. Both of these new filters may ONLY be
  added to individual tracks—audio or video.
  * Added Transition type > Cut to the Slideshow Generator.
  * Added Ctrl+Wheel (command on macOS) to numeric fields to increment and decrement by a
  larger amount.
  * Updated Qt libraries to version 6.4.3.
  * Updated libebur128 to version 1.2.6.
  * Updated rubberband library to version 3.2.1.
  * Updated MLT to version 7.18.0.

  * Fixed Properties > Copy Fill File Path uses incorrect directory separator on Windows.
  * Fixed chroma bleeding on some (e.g. Ut Video) interlaced 4:2:0 files.
  Improvements:
  * Improved the smoothness of fast forward (up to 64x) playback.
  * Improved Timeline performance and automatic scrolling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 18:56:50 UTC 2020 - Pavol Cupka <palica@liguros.net>

- Update to release version 20.02.17
- Upstream changes:
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed dropping multiple files to Playlist in a new project (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed some broken keyboard shortcuts in the Turkish translation.
    - Fixed Properties > Speed not working after a project file repair.
    - Fixed clip selection after Insert Track or Remove Track.
    - Fixed Playlist > Add Selected to Timeline creates corrupt clips (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed Settings > Display Method > Software (Mesa) on Windows (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed creating a Project folder with leading or trailing spaces.
    - Fixed saving the length property in MLT XML as a time value independent of frame rate.
    - Fixed starting Text: Simple video filter with "@" shows "0".
    - Fixed seeking previous & next on the first track in Keyframes where you trim a filter or use simple keyframes.
    - Fixed an unexpected transition is created when moving a clip rightward adjacent to the next clip in Timeline (regression in v19.12.16).
    - Fixed drag-n-drop from Source player to Timeline left player in an inconsistent state (broken in v19.09.14).
    - Fixed an inconsistent colorspace conversion when accessing a cached image.
    - Fixed Playlist > Copy followed by a change in Properties incorrectly changes the playlist item.
    - Fixed clicking on the rectangle control may change its size.
    - Fixed using the LUT (3D) filter with file with extended characters in its file path on Windows.
    - Fixed a crash when using a transition on every track at the same time.
  - Changes:
    - Improved the reliability of Timeline > Select None.
    - Changed Timeline > Master > Properties > Frame rate to show 6 decimal digits.
    - Reduced the latency of scrubbing (regression in v19.12.31).
    - Changed the video-overlay rectangle control used in some filters to allow changing the position by dragging from anywhere inside the rectangle.
    - To enable, one must first double-click the center circle to put it into a positioning-locked mode. Otherwise, you would be prevented from dragging the clip out of the Source player.
    - Changed the Filters panel on macOS to prevent floating to avoid a frequently reported problem of the Filters window appearing blank/black.
    - Changed Timeline > clip context menu > Detach Audio to not seek afterwards.
    - Improved mouse wheel and trackpad behavior in Timeline.
    - Now, you do not need to ensure the mouse pointer is over a clip, speed is reduced, and zoom keeps focal point in view. The new zoom behavior does not apply when using the option Center the Playhead in the timeline menu.
    - Upgraded MLT to version 6.20.0 and WebVfx to version 1.2.0.
  - New:
    - Added Settings > Preview Scaling!
      This reduces the resolution for rendering effects for preview within the app, but there may be added a fair cost to the CPU for down-scaling sources to the preview resolution. Thus, this will be more beneficial when low resolution proxies are created, which is planned for version 20.04 in April.
      Please understand that preview scaling will not always provide perfect fidelity. Some differences are unavoidable especially where blur, softness, and noise are concerned.
      Some filters may not support preview scaling and will process at full project resolution:
          Choppy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 00:29:55 UTC 2019 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- Update to release version 19.08.16
- Upstream changes:
  *Changed Playlist > Open As Clip to simply Open. This action now opens the playlist item directly in the Source player, and all changes made in Source (trim in/out), Properties, Filters, and Keyframes apply to the playlist item immediately without an explicit update.
  *Added Playlist > Copy that opens a copy of the playlist item in Source just like the old behavior. This is useful if you want to trim out another shot from the same source clip or create a different sub-clip with different filtering.
  *Changed double-click on a playlist item to Open the clip instead of Copy it.
  *Added keyboard shortcut Shift+C to Copy a playlist item.
  *Now, when you drag a clip from Playlist to Timeline the timeline shows an appropriately-size box on a track.
  *Fixed a performance regression (since v19.06) in the following filters: Chroma Hold, Flip, LUT 3D, Mirror, Noise: Fast, Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.
  *Fixed reloading the filter UI for Rutt-Etra-Izer, Text: 3D, and Text: HTML resets the filter trimming in Keyframes.
  *Added support for keyframes to the Lens Correction and Mosaic video filters.
  *Fixed Swirl when maximum = 0%.
  *Changed the minimum values for Mosaic to 0%.
  *Removed the scrolling animation from the Blank Web Animations HTML template.
  *Fixed pasting filters changes the trim and keyframes of the existing filters.
  *Fixed Crop: Circle and Crop: Rectangle not clearing the canvas resulting in trails in some situations.
  *Fixed color incorrect when using the LUT 3D filter with some other filters following it.
  *Fixed reliability of the Stabilize video filter to write its results (.stab) file.
  *Fixed showing vidstab.trf as a missing file.
  *Fixed updating Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass results to clips copied between Source, Playlist, and Timeline.
  *Added the ability for the Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass filters' analysis jobs to update pending export jobs.
  *Added the option to run pending Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass filters' analysis jobs on export. This only works for Stabilize if you are using the project folder feature. Or, if not using the project folder feature, you must click Analyze to assign a results file name, but you can stop the analysis job.
  *The combination of the above fixes and changes means you can now easily batch convert files while applying image stabilization and audio normalization!
  *Added support for interlace output to Properties > Reverse and Convert to Edit-friendly including overrides for Scan mode and field order.
  *Improved detection of interlaced video in some files such as Ut Video in Matroska.
  *Added Comments to image properties along with a menu button with: Copy Full File Path, Show in Folder, and Set Creation Time...
  *Add resolution and refresh rates to the screens in Settings > External Monitor to make them easier to differentiate.
  *Fixed switching between different external screens on the same GPU.
  *Fixed external screen not showing on correct screen in some arrangements.
  *Changed the default video quality to 55% for the Default and YouTube presets. This aligns with the x264 default crf of 23 and produces a smaller file that most people desire for upload without significant quality loss.
  *Added text after Export > Advanced > Codec > Quality to show the generated codec-specific quality level (e.g. crf for x264).
  *Fixed Stream broken by check for writable file.
  *Fixed double-click in Recent Projects loading twice.
  *Fixed disabling meters in the Audio Loudness scope not shrinking space.
  *Added version metadata to the AppImage for Linux.
  *Added md5sums.txt and sha256sums.txt to the GitHub releases page.
  *Added saving Timeline track height to configuration, not only a project file.
  *Fixed trimming an unselected clip in Timeline does not correctly adjust its filters.
  *Changed Settings > Interpolation > Nearest Neighbor to no longer relax seek accuracy. Instead, seek accuracy is now relaxed only during trick playback (reverse, rewind, fast forward).
  *Added a Korean translation.
