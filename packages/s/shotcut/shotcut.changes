  https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v20.04.12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 18:56:50 UTC 2020 - Pavol Cupka <palica@liguros.net>

- Update to release version 20.02.17
- Upstream changes:
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed dropping multiple files to Playlist in a new project (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed some broken keyboard shortcuts in the Turkish translation.
    - Fixed Properties > Speed not working after a project file repair.
    - Fixed clip selection after Insert Track or Remove Track.
    - Fixed Playlist > Add Selected to Timeline creates corrupt clips (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed Settings > Display Method > Software (Mesa) on Windows (broken in v19.12.31).
    - Fixed creating a Project folder with leading or trailing spaces.
    - Fixed saving the length property in MLT XML as a time value independent of frame rate.
    - Fixed starting Text: Simple video filter with "@" shows "0".
    - Fixed seeking previous & next on the first track in Keyframes where you trim a filter or use simple keyframes.
    - Fixed an unexpected transition is created when moving a clip rightward adjacent to the next clip in Timeline (regression in v19.12.16).
    - Fixed drag-n-drop from Source player to Timeline left player in an inconsistent state (broken in v19.09.14).
    - Fixed an inconsistent colorspace conversion when accessing a cached image.
    - Fixed Playlist > Copy followed by a change in Properties incorrectly changes the playlist item.
    - Fixed clicking on the rectangle control may change its size.
    - Fixed using the LUT (3D) filter with file with extended characters in its file path on Windows.
    - Fixed a crash when using a transition on every track at the same time.
  - Changes:
    - Improved the reliability of Timeline > Select None.
    - Changed Timeline > Master > Properties > Frame rate to show 6 decimal digits.
    - Reduced the latency of scrubbing (regression in v19.12.31).
    - Changed the video-overlay rectangle control used in some filters to allow changing the position by dragging from anywhere inside the rectangle.
    - To enable, one must first double-click the center circle to put it into a positioning-locked mode. Otherwise, you would be prevented from dragging the clip out of the Source player.
    - Changed the Filters panel on macOS to prevent floating to avoid a frequently reported problem of the Filters window appearing blank/black.
    - Changed Timeline > clip context menu > Detach Audio to not seek afterwards.
    - Improved mouse wheel and trackpad behavior in Timeline.
    - Now, you do not need to ensure the mouse pointer is over a clip, speed is reduced, and zoom keeps focal point in view. The new zoom behavior does not apply when using the option Center the Playhead in the timeline menu.
    - Upgraded MLT to version 6.20.0 and WebVfx to version 1.2.0.
  - New:
    - Added Settings > Preview Scaling!
      This reduces the resolution for rendering effects for preview within the app, but there may be added a fair cost to the CPU for down-scaling sources to the preview resolution. Thus, this will be more beneficial when low resolution proxies are created, which is planned for version 20.04 in April.
      Please understand that preview scaling will not always provide perfect fidelity. Some differences are unavoidable especially where blur, softness, and noise are concerned.
      Some filters may not support preview scaling and will process at full project resolution:
          Choppy
          Rutt-Etra-Izer
          Stabilize
          Text: HTML > Blank with Web Animations
          Text: HTML > Simple Scroll
          Text: HTML > Two Column Scroll
    - Added Export > Advanced > Video >Use preview scaling.
      This is intended to provide a faster export for draft review. You should leave the export resolution set to the project resolution unless your preset or video codec dictates a resolution.
    - Added Views > Scopes > Video Vector.
      Note that the graticule on this is non-traditional, inspired by Alexis Van Hurkman.
    - Added Filters > Audio > Pitch.
      This is handy when changing the speed of a clip anywhere from 4.0x - 0.25x.
    - Added the ability to rename clips in Properties by clicking into the header where the name is displayed.
    - Added support for using a video clip in Transition Properties > Video.
      This is handy to use with @jonray's matte transitions.
    - Added a few more export presets:
          audio/ALAC
          audio/FLAC
          intermediate/DNxHR HQ
          intermediate/ProRes HQ
          intermediate/ProRes was changed to ProRes 422
    - Added Arabic translation.
- Remove patch shotcut-noupdatecheck.patch no longer needed,
  the package can be now configured to not check for updates

  (by removing share/mlt/lumas/*.pgm and computing them on-demand).
  *Upgraded FFmpeg to v4.2.
  *Increased export process priority on
  Windows from Low (idle) to Below Normal.
  *Changed default HEVC
  quality to 45% so the x265 crf matches its default of 28.
  *Added the clip's name to the end of a clip in Timeline if its
  block is wide enough.
  *No longer seek after dropping a clip from the player to the
  Timeline.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 00:29:55 UTC 2019 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- Update to release version 19.08.16
- Upstream changes:
  *Changed Playlist > Open As Clip to simply Open. This action now opens the playlist item directly in the Source player, and all changes made in Source (trim in/out), Properties, Filters, and Keyframes apply to the playlist item immediately without an explicit update.
  *Added Playlist > Copy that opens a copy of the playlist item in Source just like the old behavior. This is useful if you want to trim out another shot from the same source clip or create a different sub-clip with different filtering.
  *Changed double-click on a playlist item to Open the clip instead of Copy it.
  *Added keyboard shortcut Shift+C to Copy a playlist item.
  *Now, when you drag a clip from Playlist to Timeline the timeline shows an appropriately-size box on a track.
  *Fixed a performance regression (since v19.06) in the following filters: Chroma Hold, Flip, LUT 3D, Mirror, Noise: Fast, Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.
  *Fixed reloading the filter UI for Rutt-Etra-Izer, Text: 3D, and Text: HTML resets the filter trimming in Keyframes.
  *Added support for keyframes to the Lens Correction and Mosaic video filters.
  *Fixed Swirl when maximum = 0%.
  *Changed the minimum values for Mosaic to 0%.
  *Removed the scrolling animation from the Blank Web Animations HTML template.
  *Fixed pasting filters changes the trim and keyframes of the existing filters.
  *Fixed Crop: Circle and Crop: Rectangle not clearing the canvas resulting in trails in some situations.
  *Fixed color incorrect when using the LUT 3D filter with some other filters following it.
  *Fixed reliability of the Stabilize video filter to write its results (.stab) file.
  *Fixed showing vidstab.trf as a missing file.
  *Fixed updating Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass results to clips copied between Source, Playlist, and Timeline.
  *Added the ability for the Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass filters' analysis jobs to update pending export jobs.
  *Added the option to run pending Stabilize and Normalize: Two Pass filters' analysis jobs on export. This only works for Stabilize if you are using the project folder feature. Or, if not using the project folder feature, you must click Analyze to assign a results file name, but you can stop the analysis job.
  *The combination of the above fixes and changes means you can now easily batch convert files while applying image stabilization and audio normalization!
  *Added support for interlace output to Properties > Reverse and Convert to Edit-friendly including overrides for Scan mode and field order.
  *Improved detection of interlaced video in some files such as Ut Video in Matroska.
  *Added Comments to image properties along with a menu button with: Copy Full File Path, Show in Folder, and Set Creation Time...
  *Add resolution and refresh rates to the screens in Settings > External Monitor to make them easier to differentiate.
  *Fixed switching between different external screens on the same GPU.
  *Fixed external screen not showing on correct screen in some arrangements.
  *Changed the default video quality to 55% for the Default and YouTube presets. This aligns with the x264 default crf of 23 and produces a smaller file that most people desire for upload without significant quality loss.
  *Added text after Export > Advanced > Codec > Quality to show the generated codec-specific quality level (e.g. crf for x264).
  *Fixed Stream broken by check for writable file.
  *Fixed double-click in Recent Projects loading twice.
  *Fixed disabling meters in the Audio Loudness scope not shrinking space.
  *Added version metadata to the AppImage for Linux.
  *Added md5sums.txt and sha256sums.txt to the GitHub releases page.
  *Added saving Timeline track height to configuration, not only a project file.
  *Fixed trimming an unselected clip in Timeline does not correctly adjust its filters.
  *Changed Settings > Interpolation > Nearest Neighbor to no longer relax seek accuracy. Instead, seek accuracy is now relaxed only during trick playback (reverse, rewind, fast forward).
  *Added a Korean translation.
