  * Added support for relaxation Runge-Kutta methods to ERKStep
    and ARKStep in ARKODE.
  * Added the second order IMEX method from Giraldo, Kelly, and
    Constantinescu 2013 as the default second order IMEX method in
    ARKStep.
  * Updated CVODE, CVODES and ARKODE default behavior when
    returning the solution when the internal time has reached a
    user-specified stop time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 09:07:55 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add Requires: libsundials_sunmatrix4 explicitly for
  libsundials_sunlinsol4_3_0; automatic deps fails to distinguish
  between serial and mpi flavors causing resolving issues when
  building apps dependent on libsundials_sunlinsol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 14 05:05:44 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 6.3.0:
  * Added GetUserData functions in each package to retrieve the
    user data pointer provided to SetUserData functions
  * Fixed a bug in ERKStepReset, ERKStepReInit, ARKStepReset,
    ARKStepReInit, MRIStepReset, and MRIStepReInit where a
    previously-set value of tstop (from a call to
    ERKStepSetStopTime, ARKStepSetStopTime, or MRIStepSetStopTime,
    respectively) would not be cleared.
  * Updated MRIStepReset to call the corresponding
    MRIStepInnerResetFn with the same (tR,yR) arguments for the
    MRIStepInnerStepper object that is used to evolve the MRI
    "fast" time scale subproblems.
  * Added a new example which demonstrates using CVODE with a
    discontinuous right-hand-side function and rootfinding.
  * Added a variety of embedded DIRK methods from [Kennedy &
    Carpenter, NASA TM-2016-219173, 2016] and [Kennedy &
    Carpenter, Appl. Numer. Math., 146, 2019] to ARKODE.
  * Fixed the unintuitive behavior of the USE_GENERIC_MATH CMake
    option which caused the double precision math functions to be
    used regardless of the value of SUNDIALS_PRECISION.
  * Changed SUNDIALS_LOGGING_ENABLE_MPI CMake option default to be
   'OFF'.
- Split off sundials-sunlibs (previously libsundials4) into
  individual shared lib packages: libsundials_sunlinsol4_3_0,
  libsundials_sunmatrix4, and libsundials_sunnonlin3_3_0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 12:46:04 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Rename libsundials4 to sundials-sunlibs as it packages multiple
  shared libs pertaining to the main sundials library; shlib
  naming guidelines do not apply in this case.
- Drop no longer needed rpmlintrc file.
- Make -doc package into noarch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  7 07:58:18 UTC 2022 - Klaus Kämpf <kkaempf@suse.com>

- add _constraints (boo#1201273)

  See https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

- https://github.com/LLNL/sundials is now the official SUNDIALS
  development repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 27 09:16:26 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Add rpmlintrc for shlib-policy-name-error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 00:13:27 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 5.7.0:
  * A new NVECTOR implementation based on the SYCL abstraction layer has been added
    targeting Intel GPUs. At present the only SYCL compiler supported is the DPC++
    (Intel oneAPI) compiler. See the SYCL NVECTOR section in the user guide for
    more details. This module is considered experimental and is subject to major
    changes even in minor releases.
  * A new SUNMatrix and SUNLinearSolver implementation were added to interface with
    the MAGMA linear algebra library. Both the matrix and the linear solver support
    general dense linear systems as well as block diagonal linear systems, and both
    are targeted at GPUs (AMD or NVIDIA).
  * Fixed a bug in the SUNDIALS CMake which caused an error if the
    CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD and SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS options were not provided.
  * Fixed some compiler warnings when using the IBM XL compilers.
  * A new NVECTOR implementation based on the AMD ROCm HIP platform has been added.
    This vector can target NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. See HIP NVECTOR section in the user
    guide for more details. This module is considered experimental and is subject
    to change from version to version.
  * The RAJA NVECTOR implementation has been updated to support the HIP backend in
    addition to the CUDA backend. Users can choose the backend when configuring
    SUNDIALS by using the `SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS` CMake variable. This module
    remains experimental and is subject to change from version to version.
 *  A new optional operation, `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer`, was added to the N_Vector
    API. This operation is useful for N_Vectors that utilize dual memory spaces,
    e.g. the native SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector.
 *  The SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE and SUNLINEARSOLVER_CUSOLVERSP_BATCHQR implementations
    no longer require the SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector. Instead, they require that the
    vector utilized provides the `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` operation, and that the
    pointer returned by `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` is a valid CUDA device pointer.
- Minor refreshing of sundials-link-pthread.patch to apply cleanly
  against updated sources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 12:59:07 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.5.0:
  * Refactored the SUNDIALS CMake build system to improve build
    times by as much as 35%.
  * CMake 3.12.0 or newer is now required.
  * Users will likely see CMake deprecation warnings, and
    potentially new errors when incompatible CMake options have
    been set (previously, these would fail silently).
  * SUNDIALS now exports CMake targets and installs a
    SUNDIALSConfig.cmake file.
  * Added support for SuperLU DIST 6.3.0+.
- Add sundials-link-pthread.patch: Link against pthread explicitly
  to fix linking errors when `-Wl,--no-undefined` is added to the
  linker flags; patch sent upstream.
- Add BuildRequires: suitesparse-devel and enable KLU solver; pass
  appropriate options to cmake to make sure the klu library and
  header is correctly found.
- Use cmake macros instead of manual cmake commands.
- Split out new libsundials_generic package with the
  libsundials_generic shared library.
- Enable openmpi4 flavour.
- Run tests except for tests that fail due to floating point
  errors in the tests themselves.
- Drop Group tags.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 07:55:15 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.3.0:
  * Added support to CVODE for integrating IVPs with constraints
    using BDF methods and projecting the solution onto the
    constraint manifold with a user defined projection function.
  * Added the ability to control the CUDA kernel launch parameters
    for the NVECTOR_CUDA and SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE modules.
  * The NVECTOR_CUDA kernels were rewritten to be more flexible.
  * Added new capabilities for monitoring the solve phase in the
    SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON and SUNNONLINSOL_FIXEDPOINT modules, and
    the SUNDIALS iterative linear solver modules.
  * Added specialized fused CUDA kernels to CVODE which may offer
    better performance on smaller problems when using CVODE with
    the NVECTOR_CUDA module.
  * Added a new function, CVodeSetMonitorFn, that takes a
    user-function to be called by CVODE after every nst
    successfully completed time-steps.
  * Added a new function CVodeGetLinSolveStats to get the CVODE
    linear solver statistics as a group.
  * Added optional set functions to provide an alternative ODE
    right-hand side function (ARKode and CVODE(S)), DAE residual
    function (IDA(S)), or nonlinear system function (KINSOL) for
    use when computing Jacobian-vector products with the internal
    difference quotient approximation.
  * Fixed a bug in ARKode where the prototypes for
    ERKStepSetMinReduction() and ARKStepSetMinReduction() were not
    included in arkode_erkstep.h and arkode_arkstep.h
    respectively.
  * Fixed a bug in ARKode where inequality constraint checking
    would need to be disabled and then re-enabled to update the
    inequality constraint values after resizing a problem.
  * Fixed a bug in the iterative linear solver modules where an
    error is not returned if the Atimes function is NULL or, if
    preconditioning is enabled, the PSolve function is NULL.
- Pass SUNDIALS_BUILD_WITH_MONITORING=ON to cmake to enable
  monitoring the solve phase in different iterative solver
  modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  9 22:30:30 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.2.0 (See
  https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/release-history for
  details):
  - Fixed a bug in how ARKode interfaces with a user-supplied,
    iterative, unscaled linear solver.
  - Fixed a bug in how ARKode interfaces with a user-supplied,
    iterative, unscaled linear solver.
  - Fixed a similar bug in how ARKode interfaces with scaled
    linear solvers when solving problems with non-identity mass
    matrices.
  - Fixed a memory leak in CVODES and IDAS from not deallocating
    the atolSmin0 and atolQSmin0 arrays.
  - Fixed a bug where a non-default value for the maximum allowed
    growth factor after the first step would be ignored.
  - Functions were added to each of the time integration packages
    to enable or disable the scaling applied to linear system
    solutions with matrix-based linear solvers to account for
    lagged matrix information.
  - Added two new functions, ARKStepSetMinReduction() and
    ERKStepSetMinReduction() to change the minimum allowed step
    size reduction factor after an error test failure.
  - Added a new SUNMatrix implementation, SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE, that
    interfaces to the sparse matrix implementation from the NVIDIA
    cuSPARSE library.
  - Added a new "stiff" interpolation module to ARKode, based on
    Lagrange polynomial interpolation, that is accessible to each
    of the ARKStep, ERKStep and MRIStep time-stepping modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 12:03:45 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Remove duplicated definitions.
- Remove bogus undefines of suffix and mpi_flavor for "serial"
  flavour. The former causes builds to fail for openSUSE >= 1550
  using rpm >= 4.15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 09:11:01 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Run spec-cleaner for minor cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  7 18:18:36 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.0.0:
  * Two new NVector implementations created to support flexible
    partitioning of solution data among different processing
    elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics problems that
    couple distinct MPI-based simulations together:
    NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR, amd NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR,
  * An additional NVector implementation, NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX, has
    been created to support the MPI+X paradigm where X is a type
    of on-node parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA),
  * One new required NVector operation, N_VGetLength, and ten new
    optional vector operations have been added to the NVector API,
  * Two new SUNLinearSolver implementations,
    SUNLINEARSOLVER_SUPERLUDIST which interfaces with the
    SuperLU_DIST distributed, sparse, linear solver library, and
    the SUNLINEARSOLVER_CUSOLVERSP_BATCHQR, which interfaces to
    the cuSOLVE sparse batched QR linear solver,
  * A new SUNNonlinearSolver implementation,
    SUNNONLINSOL_PETSCSNES, which provides an interface to the
    PETSc SNES API,
  * New Fortran 2003 interface modules that provide Fortran users
    access to most of the SUNDIALS C API including ARKode,
    CVODE(S), IDA(S), and KINSOL,
  * Support for using explicit, implicit, or IMEX methods as the
    fast integrator with the MRIStep time-stepper in ARKode,
  * Several other minor changes and bug fixes: see
    https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/release-history.
- Merge all nvec solver libraries into a single shared lib
  package: %{shlib_nvec}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  7 17:23:58 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Enable multibuild with serial, openmpi1, openmpi2, openmpi3,
  and mvapich2 flavours.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 10 13:08:49 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Follow shared library packaging policy and split out multiple
  versioned shlib packages. The main shared lib %{shlib_main}
  contains the common shared objects, while each individual solver
  gets its own shared lib package.
- Add blas-devel and lapack-devel BuildRequires; enable blas and
  lapack (does not work with 64 bits) during cmake.
- Enable pthread.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 10 10:26:43 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 4.1.0:
  * An additional N_Vector implementation was added for Tpetra
    vector from Trilinos library to facilitate interoperability
    between SUNDIALS and Trilinos. This implementation is
    accompanied by additions to user documentation and SUNDIALS
    examples.
  * A bug was fixed where a nonlinear solver object could be freed
    twice in some use cases.
  * The EXAMPLES_ENABLE_RAJA CMake option has been removed. The
    option EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CUDA enables all examples that use CUDA
    including the RAJA examples with a CUDA back end (if the RAJA
    NVECTOR is enabled).
  * The implementation header files (e.g. arkode_impl.h) are no
    longer installed. This means users who are directly
    manipulating package memory structures will need to update
    their code to use the package’s public API.
  * Python is no longer required to run make test and make
    test_install.
  * Fixed a bug in ARKodeButcherTable_Write when printing a
    Butcher table without an embedding.
