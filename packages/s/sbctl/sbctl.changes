- Update to version 0.13:
  * --export,-e and --database-path,-d now work properly and don't
    overwrite the create-keys variables internally
  * remove erronous dbx enrollment. Previous release implemented
    support for dbx that doesn't really work as expected. It
    would also fail to enroll keys for previously setup clients.
    Implementation has been removed and will be iterated upon at a
    later date.
  * make: fix github artifact upload
  * Change shebang
  * Ensure file signing hook is run when initrd is rebuilt
  * Fixed typo, removed mention enroll-keys enables Secure Boot
    automatically
  * Ignore Setup mode and immutable variables for export
  * Specify file origin + always print signing message
  * tests/utils/certs.go: drop keyUsage bitfield
  * update manpage docs
  * allow specifying keys and GUID paths
  * Update README.md
  * keys.go: drop the keyUsage bitfield
  * Check and return Open errs
  * Update documentation for custom dbx

- Update to version 0.12:
  * sbctl bundle might be depreciated in the future.
  * sbctl now allows you to enroll custom certificates into KEK
    and db. 
  * sbctl now allows keys to be exported as EFI Signature Lists
    (esl) or EFI Authenticated Variables (auth), which are pre-signed.
  * sbctl can now enroll certificates found in dbxDefault,
    dbDefault, KEKDefault and PKDefault.
  * Before this release sbctl would enroll, reset and rotate the
    entire key hierarchy when requested. With this release several
    improvements have been made to have the ability to support
    partial key hierarchies. This can be used through the --partial
    flag in their respective commands.
  * add documentation for the extra flags of enroll/rotate/reset
  * feat: add option to remove specific certs from db instead of an entire reset
  * feat: add append option to enroll-keys
  * feat: force key flag
  * Add support for OEM dbx enrollment
  * feat(dbx): enroll/rotate/reset dbx keys
  * feat(rotate): enable partial rotation and providing different sources
  * feat(reset): enable partial resets of secureboot keys
  * feat(enroll-keys): add partial enrollment of keys
  * Implement full support for loading builtin firmware certificates
  * Add support for loading certificates from dbDefault
