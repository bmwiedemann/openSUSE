-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 31 23:55:22 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.15.3:
  * Fixed a mistake where the db_additions setting in sbctl.conf
    was not wired up to sbctl setup.
  * Relaxed the check for an existing install in sbctl setup form
    looking after /var/lib/sbctl to check for /var/lib/sbctl/keys.
  * Fixed a bug where dmi information was not read for quirk
    detection when landlock was enabled.
  * Fixed a bug where sbctl create-keys did not have access to
    /var/lib under landlock.
  * Fixed a bug where sbctl setup didn't have access to /usr/share.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 31 14:13:47 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Added minimum go required version
- Update to version 0.15.2:
  * Fixed a bug where sbctl setup aborts early because
    /var/lib/sbctl already exists.
- Updates from version 0.15.1:
  * Fixed an issue where sbctl migrate did not work without
    --disable-landlock.
  * Fixed an issue where bundles.db would be written to files.json
    deleting list of files.
- Updates from version 0.15:
  See the release for full changes.
  https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl/releases/tag/0.15
  * sbctl will try to sandbox all commands with landlock. Landlock
    is a unpriviledged sandbox, similar to OpenBSD pledge, that
    allows sbctl to declare the directories and files we are
    reading/writing a head. This feature is enabled by default and
    can be disabled by setting landlock: false in the new config
    file, or by passing --disable-landlock flag.
  * sbctl has moved from using /usr/share/secureboot to
    /var/lib/sbctl. The useage of /usr was mostly for legacy
    reasons but there wasn't any motivation to fix this until now.
    To help with the migration sbctl migrate has been implemented.
    It will move all the files from the old location to
    /var/lib/sbctl and rename files accordingly.
  * sbctl now support creation of TPM key files using
    go-tpm-keyfiles. These keys are mostly compatible with how
    other TPM2 TSS keyfiles are created. This key type can be used
    by passing on of several keytype flags to create-keys or
    rotate-keys, or by specifying the type in the new configuration
    file.

    system to a directory
  * list-enrolled-keys will list the enrolled keys on the system
  New Things
  * The test suite has now been rewritten to use the new vmtest
    library.
  Bugfixes
  * sign-all won't abort when it encounters a file it can't sign.
  * The kernel-install hook won't try to sign things if there are
    no signing keys available.

    actually did exist on the system.

Wed Dec 27 08:21:25 UTC 2023 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.13:
  * --export,-e and --database-path,-d now work properly and don't
    overwrite the create-keys variables internally
  * remove erronous dbx enrollment. Previous release implemented
    support for dbx that doesn't really work as expected. It
    would also fail to enroll keys for previously setup clients.
    Implementation has been removed and will be iterated upon at a
    later date.
  * make: fix github artifact upload
  * Change shebang
  * Ensure file signing hook is run when initrd is rebuilt
  * Fixed typo, removed mention enroll-keys enables Secure Boot
    automatically
  * Ignore Setup mode and immutable variables for export
  * Specify file origin + always print signing message
  * tests/utils/certs.go: drop keyUsage bitfield
  * update manpage docs
  * allow specifying keys and GUID paths
  * Update README.md
  * keys.go: drop the keyUsage bitfield
  * Check and return Open errs
  * Update documentation for custom dbx

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 20 23:32:22 UTC 2023 - Joshua Smith <jsmithfpv@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.12:
  * sbctl bundle might be depreciated in the future.
  * sbctl now allows you to enroll custom certificates into KEK
    and db. 
  * sbctl now allows keys to be exported as EFI Signature Lists
    (esl) or EFI Authenticated Variables (auth), which are pre-signed.
  * sbctl can now enroll certificates found in dbxDefault,
    dbDefault, KEKDefault and PKDefault.
  * Before this release sbctl would enroll, reset and rotate the
    entire key hierarchy when requested. With this release several
    improvements have been made to have the ability to support
    partial key hierarchies. This can be used through the --partial
    flag in their respective commands.
  * add documentation for the extra flags of enroll/rotate/reset
  * feat: add option to remove specific certs from db instead of an entire reset
  * feat: add append option to enroll-keys
  * feat: force key flag
  * Add support for OEM dbx enrollment
  * feat(dbx): enroll/rotate/reset dbx keys
  * feat(rotate): enable partial rotation and providing different sources
  * feat(reset): enable partial resets of secureboot keys
  * feat(enroll-keys): add partial enrollment of keys
  * Implement full support for loading builtin firmware certificates
  * Add support for loading certificates from dbDefault
