  <title>Your everyday IRC student</title>
  <description>senpai is a terminal IRC client that works best with bouncers:

 * no logs are kept,
 * history is fetched from the server via CHATHISTORY,
 * networks are fetched from the server via bouncer-networks,
 * messages can be searched in logs via SEARCH,
 * files can be uploaded via FILEHOST (with drag &amp; drop!)</description>
