We 'outsourced' the handling of users and groups for 
nagios into this package.

As result, this package creates the following user:
 nagios
and the following groups:
 nagios
 nagcmd

This should be handled transparently with old (shadow based) and 
new (systemd based) systems.

Remember to have a lot of fun!
 Your (open)SUSE team
