Tue May  4 09:45:52 UTC 2021 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.16.0
  * This release adds untrusted / encrypted devices for public testing. It
    should still be considered beta / testing-only. 

  * Bugfixes:
    #7026: panic: key not found when repairing DB
    #7379: "Warning, this path is a subdirectory of an existing folder" does not appear when editing only folder label
    #7533: Remote completion on untrusted devices is incorrect
    #7548: Upgrading syncthing-relaysrv to 1.15.0 fails in post-installation
    #7551: QUIC: failed to determine receive buffer size: doesn't have a SyscallConn
    #7557: Encrypted folder(s) on Windows reported as "Unexpected Objects"
    #7568: panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [24:3]
    #7584: Folder label missing from folder path when adding new folders

  * Enhancements:
    #109: Support for file encryption (e.g. non-trusted servers)
    #3322: GUI "Out of sync" modal uses massive amounts of CPU in browser
    #7520: Ask for confirmation before reverting/overriding a folder

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  7 10:43:16 UTC 2021 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.15.0/1.15.1
  * This release fixes a vulnerability where Syncthing and the relay server
    can crash due to malformed relay protocol messages (CVE-2021-21404); see
    GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h. (boo#1184428)

  * This release updates the CLI to use subcommands and adds the subcommands
    cli (previously standalone stcli utility) and decrypt (for offline
    verifying and decrypting encrypted folders).

  * With this release we invite everyone to test the "untrusted (encrypted)
    devices" feature. You should not use it yet on important production
    data. Thus UI controls are hidden behind a feature flag. For more
    information, visit:
    https://forum.syncthing.net/t/testing-untrusted-encrypted-devices/16470 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  3 09:45:30 UTC 2021 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.14.0

  * The output format of the /rest/db/browse endpoint has changed. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  3 19:37:41 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.13.1:
  * This release adds configuration options for min/max connections (see
    https://docs.syncthing.net/advanced/option-connection-limits.html) and
    moves the storage of pending devices/folders from the config to the
    database (see https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/rest.html#cluster-endpoints).
  * Bugfixes
  * Official builds of v1.13.0 come with the Tech Ui, which is impossible to
    switch back from

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 17 23:55:10 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.12.1:
  * Invalid names are allowed and "auto accepted" in folder root path on Windows
  * Sometimes indexes for some folders aren't sent after starting Syncthing
  * [Untrusted] Remove Unexpected Items leaves things behind
  * Wrong theme on selection
  * Quic spamming address resolving
  * Deleted locally changed items still shown as locally changed
  * Allow specifying remote expected web UI port which would generate a href somewhere
  * Ignore fsync errors when saving ignore files 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  1 14:58:51 UTC 2020 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.12.0
  - The 1.12.0 release
    - adds a new config REST API.
  - The 1.11.0 release
    - adds the sendFullIndexOnUpgrade option to control whether
      all index data is resent when an upgrade is detected, equivalent
      to starting Syncthing with --reset-deltas. This
      (sendFullIndexOnUpgrade=true) used to be the behavior in previous
      versions, but is mainly useful as a troubleshooting step and
      causes high database churn. The new default is false.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  6 11:28:20 UTC 2020 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.10.0
  - This release adds the config option announceLANAddresses to enable
    (the default) or disable announcing private (RFC1918) LAN IP addresses
    to global discovery. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 16:38:38 UTC 2020 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0
  - This release adds the advanced folder option caseSensitiveFS
    (https://docs.syncthing.net/advanced/folder-caseSensitiveFS.html) to
    disable the new safe handling of case insensitive filesystems. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 11:44:33 UTC 2020 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Fix Leap build by requiring at least Go 1.14

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 18 11:46:09 UTC 2020 - Marius Kittler <marius.kittler@suse.com>

- Prevent the build system to download Go modules which would require an
  internet connection during the build
- Update to 1.8.0
  - The 1.8.0 release
    - adds the experimental copyRangeMethod config on folders, for use on
      filesystems with copy-on-write support. Please see
      https://docs.syncthing.net/advanced/folder-copyrangemethod.html for
      details.
    - adds TCP hole punching, used to establish high performance TCP
      connections in certain NAT scenarios where only relay or QUIC
      connections could be used previously.
    - adds a configuration to file versioning for how often to run cleanup.
      This defaults to once an hour, but is configurable from very
      frequently to never.
  - The 1.7.0 release performs a database migration to optimize for clusters
    with many devices.
  - The 1.6.0 release performs a database schema migration, and adds the
    BlockPullOrder, DisableFsync and MaxConcurrentWrites folder
    options to the configuration schema. The LocalChangeDetected event no
    longer has the action set to added for new files, instead showing modified
    for all local file changes.
  - The 1.5.0 release changes the default location for the index database under
    some circumstances. Two new flags can also be used to affect the
    location of the configuration (-config) and database (-data)
    separately. The old -home flag is equivalent to setting both of these
    to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is
    used to determine the data location:

    If a database exists in the old default location, that location is
    still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this
    change.
    If $XDG_DATA_HOME is set, use $XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing.
    If ~/.local/share/syncthing exists, use that location.
    Use the old default location.

- Update to version 0.14.15 (changes since 0.14.13):
  * Fix a security issue resulted in Syncthing accepting index
    entries for files like '../../foo', thus resulting in a path
    above the configured directory.
  * Fix a security issue resulted in symlinks be used to trick
    Syncthing and escape constraints of the configured directory by
    creating a symlink 'foo -> ../../' and then requesting the
    contents of 'foo/something' (boo#1016161).
    Syncing symlinks between v0.14.14+ and previous versions will
    not work.

    package and disables it on subsequent launch
    (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3613).
  * The two hash packages are benchmarked on startup and the
    fastest on is selected (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3614).
  * Directories are now correctly shown as out of sync when they
    miss only deleted files (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3588).
  * UPnP handling is corrected in the case where more than one

- Update to version 0.14.5:
  * Improve completion percentage calculations
    (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3492, gh#syncthing/syncthing#3493).
  * A zero progress update interval doesn't drive up CPU usage
    during syncing any more (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3517).

    become spuriously out of sync (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3516).
  * Remove temporary index sorting databases from disk at startup,
    if left over after a hard stop (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3529).
  * Now automatic upgrade takes more care to not leave temporaries
    behind or remove the original in case of upgrade failure
    (gh#syncthing/syncthing#3500, gh#syncthing/syncthing#3530).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 14 16:54:52 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.14.2 (changes since 0.14.0):
  * Implement "delta indexes", a backwards compatible protocol
    enhancement. Prior to delta indexes being implemented, full
    index information was exchanged at every connection start.
    With delta indexes, only index information that has changed
    since last contact is transferred.
  * Files that grow or shrink during scanning would result in
    conflicts or inconsistent data after synchronisation.

  Only pass template units to preun (disable); no other actions
  are defined for them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 17 17:13:51 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.13.0:
  * Devices now announce files that are in progress of being
    downloaded, in addition to those that are already complete.
    This means a device can serve parts of a file to other devices
    before it has completed the download itself.
  * Directory labels are now distinct from the directory ID.
    The intention is for the label to be human readable and for the
    ID to be machine readable and unique. When upgrading,
    directory IDs are not changed. However when creating new
    directories Syncthing will suggest a random, unique directory
    ID.
  * When receiving a connection attempt from an unknown device
    Syncthing will now show the name of that device, not only it's
    ID.
  * Syncthing will now manage port mappings on NAT-PMP compliant
    routers, in addition to the existing UPnP support.
  * Ignored files can now be tagged with the prefix (?d) to
    indicate that Syncthing may delete these files if they remain
    when deleting a directory. Ignore patterns use less memory by
    default.
  * The address for sync connections, both the listening side and
    for remote devices, can now be made IPv4- or IPv6-only. Use the
    tcp4:// or tcp6:// schemes to specify one or the other. The
    default tcp:// is still dual stack. Additionally, relays are
    now treated as listen addresses and set in the same
    configuration setting.
  * The directory settings dialog has been cleaned up.
  * The environment variable ALL_PROXY_NO_FALLBACK can be set to
    disable falling back to direct connections in the absence of a
    working proxy.
  * The "Syncing" complete percentage for remote devices may
    erroneously display more than 100% (i.e. 156% or 297%) while a
    remote device is still synchronising.
  * Many, many bug fixes.
