  <title>Simple viewer for Structured Fax Files (.sff) used by ISDN applications</title>
  <description>The CAPI interface for programming ISDN hardware expects and gives you
faxes in the &quot;Structured Fax File&quot; (SFF) format.

SffView is a viewer for SFF-files. SffView is written in C++ using the
wxWidgets/wxGTK toolkit and is therefore available for Linux and
Windows (wxWidgets is a platform independent toolkit and wxGTK is a
unix implementation based on GTK+, see wxWidgets homepage).</description>
