    <comment>Strawberry is a audio player and music collection organizer. It is a fork of Clementine created in 2013 with a diffrent goal. It's written in C++ and Qt 5. The name is inspired by the band Strawbs.
It has advanced ALSA options and support for multiple backends. It's aimed at audio enthusiasts who play local music files.</comment>
