    as well.
- Add schily-stksz.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 31 14:04:05 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2021.07.29
  * Bourne Shell: "cd -" now prints the new directory,
    required by POSIX.

    before entering a new line character.
  * ved: ved now aborts the startup if it turns out to be connected to

Thu May 20 10:02:12 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2021.05.19
  * Bourne Shell: The "ERR" trap is now also triggered in case that
    the error is of type "command not found" or "cannot execute".
  * Bourne Shell: the fc(1) builtin now handles "fc -l -0" the same
    way as ksh does and refers to the current command. Before, only
    "fc -l -1" did work to select the previous command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  4 10:50:37 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2021.04.21
  * Bourne Shell: The new version no longer aborts with an
    illegal multi byte sequence as "no match". As a result, the
    "*" now again matches any filename - even if the filename
    contains an illegal multi-byte sequence.
  * SunPro Make: The new operators :::= and +:= have been
    introduced.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Bourne Shell: If a background job did finish during an
    implicit wait for a foreground job, the exit code for the
    background job was lost, which was fixed.
  * star: ACLs and Linux xattrs did not work if the path name to a
    file was longer than PATH_MAX, which was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 22:54:57 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.10.09
  * Bourne Shell: The "wait" builtin is now POSIX compliant and
    returns 127 in $? in case that a process id to be waited for
    does not exist.
  * Bourne Shell: The exit code retrieved by $/ no longer is
    masked by 0xFF when this code originates from a wait(1) call.
  * Bourne Shell: The exit code from background jobs is now kept
    until the builtin wait(1) is called.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 09:38:47 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.09.22

    diff(1) output.
  * SCCS: delta now supports nul bytes in the new version of the
    input file if processing SCCSv6 history files.
  * SCCS: delta now by default uses `fsdiff` instead of `bdiff`.
  * SCCS: delta, if called as `delta -d ...`, now calls diff(1)
    with the option -a.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 12:53:54 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.09.04
  * sccs: get(1) and delta(1) now restore the removed newline at
    the end of the last line if this was a SCCSv6 "^ANxxx" line
    to support files not ending in a newline.
  * sccs: The delta(1) command now correctly handles deltas where
    the last difference hits the end of the history file.
  * sccs: The delta(1) command now removes the e.file in case of
    an error abort.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 13 09:32:01 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.08.12
  * star: GNU cpio archives may contain longer path names than
    permitted by the AT&T documentation, problems with which
    where fixed.
  * sccs: sccslog again allows ovelapping delgets and now allows
    overlapping delget groups to be correctly detected as commit
    bundle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 19 22:24:38 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.07.18
  * star: star could dump core if it was used as `star -t ...` or
    `star -x ...` while being in a UTF-8 based locale and trying
    to deal with extremely long pathnames (more than PATH_MAX) in
    the archive.
  * fifo: the fifo command is based on the star FIFO code and has
    been changed to support a FIFO size > 2 GB as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  3 23:46:47 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.07.01
  * star: Backslashes are now honored when looking for the
    substitution separators in options like -s /from/to/ or
    -pax-s /from/to/
  * cdda2wav: The default for the CDDB database has been changed
    to gnudb.gnudb.org, as freedb.freedb.org has shutdown.
  * Full support for SCCSv6 history files.
  * SCCS: A new sccs(1) subcommand "histfile" has been
    implemented.
  * SCCS: admin fixed a potential buffer overflow related to the
    user (programmer) name that is used in the delta table.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  3 09:28:52 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Run tests after build.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  9 23:17:15 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.06.09
  * star: A new option -one-file has been added that causes star
    to exit after a single file has been extracted as a result
    from a pattern match or command line argument match.
  * star: A new option iskip=# has been introduced. The argument
    is the number of bytes to skip before looking for the first
    archive header in the first tape block read after star
    started.
  * star: A new option mtskip=# has been introduced. This option
    causes star to issue a "mt fsr xxx" equivalent on a tape
    archive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 26 11:32:10 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.05.25
  * mkisofs: Fixed an integer overflow bug in mac_label.c with
    Apple -chrp boot.
  * star: The subst command for pax now supports the \1, \2, ...
    escapes for \(...\) selections in the from pattern, like it
    is used by sed(1).
  * star: A new subst option -pax-s has been added that supports
    sed(1) like substitutions. The old option -s continues to
    support change(1) like substititions.
  * SCCS: A new option -X0 has been introduced to allow to use
    nul byte separated file names on stdin when using the file
    argument "-".
  * SCCS: The commands sccslog and sccscvt now also support the
    argument "-" as a directive to read filenames from stdin.
  * SCCS: `sccs init` now by default creates an empty changeset
    history file with release 1.0 as
    $SRC_ROOT/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset This signals SCCS to work in
    project mode where a group of files is managed together and
    the version 1.0 allows the first proect release to become
    1.1.
  * SCCS: `sccs init -s` now allows to initialize a directory
    tree without creating a $SRC_ROOT/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset
    history file. This signals SCCS to work in single file mode.
- Drop large_mac_iso.patch (merged)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 09:21:22 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.05.11
  * SCCS: the "sccs root" command now checks for too many
    arguments and only allows zero or one path arguments.
  * mkisofs: README.eltorito has been enhanced to mention
    "-boot-load-size" and "-eltorito-platform efi".
  * isoinfo: Identifying an EFI boot record has been added to
    mkisofs. Isoinfo is now able to print "efi" instead of the
    unexpected "Unknown arch".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 11 11:47:23 UTC 2020 - Adam Majer <adam.majer@suse.de>

- mkisofs: fix integer overflow in partition table calculation
  when chrp-boot is enabled and a large ISO image is created.
  (large_mac_iso.patch, bsc#1169420)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 29 08:26:30 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.04.18
  * smake: A new option -a has been added. This option allows to
    tell smake not to set up the automake specific make macros
    MAKE_ARCH, MAKE_OS and similar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 28 11:03:52 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.03.27
  * mkisofs: A new option -noatime has been introduced in order
    to use the modification time of the files instead of the last
    access time.
  * mkisofs: New options -creation-date, -effective-date,
    -expiration-date have been introduced in order to use the
    supplied time stamp instead of the current time in the PVD.
  * mkisofs: A new option -reproducible-date has been added. This
    option sets -creation-date, -modification-date,
    -effective-date and -noatime at the same time and helps to
    make usage easier.
  * Bourne Shell: The case statement now supports the alternate
    end case symbol ";;&" that has been introduced by bash. If
    ";;&" is used instead of ";;", the next pattern list is
    evaluated and if there is a match, the related command list
    is executed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 16 09:09:05 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.03.11
  * Bourne Shell: set -m now works in scripts as well. Before,
    bosh did never call startjobs() when the shell startup was
    done with a shell script.
  * Bourne Shell: The shell now supports the alternate ;& switch
    command limiter in addition to ;; where ;& implements a
    fallthrough to the next command list regardless on thether
    there is a match or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 12 15:08:56 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2020.02.11
  * Bourne Shell: A new variable ${.sh.path} returns the absolute
    path of the binary associated to the exec() for this shell.
  * Bourne Shell: `for i in; do cmd ...; done` is now valid
    syntax even though this is useless.
  * SCCS: comb.c now puts the filename in the created shell
    script in single quotes.
  * SCCS: comb.c now forbids single quotes and backslashes in
    filenames as they would cause problems with the shell script
    created by comb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  4 16:54:19 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Set -fcommon [boo#1160291].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 12 00:42:30 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2019.12.05
  * libschily: the function getargs() and similar (from the
    option parser group) now support an extended format
    specifier: Previously, %0 and %1 have been supported, now all
    single digit numbers %0..%9 are supported.
  * libfind: The functions fetchdir()/dfetchdir(), sortdir(),
    cmpdir() now use size_t instead of int for the entry number
    count and the allocated size.
  * star: The new-volume-script= script is now called at the end
    of _every tape_, even at the last one. This now allows to
    have a script that automatically renames a standard archive
    name into numbered archive names when a tree should be
    splitted into chunks.
  * star: In "pax" command line mode, star now uses -no-fsync as
    default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 20 11:11:10 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to relesae 2019.11.11
  * star: When using star -copy, the default is now
    -no-secure-links. This is what users like since they are
    copying their own data that per definition cannot be
    untrusted external data.
  * star: star -diff is now "more smooth" to use, when the
    archive type is GNU TAR and the "atime" or "ctime" properties
    are not present for a specific file. Before, Jan 1 1970 was
    the assumed time in the archive.
  * star: star -diff now prints a diff statistics summary.
  * SCCS: Added a new delta type 'U' that allows to tell get(1)
    to remove the g-file. Such SCCS history files are going to be
    used as placeholders for removed files in the upcomming
    project mode.
  * SCCS: admin now has a new option -Xunlink. It can be used
    together with -n to create special SCCS history files that
    remove the g-file on extraction if a delta is to be extracted
    that is of type 'U'.
  * SCCS: get now honors delta table entries that use the new 'U'
    delta type and removed non-writable g-files on extraction.
    This feature only works if the history file is in SCCS V6
    mode.
  * SCCS: a new option -Xmail=address allows admin(1) and delta(1)
    to add an email address to the delta meta data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 26 12:11:10 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2019.10.25
  * libfind: The recent changes to support "find dir/name -name
    name" did not work with -depth because the name base index
    needs a reset after processing the directory content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  8 16:06:28 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2019.10.07
  * Fixed infinite recursion of following symlinks in libschily/resolvepath.c.
  * smake: The error message for failed shell commands has been
    modified to "Code %d (%s) from command line..." in order to
    cause less confusion with the text printed by smake.
  * bosh: introduced shared memory to be able to forward the
    special exit cause (NOTFOUND or NOEXEC) to the parent even in
    case it used fork() instead of vfork().
  * bosh: Added support for a new automatic parameter "$/" to
    complement the existing parameter "$?".
  * star: The option -no-secure-links now may be configured as a
    global default via the tag STAR_SECURE_LINKS= in the file
    /etc/default/star and as a private default via an environment
    of the same name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 24 15:42:42 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.08.13
  * mkisofs: The struct attrinfo in apple.h has been enhanced by the
    struct members objid_low, objid_high, rsrc_length.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 16:46:46 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.07.22
  * The smake man page now mentions -N,-T,-u,-w,-j,-m-R
  * smake: fixed a potential crash when printing current directory
  * smake: implemented the -C option for gmake compatibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 17:42:58 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Disable LTO: mkisofs makes weird memory accesses otherwise
  (boo#1141188).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 14 07:18:30 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.06.13
  * cdrecord: The manpage now lists all supported media types and
    which media types are preferred over others.
  * star 1.6.1: fixed a bug in the FIFO code where star reported "star:
    Implementation botch: with FIFO_MEOF" as the tar side of the
    FIFO did sometimes not wait for the FIFO_IWAIT state when
    called as "star -multivolume -tv f=... f=... ..."
  * bsh: When expanding file names, the directory entries "." and
    ".." are now skipped and not part of the results. This is to
    make bsh to behave similar to the Bourne Shell with respect
    to globbing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Jun  2 07:30:57 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.05.28
  * SCCS: man page and help text updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 19:08:02 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.04.29
  * cdda2wav: The read Fallback-C2 funcion that tries to read
    with the better Sony SCSI commands did not correctly fall
    back to the MMC-C2 read function, which has been fixed.
  * readcd: a new option spt=# allows to limit the number of
    sectors per transfer for testing purposes.
  * Bourne Shell: "trap -- ..." now correctly handles "--" even
    if the next argument is "-".
  * Bourne Shell: trap now supports a new option -p that allows
    to restore the whole trap state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 10:52:01 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.03.29
  * Bourne Shell: "readonly", "export" and "local" now expand
    the tilde.
  * star: several forgotten fields of the tar header now support
    base-256 encoding.
  * star: support for new BSD and Linux file flags has been added.
  * star: The old star format no longer causes a warning when
    plain files from *BSD are imported on a UNIX with contiguous
    minor device bits.
  * star: Support for the "lzma" and "freeze2" compression has
    been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 08:49:52 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Add Conflict markers for file-based conflicts identified
  by repo-checker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 10:09:54 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.03.11
  * star: Support for base-256 numbers in timestamps and UID/GID
    has been added. This has been planned in the 1990s already,
    when star invented the base-256 coding, but it has been
    forgotten in favor of the POSIX.1-2001 enhanded archive
    headers. Now it seems that GNU tar that copied the format
    from star uses it for timestamps and UID/GID and we need to
    implement it in order to get archive compatibility.
  * star: star did print archives with illegal 32 byte user/group
    names (where the NUL terminator is missing) "correctly", when
    in list mode but it used only the first 31 bytes when
    extractig such archives.
  * star: Creating multi volume archives without using the FIFO
    did dump core.
  * star: Creating multi volume archives without POSIX.1-2001
    support no longer sets POSIX.1-2001 extension flags for the
    volume header.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 20 18:42:13 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.02.18
  * star 1.6: Two more FIFO problems (mainly visible on Linux)
    have been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 24 09:08:27 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.01.22
  * star: fixes for a hang and pipe reading issues
  * star: The debug printing for the FIFO has been enhanced to
    print more information from the FIFO control structure to
    debug problems like the ones mentioned above.
  * star now ignores SIGPIPE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  6 18:38:56 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.12.06
  * sccs-prs now prints the SCCS v6 initial path using the new
    keyword :Gp:.
  * sccs-prs now prints the SCCS v6 unified random using the new
    keyword :Gr:.
  * sccs: libcomobj: A parser for the SCCS v6 flags has been added.
  * sccs: libcomobj: A parser for SCCS v6 global meta data has
    been added.
- Package sccs.

- Package bsh, pfbsh symlinks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 19:09:47 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.11.22
  * include/schily/getopt.h: A new include file has been created
    for our libgetopt that includes an enhanced getopt()
    implementation.
  * libschily: resolvenpath() did not work as expected when some
    path names do not exist. A stat() call that should check
    whether we already reached the "/" directory caused a return
    (-1) even with (flags & RSPF_EXIST) == 0. This bug caused
    star to classify more symlinks as dangerous than needed.
- Remove schily-linker.diff (resolved upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  8 09:32:40 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim SELINUX from schily-2018-05-25_star_configuration.patch,
  it is already determined by %configure now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  6 16:33:45 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.10.30
  * bsh/Bourne Shell/star: a very long path name could cause a
    core dump with a "chdir()" operation in some cases.
  * star: "star -c H=exustar -pax-o binary" now correctly results in
    unencoded strings for uname/gname/path/linkpath.
  * star: a new option -no-secure-links allows to disable the secure
    default behavior.

    struct m_head. This should help to avoid specific
    optimization from newer compilers that could cause problems
    with the synchronization of the fifo.

    code if it is interupted by Ctrl-C.
  * star: Added new code to allow to debug a hanging FIFO.

    set from the POSIX 2001 extended tar headers in case that a
    name appears in that extended meta data.
