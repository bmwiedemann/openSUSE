Wed Nov 20 11:11:10 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to relesae 2019.11.11
  * star: When using star -copy, the default is now
    -no-secure-links. This is what users like since they are
    copying their own data that per definition cannot be
    untrusted external data.
  * star: star -diff is now "more smooth" to use, when the
    archive type is GNU TAR and the "atime" or "ctime" properties
    are not present for a specific file. Before, Jan 1 1970 was
    the assumed time in the archive.
  * star: star -diff now prints a diff statistics summary.
  * SCCS: Added a new delta type 'U' that allows to tell get(1)
    to remove the g-file. Such SCCS history files are going to be
    used as placeholders for removed files in the upcomming
    project mode.
  * SCCS: admin now has a new option -Xunlink. It can be used
    together with -n to create special SCCS history files that
    remove the g-file on extraction if a delta is to be extracted
    that is of type 'U'.
  * SCCS: get now honors delta table entries that use the new 'U'
    delta type and removed non-writable g-files on extraction.
    This feature only works if the history file is in SCCS V6
    mode.
  * SCCS: a new option -Xmail=address allows admin(1) and delta(1)
    to add an email address to the delta meta data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 26 12:11:10 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2019.10.25
  * libfind: The recent changes to support "find dir/name -name
    name" did not work with -depth because the name base index
    needs a reset after processing the directory content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  8 16:06:28 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 2019.10.07
  * Fixed infinite recursion of following symlinks in libschily/resolvepath.c.
  * smake: The error message for failed shell commands has been
    modified to "Code %d (%s) from command line..." in order to
    cause less confusion with the text printed by smake.
  * bosh: introduced shared memory to be able to forward the
    special exit cause (NOTFOUND or NOEXEC) to the parent even in
    case it used fork() instead of vfork().
  * bosh: Added support for a new automatic parameter "$/" to
    complement the existing parameter "$?".
  * star: The option -no-secure-links now may be configured as a
    global default via the tag STAR_SECURE_LINKS= in the file
    /etc/default/star and as a private default via an environment
    of the same name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 24 15:42:42 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.08.13
  * mkisofs: The struct attrinfo in apple.h has been enhanced by the
    struct members objid_low, objid_high, rsrc_length.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 12 16:46:46 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.07.22
  * The smake man page now mentions -N,-T,-u,-w,-j,-m-R
  * smake: fixed a potential crash when printing current directory
  * smake: implemented the -C option for gmake compatibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 17:42:58 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Disable LTO: mkisofs makes weird memory accesses otherwise
  (boo#1141188).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 14 07:18:30 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.06.13
  * cdrecord: The manpage now lists all supported media types and
    which media types are preferred over others.
  * star 1.6.1: fixed a bug in the FIFO code where star reported "star:
    Implementation botch: with FIFO_MEOF" as the tar side of the
    FIFO did sometimes not wait for the FIFO_IWAIT state when
    called as "star -multivolume -tv f=... f=... ..."
  * bsh: When expanding file names, the directory entries "." and
    ".." are now skipped and not part of the results. This is to
    make bsh to behave similar to the Bourne Shell with respect
    to globbing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Jun  2 07:30:57 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.05.28
  * SCCS: man page and help text updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  2 19:08:02 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.04.29
  * cdda2wav: The read Fallback-C2 funcion that tries to read
    with the better Sony SCSI commands did not correctly fall
    back to the MMC-C2 read function, which has been fixed.
  * readcd: a new option spt=# allows to limit the number of
    sectors per transfer for testing purposes.
  * Bourne Shell: "trap -- ..." now correctly handles "--" even
    if the next argument is "-".
  * Bourne Shell: trap now supports a new option -p that allows
    to restore the whole trap state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 10:52:01 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.03.29
  * Bourne Shell: "readonly", "export" and "local" now expand
    the tilde.
  * star: several forgotten fields of the tar header now support
    base-256 encoding.
  * star: support for new BSD and Linux file flags has been added.
  * star: The old star format no longer causes a warning when
    plain files from *BSD are imported on a UNIX with contiguous
    minor device bits.
  * star: Support for the "lzma" and "freeze2" compression has
    been added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 16 08:49:52 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Add Conflict markers for file-based conflicts identified
  by repo-checker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 10:09:54 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.03.11
  * star: Support for base-256 numbers in timestamps and UID/GID
    has been added. This has been planned in the 1990s already,
    when star invented the base-256 coding, but it has been
    forgotten in favor of the POSIX.1-2001 enhanded archive
    headers. Now it seems that GNU tar that copied the format
    from star uses it for timestamps and UID/GID and we need to
    implement it in order to get archive compatibility.
  * star: star did print archives with illegal 32 byte user/group
    names (where the NUL terminator is missing) "correctly", when
    in list mode but it used only the first 31 bytes when
    extractig such archives.
  * star: Creating multi volume archives without using the FIFO
    did dump core.
  * star: Creating multi volume archives without POSIX.1-2001
    support no longer sets POSIX.1-2001 extension flags for the
    volume header.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 20 18:42:13 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.02.18
  * star 1.6: Two more FIFO problems (mainly visible on Linux)
    have been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 24 09:08:27 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2019.01.22
  * star: fixes for a hang and pipe reading issues
  * star: The debug printing for the FIFO has been enhanced to
    print more information from the FIFO control structure to
    debug problems like the ones mentioned above.
  * star now ignores SIGPIPE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  6 18:38:56 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.12.06

    keyword :Gp:.
  * sccs-prs now prints the SCCS v6 unified random using the new
    keyword :Gr:.
  * sccs: libcomobj: A parser for the SCCS v6 flags has been added.
  * sccs: libcomobj: A parser for SCCS v6 global meta data has
    been added.
- Package sccs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 25 16:42:28 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Package bsh, pfbsh symlinks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 19:09:47 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.11.22
  * include/schily/getopt.h: A new include file has been created
    for our libgetopt that includes an enhanced getopt()
    implementation.
  * libschily: resolvenpath() did not work as expected when some
    path names do not exist. A stat() call that should check
    whether we already reached the "/" directory caused a return
    (-1) even with (flags & RSPF_EXIST) == 0. This bug caused
    star to classify more symlinks as dangerous than needed.
- Remove schily-linker.diff (resolved upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  8 09:32:40 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim SELINUX from schily-2018-05-25_star_configuration.patch,
  it is already determined by %configure now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  6 16:33:45 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2018.10.30
  * bsh/Bourne Shell/star: a very long path name could cause a
    core dump with a "chdir()" operation in some cases.
  * star: "star -c H=exustar -pax-o binary" now correctly results in
    unencoded strings for uname/gname/path/linkpath.
  * star: a new option -no-secure-links allows to disable the secure
    default behavior.
  * Changes to libfind options like -mount/-xdev and -perm;
    for details, see the AN-* files in the documentation directory.
  * New libfind primaries -chatime, -chctime, -chfile, -chown, etc.
    see AN-* for details.
  * star: Added "volatile" to a selection of struct members in
    struct m_head. This should help to avoid specific
    optimization from newer compilers that could cause problems
    with the synchronization of the fifo.
  * star: make sure that "star -c" results in a non-zero exit
    code if it is interupted by Ctrl-C.
  * star: Added new code to allow to debug a hanging FIFO.
  * star: the path name length and the link name length are now
    set from the POSIX 2001 extended tar headers in case that a
    name appears in that extended meta data.
- Removed schily-2018-05-25_star_lock.patch (no longer needed).
- Added schily-linker.diff.
- Add smake and ved subpackages.

  * star: dotdot atacks are now also detected if they are based
    on DOS filesystem semantics.

    program.
  * star: A hard EOF on input now results in a non-zero exit code.
  * star: Now defaults to use "ssh" for the remote tape interface.
  * star: There is now a way to make -no-fsync the default
    behavior to avoid slow operation on platforms with slow
    buffer cache.
  * librmt: added a way to configure the remote shell and the
    remote tape server path.
  * star: support for unlimited file path length.
  * libschily: a new set of gt*() and fgt*() functions with
    gettext() support have been added.
  * Bourne Shell: avoid a core dump with missing HOME.
  * libfind: added a new primary "-call" that allows to call back
    into the program instead of calling exec().
  * libfind: new primaries -newerat, -newermt, -newerct.

- Update to new upstream release 2018.05.17
  * smake: Now using TYPE_MAXVAL(time_t) in gnewtime() instead of
    the method from 1996, to work around a problem with gcc-8.1
    and clang-6.0.
  * mkisofs: The link count computation did incorrectly count all
    directory entries for large (multi extent) files. This
    resulted in a link count that was "real number" + (sizeof
    file / 2GB)
  * mkisofs: File meta data for UDF directories that refer to a
    Rock Ridge relocated directory had been emitted as all
    zeroes.
  * star: nanosecond timestamp support

  but seems to require one that it doesn't use. Fix it uses no
  parameters. (bnc#1084893)
- Always install to /usr/lib/siconv since otherwise mkisofs doesn't
  find charsets. Needs to be fixed properly later. (bnc#1084892)

  * mkisofs: mkisofs now reserves more space for the file names
    to avoid a path buffer overrun
  * mkisofs: fixed a bug that caused to put more than one UDF
    direcory entry for a file in case that the file is a ISO-0660
    multi-segment file.
  * mkisofs: fixed a bug that caused the wrong start sector address
    to be used for UDF in case that the file is a ISO-9660
    multi-segment file and the -sort option was used.
  * libschily: libschily::fexecv() now allows to use the parameter
    "ac" with the value -1 to indicate that the arg count is to be
    determined by the NULL pointer at the end of the arg list
  * new include files include/schily/err_*.h are used to
    encapsulate #error CPP statements that would otherwise always
    prevent compilation with K&R compilers
  * mkisofs: new option -ignore-error alows to continue on some
    errors
  * mkisofs: Avoid a 32 bit integer overflow while computing sector
    addresses for Rock Ridge CE entries

  around the vendor ID strings in order to avoid incorrect buffer
  overflow warnings from GCC-4.x
  * mkisofs: while introducing the new option -modification-date,
  we did accidently remove the code to set up the creation date
  in te PVD. Now creation date again contains correct data.
