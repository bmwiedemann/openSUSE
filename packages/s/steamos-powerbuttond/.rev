    <comment>The package used in https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/steam-powerbuttond has been archived by the original author and he links to this package now. Therefore, I'm submitting this package to replace it. I submit it to Factory now, so steam-powerbuttond can be removed. Is the replacement logic using provides and obsoletes correct?</comment>
