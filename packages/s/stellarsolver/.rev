    <comment>- Update to 1.8:
  * it is now possible to use the external astrometry.net
    local solver without it needing to invoke python
  * fixes and improvements wrt astrometry.net
  * protect against malformed subframes that might lead to crashes
  * fix parity calculations for ASTAP and Local Astrometry.net

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 2.2:
  * fix valgrind issues
  * improve memory management
  * correcting downsample in WCSData
- Update to 2.1:
  * fix for watney solver
  * remove wrong options from watney solver
  * add ability to abort on internal star extraction
  * detect ASTAP in /usr/bin
  * add support for saving results
  * avoid name conflict in includes in Kstars
  * fix crash that may happen during logging
  * fix solver paths
- Update to 2.0:
  * Eliminating the last external files: solved and cancel files from the internal solver
  * Making an interface between the C++ and astrometry.net logging that works well to fix logging issues
  * Making StellarSolver easier to use in a blocking way, including using it as a C++ temporary object
  * Making the convolution filter easier to generate and use as well as adding more types of filters
  * Significantly reducing the astrometry code needed for the solver
  * Adding support for a new external solver: the Watney Astrometry Solver
  * Improving the abort code so that it shuts down faster
  * Adding a number of demos to show how to use StellarSolver
  * Adding healpix and index series hints so that you can speed up solves in localized areas based on former solves
  * Making it possible to run two stellar solvers simultaneously
  * Adding some new options for star extraction
  * Making API simplifications
  * Fixing some memory leaks and other warnings on various operating systems
  * Removing some unused code
- Remove fix-version.patch

  * Adding an abort and wait function that will wait synchronously, if desired.
  * Add parallel abort support.
  * Preventing program freezes and improving messages.

    <comment>- Update to 2.5:
  * The keyword used for ASTAP parity was updated since some images were getting the opposite parity due to an issue with the other keyword.
  * The Online flip for astrometry was removed since it was not needed anymore.
  * The he URL for Online astrometry was updated as well.
