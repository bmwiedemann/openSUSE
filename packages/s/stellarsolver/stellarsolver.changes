Thu Mar  3 07:37:02 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.0:
  * Eliminating the last external files: solved and cancel files from the internal solver
  * Making an interface between the C++ and astrometry.net logging that works well to fix logging issues
  * Making StellarSolver easier to use in a blocking way, including using it as a C++ temporary object

  * Significantly reducing the astrometry code needed for the solver
  * Adding support for a new external solver: the Watney Astrometry Solver
  * Improving the abort code so that it shuts down faster
  * Adding a number of demos to show how to use StellarSolver
