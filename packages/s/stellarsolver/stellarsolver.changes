Thu Mar  3 07:37:02 UTC 2022 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.0:
  * Eliminating the last external files: solved and cancel files from the internal solver
  * Making an interface between the C++ and astrometry.net logging that works well to fix logging issues
  * Making StellarSolver easier to use in a blocking way, including using it as a C++ temporary object
  * Making the convolution filter easier to generate and use as well as adding more types of filters
  * Significantly reducing the astrometry code needed for the solver
  * Adding support for a new external solver: the Watney Astrometry Solver
  * Improving the abort code so that it shuts down faster
  * Adding a number of demos to show how to use StellarSolver
  * Adding healpix and index series hints so that you can speed up solves in localized areas based on former solves
  * Making it possible to run two stellar solvers simultaneously
  * Adding some new options for star extraction
  * Making API simplifications
  * Fixing some memory leaks and other warnings on various operating systems
  * Removing some unused code
