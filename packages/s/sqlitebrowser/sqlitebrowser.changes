Tue Aug 29 16:59:44 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- update to version 3.10.0
  * Highlights
    - DBHub.io integration
      + Uploading and downloading of databases works
      + Branching, forking, starring works, as does creating tags and releases
      + There's a 100MB per database limit at the moment though, as it's still in development
      + Backups aren't done on it (yet), so don't use it as your only place for storing important things (!!!)
      + The front page is... not great. We're working on it.
      + Still lots of upcoming stuff needing to be done. An API to query your databases, a cli, merging, discussions/issues
      + Please report bugs, ideas, suggestions (etc) on the dbhub.io repo issue tracker as you find them.
    - Many plot improvements (NULL values, progress dialog, remember settings, better colours, and bug fixes)
    - Better table editing (foreign key editor, toggling the WITHOUT ROWID flag, temporary tables, ...)
    - Better Import CSV dialog. It can now handle multiple CSV files at once
    - Improved Index dialog and better index handling in general
    - Better handling of virtual tables
    - Filter improvements (ranges, NULL search)
    - The usual improvements to the grammar parser
