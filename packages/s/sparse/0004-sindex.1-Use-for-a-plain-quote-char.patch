Subject: sindex.1: Use ' for a plain quote char

Patch-mainline: maint-v0.6.2 branch
References: maint-v0.6.2

lintian (a linter for Debian packages) warns:

N:    This manual page uses the \' groff sequence. Usually, the intent to
N:    generate an apostrophe, but that sequence actually renders as a an acute
N:    accent.
N:
N:    For an apostrophe or a single closing quote, use plain '. For single
N:    opening quote, i.e. a straight downward line ' like the one used in
N:    shell commands, use &#92;(aq.

I'm not following its advice but stick to ' as is done in other places
of sindex.1.
