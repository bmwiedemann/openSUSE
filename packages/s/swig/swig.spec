%description
SWIG is a compiler that attempts to make it easy to integrate C, C++,
or Objective-C code with scripting languages including Perl, Tcl, and
Python.  In a nutshell, you give it a bunch of ANSI C/C++ declarations
and it generates an interface between C and your favorite scripting
language.  However, this is only scratching the surface of what SWIG
can do--some of its more advanced features include automatic
documentation generation, module and library management, extensive
customization options, and more.
