-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 18 07:57:14 UTC 2022 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- %sysusers_create_inline was wrongly marked as deprecated

- %sysusers_create can be useful in certain cases and won't go away until we'll
  move to file triggers. So don't mark it as deprecated too

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 12:28:16 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 14

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 17 12:25:15 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Introduce %_systemd_util_dir

  It's a backport of upstream commit 3bc66bfa0136e370a8f7b06c3b69a52f5636ef82.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 29 11:27:11 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %{load:} instead of %{?load:}: fix build with RPM 4.17.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 30 09:59:31 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump to version 13

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 30 09:52:48 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Make use of "Suggests:" in %systemd_ordering

  Until libzypp supports "OrderWithRequires:", we need to specify a
  similar ordering constraint that can be understood by the dep solver
  as well. Hence the use of "Suggests:" in %systemd_ordering
  (workaround for bsc#1187332).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 20 10:18:23 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump to version 12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 20 09:54:00 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Introduce %sysusers_create_package

  %sysusers_create and %sysusers_create_inline are now deprecated and
  the new macro should be used instead.

  Upstream commit 07a7d4a0040d221ff09e527e91c112b4ffab1dba.

- Introduce %tmpfiles_create_package

  %%tmpfiles_create is now deprecreated and the new macros should be
  used instead.

  Upstream commit 0f78fee8d039000b987848a558fbaa15d916e14e.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 20 09:45:11 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- %sysusers_create_inline: use here-docs instead of echo (bsc#1186282)

  Upstream commit dd2490ae12ad1e1795ecbf8f8944b950da9c8d06.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  5 12:27:14 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump to version 11

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  5 11:10:16 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Don't pass -f to rm in %service_add_post nor %systemd_user_post

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  5 11:03:49 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add a %systemd_user_pre macro that creates a
  /run/systemd/rpm/needs-user-preset/$service file for each new
  service being installed so %systemd_user_post can call
  `systemctl --global preset $service` properly for newly
  installed user services (boo#1183051, boo#1183012).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  4 13:11:15 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Fix %systemd_user_post. The --global parameter was handled as if
  it was another service name so %systemd_user_post wasn't working
  properly. Replace %systemd_user_post with the code from
  %service_add_post it was being expanded to but correctly passing
  --global to systemctl (boo#1183051, boo#1182661).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 11:46:17 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 10

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 11:02:57 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Make upstream %systemd_{pre,post,preun,postun} aliases to their SUSE
  counterparts

  Packagers can now choose to use the upstream or the SUSE variants
  indifferently. For consistency the SUSE variants should be preferred
  since almost all SUSE packages already use them but the upstream
  versions might be usefull in certain cases where packages need to
  support multiple distros based on RPM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 10:23:35 UTC 2021 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Improve the logic used to apply the presets (bsc#1177039)

  Before presests were applied at a) package installation b) new units
  introduced via a package update (but after making sure that it was
  not a SysV initscript being converted).

  The problem is that a) didn't handle package a renaming or split
  properly since the package with the new name is installed rather
  being updated and therefore the presets were applied even if they
  were already with the old name.

  We now cover this case (and the other ones) by applying presets only
  if the units are new and the services are not being migrated. This
  regardless of whether this happens during an install or an update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 20:33:21 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 9

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 16:48:05 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- daemon-reload is not needed in %service_add_post

  Applying presets, ie enabling/disabling units, doesn't require to
  update units loaded in PID1 memory. It's actually needed after and
  it's done implicitly by `systemctl preset`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 06:34:57 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Rename the tag file used to detect when presets need to be applied

  Rather than placing these tags directly under /run, let's place them
  under /run/systemd/rpm. This also has the benefit to make the
  workaround for bsc#1059627 no more needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 19 15:53:43 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- %service_del_preun doesn't accept -f/-n options anymore

  The few package calling %service_del_preun with '-f' or '-n' option
  have been fixed. These options are not needed anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 11:21:44 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 8

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 09:32:31 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Introduce %service_del_postun_with_restart()

  It's the counterpart of %service_del_postun_without_restart() and
  replaces the '-f' option of %service_del_postun().

- Expand %service_del_postun_without_restart in %service_del_postun

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 10 09:13:03 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Add a missing space in %_restart_on_update()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 11:38:23 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 7

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 11:36:56 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Dont apply presets when migrating from a disabled initscript (bsc#1178481)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 08:47:04 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 07:58:01 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Test for the presence of systemd only once in %service_add_post

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 07:44:40 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- No need to run 'systemd-sysv-convert --save' in %service_add_pre anymore

  Due to the fact that the initscripts being removed during package
  updates are still available in %post, systemd-sysv-convert has been
  reworked so it's only needed to call it in %post.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 07:35:12 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Make rpmbuild load our own macros.systemd to import %{%_unitdir} properly

  Ideally we should also own other %{_*dir} paths...

- Stop owning /usr/lib/systemd directory as no package other than
  systemd is supposed to put files there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 14:36:43 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- DISABLE_RESTART_ON_UDPATE is no more read from the (build) environment

  %service_del_postun_without_restart is the interface that should be
  used by packages that need to prevent theirs services from being
  restarted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 17:39:01 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 5

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 17:37:54 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop DISABLE_STOP_ON_REMOVAL support (jsc#SLE-8968)

  %service_del_preun still accepts '-n' and '-f' options to keep
  backward compatibility with SLE (as some packages share the same
  devel project between SLE and openSUSE) but these options are now
  ignored on Factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 09:25:44 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 4.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 25 00:48:04 UTC 2020 - Neal Gompa <ngompa13@gmail.com>

- Sync missing macros of directory paths from upstream systemd macros
  + %_environmentdir
  + %_modulesloaddir
  + %_modprobedir

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 08:17:25 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- $1 can never be empty or it's an rpm bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 08:03:45 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Get rid of $FIRST_ARG

  $FIRST_ARG was probably introduced because the %service_* macros
  were playing tricks on the shell positional parameters. This is bad
  practice and error prone so let's assume that no macros should do
  that anymore and hence it's safe to assume that positional
  parameters remains unchanged after any rpm macro call.

  All users of $FIRST_ARG should have been fixed by now and in most
  cases the use of the variable was unneeded (since the macros don't
  change the shell parameters) and thus confusing.

  'net-snmp' has a different use of FIRST_ARG though as it tried to
  fake an update during a package installation. Fortunately this could
  have been fixed too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 08:18:07 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Fix %_restart_on_update_force: drop one extra trailing '}'

  Thanks Werner for spotting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 17:43:13 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Simplify %_restart_on_update and %_stop_on_removal

  There's no need to spawn sub shells when these macros are used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 16:57:04 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Macros arguments are mandatory

  Especially in %_restart_on_update_never and %_stop_on_removal_never,
  let's assume that they always receive unit names as arguments. This
  allows to make them slightly simpler (less rpm macro black magic).

  Callers will fail earlier if no arguments are passed anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 14:13:28 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Make sure %_restart_on_update_never and %_stop_on_removal_never
  don't expand to the empty string

  Otherwise sequences like the following would result in incorrect
  shell syntax:

  if [ ]; then
     %_restart_on_update_never
  fi

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 12:17:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Restore one daemon-reload command

  It was erroneously removed during the drop of $YAST_IS_RUNNING.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 25 09:55:28 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 22 13:00:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Introduce %service_del_postun_without_restart

  This is another step to make the SUSE rpm macros closer to their
  upstream counterparts.

  Introduce %service_del_postun_without_restart which should help in
  getting rid of '-f' and '-n' switches of %service_del_postun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 21 17:53:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop $YAST_IS_RUNNING in favor of $SYSTEMD_OFFLINE (bsc#1117489)

  libzypp now kindly defines SYSTEMD_OFFLINE when appropriate (see
  bsc#1118758). Therefore we don't need to rely on YAST_IS_RUNNING
  anymore. It's a tiny step to make the SUSE macros closer to their
  upstream counterparts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 12:08:30 UTC 2018 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- systemd-sysv-convert has been moved from /usr/sbin to /usr/lib/systemd

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 22 12:54:45 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- remove confusing --user before --global

  Backport from
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/28d36da64a7a23a55e8d0a139f2620384fd058b3.

  This was spotted in bsc#1090785.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 14 14:04:19 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- Fix %systemd_post(): it's never called during package removal

  Also make it useful by restoring its original implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 16:56:37 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- Import more definitions from upstream (v237)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix system_user_post macro for usage with RPM 4.14, backport from
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/e67ba783.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 08:39:15 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Move macros.systemd in /usr/lib/rpm

  The file is not supposed to be customized by the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 17:14:25 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make %systemd_add_pre() more similar to %systemd_add_post()

  The main advantage is that we pass only one argument to
  systemd-sysv-convert script. The later can now be improved/rewritten
  to handle only one argument and return a useful exit status.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 16:42:56 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make sure to apply presets if packages start shipping units during upgrades (bsc#1071543)

  If a package started shipping units during upgrade only sysv
  migration was done. However if the package didn't ship any sysv
  scripts before no presets were applied.

  Now during upgrades, preset are always applied (still only during
  the first time the units are installed) then followed by the sysv
  migration machinery.

  The downside of this is that migrated services can have symlinks in
  both runlevel.target.wants/ (created by the sysv migration) and in
  the directory specified by the [Install] sections (created by
  "systemctl preset")...

  The whole thing should be rewritten.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 10:47:29 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make sure to clean up "new-in-upgrade" tag file (bsc#1059627)

  The tag file might have been incorrectly left by a preceding update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Restore previous changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 17 09:23:14 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Revert previous changes

  Also added reasons why the previous changes would be needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 17 07:44:55 CET 2017 - kukuk@suse.de

- Don't execute systemd-tmpfiles if we run in transactional update
  mode

  If you do transactional updates, it doesn't make any sense to
  execute the tmpfiles. They will only create a lot of directories,
  files or symlinks in empty directories without any use and later
  hidden under the real mount points. With transactional updates, you
  should do such things always during the boot phase, as designed by
  systemd (and like Fedora and RHEL doing, but in their use case it's
  in my opinion a bug).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  2 16:09:29 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Remove a useless test in %service_add_pre()

  The test was placed where the condition '[ "$FIRST_ARG" -gt 1 ]' was
  always true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  2 09:59:37 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- BuildIgnore systemd-rpm-macros: a small cycle that can be
  avoided. system-rpm-macros is being pulled in by rpm-build as
  conveniance to the packagers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  2 09:31:50 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Reference bsc#956849 to please the new OBS 'sanity' check (bsc#1041386)

  %tmpfiles_create is already part of the version shipped by Factory
  so there's nothing to do here execpt mentioning (bsc#956849).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 11:54:11 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Kill preset macros

  The last users have been fixed so these macros are no more used by
  any package.

  The introduction of them was a bad idea and only the branding preset
  package is still using a similar mechanism but at least it's now
  self contained in this package. Also the package calls now a shell
  script instead of rpm macros.

  Upstream is working on making this completely obsolete so the preset
  branding package could be cleaned up for good.
