- Sync missing macros of directory paths from upstream systemd macros
  + %_environmentdir
  + %_modulesloaddir
  + %_modprobedir

- $1 can never be empty or it's an rpm bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 12 08:03:45 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Get rid of $FIRST_ARG

  $FIRST_ARG was probably introduced because the %service_* macros
  were playing tricks on the shell positional parameters. This is bad
  practice and error prone so let's assume that no macros should do
  that anymore and hence it's safe to assume that positional
  parameters remains unchanged after any rpm macro call.

  All users of $FIRST_ARG should have been fixed by now and in most
  cases the use of the variable was unneeded (since the macros don't
  change the shell parameters) and thus confusing.

  'net-snmp' has a different use of FIRST_ARG though as it tried to
  fake an update during a package installation. Fortunately this could
  have been fixed too.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 08:18:07 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Fix %_restart_on_update_force: drop one extra trailing '}'

  Thanks Werner for spotting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 17:43:13 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Simplify %_restart_on_update and %_stop_on_removal

  There's no need to spawn sub shells when these macros are used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 16:57:04 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Macros arguments are mandatory

  Especially in %_restart_on_update_never and %_stop_on_removal_never,
  let's assume that they always receive unit names as arguments. This
  allows to make them slightly simpler (less rpm macro black magic).

  Callers will fail earlier if no arguments are passed anyway.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 14:13:28 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Make sure %_restart_on_update_never and %_stop_on_removal_never
  don't expand to the empty string

  Otherwise sequences like the following would result in incorrect
  shell syntax:

  if [ ]; then
     %_restart_on_update_never
  fi

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 27 12:17:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Restore one daemon-reload command

  It was erroneously removed during the drop of $YAST_IS_RUNNING.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 25 09:55:28 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Bump version to 4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 22 13:00:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Introduce %service_del_postun_without_restart

  This is another step to make the SUSE rpm macros closer to their
  upstream counterparts.

  Introduce %service_del_postun_without_restart which should help in
  getting rid of '-f' and '-n' switches of %service_del_postun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 21 17:53:18 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop $YAST_IS_RUNNING in favor of $SYSTEMD_OFFLINE (bsc#1117489)

  libzypp now kindly defines SYSTEMD_OFFLINE when appropriate (see
  bsc#1118758). Therefore we don't need to rely on YAST_IS_RUNNING
  anymore. It's a tiny step to make the SUSE macros closer to their
  upstream counterparts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 23 12:08:30 UTC 2018 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- systemd-sysv-convert has been moved from /usr/sbin to /usr/lib/systemd

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 22 12:54:45 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- remove confusing --user before --global

  Backport from
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/28d36da64a7a23a55e8d0a139f2620384fd058b3.

  This was spotted in bsc#1090785.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 14 14:04:19 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- Fix %systemd_post(): it's never called during package removal

  Also make it useful by restoring its original implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 16:56:37 UTC 2018 - fbui@suse.com

- Import more definitions from upstream (v237)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 22 11:33:28 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Fix system_user_post macro for usage with RPM 4.14, backport from
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/e67ba783.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 14 08:39:15 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Move macros.systemd in /usr/lib/rpm

  The file is not supposed to be customized by the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 17:14:25 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make %systemd_add_pre() more similar to %systemd_add_post()

  The main advantage is that we pass only one argument to
  systemd-sysv-convert script. The later can now be improved/rewritten
  to handle only one argument and return a useful exit status.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 16:42:56 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make sure to apply presets if packages start shipping units during upgrades (bsc#1071543)

  If a package started shipping units during upgrade only sysv
  migration was done. However if the package didn't ship any sysv
  scripts before no presets were applied.

  Now during upgrades, preset are always applied (still only during
  the first time the units are installed) then followed by the sysv
  migration machinery.

  The downside of this is that migrated services can have symlinks in
  both runlevel.target.wants/ (created by the sysv migration) and in
  the directory specified by the [Install] sections (created by
  "systemctl preset")...

  The whole thing should be rewritten.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 10:47:29 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Make sure to clean up "new-in-upgrade" tag file (bsc#1059627)

  The tag file might have been incorrectly left by a preceding update.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 22 14:41:00 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Restore previous changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 17 09:23:14 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Revert previous changes

  Also added reasons why the previous changes would be needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 17 07:44:55 CET 2017 - kukuk@suse.de

- Don't execute systemd-tmpfiles if we run in transactional update
  mode

  If you do transactional updates, it doesn't make any sense to
  execute the tmpfiles. They will only create a lot of directories,
  files or symlinks in empty directories without any use and later
  hidden under the real mount points. With transactional updates, you
  should do such things always during the boot phase, as designed by
  systemd (and like Fedora and RHEL doing, but in their use case it's
  in my opinion a bug).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  2 16:09:29 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Remove a useless test in %service_add_pre()

  The test was placed where the condition '[ "$FIRST_ARG" -gt 1 ]' was
  always true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  2 09:59:37 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- BuildIgnore systemd-rpm-macros: a small cycle that can be
  avoided. system-rpm-macros is being pulled in by rpm-build as
  conveniance to the packagers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  2 09:31:50 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Reference bsc#956849 to please the new OBS 'sanity' check (bsc#1041386)

  %tmpfiles_create is already part of the version shipped by Factory
  so there's nothing to do here execpt mentioning (bsc#956849).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 11:54:11 UTC 2017 - fbui@suse.com

- Kill preset macros

  The last users have been fixed so these macros are no more used by
  any package.

  The introduction of them was a bad idea and only the branding preset
  package is still using a similar mechanism but at least it's now
  self contained in this package. Also the package calls now a shell
  script instead of rpm macros.

  Upstream is working on making this completely obsolete so the preset
  branding package could be cleaned up for good.

- Add %systemd_preset_pre and %systemd_preset_posttrans that will
  do one shot presetting of all services with changed system
  preset. It makes possible to to fix bad default service state
  (bnc#900935#c46, FATE#318949, FATE#317727, bnc#921075).
- Increment version to 3.
