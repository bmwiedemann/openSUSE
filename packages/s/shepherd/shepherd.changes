- Update to 0.10.1:
  * Major internal overhaul (in 0.9.x): usage of Guile Fibers to

    services

  * Configurable number of ‘bind’ attempts for endpoints
  * New ‘default-respawn-limit’ parameter
  * ‘herd restart SERVICE’ starts the replacement, not the original service
  * ‘herd restart SERVICE’ does not restart transient services
- remove no longer needed shepherd-rpmlintrc
- add shepherd.keyring for signature check
- dependent on guile-fibers
- support for Guile 2.0 was dropped (because of fibers requirements)
