%description
The GNU Daemon Shepherd or GNU Shepherd, formerly known as GNU dmd, is
a service manager that looks after the herd of system services. It
provides a replacement for the service-managing capabilities of
SysV-init (or any other init). It is intended
for use on GNU/Hurd, but it is supposed to work on every POSIX-like
system where Guile is available. In particular, it is used as PID 1 by
GNU Guix.
