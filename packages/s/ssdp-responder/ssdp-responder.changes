- Update to version 2.0
  Changes
  Add suport for 
  * -c NAME to override ssdpd UUID cache file.
  * -d URL to override the UPnP description URL, a single %s is
    supported to be replaced with the interface address.
  * -m NAME to override the manufacturer in the default
    description.xml.
  * -M URL to override the manufacturerURL in the default
    description.xml.
  * -p URL to override the presentationURL in the default
    description.xml, a single %s is supported.
  * -P FILE to override the default PID file location default
    description.xml, a single %s is supported.
  * -u UUID to use a custom UUID, useful when the built-in micro
    HTTP server is disabled.
  * -w to disable built-in micro HTTP server, useful when other,
    more capable, web servers are available. Make sure to have the
    alternate web server running on port 1901 to serve the file
    /description.xml, see also -d URL above, which details the
    location of the UPnP description URL.
  * Increased debug messages in ssdp_init(), for troubleshooting.
  * dropping root privileges after initial setup. The used ssdp
    is searched for first, with fallback to nobody.
  * Add support for an initial retry interval at startup, in
    case ssdpd is started before any interface has been configured.
    Configurable retry count using -R NUM command line option.
  * Add support for an IP address monitor using Linux netlink
    interfaces coming and going at runtime. Meaning, -R NUM is
    unused on Linux. For this to work, ssdpd must start as root or
    have CAP_NET_RAW.
  Fixes
  * Fix #11: periodic busy loop causing intermittent 100% CPU load.
  * Fix invalid <UDN>uuid:uuid:...</UDN> in description.xml.
  * Add Date: and Server: to HTTP header in micro HTTP server.
  * Add support for HTTP HEAD requests to micro HTTP server.
  * Handle case when /etc/os-release does not have VERSION_ID fall
    back to use VERSION_CODENAME.
  * Don't overwrite CPPFLAGS from the command line.
  * Portability fix to utimensat() replacement function.
