%description
ssdpd is a stand-alone daemon that implements the Simple Service
Discovery Protocol (SSDP) for use by networked Linux devices that
want to announce themselves to systems running Windows. ssdpd has a
built-in web server for serving the UPnP XML description which
Windows uses to present the icon when an InternetGatewayDevice is
announced.
