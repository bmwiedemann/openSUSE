  <title>Enjoy playing with Sudoku boards designed by yourself</title>
  <description>The engine solves sudokus by applying complex logical rules a few times,
instead of applying simpler rules (like guessing and backtracking)
many many times. These complex logical rules are exactly the same ones
that people use with paper and pen.</description>
