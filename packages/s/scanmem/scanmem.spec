%description
scanmem is a debugging utility designed to isolate the address of an
arbitrary variable in an executing process. scanmem simply needs to be told
the PID of the process, and the value of the variable at several different
times. After several scans of the process, scanmem isolates the position of
the variable and allows you to modify its value.
