Tue Dec  3 15:59:06 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- /usr/sbin/ipsec is deprecated since 5.2.0 and will be removed
  in the future.
- Update to release 6.0.0
  * Support for multiple IKEv2 key exchanges (RFC 9370)
  * Support for the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation
    Mechanism (ML-KEM, FIPS 203)
  * AF_VSOCK socket support
  * The file logger can optionally log messages as JSON objects
  * Handling of CHILD_SA rekey collisions has been improved
  * The kernel-netlink plugin explicitly configures the direction
    of IPsec SAs when running on 6.10+ kernels
  * The NetworkManager plugin (charon-nm) now uses a different
    routing table than the regular IKE daemon to avoid conflicts
    if both are running
  * The following crypto plugins are no longer built:
    aes, curve25519, des, fips-prf, gmp, hmac, md5, pkcs12, rc2,
    sha1, sha2. (Their replacement is the "openssl" plugin.)
  * The following deprecated plugins have been removed: bliss
    (signature scheme), newhope (key exchange method), ntru (key
    exchange method).
- Add init.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 26 12:02:16 UTC 2024 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- rename -hmac subpackage to -fips because it isn't providing
  the hmac files, it provides the configuration drop in to
  enforce fips mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 20 12:10:36 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update description of ipsec package: no longer mention
  /etc/init.d, which is not there for a long time anymore.
- Drop legacy rc* -> sbin/service symlink. This was compatibilty
  boilerplate to transparently move between SySV and systemd
  [jsc#PED-264].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 19 13:58:13 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.14
  * Support for the IKEv2 OCSP extensions (RFC 4806) has been
    added, which allows peers to request and send OCSP responses
    directly in IKEv2.
  * Validation of X.509 name constraints in the constraints plugin
    has been refactored to align with RFC 5280.
  * Fail SA installation on Linux if replay protection is disabled
    while ESN is enabled, which the kernel currently doesn't
    support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 26 13:31:08 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %patch -P N instead of deprecated %patchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  1 10:31:13 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.13
  * OCSP error responses are now dropped immediately instead of
    trying to verify a non-existent signature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 20 13:32:59 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.12
  * Fixed a buffer overflow in charon-tkm [CVEV-2023-41913]
  * Support for ``nameConstraints`` of type ``iPAddress`` are now
    supported by the "x509", "openssl" and "constraints" plugins
  * Support for encoding subjectAlternativeName extensions of type
    uniformResourceIdentifier in X.509 certificates has been added.
  * Make the NetworkManager plugin (charon-nm) actually use the
    XFRM interface it creates since 5.9.10. This involves setting
    interface IDs on SAs and policies, and installing routes via
    the interface. To avoid routing loops if the remote traffic
    selectors include the VPN server, IKE and ESP packets are
    marked to bypass the routing table that contains the routes via
    XFRM interface.
  * The kernel-libipsec plugin now always installs routes to remote
    networks even if no address is found in the local traffic
    selectors, which allows forwarding traffic from networks the
    VPN host is not part of.
  * Fixed issues while reestablishing multiple CHILD_SAs (e.g.
    after a DPD timeout) that could cause a reqid to get assigned
    to multiple CHILD_SAs with unrelated traffic selectors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 22 13:24:08 UTC 2023 - Mohd Saquib <mohd.saquib@suse.com>

- Removed .hmac files + hmac integrity check logic from strongswan-hmac
  package as it is not mandated anymore by FIPS (boo#1185116)
- Removed folliwng files:
  [- strongswan_fipscheck.patch]
  [- fipscheck.sh.in]
  Note: strongswan-hmac package is not removed as it still provides a
  config file that doesn't allow non-fips approved algorithms

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 12 15:54:53 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Remove pre-SLE15 build logic

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 12 15:22:09 UTC 2023 - Mohd Saquib <mohd.saquib@suse.com>

- Update to release 5.9.11
  * A deadlock in the vici plugin has been fixed
  * Per RFC 5280, CRLs now have to be signed by a certificate that
    either encodes the cRLSign keyUsage bit (even if it is a CA
    certificate), or is a CA certificate without a keyUsage
    extension.
  * Support for optional CA labels in EST server URIs was added to
    the pki --est and pki --estca commands.
  * The pkcs7 and openssl plugins now support CMS-style signatures
    in PKCS#7 containers, which allows verifying RSA-PSS and ECDSA
    signatures.
  * Fixed a regression in the server implementation of EAP-TLS when
    using TLS <=1.2.
  * The EAP-TLS client does now enforce that the TLS handshake is
    complete when using TLS <=1.2.
  * On Linux, the kernel-libipsec plugin can now optionally handle
    ESP packets without UDP encapsulation.
  * The dhcp plugin uses an alternative method to determine the
    source address when sending unicast DHCP requests.
  * ECDSA and EdDSA public keys are supported by the ipseckey
    plugin when parsing RFC 4025 IPSECKEY resource records.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  5 01:34:28 UTC 2023 - Mohd Saquib <mohd.saquib@suse.com>

- Allow to use stroke aka ipsec interface by default instead of
  vici aka swanctl interface which is current upstream's default.
  strongswan.service which enables swanctl interface is masked to
  stop interfering with the ipsec interface (bsc#1184144)
- Removes deprecated SysV support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  2 13:34:37 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.10
  * Fixed a vulnerability related to certificate verification in
    TLS-based EAP methods that leads to an authentication bypass
    followed by an expired pointer dereference that results in a
    denial of service but possibly even remote code execution.
    [CVE-2023-26463]
  * Added support for full packet hardware offload for IPsec SAs
    and policies, which has been introduced with the Linux 6.2
    kernel, to the kernel-netlink plugin. Bypass policies for the
    IKE ports are automatically offloaded to devices that support
    this type of offloading.
  * TLS-based EAP methods use the key derivation specified in
    draft-ietf-emu-tls-eap-types when used with TLS 1.3.
  * Routes via XFRM interfaces can now optionally be installed
    automatically by enabling the
    charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.install_routes_xfrmi option.
- If connections are missing in `ipsec status`, check that
  strongswan-starter.service (rather than strongswan.service)
  is active.
- Remove CVE-2023-26463_tls_auth_bypass_exp_pointer.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  2 12:26:39 UTC 2023 - Mohd Saquib <mohd.saquib@suse.com>

- Added patch to fix a vulnerability in incorrectly accepted
  untrusted public key with incorrect refcount
  (CVE-2023-26463 boo#1208608)
  [+ CVE-2023-26463_tls_auth_bypass_exp_pointer.patch]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  3 13:22:12 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.9
  * Fixed an issue that could cause OCSP requests to contain an
    incorrect serial number if the openssl plugin parsed the
    certificate.
  * The resolve plugin does not invoke resolvconf(8) with
    individual interface names for each name server anymore.
  * The kernel-netlink plugin now logs extended ACK error and
    warning messages provided by the Linux kernel if e.g. the
    installation of an SA or policy fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 20:36:03 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.8
  * Fixed a vulnerability related to online certificate
    revocation checking that was caused because the revocation
    plugin used potentially untrusted OCSP URIs and CRL
    distribution points in certificates.
  * The `pki --scep/--scepca` commands implement the HTTP-based
    "Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol" (RFC 8894 SCEP)
    replacing the old and long deprecated scepclient that has
    been removed.
  * The `pki --est|estca` commands implement the HTTPS-based
    "Enrollment over Secure Transport" (RFC 7070 EST) protocol.
  * The TLS client implementation now sends an empty certificate
    payload if a certificate request is received but no
    certificate is available.
  * The socket plugins don't set the SO_REUSEADDR option anymore
    on the IKE UDP sockets, so an error is triggered if e.g. two
    daemons (e.g. charon and charon-systemd) are running
    concurrently using the same ports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 30 06:48:29 UTC 2022 - Peter Conrad <conrad@quisquis.de>

- Update to release 5.9.7
  * The IKEv2 key derivation is now delayed until the keys are
    actually needed to process or send the next message.
  * Inbound IKEv2 messages, in particular requests, are now
    processed differently.
  * The retransmission logic in the dhcp plugin has been fixed.
  * The connmark plugin now considers configured masks in
    installed firewall rules.
  * Child config selection has been fixed as responder in cases
    where multiple children use transport mode traffic selectors.
  * The outbound SA/policy is now also removed after IKEv1
    CHILD_SA rekeyings.
  * The openssl plugin supports AES and Camellia in CTR mode.
  * The AES-XCBC/CMAC PRFs are demoted in the default proposal
    (after HMAC-based PRFs) since they were never widely adopted.
  * The kdf plugin is now automatically enabled if any of the
    aesni, cmac or xcbc plugins are enabled, or if none of the
    plugins that directly provide HMAC-based KDFs are enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 30 08:21:29 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.6
  * Support for labeled IPsec with IKEv2
    (draft-ietf-ipsecme-labeled-ipsec) has been added. Two modes
    are currently supported.
  * The secrets used for generating COOKIE payloads are now
    switched based on a time limit (2 minutes) and not the
    previous usage limit (10'000 generated cookies).
  * Actively initiating duplicate CHILD_SAs within the same
    IKE_SA is now largely prevented.
  * If the source address is unknown when initiating an IKEv2 SA,
    a NAT situation is now forced for IPv4 (for IPv6, NAT-T is
    disabled) to avoid causing asymmetric enabling of
    UDP-encapsulation.
  * The main two steps of the IKEv2 key derivation (PRF/prf+)
    have been modularized. In particular, prf+ is now provided by
    a plugin.
- Drop prf-plus-modularization.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 12:57:46 UTC 2022 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- prf-plus-modularization.patch: updated from upstream branch
  after certifier feedback, SKEYSEED generated via HKDF-Extract.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 14:49:26 UTC 2022 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Added prf-plus-modularization.patch that outsources the IKE
  key derivation to openssl. (will be merged to 5.9.6)
- package the kdf config, template and plugin

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 26 12:25:35 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.5
  * Fixed a vulnerability in the EAP client implementation
    (CVE-2021-45079 bsc#1194471).
  * libtpmtss may now establish a secure session via RSA OAEP
    public key encryption or an ephemeral ECDH key exchange,
    respectively.
  * When rekeying CHILD_SAs, the old outbound SA is now
    uninstalled earlier on the initiator/winner.
  * The openssl plugin now only announces the ECDH groups
    actually supported by OpenSSL (determined via
    EC_get_builtin_curves()).
  * Added support for AES-CFB.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 08:25:29 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Added patch(es):
  * harden_strongswan.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 22 16:19:08 UTC 2021 - BjÃ¸rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.9.4:
  * Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability in the gmp plugin that
    was caused by an integer overflow when processing RSASSA-PSS
    signatures with very large salt lengths. This vulnerability has
    been registered as CVE-2021-41990. Please refer to our blog for
    details. (bsc#1191367)
  * Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability in the in-memory
    certificate cache if certificates are replaced and a very large
    random value caused an integer overflow. This vulnerability has
    been registered as CVE-2021-41991. Please refer to our blog for
    details. (bsc#1191435)
  * Fixed a related flaw that caused the daemon to accept and cache
    an infinite number of versions of a valid certificate by
    modifying the parameters in the signatureAlgorithm field of the
    outer X.509 Certificate structure.
  * AUTH_LIFETIME notifies are now only sent by a responder if it
    can't reauthenticate the IKE_SA itself due to asymmetric
    authentication (i.e. EAP) or the use of virtual IPs.
  * Several corner cases with reauthentication have been fixed
    (48fbe1d, 36161fe, 0d373e2).
  * Serial number generation in several pki sub-commands has been
    fixed so they don't start with an unintended zero byte.
  * Loading SSH public keys via vici has been improved.
  * Shared secrets, PEM files, vici messages, PF_KEY messages,
    swanctl configs and other data is properly wiped from memory.
  * Use a longer dummy key to initialize HMAC instances in the
    openssl plugin in case it's used in FIPS-mode.
  * The --enable-tpm option now implies --enable-tss-tss2 as the
    plugin doesn't do anything without a TSS 2.0.
  * libtpmtss is initialized in all programs and libraries that use
    it.
  * Migrated testing scripts to Python 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 27 19:01:38 UTC 2021 - BjÃ¸rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.9.3:
  * Added AES-ECB, SHA-3 and SHAKE-256 support to the wolfssl
    plugin.
  * Added AES-CCM support to the openssl plugin (#353 bsc#1185363).
  * The x509 and the openssl plugins now consider the
    authorityKeyIdentifier, if available, before verifying
    signatures, which avoids unnecessary signature verifications
    after a CA key rollover if both CA certificates are loaded.
    The openssl plugin now does the same also for CRLs (the x509
    plugin already did).
  * The pkcs11 plugin better handles optional attributes like
    CKA_TRUSTED, which previously depended on a version check.
  * The NetworkManager backend (charon-nm) now supports using SANs
    as client identities, not only full DNs (#437).
  * charon-tkm now handles IKE encryption.
  * Send a MOBIKE update again if a a change in the NAT mappings is
    detected but the endpoints stay the same (e143a7d).
  * A deadlock in the HA plugin introduced with 5.9.2 has been
    fixed (#456).
  * DSCP values are now also set for NAT keepalives.
  * The ike_derived_keys() hook now receives more keys but in a
    different order (4e29d6f).
  * Converted most of the test case scenarios to the vici
    interface.
- Replace libsoup-devel with pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4) BuildRequires,
  as this is what really checks for. Needed as libsoup-3.0 is
  released.
- 5.9.1
  - README: added a missing " to pki example command (bsc#1167880)
  - fixed a libgcrypt call in FIPS mode (bsc#1180801)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 08:38:01 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 5.9.0
  * Prefer AEAD algorithms for ESP; this puts AES-GCM in a default
    AEAD proposal in front of the previous default proposal.
  * If a connection fails after getting redirected, we now
    restart connecting to the original host, not the one
    redirected to.
  * For peers that don't send the EAP_ONLY_AUTHENTICATION notify
    but still expect to use EAP-only authentication, the
    charon.force_eap_only_authentication option can be enabled to
    force this type of authentication even on non-compliant
    peers.
  * IPv6 virtual IPs are now always enumerated, ignoring the
    charon.prefer_temporary_addrs setting, which should fix route
    installation if the latter is enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  1 16:31:02 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Enable bypass-lan strongswan plugin

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  1 09:39:42 UTC 2020 - BjÃ¸rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.8.4:
  * In IKEv1 Quick Mode make sure that a proposal exists before
    determining lifetimes (fixes a crash due to a null-pointer
    dereference in 5.8.3).
  * OpenSSL currently doesn't support squeezing bytes out of a
    SHAKE128/256 XOF (support was added with 5.8.3) multiple times.
    Unfortunately, EVP_DigestFinalXOF() completely resets the
    context and later calls not simply fail, they cause a
    null-pointer dereference in libcrypto. c5c1898d73 fixes the
    crash at the cost of repeating initializing the whole state and
    allocating too much data for subsequent calls (hopefully, once
    the OpenSSL issue 7894 is resolved we can implement this more
    efficiently).
  * On 32-bit platforms, reading arbitrary 32-bit integers from
    config files (e.g. for charon.spi_min/max) has been fixed.
  * charon-nm now allows using fixed source ports.
- Changes from version 5.8.3:
  * Updates for the NM plugin (and backend, which has to be updated
    to be compatible):
    + EAP-TLS authentication (#2097)
    + Certificate source (file, agent, smartcard) is selectable
      independently
    + Add support to configure local and remote identities (#2581)
    + Support configuring a custom server port (#625)
    + Show hint regarding password storage policy
    + Replaced the term "gateway" with "server"
    + Fixes build issues due to use of deprecated GLib
      macros/functions
    + Updated Glade file to GTK 3.2
  * The NM backend now supports reauthentication and redirection.
  * Previously used reqids are now reallocated, which works around
    an issue on FreeBSD where the kernel doesn't allow the daemon
    to use reqids > 16383 (#2315).
  * On Linux, throw type routes are installed in table 220 for
    passthrough policies. The kernel will then fall back on routes
    in routing tables with lower priorities for matching traffic.
    This way, they require less information (e.g. no interface or
    source IP) and can be installed earlier and are not affected by
    updates.
  * For IKEv1, the lifetimes of the actually selected transform are
    returned to the initiator, which is an issue if the peer uses
    different lifetimes for different transforms (#3329). We now
    also return the correct transform and proposal IDs (proposal ID
    was always 0, transform ID 1). IKE_SAs are now not
    re-established anymore (e.g. after several retransmits) if a
    deletion has been queued (#3335).
  * Added support for Ed448 keys and certificates via openssl
    plugin and pki tool.
  * Added support for SHA-3 and SHAKE128/256 in the openssl plugin.
  * The use of algorithm IDs from the private use range can now be
    enabled globally, to use them even if no strongSwan vendor ID
    was exchanged (05e373aeb0).
  * Fixed a compiler issue that may have caused invalid keyUsage
    extensions in certificates (#3249).
  * A lot of spelling fixes.
  * Fixed several reported issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  6 22:14:57 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.6.3 (CVE-2018-10811, boo#1093536,
  CVE-2018-5388, boo#1094462):
  * Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if the
    openssl plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is negotiated
    as PRF. This vulnerability has been registered as
    CVE-2018-10811, boo#1093536.
  * Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did not check
    the received length before reading a message from the socket.
    Unless a group is configured, root privileges are required to
    access that socket, so in the default configuration this
    shouldn't be an issue. This vulnerability has been registered
    as CVE-2018-5388, boo#1094462.
  * CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid problems
    in scenarios where expired certificates are removed from new
    CRLs and the clock on the host doing the revocation check is
    trailing behind that of the host issuing CRLs. Not doing this
    could result in accepting a revoked and expired certificate, if
    it's still valid according to the trailing clock but not
    contained anymore in not yet valid CRLs.
  * The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer of the
    checked certificate (#2608).
  * CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a skipped
    check because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are now stored also
    for intermediate CA certificates and not only for end-entity
    certificates, so a strict CRL policy can be enforced in such
    cases.
  * In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2, certificates used
    for IKE must now either not contain a keyUsage extension (like
    the ones generated by pki), or have at least one of the
    digitalSignature or nonRepudiation bits set.
  * New options for vici/swanctl allow forcing the local
    termination of an IKE_SA. This might be useful in situations
    where it's known the other end is not reachable anymore, or
    that it already removed the IKE_SA, so retransmitting a DELETE
    and waiting for a response would be pointless.
  * Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response (i.e.
    shorter than all retransmits would be) before destroying the
    IKE_SA is also possible by additionally specifying a timeout in
    the forced termination request.
  * When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now checks if
    it tracks other routes for the same destination and replaces
    the installed route instead of just removing it. Same during
    installation, where existing routes previously weren't
    replaced. This should allow using traps with virtual IPs on
    Linux (#2162).
  * The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier DHCP
    option if the identity_lease setting is enabled (7b660944b6).
    It can also send identities of up to 255 bytes length, instead
    of the previous 64 bytes (30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server
    address is configured, DHCP requests are now sent from port 67
    instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port unreachables (becf027cd9).
  * The handling of faulty INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g. one
    containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during
    CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges has been improved (#2536).
  * Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs (there is
    no MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).
  * ChaCha20/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key length
    (#2614). For compatibility with older releases the
    chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in proposals to
    also propose the algorithm with a key length (c58434aeff).
  * Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now more
    flexible and allows a new setting (auto), which automatically
    uses it if the kernel and device both support it. If hw_offload
    is set to yes and offloading is not supported, the CHILD_SA
    installation now fails.
  * The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via internal
    interface (one with an IP in the local traffic selector). On
    FreeBSD, enabling this selects the correct source IP when
    sending packets from the gateway itself (e811659323).
  * SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as generated by
    OpenSSL 1.1 (#2574).
  * The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs from
    directories.
  * The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the remote
    port is not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the response to a
    different port, as might happen on Azure), as long as the local
    port is 500 (85bfab621d).
  * Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager in
    charon-nm (ee8c25516a).
  * Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol if
    either protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).
  * Only the inbound SA/policy will be updated as reaction to IP
    address changes for rekeyed CHILD_SAs that are kept around.
  * The parser for strongswan.conf/swanctl.conf now accepts =
    characters in values without having to put the value in quotes
    (e.g. for Base64 encoded shared secrets).
- Rename strongswan-5.6.2-rpmlintrc to strongswan-rpmlintrc,
  changing the version string on every version update makes no
  sense.

- Update to version 5.6.2:
  * Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS
    signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation.
    One of the configurable parameters in algorithm identifier
    structures for RSASSA-PSS signatures is the mask generation
    function (MGF). Only MGF1 is currently specified for this
    purpose. However, this in turn takes itself a parameter that
    specifies the underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did
    not correctly handle the case of this parameter being absent,
    causing an undefined data read. This vulnerability has been
    registered as CVE-2018-6459.
  * When rekeying IKEv2 IKE_SAs the previously negotiated DH group
    will be reused, instead of using the first configured group,
    which avoids an additional exchange if the peer previously
    selected a different DH group via INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD notify.
    The same is also done when rekeying CHILD_SAs except for the
    first rekeying of the CHILD_SA that was created with the
    IKE_SA, where no DH group was negotiated yet. Also, the
    selected DH group is moved to the front in all sent proposals
    that contain it and all proposals that don't are moved to the
    back in order to convey the preference for this group to the
    peer.
  * Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In
    particular, the response to an address update (with NAT-D
    payloads) is not ignored anymore if only an address list update
    or DPD is queued as that could prevent updating the UDP
    encapsulation in the kernel.
  * On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by changes to
    the routing rules, which can be useful if routing rules
    (instead of e.g. route metrics) are used to switch from one to
    another interface (i.e. from one to another routing table).
    Since routing rules are currently not evaluated when doing
    route lookups this is only useful if the kernel-based route
    lookup is used (4664992f7d).
  * The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic leaks
    when replacing addresses in installed policies are now replaced
    by temporary drop policies, which also prevent acquires because
    we currently delete and reinstall IPsec SAs to update their
    addresses (35ef1b032d).
  * Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage of a TPM
    2.0 referenced via the NV index.
  * Adding the --keyid parameter to pki --print allows to print
    private keys or certificates stored in a smartcard or a TPM
    2.0.
  * Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH groups
    in the ESP proposal during IKE_AUTH and also if a DH group is
    configured in the local ESP proposal and
    charon.prefer_configured_proposals is disabled (d058fd3c32).
  * The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved for
    certain scenarios (see #2497 for details).
  * MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to avoid
    compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs that have a
    block size < 64 bytes (e.g. AES-XCBC-PRF-128, see 73cbce6013).
  * The tpm_extendpcr command line tool extends a digest into a TPM
    PCR.
  * Ported the NetworkManager backend from the deprecated
    libnm-glib to libnm.
  * The save-keys debugging/development plugin saves IKE and/or ESP
    keys to files compatible with Wireshark.
- Following upstreams port, replace NetworkManager-devel with
  pkgconfig(libnm) BuildRequires.
- Refresh patches with quilt.
- Disable strongswan_fipsfilter.patch, needs rebase or dropping,
  the file it patches no longer exists in tarball.

Tue Sep  5 17:10:11 CEST 2017 - ndas@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.6.0 providing the following changes:
    *Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the gmp plugin that was caused by insufficient input validation
    when verifying RSA signatures, which requires decryption with the operation m^e mod n,
    where m is the signature, and e and n are the exponent and modulus of the public key.
    The value m is an integer between 0 and n-1, however, the gmp plugin did not verify this.
    So if m equals n the calculation results in 0, in which case mpz_export() returns NULL.
    This result wasn't handled properly causing a null-pointer dereference.
    This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2017-11185. (bsc#1051222)

    *New SWIMA IMC/IMV pair implements the draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc Internet
    Draft and has been demonstrated at the IETF 99 Prague Hackathon.

    *The IMV database template has been adapted to achieve full compliance with the
    ISO 19770-2:2015 SWID tag standard.

    *The pt-tls-client can attach and use TPM 2.0 protected private keys via the --keyid parameter.

    *By default the /etc/swanctl/conf.d directory is created and *.conf files in it are included in the default
    swanctl.conf file.

    *The curl plugin now follows HTTP redirects (configurable via strongswan.conf).

    *The CHILD_SA rekeying was fixed in charon-tkm and the behavior is refined a bit more since 5.5.3

    *libtpmtss supports Intel's TSS2 Architecture Broker and Resource Manager interface (tcti-tabrmd).

Mon Jul 31 18:30:28 CEST 2017 - ndas@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.3.5(bsc#1050691) providing the following changes:
    *Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the gmp plugin that was caused by insufficient input
    validation when verifying RSA signatures. More specifically, mpz_powm_sec() has two
    requirements regarding the passed exponent and modulus that the plugin did not
    enforce, if these are not met the calculation will result in a floating point exception
    that crashes the whole process.
    This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2017-9022.
    Please refer to our blog for details.

    *Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the x509 plugin that was caused because the ASN.1 parser
    didn't handle ASN.1 CHOICE types properly, which could result in an infinite loop when
    parsing X.509 extensions that use such types.
    This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2017-9023.
    Please refer to our blog for details.

    *The behavior during IKEv2 CHILD_SA rekeying has been changed in order to avoid
    traffic loss. When responding to a CREATE_CHILD_SA request to rekey a CHILD_SA
    the responder already has everything available to install and use the new CHILD_SA.
    However, this could lead to lost traffic as the initiator won't be able to process
    inbound packets until it processed the CREATE_CHILD_SA response and updated the
    inbound SA. To avoid this the responder now only installs the new inbound SA and
    delays installing the outbound SA until it receives the DELETE for the replaced CHILD_SA.

    *The messages transporting these DELETEs could reach the peer before packets sent
    with the deleted outbound SAs reach it. To reduce the chance of traffic loss due
    to this the inbound SA of the replaced CHILD_SA is not removed for a configurable
    amount of seconds (charon.delete_rekeyed_delay) after the DELETE has been processed.

    *The code base has been ported to Apple's ARM64 iOS platform, which required several
    changes regarding the use of variadic functions. This was necessary because the calling
    conventions for variadic and regular functions are different there.
    This means that assigning a non-variadic function to a variadic function pointer, as we
    did with our enumerator_t::enumerate() implementations and several callbacks, will
    result in crashes as the called function accesses the arguments differently than the
    caller provided them. To avoid this issue the enumerator_t interface has been changed
    and the signature of the callback functions for enumerator_create_filter() and two
    methods on linked_list_t have been changed. Refer to the developer notes below
    for details.

    *Adds support for fuzzing the certificate parser provided by the default plugins
    (x509, pem, gmp etc.) on Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure (or generally with
    libFuzzer). Several issues found while fuzzing these plugins were fixed.

    *Two new options have been added to charon's retransmission settings:
    retransmit_limit and retransmit_jitter. The former adds an upper limit to the
    calculated retransmission timeout, the latter randomly reduces it.
    Refer to Retransmission for details.

    *A bug in swanctl's --load-creds command was fixed that caused unencrypted
    private keys to get unloaded if the command was called multiple times.
    The load-key VICI command now returns the key ID of the loaded key on success.

    *The credential manager now enumerates local credential sets before global ones.
    This means certificates supplied by the peer will now be preferred over certificates
    with the same identity that may be locally stored (e.g. in the certificate cache).

    *Adds support for hardware offload of IPsec SAs as introduced by Linux 4.11 for
    specific hardware that supports this.

    *The pki tool loads the curve25519 plugin by default.

- Updated to strongSwan 5.3.5 providing the following changes:
  Changes in version 5.3.5:
  * Properly handle potential EINTR errors in sigwaitinfo(2) calls
    that replaced sigwait(3) calls with 5.3.4.
  * RADIUS retransmission timeouts are now configurable, courtesy
    of Thom Troy.
  Changes in version 5.3.4:
  * Fixed an authentication bypass vulnerability in the
    eap-mschapv2 plugin that was caused by insufficient
    verification of the internal state when handling MSCHAPv2
    Success messages received by the client. This vulnerability
    has been registered as CVE-2015-8023.
  * The sha3 plugin implements the SHA3 Keccak-F1600 hash
    algorithm family. Within the strongSwan framework SHA3 is
    currently used for BLISS signatures only because the OIDs for
    other signature algorithms haven't been defined yet. Also the
    use of SHA3 for IKEv2 has not been standardized yet.
  Changes in version 5.3.3:
  * Added support for the ChaCha20/Poly1305 AEAD cipher specified
    in RFC 7539 and RFC 7634 using the chacha20poly1305 ike/esp
    proposal keyword. The new chapoly plugin implements the
    cipher, if possible SSE-accelerated on x86/x64 architectures.
    It is usable both in IKEv2 and the strongSwan libipsec ESP
    backend. On Linux 4.2 or newer the kernel-netlink plugin can
    configure the cipher for ESP SAs.
  * The vici interface now supports the configuration of auxiliary
    certification authority information as CRL and OCSP URIs.
  * In the bliss plugin the c_indices derivation using a SHA-512
    based random oracle has been fixed, generalized and
    standardized by employing the MGF1 mask generation function
    with SHA-512. As a consequence BLISS signatures unsing the
    improved oracle are not compatible with the earlier
    implementation.
  * Support for auto=route with right=%any for transport mode
    connections has been added (the ikev2/trap-any scenario
    provides examples).
  * The starter daemon does not flush IPsec policies and SAs
    anymore when it is stopped. Already existing duplicate
    policies are now overwritten by the IKE daemon when it
    installs its policies.
  * Init limits (like charon.init_limit_half_open) can now
    optionally be enforced when initiating SAs via VICI. For this,
    IKE_SAs initiated by the daemon are now also counted as half
    open SAs, which, as a side-effect, fixes the status output
    while connecting (e.g. in ipsec status).
  * Symmetric configuration of EAP methods in left|rightauth is
    now possible when mutual EAP-only authentication is used
    (previously, the client had to configure rightauth=eap or
    rightauth=any, which prevented it from using this same config
    as responder).
  * The initiator flag in the IKEv2 header is compared again
    (wasn't the case since 5.0.0) and packets that have the flag
    set incorrectly are again ignored.
  * Implemented a demo Hardcopy Device IMC/IMV pair based on the
    "Hardcopy Device Health Assessment Trusted Network Connect
    Binding" (HCD-TNC) document drafted by the IEEE Printer
    Working Group (PWG).
  * Fixed IF-M segmentation which failed in the presence of
    multiple small attributes in front of a huge attribute to be
    segmented.
  Changes in version 5.3.2:
  * Fixed a vulnerability that allowed rogue servers with a valid
    certificate accepted by the client to trick it into disclosing
    its username and even password (if the client accepts
    EAP-GTC).  This was caused because constraints against the
    responder's authentication were enforced too late. This
    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2015-4171.
  Changes in version 5.3.1:
  * Fixed a denial-of-service and potential remote code execution
    vulnerability triggered by IKEv1/IKEv2 messages that contain
    payloads for the respective other IKE version. Such payload
    are treated specially since 5.2.2 but because they were still
    identified by their original payload type they were used as
    such in some places causing invalid function pointer
    dereferences. The vulnerability has been registered as
    CVE-2015-3991.
  * The new aesni plugin provides CBC, CTR, XCBC, CMAC, CCM and
    GCM crypto primitives for AES-128/192/256. The plugin requires
    AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ instructions and works on both x86 and
    x64 architectures. It provides superior crypto performance in
    userland without any external libraries.
  Changes in version 5.3.0:
  * Added support for IKEv2 make-before-break reauthentication. By
    using a global CHILD_SA reqid allocation mechanism, charon
    supports overlapping CHILD_SAs. This allows the use of
    make-before-break instead of the previously supported
    break-before-make reauthentication, avoiding connectivity gaps
    during that procedure. As the new mechanism may fail with peers
    not supporting it (such as any previous strongSwan release) it
    must be explicitly enabled using the charon.make_before_break
    strongswan.conf option.
  * Support for "Signature Authentication in IKEv2" (RFC 7427) has
    been added. This allows the use of stronger hash algorithms
    for public key authentication. By default, signature schemes
    are chosen based on the strength of the signature key, but
    specific hash algorithms may be configured in leftauth.
  * Key types and hash algorithms specified in rightauth are now
    also checked against IKEv2 signature schemes. If such
    constraints are used for certificate chain validation in
    existing configurations, in particular with peers that don't
    support RFC 7427, it may be necessary to disable this feature
    with the charon.signature_authentication_constraints setting,
    because the signature scheme used in classic IKEv2 public key
    authentication may not be strong enough.
  * The new connmark plugin allows a host to bind conntrack flows
    to a specific CHILD_SA by applying and restoring the SA mark
    to conntrack entries. This allows a peer to handle multiple
    transport mode connections coming over the same NAT device for
    client-initiated flows. A common use case is to protect
    L2TP/IPsec, as supported by some systems.
  * The forecast plugin can forward broadcast and multicast
    messages between connected clients and a LAN. For CHILD_SA
    using unique marks, it sets up the required Netfilter rules
    and uses a multicast/broadcast listener that forwards such
    messages to all connected clients. This plugin is designed for
    Windows 7 IKEv2 clients, which announces its services over the
    tunnel if the negotiated IPsec policy allows it.
  * For the vici plugin a Python Egg has been added to allow
    Python applications to control or monitor the IKE daemon using
    the VICI interface, similar to the existing ruby gem. The
    Python library has been contributed by BjÃ¶rn Schuberg.
  * EAP server methods now can fulfill public key constraints,
    such as rightcert or rightca. Additionally, public key and
    signature constraints can be specified for EAP methods in the
    rightauth keyword. Currently the EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS methods
    provide verification details to constraints checking.
  * Upgrade of the BLISS post-quantum signature algorithm to the
    improved BLISS-B variant. Can be used in conjunction with the
    SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 hash algorithms with SHA512 being
    the default.
  * The IF-IMV 1.4 interface now makes the IP address of the TNC
    access requestor as seen by the TNC server available to all
    IMVs. This information can be forwarded to policy enforcement
    points (e.g. firewalls or routers).
  * The new mutual tnccs-20 plugin parameter activates mutual TNC
    measurements in PB-TNC half-duplex mode between two endpoints
    over either a PT-EAP or PT-TLS transport medium.

Mon Jan  5 14:38:46 UTC 2015 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.2.2 providing the following changes:
  Changes in version 5.2.2:
  * Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by an IKEv2 Key Exchange
    payload that contains the Diffie-Hellman group 1025. This identifier was
    used internally for DH groups with custom generator and prime. Because
    these arguments are missing when creating DH objects based on the KE
    payload an invalid pointer dereference occurred.  This allowed an attacker
    to crash the IKE daemon with a single IKE_SA_INIT message containing such
    a KE payload. The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2014-9221.
  * The left/rightid options in ipsec.conf, or any other identity in
    strongSwan, now accept prefixes to enforce an explicit type, such as
    email: or fqdn:. Note that no conversion is done for the remaining string,
    refer to ipsec.conf(5) for details.
  * The post-quantum Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) can be used as
    an IKEv2 public key authentication method. The pki tool offers full
    support for the generation of BLISS key pairs and certificates.
  * Fixed mapping of integrity algorithms negotiated for AH via IKEv1.
    This could cause interoperability issues when connecting to older versions
    of charon.
  Changes in version 5.2.1:
  * The new charon-systemd IKE daemon implements an IKE daemon tailored for
    use with systemd. It avoids the dependency on ipsec starter and uses
    swanctl as configuration backend, building a simple and lightweight
    solution. It supports native systemd journal logging.
  * Support for IKEv2 fragmentation as per RFC 7383 has been added. Like IKEv1
    fragmentation it can be enabled by setting fragmentation=yes in ipsec.conf.
  * Support of the TCG TNC IF-M Attribute Segmentation specification proposal.
    All attributes can be segmented. Additionally TCG/SWID Tag, TCG/SWID Tag ID
    and IETF/Installed Packages attributes can be processed incrementally on a
    per segment basis.
  * The new ext-auth plugin calls an external script to implement custom IKE_SA
    authorization logic, courtesy of Vyronas Tsingaras.
  * For the vici plugin a ruby gem has been added to allow ruby applications to
    control or monitor the IKE daemon. The vici documentation has been updated
    to include a description of the available operations and some simple
    examples using both the libvici C interface and the ruby gem.
  Changes in version 5.2.0:
  * strongSwan has been ported to the Windows platform. Using a MinGW toolchain,
    many parts of the strongSwan codebase run natively on Windows 7 / 2008 R2
    and newer releases. charon-svc implements a Windows IKE service based on
    libcharon, the kernel-iph and kernel-wfp plugins act as networking and IPsec
    backend on the Windows platform. socket-win provides a native IKE socket
    implementation, while winhttp fetches CRL and OCSP information using the
    WinHTTP API.
  * The new vici plugin provides a Versatile IKE Configuration Interface for
    charon. Using the stable IPC interface, external applications can configure,
    control and monitor the IKE daemon. Instead of scripting the ipsec tool
    and generating ipsec.conf, third party applications can use the new interface
    for more control and better reliability.
  * Built upon the libvici client library, swanctl implements the first user of
    the VICI interface. Together with a swanctl.conf configuration file,
    connections can be defined, loaded and managed. swanctl provides a portable,
    complete IKE configuration and control interface for the command line.
    The first six swanctl example scenarios have been added.
  * The SWID IMV implements a JSON-based REST API which allows the exchange
    of SWID tags and Software IDs with the strongTNC policy manager.
  * The SWID IMC can extract all installed packages from the dpkg (Debian,
    Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc.), rpm (Fedora, RedHat, OpenSUSE, etc.), or
    pacman (Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc.) package managers, respectively, using
    the swidGenerator (https://github.com/strongswan/swidGenerator) which
    generates SWID tags according to the new ISO/IEC 19770-2:2014 standard.
  * All IMVs now share the access requestor ID, device ID and product info
    of an access requestor via a common imv_session object.
  * The Attestation IMC/IMV pair supports the IMA-NG measurement format
    introduced with the Linux 3.13 kernel.
  * The aikgen tool generates an Attestation Identity Key bound to a TPM.
  * Implemented the PT-EAP transport protocol (RFC 7171) for Trusted Network
    Connect.
  * The ipsec.conf replay_window option defines connection specific IPsec
    replay windows. Original patch courtesy of Zheng Zhong and Christophe
    Gouault from 6Wind.

Mon Apr 14 23:36:07 UTC 2014 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.1.3 providing the following changes:
  - Fixed an authentication bypass vulnerability triggered by rekeying
    an unestablished IKEv2 SA while it gets actively initiated. This
    allowed an attacker to trick a peer's IKE_SA state to established,
    without the need to provide any valid authentication credentials.
    (CVE-2014-2338, bnc#870572).
  - The acert plugin evaluates X.509 Attribute Certificates. Group
    membership information encoded as strings can be used to fulfill
    authorization checks defined with the rightgroups option.
    Attribute Certificates can be loaded locally or get exchanged in
    IKEv2 certificate payloads.
  - The pki command gained support to generate X.509 Attribute
    Certificates using the --acert subcommand, while the --print
    command supports the ac type. The openac utility has been removed
    in favor of the new pki functionality.
  - The libtls TLS 1.2 implementation as used by EAP-(T)TLS and other
    protocols has been extended by AEAD mode support, currently limited
    to AES-GCM.
  - Fixed an issue where CRL/OCSP trustchain validation broke enforcing
    CA constraints
  - Limited OCSP signing to specific certificates to improve performance
  - authKeyIdentifier is not added to self-signed certificates anymore
  - Fixed the comparison of IKE configs if only the cipher suites were
    different

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 05:53:21 UTC 2014 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.1.2 providing the following changes:
  - A new default configuration file layout is introduced. The new
    default strongswan.conf file mainly includes config snippets from
    the strongswan.d and strongswan.d/charon directories (the latter
    containing snippets for all plugins). The snippets, with commented
    defaults, are automatically generated and installed, if they don't
    exist yet. Also installed in $prefix/share/strongswan/templates so
    existing files can be compared to the current defaults.
  - As an alternative to the non-extensible charon.load setting, the
    plugins to load in charon (and optionally other applications) can
    now be determined via the charon.plugins.<name>.load setting for
    each plugin (enabled in the new default strongswan.conf file via the
    charon.load_modular option). The load setting optionally takes a
    numeric priority value that allows reordering the plugins (otherwise
    the default plugin order is preserved).
  - All strongswan.conf settings that were formerly defined in library
    specific "global" sections are now application specific (e.g.
    settings for plugins in libstrongswan.plugins can now be set only
    for charon in charon.plugins). The old options are still supported,
    which now allows to define defaults for all applications in the
    libstrongswan section.
  - The ntru libstrongswan plugin supports NTRUEncrypt as a post-quantum
    computer IKE key exchange mechanism. The implementation is based on
    the ntru-crypto library from the NTRUOpenSourceProject.
    The supported security strengths are ntru112, ntru128, ntru192, and
    ntru256. Since the private DH group IDs 1030..1033 have been
    assigned, the strongSwan Vendor ID must be sent in order to use NTRU
    (charon.send_vendor_id = yes).
  - Defined a TPMRA remote attestation workitem and added support for it
    to the Attestation IMV.
  - Compatibility issues between IPComp (compress=yes) and
    leftfirewall=yes as well as multiple subnets in left|rightsubnet
    have been fixed.
  - When enabling its "session" strongswan.conf option, the xauth-pam
    plugin opens and closes a PAM session for each established IKE_SA.
    Patch courtesy of Andrea Bonomi.
  - The strongSwan unit testing framework has been rewritten without the
    "check" dependency for improved flexibility and portability. It now
    properly supports multi-threaded and memory leak testing and brings
    a bunch of new test cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  1 12:28:39 UTC 2013 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.1.1 minor release addressing two security
  fixes (bnc#847506,CVE-2013-6075, bnc#847509,CVE-2013-6076):
  - Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability and potential authorization
    bypass triggered by a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload. The cause
    is an insufficient length check when comparing such identities. The
    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2013-6075.
  - Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by a crafted IKEv1
    fragmentation payload. The cause is a NULL pointer dereference. The
    vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2013-6076.
  - The lean stand-alone pt-tls-client can set up a RFC 6876 PT-TLS
    session with a strongSwan policy enforcement point which uses the
    tnc-pdp charon plugin.
  - The new TCG TNC SWID IMC/IMV pair supports targeted SWID requests
    for either full SWID Tag or concise SWID Tag ID inventories.
  - The XAuth backend in eap-radius now supports multiple XAuth
    exchanges for different credential types and display messages.
    All user input gets concatenated and verified with a single
    User-Password RADIUS attribute on the AAA. With an AAA supporting
    it, one for example can implement Password+Token authentication with
    proper dialogs on iOS and OS X clients.  - charon supports IKEv1 Mode
    Config exchange in push mode. The ipsec.conf modeconfig=push option
    enables it for both client and server, the same way as pluto used it.
  - Using the "ah" ipsec.conf keyword on both IKEv1 and IKEv2
    connections, charon can negotiate and install Security Associations
    integrity-protected by the Authentication Header protocol. Supported
    are plain AH(+IPComp) SAs only, but not the deprecated RFC2401 style
    ESP+AH bundles.
  - The generation of initialization vectors for IKE and ESP (when using
    libipsec) is now modularized and IVs for e.g. AES-GCM are now correctly
    allocated sequentially, while other algorithms like AES-CBC still
    use random IVs.
  - The left and right options in ipsec.conf can take multiple address
    ranges and subnets. This allows connection matching against a larger
    set of addresses, for example to use a different connection for clients
    connecting from a internal network.
  - For all those who have a queasy feeling about the NIST elliptic curve
    set, the Brainpool curves introduced for use with IKE by RFC 6932 might
    be a more trustworthy alternative.
  - The kernel-libipsec userland IPsec backend now supports usage
    statistics, volume based rekeying and accepts ESPv3 style TFC padded
    packets.
  - With two new strongswan.conf options fwmarks can be used to implement
    host-to-host tunnels with kernel-libipsec.
  - load-tester supports transport mode connections and more complex
    traffic selectors, including such using unique ports for each tunnel.
  - The new dnscert plugin provides support for authentication via CERT
    RRs that are protected via DNSSEC.  The plugin was created by Ruslan
    N. Marchenko.
  - The eap-radius plugin supports forwarding of several Cisco Unity
    specific RADIUS attributes in corresponding configuration payloads.
  - Database transactions are now abstracted and implemented by the two
    backends. If you use MySQL make sure all tables use the InnoDB engine.
  - libstrongswan now can provide an experimental custom implementation
    of the printf family functions based on klibc if neither Vstr nor
    glibc style printf hooks are available. This can avoid the Vstr
    dependency on some systems at the cost of slower and less complete
    printf functions.
- Adjusted file lists: this version installs the pki utility and manuals
  in common /usr directories and additional ipsec/pt-tls-client helper.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  5 13:48:11 UTC 2013 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.1.0 release (bnc#833278, CVE-2013-5018):
  - Fixed a denial-of-service vulnerability triggered by specific XAuth
    usernames and EAP identities (since 5.0.3), and PEM files (since
    4.1.11). The crash was caused by insufficient error handling in the
    is_asn1() function. The vulnerability has been registered as
    CVE-2013-5018.
  - The new charon-cmd command line IKE client can establish road
    warrior connections using IKEv1 or IKEv2 with different
    authentication profiles. It does not depend on any configuration
    files and can be configured using a few simple command line options.
  - The kernel-pfroute networking backend has been greatly improved.
    It now can install virtual IPs on TUN devices on OS X and FreeBSD,
    allowing these systems to act as a client in common road warrior
    scenarios.
  - The new kernel-libipsec plugin uses TUN devices and libipsec to
    provide IPsec processing in userland on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
  - The eap-radius plugin can now serve as an XAuth backend called
    xauth-radius, directly verifying XAuth credentials using RADIUS
    User-Name/User-Password attributes. This is more efficient than the
    existing xauth-eap+eap-radius combination, and allows RADIUS servers
    without EAP support to act as AAA backend for IKEv1.
  - The new osx-attr plugin installs configuration attributes (currently
    DNS servers) via SystemConfiguration on Mac OS X. The keychain
    plugin provides certificates from the OS X keychain service.
  - The sshkey plugin parses SSH public keys, which, together with the
    --agent option for charon-cmd, allows the use of ssh-agent for
    authentication. To configure SSH keys in ipsec.conf the
    left|rightrsasigkey options are replaced with left|rightsigkey,
    which now take public keys in one of three formats: SSH (RFC 4253,
    ssh: prefix), DNSKEY (RFC 3110, dns: prefix), and PKCS#1 (the
    default, no prefix).
  - Extraction of certificates and private keys from PKCS#12 files is
    now provided by the new pkcs12 plugin or the openssl plugin.
    charon-cmd (--p12) as well as charon (via P12 token in
    ipsec.secrets) can make use of this.
  - IKEv2 can now negotiate transport mode and IPComp in NAT situations.
  - IKEv2 exchange initiators now properly close an established IKE or
    CHILD_SA on error conditions using an additional exchange, keeping
    state in sync between peers.
  - Using a SQL database interface a Trusted Network Connect (TNC)
    Policy Manager can  generate specific measurement workitems for an
    arbitrary number of Integrity Measurement Verifiers (IMVs) based on
    the history of the VPN user and/or device.
  - Several core classes in libstrongswan are now tested with unit
    tests. These can be enabled with --enable-unit-tests and run with
    'make check'.
    Coverage reports can be generated with --enable-coverage and 'make
    coverage' (this disables any optimization, so it should not be
    enabled when building production releases).
  - The leak-detective developer tool has been greatly improved. It
    works much faster/stabler with multiple threads, does not use
    deprecated malloc hooks anymore and has been ported to OS X.
  - chunk_hash() is now based on SipHash-2-4 with a random key. This
    provides better distribution and prevents hash flooding attacks
    when used with hashtables.
  - All default plugins implement the get_features() method to define
    features and their dependencies. The plugin loader has been
    improved, so that plugins in a custom load statement can be ordered
    freely or to express preferences without being affected by
    dependencies between plugin features.
  - A centralized thread can take care for watching multiple file
    descriptors concurrently. This removes the need for a dedicated
    listener threads in various plugins. The number of "reserved"
    threads for such tasks has been reduced to about five, depending on
    the plugin configuration.
  - Plugins that can be controlled by a UNIX socket IPC mechanism gained
    network transparency. Third party applications querying these
    plugins now can use TCP connections from a different host.
  - libipsec now supports AES-GCM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 12:48:44 UTC 2013 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 5.0.4 release (bnc#815236, CVE-2013-2944):
  - Fixed a security vulnerability in the openssl plugin which was
    reported by Kevin Wojtysiak.  The vulnerability has been registered
    as CVE-2013-2944. Before the fix, if the openssl plugin's ECDSA
    signature verification was used, due to a misinterpretation of the
    error code returned by the OpenSSL ECDSA_verify() function, an empty
    or zeroed signature was accepted as a legitimate one. Refer to our
    blog for details.
  - The handling of a couple of other non-security relevant OpenSSL
    return codes was fixed as well.
  - The tnc_ifmap plugin now publishes virtual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    via its TCG TNC IF-MAP 2.1 interface.
  - The charon.initiator_only strongswan.conf option causes charon to
    ignore IKE initiation requests.
  - The openssl plugin can now use the openssl-fips library.
  The version 5.0.3 provides new ipseckey plugin, enabling authentication
  based on trustworthy public keys stored as IPSECKEY resource records in
  the DNS and protected by DNSSEC and new openssl plugin using the AES-NI
  accelerated version of AES-GCM if the hardware supports it.

- Updated to strongSwan 5.0.1 release. Changes digest:
  - Introduced the sending of the standard IETF Assessment Result
    PA-TNC attribute by all strongSwan Integrity Measurement Verifiers.
  - Extended PTS Attestation IMC/IMV pair to provide full evidence of
    the Linux IMA measurement process. All pertinent file information
    of a Linux OS can be collected and stored in an SQL database.
  - The PA-TNC and PB-TNC protocols can now process huge data payloads.
  - The xauth-pam backend can authenticate IKEv1 XAuth and Hybrid
    authenticated clients against any PAM service.
  - The new unity plugin brings support for some parts of the IKEv1
    Cisco Unity Extensions.
  - The kernel-netlink plugin supports the new strongswan.conf option
    charon.install_virtual_ip_on.
  - Job handling in controller_t was fixed, which occasionally caused
    crashes on ipsec up/down.
  - Fixed transmission EAP-MSCHAPv2 user name if it contains a domain
    part.
  Changes digest from strongSwan 5.0.0 version:
  * The charon IKE daemon gained experimental support for the IKEv1
    protocol. Pluto has been removed from the 5.x series.
  * The NetworkManager charon plugin of previous releases is now
    provided by a separate executable (charon-nm) and it should work
    again with NM 0.9.
  * scepclient was updated and it now works fine with Windows Server
    2008 R2.
  For full list of the changes, please read the NEWS file shipped
  in the strongswan-doc package or online:
  http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Changelog50
- Adopted spec file, enabled several plugins, e.g.: ccm, certexpire,
  coupling, ctr, duplicheck, eap-dynamic, eap-peap, eap-tls, eap-tnc,
  eap-ttls, gcm, nonce, radattr, tnc, tnccs, unity, xauth-eap and pam.
- Changed to install strongswan.service with alias to ipsec.service
  instead of the /etc/init.d/ipsec init script on openSUSE > 12.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  7 08:36:57 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.de

- Applied upstream patch adjusting an internal thread id causing
  charon keying daemon start failure (bnc#779038,strongswan#198):
    openssl: Ensure the thread ID is never zero
    This might otherwise cause problems because OpenSSL tries to
    lock mutexes recursively if it assumes the lock is held by a
    different thread e.g. during FIPS initialization.
  See http://wiki.strongswan.org/issues/198 for more informations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 31 16:08:43 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to strongSwan 4.6.4 release:
  - Fixed a security vulnerability in the gmp plugin. If this
    plugin was used for RSA signature verification an empty or
    zeroed signature was handled as a legitimate one
    (bnc#761325, CVE-2012-2388).
  - Fixed several issues with reauthentication and address updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 10 09:15:38 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to strongSwan 4.6.3 release:
  - The tnc-pdp plugin implements a RADIUS server interface allowing
    a strongSwan TNC server to act as a Policy Decision Point.
  - The eap-radius authentication backend enforces Session-Timeout
    attributes using RFC4478 repeated authentication and acts upon
    RADIUS Dynamic Authorization extensions, RFC 5176. Currently
    supported are disconnect requests and CoA messages containing
    a Session-Timeout.
  - The eap-radius plugin can forward arbitrary RADIUS attributes
    from and to clients using custom IKEv2 notify payloads. The new
    radattr plugin reads attributes to include from files and prints
    received attributes to the console.
  - Added support for untruncated MD5 and SHA1 HMACs in ESP as used
    in RFC 4595.
  - The cmac plugin implements the AES-CMAC-96 and AES-CMAC-PRF-128
    algorithms as defined in RFC 4494 and RFC 4615, respectively.
  - The resolve plugin automatically installs nameservers via
    resolvconf(8), if it is installed, instead of modifying
    /etc/resolv.conf directly.
  - The IKEv2 charon daemon supports now raw RSA public keys in RFC
    3110 DNSKEY and PKCS#1 file format.
  - The farp plugin sends ARP responses for any tunneled address,
    not only virtual IPs.
  - Charon resolves hosts again during additional keying tries.
  - Fixed switching back to original address pair during MOBIKE.
  - When resending IKE_SA_INIT with a COOKIE charon reuses the previous
    DH value, as specified in RFC 5996.
    This has an effect on the lifecycle of diffie_hellman_t, see
    source:src/libcharon/sa/keymat.h#39 for details.
  - COOKIEs are now kept enabled a bit longer to avoid certain race
    conditions the commit message to 1b7debcc has some details.
  - The new stroke user-creds command allows to set username/password
    for a connection.
  - strongswan.conf option added to set identifier for syslog(3) logging.
  - Added a workaround for null-terminated XAuth secrets (as sent by
    Android 4).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  3 00:10:34 UTC 2012 - tabraham@novell.com

- Updated to strongSwan 4.6.2 release:
  Changes in 4.6.2:
  - Upgraded the TCG IF-IMC and IF-IMV C API to the upcoming version 1.3
    which supports IF-TNCCS 2.0 long message types, the exclusive flags
    and multiple IMC/IMV IDs. Both the TNC Client and Server as well as
    the "Test", "Scanner", and "Attestation" IMC/IMV pairs were updated.
  - Fully implemented the "TCG Attestation PTS Protocol: Binding to IF-M"
    standard (TLV-based messages only). TPM-based remote attestation of
    Linux IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) possible. Measurement
    reference values are automatically stored in an SQLite database.
  - The EAP-RADIUS authentication backend supports RADIUS accounting. It sends
    start/stop messages containing Username, Framed-IP and Input/Output-Octets
    attributes and has been tested against FreeRADIUS and Microsoft NPS.
  - Added support for PKCS#8 encoded private keys via the libstrongswan
    pkcs8 plugin.  This is the default format used by some OpenSSL tools since
    version 1.0.0 (e.g. openssl req with -keyout).
  - Added session resumption support to the strongSwan TLS stack.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 15 13:31:40 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to strongSwan 4.6.1 release:
  Changes in 4.6.1:
  - Because of changing checksums before and after installation which caused
    the integrity tests to fail we avoided directly linking libsimaka,
    libtls and libtnccs to those libcharon plugins which make use of these
    dynamiclibraries.
    Instead we linked the libraries to the charon daemon. Unfortunately
    Ubuntu 11.10 activated the --as-needed ld option which discards explicit
    links to dynamic libraries that are not actually used by the charon
    daemon itself, thus causing failures during the loading of the plugins
    which depend on these libraries for resolving external symbols.
  - Therefore our approach of computing  integrity checksums for plugins had
    to be changed radically by moving the hash generation from the
    compilation to the post-installation phase.
  Changes in 4.6.0:
  - The new libstrongswan certexpire plugin collects expiration information
    of all used certificates and exports them to CSV files. It either
    directly exports them or uses cron style scheduling for batch exports.
  - Starter passes unresolved hostnames to charon, allowing it to do name
    resolution not before the connection attempt. This is especially useful
    with connections between hosts using dynamic IP addresses.
    Thanks to Mirko Parthey for the initial patch.
  - The android plugin can now be used without the Android frontend patch
    and provides DNS server registration and logging to logcat.
  - Pluto and starter (plus stroke and whack) have been ported to Android.
  - Support for ECDSA private and public key operations has been added to
    the pkcs11 plugin.  The plugin now also provides DH and ECDH via PKCS#11
    and can use tokens as random number generators (RNG).  By default only
    private key operations are enabled, more advanced features have to be
    enabled by their option in strongswan.conf.  This also applies to public
    key operations (even for keys not stored on the token) which were
    enabled by default before.
  - The libstrongswan plugin system now supports detailed plugin
    dependencies. Many plugins have been extended to export its capabilities
    and requirements. This allows the plugin loader to resolve plugin
    loading order automatically, and in future releases, to dynamically load
    the required features on demand.
    Existing third party plugins are source (but not binary) compatible if
    they properly initialize the new get_features() plugin function to NULL.
  - The tnc-ifmap plugin implements a TNC IF-MAP 2.0 client which can
    deliver metadata about IKE_SAs via a SOAP interface to a MAP server.
    The tnc-ifmap plugin requires the Apache Axis2/C library.
- Merged patches, changed strongswan-doc to be a noarch package.

Thu Sep  8 16:06:46 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to strongSwan 4.5.3 release, changes overview since 4.5.2:
  * Our private libraries (e.g. libstrongswan) are not installed directly in
    prefix/lib anymore. Instead a subdirectory is used (prefix/lib/ipsec/ by
    default). The plugins directory is also moved from libexec/ipsec/ to that
    directory.
  * The dynamic IMC/IMV libraries were moved from the plugins directory to
    a new imcvs directory in the prefix/lib/ipsec/ subdirectory.
  * Job priorities were introduced to prevent thread starvation caused by too
    many threads handling blocking operations (such as CRL fetching).
  * Two new strongswan.conf options allow to fine-tune performance on IKEv2
    gateways by dropping IKE_SA_INIT requests on high load.
  * IKEv2 charon daemon supports PASS and DROP shunt policies
    preventing traffic to go through IPsec connections. Installation of the
    shunt policies either via the XFRM netfilter or PFKEYv2 IPsec kernel
    interfaces.
  * The history of policies installed in the kernel is now tracked so that e.g.
    trap policies are correctly updated when reauthenticated SAs are terminated.
  * IMC/IMV Scanner pair implementing the RFC 5792 PA-TNC (IF-M) protocol.
    Using "netstat -l" the IMC scans open listening ports on the TNC client
    and sends a port list to the IMV which based on a port policy decides if
    the client is admitted to the network.
  * IMC/IMV Test pair implementing the RFC 5792 PA-TNC (IF-M) protocol.
  * The IKEv2 close action does not use the same value as the ipsec.conf dpdaction
    setting, but the value defined by its own closeaction keyword. The action
    is triggered if the remote peer closes a CHILD_SA unexpectedly.
- Fixed some fmt warnings in libchecksum, adopted paths in the spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated to strongSwan 4.5.2 release, changes overview since 4.5.1:
  * The whitelist plugin for the IKEv2 daemon maintains an in-memory identity
    whitelist. Any connection attempt of peers not whitelisted will get rejected.
    The 'ipsec whitelist' utility provides a simple command line frontend for
    whitelist administration.
  * The duplicheck plugin provides a specialized form of duplicate checking,
    doing a liveness check on the old SA and optionally notify a third party
    application about detected duplicates.
  * The coupling plugin permanently couples two or more devices by limiting
    authentication to previously used certificates.
  * In the case that the peer config and child config don't have the same name
    (usually in SQL database defined connections), ipsec up|route <peer config>
    starts|routes all associated child configs and ipsec up|route <child config>
    only starts|routes the specific child config.
  * fixed the encoding and parsing of X.509 certificate policy statements (CPS).
  * Duncan Salerno contributed the eap-sim-pcsc plugin implementing a
    pcsc-lite based SIM card backend.
  * The eap-peap plugin implements the EAP PEAP protocol. Interoperates
    successfully with a FreeRADIUS server and Windows 7 Agile VPN clients.
  * The IKEv2 daemon charon rereads strongswan.conf on SIGHUP and instructs
    all plugins to reload. Currently only the eap-radius and the attr plugins
    support configuration reloading.
  * Added userland support to the IKEv2 daemon for Extended Sequence Numbers
    support coming with Linux 2.6.39. To enable ESN on a connection, add
    the 'esn' keyword to the proposal. The default proposal uses 32-bit sequence
    numbers only ('noesn'), and the same value is used if no ESN mode is
    specified. To negotiate ESN support with the peer, include both, e.g.
    esp=aes128-sha1-esn-noesn.
  * In addition to ESN, Linux 2.6.39 gained support for replay windows larger
    than 32 packets. The new global strongswan.conf option 'charon.replay_window'
    configures the size of the replay window, in packets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 14 10:59:32 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.5.1 release, changes overview since 4.5.0:
  * Implements RFC 5793 Posture Broker Protocol (BP)
  * Re-implemented TNCCS 1.1 protocol
  * Allows to store IKE and ESP proposals in an SQL database
  * Allows to store CRL and OCSP cert points in an SQL database
  * New 'include' statement in strongswan.conf allows recursions
  * Modifications of strongswan.conf parser, cause syntax attr plugin
    syntax changes.
  * ipsec listalgs now appends the plugin registering an algo
  * Adds support for Traffic Flow Confidentiality with Linux 2.6.38
  * New af-alg plugin allows to use new primitives in 2.6.38 crypto api
    and removes the need for additional userland implementations.
  * IKEv2 daemon supports the INITIAL_CONTACT notify
  * conftest conformance testing framework
  * new constraints plugin provides advanced X.509 constraint checking
  * left/rightauth ipsec.conf keywords accept minimum strengths
  * basic support for delta CRLs
  See the NEWS file or http://download.strongswan.org/CHANGES4.txt
  for a detailed description of the changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 22 09:05:30 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Cleaned up spec file; use with_mysql,sqlite,gcrypt,nm flags
- Disabled tests sub-package with load-tester and test-vectors
  plugins by default using a with_tests flag (causes load error
  in "ipsec pki" when enabled but the package is not installed).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 16 12:01:46 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.5.0 release, changes since 4.4.1 are:
  * IMPORTANT: the default keyexchange mode 'ike' is changing with
  release 4.5 from 'ikev1' to 'ikev2', thus commemorating the five
  year anniversary of the IKEv2 RFC 4306 and its mature successor
  RFC 5996. The time has definitively come for IKEv1 to go into
  retirement and to cede its place to the much more robust, powerful
  and versatile IKEv2 protocol!
  * Added new ctr, ccm and gcm plugins providing Counter, Counter
  with CBC-MAC and Galois/Counter Modes based on existing CBC
  implementations. These new plugins bring support for AES and
  Camellia Counter and CCM algorithms and the AES GCM algorithms
  for use in IKEv2.
  * The new pkcs11 plugin brings full Smartcard support to the IKEv2
  daemon and the pki utility using one or more PKCS#11 libraries. It
  currently supports RSA private and public key operations and loads
  X.509 certificates from tokens.
  * Implemented a general purpose TLS stack based on crypto and
  credential primitives of libstrongswan. libtls supports TLS
  versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, ECDHE-ECDSA/RSA, DHE-RSA and RSA key
  exchange algorithms and RSA/ECDSA based client authentication.
  * Based on libtls, the eap-tls plugin brings certificate based EAP
  authentication for client and server. It is compatible to Windows
  7 IKEv2 Smartcard authentication and the OpenSSL based FreeRADIUS
  EAP-TLS backend.
  * Implemented the TNCCS 1.1 Trusted Network Connect protocol using
  the libtnc library on the strongSwan client and server side via
  the tnccs_11 plugin and optionally connecting to a TNC@FHH-enhanced
  FreeRADIUS AAA server. Depending on the resulting TNC Recommendation,
  strongSwan clients are granted access to a network behind a
  strongSwan gateway (allow), are put into a remediation zone (isolate)
  or are blocked (none), respectively.
  Any number of Integrity Measurement Collector/Verifier pairs can be
  attached via the tnc-imc and tnc-imv charon plugins.
  * The IKEv1 daemon pluto now uses the same kernel interfaces as the
  IKEv2 daemon charon. As a result of this, pluto now supports xfrm
  marks which were introduced in charon with 4.4.1.
  * The RADIUS plugin eap-radius now supports multiple RADIUS servers
  for redundant setups. Servers are selected by a defined priority,
  server load and availability.
  * The simple led plugin controls hardware LEDs through the Linux LED
  subsystem. It currently shows activity of the IKE daemon and is a
  good example how to implement a simple event listener.
  * Improved MOBIKE behavior in several corner cases, for instance,
  if the initial responder moves to a different address.
  * Fixed left-/rightnexthop option, which was broken since 4.4.0.
  * Fixed a bug not releasing a virtual IP address to a pool if the
  XAUTH identity was different from the IKE identity.
  * Fixed the alignment of ModeConfig messages on 4-byte boundaries
  in the case where the attributes are not a multiple of 4 bytes
  (e.g. Cisco's UNITY_BANNER).
  * Fixed the interoperability of the socket_raw and socket_default
  charon plugins.
  * Added man page for strongswan.conf
- Adopted spec file, removed obsolete error range patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 10 11:43:38 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.4.1 release, changes since 4.4.0 are:
  * Support of xfrm marks in IPsec SAs and IPsec policies introduced
    with the Linux 2.6.34 kernel.
    For details see the example scenarios ikev2/nat-two-rw-mark,
    ikev2/rw-nat-mark-in-out and ikev2/net2net-psk-dscp.
  * The PLUTO_MARK_IN and PLUTO_ESP_ENC environment variables can be
    used in a user-specific updown script to set marks on inbound ESP
    or ESP_IN_UDP packets.
  * The openssl plugin now supports X.509 certificate and CRL functions.
  * OCSP/CRL checking in IKEv2 has been moved to the revocation plugin,
    enabled by default.
    Plase update manual load directives in strongswan.conf.
  * RFC3779 ipAddrBlock constraint checking has been moved to the
    addrblock plugin, disabled by default. Enable it and update manual
    load directives in strongswan.conf, if required.
  * The pki utility supports CRL generation using the --signcrl command.
  * The ipsec pki --self, --issue and --req commands now support output
    in PEM format using the --outform pem option.
  * The major refactoring of the IKEv1 Mode Config functionality now
    allows the transport and handling of any Mode Config attribute.
  * The RADIUS proxy plugin eap-radius now supports multiple servers.
    Configured servers are chosen randomly, with the option to prefer
    a specific server.  Non-responding servers are degraded by the
    selection process.
  * The ipsec pool tool manages arbitrary configuration attributes
    stored in an SQL database. ipsec pool --help gives the details.
  * The new eap-simaka-sql plugin acts as a backend for EAP-SIM and
    EAP-AKA, reading triplets/quintuplets from an SQL database.
  * The High Availability plugin now supports a HA enabled in-memory
    address pool and Node reintegration without IKE_SA rekeying. The
    latter allows clients without IKE_SA rekeying support to keep
    connected during reintegration. Additionally, many other issues
    have been fixed in the ha plugin.
  * Fixed a potential remote code execution vulnerability resulting
    from the misuse of snprintf(). The vulnerability is exploitable
    by unauthenticated users.
- Removed obsolete snprintf security fix, adopted spec file
- Enabled the eap-sim,eap-sim-file,eap-simaka-sql,eap-simaka-reauth,
  eap-simaka-pseudonym,eap-aka-3gpp2,md4,blowfish,addrblock plugins.
- Enabled the mysql, sqlite, load-tester and test-vectors plugins,
  that are packaged into separate mysql,sqlite,tests sub packages.
- Disabled sqlite plugin on SLE-10 -- sqlite3 lib is too old there.
- Applied patch by Jiri Bohac fixing error-type range in parsing of
  NOTIFY payloads (RFC 4306, section 3.10.1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  2 15:40:17 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Applied upstream patch fixing snprintf flaws in the strongSwan
  IKE daemons exploitable by unauthenticated attackers using a
  crafted certificate or identification payload (bnc#615915).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  2 14:16:18 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Added README.SUSE to source list in the spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 14 19:19:04 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.4.0 release, changes since 4.3.6 are:
  * The IKEv2 High Availability plugin has been integrated. It
  provides load sharing and failover capabilities in a cluster of
  currently two nodes, based on an extend ClusterIP kernel module.
  More information is available at
  http://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/HighAvailability.
  The development of the High Availability functionality was sponsored
  by secunet Security Networks AG.
  * Added IKEv1 and IKEv2 configuration support for the AES-GMAC
  authentication-only ESP cipher. Our aes_gmac kernel patch or a Linux
  2.6.34 kernel is required to make AES-GMAC available via the XFRM
  kernel interface.
  * Added support for Diffie-Hellman groups 22, 23 and 24 to the gmp,
  gcrypt and openssl plugins, usable by both pluto and charon. The new
  proposal keywords are modp1024s160, modp2048s224 and modp2048s256.
  Thanks to Joy Latten from IBM for her contribution.
  * The IKEv1 pluto daemon supports RAM-based virtual IP pools using
  the rightsourceip directive with a subnet from which addresses
  are allocated.
  * The ipsec pki --gen and --pub commands now allow the output of
  private and public keys in PEM format using the --outform pem
  command line option.
  * The new DHCP plugin queries virtual IP addresses for clients from
  a DHCP server using broadcasts, or a defined server using the
  charon.plugins.dhcp.server strongswan.conf option. DNS/WINS server
  information is additionally served to clients if the DHCP server
  provides such information. The plugin is used in ipsec.conf
  configurations having rightsourceip set to %dhcp.
  * A new plugin called farp fakes ARP responses for virtual IP
  addresses handed out to clients from the IKEv2 daemon charon. The
  plugin lets a road-warrior act as a client on the local LAN if it
  uses a virtual IP from the responders subnet, e.g. acquired using
  the DHCP plugin.
  * The existing IKEv2 socket implementations have been migrated to
  the socket-default and the socket-raw plugins.  The new
  socket-dynamic plugin binds sockets dynamically to ports configured
  via the left-/rightikeport ipsec.conf connection parameters.
  * The android charon plugin stores received DNS server information
  as "net.dns" system properties, as used by the Android platform.
- Splitted package into strongswan-ipsec, that install the traditional
  ipsec service starter scripts, -ikev1 and -ikev2 installing daemons
  and -libs0, that contains the library and plugins.
- Enabled dhcp, farp, ha, socket-dynamic, agent, eap and sql plugins.
- Enabled NetworkManager nm plugin in a separate strongswan-nm package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  2 21:42:10 CET 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.3.6 release, changes since 4.3.4 are:
  * The IKEv2 daemon supports RFC 3779 IP address block constraints
  carried as a critical X.509v3 extension in the peer certificate.
  * The ipsec pool --add|del dns|nbns command manages DNS and NBNS
  name server entries that are sent via the IKEv1 Mode Config or
  IKEv2 Configuration Payload to remote clients.
  * The Camellia cipher can be used as an IKEv1 encryption algorithm.
  * The IKEv1 and IKEV2 daemons now check certificate path length
  constraints.
  * The new ipsec.conf conn option "inactivity" closes a CHILD_SA if
  no traffic was sent or received within the given interval. To close
  the complete IKE_SA if its only CHILD_SA was inactive, set the
  global strongswan.conf option "charon.inactivity_close_ike" to yes.
  * More detailed IKEv2 EAP payload information in debug output
  * IKEv2 EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA share joint libsimaka library
  * Added required userland changes for proper SHA256 and SHA384/512
  in ESP that will be introduced with Linux 2.6.33.
  The "sha256"/"sha2_256" keyword now configures the kernel with 128
  bit truncation, not the non-standard 96 bit truncation used by
  previous releases. To use the old 96 bit truncation scheme, the new
  "sha256_96" proposal keyword has been introduced.
  * Fixed IPComp in tunnel mode, stripping out the duplicated outer
  header. This change makes IPcomp tunnel mode connections
  incompatible with previous releases; disable compression on such
  tunnels.
  * Fixed BEET mode connections on recent kernels by installing SAs
  with appropriate traffic selectors, based on a patch by Michael
  Rossberg.
  * Using extensions (such as BEET mode) and crypto algorithms (such
  as twofish, serpent, sha256_96) allocated in the private use space
  now require that we know its meaning, i.e. we are talking to
  strongSwan. Use the new "charon.send_vendor_id" option in
  strongswan.conf to let the remote peer know this is the case.
  * Experimental support for draft-eronen-ipsec-ikev2-eap-auth, where
  the responder omits public key authentication in favor of a mutual
  authentication method. To enable EAP-only authentication, set
  rightauth=eap on the responder to rely only on the MSK constructed
  AUTH payload. This not-yet standardized extension requires the
  strongSwan vendor ID introduced above.
  * The IKEv1 daemon ignores the Juniper SRX notification type 40001,
  thus allowing interoperability.
  * The IKEv1 pluto daemon can now use SQL-based address pools to
  deal out virtual IP addresses as a Mode Config server. The pool
  capability has been migrated from charon's sql plugin to a new
  attr-sql plugin which is loaded by libstrongswan and which can be
  used by both daemons either with a SQLite or MySQL database and the
  corresponding plugin.
  * Plugin names have been streamlined: EAP plugins now have a dash
  after eap (e.g. eap-sim), as it is used with the --enable-eap-sim
  ./configure option.
  Plugin configuration sections in strongswan.conf now use the same
  name as the plugin itself (i.e. with a dash). Make sure to update
  "load" directives and the affected plugin sections in existing
  strongswan.conf files.
  * The private/public key parsing and encoding has been split up
  into separate pkcs1, pgp, pem and dnskey plugins. The public key
  implementation plugins gmp, gcrypt and openssl can all make use
  of them.
  * The EAP-AKA plugin can use different backends for USIM/quintuplet
  calculations, very similar to the EAP-SIM plugin. The existing 3GPP2
  software implementation has been migrated to a separate plugin.
  * The IKEv2 daemon charon gained basic PGP support. It can use
  locally installed peer certificates and can issue signatures based
  on RSA private keys.
  * The new 'ipsec pki' tool provides a set of commands to maintain a
  public key infrastructure. It currently supports operations to
  create RSA and ECDSA private/public keys, calculate fingerprints and
  issue or verify certificates.
  * Charon uses a monotonic time source for statistics and job
  queueing, behaving correctly if the system time changes (e.g. when
  using NTP).
  * In addition to time based rekeying, charon supports IPsec SA
  lifetimes based on processed volume or number of packets.
  They new ipsec.conf paramaters 'lifetime' (an alias to 'keylife'),
  'lifebytes' and 'lifepackets' handle SA timeouts, while the
  parameters 'margintime' (an alias to rekeymargin), 'marginbytes'
  and 'marginpackets' trigger the rekeying before a SA expires.
  The existing parameter 'rekeyfuzz' affects all margins.
  * If no CA/Gateway certificate is specified in the NetworkManager
  plugin, charon uses a set of trusted root certificates preinstalled
  by distributions. The directory containing CA certificates can be
  specified using the --with-nm-ca-dir=path configure option.
  * Fixed the encoding of the Email relative distinguished name in
  left|rightid statements.
  * Fixed the broken parsing of PKCS#7 wrapped certificates by the
  pluto daemon.
  * Fixed smartcard-based authentication in the pluto daemon which
  was broken by the ECDSA support introduced with the 4.3.2 release.
  * A patch contributed by Heiko Hund fixes mixed IPv6 in IPv4 and
  vice versa tunnels established with the IKEv1 pluto daemon.
  * The pluto daemon now uses the libstrongswan x509 plugin for
  certificates and CRls and the struct id type was replaced by
  identification_t used by charon and the libstrongswan library.
- Removed obsolete load_secrets patches, refreshed modprobe patch.
- Corrected a time_t cast reported by rpmlint (timer.c:51)
- Disabled libtoolize call and the gcrypt plugin on SLE 10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  4 12:56:59 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed open failure debug message in load_secrets

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 23:44:37 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Applied patch fixing locking in ipsec.secrets inclusion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 31 16:06:13 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.3.4 release:
  * IKEv2 charon daemon ported to FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Installation
    details can be found on wiki.strongswan.org.
  * ipsec statusall shows the number of bytes transmitted and received
    over ESP connections configured by the IKEv2 charon daemon.
  * The IKEv2 charon daemon supports include files in ipsec.secrets.
- Removed obsolete ipsec.secrets include patch (bnc#524799)
  and patch to avoid libchecksum version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  7 11:44:30 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Applied patch implementing ipsec.secrets "include" directive
  support in charon (http://wiki.strongswan.org/issues/show/82,
  bnc#524799).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 27 13:40:57 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.3.3 release:
  * The configuration option --enable-integrity-test plus the
  strongswan.conf option libstrongswan.integrity_test = yes
  activate integrity tests of the IKE daemons charon and pluto,
  libstrongswan and all loaded plugins. Thus dynamic library
  misconfigurations and non-malicious file manipulations can be
  reliably detected.
  * The new default setting libstrongswan.ecp_x_coordinate_only=yes
  allows IKEv1 interoperability with MS Windows using the ECP DH
  groups 19 and 20.
  * The IKEv1 pluto daemon now supports the AES-CCM and AES-GCM ESP
  authenticated encryption algorithms.
  * The IKEv1 pluto daemon now supports V4 OpenPGP keys.
  * The RDN parser vulnerability discovered by Orange Labs research
  team was not completely fixed in version 4.3.2. Some more
  modifications had to be applied to the asn1_length() function to
  make it robust.
- Enabled --enable-integrity-test configure option (new feature).
- Removed patch to avoid plugin versions (accepted by upstream)
  and added patch to avoid version for new libchecksum library.
- Added -Wno-pointer-sign -Wno-strict-aliasing CFLAGS in the spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 10 11:04:44 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.3.2 release, that fixes two asn1 parser
  DoS vulnerabilities and provides several new features, e.g.:
  * The new gcrypt plugin provides symmetric cipher, hasher, RNG,
  Diffie-Hellman and RSA crypto primitives using the LGPL licensed
  GNU gcrypt library.
  * libstrongswan features an integrated crypto selftest framework
  for registered algorithms. The test-vector plugin provides a first
  set of test vectors and allows pluto and charon to rely on tested
  crypto algorithms.
  * pluto can now use all libstrongswan plugins with the exception
  of x509 and xcbc. Thanks to the openssl plugin, the ECP Diffie-
  Hellman groups 19, 20, 21, 25, and 26 as well as ECDSA-256,
  ECDSA-384, and ECDSA-521 authentication can be used with IKEv1.
  * Applying their fuzzing tool, the Orange Labs vulnerability
  research team found another two DoS vulnerabilities, one in the
  rather old ASN.1 parser of Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs)
  and a second one in the conversion of ASN.1 UTCTIME and
  GENERALIZEDTIME strings to a time_t value.
  * The nm plugin now passes DNS/NBNS server information to
  NetworkManager, allowing a gateway administrator to set DNS/NBNS
  configuration on clients dynamically.
  * The nm plugin also accepts CA certificates for gateway
  authentication. If a CA certificate is configured, strongSwan uses
  the entered gateway address as its idenitity, requiring the gateways
  certificate to contain the same as subjectAltName.
  This allows a gateway administrator to deploy the same
  certificates to Windows 7 and NetworkManager clients.
  * The command ipsec purgeike deletes IKEv2 SAs that don't have a
  CHILD SA.
  The command ipsec down <conn>{n} deletes CHILD SA instance n of
  connection <conn> whereas ipsec down <conn>{*} deletes all CHILD
  SA instances.
  The command ipsec down <conn>[n] deletes IKE SA instance n of
  connection <conn> plus dependent CHILD SAs whereas ipsec down
  <conn>[*] deletes all IKE SA instances of connection <conn>.
  * Fixed a regression introduced in 4.3.0 where EAP authentication
  calculated the AUTH payload incorrectly. Further, the EAP-MSCHAPv2
  MSK key derivation has been updated to be compatible with the
  Windows 7 Release Candidate.
  * Refactored installation of triggering policies. Routed policies
  are handled outside of IKE_SAs to keep them installed in any case.
  A tunnel gets established only once, even if initiation is delayed
  due network outages.
  * Improved the handling of multiple acquire signals triggered by
  the kernel.
  * Fixed two DoS vulnerabilities in the charon daemon that were
  discovered by fuzzing techniques:
  1) Sending a malformed IKE_SA_INIT request leaved an incomplete
  state which caused a null pointer dereference if a subsequent
  CREATE_CHILD_SA request was sent.
  2) Sending an IKE_AUTH request with either a missing TSi or TSr
  payload caused a null pointer derefence because the checks for
  TSi and TSr were interchanged.
  The IKEv2 fuzzer used was developped by the Orange Labs
  vulnerability research team.  The tool was initially written
  by Gabriel Campana and is now maintained by Laurent Butti.
  * Added support for AES counter mode in ESP in IKEv2 using the
  proposal keywords aes128ctr, aes192ctr and aes256ctr.
  * Further progress in refactoring pluto: Use of the curl and ldap
  plugins for fetching crls and OCSP. Use of the random plugin to
  get keying material from /dev/random or /dev/urandom. Use of the
  openssl plugin as an alternative to the aes, des, sha1, sha2, and
  md5 plugins. The blowfish, twofish, and serpent encryption plugins
  are now optional and are not enabled by default.
- Enabled new gcrypt plugin
- Adopted spec file and modprobe to syslog patch
- Removed obsolete getline glibc collision patch
- Added patch to avoid library version for plugins (rpmlint).
- Replaced update-dns-server patch with a --with-resolv-conf.
- Removed restart_on_update from spec file (see bnc#450390).

- Applied fix for a Denial-of-Service vulnerability where receiving
  a malformed IKE_SA_INIT request leaves an incomplete state which
  causes a crash of the IKEv2 charon while dereferencing a NULL
  pointer if a subsequent CREATE_CHILD_SA is received (bnc#507742).
- Applied fix for a Denial-of-Service vulnerability where receiving
  a malformed IKE_AUTH request with either a missing TSi or TSr
  traffic selector payload causes a crash of the IKEv2 charon while
  dereferencing a NULL pointer because the NULL pointer checks of
  TSi and TSr before destruction were erroneously swapped
  (bnc#507742).

Tue Mar 31 11:19:03 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to strongSwan 4.2.14 release that fixes a grave DPD
  denial of service vulnerability registered as CVE-2009-0790,
  that had been slumbering in the code for many years:
  * A vulnerability in the Dead Peer Detection (RFC 3706) code
    was found by Gerd v. Egidy <gerd.von.egidy@intra2net.com> of
    Intra2net AG affecting all Openswan and strongSwan releases.
    A malicious (or expired ISAKMP) R_U_THERE or R_U_THERE_ACK
    Dead Peer Detection packet can cause the pluto IKE daemon to
    crash and restart. No authentication or encryption is required
    to trigger this bug. One spoofed UDP packet can cause the pluto
    IKE daemon to restart and be unresponsive for a few seconds
    while restarting. This DPD null state vulnerability has been
    officially registered as CVE-2009-0790 and is fixed by this
    release.
  * The new server-side EAP RADIUS plugin (--enable-eap-radius)
    relays EAP messages to and from a RADIUS server. Succesfully
    tested with with a freeradius server using EAP-MD5 and EAP-SIM.
  * ASN.1 to time_t conversion caused a time wrap-around for dates
    after Jan 18 03:14:07 UTC 2038 on 32-bit platforms.
    As a workaround such dates are set to the maximum representable
    time, i.e. Jan 19 03:14:07 UTC 2038.
  * Distinguished Names containing wildcards (*) are not sent in the
    IDr payload anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 20 09:27:06 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 4.2.8 release:
  * IKEv2 charon daemon supports authentication based on raw public
  keys stored in the SQL database backend. The ipsec listpubkeys
  command lists the available raw public keys via the stroke
  interface.
  * Several MOBIKE improvements: Detect changes in NAT mappings in
  DPD exchanges, handle events if kernel detects NAT mapping changes
  in UDP-encapsulated ESP packets (requires kernel patch), reuse old
  addesses in MOBIKE updates as long as possible and other fixes.
  * Fixed a bug in addr_in_subnet() which caused insertion of wrong
  source routes for destination subnets having netwmasks not being a
  multiple of 8 bits.  Thanks go to Wolfgang Steudel, TU Ilmenau for
  reporting this bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 14 16:29:59 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Applied fix for addr_in_subnet() extracted from strongswan-4.2.8
  which caused insertion of wrong source routes for destination
  subnets having netwmasks not being a multiple of 8 bits.
  Thanks go to Wolfgang Steudel, TU Ilmenau for reporting this bug.
  (bnc#435200)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 10 08:08:35 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Applied fix for a Denial-of-Service vulnerability where an
  IKE_SA_INIT message with a KE payload containing zeroes only can
  cause a crash of the IKEv2 charon daemon due to a NULL pointer
  returned by the mpz_export() function of the GNU Multi Precision
  (GMP) library. Thanks go to Mu Dynamics Research Labs for making
  us aware of this problem. (bnc#435194)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 28 14:31:49 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed to use --enable-curl instead of --enable-http as before
- Enabled the OpenSSL crypto plugin in the spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 28 09:48:14 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 4.2.6 release, fixing bugs and offering a lot of new
  features comparing to the last version provided by this package.
  Most important are:
  * A NetworkManager plugin allows GUI-based configuration of
  road-warrior clients in a simple way. It features X509 based
  gateway authentication and EAP client authentication, tunnel
  setup/teardown and storing passwords in the Gnome Keyring.
  * A new EAP-GTC plugin implements draft-sheffer-ikev2-gtc-00.txt
  and allows username/password authentication against any PAM
  service on the gateway. The new EAP method interacts nicely with
  the NetworkManager plugin and allows client authentication against
  e.g. LDAP.
  * Improved support for the EAP-Identity method. The new ipsec.conf
  eap_identity parameter defines an additional identity to pass to
  the server in EAP authentication.
  * Fixed two multithreading deadlocks occurring when starting up
  several hundred tunnels concurrently.
  * Fixed the --enable-integrity-test configure option which
  computes a SHA-1 checksum over the libstrongswan library.
  * Consistent logging of IKE and CHILD SAs at the audit (AUD) level.
  * Improved the performance of the SQL-based virtual IP address pool
  by introducing an additional addresses table. The leases table
  storing only history information has become optional and can be
  disabled by setting charon.plugins.sql.lease_history = no in
  strongswan.conf.
  * The XFRM_STATE_AF_UNSPEC flag added to xfrm.h allows IPv4-over-IPv6
  and IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels with the 2.6.26 and later Linux kernels.
  * management of different virtual IP pools for different network
  interfaces have become possible.
  * fixed a bug which prevented the assignment of more than 256
  virtual IP addresses from a pool managed by an sql database.
  * fixed a bug which did not delete own IPCOMP SAs in the kernel.
  * The openssl plugin supports the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
  groups 19, 20, 21, 25, and 26 and ECDSA authentication using
  elliptic curve X.509 certificates.
  * Fixed a bug in stroke which caused multiple charon threads to
  close the file descriptors during packet transfers over the stroke
  socket.
  * ESP sequence numbers are now migrated in IPsec SA updates handled
  by MOBIKE. Works only with Linux kernels >= 2.6.17.
  * Fixed a number of minor bugs that where discovered during the 4th
  IKEv2 interoperability workshop in San Antonio, TX.
  * Plugins for libstrongswan and charon can optionally be loaded
  according to a configuration in strongswan.conf. Most components
  provide a "load = " option followed by a space separated list of
  plugins to load. This allows e.g. the fallback from a hardware
  crypto accelerator to to software-based crypto plugins.
  * Charons SQL plugin has been extended by a virtual IP address pool.
  Configurations with a rightsourceip=%poolname setting query a
  SQLite or MySQL database for leases. The "ipsec pool" command helps
  in administrating the pool database. See ipsec pool --help for the
  available options
  * The Authenticated Encryption Algorithms AES-CCM-8/12/16 and
  AES-GCM-8/12/16 for ESP are now supported starting with the Linux
  2.6.25 kernel. The syntax is e.g. esp=aes128ccm12 or esp=aes256gcm16.
- Added patch disabling direct modifications of resolv.conf; has to
  be replaced by a netconfig call.
- Added patch adding a missed file name argument in printf call in the
  scripts/thread_analysis.c file -- resulting binary is not installed.
- Removed obsolete patches crash_badcfg_reload and old-caps-version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 22:40:31 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Added fix that explicitly enables version 1 linux capabilities
  on version 2 systems to aviod that the charon and pluto daemons
  exit because of failed capset call (bnc#404989).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 19 16:17:16 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Applied fix (strongswan_crash_badcfg_reload.dif) to avoid
  a crash after reloading with bad config (bnc#392062).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 23 14:28:41 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 4.2.1 release. A lot of code refactoring in the 4.2
  release provides much more modularity and therefore much more
  extensiblity and offers the following new features:
  * libstrongswan has been modularized to attach crypto algorithms,
  credential implementations (secret and private keys, certificates)
  and http/ldap fetchers dynamically through plugins.
  * A relational database API that uses pluggable database providers
  was added to libstrongswan including plugins for MySQL and SQLite.
  * The IKEv2 keying charon daemon has become more extensible. Generic
  plugins can provide arbitrary interfaces to credential stores and
  connection management interfaces. Also any EAP method can be added.
  * The authentication and credential framework in charon has been
  heavily refactored to support modular credential providers, proper
  CERTREQ/CERT payload exchanges and extensible authorization rules.
  * Support for "Hash and URL" encoded certificate payloads has been
  implemented in the IKEv2 daemon charon.
  * The IKEv2 daemon charon now supports the "uniqueids" option to
  close multiple IKE_SAs with the same peer.
  * The crypto factory in libstrongswan additionally supports random
  number generators. Plugins may provide other sources of randomness.
  * Extended the credential framework by a caching option to allow
  plugins persistent caching of fetched credentials.
  * The new trust chain verification introduced in 4.2.0 has been
  parallelized. Threads fetching CRL or OCSP information no longer
  block other threads.
  * A new IKEv2 configuration attribute framework has been introduced
  allowing plugins to provide virtual IP addresses, and in the future,
  other configuration attribute services (e.g. DNS/WINS servers).
  * The stroke plugin has been extended to provide virtual IP addresses
  from a simple pool defined in ipsec.conf.
  * Fixed compilation on uClibc and a couple of other minor bugs.
  * The IKEv1 pluto daemon now supports the ESP encryption algorithm
  CAMELLIA with key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits, as well as the
  authentication algorithm AES_XCBC_MAC.
- Applied a small patch defining _GNU_SOURCE for struct in6_pktinfo
  and adding inclusion of limits.h for PATH_MAX availability.
- Added rpmlintrc file and a libtoolize call to the spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 19 11:44:03 CET 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 4.1.11 maintenance release, providing following fixes:
  * IKE rekeying in NAT situations did not inherit the NAT conditions
  to the rekeyed IKE_SA so that the UDP encapsulation was lost with
  the next CHILD_SA rekeying.
  * Wrong type definition of the next_payload variable in id_payload.c
  caused an INVALID_SYNTAX error on PowerPC platforms.
  * Implemented IKEv2 EAP-SIM server and client test modules that use
  triplets stored in a file. For details on the configuration see
  the scenario 'ikev2/rw-eap-sim-rsa'.
- The 4.1.10 final version, declared upstream as "Fully tested support
  of IPv6 IPsec tunnel connections", fixes ordering error in oscp cache,
  IPv6 defaults of the nexthop parameter, adds support for new EAP
  modules [disabled in this build] and obsoletes our strongswan_path
  and strongswan_ipsec_script_msg patches.
- Removed a sed call from init script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  8 13:03:42 CET 2007 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to 4.1.9 final, including all our patches.
- Changed init script to use ipsec cmd using LSB codes now.
- Added strongswan_path.dif setting a PATH in scripts (updown).
- Added strongswan_ipsec_script_msg.dif for consistent look of
  ipsec script messages.
- Added strongswan_modprobe_syslog.dif redirecting modprobe
  output to syslog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 26 10:19:40 CET 2007 - mt@suse.de

- Renamed charon plugins to avoid rpm conflicts with existing
  libraries (libstroke). Patch: strongswan-libconflicts.dif
- Added init script. Template file: strongswan.init.in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 22 10:25:56 CET 2007 - mt@suse.de

- Initial, unfinished package
