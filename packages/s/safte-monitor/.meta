  <title>Linux SAF-TE SCSI enclosure monitor</title>
  <description>saftemon reads disk enclosure status information from SAF-TE (SCSI
Accessible Fault Tolerant Enclosures). SAF-TE is a component of SES
(SCSI Enclosure Services) which is common on most SCSI disk enclosures
these days. saftemon can monitor multiple SAF-TE devices and will
automatically detect them.

The information retrieved includes power supply, temperature, audible
alarm, drive faults, array critical/failed/rebuilding state and door
lock status. saftemon logs changes in the status of these enclosure
elements to syslog and can optionally execute an alert help program
with details of the component failure.</description>
