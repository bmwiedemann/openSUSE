  <title>Hardware health monitoring for Linux</title>
  <description>This package includes programs that show data from some sensor chips. 
The interface /proc/bus/i2c/ is provided by loading kernel modules.
Which modules to load can be interactively detected as root by calling
/usr/sbin/sensors-detect. Warning, before using the sensors the default
configuration in /etc/sensors.conf has to be checked and changed to fit
the actual set up of the mainboard and the BIOS used on that specific
mainboard!</description>
