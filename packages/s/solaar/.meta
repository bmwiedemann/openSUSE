  <title>Linux devices manager for the Logitech Unifying Receiver</title>
  <description>Solaar is a Linux device manager for Logitechâ€™s Unifying Receiver peripherals. It is able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for most devices read battery status.

It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI. Both are able to list the devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each device, and also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.</description>
