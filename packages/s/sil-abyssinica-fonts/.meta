  <title>smart Unicode font for the Ethiopic script (Amharic)</title>
  <description>The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of
Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F) was added to Unicode
3.0.  Ethiopic Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic Extended
(U+2D80..U+2DDF) were added to Unicode 4.1. Abyssinica SIL supports all
Ethiopic characters which are in Unicode including the Unicode 4.1
extensions. Some languages of Ethiopia are not yet able to be fully
represented in Unicode and, where necessary, we have included
non-Unicode characters in the Private Use Area (see Private-use (PUA)
characters supported by Abyssinica SIL).

Abyssinica SIL is based on Ethiopic calligraphic traditions. This
release is a regular typeface, with no bold or italic version available
or planned.
