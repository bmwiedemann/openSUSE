- Update to version 5.1.5:
  * ScintillaEditPy, Python bindings for Qt using PySide, has been
    removed.
  * When calling SCI_GETTEXT, SCI_GETSELTEXT, and SCI_GETCURLINE
    with a NULL buffer argument to discover the length that should
    be allocated, do not include the terminating NUL in the
    returned value.
  * Fix assertion failure with autocompletion list when order is
    SC_ORDER_CUSTOM or SC_ORDER_PERFORMSORT and the list is empty.
    Bug #2294.
  * On GTK using Wayland, display autocompletion with window on a
    secondary monitor. Bug #2296, Bug #2261. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 19 12:36:34 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.4:
  * Add DEL to standard set of space characters for word
    operations.
  * Add CARETSTYLE_CURSES to draw more than 1 caret on curses
    terminal.
  * On GTK, fix primary selection paste within same instance. Bug
    #2287.
  * On GTK, fix potential crash when closing Scintilla instances
    due to releasing global settings object.
  * GetLineEndTypesSupported returns LineEndType, not int. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 12:53:03 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.3:
  * Fix bug with SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED on Cocoa that led to
    incorrect layout with overlapping text.
- Changes from version 5.1.2:
  * Add SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED which can be used to optimize
    fonts that are monospaced over the ASCII graphics characters.
  * Add SC_ELEMENT_FOLD_LINE to set the colour of fold lines. Add
    SC_ELEMENT_HIDDEN_LINE to show where lines are hidden. Feature
    #1241, Feature #382, Feature #203.
  * Add SCI_SETCARETLINEHIGHLIGHTSUBLINE to highlight just the
    subline containing the caret instead of the whole document
    line. Feature #841.
  * Allow SCI_HIDELINES to hide the first line or all lines which
    can be useful for filtered views.
  * Make negative settings for extra ascent and descent safer by
    ensuring calculated ascent and thus line height is at least 1
    pixel.
  * Fix display of fold lines when wrapped so they are only drawn
    once per line, not on each subline.
  * Fix crash with too many subexpressions in regular expression
    search with SCFIND_CXX11REGEX. Bug #2281.
  * On GTK, fix the line spacing so that underscores and accents
    are visible for some fonts such as DejaVu Sans Mono 10.
  * On GTK, respond to changes in system font scaling by clearing
    any cached layout data. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 28 11:48:25 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.1:
  * In DBCS encodings, treat valid DBCS lead byte followed by
    invalid trail byte as single byte. Feature #1408.
  * Searching was optimized for documents that contain mostly
    ASCII text and is often 2-3 times faster. Feature #1381.
  * Word searching behaves more consistently at start and end of
    document.
  * Add SCI_ALLOCATELINES to allocate indices to hold some number
    of lines. This can decrease reallocation overhead when the
    application can count or estimate the number of lines in huge
    files. Feature #1370.
  * Add SCI_AUTOCSETOPTIONS to allow choosing a non-resizeable
    autocompletion list on Win32. Feature #1284.
- Minor rebase of scintilla-shared.patch to apply cleanly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 27 02:25:36 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.0:
  * Add SciFnDirectStatus, a direct access function which also
    returns status. It can be retrieved with
    SCI_GETDIRECTSTATUSFUNCTION. This can avoid calling
    SCI_GETSTATUS after every API to determine failure so can
    improve performance.
  * Add more type-safe wrappers to the API. These are defined in
    include/ScintillaCall.h and implemented in
    call/ScintillaCall.cxx. ScintillaCall throws
    Scintilla::Failure exceptions when a call fails.
  * Add APIs for setting appearance (traditional blob or plain
    text) and colour of representations and support setting a
    representation for the "\r\n" line end sequence.
  * Add SCI_REPLACERECTANGULAR to insert text like a rectangular
    paste.
  * Fixed bug with SCI_GETLASTCHILD. Bug #2260.
  * Fixed gcc link-time-optimization (LTO) compilation. Bug #2259. 
- Refresh scintilla-shared.patch to apply against updated version.
- Install license file using %license.
- Drop fdupes form BuildRequires: no longer needed.
- Minor specfile cleanups.

  * Added a caret line frame as an alternative visual for
    highlighting the caret line.
  * Added "Reverse Selected Lines" feature.
  * SciTE adds "Select All Bookmarks" command.
  * SciTE adds a save.path.suggestion setting to suggest a file
    name when saving an unnamed buffer.
  * Updated case conversion and character categories to Unicode 9.
  * The Baan lexer recognizes numeric literals in a more compliant
    manner including hexadecimal numbers and exponentials.
  * The Bash lexer recognizes strings in lists in more cases. Bug
    #1944.
  * The Fortran lexer recognizes a preprocessor line after a line
    continuation &. Bug #1935.
  * The Fortran folder can fold comments. Bug #1936.
  * The PowerShell lexer recognizes escaped quotes in strings. Bug
    #1929.
  * The Python lexer recognizes identifiers more accurately when
    they include non-ASCII characters.
  * The Python folder treats comments at the end of the file as
    separate from the preceding structure.
  * The YAML lexer recognizes comments in more situations and
    styles a "..." line like a "---" line. Bug #1931.
  * Update scroll bar when annotations added, removed, or
    visibility changed. Feature #1187.
  * Canceling modes with the Esc key preserves a rectangular
    selection. Bug #1940.
  * Builds are made with a sorted list of lexers to be more
    reproducible. Bug #1946.
  * SciTE examines at most 1 MB of a file to automatically
    determine indentation for indent.auto to avoid a lengthy pause
    when loading very large files.
  * SciTE user interface uses lighter colours and fewer 3D
    elements to match current desktop environments.
  * SciTE sets buffer dirty and shows message when file deleted if
    load.on.activate on.
  * SciTE on Windows Find strip Find button works in incremental
    no-close mode. Bug #1926.

- updated to version 2.01
  - 2.01 changes
    - Fix to positioning rectangular paste when viewing line ends.
    - Don't insert new lines and indentation for line ends at end of
      rectangular paste.
    - When not in additional selection typing mode, cutting a 
      rectangular selection removes all of the selected text.
    - Rectangular selections are copied to the clipboard in document
      order, not in the order of selection.
    - SCI_SETCURRENTPOS and SCI_SETANCHOR work in rectangular mode.
    - On GTK+, drag and drop to a later position in the document now
      drops at the position.
    - Fix bug where missing property did not use default value.
  - 2.0 changes
    - Multiple pieces of text can be selected simultaneously by holding
      control whil dragging the mouse. Typing, backspace and delete may
      affect all selections together.
    - Virtual space allows selecting beyond the last character on a line.
    - SciTE on GTK+ path bar is now optional and defaults to off.
    - MagikSF lexer recognises numbers correctly.

      indentation used a style with a different space width to the 
      default style.
    - SciTE bug fixed where box comment added a bare line feed rather 
      than the chosen line end. Bug #2818104.
    - Reverted fix that led to wrapping whole document when displaying 
      the first line of the document.
    - Export to LaTeX in SciTE fixed to work in more cases and not use 
      as much space. Bug #1286548.
    - Bug fixed where EN_CHANGE notification was sent when performing a 
      paste operation in a read-only document. Bug #2825485.
    - Refactored code so that Scintilla exposes less of its internal
      implementation and uses the C++ standard library for some basic
      collections. Projects that linked to Scintilla's SString or PropSet
      classes should copy this code from a previous version of Scintilla
      or from SciTE.
