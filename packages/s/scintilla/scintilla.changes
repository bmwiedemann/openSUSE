- Update to version 5.3.2:
  - Add SCI_REPLACETARGETMINIMAL to change text without causing
    unchanged prefix and suffix to be marked as modified in change
    history.
  - Draw background colour for EOL annotations with standard and
    boxed visuals.
  - Add SCI_GETSTYLEDTEXTFULL to support 64-bit document positions
    on Win32 replacing SCI_GETSTYLEDTEXT which is not safe for
    huge documents. Feature #1455.
  - Send SCN_AUTOCCOMPLETED for SCI_AUTOCSHOW triggering insertion
    because of SCI_AUTOCSETCHOOSESINGLE mode. Feature #1459.
  - Change 'paragraph up' commands SCI_PARAUP and SCI_PARAUPEXTEND
    to go to the start position of the paragraph containing the
    caret. Bug #2363.
  - Change release compilation optimization option to favour speed
    over space. -O2 for MSVC and -O3 for gcc and clang.
  - On Qt, implement SCI_SETRECTANGULARSELECTIONMODIFIER for all
    platforms.
  - On Qt, allow string form XPM images for SCI_REGISTERIMAGE. 
- Minor refreshing of scintilla-shared.patch to apply cleanly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 31 10:33:57 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to versoin 5.3.1:
  * Added SCI_STYLESETINVISIBLEREPRESENTATION to make it easier to
    edit around invisible text (Feature #1453).
  * Removed NotifyLexerChanged notification from DocWatcher. This
    is a private interface but could be used by independent
    platform layers and was exposed by ScintillaDocument in the Qt
    implementation of ScintillaEdit.
  * Draw lines more consistently in SC_PHASES_TWO and
    SC_PHASES_ONE modes by clipping drawing to just the line
    rectangle.
  * Draw SC_MARK_BAR markers underneath other markers as they
    often cover multiple lines for change history and other
    markers mark individual lines.
  * Enlarge point and point top indicators and scale to be larger
    with larger text.
  * Suppress change history background line shading when printing.
    Bug #2358.
  * Make SCI_LINESCROLL more accurate when width of space not
    integer (Bug #2357).
  * On GTK, fix bug where there were too many or too few lines
    when wrapping (Bug #2349). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 13:42:37 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

    (modified, saved, ...) in the margin or in the text.
  * Add SC_MARK_BAR marker and INDIC_POINT_TOP indicator.
  * Improve drawing of rounded rectangles on Direct2D.
  * Line state optimized to avoid excess allocations by always
    allocating for every line.
  * Add SC_FOLDACTION_CONTRACT_EVERY_LEVEL option to contract
    every level for SCI_FOLDALL [Bug #2340].
  * Enable multiline regex for gcc and clang when REGEX_MULTILINE
  * defined [Bug #2338].
  * Stop including STYLE_CALLTIP when calculating line height [Bug
    #2341].
  * Fix incorrect display of selection when printing in some modes
    [Bug #2335].

  * Improve performance of SCI_FOLDALL(SC_FOLDACTION_EXPAND) by
    not lexing whole document as it does not depend on folding
    structure.
  * Fix partial updates and non-responsive scroll bars on Xorg.
    This defers scroll bar changes to an idle task so could affect
    applications that depend on the scroll position being updated.
    Bug #2322, Bug #2196, Bug #2312.
  * Fix problem with horizontally inverted glyphs with buffered
    drawing and WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL set on Win32 GDI. Feature #1435.
  * For Qt 6, fix "modified" signal when text is null but length
    non-0. Bug #2328.

  * Made compatible with Qt 6.
  * Fix potential issue with length of buffer for string returning
    APIs in ScintillaEdit on Qt.
  * Fix inaccurate scroll bar when there are annotations and

    removed.

    SC_ORDER_CUSTOM or SC_ORDER_PERFORMSORT and the list is empty.
    Bug #2294.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 12:53:03 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.3:
  * Fix bug with SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED on Cocoa that led to
    incorrect layout with overlapping text.

  * Add SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED which can be used to optimize
    fonts that are monospaced over the ASCII graphics characters.
  * Add SC_ELEMENT_FOLD_LINE to set the colour of fold lines. Add
    SC_ELEMENT_HIDDEN_LINE to show where lines are hidden. Feature
    #1241, Feature #382, Feature #203.
  * Add SCI_SETCARETLINEHIGHLIGHTSUBLINE to highlight just the
    subline containing the caret instead of the whole document
    line. Feature #841.
  * Allow SCI_HIDELINES to hide the first line or all lines which
    can be useful for filtered views.
  * Make negative settings for extra ascent and descent safer by
    ensuring calculated ascent and thus line height is at least 1
    pixel.
  * Fix display of fold lines when wrapped so they are only drawn
    once per line, not on each subline.
  * Fix crash with too many subexpressions in regular expression
    search with SCFIND_CXX11REGEX. Bug #2281.
  * On GTK, fix the line spacing so that underscores and accents
    are visible for some fonts such as DejaVu Sans Mono 10.
  * On GTK, respond to changes in system font scaling by clearing
    any cached layout data. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 28 11:48:25 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.1:
  * In DBCS encodings, treat valid DBCS lead byte followed by
    invalid trail byte as single byte. Feature #1408.

    ASCII text and is often 2-3 times faster. Feature #1381.
  * Word searching behaves more consistently at start and end of
    document.
  * Add SCI_ALLOCATELINES to allocate indices to hold some number
    of lines. This can decrease reallocation overhead when the
    application can count or estimate the number of lines in huge
    files. Feature #1370.
  * Add SCI_AUTOCSETOPTIONS to allow choosing a non-resizeable
    autocompletion list on Win32. Feature #1284.
- Minor rebase of scintilla-shared.patch to apply cleanly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 27 02:25:36 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.0:
  * Add SciFnDirectStatus, a direct access function which also
    returns status. It can be retrieved with
    SCI_GETDIRECTSTATUSFUNCTION. This can avoid calling
    SCI_GETSTATUS after every API to determine failure so can
    improve performance.
  * Add more type-safe wrappers to the API. These are defined in
    include/ScintillaCall.h and implemented in
    call/ScintillaCall.cxx. ScintillaCall throws
    Scintilla::Failure exceptions when a call fails.
  * Add APIs for setting appearance (traditional blob or plain
    text) and colour of representations and support setting a
    representation for the "\r\n" line end sequence.
  * Add SCI_REPLACERECTANGULAR to insert text like a rectangular
    paste.
  * Fixed bug with SCI_GETLASTCHILD. Bug #2260.
  * Fixed gcc link-time-optimization (LTO) compilation. Bug #2259.

  * The Python folder treats comments at the end of the file as
    separate from the preceding structure.

    styles a "..." line like a "---" line. Bug #1931.
  * Update scroll bar when annotations added, removed, or
    visibility changed. Feature #1187.
  * Canceling modes with the Esc key preserves a rectangular
    selection. Bug #1940.
  * Builds are made with a sorted list of lexers to be more
    reproducible. Bug #1946.
  * SciTE examines at most 1 MB of a file to automatically
    determine indentation for indent.auto to avoid a lengthy pause
    when loading very large files.
  * SciTE user interface uses lighter colours and fewer 3D
    elements to match current desktop environments.
  * SciTE sets buffer dirty and shows message when file deleted if
    load.on.activate on.
  * SciTE on Windows Find strip Find button works in incremental
    no-close mode. Bug #1926.

    - Rectangular selections are copied to the clipboard in document
      order, not in the order of selection.

      classes should copy this code from a previous version of Scintilla
      or from SciTE.
