- Update to version 5.2.3:
  * Improve performance of SCI_FOLDALL(SC_FOLDACTION_EXPAND) by
    not lexing whole document as it does not depend on folding
    structure.

    This defers scroll bar changes to an idle task so could affect
    applications that depend on the scroll position being updated.
    Bug #2322, Bug #2196, Bug #2312.
  * Fix problem with horizontally inverted glyphs with buffered
    drawing and WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL set on Win32 GDI. Feature #1435.
  * For Qt 6, fix "modified" signal when text is null but length
    non-0. Bug #2328.
  * Fix pink selection background when printing by making it
    completely transparent.

    removed.

  * Fix bug with SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED on Cocoa that led to

  * Add SCI_STYLESETCHECKMONOSPACED which can be used to optimize
    fonts that are monospaced over the ASCII graphics characters.
  * Add SC_ELEMENT_FOLD_LINE to set the colour of fold lines. Add
    SC_ELEMENT_HIDDEN_LINE to show where lines are hidden. Feature
    #1241, Feature #382, Feature #203.
  * Add SCI_SETCARETLINEHIGHLIGHTSUBLINE to highlight just the
    subline containing the caret instead of the whole document
    line. Feature #841.
  * Allow SCI_HIDELINES to hide the first line or all lines which
    can be useful for filtered views.
  * Make negative settings for extra ascent and descent safer by
    ensuring calculated ascent and thus line height is at least 1
    pixel.
  * Fix display of fold lines when wrapped so they are only drawn
    once per line, not on each subline.
  * Fix crash with too many subexpressions in regular expression
    search with SCFIND_CXX11REGEX. Bug #2281.

- Update to version 5.1.1:
  * In DBCS encodings, treat valid DBCS lead byte followed by
    invalid trail byte as single byte. Feature #1408.

    ASCII text and is often 2-3 times faster. Feature #1381.
  * Word searching behaves more consistently at start and end of
    document.
  * Add SCI_ALLOCATELINES to allocate indices to hold some number
    of lines. This can decrease reallocation overhead when the
    application can count or estimate the number of lines in huge
    files. Feature #1370.
  * Add SCI_AUTOCSETOPTIONS to allow choosing a non-resizeable
    autocompletion list on Win32. Feature #1284.
- Minor rebase of scintilla-shared.patch to apply cleanly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 27 02:25:36 UTC 2021 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.0:
  * Add SciFnDirectStatus, a direct access function which also
    returns status. It can be retrieved with
    SCI_GETDIRECTSTATUSFUNCTION. This can avoid calling
    SCI_GETSTATUS after every API to determine failure so can
    improve performance.
  * Add more type-safe wrappers to the API. These are defined in
    include/ScintillaCall.h and implemented in
    call/ScintillaCall.cxx. ScintillaCall throws
    Scintilla::Failure exceptions when a call fails.
  * Add APIs for setting appearance (traditional blob or plain
    text) and colour of representations and support setting a
    representation for the "\r\n" line end sequence.
  * Add SCI_REPLACERECTANGULAR to insert text like a rectangular
    paste.
  * Fixed bug with SCI_GETLASTCHILD. Bug #2260.
  * Fixed gcc link-time-optimization (LTO) compilation. Bug #2259.

    highlighting the caret line.
  * Added "Reverse Selected Lines" feature.
  * SciTE adds "Select All Bookmarks" command.
  * SciTE adds a save.path.suggestion setting to suggest a file

  * Updated case conversion and character categories to Unicode 9.
  * The Baan lexer recognizes numeric literals in a more compliant
    manner including hexadecimal numbers and exponentials.

  * The Fortran lexer recognizes a preprocessor line after a line

  * The PowerShell lexer recognizes escaped quotes in strings. Bug
    #1929.
  * The Python lexer recognizes identifiers more accurately when
    they include non-ASCII characters.
  * The Python folder treats comments at the end of the file as
    separate from the preceding structure.
  * The YAML lexer recognizes comments in more situations and
    styles a "..." line like a "---" line. Bug #1931.
  * Update scroll bar when annotations added, removed, or
    visibility changed. Feature #1187.
  * Canceling modes with the Esc key preserves a rectangular
    selection. Bug #1940.
  * Builds are made with a sorted list of lexers to be more
    reproducible. Bug #1946.
  * SciTE examines at most 1 MB of a file to automatically
    determine indentation for indent.auto to avoid a lengthy pause
    when loading very large files.
  * SciTE user interface uses lighter colours and fewer 3D
    elements to match current desktop environments.
  * SciTE sets buffer dirty and shows message when file deleted if
    load.on.activate on.
  * SciTE on Windows Find strip Find button works in incremental
    no-close mode. Bug #1926.

- updated to version 2.01
  - 2.01 changes
    - Fix to positioning rectangular paste when viewing line ends.
    - Don't insert new lines and indentation for line ends at end of
      rectangular paste.
    - When not in additional selection typing mode, cutting a 
      rectangular selection removes all of the selected text.
    - Rectangular selections are copied to the clipboard in document
      order, not in the order of selection.
    - SCI_SETCURRENTPOS and SCI_SETANCHOR work in rectangular mode.
    - On GTK+, drag and drop to a later position in the document now
      drops at the position.
    - Fix bug where missing property did not use default value.
  - 2.0 changes
    - Multiple pieces of text can be selected simultaneously by holding
      control whil dragging the mouse. Typing, backspace and delete may
      affect all selections together.
    - Virtual space allows selecting beyond the last character on a line.
    - SciTE on GTK+ path bar is now optional and defaults to off.
    - MagikSF lexer recognises numbers correctly.

      indentation used a style with a different space width to the 
      default style.
    - SciTE bug fixed where box comment added a bare line feed rather 
      than the chosen line end. Bug #2818104.
    - Reverted fix that led to wrapping whole document when displaying 
      the first line of the document.
    - Export to LaTeX in SciTE fixed to work in more cases and not use 
      as much space. Bug #1286548.
    - Bug fixed where EN_CHANGE notification was sent when performing a 
      paste operation in a read-only document. Bug #2825485.
    - Refactored code so that Scintilla exposes less of its internal
      implementation and uses the C++ standard library for some basic
      collections. Projects that linked to Scintilla's SString or PropSet
      classes should copy this code from a previous version of Scintilla
      or from SciTE.
