  installing grub related files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 12 12:30:54 UTC 2022 - Kilian Hanich <khanich.opensource@gmx.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 25 12:44:24 UTC 2022 - Joey Lee <jlee@suse.com>

- Revoked the change in shim.spec for "use common SBAT values (boo#1193282)"
  - we need to build openSUSE Tumbleweed's shim on Leap 15.4 because Factory
    is unstable for building out a stable shim binary for signing. (bsc#1198458)
  - But the rpm-config-suse package in Leap 15.4 is direct copied from SLE 15.4
    because closing-the-leap-gap. So sbat_distro_* variables are SLE version,
    not for openSUSE. (bsc#1198458)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 28 04:03:45 UTC 2022 - Joey Lee <jlee@suse.com>
