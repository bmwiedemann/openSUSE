==== openSUSE ====
For openSUSE, the devel project of shim is devel:openSUSE:Factory. ALWAYS
use the latest Leap to build shim-opensuse.efi for UEFI CA. Tumbleweed
shares the same binary with Leap, so do the older Leap releases.

The steps to udpate signature-opensuse.asc:
1) Branch devel:openSUSE:Factory/shim.
2) Add the latest Leap, e.g. 42.2, to the build target.
3) Build shim-opensuse.efi against the latest Leap.
4) Strip the signature from shim-opensuse.efi with strip_signature.sh.
5) Send shim-opensuse.efi to UEFI CA to request a new signature.
6) Extract the signature from the signed shim.efi with extract_signature.sh
7) Update signature-opensuse.asc.

==== SLES ===
Since there is no devel project for shim in SLES, just build shim-sles.efi with
the latest SLES and then send it to UEFI CA for a new signature.

The steps to update signature-sles.asc:
1) Branch shim from the latest SLES and apply the update/fix.
2) Build shim-sles.efi against the latest SLES.
3) Strip the signature from shim-sles.efi with strip_signature.sh.
4) Send shim-sles.efi to UEFI CA to request a new signature.
5) Extract the signature from the signed shim.efi with extract_signature.sh
6) Update signature-sles.asc.
