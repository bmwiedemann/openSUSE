%description
Singular is a computer algebra system for polynomial computations,
with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra,
algebraic geometry, and singularity theory.

Its main computational objects are ideals, modules and matrices over
a large number of baserings. These include

* polynomial rings over various ground fields and some rings
  (including the integers),
* localizations of the above,
* a general class of non-commutative algebras (including the exterior
  algebra and the Weyl algebra),
* quotient rings of the above,
* tensor products of the above.

Singular's core algorithms handle

* Gr√∂bner resp. standard bases and free resolutions,
* polynomial factorization,
* resultants, characteristic sets, and numerical root finding.

%description -n libfactory-%verud
Factory is a C++ class library that implements a recursive
representation of multivariate polynomial data. Factory handles
sparse multivariate polynomials over different coefficient domains,
such as Z, Q and GF(q), as well as algebraic extensions over Q and
GF(q) in an efficient way. Factory includes algorithms for computing
univariate and multivariate gcds, resultants, chinese remainders, and
several algorithms to factorize univariate polynomials over the
integers and over finite fields.
