  <title>system and session manager</title>
  <description>systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd  provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. </description>
