.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSemantik\fP (previously Kdissert) is a mindmapping-like tool to help students
to produce complicated documents very quickly and efficiently :
presentations, dissertations, thesis, reports.

While targetted mostly at students, Semantik can also help teachers,
decision maker, engineers and businessmen.

Though this application shares some similarities with general-purpose
mindmapping tools like Freemind or Vym, the very first goal of Semantik is
to create general-purpose documents through the use of mindmaps.
