  <title>Image viewer for sway/wayland </title>
  <description>Swayimg is a lightweight image viewer for Wayland display servers.

In a Sway compatible mode, the viewer creates an &quot;overlay&quot; above the currently active window, which gives the illusion that you are opening the image directly in a terminal window.</description>
