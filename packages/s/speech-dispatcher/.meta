  <title>Device independent layer for speech synthesis</title>
  <description>The goal of Speech Dispatcher project is to provide a high-level device
independent layer for speech synthesis through a simple, stable and
well documented interface.

What is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
to speech synthesis. The application neither needs to talk to the
devices directly nor to handle concurrent access, sound output and other
tricky aspects of the speech subsystem.</description>
