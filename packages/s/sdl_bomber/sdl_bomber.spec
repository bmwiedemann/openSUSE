%description
This is a SDL Bomberman clone.

You've got to blow up other players to win. Spacebar drops a bomb. Get away
and hope your enemy gets hit by the flame. The 'b' key is a 2nd control
for when you are lucky enough to pick up the bomb control--looks like a
bomb with a timer on it. When you have that the bomb won't go off until
detonated by another bomb, you are killed, or you press 'b'.

Blowing up bricks might result in prizes, most of which are good.
Skates = speed up
Bomb = allow you to have one more active bomb
flame = Increase bomb strength
turtle = makes you move very slowly
bomb with timer = controlled bomb detonation with 'b' key.
gold flame = Set flame strength to max

There isn't much point in playing the game alone (single player). In that
case the only thing to avoid is accidentally killing yourself. Big deal...
It's really a multiplayer game.
