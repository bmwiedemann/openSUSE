Sat Sep  9 16:52:36 UTC 2023 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 3.0.0
  * Results from concurrent scans against multiple hosts are no
    longer improperly combined.
  * Hostname resolution failure no longer causes scans against
    multiple hosts to terminate unexpectedly.
  * Algorithm recommendations resulting from warnings are now
    printed in yellow instead of red.
  * Added failure, warning, and info notes to JSON output (note
    that this results in a breaking change to the banner protocol,
    "enc", and "mac" fields).
  * Fixed crash during GEX tests.
  * Refined GEX testing against OpenSSH servers: when the fallback
    mechanism is suspected of being triggered, perform an
    additional test to obtain more accurate results.
  * The color of all notes will be printed in green when the
    related algorithm is rated good.
  * Prioritized host key certificate algorithms for Ubuntu
    22.04 LTS client policy.
  * Marked all NIST K-, B-, and T-curves as unproven since they
    are so rarely used.

  * Added 12 new host keys
  * Added 15 new key exchanges.
  * Added 8 new ciphers.

  * SHA-1 algorithms now cause failures.
  * CBC mode ciphers are now warnings instead of failures.
  * Generic failure/warning messages replaced with more specific
