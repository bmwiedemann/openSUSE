  <title>Interactive console program which monitors squid logs access</title>
  <description>Squidview is an interactive console program which monitors 
and displays squid logs in a nice fashion, and may then go 
deeper with searching and reporting functions.

If you don't know what squid is or does this program is probably not for you.

To use squidview you must at least have read access to squid's 
access.log file. You may need to see your administrator for this.
Squidview uses this text log file for all operations. 
It does not generate its own database for tasks
