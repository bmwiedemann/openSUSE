  <title>List or change SCSI disk parameters</title>
  <description>SCSI disk parameters are held in mode pages. This utility lists or
changes those parameters. Other SCSI devices (or devices that use the
SCSI command set) such as CD/DVD and tape drives may also find parts of
sdparm useful. Requires the linux kernel 2.4 series or later. In the
2.6 series any device node the understands a SCSI command set may be
used (e.g. /dev/sda). In the 2.4 series SCSI device node may be used.

Warning: It is possible (but unlikely) to change SCSI disk settings
such that the disk stops operating or is slowed down. Use with care.</description>
