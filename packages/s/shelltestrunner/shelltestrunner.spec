%description
Shelltestrunner (executable: shelltest) is a portable command-line tool for
testing command-line programs, or general shell commands, released under
GPLv3+. It reads simple test specifications defining a command to run, some
input, and the expected output, stderr, and exit status. It can run tests in
parallel, selectively, with a timeout, in color, etc.
