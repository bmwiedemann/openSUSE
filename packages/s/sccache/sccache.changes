- Update to version 0.2.13~git474.6628e1f:
  * New entry in ServerStartup enum to indicate AddrInUse Error (#840)
  * Revert "Bump to tiny-http 0.7.0 (#830)" because it caused a regression, #846.
  * Include -fsanitizer-blacklist in common_args
  * Consume sanitizer blacklist as extra hash in msvc (#842)
  * In case we fail to read the compressed content from the cache, treat the failure as a forced
    recache. This prevents us from failing build jobs unconditionally if cache entries are corrupt
    (or in case of other sporadic failures), in which case we should continue on with
    force-recompiling and recaching. (#836)
  * Bump to tiny-http 0.7.0 (#830)
  * Modify logging to use SCCACHE_LOG. (#822)
  * Implement `g++` and `clang++` behavior when used on a `.c` input file. Fixes #803 (#818)
  * clang: Allow chrome plugin arguments (#817)
  * Add known caveats section to readme (#815)
