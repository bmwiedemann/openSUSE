  <title>Powerful Sound File Editor</title>
  <description>Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs and an old,
sorely-missed PDP-10 sound editor named Dpysnd. It can accommodate any
number of sounds each with any number of channels and can be customized
and extended using guile and guile-gtk.</description>
