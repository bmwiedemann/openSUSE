%description
Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN. Forwards over ssh.
Doesn't require admin. Supports DNS tunneling.
sshuttle is a program that solves the following case:
- You have access to a remote network via ssh.
- You don't necessarily have admin access on the remote network.
- The remote network has no VPN, or only complex VPN
  protocols (IPsec, PPTP, etc).
- You don't want to create an SSH port forward for every
  single host/port on the remote network.
- You can't use openssh's PermitTunnel feature because
  it's disabled by default on openssh servers; plus it does
  TCP-over-TCP, which has terrible performance.
