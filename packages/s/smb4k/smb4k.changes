Mon May 29 19:01:15 UTC 2017 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 2.0.1:
  * Fix a logic flaw in the mount helper (CVE-2017-8849).
  * Fix build system.
- Update to 2.0.0:
  * Ported Smb4K to Qt5 and KF5.
  * Removed the plasmoid from this release, because it has not been
    ported yet.
  * Added migration of config and XML files.
  * Bumped required CMake version to 3.3. Set policies for CMP0037
    and CMP0063 to NEW.
  * Implemented new org.kde.appname format for desktop and xml files.
  * Added support for high DPI screens.
  * Removed the IP scan job and setting, since that method did not
    to work properly.
  * Got rid of all dependencies to other shell programs except the
    Samba ones.
  * Revised the shares view:
    + The old list view was removed and replaced by a new one based
      on the default icon widget.
    + A new 'Shares View' action menu to was added to the shares
      view and the dynamic main tool bar.
    + The mount point is not shown anymore in the shares view.
    + Make sure no drops can be performed if either the computer is
      offline or the share is inaccessible.
  * Revised the mounter and the mount helper:
    + Rely on Solid to nofify the application that a share was
      added or removed.
    + Under Linux, the /proc/mounts file for imports is not needed
      anymore, because all the needed information is present in the
      KMountPoint::mountOptions() string list.
    + However, under FreeBSD/NetBSD a workaround for detecting
      mounts and unmounts had to be implemented for now, since on
      my FreeBSD system Solid was not able to detect mounts and
      unmounts of Samba shares.
  * Replaced the choice of the view mode of the shares view by a
    combo box in the configuration dialog.
  * Removed the setting for showing the mount point instead of the UNC.
  * Removed the protocol hint, since it is not needed anymore.
    Adjust the code accordingly. As a consequence, we are now
    using the RPC protocol when listing the shares of a server.
  * Removed obsolete configuration option that was used to
    determine an interval between checks for mounted shares.
  * The smbclient program of Samba 4.x does not report the server
    and operating system anymore. The support of this extra
    information has now been removed.
  * Suppress error messages and warnings when a browse/hosts/shares
    list could be retrieved.
  * Do not report those shares that were initially imported as
    being mounted.
  * Close all notifications on timeout.
  * Changed some status bar texts.
  * Fixed several issues in the preview dialog.
  * Improved hardware support.
  * Changed overlay for the icon of a foreign share.
  * Added a donator to the about dialog.
  * Remove "for KDE" in the description of SmbK as suggested by
    Burkhard Lück.
  * Updated handbook.
  * Removed CPack support.
  * And many other changes 
- Drop fix_plugin_path.diff, no longer necessary
- Drop remove-mounthelper.patch, the security flaws should be fixed
- Add smb4k-rpmlintrc to make it build until the mounthelper
  service is whitelisted

    by the security fixes released on April 12, 2016 to the handbook.
    Changed URL of the bug tracker to the KDE Bugtracking System.
    Bumped version number (and modification date) of the handbook.
  * Now that Smb4K is on bugs.kde.org, remove the custom bug report address.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 20:13:10 UTC 2015 - wbauer@tmo.at

- Update to 1.2.1:
  * Fixed the "authentication dialog is missing the host name" error
    (closes SF ticket #37).
  * Fixed scanning of broadcast areas (added missing pipe).
  * Updated license text to the current version of GPL v2
    (closes SF ticket #40).
  * Make Smb4K also useful with operating systems that are not supported.
    You can now do anything with it except mounting.
  * Fixed code under FreeBSD/NetBSD.
  * Split the mount options off the other options. Adjusted the code accordingly.
    The reason for this is that we want to support more operating systems
    and that is is now easier to deal with different mount options.
  * Use KIO::convertSize() instead self written code.
  * Refactored and improved code responsible for mounting.
  * Fix out-of-source builds when po is present. When building out-of-source,
    ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS never gets turned on because the po directory
    doesn't exist in the build directory, causing a build failure.
    This ensures that the correct source directory is always checked.

  * Implemented more CIFS mount options under Linux as well as a 
    whitelist of mount.cifs options that are save to be entered via the 
    "Additional options" line edit in the configuration dialog.
  * Remove setting for temporal storage of the login information. 
    Now, the user either stores the passwords in the wallet or needs to

  * With non-English languages the change introduced in version 1.0.8

    the shell output is truncated. Setting the language to "en_US.UTF-8"
    fixes this problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 08:56:54 UTC 2013 - wbauer@tmo.at

Sat Apr  4 17:28:48 CEST 2009 - coolo@suse.de

- refresh all patches to fix build

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 24 14:17:18 CEST 2008 - dmueller@suse.de

- update to 0.9.8:
  * Backported smb4k_sudowriter utility program. It directly writes to the /etc/sudoers file and thus finally fixes the messed-up-sudoers-file bug.
  * Removed smb4k_cat utility program. It's not needed anymore.
  * Removed smb4k_mv utility program. It's not needed anymore.
  * Removed the support for the program 'super'. If you used it before, you need to reconfigure Smb4K.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  3 14:31:31 CEST 2008 - stbinner@suse.de

- smb4k needs the .la to work, eg config dialog (bnc#374049)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 25 09:09:50 CET 2008 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.9.3 update:
   * Improves handling of login information. To achieve this, the
     format of the data that is written to the wallet had to be 
     changed and, thus, Smb4K 0.9.3 is not compatible with earlier
     versions. Conversion of the old data will be done automatically. 
   * Two small (un)mount issues and a regression in the network 
     browser have been also eliminated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 27 09:22:46 CET 2008 - stbinner@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 19 08:40:19 CET 2007 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.9 update:
  * Due to the new configuration system, the configuration you used
    for versions prior to 0.9.0 is obsolete. It will be removed on
    the first start-up of version 0.9.0 and you have to reconfigure.
  * Almost entirely rewritten GUI and many other changes under the
    hood such as the swtich to the KConfig XT configuration system,
    the use of the KParts technology and improved Konqueror plugin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 28 13:00:51 CET 2007 - stbinner@suse.de

    corrupted anymore.

  provoked smb4k_umount to complain about a deprecated argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 11:00:51 CEST 2007 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.8.2 update
  * Fixed a minor bug in the utility programs and applied some 
    cosmetic changes.
  * Worked around a bug that led to shares being remounted with
    UID=0 and GID=0 when using the CIFS file system.
  * Improved the 'Trouble Shooting' section of the handbook.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 10:41:15 CEST 2007 - wstephenson@suse.de

- 0.8.1 update
  * Rewrote smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, smb4k_kill, smb4k_cat, and smb4k_mv from scratch in order to fix several security weaknesses discovered by Ben Hutchings (should finally close #9631).
  * Adjusted Smb4KMounter class to the slightly changed behavior of the utility programs: The SIGTERM signal was removed from the command line of smb4k_kill in Smb4KMounter::abort() and the command lines for smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount commands were changed.
  * Started to address the browsing problems experienced by users in Active Directory environments: If the NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED error is encountered (which actually seems to be an authentication issue), Smb4K won't error out anymore but ask the user for the user name and password (closes #10280).
  * Fixed two bugs in Smb4KFileIO: The search for the lock file directory will not return a directory that is not readable and writeable and if the lock file does not exist when Smb4KFileIO::removeLockFile() wants to delete it, there will no error be shown anymore.
  * Fixed a compilation error under SUSE (10.2) und with the upcoming GCC 4.3.
  * Smb4K now uses the CIFS file system by default (closes #10804).
  * The handbook was updated to reflect the changes made to the utility programs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 22 13:59:07 CET 2007 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.8 update
  * security fixes following a security audit by Kees Cook
  * introduction of the ability to define custom options for shares
    or servers
  * drag-and-drop support in the shares view
  * improved Konqueror plugin and preview dialog, updated handbook
  * new IP scan lookup-method (which uses nmblookup to lookup all
    IP addresses known in a broadcast area)
  * smarter behavior of the browser
  * better handling of bookmarks (automatic updated of IP addresses)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 16:09:20 CET 2006 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.7.5 update
  * Fixed a serious bug in Smb4KFileIO that could cause a corrupted
    /etc/sudoers file if debug or error output was received via 
    stderr while reading the file for subsequent processing. 

- 0.7.4 update
  * Fixed a bug in Smb4KSearchDialog::slotCheckItemInBrowser()
    that occurred when a server item had no IP address displayed.
  * Fixed a bug in the shell code that was used to retrieve the
    list of workgroup/domain members from the master browser. 
  * Improved error handling in Smb4KScanner::processHosts().
  * Implemented better error handling in Smb4KSynchronizer:
    The synchronization is canceled if an error occurrs. This
    prevents the user from being flooded with error dialogs.
  * Fixed a bug that occurred when reading or writing the file
    and directory mask.
  * Changed the address used for reporting bugs via Help->Report Bugs.
  * Updated several translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 26 12:47:10 CEST 2006 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.7.3 update
  * Updated help texts, handbook, README and translations.
  * Fixed several issues in Smb4KFileIO: 
  * A host item will be collapsed if the authentication failed
  * Fixed insertion of a host from the search dialog to the browser
    window when the host has no IP address displayed.
  * Added missing error code to Smb4KGlobal::showCoreError().
  * Preview dialog won't accept contents of a wrong address anymore.
  * The wallet will be reopened if it was closed by the user, 
    the screensaver, etc.
  * The text streams are now aware of the locale.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  3 18:38:30 CEST 2006 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.7.2 update
  * Several crashes, memory leaks and other bugs fixed.
  * Updated several translations and handbook

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 19 09:01:53 CEST 2006 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.7.1 update
  * Fixed misc compilation errors
  * Updated translation and handbook
  * Introduced the possibility to modify the length of the interval
    between checks for external mounts/umounts and dead shares.
  * The timer will be disconnected from Smb4KScanner::start() if the
    scanner is idle. This drastically reduces the CPU load!
  * Fixed input validation when using smbclient for searching 
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the correct saving of updated
    authentication information.
  * Fixed smb4k.desktop file.
  * Removed two queries for a non-existent config entry.
  * Made the synchronization progress dialog work correctly with 
    the latest version of rsync.
  * Fixed a crash in the network browser's tooltip code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 11:46:51 CEST 2006 - adrian@suse.de

- fix build for < 10.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  2 14:42:57 CEST 2006 - stbinner@suse.de

- 0.7 update
  * KonqSidebar_Smb4K: hang up the new alreadyMountedShare signal
    from mounter. No error dialogs of "already been mounted share"
    anymore (partially closes #5636).
  * The old tab widget in the main window has been removed.
  * Added shortcuts to the main window that allow jumping to each
    dock widget: CTRL+1: Network Browser, CTRL+2/CTRL+S: Search
    Dialog, CTRL+3: Shares View.
  * Unified look of dialogs.
  * Did a major revision of the browser widget.
  * Did a major revision of the search dialog (closes #2247).
  * Did several changes to the shares view.
  * The bookmark editor allows editing of the IP address and 
    workgroup.
  * Put Smb4KShareWidgetItem class in own files.
  * Removed obsolete options "This master browser needs
    authentication" and "Use authentication when querying the
    workgroup master browsers" from the configuration dialog.
  * When closing the configuration dialog, the root password is 
    only asked, if the user changed one of the super user options
    (partially closes #5636).
  * The removal of the super user entries from super.tab and/or 
    sudoers is now determined by the choice in the configuration
    dialog.
  * Rewrote Smb4KSharesMenuWidget class.
  * Added new Smb4KShareActionMenu and Smb4KBrowserActionMenu
    classes. They contain the actions that were defined in
    Smb4KShareWidget and Smb4KBrowserWidget before, respectively. The
    use of Smb4KShareActionMenu in the system tray icon closes #5622.
  * Replaced deprecated KStdActions.
  * Introduced new Smb4KDataItem container for the core classes.
  * Revised bookmark handling (closes #6316).
  * The scanner class underwent a major revision (closes #4417).
  * Massively changed the entries and groups in the configuration
    file. As consequence, Smb4K will be incompatible with prior
    versions.
  * Added ability to synchronize a local copy with a remote share
    and vice versa (closes #1940). This feature uses Rsync. A few
    of the many options have been stripped, because they are used
    for transfer from remote hosts, which is no the case here.
  * Information of any share will now be collected by the mounter.
    Smb4KCore has been tidied up accordingly. Information of the
    number of files and directories has been dropped (for now).
  * Removed Catalan, Norwegian Nynorsk, Chinese Traditional (zh_TW)
    and Simplified (zh_CN), Russian and Polish translation because
    they were unmaintained and hopelessly out-dated.
  * Removed the Smb4KShellIO class, because its only purpose was to
    provide the Samba version. This is not necessary anymore, because 
    we switched to Samba 3.
  * Introduced smb4k_cat and smb4k_mv utilities to read and
    copy/move system config files.
  * The handbook shipping with this release actually contains useful
    information. However, it is still work in progress. The license
    of the handbook has been changed from GFDL to GPL.
  * If a user tries to mount an already mounted share, no error 
    message will be displayed anymore.
  * Renamed the global namespace to Smb4KGlobal and several
    functions inside.
  * Centralized the application's timer in the Smb4KGlobal
    namespace. As a side effect, this seems to fix the
    very-fast-vanishing-tooltips problem.
  * If the user canceled the writing to /etc/super.tab or
    /etc/sudoers, the previous state will be re-established.
  * Removed "Specify User" dialog from Smb4KBrowserWidget and moved
    it to Smb4KGlobal namespace. Now only core classes are using it.
  * Reworked and cleaned up Linux specific code in 
    Smb4KMounter::import().
  * Moved error handling to Smb4KGlobal namespace. The reason is,
    that the previous signal/slot model was not able to handle 
    errors during the initialization of the core.
  * Removed Smb4KPasswordHandler::AskPass class and integrated its
    functionality into Smb4KPasswordHandler::askpass(). This should
    fix the compilation errors encountered when using MIPSpro
    Compilers on IRIX/MIPS (closes #6811).
  * When reading the smb.conf file, a line beginning with a 
    semicolon is valued as comment.
  * Reduced CPU load by stretching the interval between checks for
    externally mounted and broken shares from 1000 ms to 2500 ms.
