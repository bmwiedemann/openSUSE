  <title>Singularity is a container platform focused on supporting &quot;Mobility of
Compute&quot;</title>
  <description>
    Mobility of Compute encapsulates the development to compute 
    model where developers can work in an environment of their choosing and 
    creation and when the developer needs additional compute resources, this 
    environment can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. 
    Additionally as the primary use case for Singularity is targeted towards 
    computational portability, many of the barriers to entry of other 
    container solutions do not apply to Singularity making it an ideal 
    solution for users (both computational and non-computational) and HPC 
    centers.
