  <title>SFCGAL C++ wrapper library around CGAL</title>
  <description>This library  support ISO 19107:2013, OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D operations.
It provides standard compliant geometry types and operations, that can 
be accessed from its C or C++ APIs. PostGIS uses the C API, to expose some 
SFCGAL's functions in spatial databases (cf. PostGIS manual).

Geometry coordinates have an exact rational number representation and can 
be either 2D or 3D. Among supported geometry types are :

 Points
 LineStrings
 Polygons
 TriangulatedSurfaces
 PolyhedralSurfaces
 GeometryCollections
 Solids

Supported operations include :

 WKT reading and writing with exact rational number representation for coordinates
 Intersection operations and predicates
 Convex hull computation
 Tessellation
 Extrusion
 Area and distance computation
 Minkovski sums
 Contour offsets
 Straight skeleton generations</description>
