  <title>Web Adminstration Interface to Subversion</title>
  <description> Submin provides a Web-based admin interface to your subversion repositories. Its features include user/group management, path permission management, and the ability to create svn repositories.

It uses htpasswd/svn authz for authentication, so it can use the same login information as apache2/svn (and trac).</description>
