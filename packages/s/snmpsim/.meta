  <title>SNMP Agents simulator</title>
  <description>SNMP Simulator is a software that would act like a multitude of real
physical devices from SNMP Manager's point of view. Simulator builds
and uses a database of physical devices' SNMP footprints to respond
like their real counterparts do.

Typical use case for this software starts with recording a snapshot
of SNMP objects of donor agents into text files. Once you have your
snapshots at hand, a simulator script could be run over the snapshots
responding to SNMP queries in the same way as donor SNMP agents did
at the time of recording.

Technically, SNMP Simulator is a multi-context SNMP agent. That means
that it handles multiple sets of managed object all at once.
Each device is simulated within a dedicated SNMP context.
