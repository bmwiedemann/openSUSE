- Update to version 3.40.1:
  + Fix build system issue which caused symbols from
    libsysprof-capture.a to leak into the ABI of libraries
    consuming it. This was due to inheritance of GNU default symbol
    visibility. A recompilation of those libraries is necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 28 22:56:23 UTC 2020 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.35.92:
  + A new profiler for tracking memory allocations within processes
    that are spawned by Sysprof. Select "Track Allocations" to use
    an LD_PRELOAD module which monitors allocations within the
    target process. A callgraph is provided with allocations and
    their stack traces. This brings the main features of the
    venerable "Memprof" into Sysprof.
  + Port Sysprof to work on RHEL 7.
  + Improvements to marks and counters displays.
  + A new data frame in libsysprof-capture for memory allocations
    with stack traces.

    and -Wl,-z,relro.
  + Fixes for macOS
  + The ELF symbol resolver is faster.
  + sysprof-cli now properly adds supplemental information to the
    capture file such as decoded symbols. This makes sharing syscap
    files across machines easier and more reliable.
  + A new mmap()'d ring buffer can be shared between processes for
    faster data transfer to sysprof. We expect more features around
    this SysprofCollector interface in future releases.
  + A new set if icons has been provided for the collectors
  + Updated translations.

- Update to version 3.33.90:
  + Tweak CSS styling a bit.
  + Hide RAPL rows if no counters were discovered.
  + Fix --no-battery in sysprof-cli.
  + Improve parsing of /proc/mounts and /proc/pid/mountinfo.
  + Improve support for using libsysprof from Flatpak.
  + Symbol directories are removed from public ABI and consumers
    should now add directories to SysprofElfSymbolResolver
    directly.
- Changes from version 3.33.4:
  + Build system fixes and improved backports.
  + New network, disk, battery, and energy sources.
  + Additional options for sysprof-cli including "syprof-cli
    --command" support.
  + i18n is now properly initialized at startup.
  + Improved styling.
  + A new "duplex" graph type for read/write type visuals.
- Changes from version 3.33.3:
  + This release of Sysprof contains the largest amount of work
    since we revived the project a few years ago. We have revamped
    and minimized the ABI of libsysprof-ui considerably. As port of
    the ABI update, symbols have been changed from Sp to Sysprof to
    reduce chances of collisions.
  + With these changes comes a soname bump and upgrade of the D-Bus
    API provided by the package. Some work has been taken to
    implement older versions of the sysprofd API so that older
    clients may continue to work.
  + Various build system improvements.
  + A new libsysprof-capture-3.a capture library has been provided
    to allow application developers to capture data and merge into
    the profiler stream.
  + The recording and viewing API has been redesigned and improved.
  + Sysprof has been backported to support GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50.
  + Support for passing file-descriptors has been added to allow
    profiling integration with GNOME Shell, GJS, and GTK profilers.
  + New API to allow integration with external tooling that spawns
    applications is provided so that environment and arguments may
    be modified.
  + A new re-record feature has been added.
  + The capture format can now store log messages, metadata, and
    file content.
  + A new org.gnome.Sysprof3 daemon has been added, which is
    written using GDBus instead of libsystemd. This may improve
    portability to some distributions.
  + The portability of Sysprof to non-Linux systems has been
    improved, however many recording features are still not
    available on non-Linux platforms.
  + A new org.gnome.Sysprof3.Profiler XML D-Bus interface is
    provided for tooling that wants to export Sysprof content via
    D-Bus.
  + Various new capture sources have been provided.
  + sysprofd also implements a compat org.gnome.Sysprof2 D-Bus
    end-point for older clients.
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(glib-2.0) and pkgconfig(libdazzle-1.0)
  BuildRequires: New dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 08:23:32 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 07:46:35 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Replace systemd-gtk BuildRequires with pkgconfig(systemd): make
  the build cheaper by not having to wait for the 'real' systemd
  package to have built, but allow to use systemd-mini. The change
  in the stack causing this was polkit dropping its hard dep on
  systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 11 20:12:28 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add systemd-gtk BuildRequires: Now needed due to changes

  + Updated translations.
- Drop sysprof-fix-incorrect-free-func.patch (fixed upstream).
- Remove lang package from recommended packages as it already
  supplements main package (same effect, it's redundant).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 00:42:44 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.29.3:
  + Experimental tracking of various drm events (vblank and
    CRTC/MSC).
  + Drawing code now uses double instead of float for additional
    precision.
  + CLOCK_MONOTONIC is now the preferred clock.
  + A new capture type of "mark" has been added to the capture
    format. It supports an event name with a duration >= 0.
  + Various counters are automatically detected and displayed when
    opening a capture file.
  + A new in-tree tool "sysprof-cat" which can join multiple
    capture files together gracefully.
  + Fix a number of situations where cpu/pid were crossed.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop explicit gettext BuildRequires: meson doesn't look for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 03:58:02 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.28.1:
  + Updated translations.
- Add hicolor-icon-theme BuildRequires for directory ownership
  purposes.
- Drop:
  + binutils-devel, gobject-introspection-devel and libxml2-tools
    BuildRequires packages: they are no longer required nor used
    anymore.
  + desktop_database_* and icon_theme_cache_* post/postun
    scriptlets: their functionality has been moved to RPM file
    triggers (version 4.13, suse_version 1330).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 14 10:54:30 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Sysprof now exclusively uses the meson build system.
  + Improvements to the process filtering model used in the
    profiler popover.
  + More tests for utility helpers.
  + Some code was relicensed to LGPLv2.1+ to extend it's
    reusability.
  + A new libsysprof-capture-2.a static library is installed to
    allow external tooling to read and write the capture format.
    We expect tooling such as GJS to use this in the future.
  + A new kallsyms tokenizer was added.
  + If we fail to parse kallsyms as the effective user, we now
    query the sysprofd daemon to access and parse those symbols for
    us as root. This requires polkit authorization on the DBus
    connection just like our elevated perf_event_open() helper.
  + Now that we have to deal with overlapping kernel and user-space
    memory, Sysprof tries harder to check the current perf context.
    New API was added to symbol resolvers to facilitate this.
- Split out new subpackage sysprof-capture-devel-static.
- Use meson build system, following upstreams change:
  + Add meson BuildRequires.
  + Use meson/meson_build/meson_install instead of
    configure/make/make_install.
- Add sysprof-drop-debug-code.patch: Fix build on i586 by removing
  lingering debug code.

  + Various compilation checks based on results from ARM builders.
  + Support for setting symbol directories to affect symbol
    resolution.
  + Translate paths from /newroot/ into the host filesystem when
    possible. This should allow some degree of profiling
    container-based applications and still resolve symbols on the
    host. Builder does this now when profiling Flatpak-based
    applications.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 18 17:53:31 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Handle EAGAIN when writing the opportunistic end-time header.
  + Capture cursor should short circuit when no read delegate was
    found.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 11:27:09 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.22.1:
  + A new data source called "hostinfo" has been added. It records
    various CPU datapoints as "counters" in the sysprof capture.
  + A new visualizers abstraction has been added so that we can
    start providing new ways to look at profiler data.
  + A CPU visualizer has been added which renders datapoints
    recorded from the hostinfo data source.
  + Selecting ranges of the visualizer will update the callgraph
    limiting stacktrace samples, to the given time range.
  + Missing headers are now installed which may be needed by
    applications using libsysprof-ui.
  + A keyboard shortcuts dialog has been added.
  + A theme manager has been added to allow us to provide custom
    CSS for various themes. Currently, we have additional styling
    added for Adwaita and Adwaita-dark.
  + Updated translations.
- Pass --disable-Werror to configure, we do not need to handle
  warnings as errors.
