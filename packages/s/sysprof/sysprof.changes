- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 13 07:46:35 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Replace systemd-gtk BuildRequires with pkgconfig(systemd): make
  the build cheaper by not having to wait for the 'real' systemd
  package to have built, but allow to use systemd-mini. The change
  in the stack causing this was polkit dropping its hard dep on
  systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 11 20:12:28 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add systemd-gtk BuildRequires: Now needed due to changes
  elsewhere in the stack.

- Remove lang package from recommended packages as it already
  supplements main package (same effect, it's redundant).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 00:42:44 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

- Update to version 3.29.3:
  + Experimental tracking of various drm events (vblank and
    CRTC/MSC).
  + Drawing code now uses double instead of float for additional
    precision.
  + CLOCK_MONOTONIC is now the preferred clock.

    format. It supports an event name with a duration >= 0.

  + A new in-tree tool "sysprof-cat" which can join multiple
    capture files together gracefully.
  + Fix a number of situations where cpu/pid were crossed.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop explicit gettext BuildRequires: meson doesn't look for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 16:50:12 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.91:
  + Sysprof now exclusively uses the meson build system.
  + Improvements to the process filtering model used in the
    profiler popover.
  + More tests for utility helpers.
  + Some code was relicensed to LGPLv2.1+ to extend it's
    reusability.
  + A new libsysprof-capture-2.a static library is installed to
    allow external tooling to read and write the capture format.
    We expect tooling such as GJS to use this in the future.
  + A new kallsyms tokenizer was added.
  + If we fail to parse kallsyms as the effective user, we now
    query the sysprofd daemon to access and parse those symbols for
    us as root. This requires polkit authorization on the DBus
    connection just like our elevated perf_event_open() helper.
  + Now that we have to deal with overlapping kernel and user-space
    memory, Sysprof tries harder to check the current perf context.
    New API was added to symbol resolvers to facilitate this.
- Split out new subpackage sysprof-capture-devel-static.
- Use meson build system, following upstreams change:
  + Add meson BuildRequires.
  + Use meson/meson_build/meson_install instead of
    configure/make/make_install.
- Add sysprof-drop-debug-code.patch: Fix build on i586 by removing
  lingering debug code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Various compilation checks based on results from ARM builders.
  + Support for setting symbol directories to affect symbol
    resolution.
  + Translate paths from /newroot/ into the host filesystem when
    possible. This should allow some degree of profiling
    container-based applications and still resolve symbols on the
    host. Builder does this now when profiling Flatpak-based
    applications.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 18 17:53:31 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

    previous capture file. This ensures we don't leave junk at the
    end of the capture.
  + Handle EAGAIN when writing the opportunistic end-time header.
  + Capture cursor should short circuit when no read delegate was
    found.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 11:27:09 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.22.1:
  + A new data source called "hostinfo" has been added. It records
    various CPU datapoints as "counters" in the sysprof capture.
  + A new visualizers abstraction has been added so that we can
    start providing new ways to look at profiler data.
  + A CPU visualizer has been added which renders datapoints
    recorded from the hostinfo data source.
  + Selecting ranges of the visualizer will update the callgraph
    limiting stacktrace samples, to the given time range.
  + Missing headers are now installed which may be needed by
    applications using libsysprof-ui.
  + A keyboard shortcuts dialog has been added.
  + A theme manager has been added to allow us to provide custom
    CSS for various themes. Currently, we have additional styling
    added for Adwaita and Adwaita-dark.
  + Updated translations.
- Pass --disable-Werror to configure, we do not need to handle
  warnings as errors.
