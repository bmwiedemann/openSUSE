-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  2 21:10:19 UTC 2023 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 45.rc:
  + A Rust demangler is provided which can demangle some newer
    style Rust symbols.
  + The C++ and Rust legacy demanger has improved to handle some
    scenarios where <> and :: should be used.
  + The D-Bus section has gained support for search filtering.
  + A busy indicator is now show when callgraphs are being
    generated or updated to reflect changing view options.
  + Improvements to sysprof-cli and sysprof-agent to support recent
    capture features.
  + sysprof-cli can now specify capture buffer size in number of
    pages to help in situations where you want to avoid disk
    spillage.
  + Zoom controls now stay sticky to the left.
  + SysprofCollector will now try much harder for the peer to
    process the mmap ring buffer before bailing so that the leak
    collector is less likely to drop records.
  + Sysprof now uses gtktimsort to sort records for a significant
    speed improvement when loading large captures.
  + Window titles now include document title.
  + Reduction in number of samples to normalize for various charts
    which results in faster loading times. You can continue to zoom
    in to get better details.
  + A new scheduler details instrument is provided, which uses
    tracepoints to track when processes were running and on what
    CPU.
  + A new flamegraph is added for viewing profiling results. It is
    powered by the same callgraph seen in the callgraph view, which
    means changes to the callgraph can influence the flamegraph.
    Colorization is provided by stack categorization in callgraphs.
  + Categorization of Kernel symbols has been fixed.
  + Callgraphs are now sorted incrementally to help keep the UI
    responsive while loading the document.
  + Accounting of weights for callgraphs has been improved to avoid
    double counting summary values when recursion is used.
  + A fix for a crash when pivoting to a new root in the callgraph.
  + A new option to merge similar processes when generating
    callgraphs.
  + A new option to filter out kernel processes has been added.
    This feature is quite rudimentary and involves commandline
    sniffing. Improvements are requested by those seeking more
    comprehensive filtering.
  + Improvements to locating and symbolizing Flatpak processes.
  + The files section has gained search filter support.

- Changes from version 45.beta:
  + Sysprof has largely been redesigned and rewriten from the
    ground up this cycle to provide better GTK 4 integration and
    more advanced features.
  + libsysprof-capture: This library is our static library used by
    many applications and libraries to augment capture collection.
    It is still installed as libsysprof-capture-4.a as a static
    library for consumers. The ABI is the same, however some new
    data types have been added.
  + libsysprof:
    - This library has been rewritten around a new document model
      for captures, which has allowed for many new indexing
      performance improvements as well as simpler data-binding in
      the user interface.
    - Additionally, a new SysprofProfiler API has been added. It
      has been much simplified and allows for easier implementation
      of instruments in a race free manner.
    - The library heavily builds upon libdex for Futures which I
      created this past window to simplify features in GNOME
      Builder.
  + sysprof-cli and sysprof-agent: These tools both provide similar
    features albeit from a different standpoint. They have both
    been updated to use the new profiler interface in libsysprof.
  + sysprofd: Very minimal changes have been made to sysprofd to
    help ensure that the application and libraries can still work
    on systems with an older sysprofd installed on the host.
  + Sysprof: The application has been completely redesigned and is
    now window focused rather than tabs. The constraint of tabs was
    becoming too cumbersome to maintain.

- Add libdex-1 and libpanel-1 pkgconfig() BuildRequires, as new
  introduced dependencies.
- Add fdupes BuildRequires and call its macro on %install directive
  against the datadir.
- Split out the sysprof shared library as libsysprof-6-6 now that
  it's being versioned (6.0.0).
- Drop deprecated sysprof-ui libraries and their development files;
  and add sysprof-ui < 3.49 Obsoletes tag.
- Drop multibuild facilities now. It is not worth it anymore with
  the recent changes brought by this release.
- Drop harden_sysprof2.service.patch. The file it patches
  (sysprof2.service) no longer exists.
- Drop no longer needed auto dependencies.
- Merge sysprof-capture-devel-static into devel sub-package due to
  compilation issues with other packages that require both
  sysprof-4 and sysprof-capture-4 pkgconfig modules. Those packages
  expect to have header files from both sysprof-4 and
  sysprof-capture-4 libraries (all header files were being packaged
  into sysprof-devel packages, even sysprof-capture*.h ones), but
  we can split them -- between sysprof-devel and
  sysprof-capture-static devel -- because build scripts from
  packages that only require sysprof-capture-4 libraries expect to
  find sysprof-4 headers too, without requiring sysprof-4.
- Add sysprof-capture-devel-static < 3.49 Obsoletes tag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + A new profiler for tracking memory allocations within processes
    that are spawned by Sysprof. Select "Track Allocations" to use
    an LD_PRELOAD module which monitors allocations within the
    target process. A callgraph is provided with allocations and
    their stack traces. This brings the main features of the
    venerable "Memprof" into Sysprof.

  + sysprof-cli now properly adds supplemental information to the
    capture file such as decoded symbols. This makes sharing syscap
    files across machines easier and more reliable.

    faster data transfer to sysprof. We expect more features around
    this SysprofCollector interface in future releases.
  + A new set if icons has been provided for the collectors
  + Updated translations.

    directly.
- Changes from version 3.33.4:
  + Build system fixes and improved backports.
  + New network, disk, battery, and energy sources.
  + Additional options for sysprof-cli including "syprof-cli
    --command" support.
  + i18n is now properly initialized at startup.
  + Improved styling.
  + A new "duplex" graph type for read/write type visuals.
- Changes from version 3.33.3:
  + This release of Sysprof contains the largest amount of work
    since we revived the project a few years ago. We have revamped
    and minimized the ABI of libsysprof-ui considerably. As port of
    the ABI update, symbols have been changed from Sp to Sysprof to
    reduce chances of collisions.
  + With these changes comes a soname bump and upgrade of the D-Bus
    API provided by the package. Some work has been taken to
    implement older versions of the sysprofd API so that older
    clients may continue to work.
  + Various build system improvements.
  + A new libsysprof-capture-3.a capture library has been provided
    to allow application developers to capture data and merge into
    the profiler stream.
  + The recording and viewing API has been redesigned and improved.
  + Sysprof has been backported to support GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50.
  + Support for passing file-descriptors has been added to allow
    profiling integration with GNOME Shell, GJS, and GTK profilers.
  + New API to allow integration with external tooling that spawns
    applications is provided so that environment and arguments may
    be modified.
  + A new re-record feature has been added.
  + The capture format can now store log messages, metadata, and
    file content.
  + A new org.gnome.Sysprof3 daemon has been added, which is
    written using GDBus instead of libsystemd. This may improve
    portability to some distributions.
  + The portability of Sysprof to non-Linux systems has been
    improved, however many recording features are still not
    available on non-Linux platforms.
  + A new org.gnome.Sysprof3.Profiler XML D-Bus interface is
    provided for tooling that wants to export Sysprof content via
    D-Bus.
  + Various new capture sources have been provided.
  + sysprofd also implements a compat org.gnome.Sysprof2 D-Bus
    end-point for older clients.
  + Updated translations.

  supplements main package (same effect, it's redundant).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 00:42:44 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

  + A new in-tree tool "sysprof-cat" which can join multiple
    capture files together gracefully.
  + Fix a number of situations where cpu/pid were crossed.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop explicit gettext BuildRequires: meson doesn't look for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 03:58:02 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 16:50:12 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.27.91:
  + Sysprof now exclusively uses the meson build system.
  + Improvements to the process filtering model used in the
    profiler popover.
  + More tests for utility helpers.
  + Some code was relicensed to LGPLv2.1+ to extend it's
    reusability.
  + A new libsysprof-capture-2.a static library is installed to
    allow external tooling to read and write the capture format.
    We expect tooling such as GJS to use this in the future.
  + A new kallsyms tokenizer was added.
  + If we fail to parse kallsyms as the effective user, we now
    query the sysprofd daemon to access and parse those symbols for
    us as root. This requires polkit authorization on the DBus
    connection just like our elevated perf_event_open() helper.
  + Now that we have to deal with overlapping kernel and user-space
    memory, Sysprof tries harder to check the current perf context.
    New API was added to symbol resolvers to facilitate this.
- Split out new subpackage sysprof-capture-devel-static.
- Use meson build system, following upstreams change:
  + Add meson BuildRequires.
  + Use meson/meson_build/meson_install instead of
    configure/make/make_install.
- Add sysprof-drop-debug-code.patch: Fix build on i586 by removing
  lingering debug code.

  + Various compilation checks based on results from ARM builders.
  + Support for setting symbol directories to affect symbol
    resolution.
  + Translate paths from /newroot/ into the host filesystem when
    possible. This should allow some degree of profiling
    container-based applications and still resolve symbols on the
    host. Builder does this now when profiling Flatpak-based
    applications.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb 18 17:53:31 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Capture cursor should short circuit when no read delegate was
    found.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 11:27:09 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.22.1:
  + A new data source called "hostinfo" has been added. It records
    various CPU datapoints as "counters" in the sysprof capture.
  + A new visualizers abstraction has been added so that we can
    start providing new ways to look at profiler data.
  + A CPU visualizer has been added which renders datapoints
    recorded from the hostinfo data source.
  + Selecting ranges of the visualizer will update the callgraph
    limiting stacktrace samples, to the given time range.
  + Missing headers are now installed which may be needed by
    applications using libsysprof-ui.
  + A keyboard shortcuts dialog has been added.
  + A theme manager has been added to allow us to provide custom
    CSS for various themes. Currently, we have additional styling
    added for Adwaita and Adwaita-dark.
  + Updated translations.
- Pass --disable-Werror to configure, we do not need to handle
  warnings as errors.
