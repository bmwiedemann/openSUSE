  <title>The SHP Hypertext Preprocessor</title>
  <description>Like PHP, except you write your script in the bash shell scripting language instead of PHP.

SHP parses and executes SHP scripts in the manner of PHP, except nested
scripts are written in shell scripting language instead of the PHP lan-
guage. SHP outputs its script file, with nested &lt;?shp ... ?&gt; blocks exe-
cuted as shell scripts.
