  <title>Low-Level Event Loop Management Library</title>
  <description>Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based
operating systems. It supports the development of modular, multiplexed
applications that may respond to events from several sources. It
replaces the &quot;select() loop&quot; and allows the registration of event
handlers for file and network I/O, timers, and signals. Because
processes use these mechanisms for almost all external communication,
liboop can be used as the basis for almost any application.</description>
