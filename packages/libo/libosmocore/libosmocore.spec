%description
libosmocore is a package with various utility functions that were
originally developed as part of the OpenBSC project, but which are of
a more generic nature and thus useful to (at least) other programs
that Osmocom develops w.r.t. mobile communications.

There is no clear scope of it. It simply houses all code shared
between OsmocomBB and OpenBSC to avoid code duplication.
