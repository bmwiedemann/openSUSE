Sat Aug 30 22:01:42 UTC 2025 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- Remove patches, as they've been merged upstream:
  * liborcus-0.19.2-gcc15-cstdint.patch
- Fix source tarball URL.
- Upgrade to 0.20.2.
- Changes from 0.20.2:
  * The base JSON parser class (orcus::json_parser) now allows primitive string,
    numeric and boolean values to be document root as it should per JSON
    specification.
  * added to the command-line programs proper support for Unicode filepath
    handling on Windows which still uses UTF-16 with code pages.  Relevant
    public API has been updated to add support for Unicode filepaths on Windows.
  * added to the import_sheet interface a variant of set_string() that takes a
    non-indexed string value.  This is used to handle cells with inline strings
    in the xlsx import filter.  However, orcus's own document store backend does
    not yet handle cells with non-indexed strings, so when importing xlsx
    documents containing cells with inline strings, those cells will be ignored
    for now.
  * added to the orcus::format_t enum type json and xml as its members.  With
    that change, you can now instantiate import filter adapters for these two
    new format types to import generic JSON and XML documents.  These two
    adapter filters will auto-detect tabular structures and map them to sheets
    if they exist.
  * orcus::detect() can now detect generic JSON and XML documents.
  * fixed a bug where orcus-xml generated incorrect map file in map-gen mode
    when the source document contained multiple tabular structures.
- Changes from 0.20.1:
  * fixed an assertion failure when importing a document in Excel 2003 XML
    format containing an autofilter with no filtering applied to it.
  * added a set of new interfaces to support importing pivot table definitions
    from xlsx documents.
  * added support for dumping the internal state of pivot caches and pivot table
    definitions as part of the debug state output.
  * added clarification on the return value of import_sheet::get_sheet_size()
    interface method in the documentation.
  * C++ API reference has been restructured to show each symbol in a separate
    page, and have their header information also included.
  * added test cases for testing expected string labels for enum types.
  * fixed orcus-json's map mode which would previously fail when built with
    CMake.
- Changes from 0.20.0:
  * import filters
    * added support for more format types in formatted strings in xlsx, xls-xml
      and gnumeric filters.  The following format types are now supported:
      * superscript
      * subscript
      * strikethrough
      * underline
    * strikethrough format applied to cells are now supported in xlsx and
      xls-xml.
    * importing of underline format applied to cells in gnumeric have been
      revised to fix issues.
    * interface for autofilter import has been revamped to properly import
      autofilter properties from xlsx, xls-xml, gnumeric and ods.
    * import_sheet_properties::set_row_height() now takes a row span as opposed
      to a single row position.
    * fixed a bug in the ods filter to properly separate styles in different
      style families.  Previously, all styles were stored without style-family
      segregation which resulted in collision of styles with the same name.
  * document model
    * format run storage in orcus::spreadsheet::format_run now correctly
      differentiates a format not being applied from a negative format being
      applied.  For instance, the previous storage could not differentiate the
      state of a bold format not being specified from a non-bold state being
      intentionally applied.
  * json
    * added support for custom indent when formatting JSON document.
      orcus::json::document_tree::dump() now takes an additional indent
      parameter to control the amount of indentation in the output.
    * orcus::json::subtree class has been added to allow referencing of subtree
      in an existing document_tree instance.
    * parser has been revised to properly handle escaped unicode characters.
      The parser now propertly converts escaped unicode characters to proper
      UTF-8 characters.
  * tools
    * orcus-json now has a new subtree mode to allow extraction of subtree from
      an existing JSON document.  The root of a subtree is to be specified as a
      subset of JSONPath expression.  Both bracket notation and dot notation are
      supported.  Wildcard selector is also supported.
    * orcus-json now has a lint mode to allow reformatting of a JSON document
      with custom indent length via --indent option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 10 20:00:36 UTC 2025 - Friedrich Haubensak <hsk17@mail.de>

- add liborcus-0.19.2-gcc15-cstdint.patch to fix gcc15 compile time
  error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  6 15:42:21 UTC 2024 - Martin Jambor <mjambor@suse.com>

- On 32bit x86 architectures, compile with option -ffloat-store.  This
  mitigates the unfortunate fact that the test-suite of the package
  expects the precision of FP operations to be lower than that of
  internal representation of 80387.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 29 18:42:34 UTC 2024 - pgajdos@suse.com

- Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated
  %patchN

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 16:36:32 UTC 2024 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to orcus 0.19.2:
  * fixed a build issue with gcc 14 due to a missing include for std::find_if
    and std::for_each.
  * fixed a segmentation fault with the orcus-test-xml-mapped test which
    manifested on hppa hardware, as originally reported on
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1054376.
  * fixed a crash when loading a document that includes a style record
    referencing an unnamed style record as its parent.  In Excel-generated
    documents, styles only reference named styles as their parents.  But in
    3rd-party generated documents, styles referencing unnamed styles as their
    parents can occur.
  * fixed a crash when the document model returned a null pointer when a
    reference resolver interface was requested.
- Update to orcus 0.19.1:
  * implemented orcus::create_filter() which instantiates a filter object of
    specified type.  The returned object is of type
    orcus::iface::import_filter.
  * moved test cases for format detection to the respective filter test files.
  * fixed a bug where the import filter did not set the formula grammer prior
    to importing.
- Update to orcus 0.19.0:
  * added support for allowing use of std::filesystem,
    std::experimental::filesystem or boost::filesystem per build
    configuration.
  * refactored styles import to use style indices returned by the document
    model implementer rather than using the indices stored in the file.  This
    allows the implementer to aggregate some style records and re-use the same
    index for records that are stored as different records in the original
    file.
  * fixed a bug where column styles were not applied to the correct columns
    when the starting column index was not 0.
  * overhauled the Gnumeric import filter to fix many bugs and support many
    missing features relative to the other filters included in orcus.  Most
    notable mentions are:
    * cell styles
    * rich-text strings
    * named ranges
    * row heights and column widths
    * merged cells
  * added partial support for Apache Parquet import filter.  This is still
    heavily experimental.
- Remove patches:

    + split into chunks per topic so that upsteam can decide what
      to do

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 16:06:48 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Clean up the spec file and require gcc-c++ >= 7, since that is the
  first version that supports C++17
- Run tests on all distributions and architectures
  * Allow disabling them on command line by specifying
    "--without tests"
- Changed patch:
  * no-std-filesystem.patch -> liborcus-filesystem.patch
    + rework the patch to detect std::filesystem,
      std::experimental::filesystem and boost::filesystem (in that
      order, and use them if found)
- Added patch:
  * liborcus-tests.patch
    + fix tests on all platforms
    + do not use C++20 features with the
      boost::filesystem::directory_iterator
    + do not assume that pathlib integrates seamlessly with open
      and do not use f-string formating, both being python 3.6+
      features

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 29 09:12:39 UTC 2023 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.1:
  * sax parser:
    * added support for optionally skipping multiple BOM's in the beginning of
      XML stream.  This affects all XML-based file format filters such as
      xls-xml (aka Excel 2003 XML).
  * xml-map:
    * fixed a bug where an XML document consisting of simple single-column
      records were not properly converted to sheet data.
  * xls-xml:
    * fixed a bug where the filter would always pass border color even when it
      was not set.
  * buildsystem:
    * added new configure switches --without-benchmark and --without-doc-example
      to optinally skip building of these two directories.
- Remove patch gcc13-fix.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 13:57:17 UTC 2023 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 27 14:34:01 UTC 2022 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Added patch:
  * no-std-filesystem.patch
    + use boost::filesystem instead of std::filesystem, in order to
      allow building with older compilers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 26 14:47:32 UTC 2022 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.2:
  * fixed a bug where the state of style:cell-protect="none" was not
    explicitly pushed, thereby having had the same effect as not having this
    attribute.  After the fix, style:cell-protect="none" will explicitly push
    the hidden state to false, locked state to false, and the formula-hidden
    state to false.
- Update to 0.17.1:
  * addressed a number of coverity issues.
  * removed a variety of compiler warnings.
  * re-generated sax parser tokens from ODF v1.3.
  * revised the style import code to only push style attributes that are
    actually specified in the XML.
  * revised the XML structure validation strategy to ignore any mis-placed
    elements and their sub structures rather than aborting the import.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 19 10:34:49 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.0:
  * set the baseline C++ version to 17.
  * cleaned up the public API to replace pstring with std::string_view, union
    with std::variant, and boost::optional with std::optional.  With this
    change, the public API no longer has dependency on boost.
  * switched to using ixion::model_iterator for horizontal iteration of cells
    instead of using mdds::mtv::collection.
  * fixed a bug where exporting a spreadsheet document containing adjacent
    merged cells regions to html incorrectly exported the merged cell areas.
  * cached cell values are now correctly loaded from the xlsx file.
  * utf-8 names are now allowed as element and attribute names in the sax parser.
  * unquoted utf-8 property values are now allowed in the css parser.
  * added yaml output option in orcus-json.
  * fixed a bug where mapping of an XML document with namespace aliases
    sometimes corrupts the alias values.
  * added orcus.FormulaTokenOp enum type in python which describes type formula token
    operator types in a more finer grained manner.
  * added notes to how to use orcus-xml and orcus-json to map XML and JSON
    documents to spreadsheet documents.
