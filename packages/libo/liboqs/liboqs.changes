Thu Apr 17 16:03:16 UTC 2025 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Updated to 0.13.0:
  - Key encapsulation mechanisms                                                                                                                                                             
    - New API: Added a deterministic key generation and API for KEMs (only ML-KEM supported at the moment).
    - ML-KEM: Changed the default ML-KEM implementation to [PQCP's mlkem-native](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native). There are three variants: Portable C, AVX2, and AArch64. Large +parts of these implementations are formally verified: all of the C code is verified for memory and type safety using [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and the functional correctness +of the core AArch64 assembly routines is verified using [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light).
    - ML-KEM: Added support for the ML-KEM implementation from [Nvidia cuPQC](https://developer.nvidia.com/cupqc), a GPU accelerated cryptography library.
    - ML-KEM: Implementation from mlkem-native upstream updated to add Pair-wise Consistency Test (PCT) and Intel CET support.
    - ML-KEM: Improved testing of ML-KEM keys.
    - HQC: Disabled HQC by default until [a new security flaw](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/Wiu4ZQo3fP8) is fixed.

  - Digital signature schemes
    - ML-DSA: Improved testing for ML-DSA.
    - CROSS: Updated to NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 version.
    - MAYO: Updated to NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 version.
    - UOV: Added support for UOV algorithm from NIST Additional Signatures Round 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 10 07:51:25 UTC 2024 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Updated to 0.12.0:
  - This release updates the ML-DSA implementation to the [final
    FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) version. This
    release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Dilithium for
    interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Dilithium Round 3 in
    a future release.

  - This will be the last release of liboqs to include Kyber (that is,
    the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber, prior to its standardization by NIST
    as ML-KEM in FIPS 203). Applications should switch to ML-KEM (FIPS 203).

  - The addition of ML-DSA FIPS 204 final version to liboqs has
    introduced a new signature API which includes a context string
    parameter. We are planning to remove the old version of the API
    without a context string in the next release to streamline the
    API and bring it in line with NIST specifications. Users who
    have an opinion on this removal are invited to provide input at
    https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/2001.

  Security issues:

  - CVE-2024-54137: Fixed bug in HQC decapsulation that leads to incorrect
    shared secret value during decapsulation when called with an invalid
    ciphertext. (bsc#1234292)
