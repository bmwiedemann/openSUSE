- Updated to 0.12.0:
  - This release updates the ML-DSA implementation to the [final
    FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final) version. This
    release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Dilithium for
    interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Dilithium Round 3 in
    a future release.

  - This will be the last release of liboqs to include Kyber (that is,
    the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber, prior to its standardization by NIST
    as ML-KEM in FIPS 203). Applications should switch to ML-KEM (FIPS 203).

  - The addition of ML-DSA FIPS 204 final version to liboqs has
    introduced a new signature API which includes a context string
    parameter. We are planning to remove the old version of the API
    without a context string in the next release to streamline the
    API and bring it in line with NIST specifications. Users who
    have an opinion on this removal are invited to provide input at
    https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/2001.

  Security issues:

  - CVE-2024-54137: Fixed bug in HQC decapsulation that leads to incorrect
    shared secret value during decapsulation when called with an invalid
    ciphertext. (bsc#1234292)

- Updated to 0.11.0:
  * This release updates ML-KEM implementations to their final FIPS 203
    https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final versions .
  * This release still includes the NIST Round 3 version of Kyber for
    interoperability purposes, but we plan to remove Kyber Round 3 in a
    future release.
  * Additionally, this release adds support for MAYO and CROSS
    digital signature schemes from [NIST Additional Signatures Round 1
    https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-1-additional-signatures
    along with stateful hash-based signature schemes XMSS
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8391 and LMS
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554.
  * Finally, this release provides formally verified
    implementations of Kyber-512 and Kyber-768 from libjade
    https://github.com/formosa-crypto/libjade/releases/tag/release%2F2023.05-2

  * LMS and XMSS are disabled by default due to the security risks associated with their use in software.
    See the note on stateful hash-based signatures in CONFIGURE.md

  * Key encapsulation mechanisms:

  - Kyber: Added formally-verified portable C and AVX2 implementations
    of Kyber-512 and Kyber-768 from libjade.
  - ML-KEM: Updated portable C and AVX2 implementations of ML-KEM-512,
    ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024 to FIP 203 version.
  - Kyber: Patched ARM64 implementations of Kyber-512, Kyber-768, and
    Kyber-1024 to work with AddressSanitizer.

  * Digital signature schemes:

  - LMS/XMSS: Added implementations of stateful hash-based signature
    schemes: XMSS and LMS
  - MAYO: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of MAYO signature
    scheme from NIST Additional Signatures Round 1.
  - CROSS: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of CROSS signature
    scheme from NIST Additional Signatures Round 1.

  * Other changes:

  - Added callback API to use custom implementations of AES, SHA2, and SHA3.
  - Refactor SHA3 implementation to use OpenSSL's EVP_DigestSqueeze() API.

- new library major version 6

Tue Jun 11 08:39:32 UTC 2024 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 0.10.1:
  This release is a security release which fixes potential
  non-constant-time behaviour in ML-KEM and Kyber. (bsc#1226162
  CVE-2024-36405)

  It also includes a fix for incorrectly named macros in the ML-DSA
  implementation.
