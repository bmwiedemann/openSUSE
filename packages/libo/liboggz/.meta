  <title>Shared libraries for oggz</title>
  <description>liboggz is a library that provides simple parsing and seeking of
files and streams based on the Ogg file format. liboggz requires
libogg to work.
liboggz knows about Ogg speex, Ogg vorbis, Ogg theora, and the Ogg
based Annodex formats, thus allows parsing (though not decoding) of
these files.</description>
