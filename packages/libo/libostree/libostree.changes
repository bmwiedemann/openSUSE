Fri Dec 10 19:38:06 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2021.6:
  + Most of the fixes are related to warnings highlighted by gcc
    -fanalyzer static source analysis.
  + Performance of pruning logic has been improved, avoiding
    unnecessary trips through redundant serialization.
  + A regression has been fixed so that ostree is properly behaving
    again when used from the initramfs, at a point where /sysroot
    may not be mounted yet.
  + A race condition related to sysroot.readonly has been addressed
    by directly setting up sysroot readonly in initramfs.
- Changes from version 2020.8 to 2021.5 please see upstreams list
  https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/releases
- Switch to obs_scm from tar_scm, and use obscpio instead of
  generated tarball. Also stop autogeneration of .changes, upstream
  now have proper release notes that should be used.
- Use ldconfig_scriptlets macro for post(un) handling for shared
  library, modernize spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 19 15:17:22 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2020.8:
  + This release mostly contains scalability improvements and
    bugfixes.
  + Caching-related HTTP headers are now supported on summaries and
    signatures, so that they do not have to be re-downloaded if not
    changed in the meanwhile.
  + Summaries and delta have been reworked to allow more
    fine-grained fetching.
  + Finally, this fixes several bugs related to atomic variables,
    HTTP timeouts, and 32-bit architectures.
- Changes from version 2020.7:
  + Static deltas can now be signed to more easily support offline
    verification.
  + There's now support for multiple initramfs images; the idea
    here is that one can have a "main" initramfs image and a
    secondary one which represents local configuration.
  + The documentation is now moved to
    https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/
  + Lot of preparatory cleanups to the pull code landed for
    upcoming work on indexing deltas outside of the summary.
  + On the bugfix side, the biggest one is a fix for an assertion
    failure when upgrading from systems before ostree supported
    devicetree.
  + Also notable is that ostree no longer hardlinks zero sized
    files to avoid hitting filesystem maximum link counts.
- Changes from version 2020.6:
  + One notable feature: ostree now supports / and /boot being on
    the same filesystem.
  + Other than that it's mostly bugfixes; there is one quite
    important one for anyone using the readonly=true for /sysroot
    (which is still just Fedora CoreOS I suspect).
  + There's some improvements to the GObject Introspection
    metadata, some (cosmetic) static analyzer fixes, a fix for the
    immutable bit on s390x, dropping a deprecated bit in the
    systemd unit file, etc.
- Changes from version 2020.5:
  + This release primarily fixes a regression in 2020.4 where the
    "readonly sysroot" changes incorrectly left the sysroot
    read-only on systems that started out with a read-only / (most
    of them, e.g. Fedora Silverblue/IoT at least).
  + There's some additions to the pull API to aid flatpak.
  + There were a few fixes to the man pages, and ostree show now
    displays the parent commit.
  + The default dracut config now enables reproducibility.
  + On the "feature" side, there is a new ostree admin unlock
    --transient. We expect this to be a foundation for further
   support for "live" updates.
- Changes from version 2020.4:
  + By far the biggest change in this release is new ed25519
    signing support, powered by libsodium.
  + stree commit gained a new --base argument, which significantly
    simplifies constructing "derived" commits, particularly for
    systems using SELinux.
  + Handling of the read-only sysroot was reimplemented to run in
    the initramfs and be more reliable. Enabling the readonly=true
    flag in the repo config is recommended.
  + Several bugs were fixed in locking for the temporary "staging"
    directories OSTree creates, particularly on NFS.
  + lib: Coerce flags enums to GIR bitfields changed some values to
    be (correctly) flags - this may show up as incompatible for
    GObject Introspection consumers (but not C).
  + A new timestamp-check-from-rev option was added for pulls,
    which makes downgrade protection more reliable and will be used
    by Fedora CoreOS.
  + Several fixes and enhancements were made for "collection" pulls
    including a new --mirror option.
  + The ostree commit command learned a new --mode-ro-executables
    which enforces W^R semantics on all executables.
  + A new commit metadata key (OSTREE_COMMIT_META_KEY_ARCHITECTURE)
    was added to help standardize the architecture of the OSTree
    commit. This could be used on the client side for example to
    sanity-check that the commit matches the architecture of the
    machine before deploying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 30 15:13:19 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Stop invalid usage of %_libexecdir:
  + Use %{_prefix}/lib where appropriate.
  + Use _systemdgeneratordir for the systemd-generators.
  + Define _dracutmodulesdir based on dracut.pc. Add
    BuildRequires(dracut) for this to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 06 09:39:45 UTC 2020 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 2020.3:
  * A quick followup to 2020.2, which introduced support for
    read-only sysroot ended up breaking some of the Fedora CoreOS
    tests in coreos-assembler which in turn holds back ostree
    going into FCOS
  * Now that gap has been closed and more of those tests are being
    run on the new CI.

- Update to version 2020.2:
  * lib: Fix Since versions for 2020.1
  * Post-release version bump
  * "Brown paper bag" release that actually sets the
    is_release_build=yes flag and also fixes the Since: on a few
    new functions.

- Update to version 2020.1:
  * There is now support for making the /sysroot mount point
    read-only to start. This protects against a lot of accidental
    damage, and also generalizes and improves the previous special
    case handling of having /boot read-only. One known issue is
    that ostree pull is broken with this enabled, and this will be
    fixed.
  * Error-handling around GPG verification has had an overhaul.
    Specifically, libostree now has more specific error codes to
    distinguish between different verification failures. This
    should allow apps to have more fine-grained control over how
    to respond to errors. Do note that the error messages
    themselves have changed, and we strongly suggest that anyone
    relying on a specific error message string to migrate to using
    the API directly.
  * The original "archive" (split up objects) format didn't make it
    easy for a client system to know how much data it would be
    downloading. Later, static deltas were added which addressed
    this problem, but there are situations in which object fetches
    still occur. Later then support for optional sizes metadata in
    commit objects was added but was never really
    stabilized/publicized. There were also some bugs in it. That is
    now completed - the sizes data is now stable. and new API was
    added to read it.
  * This release adds initial fs-verity support; it doesn't do too
    much today. Bigger picture it's important to understand that
    the vision of OSTree is to enable Linux systems that feel like
    they're "image based" (transactional, versioned updates, no
    dependency resolution client side), but also to enable things
    like doing commits on the client side. Today rpm-ostree
    supports replacing the kernel client side as a first class
    operation. This is crucially important to make it feel truly
    like a Linux system that you own.
  * A small tweak was made to have OSTree create repo structure
    directories and files (such as objects/ or .lock) with group
    write permissions. This is useful for managing OSTree remote
    servers from multiple UIDs. For systems with the default umask
    of 0022, this should have no effect.
  * We've extensively reworked CI for the upstream repo. In
    addition to Travis, testing is now done on top of Fedora
    CoreOS. Not all tests have been carried over, but expect to see
    more coming. This rework will also allow us to have more
    comprehensive tests previously not possible.
  * Several fixes were made to the test suite to handle the cases
    of systemd vs no-systemd, and systemd is now advertised in the
    list of features in ostree --version if present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 14 11:51:44 UTC 2020 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 2019.6:
  * Nothing major in this release, but there is some bigger stuff
    outstanding and ready to merge, so this version was released
    so that work will have time to stabilize.
  * A few build/CI fixes. A new progress API which will be used by
    flatpak (and can be used by others). Finally, we also avoid
    reordering kernel arguments.

- Update to version 2019.5:
  * We discovered that CLang has a static analyzer scan-build;
    it found some small memory leaks so far, otherwise mostly
    noise, but we haven't dug through all the errors yet.
  * Gained a new zipl (s390x bootloader) backend
  * Install the .hmac files needed for FIPS mode in /boot too
  * This is also the first release where we switched to using
    the OpenShift Prow as a merge bot, though a lot more CI work
    is pending.

- Update to version 2019.4:
  * This is mostly a bugfix release. Notably, the 2019.3 release
    caused some issues related to the gpg-agent code spewing
    messages on the terminal. Additionally, Fedora 31 users have
    hit upon issues with ostree-finalize-staged.service running too
    late to be able to write back its logs to the journal. This
    then confused rpm-ostree after reboot, because it looks at the
    previous boot's journal for this message.
  * The biggest feature-ish change is support for a partial commit
    "reason" so that after ostree fsck --delete was used,
    subsequent ostree fsck will continue to report an error. This
    should be used by higher level tools that want to do "fsck and
    repair". It's likely at some point that "fsck and repair"
    logic will move down into the libostree core as well.
  * There are ongoing efforts to port Fedora CoreOS to s390x: one
    fix landed here to add the deployment prefix to BLS entries
    since it's what the zipl bootloader expected.

- Update to version 2019.3:
  * A lot of changes since the last release. On the feature side,
    probably the biggest is we've made public the internal API
    for kernel arguments, which rpm-ostree now uses.
  * Other things include a new --modern switch for init-fs,
    better support in pull for downgrade protection, better
    use of mmap, support for committing archives (tarballs)
    from stdin, etc.
  * Finally, libostree now supports being built without GPG,
    which is an important preparatory piece for introducing
    an alternative signature system.

- Update to version 2019.2:
  + It's been some time since the last release, so this is a
    slightly larger one! There's lots of new features, and a few
    bug fixes.
  + New features:
    * A new sysroot.bootloader key was added to be more explicit
      about which bootloader OSTree should use. Notably a none
      value is supported, in which OSTree is solely responsible
      for writing the BLS entries. This can then be used by
      bootloaders like GRUB2, which now supports BLS natively.
    * ostree config now supports the unset command to unset a key
      from the OSTree repo config
    * ostree remote add now supports the --force flag to replace a
      remote of the same name if it exists
    * ostree-prepare-root now logs a structured journal message
      after finding the deployment to which to pivot. This can be
      used by higher-level apps like RPM-OSTree to build a history
      of the deployments the machine was booted into.
    * The staging API now supports a lockfile which prevents
      finalization at shutdown. This is intended to be used in
      systems that need more fine-tuned control between staging a
      deployment, and setting it as the default deployment on
      reboot.
    * ostree static-delta show now prints the From and To commits
      for which the delta was generated
  + Bug fixes:
    * Make looking up collection-refs similar to how regular refs
      are looked up, i.e. first in the transaction, then in the
      current repo, and then in the parent repo
    * Don't include the OSTree commit version number twice in the
      boot menu title. This affected at least Fedora-based systems
      composed with RPM-OSTree's mutate-os-release.
    * Activate ostree-finalize-staged earlier; this should
      hopefully make deployment finalization more reliable by
      running it later in the shutdown sequence, when less services
      are running
    * Run grub2-mkconfig on the filesystem tree of the pending
      deployment, rather than the previously deployed tree. This
      was a corner case where the deployment failed if a previous
      deployment did not exist, on systems where grub.cfg is used.

Wed Apr 24 09:40:12 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Disable LTO (boo#1133120).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 28 21:09:53 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2019.1:
  + This is the first libostree release of 2019; no big changes,
    just a collection of smaller features and bugfixes.
  + On the features side, a good example is:
    lib/repo: Search a list of paths in gpgkeypath for gpg keys.
  + Another feature is grub2: add support for devicetree.
  + lib/kargs: allow empty-list arguments i.e it ensures libostree
    supports "empty list" kernel arguments.
  + There's also some ongoing work to have libostree be a "backend"
    for OCI/Docker container storage; checkout: honor opaque
    checkouts.
  + If built with --disable-http2, allow enabling via http2=1 will
    allow people to more easily play with HTTP2 if it's disabled by
    default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 14 08:35:59 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 2018.9:
  + New features:
    * Allow disabling pulling from LAN/USB/Internet
    * lib/repo: Add an API to get min-free-space-* reserved bytes
    * OstreeMutableTree: add _remove method
    * repo: Add a checkout option to not hardlink zero-sized files
  + Bugfixes (apart from regular memory leaks fixes):
    * finalize-staged: Bump timeout to 5 minutes
    * deploy: Fix removing /var/.updated with separate /var mount
    * src/ostree: Don't delete refs having aliases
  + One notable change in this release is the initrd service
    ostree-prepare-root.service now runs earlier in the boot
    process. This shouldn't actually affect OSes, unless there's
    extended logic in the initrd that integrates tightly with
    OSTree.
  + Another systemd related change is the introduction of a path
    unit: ostree-finalize-staged.path. This allows the service of
    the same name to be path activated instead of explicitly started
    at deployment staging time. This release however does not yet
    rely on this mechanism to give time for packagers and
    integrators to adapt to the new unit (e.g. by enabling it in
    the systemd presets). A future release will require this. Note
    that deployment staging is still not the default for libostree,
    although at least rpm-ostree now unconditionally uses staging,
    and while it generally worked well, we hit issues with people
    using slower hard drives, hence the increase in timeout in
    PR #1755 .
  + Another change to call out is:
    lib/commit: Don't chown objects to repo target owner.
    We previously had incomplete support for a process running as
    uid 0 writing to a repository owned by a non-zero uid, but it
    was never finished. This will likely be revisited at a later
    time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 09:52:24 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 2018.8:
  + This release is pretty much all minor bugfixes: memory leaks,
    fixing error messages and docs, handling a race condition on
    pull with summary updates. There's one new feature (noted
    below), and we also gained a new contributing tutorial:
    https://mail.gnome.org/archives/ostree-list/2018-August/msg00005.html
  + The one bugfix I want to call out explicitly is:
    ostree-remount.service: RemainAfterExit=yes
    (gh#ostreedev/ostree#1697). It's surprising it took us so long
    to find and fix this; I've seen occasional boot failures that I
    believe trace down to this problem. The behavior of systemd
    units of Type=simple without RemainAfterExit=yes set is rather
    nonsensical; I may try to push to have a warning emitted
    upstream if such a unit is a dependency of another.
  + And the one new feature is the auto-update-summary config
    option for repositories. For more information, see the docs and
    gh#ostreedev/ostree#1681.
- Rebase ostree-grub2-location.patch with quilt.
- Drop libostree-fix-wformat-warnings-on-i586.patch: Fixed
  upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 27 09:10:10 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com
 
- Update to version 2018.7:
  + There's no one major feature in this release, but we have a
    variety of improvements and bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 00:09:52 UTC 2018 - luc14n0@linuxmail.org

    - Rename a variable for clarity.
- Add libostree-fix-wformat-warnings-on-i586.patch to fix 32-bit
  arch building failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 02 05:42:01 UTC 2018 - opensuse-packaging@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2018.4:
  + A quick turnaround after 2018.3 to include one main PR:
    gh#ostreedev/ostree#1508.
  + "switchroot: Ensure /run/ostree-booted is created even without
    initramfs".
  + This fixes ostree when booting without an initramfs. Thanks to
    @akiernan for the bug report and helping review the fix! I'm
    working on enhancing the test suite, which will help in adding
    some coverage here.
- Changes from version 2018.3:
  + Keeping up with our ~monthly cadence. A variety of contributors
    here again, it's great to see! There's two notable features,
    and a variety of non-critical bugfixes.
  + On the features side we have:
    - sysroot: Add concept of deployment "pinning".
    - ostree: introduce PAYLOAD_LINK object type.
    - lib/fetcher: Allow clients to append to User-Agent.
  + By default libostree prunes older deployments; the pinning
    feature allows you to explicitly retain them until unpinned.
    This is useful for major version updates.
  + The PAYLOAD_LINK functionality allows libostree to do
    content-based deduplication. Previously, if e.g. a file changes
    in metadata (mode, owner, xattrs such as SELinux labels), we
    can't make a plain Unix hardlink, and hence by default end up
    with a new copy on disk. However, the Linux kernel has
    standardized "reflinks" and some filesystems support them,
    including modern versions of XFS. When reflinks are available,
    this functionality causes libostree to compute a content-only
    payload, and when importing an object, if it matches in content
    with an existing object, to use reflinks to deduplicate, while
    using different inodes.
  + Finally, the HTTP User-Agent API is intended for higher level
    tools linking to libostree where one wants to expose the app
    version as well.
  + Beyond that, as mentioned above we have a variety of
    non-critical fixes such as memory leaks, test suite
    improvements, correctly printing the "would be pruned" size
    when using prune --no-prune, etc.
- Changes from version 2018.2:
  + We're keeping up with the approximately-monthly release cycle.
    There's mostly a collection of smaller fixes here, with some
    enhancements. I'm biased but my personal favorite is
    gh#ostreedev/ostree#1438 since it makes the output of findmnt
    rather significantly nicer on this workstation where I have
    container tooling creating sub-mounts in /var that are no
    longer replicated in /sysroot.
  + For the embedded space, gh#ostreedev/ostree#1411 for devicetree
    support is likely interesting, and is related to a discussion

  + Jonathan's PR gh#ostreedev/ostree#1441 to add callback
    filtering to checkout was necessary for us to re-implement some
    hairy logic from librpm around "file coloring"; see
    projectatomic/rpm-ostree#1227 We're getting quite far along now
    in having rpm-ostree be a truly hybrid system, supporting the
    existing RPM ecosystem.
  + Marcus definitely wins the "lines changed" count this cycle by
    adding SPDX-License-Identifier to all of the C source files
    (gh#ostreedev/ostree#1439). This happened because we relicensed
    the documentation to dual CC BY-SA and GFDL in
    gh#ostreedev/ostree#1432 to enable a Wikipedia page which I
    just noticed exists now!

Wed Dec 20 10:37:56 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.15:
  + The headlining feature in this release is support for
    repository locking, contributed by Dan Nicholson. Currently it
    is disabled by default; add locking=true in a repository
    configuration file to enable. This feature should be considered
    as "tech preview"; it's highly likely we'll stabilize it in its
    current form, but it's possible something will change.
    Currently the locking only protects commit + prune; there is a
    large pending PR to extend locking to many more APIs and
    commands.
  + Several new APIs were added; for example libostree now has a
    convenient API to break a hardlink, which happens in e.g.
    rpm-ostree in several places such as handling the RPM database.
  + Also, multithreading support in the commit APIs was cleaned up
    and clarified. It's now possible to call transaction_set_ref()
    from multiple threads, which rpm-ostree uses now to import RPMs
    to OSTree in parallel.
  + We're tracking an issue with http2+libcurl and it looks like
    there are a number of issues still floating around
    HTTP2+libcurl (some are server bugs), that we added support at
    both build and runtime to disable http2.
  + The fsck command learned how to verify ref bindings, and
    relatedly, the commit command gained a --unbound option to skip
    creating ref bindings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 20 10:36:05 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.14:
  + This release is almost entirely bugfixes. One notable fix is a
    read-after-free when libcurl is finalizing that some people
    have hit.
  + There are a number of improvements around the ${repo}/tmp
    directory and the per-transaction staging directory in
    preparation for adding locking in a future release. This
    release should already help avoid several failures when doing
    concurrent commits; the aim of the locking work will support
    concurrent prunes and commits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 20 10:35:29 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.13:
  + A lot of across-the-board improvements here; the pure bugfixes
    are mostly in the experimental Avahi bits, hardening the
    FIFREEZE on /boot code, explicit errors when trying to commit
    non-UTF8 filenames, and finally a number of fixes around our
    use of mmap.
  + One slight backwards-incompatible change (but I doubt it'll
    break anyone): Disallow refs starting with a non-letter or
    digit If this does affect you, please let us know ASAP.
  + For improvements, first up, Alex changed the static delta code
    to avoid holding everything in memory; this is a substantial
    improvement for large deltas, and also for flatpak which uses
    deltas as a "bundle" format.
  + A few notable changes:
    - commit: Add _CONSUME modifier flag. You probably want to use
      this by default for your build/package systems.
    - core: Add standard SOURCE_TITLE metadata key. This one I
      think is conceptually quite interesting; for many people,
      their ostree commits are derived from something else that has
      its own versioning, and it's useful to show that explicitly.
      I encourage ostree-based build systems to consider rendering
      human-readable information about your builds into this
      standardized metadata key.
    - On the command line side: cleaning up the --help output
      significantly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 09 13:02:48 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

- Update to version 2017.12:
  + Quite a lot in this release. First, on the notable bugfix side,
    we fixed an issue where background threads could remain alive
    after an error was encountered during pulls. Particularly for
    projects like flatpak that do multiple pulls in process, this
    is an important fix.
  + Another important change related to pulls is that libostree now
    performs checksums when mirroring again. The intent here was to
    speed up mirroring, but it led to a confusing security story.
    Now it's easier to explain: for HTTP pulls we verify checksums
    (and this can be disabled), for local filesystem pulls we
    don't, (but it can be enabled). We've always verified checksums
    by default when pulling from an archive repository into a
    non-archive.
  + Anton Gerasimov contributed a change to the libcurl backend to
    support PKCS#11 URIs, useful for storing certificates in a
    hardware or software enclave.
  + The schema for the experimental OstreeRepoFinderMount API to
    find OSTree repos on removable media has changed incompatibly,
    so that the media doesn’t need to contain two similar lists of
    refs. It will now look in .ostree/repos.d, .ostree/repo,
    ostree/repo and var/lib/flatpak paths on removable media.
  + Similarly, the experimental
    ostree_repo_resolve_keyring_for_collection() API has changed to
    return an OstreeRemote containing the keyring, rather than just
    the keyring, making it more generally useful.
  + The bloom filter used when finding refs from remote peers has
    been fixed to work correctly on 32-bit architectures (such as
    ARM). This doesn’t change the bloom filter format, but will
    require bloom filters created on 32-bit architectures to be
    regenerated in order for advertisements from those machines to
    work.
  + Repositories which have a collection ID set will now put their
    repository metadata in an ostree-metadata ref when ostree
    summary --update is run, in addition to putting it in the
    summary file. This is part of a plan to securely allow unsigned
    summary files for peer-to-peer pulling of refs. This won’t
    happen for repositories which don’t have a collection ID set,
    or if --enable-experimental-api is not configured.
  + A new ostree create-usb command has been added (if configured
    with --enable-experimental-api) which can be used to put refs
    from repositories onto removable media in a format which can be
    detected by OstreeRepoFinderMount. For example, to allow easy
    sharing of flatpaks or OS updates between offline machines.
  + OstreeRepo has gained hash() and equal() methods, so it can now
    easily be used in a hash table based on its device number and
    inode, rather than using its path.
  + A minor bug was fixed in rofiles-fuse, which would cause files
    to be created with random mode bits if called for O_RDONLY.
  + For clients that use OstreeRepoDevInoCache, a bug was fixed
    which caused libostree to ignore callbacks that allow modifying
    file modes, ownership, and extended attributes.
  + libostree now supports --with-crypto=gnutls. Like the OpenSSL
    support, this is currently just checksums, but we are driving
    this towards making the GPG dependency optional and supporting
    other signature methods.
  + In previous releases, libostree learned how to make hardlinks
    for local pulls. But if we couldn't hardlink (e.g. the devices
    were separate), the local pull code went through a much slower
    generic path that included re-checksumming objects. Now there's
    a copy/reflink fast path that uses FICLONE/copy_file_range()
    directly if possible. This can be substantially faster.
  + ostree prune learned a new --only-branch option. This can be a
    lot more convenient for release engineering tasks.
  + As usual, more work was done to improve the testsuite. It
    should now be able to better detect tmpfs/overlayfs
    environments. The upstream CI now also runs tests in a
    non-overlayfs environment for better coverage.
- Changes from version 2017.11:
  + This release has a few new features, some UX improvements for
    the command line, and a variety of bugfixes.
  + The project is now more canonically called "libostree", though
    "OSTree" and "ostree" are also fine.
  + The most important bugfix for anyone using rofiles-fuse
    (typically build systems, rpm-ostree also uses it) is:
    - rofiles-fuse: Fix lchown() and hardlink verification for
      symlinks.
  + On the features side, we've added a few new APIs to the
    libarchive importing and checkout path that will be used by
    rpm-ostree. This should be of interest to anyone using
    libostree for build systems or underlying a hybrid
    image/package system like rpm-ostree.
  + Also on the host system side, there is a new (canonical) place
    for build systems to put the kernel/initramfs:
    /usr/lib/modules/$kver.
  + Make all of the deployments show up in the uboot configuration,
    to help enable automatic fallback if a new OS fails to boot.
  + Lots of style cleanups, some "error prefixing" work to ensure
    we produce understandable errors in more situations,
    and one other notable cleanup: add a tmpfiles.d snippet to
    clean up /var/tmp/ostree-ovl.XXX. This should be nice for
    anyone who uses ostree admin unlock frequently.
  + Improve the management of configuration for remotes.
  + Lots of cleanup in the command line parsing and fixes for
    --help, and also helped with the new --selinux-label option for
    ostree commit.
  + Fix the handling of GPG keys that have subkeys.
  + Fix the build system and tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 20 16:28:49 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.10:
  + In this release Coverity scans were set up , and fixed all of
    the problems it found. None of the issues were critical; the
    only off-by-one array indexing for example was in a test case.
  + Add bash completion.
  + Documentation fixes.
  + There are a number of smaller features:
    - lib/repo: Add API to create and list ref aliases.
    - repo: Introduce ostree_repo_open_at() and
      ostree_repo_create_at() is a notable new API, and finally
      completes our fd-relative porting for OstreeRepo. The
      semantics of these functions are nicer; it's now more
      convenient to unconditionally call ostree_repo_create_at()
      for example to ensure a repository exists, returning the
      opened result.
  + lib/sysroot: Add journal-msg signal is a nice cleanup in that
    we finally stopped doing printf() in the library code for
    OstreeSysroot. If you maintain a client, you should start
    listening for this signal, like the demo command line does (if
    you want the text of course).
  + In the "important bugfixes" category, pull: mark commits from
    local cache as partial fixes up the --localcache-repos logic.
  + Also a number of bugfixes contributed for the collections logic
    as well as cases of trying to download a missing summary file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 13 22:08:40 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.9:
  + A notable new feature in this release is that the pull
    machinery now interprets two new metadata keys:
    ostree.ref-binding and ostree.collection-binding.
    This allows closing a longstanding class of "sidegrade" attacks
    that Florian Weimer identified when performing a security audit
    of libostree years ago (bgo#724873).
    There was a more recent discussion on this topic on the list:
    https://mail.gnome.org/archives/ostree-list/2017-May/msg00013.html
  + For the ostree-as-host case, this only matters if you offer
    multiple refs. For flatpak, it's more important as a MITM
    attacker could actually switch applications; that's why flatpak
    implemented this a while ago as xa.ref.
  + I'll note here that it's recommended for content providers to
    make use of ostree's support for tls-ca-path to implement TLS
    CA pinning, which protects all metadata and content in a strong
    fashion; in this scenario the GPG signatures act as a secondary
    layer of defense and make offline verification easier (for e.g.
    mirroring).
  + Otherwise, there's some performance enhancements for local
    pulls, and a variety of bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 20 22:28:38 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.8:
  + This is a quicker release closely following 2017.7, but it
    still includes a number of changes. First, a lot of work is
    landing from Philip/Krzesimir for doing "collections" and
    pulling content from Avahi/USB drives etc. That work is still
    underneath --enable-experimental-api, but look for more from
    that soon!
  + Other notable user-visible features from this cycle are:
    - lib/repo: Add min-free-space-percent option, default 3%.
    - Add "pull --localcache-repo".
  + An important bugfix for bare-user repo mode owners is:
    lib/commit: Ensure bare-user objects are always
    user-readable.
  + Besides that we have a lot of code cleanup, CI work, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 29 13:27:54 UTC 2017 - aplazas@suse.com

- Update to version 2017.7:
  + The most notable thing for this release is that for flatpak
    users/distributors, this release adds a lot of (opt-in)
    hardening against setuid or world-writable files. These issues
    are also (to a lesser degree) applicable to ostree-based build
    systems which use the bare-user repository mode. A pending
    flatpak version will require this version of libostree.
  + For ostree-as-host, we fixed a major regression in SELinux
    labeling for /etc (only applies to SELinux-using host systems).
  + Known issue: test-symbols.sh will fail when building from the
    tarball (as opposed to a git clone).
  + Besides that, there's various smaller cleanups and fixes. It's
    great to see contributors from a variety of organizations;
    having libostree be a shared infrastructure layer across
    distributions is a longstanding vision.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 16 21:11:18 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.6:
  + One of the most notable changes in this release is that we
    switched to using a systemd generator for handling /var, which
    means admins can now set it up as an explicit mount point. We
    feel pretty confident in the code, but do test your specific
    setup. One note in particular; the new model (obviously)
    requires systemd, and while we tried to preserve the
    non-systemd path, it wasn't explicitly tested.
  + The work to port to a new code style continues rapidly; at this
    point most of the library is converted, with just the command
    line remaining. I think the new style is a lot more readable
    now that we rely fully on __attribute__((cleanup)).
  + Enhance the OstreeAsyncProgress reporting API, which I think is
    going to be quite useful for user interface frontends (like
    GNOME Software).
  + There's a smattering of smaller bugfixes; minor memory leaks,
    double close() and the like. In this cycle we also beefed up
    our CI/testing more - we now test both Fedora Atomic Host and
    flatpak more explicitly. Contributions to extend the suite to
    other distributions would be appreciated; for example, tests
    for ostree-as-host on Debian. Our Travis-executed tests should
    be extensible.
  + Fix some of the test suite for installed tests, and also
    introspection fixes for language bindings.
  + Another feature that involved a lot of internal changes is our
    handling for /etc on SELinux-based systems. We now label files
    as we go rather than having a more fragile separate relabeling
    path. This is also exposed as an API, which is used by
    rpm-ostree now. I think this particular change highlights the
    strength of "libostree" as an API that can be reused by higher
    level systems.
- Changes from version 2017.5:
  + This is a bugfix release for 2017.4 to fix a regression that
    broke flatpak.
- Changes from version 2017.4:
  + A notable new feature in this release is a fourth repository
    mode: "bare-user-only". This is very similar to bare-user, but
    canonicalizes permissions and ignores xattrs. The intended
    use of this is for "non-OS" container tools such as flatpak,
    where one intentionally discards the traditional file
    ownership. (I'm calling this container case "non-OS" to
    distinguish from other container tools where one might want to
    "log in" via PAM and supporting distinct UIDs inside a single
    container is valuable)
  + We have a few new APIs, such as ostree_check_version() which is
    important when making use of some of the "API extensions" we
    have using GVariant on e.g. ostree_repo_pull_with_options().
  + The diff is a bit larger due to us switching to a new code
    style.
  + Another quite important change is that ostree trivial-httpd is
    disabled by default. With a libcurl build, this is the last
    part that links to libsoup. It's only needed for unit tests, so
    can be subpackaged or discarded. (We're doing the latter for
    Fedora).
  + Speaking of curl, we now support --with-openssl which enables
    using OpenSSL's libcrypto for SHA256. This can be notably
    faster. You likely want this if e.g. libcurl is already linked
    to OpenSSL for you. I'm increasingly confident in the curl
    code, and should be ready to recommend using it by default in
    the next release or two.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 10 16:42:57 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2017.1:
  + This release has mostly bugfixes, the main new feature is that
    the prune command gained more sophistication around selectively
    pruning branches. We're planning to use this in Project Atomic
    work where we want to co-locate both "development" and "stable"
    branches in the same repository.
  + The next release is likely to be more exciting, as we have an
    additional new libcurl backend in the works - this release
    contains some preparatory cleanup for that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 22 14:31:35 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2016.15:
  + This release is mostly bugfixes - for example, it cleans up the
    vast majority of memory leaks caught by ASAN. We also build
    without libsoup again, which is preparatory for a potential
    addition of a libcurl HTTP backend.
  + Another notable change is that we now always checksum
    individual objects even when applying static deltas, regardless
    of whether or not the summary file is signed. This is part of
    an ongoing thread about supporting OCI as a transport layer.
- Add pkgconfig(zlib) BuildRequires: configure explicitly checks
  for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  + Filter bootloader supplied kernel cmdline options.
  + repo: Don't put remote refs in the summary file.
  + pull: Don't do deltas with --commit-metadata-only.
  + pull: Add per-remote cookie jar.
  + remote: Add command to list cookies.
  + remote: Add commands to add and remove cookies for a remote.

- Add pkgconfig(libsystemd) BuildRequires: configure explicitly
  calls on both .pc names (systemd and libsystemd). We do want to
  stay independent of potential systemd packaging changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 14 22:36:03 UTC 2016 - dmacvicar@suse.de

- Update to version 2016.8:
  + Almost entirely bugfixes. Most notable is a fix for a
    relatively rare race condition in the pull code on cleanup
    (after completion), and also a memory leak.
  + Besides that, there are improvements for the test suite, some
    more porting away from libgsystem, a bugfix for static deltas
    important to flatpak, build tweaks for older glib, etc.
- Changes from 2016.7:
  + There's quite a lot of changes in this release since 2016.5,
    but one thing to call out explicitly it is a fixed race
    condition in the HTTP pull code that could cause hangs or
    crashes that mostly occurred only when doing "large" pulls
    (thousands of object requests). If this occurs, client systems
    can work around it by cancelling and retrying the pull.

Sun Aug  9 13:01:44 UTC 2015 - fcrozat@suse.com

- Update to version 2015.7:
  + critical update for v2015.4: fix a bug causing unpredictable
    ordering of generated syslinux/uboot/grub2 bootloader entries.
  + Performance enhancement for deployments; rely on syncfs()
    rather than individual fsync() calls.
  + GPG: Always retrieve detached metadata, so we'll find newly
    added signatures.
  + GPG: Support for keys specific to remotes, rather than relying
    on the global /usr/share/ostree/trusted.gpg.d
  + A new locking API (used for the commandline) so that concurrent
    invocations of e.g. `ostree admin upgrade` are safe.
  + Other enhancements targeted for the Cockpit program and
    rpm-ostree.
  + The summary file can now be GPG signed as well (preview).
  + Other changes to static deltas, which continue to evolve.
