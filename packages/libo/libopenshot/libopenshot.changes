- Update to version 0.3.2:
  * Adding lock around SetCache method, which causes some crashes. Detected in Sentry: OPENSHOT-1Q
  * Fixing memory leak on Clips, where we were not clearing cache on Close, or forcing Close on destruction. Especially noticeable on projects with a ton of clips. Tweaking unit tests to prevent crash due to new Clip destructor behavior when using stack variables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 30 15:23:17 UTC 2021 - tiwai@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 08:46:46 UTC 2021 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.2.6+5:
  * Merge master 0.2.6 into develop
  * set default crop border to 0
  * Update Version to 0.2.6 SO 20
  * Link catch-main wtih Catch2::Catch2 (#714)
  * Bug fix. Prevent adding the same clip as child in the Tracker and Object Detection Effects
  * Fixing SVG unit tests to correctly check the default SVG size
  * SCALE_NONE was incorrectly sizing SVG, Image, and Video files. Since OpenShot changes the preview window size during editing, the SCALE_NONE clips should always be scaled to the ratio: preview / timeline... so they stay relative sized to the timeline size.
  * FFmpeg: Create, use av_err2string() (#689)
  * Fixed Draw Box property in ObjectDetection Effect
  * Prevent re initializing ParametricEQ  for each frame

  * Added voice robotization and whisperization effect working
  * removed comment with number
  * Fix audio encoding on FFmpeg 4.4. AVFrame was missing a few properties that need to be set in newer versions of FFmpeg. This is also compatible with FFmpeg 3+.
  * Reverting video_timestamp increment logic which used pkt.duration. In some codecs (such as vp8), this approach breaks due to differences in the timebase vs the framerate. For example, if the timebase is an inverse of the FPS, everything works. But if the timebase is not, for example 1/1000000, this approach breaks.
  * Only get rotation from metadata if 0 keyframes
  * Unit tests: --output-on-failure
  * Switch to pkt.duration for incrementing PTS, and rename the 2 timestamp variables to something more sane.
  * Experimental conversion of timestamp rescaling to use the av_packet_rescale_ts() method. I'm just not sure the backwards compatibility of this approach with older FFmpeg versions.
  * We already init values in constructor, and moving incrementing to later in function.
  * FFmpeg: Move av/swresample decision into CMake (#693)

  * More permissive range interval for Tracker test
  * Fixed Json in Tracker Tests

  * Fixing regression with Waveform generation.
  * Add CODECOV_TOKEN envvar to Github CI
  * Disabling Clip caching and fixing a bug with waveform()
  * Large refactor of OpenMP integration (or rather the removal of OpenMP on the Timeline and FFmpeg-related classes). The logic behind this decision, was based on profiling libopenshot and the amount of wasted CPU idle time on all the various threads. The slow code is still synchronous, and all the threads must wait on each other, adding additional overhead. So, removing lots of unneeded threads, and simplifying the underlying Timeline->Clip->FFmpegReader flow. Also, removed 2 calls to QPainter::drawImage, by improving the flexibility of Clip->GetFrame.
  * Reducing the # of threads on the Timeline in half, with a minimum of 4. Trying to experiment and reduce stuttering.
  * Improving performance after working with google-prof, to profile CPU. Calling OMP_MP_NUM_PROCESSORS less often, since it's quite expensive according to profiling. Adjusting Timeline final_cache to match the video caching thread max_frames, so one doesn't clobber the other. Also, fixing an issue with openshot-player, where a video file with no audio skips horribly.
  * Minor fix
  * Added support to set an effect's properties by it's parent effect
  * Updated JSON functions related to Tracked Objects
  * Added support to insert the image of a clip inside a Tracked Object
  * Added support to set the visibility of a Tracked Object
  * Increasing Linux build threads... experimental

  * Add Exceptions.h include to new effects
  * Fixing scope issue and unused var

  * Updated variable names
  * Added support to attach a clip to another clip
  * ObjectDetection: updated object selection and transform handler
  * Added support to show the transform handler for the selected object
  * Coordinate_Tests: include Exceptions.h
  * Fraction: Implement dict type methods
  * Effect GetFrame(): Use std::make_shared
  * Thanks to @ferdnyc for the suggestion to better detect alpha channels.
  * Until I find a better method of detecting pix_fmt's that have an alpha channel, I'm going with a simple list. Not sure if this will work well with older versions of FFmpeg though, as these items change over time. Waiting to see how build servers handle it.
  * Move Exceptions.h includes to .cpp files
  * Restore (unused) TooManySeeks exception, deprecate
  * Updated documentation
  * ObjectDetection: show object's icons and transform handlers per frame

  * Improvement to video caching thread, to recover from the separation of cache vs display frame #. Also found a mutex that was needed, to prevent crashing when the video thread calls timeline::GetFrame at certain times... colliding with another thread (and independent of OpenMP).
  * Added 2 new unit tests for Clip's with a Timeline associated with them, and FFmpegReaders with a Clip/Timeline associated with them.
  * Added 2 FrameMapper unit tests which verify resampled audio data has no gaps/pops, and offset FrameMapper clips don't use the wrong # of audio samples
  * Removing invalid ICC sRGB color profile from these PNG used in unit tests (which throw warnings)
  * - Added default caption value, for demonstration purposes (to help users see a valid example) - Append some newlines onto the end of any caption text... needed by the regex for some reason - Updated font name and caption text to be a new type (font and caption), and we have corresponding UI changes for those on openshot-qt

  * Replacing ARGB32_Premultiplied with Format_RGBA8888_Premultiplied, which still seems to benefit from performance, but keeps the byte order the same as before. win win
  * Converting RGB8888 to ARGB32_Premultiplied (for performance reasons)
  * Replacing audio fix implementation with ParentClip(), to access clip start and position (if any)
  * Implemented position remapper inside FrameMapper to fix audio noise when exporting to different fps
  * Initializing Clip info struct, and fixing clip cache settings
  * Initialize parent clip variable
  * Fixing some regressions on image merging
  * Large refactor of Timeline, TimelineBase, ClipBase, and Clip, to allow a Clip access to the parent timeline instance (if available), and thus, certain properties (preview size, timeline FPS, etc...). This allows for a simpler rendering of Clip keyframes (during the Clip::GetFrame method), and a simpler Timeline class, that can change the preview window size dynamically and no longer requires a Singleton Settings class.  - Also removed "crop" from Clip class, as it was never implmeneted correctly, and we have a fully functional "crop" effect when needed  - Added caching to Clip class, to optimize previewing of cached frames (much faster than previous)
  * Fixed a bug with cropping logic on Clip (disabled it temporarily). I need to replace the Crop functionality with a more robust cropping tool. Also, updated Timeline to use the MaxWidth/MaxHeight settings when calling the clip (since those are set when the screen is resized).
  * Refactored the Settings::Instance()->MAX_WIDTH and Settings::Instance()->MAX_HEIGHT out of the Cilp class. GetFrame() now has an overload which specifies the width, height, and samples needed. Otherwise, it returns the Clip image based on the source reader (width, height, num samples).
  * - Refactoring all Timeline drawing code into the Clip class - Making Clip a proper Reader (so it can be used directly, instead of a Timeline)

  * Allow sub-pixel sized pen stroke
  * Adding initial caption effect, which supports VTT and SubRip formats (limited support, no formating, no regions)
  * Fixing some regressions on image merging
  * Large refactor of Timeline, TimelineBase, ClipBase, and Clip, to allow a Clip access to the parent timeline instance (if available), and thus, certain properties (preview size, timeline FPS, etc...). This allows for a simpler rendering of Clip keyframes (during the Clip::GetFrame method), and a simpler Timeline class, that can change the preview window size dynamically and no longer requires a Singleton Settings class.  - Also removed "crop" from Clip class, as it was never implmeneted correctly, and we have a fully functional "crop" effect when needed  - Added caching to Clip class, to optimize previewing of cached frames (much faster than previous)
  * CMake: Switch default build type to Release
  * Add ENABLE_MAGICK CMake option (default ON)
  * This padding is needed to not lose samples in the first frame of a resample. Apparently, we need enough padding, so we exceed the # of samples required for the first frame, and 20 was just too low for many frame rates / sample rates.
  * Frame: Reduce code duplication
  * VideoRenderWidget: missing includes
  * Pixelate: Fix missing includes
  * Frame: Use delegating constructors

  * README: Wrap to 80-col, copyright => 2020
  * Timeline.h: Formatting
  * Const temporary variable

  * Clip: GetEffect implementation
  * Timeline.h: Add lots of openshot:: prefixes
  * ReaderBase: Deprecate SetClip/GetClip names
  * Use MacOS 10.11 SDK (still targeting 10.9)
  * Fixed a bug with cropping logic on Clip (disabled it temporarily). I need to replace the Crop functionality with a more robust cropping tool. Also, updated Timeline to use the MaxWidth/MaxHeight settings when calling the clip (since those are set when the screen is resized).
  * Refactored the Settings::Instance()->MAX_WIDTH and Settings::Instance()->MAX_HEIGHT out of the Cilp class. GetFrame() now has an overload which specifies the width, height, and samples needed. Otherwise, it returns the Clip image based on the source reader (width, height, num samples).
  * - Refactoring all Timeline drawing code into the Clip class - Making Clip a proper Reader (so it can be used directly, instead of a Timeline)

  * Integrate Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for FFmpegWriter (#186)
  * Improving cache performance by preventing the cache from getting behind the currently displaying frame # (#179)

  * Invalid SetMaxSize Logic and Invalid CRF q settings in FFmpegWriter (#198)
  * Refactor FFmpegWriter Open() and PrepareStreams() methods, so that SetOption() can be called between them. (#193)
  * Some polishing for the cmake ReSVG discovery (#187)

Mon Sep 24 09:56:15 UTC 2018 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 0.2.2
  * FFmpeg 3 & 4 support
  * Fixed crash with masks and transitions
  * Fixed many bugs around FPS and video length calculation (especially for MP3 and streaming WEBM formats)
  * Protecting samples_per_frame calculation to keep from crashing on undetected FPS
  * OpenMP schedule change (added stability)
  * Limiting threads for both FFmpeg and OpenMP (attempting to find a good balance of parallel performance, while not spawning too many threads). Sometimes more is not always better.
  * Travis CI integration
  * Fix install paths for headers and effects (Jeff Shillitto - jeffski)
  * Fix bug with FFmpeg > 3.2 flushing frames (Jeff Shillitto - jeffski)
  * Adding "reader" property for Mask effect, to allow the user to adjust the image or video used by the mask effect.
  * Fixing bitrate calculation (to be in bytes instead of bits)
  * Adding in FPS detection for files which don't have valid FPS. In those cases (streaming files for example), we iterate through all packets, and average the # of frames, duration, bit rate, etc... Not ideal, but a better fallback.
