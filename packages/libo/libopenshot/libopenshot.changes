Sun Aug 18 08:31:15 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to current master (devel) branch, fixes build for Factory.
- Run spec-cleaner, use modern macros.
- Enable ruby-devel BuildRequires, fixed upstream.
- Replace ImageMagick-devel with disabled pkgconfig(Magick++)
  BuildRequires, it's not detected either way.

Fri May  3 08:08:51 UTC 2019 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 0.2.3
  * Bumping version to 0.2.3 (SO 17)
  * Integration of resvg SVG library (optional during build) (#185)
  * Improved Keyframe Performance (#197)
  * MP3 Special Handling & Missing Frame Refactor (#196)
  * Fix default sizes on readers without MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT settings (#188)
  * Adding new settings class to be used for changing realtime settings used by libopenshot, such as scaling mode for preview vs final render, or hardware decode, etc... (#183)
  * Integrate Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for FFmpegWriter (#186)
  * Improving cache performance by preventing the cache from getting behind the currently displaying frame # (#179)
  * Set video bit rate to 0 if an invalid bit rate detected (which happens when using crf) (#191)
  * Invalid SetMaxSize Logic and Invalid CRF q settings in FFmpegWriter (#198)
  * Refactor FFmpegWriter Open() and PrepareStreams() methods, so that SetOption() can be called between them. (#193)
  * Some polishing for the cmake ReSVG discovery (#187)
  * Adding condition before calling av_frame_free (in AV_FREE_FRAME macro) (#184)
  * tests/CMakeLists: Use same dependencies as src/ (#163)
  * Remove Eclipse files and add to gitignore (#178)
  * Fixing Scale Mode (None) in previews (#182)
  * Exclude git tags from kicking off GitLab builds (for libopenshot)
  * Update readme to use markdown and update copyright to 2019 (#94)
  * Update README and INSTALL files (including build instructions) (#194)
  * Add git log file with commits up to the previous release (#192)

Mon Sep 24 09:56:15 UTC 2018 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 0.2.2
  * FFmpeg 3 & 4 support
  * Fixed crash with masks and transitions
  * Fixed many bugs around FPS and video length calculation (especially for MP3 and streaming WEBM formats)
  * Protecting samples_per_frame calculation to keep from crashing on undetected FPS
  * OpenMP schedule change (added stability)
  * Limiting threads for both FFmpeg and OpenMP (attempting to find a good balance of parallel performance, while not spawning too many threads). Sometimes more is not always better.
  * Travis CI integration
  * Fix install paths for headers and effects (Jeff Shillitto - jeffski)
  * Fix bug with FFmpeg > 3.2 flushing frames (Jeff Shillitto - jeffski)
  * Adding "reader" property for Mask effect, to allow the user to adjust the image or video used by the mask effect.
  * Fixing bitrate calculation (to be in bytes instead of bits)
  * Adding in FPS detection for files which don't have valid FPS. In those cases (streaming files for example), we iterate through all packets, and average the # of frames, duration, bit rate, etc... Not ideal, but a better fallback.
- soname change to 16
