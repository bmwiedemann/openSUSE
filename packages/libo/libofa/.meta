  <title>Open Fingerprint Architecture Library</title>
  <description>MusicDNS and the Open Fingerprint Architecture provide a system for
identifying a piece of music with nothing more than the sound of the
piece itself.
This library is by design compatible with the MusicDNS web service.
Non-commercial access to the service is available at
http://www.musicdns.org.</description>
