Sun Mar 17 17:39:54 UTC 2024 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.7.5:
  * [Sec] Null-pointer write (32bit platforms) or excessive memory
    allocation (64bit platforms) when reading close to 4GiB of data
    from unseekable files..
  * [Sec] Write buffer overflow when reading unseekable files close
    to 4GiB in size.
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-memory (32bit platforms) or excessive
    memory allocation (64bit platforms) when reading malformed data
    from unseekable files.
  * [Sec] DMF: Possible null-pointer write or excessive memory
    allocation when reading DMF files.
  * IT: In the previous version, Zxx macros in IT files made with
    older MPT versions were no longer working.
  * There was a periodic click when playing a module using the
    Chorus or Flanger DMO plugin at a mix rate exceeding
    ~136.5 kHz.
  * An older bugfix for undefined behaviour in the Distortion DMO
    plugin was incorrect, causing the distorted sound to be
    different in some situations.
  * xmp-openmpt: Metadata retrievel for playlist items was broken.
- Changes in 0.7.4:
  * [Bug] Makefile: libopenmpt 0.7.3 broke running the test suite
    for Emscripten builds.
  * openmpt123: openmpt123 now uses a narrower layout on terminal
    windows with a width of less than 72 characters.
  * Setting all possible load_skip flags resulted in nothing being
    loaded at all, instead of just not loading the selected module
    parts.
  * When playing all subsongs, set_position_seconds didn’t always
    calculate the correct subsong to jump to.
  * IT: A few more compatibility flags are now disabled for modules
    saved with earlier Schism Tracker versions.
  * IT: MIDI macros were reset in IT 2.14 / 2.15 files that
    declared to be compatible with older IT versions
    (fixes spx-visionsofthepast.it).
  * OKT: Work around missing negative arpeggio implementation by
    transposing the notes up an octave.
  * OKT: Channel volume commands were sometimes lost over less
    important effects.
  * IMF: Ignore magic bytes in sample header. “Leaving All Behind”
    by Karsten Koch uses unexpected magic bytes, Orpheus ignores
    them just like the instrument header magic bytes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 00:48:48 UTC 2023 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.7.3:
  * Fix: set_pitch_factor no longer affected OPL instruments since
    version 0.6.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 29 09:03:50 UTC 2023 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.2:
  * [New] MOD: Can now read modified 8-channel MOD files from the DOS game Aleshar - The World Of Ice.
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-bounds read or write when reading malformed MED files. (r19389)
  * [Bug] The Opal OPL3 emulator symbols were not namespaced properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  8 08:37:38 UTC 2023 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.7.1
  * IT: Improved fingerprinting of early ModPlug Tracker versions.
  * XMF: Modules from Astroidea demos can now be read as well.
- Changes in 0.7.0:
  * [New] 667 files from Composer 667 are now supported.
  * [New] GTK and GT2 files from Gramouf Tracker are now supported.
  * [New] Can now read a variant of the DSMI AMF format called DMF,
    as found in various DOS games distributed by Webfoot (Tronic,
    H2O, PowBall, etc.).
  * [New] DSM files from Dynamic Studio are now supported.
  * [New] XMF files from the DOS game Imperium Galactica are now
    supported.
  * [New] Can now read the hacked MOD format (DMF) from the game
    “Apocalypse Abyss”.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New APIs for getting the current tempo as a
    floating point value: openmpt::module::get_current_tempo2()
    (C++), and openmpt_module_get_current_tempo2() (C).
  * [New] C API: New stream callbacks for various platform
    extensions to the C stdio interface:
      openmpt_stream_get_file_posix_lfs64_callbacks()
      in libopenmpt/libopenmpt_stream_callbacks_file_posix_lfs64.h
      for explicit off64_t on Posix systems,
      openmpt_stream_get_file_posix_callbacks()
      in libopenmpt/libopenmpt_stream_callbacks_file_posix.h
      for off_t on Posix systems,
      openmpt_stream_get_file_msvcrt_callbacks()
      in libopenmpt/libopenmpt_stream_callbacks_file_msvcrt.h
      for 64bit file support on Windows systems with the Microsoft
      C runtime, and openmpt_stream_get_file_mingw_callbacks()
      in libopenmpt/libopenmpt_stream_callbacks_file_mingw.h
      for 64bit file support when targetting MinGW.
      The old openmpt_stream_get_file_callbacks() has been
      deprecated in favour of a stricly standard conforming
      openmpt_stream_get_file_callbacks2() in the same
      libopenmpt/libopenmpt_stream_callbacks_file.h header.
      libopenmpt/libopenmpt.h defines
      LIBOPENMPT_STREAM_CALLBACKS_FILE_POSIX_LFS64,
      LIBOPENMPT_STREAM_CALLBACKS_FILE_POSIX,
      LIBOPENMPT_STREAM_CALLBACKS_FILE_MSVCRT,
      and LIBOPENMPT_STREAM_CALLBACKS_FILE_MINGW respectively
      in order to allow for checking header availability.
  * [New] C API: New stream callbacks for memory buffers.
    openmpt_stream_get_buffer_callbacks() and
    openmpt_stream_buffer_init() are deprecated.
    Use openmpt_stream_get_buffer_callbacks2() and
    openmpt_stream_buffer_init2() instead.
    The new variants do not support loading only a file prefix and
    checking for overflow any more. This was only useful when using
    the old openmpt_could_open_probability2() style interface from
    the libopenmpt 0.2 API, which has been superseded by
    openmpt_probe_file_header(),
    openmpt_probe_file_header_without_filesize(), and
    openmpt_probe_file_header_from_stream() in libopenmpt 0.3.0.
  * [New] libopenmpt_ext: New interface interactive3 adding
    openmpt::ext::interactive3::set_current_tempo2() (C++) and
    openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive3.set_current_tempo2()
    (C) which allow setting non-integer tempo values.
  * [New] New Makefile option CONFIG=mingw-w64 which consolidates
    all MinGW-w64 build configurations with the following options:
    MINGW_FLAVOUR=[|-posix|-win32], WINDOWS_ARCH=[x86|amd64],
    WINDOWS_FAMILY=[|desktop-app|app|phone-app|pc-app],
    and WINDOWS_VERSION=[win95|win98|winme|winnt4|win2000|winxp|winxp64|winvista|win7|win8|win8.1|win10|win11].
  * [New] New Makefile option CONFIG=mingw which consolidates all
    MinGW build configurations with the following options:
    MINGW_FLAVOUR=[|-posix|-win32],
    and WINDOWS_VERSION=[win95|win98|winme|winnt4|win2000|winxp].
  * [New] Building with MSYS2 is now fully supported for Makefile
    and Autotools build systems.
  * [New] Makefile CONFIG=djgpp now supports CPU= option to build
    optimized for a particular CPU. See build/make/config-djgpp.mk
    for all available options. FLAVOURED_DIR=1 places the
    CPU-specific optimized builds in separate folders below bin/.
  * [New] Building with a MinGW32 CRTDLL toolchain is now supported
    via Makefile option CONFIG=mingw32crt.
  * [New] Makefile now uses PKG_CONFIG as path to pkg-config.
  * [New] The C++ API is now also enabled for Emscripten builds
    by default.
  * [New] Support for GCC 7 has been restored.
  * [New] Support for Clang 6 has been restored.
  * [New] Support for Android NDK 18 has been restored.
  * [New] openmpt123: --banner [0|1|2] allows changing the
    openmpt123 banner style to hidden, shown, or verbose,
    respectively.
  * [New] openmpt123: --assume-terminal allows skipping the
    openmpt123 terminal check, and thus allows running the UI with
    non-terminal stdin, which can be useful for some very basic
    remote control functionality.
  * [Change] xmp-openmpt: The Amiga resampler emulation is now
    enabled by default.
  * [Change] in_openmpt: The Amiga resampler emulation is now
    enabled by default.
  * [Change] The official Windows builds (x86, amd64, arm, arm64)
    now require Windows 10 21H2 (or later). The official legacy
    Windows builds (x86-legacy, amd64-legacy) are unchanged and
    still require Windows 7 (or later).
  * [Change] "date" metadata will now exlude the UTC time zone
    signifier Z if the precise time zone is unknown.
  * [Change] ctl seek.sync_samples now defaults to 1.
  * [Change] Makefile CONFIG=generic is gone. Please use
    CONFIG=standard instead.
  * [Change] Makefile CONFIG=macosx and CONFIG=haiku have been
    removed. The OS is auto-detected.
  * [Change] Makefile options CONFIG=mingw64-win32,
    CONFIG=mingw64-win64, CONFIG=mingw64-winrt-x86,
    CONFIG=mingw64-winrt-amd64, and CONFIG=mingw-win9x have been
    replaced by CONFIG=mingw-w64, and CONFIG=mingw.
  * [Change] Autotools now default to C++20 and only fall back to
    C++17 when C++20 is not supported.
  * [Change] Makefile now defaults to C++20 and only falls back to
    C++17 when C++20 is not supported by the compiler.
  * [Change] Makefile now defaults to C17 and only falls back to
    C11 when C17 is not supported by the compiler.
  * [Change] Makefile CONFIG=djgpp option USE_ALLEGRO42 now
    defaults to 1 and implies building a liballegro42 locally.
    This requires executing build/download_externals.sh before
    building to download the liballegro42 sources.
  * [Change] in_openmpt: The Winamp input plugin in_openmpt is now
    deprecated for use with the latest Winamp or WACUP releases.
    Please use the native implementations available in
    Winamp >=5.9.0 or WACUP instead. This does not mean that
    in_openmpt/in_mod will not receive further development,
    it just means that the responsibility now lies with the player
    implementors themselves. We will still maintain the status quo
    of our in_openmpt input plugin for users of earlier Winamp
    version, or users on older systems, or users of compatible
    players.
  * [Change] The POSIX fd file callbacks implementation now handles
    EINTR and retries the read() call.
  * [Regression] Full support for Visual Studio 2017 has been
    removed. We still support targeting Windows XP with
    Visual Studio 2017.
  * [Regression] Support for mingw-std-threads has been removed.
    If you require a thread-safe libopenmpt, please build with
    POSIX threading model and/or complain to MinGW/GCC about not
    properly supporting C++11 features in 2023.
  * [Regression] Support for Emscripten versions older than 3.1.1
    has been removed.
  * [Regression] C API: openmpt_stream_get_file_callbacks() used to
    provide 64bit file access on some platforms where long is
    32bit. This never worked reliably for all platforms though.
    The behaviour is now changed to always stick to what standard
    C supports with fseek and ftell, where the offset type is long.
    openmpt_stream_get_file_callbacks() is deprecated now due to
    behavioral change.
    Please migrate to openmpt_stream_get_file_callbacks2().
  * [Regression] Using the system-provided liballegro42 is no
    longer supported. The option BUNDLED_ALLEGRO42=1 does not exist
    any more.
  * Reduced aliasing when downsampling with the Sinc + Low-Pass
    resampler.
  * The sample position is now rounded instead of truncated when
    resampling without interpolation.
  * Seeking with sample sync now supports portamento up / down
    commands as well as IMF/ PTM note slides. Tone portamento is
    now synchronized correctly when seeking in DBM, 669 and MED
    with fast slides (first tick of portamento was previously not
    executed).
  * The filter cutoff frequency is no longer rounded to integer
    frequency values.
  * MED: Tempos higher than 255 BPM can now be imported in pattern
    data.
  * MED: MMD1 files with more than 16 channels are now supported.
  * ULT: Import 8-bit volume commands with full precision.
  * IT: Initial “last note memory” of every channel is C-0, so a
    lone instrument number without note triggers that note.
  * S3M: Better approximation of old “stereo control” SAx command
    used in Purple Motion’s PANIC.S3M.
  * S3M: In ScreamTracker 3.03 and later, OPL notes with tone
    portamento next to them are delayed until the next row and then
    the new pitch is used instantly.
  * MO3: Envelope sustain was not imported correctly if the source
    file was an XM.
  * MOD: Lone instrument number with retrigger effect swap sample
    immediately.
  * Recalling a sample’s default volume using an instrument number
    (as opposed to regular volume commands) previously ramped the
    volume change smoothly over a whole tick. Now the
    user-configured ramp settings are used instead (as it would
    happen when using a volume command to achieve the same effect).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 18 18:50:53 UTC 2023 - Antonio Teixeira <antonio.teixeira@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.10
  * [Bug] File probing and loading results could be inconsistent
    for SFX files, so that probing could claim that a file is
    definitely not playable even if it would be.
  * MOD: VBlank heuristics are now applied to MOD files with M!K!
    signature. Fixes mod.siedler ii.
  * NoiseTracker MODs are now always played with VBlank timing.
  * MED: Add support for default instrument pitch.
  * MED: Global play transpose value was not considered for MMD0
    files.
  * 669: Reject files with lots of control characters in song
    message.
  * mpg123: Update to v1.31.3 (2023-03-19).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 29 02:43:44 UTC 2023 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.6.9
  * [Bug] An exception could be thrown during rendering when trying
    to access the release node of an empty envelope.
  * The fix for the OPL cutoff bug introduced in libopenmpt 0.6.7
    was incomplete.
  * ULT: Offset commands exceeding 65535 samples were sometimes not
    imported correctly even if there was room for them.
  * After seeking with seek.sync_samples=1, the filter settings of
    playing notes were not updated since libopenmpt 0.6.7.
  * Loading of and seeking inside (malformed) modules with
    thousands of short sub-songs has been sped up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  4 18:44:20 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.6.8:
  * [Bug] DSYM: Loading DSYM files got broken in 0.6.7.
  * When seeking around in a module, the tempo was sometimes
    incorrectly limited to 255 BPM
  * Initial instrument cutoff was broken for OPL instruments in
    libopenmnpt 0.6.7 
  * mpg123: Update to v1.31.2 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 02:10:42 UTC 2023 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.6.7
  * IT: In sample mode, portamento to a different sample turns off
    the filter if cutoff / resonance was previously 127 / 0.
  * S3M Detect files saved with Graoumf Tracker instead of claiming
    they were made with OpenMPT 4.47.
  * S3M: Pattern loop state was not propagated anymore since
    libopenmpt 0.6.0, leading to wrong song length calculation and
    SB0 + SBx being located on different channels not working
    properly anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 19:37:31 UTC 2022 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.6.6
  * [Sec] Possible crash when playing manipulated IT / MPTM files
    with a T00 command.
  * MTM: In MultiTracker, setting speed and tempo are mutually
    exclusive commands. Still, some MultiTracker modules were made
    to be played with external players such as DMP, so they
    actually rely on “standard” speed / tempo behaviour. Decide
    which behaviour to use by checking of speed and tempo commands
    are found on the same row.
  * MTM: Ignore sample loops if the loop end is <= 2.
  * Echo DMO: Migrate left and right delay values in modules made
    with OpenMPT versions between 1.27.01.00 and 1.30.05.00 to the
    correct interpretation.
- Changes in 0.6.5:
  * [Bug] Makefile now also uses CC, CXX, LD, and AR when set as
    environment variables.
  * [New] Makefile now uses PKG_CONFIG as path to pkg-config.
  * DBM: Sample middle-C frequencies were slightly off.
    laffik_-_marynarze.dbm sounds much more bearable now.
  * DBM: Fixed pattern break parameter interpretation.
  * Echo DMO: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a 2-second
    echo delay instead of 1ms.
  * Digi Booster Echo: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a
    510ms echo delay instead of approximately 334ms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 16:59:32 UTC 2022 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.6.4
  * Fix: Ping-pong sample loops sometimes stopped playing at the
    end of the loop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 16 08:11:38 UTC 2022 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.3:
  * Pitch / Pan Separation and Random Variation instrument properties
    were not resetting properly when seeking, potentially causing
    instruments to be played e.g. at a vastly different pan position
    compared to playing the module continuously.
  * MED: Stereo samples were not imported correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 10:55:08 UTC 2022 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.2:
 *  [**Sec**] Possible out-of-bounds write in malformed IT / XM / MPTM files
    using the internal LFO plugin. (r17076)
 *  [**Sec**] Possible out-of-bounds read when using Amiga BLEP interpolation
    with extremely high-pitched notes. (r17078, r17079)
 *  ISO-8859-1-related charsets from Amiga OS and RISC OS are now handled more
    accurately, thus avoiding some unwanted control characters.
 *  MO3: Pattern indices 254 / 255 were not treated as playable patterns even if
    the original file was a MOD / XM.
 *  Correctly apply ST3-style effect memory when seeking in S3M files.
 *  Command S (S3M / IT style) effect memory was not applied when seeking.
 *  Initial channel mute status was not reported correctly in `get_channel_mute_status`
    since libopenmpt 0.6.0.
- Fix build on Leap by using GCC-11 as charconv header is only included
  from GCC-8 onwards

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 07:22:22 UTC 2022 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.6.1:
  * [Bug] Possible hang with malformed DMF, DSM, MED, MUS, OKT and
    SymMOD files containing 65536 or more patterns when destroying
    the module.
  * [Bug] Avoid NaNs and infinite values with custom tunings and in
    the I3DL2Reverb plugin.
  * MIDI macros are now evaluated when seeking.
  * The letter “z” is now evaluated in fixed MIDI macros (Z80…ZFF)
    the same way as in Impulse Tracker.
  * MOD: Loosened VBlank timing heuristics so that “frame of mind”
    by Dascon plays correctly.
  * MOD: Validate the contents of “hidden” patterns beyond the end
    of the order list when the file size matches the expected size
    when only taken “official” patterns into account. This fixes
    Shofixti Ditty.mod from Star Control 2 while keeping other
    (partly broken) modules working.
  * MED: Command 20 (reverse sample) is now only applied when it’s
    next to a note.
  * S3M: Introducing the “Send OPL key-off when triggering notes”
    compatibility setting broke retrigger for OPL notes again
    (they retriggered rather than not retriggering).
  * S3M: Retriggering a note no longer resets its pitch after a
    portamento.
  * S3M: Partially implement retrigger behaviour for stopped notes
    in SoundBlaster mode: Like in IT, it is not possible to
    retrigger a sample that has already stopped playing.
  * DIGI: Improve compatibility with E3x reverse sample command.
  * DSym: Tempos < 32 were treated as tempo slides.
  * SymMOD: Key-off command was not implemented properly.
- Changes in 0.6.0:
  * [New] MUS files from Psycho Pinball and Micro Machines 2 are
    now supported.
  * [New] SymMOD files created with Symphonie / Symphonie Pro are
    now supported.
  * [New] FMT files created with Davey W Taylor’s FM Tracker are
    now supported.
  * [New] DSYM files created with Digital Symphony are now
    supported.
  * [New] STX files (transitional format between Scream Tracker 2
    and 3) are now supported.
  * [New] TakeTracker MODs with TDZ1 to TDZ3 magic bytes are now
    supported.
  * [New] libopenmpt_ext: New interface interactive2 adding
    openmpt::ext::interactive2::note_off(),
    openmpt::ext::interactive2::note_fade(),
    openmpt::ext::interactive2::set_channel_panning(),
    openmpt::ext::interactive2::get_channel_panning(),
    openmpt::ext::interactive2::set_note_finetune(),
    and openmpt::ext::interactive2::get_note_finetune() (C++)
    and openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.note_off(),
    openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.note_fade(),
    openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.set_channel_panning(),
    openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.get_channel_panning(),
    openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.set_note_finetune(),
    and openmpt_module_ext_interface_interactive2.get_note_finetune() (C).
  * [Change] libopenmpt no longer generates internal interpolation
    tables on library load time, but instead only on first module
    load time.
  * libopenmpt can now detect infinite pattern loops and treats
    them as the song end. This means that setting a repeat count
    other than -1 now always guarantees that playback will
    eventually end. The song loop counter is decremented each time
    it ends up at the start of the infinite loop, so the song does
    not restart from the beginning even if the repeat count is not
    0.
  * openmpt::module::set_position_seconds() accuracy has been
    improved for modules with pattern loops.
  * Samples played at the wrong volume when rendering modules in
    mono.
  * IT: Portamentos in files with Linear Slides disabled are now
    more accurate.
  * IT: Pitch/Pan Separation was affected by note-off commands,
    and wasn’t reset by panning commands like in Impulse Tracker.
  * IT: Even after libopenmpt 0.5.14 the filter reset logic was
    still not 100% identical to Impulse Tracker: A note triggered
    on tick 0 of a row with a Pattern Delay effect still caused the
    filter to be reset on repetitions of that row even though the
    note wasn’t retriggered.
  * IT: Added read-only support for BeRoTracker commands 1 and 2
    (equivalent to XM commands K and L).
  * XM: BeRoTracker saves smooth MIDI macros in a different way
    from OpenMPT. This command is now imported correctly.
  * XM: Emulate FT2 Tone Portamento quirk that inverts portamento
    direction after the target was reached (if target note was
    higher than previous note).
  * S3M files saved with Impulse Tracker and latest Schism Tracker
    now also compute sample playback speed in Hertz.
  * Depending on whether an S3M file was last saved in Scream
    Tracker with the Sound Blaster or Gravis Ultrasound drivers
    loaded, different compatibility flags are now applied. For
    files saved with the GUS, the sample volume factor is now also
    ignored (fixes volume levels in S3Ms made on the GUS,
    in particular if they use both samples and OPL instruments).
  * S3M: Enforce the lower frequency bound.
  * MOD: Loosened VBlank timing heuristics so that the original
    copy of Guitar Slinger from Dizzy Tunes II plays correctly.
  * FAR: Correct portamento depth is now used.
  * DMF / IMF: Improved accuracy of finetune commands.
  * MDL: Implemented finetune command.
  * OKT: Various accuracy improvements such as: Sharing volume
    between mixed channels, volume commands on mixed channels are
    permanent (not reset with new notes), mixed channels do not
    support default sample volume, 7-bit samples are actually
    supposed to be played as-is (not amplified to full 8-bit
    range), reject speed command parameters >= 20.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 23 06:48:17 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.14:
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-bounds read in Chorus plugin with NaN
    plugin parameters. Most implementations of the “fast math”
    compiler optimizations will prevent this crash but it is not
    guaranteed. (r16096)
  * [Bug] Fixed undefined behaviour with custom tunings found with
    ubsan.
  * OPL: Improved channel allocation strategy when there are lots
    of faded-out notes.
  * MOD: Digital Tracker MODs have four unknown bytes right after
    the magic bytes which seem to be ignored even by Digital
    Tracker itself. Just skip over them.
  * The logic when to turn off the resonant filter was broken in
    some edge cases since libopenmpt 0.5.1.
  * IMF: Implemented XE1-XE3 commands, which disable individual
    envelopes. Command Nxy (cutoff slide + resonance) is now also
    partially supported (only resonance for now).
  * IMF: Filter envelopes were upside down.
  * MTM: Omitting pattern loading through the load.skip_patterns
    ctl caused sample data to be corrupted.
  * S3M: Ignore O00 commands in files created with Scream Tracker
    3.00 and 3.01, as this command only gained effect memory in
    version 3.03.
  * STM: Use S3M-like sample swap behaviour.
  * XM: Disable arpeggio quirk for XMs made with Skale Tracker.
    Fixes KAPTENFL.XM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  1 10:26:39 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.13:
  * [Bug] Fixed various undefined behaviour found with ubsan.
  * IMF: Change envelope interpretation to be more like in XM instead of
    IT and tighten header validation.
  * MED: Some samples had a ping-pong loop when there should be no loop at all.
  * MT2: Ignore incorrect drums chunk size in early MT2 files (fixes e.g.
    “A little Rock” by Csumi).
  * MT2: Work around initial master volume of 0 used in some files that apply
    a fade-in a the song start using track automation that would stay silent
    forever otherwise (track automation is currently not supported).
  * OKT: Apply portamento on every tick.
  * mpg123: Update to v1.29.2 (2021-10-23).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 13:02:36 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.12:
  * [Sec] Possible crash when loading malformed MDL files. (r15603)

  * [Bug] Fixed various undefined behaviour found with ubsan.
  * Seeking with sample sync sometimes didn’t compute the correct
    sample position with pingpong-looped samples.
  * IT: Tremor command I11 erroneously behaved like I00 (use previous
    parameter) unless IT Old Effects were enabled.
  * PTM: Panning was translated wrong in some edge cases.
  * IMF / PTM: Note Slide commands were sometimes slightly off.
  * OKT: Better support for fine note slides.
  * DBM: Echo enable effect parameter range checks were incorrect.

  * XM: Sample texts in XMs made with MadTracker are now also
    decoded using Windows-1252 encoding.

  * in_openmpt: Song metadata is no longer reverted when viewing
    file info.
  * mpg123: Update to v1.29.0 (2021-09-06).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 22:18:43 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.11:
  * [Sec] Possible crash with malformed modules when trying to
    access non-existent plugin slots FX251-FX255.
  * [Sec] Possible read beyond sample start after swapping to a
    sample with loop points set but not loop enabled.
  * [Sec] Fixed various possible crashes with malformed MMCMP
    files.
  * [Sec] MED: Possible read past end of sequence name
    (stack-allocated, so relatively unlikely to result in a
    crash).
  * Fixed excessive memory usage with files claiming to have an
    extremely high rows per beat count while also using tempo
    swing. Maximum rows per beat are now limited to 65536.
  * STP: Avoid creating thousands of patterns when loading
    malformed files even though no more pattern data can be read.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 11 08:40:39 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.10:
  * S3M: Honor the Stereo flag not being set. This improves the
    sound of some tunes like Turbulence by Purple Motion.
  * S3M: Detect MPT 1.0 alpha versions which didn’t set the Stereo
    flag. In this case, the unset Stereo flag is also ignored
    because MPT 1.0 alpha used the default S3M channel panning
    anyway.
  * S3M: Only for OPL instruments the high sample rate bits should
    be ignored; for PCM instruments they are clamped to 65535 Hz.
  * MOD: Do not apply ProTracker loop length quirk to MODs that
    could have been made with Scream Tracker (fixes Soul-O-Matic
    by Purple Motion).
  * AMF (DSMI): Format revisions 1 and 9, as well as early
    (technically malformed) revision 10 files, are now supported.
    Surround panning commands and instrument number without note
    are now converted correctly.
  * AMF (DSMI): Patterns and samples were not read correctly in
    some files (e.g. AVOID.AMF).
  * GDM: Correctly import extra-fine portamentos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 23 17:53:40 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.9:
  * The retrigger effect didn’t work correctly for OPL instruments
    in some cases depending on the chosen output sample rate.
  * S3M: Emulate IT short sample retrigger quirk in S3M files saved
    with Impulse Tracker and Schism Tracker.
  * ProTracker 3.6 doesn’t support sample swapping. It is now
    disabled when loading a ProTracker 3.6 IFF module.
  * Some files with “hidden” garbage patterns were not played
    correctly since libopenmpt 0.5.3.
  * MOD: E9x retrigger now works the same way as in ProTracker 2.
  * MDL: Improve auto-vibrato accuracy.
  * 669: Reject files that contain any pattern tempo higher than
    15.
  * Reduce memory consumption of malformed XPK-compressed files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 02:32:33 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.8:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_order_row pointing to an invalid
    pattern, and another openmpt::module::read call. To trigger the
    crash, pattern 0 must not exist in the file and the tick speed
    before the position jump must be lower than the initial speed
    of the module.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt 0.5.7 broke seeking in some subsongs.
  * The built-in LFO plugin did not load the correct initial LFO
    frequency.
  * IT command S7x (instrument control) is now supported when
    seeking with sample sync enabled.
  * libopenmpt_ext play_note was cutting of channels even when
    there were plenty of free channels to use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 20 20:15:48 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.7:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_seconds with a position past the
    song end, and another openmpt::module::read call.

  * IT: Instrument / sample panning was reset on note-off / fade
    commands.
  * IMF: Set Finetune is now implemented correctly.
  * Fixed excessive memory consumption with malformed files in
    various formats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 14 18:40:46 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.6:
  * AMS: Avoid allocating excessive amount of memory for compressed
    song message in malformed files.
  * S3M: Some samples or OPL patches were imported with a too high
    sample rate if module was saved with Scream Tracker 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  2 23:22:53 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.5:
  * [Bug] stb_vorbis: Fix decoding of Vorbis streams without
    comments which affected most Vorbis samples since stb_vorbis
    v1.20.
  * openmpt::ext::interactive::set_pitch_factor wasn’t applied to
    OPL voices.
  * OPL channel state (in particular current patch) is now updated
    when seeking.
  * The FT2 tremolo quirk is now also applied to MOD files.
    FT2 just copied the quirky code from ProTracker!
  * DMF: Preserve effects better in some situations where there is
    more than one effect in a pattern cell.
  * DMF: Improve import of finetune effect with parameters larger
    than +/-15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 16 02:53:46 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.4:
  * AMS: An upper bound for uncompressed sample size is now
    established to avoid memory exhaustion from malformed files.
  * DMF: Support early format beta versions (in particular versions
    1-4).
  * MED: Also use octave wrapping in 8-channel mode for MMD0/MMD1
    modules.
  * MED: If 8-channel mode is activated, ignore BPM mode.
  * MED: Emulate tempo commands F01 and F02 quirk.
  * MED: Tempo commands below 32 BPM were interpreted as tempo
    slides.
  * IMF: Instrument sample mapping was off by one octave, notable
    in the guitar part of Astaris by Karsten Koch.

Changes in 0.5.3:
  * [Sec] Possible hang if a MED file claimed to contain 256 songs.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt: openmpt::is_extension_supported2() exported
    symbol was missing (C++).
  * [Bug] openmpt::module::set_position_seconds sometimes behaved
    as if the song end was reached when seeking into a pattern loop
    and in some other corner cases.
  * Increase threshold for ignoring panning commands from 820 to
    830.
  * Subsong names now fall back to the first pattern’s name if
    empty.
  * MO3: Avoid certain ModPlug hacks from being fixed up twice,
    which could lead to e.g. very narrow pan swing range for old
    OpenMPT IT files saved with a recent MO3 encoder version.
  * MO3: Some files with corrupted envelope data could be rejected
    completely (normally libopenmpt should fix up the envelope
    data).
  * MO3: Song metadata didn’t correctly identify MPTM as source
    format (it appeared as IT instead).
  * STM: Change tempo computation to behave like Scream Tracker 2.3
    instead of Scream Tracker 2.2, as the playback frequencies we
    use for sample playback are closer to those of Scream Tracker
    2.3.
  * PLM: Percentage offset (Mxx) was slightly off.
  * WOW: Fix loading of several files and harden WOW detection.

Changes in 0.5.2:
  * PP20: The first few bytes of some files were not decompressed
    properly, making some files unplayable (depending on the
    original format).

Changes in 0.5.1:
  * [Bug] libopenmpt/libopenmpt.h failed to compile with
    LIBOPENMPT_NO_DEPRECATE defined.
  * MPTM: Qxy now retriggers OPL notes if new compatibility flag is
    set in file.
  * MPTM: Bring back old OPL note end-of-envelope behaviour for
    files made with OpenMPT 1.28.
  * IT: Global volume slides with both nibbles set preferred the
    “slide up” nibble over the “slide down” nibble in old OpenMPT
    versions, unlike other slides. Such old files are now imported
    correctly again.
  * IT: Fixed an edge case where, if the filter hit full
    cutoff / no resonance on the first tick of a row where a new
    delayed note would be triggered, the filter would be disabled
    even though it should stay active. Fixes trace.it by maddie.
  * OXM: Some sample loops were not imported correctly.
  * XM: Out-of-range arpeggio clamping behaviour broke in OpenMPT
    1.23.05.00. The arpeggios in Binary World by Dakota now play
    correctly again.
  * S3M: Support old-style sample pre-amp value in very early
    S3M files.
  * S3M: Only force-enable fast slides for files ST 3.00.
    Previously, any S3M file made with an ST3 version older than
    3.20 enabled them.
  * S3M: Only apply volume and middle-C speed on instrument change
    if the new sample slot has sample data.
  * MOD: Fix an infinite loop in GamerMan by MrGamer by playing
    non-ProTracker MODs more like FT2 would.
  * M15: Improve tracker detection heuristics to never assume
    SoundTracker 2.0 if there is a huge number of Dxx commands,
    as that is a definite hint that they should be treated as
    volume slides. Fixes Monty On The Run by Master Blaster.
  * MO3: Support OPL patches in MO3 files created from MPTM and S3M
  * DBM: If a global pattern command would be lost because both
    effect commands in a cell would have to go into the regular
    effect column (e.g. a speed and a tempo command), the lost
    command is now attempted to be written into a different cell
    on the same row. Fixes “Party-Question V” by grogon.

Sun Jun  7 08:12:02 UTC 2020 - Dave Plater <davejplater@gmail.com>

- Remove devel packages requirement on obsolete modplug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 24 18:39:14 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Drop libmodpulg-pcfile.patch
- Update to 0.5.0:
  * [New] OggMod compressed FastTracker 2 XM (OXM) modules are now
    supported.
  * [New] The emulated Amiga type when Amiga resampler emulation
    is enabled can now be selected via ctl
    render.resampler.emulate_amiga_type.
    Possible values are: "auto", "a500", "a1200",
    and an experimental option "unfiltered".
  * [New] libopenmpt: New API
    openmpt::module::get_current_estimated_bpm() (C++),
    and openmpt_module_get_current_estimated_bpm() (C)
    which provides accurate beats per minute information for
    module formats with time signature and an educated guess
    based on speed and tempo for others.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New type-aware ctl APIs that do not require
    memory allocations and are thus realtime-safe:
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_boolean(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_integer(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_floatingpoint(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_text(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_boolean(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_integer(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_floatingpoint() (C++),
    and openmpt_module_ctl_get_boolean(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_integer(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_floatingpoint(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_text(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_boolean(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_integer(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_floatingpoint() (C).
  * [New] libopenmpt C++ New API
    openmpt::is_extension_supported2() which takes a
    std::string_view parameter instead of std::string.
  * [New] libopenmpt C++: New API
    openmpt::module::module(std::vector<std::byte> data),
    openmpt::module::module(const std::byte * data, std::size_t size),
    openmpt::module::module(const std::byte * beg, const std::byte * end).
  * [New] libopenmpt C++: New API
    openmpt::probe_file_header(flags, const std::byte * data, std::size_t size, filesize),
    openmpt::probe_file_header(flags, const std::byte * data, std::size_t size).
  * [New] libopenmpt_ext C++: New API
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(std::vector<std::byte> data),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(const std::byte * data, std::size_t size),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(std::vector<std::uint8_t> data),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(const std::uint8_t * data, std::size_t size).
  * [Change] std::istream based file I/O has been speed up.
  * [Change] Dependency on iconv on Linux has been removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: The libmodplug emulation layer has
    been removed from the libopenmpt tree. Please use the separate
    libopenmpt-modplug package instead.
  * [Regression] Support for building with C++11 or C++14 has been
    removed. C++17 is now required to build libopenmpt.
  * [Regression] Support for client code using C++11 or C++ 14 has
    been removed. C++17 is now required to build libopenmpt client
    applications.
  * [Regression] Support for GCC 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6 has been removed.
  * [Regression] Support for Clang 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] Support for Emscripten versions older than 1.39.1
    has been removed.
  * [Regression] openmpt123: Support for SDL1 (but not SDL2) output
    has been removed.
  * [Regression] openmpt123: Support for SDL2 older than 2.0.4 has
    been removed.
  * [Regression] It is no longer possible to optionally use iconv
    for character set conversions.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: openmpt123 now honors the current locale and
    outputs text appropriately.
  * Greatly improved MED import. Synthesized instruments are still
    not supported but support was added for: Multisampled
    instruments, delta samples, more pattern commands,
    Hold and Decay, VSTi and MIDI output, multiple songs and
    many other small changes.
  * Improved OPL channel allocation when more than 18 notes are
    active, so that channels that have completely faded out are
    prioritized over channels that have already been released but
    have not faded out yet.
  * Interactively triggering an OPL instrument could cause the
    first pattern channel to no longer be played back correctly.
  * Fix some inaccuracies in OPL emulator.
  * Fix overflow of OPL amplification happening at a synth
    volume level of 510.
  * End-of-sample pop reduction of surround channels was applied
    to front channels instead, causing a pop on the front channels
    instead of removing it on the back channels.
  * IT: Disable retrigger with short notes quirk for modules saved
    with Chibi Tracker, as it does not implement that quirk.
  * IT: Instrument and sample panning should not override channel
    panning for following notes.
  * IT: SBx is now prioritized over Bxx commands that are to the
    left of it.
  * IT: Duplicate Check Type “Sample” should only be applied if
    the instruments match, too.
  * IT: Duplicate Check Type “Note” should compare pattern notes,
    but it was comparing the new pattern note against the old
    translated note.
  * IT: Various fixes for envelope resetting.
  * IT / S3M: When combining SBx and EEx effects, don’t skip the
    first row of the loop like in FastTracker 2.
  * S3M: Empty pattern commands now affect effect memory as well.
  * S3M: Offset beyond loop end wraps around to loop start like in
    Scream Tracker 3 + GUS (previously it just keep playing from
    the loop start, which is neither what GUS nor Sound Blaster
    drivers do).
  * S3M: Notes cannot be retriggered after they have been cut.
  * S3M: Fix portamento after note cut
    (fixes antediluvian_song.s3m).
  * S3M / MOD: Previous note offset is no longer used for
    retriggered notes if there was no instrument number next to
    the Qxy effect.
  * MOD: Sample swapping now also works if the sample that is being
    swapped from does not loop. Swapping to a non-looped sample now
    stops playback once the swapped-from sample reaches its (loop)
    end.
  * MOD: Fix early song ending due to ProTracker pattern jump quirk
    (EEx + Dxx on same row) if infinite looping is disabled.
    Fixes Haunted Tracks.mod by Triace.
  * MOD: Previous note offset is no longer used for retriggered
    notes if there was no instrument number next to the E9x effect.
  * MOD: Vibrato type “ramp down” was upside down.
  * XM: If a file contains patterns longer than 1024 rows,
    they are now clamped to 1024 rows instead of 64 rows.
  * XM: Do not reset note-off status on portamento if there is no
    instrument number.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 13 21:59:44 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.4.12:
  * IT: Vibrato was too fast in Old Effects mode since
    libopenmpt 0.3.
  * XM: Treat 8bitbubsy’s FT2 clone exactly like Fasttracker 2 with
    respect to compatibility and playback flags. For example,
    FT2 Pan Law was not applied.
  * DMF: Some files had a wrong tempo since
    libopenmpt 0.2.5705-beta15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 16:04:28 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.4.11:
  * The “date” metadata could contain a bogus date for some older IT files.
  * Do not apply global volume ramping from initial global volume when seeking.
  * MTM: Sample loop length was off by one.
  * PSM: Sample loop length was off by one in most files.
  * MOD: Fix initial instrument change with no note playing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  3 00:56:00 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.9 bsc#1153102 CVE-2019-17113
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C API: Limit the length of strings copied to
    the output buffer of ModPlug_InstrumentName() and
    ModPlug_SampleName() to 32 bytes (including terminating null)
    as is done by original libmodplug. This avoids potential buffer
    overflows in software relying on this limit instead of querying
    the required buffer size beforehand. libopenmpt can return
    strings longer than 32 bytes here beacuse the internal limit of
    32 bytes applies to strings encoded in arbitrary character
    encodings but the API returns them converted to UTF-8, which
    can be longer. (reported by Antonio Morales Maldonado of Semmle
    Security Research Team) (r12129)
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C++ API: Do not return 0 in
    CSoundFile::GetSampleName() and CSoundFile::GetInstrumentName()
    when a null output pointer is provided. This behaviour differed
    from libmodplug and made it impossible to determine the
    required buffer size. (r12130)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  1 00:21:48 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to out-of-bounds read when playing an
    OPL note with active filter in S3M or MPTM files (r12118).
- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * J2B: Ignore notes with non-existing instrument
    (fixes Ending.j2b)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 11 02:01:11 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.6:
  * Detect IT files unpacked with early UNMO3 versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 10:30:08 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.5:
  * [Sec] Possible crash during playback due out-of-bounds read in
    XM and MT2 files
  * Breaking out of a sustain loop through Note-Off sometimes
    didn’t continue in the regular sample loop
  * Seeking did not stop notes playing with XM Key Off (Kxx) effect

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 15:29:38 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  * [Bug] Channel VU meters were swapped.
  * Startrekker: Clamp speed to 31 ticks per row.
  * MTM: Ignore unused Exy commands on import.
    Command E5x (Set Finetune) is now applied correctly.
  * MOD: Sample swapping was always enabled since it has been
    separated from the ProTracker 1/2 compatibility flag. Now it is
    always enabled for Amiga-style modules and otherwise the old
    heuristic is used again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 11 11:05:01 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to null-pointer access when doing a
    portamento from an OPL instrument to an empty instrument note
    map slot.
  * IT: Various fixes for note-off + instrument number in
    Old Effects mode.
  * MO3: Import IT row highlights as written by MO3 2.4.1.2 or
    newer. Required for modules using modern tempo mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 18:17:07 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.2 bsc#1143582 CVE-2019-14382 bsc#1143584
  CVE-2019-14383:
  * [Sec] DSM: Assertion failure during file parsing with debug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 19:08:40 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Public symbols of the C++ API had
    visibility=hidden set on non-MSVC systems, which made them not
    publicly accessible.
  * MO3: Apply playback changes based on “ModPlug-made” header flag
- Drop libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  1 10:36:58 UTC 2019 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 23 16:35:59 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.0 bsc#1143581 CVE-2018-20860:
  * [New] libopenmpt now includes emulation of the OPL chip and
    thus plays OPL instruments in S3M, C67 and MPTM files.
    OPL chip emulation volume can be changed with the new ctl
    render.opl.volume_factor.
  * [New] libopenmpt now supports CDFM / Composer 670 module files.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New ctl play.at_end can be used to change
    what happens when the song end is reached:
    - “fadeout”: Fades the module out for a short while.
      Subsequent reads after the fadeout will return 0 rendered
      frames. This is the default and identical to the behaviour
      in previous libopenmpt versions.
    - “continue”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will continue playing from the song
      start or loop start. This can be used for custom loop logic,
      such as loop auto-detection and longer fadeouts.
    - “stop”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will return 0 rendered frames.
  * [New] Add new metadata fields "originaltype" and
    "originaltype_long" which allow more clearly reflecting what
    is going on with converted formats like MO3 and GDM.
  * [Change] openmpt123: openmpt123 now rejects --output-type in
    --ui and --batch modes and also rejects --output in --render
    mode. These combinations of options really made no sense and
    were rather confusing.
  * [Regression] Support for libmpg123 older than 1.14.0 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: Support for emulating libmodplug
    0.8.7 API/ABI has been removed.
  * [Bug] xmp-openmpt: Sample rate and number of output channels
    were not applied correctly when using per-file settings.
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Prevent libsdl2 and libsdl from being enabled
    at the same time because they conflict with each other.
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour
  * IT: In Compatible Gxx mode, allow sample changes next to a tone
    portamento effect if a previous sample has already stopped
    playing.
  * IT: Fix broken volume envelopes with negative values as found
    in breakdwn.it by Elysis.
  * MOD: Slides and delayed notes are executed on every repetition
    of a row with row delay (fixes “ode to protracker”).
  * XM: If the sustain point of the panning envelope is reached
    before key-off, it is never released.
  * XM: Do not default recall volume / panning for delayed
    instrument-less notes
  * XM :E60 loop bug was not considered in song length calucation.
  * S3M: Notes without instrument number use previous note’s sample
    offset.
  * Tighten M15 and MOD file rejection heuristics.
  * J2B: Ignore frequency limits from file header.
    Fixes Medivo.j2b, broken since libopenmpt-0.2.6401-beta17.
  * STM: More accurate tempo calculation.
  * STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files
    have been found in the wild, though).
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * SFX: Work around bad conversions of the “Operation Stealth”
    soundtrack by turning pattern breaks into note stops.
  * IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down and the cutoff range was
    too small.
  * ParamEq plugin center frequency was not limited correctly.
  * Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
  * The “note cut” duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
    previously playing sample.
  * A song starting with non-existing patterns could not be played.
  * DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
  * DTM: Import global volume.
  * MOD: Support notes in octave 2, like in FastTracker 2
    (fixes DOPE.MOD).
  * Do not apply Amiga playback heuristics to MOD files that have
    clearly been written with a PC tracker.
  * MPTM: More logical release node behaviour.
  * Subsong search is now less thorough. It could previously find
    many subsongs that are technically correct (unplayed rows at
    the beginning of patterns that have been jumped over due to
    pattern breaks), but so far no real-world module that would
    require such a thorough subsong detection was found. The old
    mechanism caused way more false positives than intended with
    real-world modules, though.
  * Restrict the unpacked size of compressed DMF, IT, MDL and MO3
    samples to avoid huge allocations with malformed small files.

- Update to version 0.3.13:
  * [Sec] Crash with malformed MED files.
  * Transposed samples in AMF ASYLUM modules were not played
    correctly.
  * Notes triggered by libopenmpt_ext play_note could be played
    with a panbrello effect if the same virtual channel was
    previously used with panbrello.
  * Clicks when stopping channels that didn’t end at zero volume.
  * XM: Do not import non-standard commands N and M as channel
    volume commands.

    neighbour.
  * libopenmpt now compiles without warnings with GCC 8.
  * Jump commands on the same row as the end of a pattern loop
    covering the restart position of the module could cause the
    module to loop even when looping was disabled.
  * MO3: Reject overly long MP3 and Vorbis samples.
  * play_note from the libopenmpt_ext interface sometimes silenced
    the start of a triggered sample.
