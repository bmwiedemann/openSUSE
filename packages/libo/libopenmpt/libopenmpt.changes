Mon Apr 13 21:59:44 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.4.12:
  * IT: Vibrato was too fast in Old Effects mode since
    libopenmpt 0.3.
  * XM: Treat 8bitbubsy’s FT2 clone exactly like Fasttracker 2 with
    respect to compatibility and playback flags. For example,
    FT2 Pan Law was not applied.
  * DMF: Some files had a wrong tempo since
    libopenmpt 0.2.5705-beta15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 16:04:28 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.4.11:
  * The “date” metadata could contain a bogus date for some older IT files.
  * Do not apply global volume ramping from initial global volume when seeking.
  * MTM: Sample loop length was off by one.
  * PSM: Sample loop length was off by one in most files.
  * MOD: Fix initial instrument change with no note playing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  3 00:56:00 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.9 bsc#1153102 CVE-2019-17113
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C API: Limit the length of strings copied to
    the output buffer of ModPlug_InstrumentName() and
    ModPlug_SampleName() to 32 bytes (including terminating null)
    as is done by original libmodplug. This avoids potential buffer
    overflows in software relying on this limit instead of querying
    the required buffer size beforehand. libopenmpt can return
    strings longer than 32 bytes here beacuse the internal limit of
    32 bytes applies to strings encoded in arbitrary character
    encodings but the API returns them converted to UTF-8, which
    can be longer. (reported by Antonio Morales Maldonado of Semmle
    Security Research Team) (r12129)
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C++ API: Do not return 0 in
    CSoundFile::GetSampleName() and CSoundFile::GetInstrumentName()
    when a null output pointer is provided. This behaviour differed
    from libmodplug and made it impossible to determine the
    required buffer size. (r12130)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  1 00:21:48 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to out-of-bounds read when playing an
    OPL note with active filter in S3M or MPTM files (r12118).
- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * J2B: Ignore notes with non-existing instrument
    (fixes Ending.j2b)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 11 02:01:11 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.6:
  * Detect IT files unpacked with early UNMO3 versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 10:30:08 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.5:
  * [Sec] Possible crash during playback due out-of-bounds read in
    XM and MT2 files
  * Breaking out of a sustain loop through Note-Off sometimes
    didn’t continue in the regular sample loop
  * Seeking did not stop notes playing with XM Key Off (Kxx) effect

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 15:29:38 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  * [Bug] Channel VU meters were swapped.
  * Startrekker: Clamp speed to 31 ticks per row.
  * MTM: Ignore unused Exy commands on import.
    Command E5x (Set Finetune) is now applied correctly.
  * MOD: Sample swapping was always enabled since it has been
    separated from the ProTracker 1/2 compatibility flag. Now it is
    always enabled for Amiga-style modules and otherwise the old
    heuristic is used again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 11 11:05:01 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to null-pointer access when doing a
    portamento from an OPL instrument to an empty instrument note
    map slot.
  * IT: Various fixes for note-off + instrument number in
    Old Effects mode.
  * MO3: Import IT row highlights as written by MO3 2.4.1.2 or
    newer. Required for modules using modern tempo mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 18:17:07 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.2 bsc#1143582 CVE-2019-14382 bsc#1143584
  CVE-2019-14383:
  * [Sec] DSM: Assertion failure during file parsing with debug
    STLs.
  * [Sec] J2B: Assertion failure during file parsing with debug
    STLs.
  * S3M: Allow volume change of OPL instruments after Note Cut.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 19:08:40 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Public symbols of the C++ API had
    visibility=hidden set on non-MSVC systems, which made them not
    publicly accessible.
  * MO3: Apply playback changes based on “ModPlug-made” header flag
- Drop libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  1 10:36:58 UTC 2019 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

  CSoundFile compat API (bug #1180).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 23 16:35:59 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.0 bsc#1143581 CVE-2018-20860:
  * [New] libopenmpt now includes emulation of the OPL chip and
    thus plays OPL instruments in S3M, C67 and MPTM files.
    OPL chip emulation volume can be changed with the new ctl
    render.opl.volume_factor.
  * [New] libopenmpt now supports CDFM / Composer 670 module files.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New ctl play.at_end can be used to change
    what happens when the song end is reached:
    - “fadeout”: Fades the module out for a short while.
      Subsequent reads after the fadeout will return 0 rendered
      frames. This is the default and identical to the behaviour
      in previous libopenmpt versions.
    - “continue”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will continue playing from the song
      start or loop start. This can be used for custom loop logic,
      such as loop auto-detection and longer fadeouts.
    - “stop”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will return 0 rendered frames.
  * [New] Add new metadata fields "originaltype" and
    "originaltype_long" which allow more clearly reflecting what
    is going on with converted formats like MO3 and GDM.
  * [Change] openmpt123: openmpt123 now rejects --output-type in
    --ui and --batch modes and also rejects --output in --render
    mode. These combinations of options really made no sense and
    were rather confusing.
  * [Regression] Support for libmpg123 older than 1.14.0 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: Support for emulating libmodplug
    0.8.7 API/ABI has been removed.
  * [Bug] xmp-openmpt: Sample rate and number of output channels
    were not applied correctly when using per-file settings.
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Prevent libsdl2 and libsdl from being enabled
    at the same time because they conflict with each other.
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour
  * IT: In Compatible Gxx mode, allow sample changes next to a tone
    portamento effect if a previous sample has already stopped
    playing.
  * IT: Fix broken volume envelopes with negative values as found
    in breakdwn.it by Elysis.
  * MOD: Slides and delayed notes are executed on every repetition
    of a row with row delay (fixes “ode to protracker”).
  * XM: If the sustain point of the panning envelope is reached
    before key-off, it is never released.
  * XM: Do not default recall volume / panning for delayed
    instrument-less notes
  * XM :E60 loop bug was not considered in song length calucation.
  * S3M: Notes without instrument number use previous note’s sample
    offset.
  * Tighten M15 and MOD file rejection heuristics.
  * J2B: Ignore frequency limits from file header.
    Fixes Medivo.j2b, broken since libopenmpt-0.2.6401-beta17.
  * STM: More accurate tempo calculation.
  * STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files
    have been found in the wild, though).
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * SFX: Work around bad conversions of the “Operation Stealth”
    soundtrack by turning pattern breaks into note stops.
  * IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down and the cutoff range was
    too small.
  * ParamEq plugin center frequency was not limited correctly.
  * Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
  * The “note cut” duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
    previously playing sample.
  * A song starting with non-existing patterns could not be played.
  * DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
  * DTM: Import global volume.
  * MOD: Support notes in octave 2, like in FastTracker 2
    (fixes DOPE.MOD).
  * Do not apply Amiga playback heuristics to MOD files that have
    clearly been written with a PC tracker.
  * MPTM: More logical release node behaviour.
  * Subsong search is now less thorough. It could previously find
    many subsongs that are technically correct (unplayed rows at
    the beginning of patterns that have been jumped over due to
    pattern breaks), but so far no real-world module that would
    require such a thorough subsong detection was found. The old
    mechanism caused way more false positives than intended with
    real-world modules, though.
  * Restrict the unpacked size of compressed DMF, IT, MDL and MO3
    samples to avoid huge allocations with malformed small files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 22 20:27:59 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.3.13:
  * [Sec] Crash with malformed MED files.
  * Transposed samples in AMF ASYLUM modules were not played
    correctly.
  * Notes triggered by libopenmpt_ext play_note could be played
    with a panbrello effect if the same virtual channel was
    previously used with panbrello.
  * Clicks when stopping channels that didn’t end at zero volume.
  * XM: Do not import non-standard commands N and M as channel
    volume commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 24 20:13:26 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 0.3.12:
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour.
  * libopenmpt now compiles without warnings with GCC 8.
  * Jump commands on the same row as the end of a pattern loop
    covering the restart position of the module could cause the
    module to loop even when looping was disabled.
  * MO3: Reject overly long MP3 and Vorbis samples.
  * play_note from the libopenmpt_ext interface sometimes silenced
    the start of a triggered sample.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 28 13:36:32 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

  * [Sec] Crash with some malformed custom tunings in MPTM files
  * Channels whose volume envelope was playing at volume 0 while
    being moved to a NNA background channel were cut off completely
    since libopenmpt 0.3.8.
  * AMF (ASYLUM): Convert 7-bit panning to 8-bit panning for
    playback
- Update to version 0.3.10:
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] AMF: Undefined behaviour in loader code could lead to
    files playing silent.
  * Switching between instruments with portamento did not update
    the NNA settings for the new instrument.
  * FAR: Properly import volume commands.
  * [Sec] Possible write near address 0 in out-of-memory situations
    when reading AMS files.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Fixed build failure in C++17 due to use of
    removed feature std::random_shuffle.
  * STM: Having both Bxx and Cxx commands in a pattern imported the
    Bxx command incorrectly.
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * Speed up reading of truncated ULT files.
  * ULT: Portamento import was sometimes broken.
  * The resonant filter was sometimes unstable when combining
    low-volume samples, low cutoff and high mixing rates.
