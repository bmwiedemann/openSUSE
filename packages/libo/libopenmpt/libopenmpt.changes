Fri Oct 22 13:02:36 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.12:
  * [Sec] Possible crash when loading malformed MDL files. (r15603)

  * [Bug] Fixed various undefined behaviour found with ubsan.
  * Seeking with sample sync sometimes didn’t compute the correct
    sample position with pingpong-looped samples.
  * IT: Tremor command I11 erroneously behaved like I00 (use previous
    parameter) unless IT Old Effects were enabled.
  * PTM: Panning was translated wrong in some edge cases.
  * IMF / PTM: Note Slide commands were sometimes slightly off.
  * OKT: Better support for fine note slides.
  * DBM: Echo enable effect parameter range checks were incorrect.

  * XM: Sample texts in XMs made with MadTracker are now also
    decoded using Windows-1252 encoding.

  * in_openmpt: Song metadata is no longer reverted when viewing
    file info.
  * mpg123: Update to v1.29.0 (2021-09-06).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 22:18:43 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.11:
  * [Sec] Possible crash with malformed modules when trying to
    access non-existent plugin slots FX251-FX255.
  * [Sec] Possible read beyond sample start after swapping to a
    sample with loop points set but not loop enabled.
  * [Sec] Fixed various possible crashes with malformed MMCMP
    files.
  * [Sec] MED: Possible read past end of sequence name
    (stack-allocated, so relatively unlikely to result in a
    crash).
  * Fixed excessive memory usage with files claiming to have an
    extremely high rows per beat count while also using tempo
    swing. Maximum rows per beat are now limited to 65536.
  * STP: Avoid creating thousands of patterns when loading
    malformed files even though no more pattern data can be read.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 11 08:40:39 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.10:
  * S3M: Honor the Stereo flag not being set. This improves the
    sound of some tunes like Turbulence by Purple Motion.
  * S3M: Detect MPT 1.0 alpha versions which didn’t set the Stereo
    flag. In this case, the unset Stereo flag is also ignored
    because MPT 1.0 alpha used the default S3M channel panning
    anyway.
  * S3M: Only for OPL instruments the high sample rate bits should
    be ignored; for PCM instruments they are clamped to 65535 Hz.
  * MOD: Do not apply ProTracker loop length quirk to MODs that
    could have been made with Scream Tracker (fixes Soul-O-Matic
    by Purple Motion).
  * AMF (DSMI): Format revisions 1 and 9, as well as early
    (technically malformed) revision 10 files, are now supported.
    Surround panning commands and instrument number without note
    are now converted correctly.
  * AMF (DSMI): Patterns and samples were not read correctly in
    some files (e.g. AVOID.AMF).
  * GDM: Correctly import extra-fine portamentos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 23 17:53:40 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.9:
  * The retrigger effect didn’t work correctly for OPL instruments
    in some cases depending on the chosen output sample rate.
  * S3M: Emulate IT short sample retrigger quirk in S3M files saved
    with Impulse Tracker and Schism Tracker.
  * ProTracker 3.6 doesn’t support sample swapping. It is now
    disabled when loading a ProTracker 3.6 IFF module.
  * Some files with “hidden” garbage patterns were not played
    correctly since libopenmpt 0.5.3.
  * MOD: E9x retrigger now works the same way as in ProTracker 2.
  * MDL: Improve auto-vibrato accuracy.
  * 669: Reject files that contain any pattern tempo higher than
    15.
  * Reduce memory consumption of malformed XPK-compressed files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 02:32:33 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.8:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_order_row pointing to an invalid
    pattern, and another openmpt::module::read call. To trigger the
    crash, pattern 0 must not exist in the file and the tick speed
    before the position jump must be lower than the initial speed
    of the module.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt 0.5.7 broke seeking in some subsongs.
  * The built-in LFO plugin did not load the correct initial LFO
    frequency.
  * IT command S7x (instrument control) is now supported when
    seeking with sample sync enabled.
  * libopenmpt_ext play_note was cutting of channels even when
    there were plenty of free channels to use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 20 20:15:48 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.7:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_seconds with a position past the
    song end, and another openmpt::module::read call.

  * IT: Instrument / sample panning was reset on note-off / fade
    commands.
  * IMF: Set Finetune is now implemented correctly.
  * Fixed excessive memory consumption with malformed files in
    various formats.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 14 18:40:46 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.6:
  * AMS: Avoid allocating excessive amount of memory for compressed
    song message in malformed files.
  * S3M: Some samples or OPL patches were imported with a too high
    sample rate if module was saved with Scream Tracker 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  2 23:22:53 UTC 2021 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.5:
  * [Bug] stb_vorbis: Fix decoding of Vorbis streams without
    comments which affected most Vorbis samples since stb_vorbis
    v1.20.
  * openmpt::ext::interactive::set_pitch_factor wasn’t applied to
    OPL voices.
  * OPL channel state (in particular current patch) is now updated
    when seeking.
  * The FT2 tremolo quirk is now also applied to MOD files.
    FT2 just copied the quirky code from ProTracker!
  * DMF: Preserve effects better in some situations where there is
    more than one effect in a pattern cell.
  * DMF: Improve import of finetune effect with parameters larger
    than +/-15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 16 02:53:46 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.5.4:
  * AMS: An upper bound for uncompressed sample size is now
    established to avoid memory exhaustion from malformed files.
  * DMF: Support early format beta versions (in particular versions
    1-4).
  * MED: Also use octave wrapping in 8-channel mode for MMD0/MMD1
    modules.
  * MED: If 8-channel mode is activated, ignore BPM mode.
  * MED: Emulate tempo commands F01 and F02 quirk.
  * MED: Tempo commands below 32 BPM were interpreted as tempo
    slides.
  * IMF: Instrument sample mapping was off by one octave, notable
    in the guitar part of Astaris by Karsten Koch.

Changes in 0.5.3:
  * [Sec] Possible hang if a MED file claimed to contain 256 songs.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt: openmpt::is_extension_supported2() exported
    symbol was missing (C++).
  * [Bug] openmpt::module::set_position_seconds sometimes behaved
    as if the song end was reached when seeking into a pattern loop
    and in some other corner cases.
  * Increase threshold for ignoring panning commands from 820 to
    830.
  * Subsong names now fall back to the first pattern’s name if
    empty.
  * MO3: Avoid certain ModPlug hacks from being fixed up twice,
    which could lead to e.g. very narrow pan swing range for old
    OpenMPT IT files saved with a recent MO3 encoder version.
  * MO3: Some files with corrupted envelope data could be rejected
    completely (normally libopenmpt should fix up the envelope
    data).
  * MO3: Song metadata didn’t correctly identify MPTM as source
    format (it appeared as IT instead).
  * STM: Change tempo computation to behave like Scream Tracker 2.3
    instead of Scream Tracker 2.2, as the playback frequencies we
    use for sample playback are closer to those of Scream Tracker
    2.3.
  * PLM: Percentage offset (Mxx) was slightly off.
  * WOW: Fix loading of several files and harden WOW detection.

Changes in 0.5.2:
  * PP20: The first few bytes of some files were not decompressed
    properly, making some files unplayable (depending on the
    original format).

Changes in 0.5.1:
  * [Bug] libopenmpt/libopenmpt.h failed to compile with
    LIBOPENMPT_NO_DEPRECATE defined.
  * MPTM: Qxy now retriggers OPL notes if new compatibility flag is
    set in file.
  * MPTM: Bring back old OPL note end-of-envelope behaviour for
    files made with OpenMPT 1.28.
  * IT: Global volume slides with both nibbles set preferred the
    “slide up” nibble over the “slide down” nibble in old OpenMPT
    versions, unlike other slides. Such old files are now imported
    correctly again.
  * IT: Fixed an edge case where, if the filter hit full
    cutoff / no resonance on the first tick of a row where a new
    delayed note would be triggered, the filter would be disabled
    even though it should stay active. Fixes trace.it by maddie.
  * OXM: Some sample loops were not imported correctly.
  * XM: Out-of-range arpeggio clamping behaviour broke in OpenMPT
    1.23.05.00. The arpeggios in Binary World by Dakota now play
    correctly again.
  * S3M: Support old-style sample pre-amp value in very early
    S3M files.
  * S3M: Only force-enable fast slides for files ST 3.00.
    Previously, any S3M file made with an ST3 version older than
    3.20 enabled them.
  * S3M: Only apply volume and middle-C speed on instrument change
    if the new sample slot has sample data.
  * MOD: Fix an infinite loop in GamerMan by MrGamer by playing
    non-ProTracker MODs more like FT2 would.
  * M15: Improve tracker detection heuristics to never assume
    SoundTracker 2.0 if there is a huge number of Dxx commands,
    as that is a definite hint that they should be treated as
    volume slides. Fixes Monty On The Run by Master Blaster.
  * MO3: Support OPL patches in MO3 files created from MPTM and S3M
  * DBM: If a global pattern command would be lost because both
    effect commands in a cell would have to go into the regular
    effect column (e.g. a speed and a tempo command), the lost
    command is now attempted to be written into a different cell
    on the same row. Fixes “Party-Question V” by grogon.

Sun Jun  7 08:12:02 UTC 2020 - Dave Plater <davejplater@gmail.com>

- Remove devel packages requirement on obsolete modplug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 24 18:39:14 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Drop libmodpulg-pcfile.patch
- Update to 0.5.0:
  * [New] OggMod compressed FastTracker 2 XM (OXM) modules are now
    supported.
  * [New] The emulated Amiga type when Amiga resampler emulation
    is enabled can now be selected via ctl
    render.resampler.emulate_amiga_type.
    Possible values are: "auto", "a500", "a1200",
    and an experimental option "unfiltered".
  * [New] libopenmpt: New API
    openmpt::module::get_current_estimated_bpm() (C++),
    and openmpt_module_get_current_estimated_bpm() (C)
    which provides accurate beats per minute information for
    module formats with time signature and an educated guess
    based on speed and tempo for others.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New type-aware ctl APIs that do not require
    memory allocations and are thus realtime-safe:
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_boolean(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_integer(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_floatingpoint(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_get_text(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_boolean(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_integer(),
    openmpt::module::ctl_set_floatingpoint() (C++),
    and openmpt_module_ctl_get_boolean(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_integer(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_floatingpoint(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_get_text(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_boolean(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_integer(),
    openmpt_module_ctl_set_floatingpoint() (C).
  * [New] libopenmpt C++ New API
    openmpt::is_extension_supported2() which takes a
    std::string_view parameter instead of std::string.
  * [New] libopenmpt C++: New API
    openmpt::module::module(std::vector<std::byte> data),
    openmpt::module::module(const std::byte * data, std::size_t size),
    openmpt::module::module(const std::byte * beg, const std::byte * end).
  * [New] libopenmpt C++: New API
    openmpt::probe_file_header(flags, const std::byte * data, std::size_t size, filesize),
    openmpt::probe_file_header(flags, const std::byte * data, std::size_t size).
  * [New] libopenmpt_ext C++: New API
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(std::vector<std::byte> data),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(const std::byte * data, std::size_t size),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(std::vector<std::uint8_t> data),
    openmpt::module_ext::module_ext(const std::uint8_t * data, std::size_t size).
  * [Change] std::istream based file I/O has been speed up.
  * [Change] Dependency on iconv on Linux has been removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: The libmodplug emulation layer has
    been removed from the libopenmpt tree. Please use the separate
    libopenmpt-modplug package instead.
  * [Regression] Support for building with C++11 or C++14 has been
    removed. C++17 is now required to build libopenmpt.
  * [Regression] Support for client code using C++11 or C++ 14 has
    been removed. C++17 is now required to build libopenmpt client
    applications.
  * [Regression] Support for GCC 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6 has been removed.
  * [Regression] Support for Clang 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] Support for Emscripten versions older than 1.39.1
    has been removed.
  * [Regression] openmpt123: Support for SDL1 (but not SDL2) output
    has been removed.
  * [Regression] openmpt123: Support for SDL2 older than 2.0.4 has
    been removed.
  * [Regression] It is no longer possible to optionally use iconv
    for character set conversions.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: openmpt123 now honors the current locale and
    outputs text appropriately.
  * Greatly improved MED import. Synthesized instruments are still
    not supported but support was added for: Multisampled
    instruments, delta samples, more pattern commands,
    Hold and Decay, VSTi and MIDI output, multiple songs and
    many other small changes.
  * Improved OPL channel allocation when more than 18 notes are
    active, so that channels that have completely faded out are
    prioritized over channels that have already been released but
    have not faded out yet.
  * Interactively triggering an OPL instrument could cause the
    first pattern channel to no longer be played back correctly.
  * Fix some inaccuracies in OPL emulator.
  * Fix overflow of OPL amplification happening at a synth
    volume level of 510.
  * End-of-sample pop reduction of surround channels was applied
    to front channels instead, causing a pop on the front channels
    instead of removing it on the back channels.
  * IT: Disable retrigger with short notes quirk for modules saved
    with Chibi Tracker, as it does not implement that quirk.
  * IT: Instrument and sample panning should not override channel
    panning for following notes.
  * IT: SBx is now prioritized over Bxx commands that are to the
    left of it.
  * IT: Duplicate Check Type “Sample” should only be applied if
    the instruments match, too.
  * IT: Duplicate Check Type “Note” should compare pattern notes,
    but it was comparing the new pattern note against the old
    translated note.
  * IT: Various fixes for envelope resetting.
  * IT / S3M: When combining SBx and EEx effects, don’t skip the
    first row of the loop like in FastTracker 2.
  * S3M: Empty pattern commands now affect effect memory as well.
  * S3M: Offset beyond loop end wraps around to loop start like in
    Scream Tracker 3 + GUS (previously it just keep playing from
    the loop start, which is neither what GUS nor Sound Blaster
    drivers do).
  * S3M: Notes cannot be retriggered after they have been cut.
  * S3M: Fix portamento after note cut
    (fixes antediluvian_song.s3m).
  * S3M / MOD: Previous note offset is no longer used for
    retriggered notes if there was no instrument number next to
    the Qxy effect.
  * MOD: Sample swapping now also works if the sample that is being
    swapped from does not loop. Swapping to a non-looped sample now
    stops playback once the swapped-from sample reaches its (loop)
    end.
  * MOD: Fix early song ending due to ProTracker pattern jump quirk
    (EEx + Dxx on same row) if infinite looping is disabled.
    Fixes Haunted Tracks.mod by Triace.
  * MOD: Previous note offset is no longer used for retriggered
    notes if there was no instrument number next to the E9x effect.
  * MOD: Vibrato type “ramp down” was upside down.
  * XM: If a file contains patterns longer than 1024 rows,
    they are now clamped to 1024 rows instead of 64 rows.
  * XM: Do not reset note-off status on portamento if there is no
    instrument number.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 13 21:59:44 UTC 2020 - Mia Herkt <mia@0x0.st>

- Update to 0.4.12:
  * IT: Vibrato was too fast in Old Effects mode since
    libopenmpt 0.3.
  * XM: Treat 8bitbubsy’s FT2 clone exactly like Fasttracker 2 with
    respect to compatibility and playback flags. For example,
    FT2 Pan Law was not applied.
  * DMF: Some files had a wrong tempo since
    libopenmpt 0.2.5705-beta15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 30 16:04:28 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 0.4.11:
  * The “date” metadata could contain a bogus date for some older IT files.
  * Do not apply global volume ramping from initial global volume when seeking.
  * MTM: Sample loop length was off by one.
  * PSM: Sample loop length was off by one in most files.
  * MOD: Fix initial instrument change with no note playing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  3 00:56:00 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.9 bsc#1153102 CVE-2019-17113
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C API: Limit the length of strings copied to
    the output buffer of ModPlug_InstrumentName() and
    ModPlug_SampleName() to 32 bytes (including terminating null)
    as is done by original libmodplug. This avoids potential buffer
    overflows in software relying on this limit instead of querying
    the required buffer size beforehand. libopenmpt can return
    strings longer than 32 bytes here beacuse the internal limit of
    32 bytes applies to strings encoded in arbitrary character
    encodings but the API returns them converted to UTF-8, which
    can be longer. (reported by Antonio Morales Maldonado of Semmle
    Security Research Team) (r12129)
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C++ API: Do not return 0 in
    CSoundFile::GetSampleName() and CSoundFile::GetInstrumentName()
    when a null output pointer is provided. This behaviour differed
    from libmodplug and made it impossible to determine the
    required buffer size. (r12130)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  1 00:21:48 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to out-of-bounds read when playing an
    OPL note with active filter in S3M or MPTM files (r12118).
- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * J2B: Ignore notes with non-existing instrument
    (fixes Ending.j2b)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 11 02:01:11 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.6:
  * Detect IT files unpacked with early UNMO3 versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 10:30:08 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.5:
  * [Sec] Possible crash during playback due out-of-bounds read in
    XM and MT2 files
  * Breaking out of a sustain loop through Note-Off sometimes
    didn’t continue in the regular sample loop
  * Seeking did not stop notes playing with XM Key Off (Kxx) effect

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  7 15:29:38 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  * [Bug] Channel VU meters were swapped.
  * Startrekker: Clamp speed to 31 ticks per row.
  * MTM: Ignore unused Exy commands on import.
    Command E5x (Set Finetune) is now applied correctly.
  * MOD: Sample swapping was always enabled since it has been
    separated from the ProTracker 1/2 compatibility flag. Now it is
    always enabled for Amiga-style modules and otherwise the old
    heuristic is used again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 11 11:05:01 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to null-pointer access when doing a
    portamento from an OPL instrument to an empty instrument note
    map slot.
  * IT: Various fixes for note-off + instrument number in
    Old Effects mode.
  * MO3: Import IT row highlights as written by MO3 2.4.1.2 or
    newer. Required for modules using modern tempo mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 18:17:07 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.2 bsc#1143582 CVE-2019-14382 bsc#1143584
  CVE-2019-14383:
  * [Sec] DSM: Assertion failure during file parsing with debug
    STLs.
  * [Sec] J2B: Assertion failure during file parsing with debug
    STLs.
  * S3M: Allow volume change of OPL instruments after Note Cut.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 19:08:40 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Public symbols of the C++ API had
    visibility=hidden set on non-MSVC systems, which made them not
    publicly accessible.
  * MO3: Apply playback changes based on “ModPlug-made” header flag
- Drop libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  1 10:36:58 UTC 2019 - antoine.belvire@opensuse.org

- Add libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch: Add missing
  CSoundFile compat API (bug #1180).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 23 16:35:59 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.4.0 bsc#1143581 CVE-2018-20860:
  * [New] libopenmpt now includes emulation of the OPL chip and
    thus plays OPL instruments in S3M, C67 and MPTM files.
    OPL chip emulation volume can be changed with the new ctl
    render.opl.volume_factor.
  * [New] libopenmpt now supports CDFM / Composer 670 module files.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New ctl play.at_end can be used to change
    what happens when the song end is reached:
    - “fadeout”: Fades the module out for a short while.
      Subsequent reads after the fadeout will return 0 rendered
      frames. This is the default and identical to the behaviour
      in previous libopenmpt versions.
    - “continue”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will continue playing from the song
      start or loop start. This can be used for custom loop logic,
      such as loop auto-detection and longer fadeouts.
    - “stop”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will return 0 rendered frames.
  * [New] Add new metadata fields "originaltype" and
    "originaltype_long" which allow more clearly reflecting what
    is going on with converted formats like MO3 and GDM.
  * [Change] openmpt123: openmpt123 now rejects --output-type in
    --ui and --batch modes and also rejects --output in --render
    mode. These combinations of options really made no sense and
    were rather confusing.
  * [Regression] Support for libmpg123 older than 1.14.0 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: Support for emulating libmodplug
    0.8.7 API/ABI has been removed.
  * [Bug] xmp-openmpt: Sample rate and number of output channels
    were not applied correctly when using per-file settings.
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Prevent libsdl2 and libsdl from being enabled
    at the same time because they conflict with each other.
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour
  * IT: In Compatible Gxx mode, allow sample changes next to a tone
    portamento effect if a previous sample has already stopped
    playing.
  * IT: Fix broken volume envelopes with negative values as found
    in breakdwn.it by Elysis.
  * MOD: Slides and delayed notes are executed on every repetition
    of a row with row delay (fixes “ode to protracker”).
  * XM: If the sustain point of the panning envelope is reached
    before key-off, it is never released.
  * XM: Do not default recall volume / panning for delayed
    instrument-less notes
  * XM :E60 loop bug was not considered in song length calucation.
  * S3M: Notes without instrument number use previous note’s sample
    offset.
  * Tighten M15 and MOD file rejection heuristics.
  * J2B: Ignore frequency limits from file header.
    Fixes Medivo.j2b, broken since libopenmpt-0.2.6401-beta17.
  * STM: More accurate tempo calculation.
  * STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files
    have been found in the wild, though).
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * SFX: Work around bad conversions of the “Operation Stealth”
    soundtrack by turning pattern breaks into note stops.
  * IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down and the cutoff range was
    too small.
  * ParamEq plugin center frequency was not limited correctly.
  * Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
  * The “note cut” duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
    previously playing sample.
  * A song starting with non-existing patterns could not be played.
  * DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
  * DTM: Import global volume.
  * MOD: Support notes in octave 2, like in FastTracker 2
    (fixes DOPE.MOD).
  * Do not apply Amiga playback heuristics to MOD files that have
    clearly been written with a PC tracker.
  * MPTM: More logical release node behaviour.
  * Subsong search is now less thorough. It could previously find
    many subsongs that are technically correct (unplayed rows at
    the beginning of patterns that have been jumped over due to
    pattern breaks), but so far no real-world module that would
    require such a thorough subsong detection was found. The old
    mechanism caused way more false positives than intended with
    real-world modules, though.
  * Restrict the unpacked size of compressed DMF, IT, MDL and MO3
    samples to avoid huge allocations with malformed small files.

Mon Oct 22 20:27:59 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to version 0.3.13:
  * [Sec] Crash with malformed MED files.
  * Transposed samples in AMF ASYLUM modules were not played
    correctly.
  * Notes triggered by libopenmpt_ext play_note could be played
    with a panbrello effect if the same virtual channel was
    previously used with panbrello.
  * Clicks when stopping channels that didn’t end at zero volume.
  * XM: Do not import non-standard commands N and M as channel
    volume commands.

Mon Sep 24 20:13:26 UTC 2018 - 9+suse@cirno.systems

- Update to version 0.3.12:
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour.
  * libopenmpt now compiles without warnings with GCC 8.
  * Jump commands on the same row as the end of a pattern loop
    covering the restart position of the module could cause the
    module to loop even when looping was disabled.
  * MO3: Reject overly long MP3 and Vorbis samples.
  * play_note from the libopenmpt_ext interface sometimes silenced
    the start of a triggered sample.

  * [Sec] Crash with some malformed custom tunings in MPTM files
  * Channels whose volume envelope was playing at volume 0 while
    being moved to a NNA background channel were cut off completely
    since libopenmpt 0.3.8.
  * AMF (ASYLUM): Convert 7-bit panning to 8-bit panning for
    playback
- Update to version 0.3.10:
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] AMF: Undefined behaviour in loader code could lead to
    files playing silent.
  * Switching between instruments with portamento did not update
    the NNA settings for the new instrument.
  * FAR: Properly import volume commands.
  * [Sec] Possible write near address 0 in out-of-memory situations
    when reading AMS files.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Fixed build failure in C++17 due to use of
    removed feature std::random_shuffle.
  * STM: Having both Bxx and Cxx commands in a pattern imported the
    Bxx command incorrectly.
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * Speed up reading of truncated ULT files.
  * ULT: Portamento import was sometimes broken.
  * The resonant filter was sometimes unstable when combining
    low-volume samples, low cutoff and high mixing rates.
