    <version>0.4.0</version>
    <time>1545996713</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 0.4.0:
  * [New] libopenmpt now includes emulation of the OPL chip and
    thus plays OPL instruments in S3M, C67 and MPTM files.
    OPL chip emulation volume can be changed with the new ctl
    render.opl.volume_factor.
  * [New] libopenmpt now supports CDFM / Composer 670 module files.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New ctl play.at_end can be used to change
    what happens when the song end is reached:
    - “fadeout”: Fades the module out for a short while.
      Subsequent reads after the fadeout will return 0 rendered
      frames. This is the default and identical to the behaviour
      in previous libopenmpt versions.
    - “continue”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will continue playing from the song
      start or loop start. This can be used for custom loop logic,
      such as loop auto-detection and longer fadeouts.
    - “stop”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will return 0 rendered frames.
  * [New] Add new metadata fields &quot;originaltype&quot; and
    &quot;originaltype_long&quot; which allow more clearly reflecting what
    is going on with converted formats like MO3 and GDM.
  * [Change] openmpt123: openmpt123 now rejects --output-type in
    --ui and --batch modes and also rejects --output in --render
    mode. These combinations of options really made no sense and
    were rather confusing.
  * [Regression] Support for libmpg123 older than 1.14.0 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: Support for emulating libmodplug
    0.8.7 API/ABI has been removed.
  * [Bug] xmp-openmpt: Sample rate and number of output channels
    were not applied correctly when using per-file settings.
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Prevent libsdl2 and libsdl from being enabled
    at the same time because they conflict with each other.
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour
  * IT: In Compatible Gxx mode, allow sample changes next to a tone
    portamento effect if a previous sample has already stopped
    playing.
  * IT: Fix broken volume envelopes with negative values as found
    in breakdwn.it by Elysis.
  * MOD: Slides and delayed notes are executed on every repetition
    of a row with row delay (fixes “ode to protracker”).
  * XM: If the sustain point of the panning envelope is reached
    before key-off, it is never released.
  * XM: Do not default recall volume / panning for delayed
    instrument-less notes
  * XM :E60 loop bug was not considered in song length calucation.
  * S3M: Notes without instrument number use previous note’s sample
    offset.
  * Tighten M15 and MOD file rejection heuristics.
  * J2B: Ignore frequency limits from file header.
    Fixes Medivo.j2b, broken since libopenmpt-0.2.6401-beta17.
  * STM: More accurate tempo calculation.
  * STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files
    have been found in the wild, though).
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * SFX: Work around bad conversions of the “Operation Stealth”
    soundtrack by turning pattern breaks into note stops.
  * IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down and the cutoff range was
    too small.
  * ParamEq plugin center frequency was not limited correctly.
  * Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
  * The “note cut” duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
    previously playing sample.
  * A song starting with non-existing patterns could not be played.
  * DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
  * DTM: Import global volume.
  * MOD: Support notes in octave 2, like in FastTracker 2
    (fixes DOPE.MOD).
  * Do not apply Amiga playback heuristics to MOD files that have
    clearly been written with a PC tracker.
  * MPTM: More logical release node behaviour.
  * Subsong search is now less thorough. It could previously find
    many subsongs that are technically correct (unplayed rows at
    the beginning of patterns that have been jumped over due to
    pattern breaks), but so far no real-world module that would
    require such a thorough subsong detection was found. The old
    mechanism caused way more false positives than intended with
    real-world modules, though.
  * Restrict the unpacked size of compressed DMF, IT, MDL and MO3
    samples to avoid huge allocations with malformed small files.

    visibility=hidden set on non-MSVC systems, which made them not
    publicly accessible.
  * MO3: Apply playback changes based on “ModPlug-made” header flag
- Drop libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch
- Add libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch: Add missing
  CSoundFile compat API (bug #1180).

  * MOD: Sample swapping was always enabled since it has been
    separated from the ProTracker 1/2 compatibility flag. Now it is
    always enabled for Amiga-style modules and otherwise the old
    heuristic is used again.

    <comment>- Update to version 0.4.9 bsc#1153102 CVE-2019-17113
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C API: Limit the length of strings copied to
    the output buffer of ModPlug_InstrumentName() and
    ModPlug_SampleName() to 32 bytes (including terminating null)
    as is done by original libmodplug. This avoids potential buffer
    overflows in software relying on this limit instead of querying
    the required buffer size beforehand. libopenmpt can return
    strings longer than 32 bytes here beacuse the internal limit of
    32 bytes applies to strings encoded in arbitrary character
    encodings but the API returns them converted to UTF-8, which
    can be longer. (reported by Antonio Morales Maldonado of Semmle
    Security Research Team) (r12129)
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C++ API: Do not return 0 in
    CSoundFile::GetSampleName() and CSoundFile::GetInstrumentName()
    when a null output pointer is provided. This behaviour differed
    from libmodplug and made it impossible to determine the
    required buffer size. (r12130)

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to out-of-bounds read when playing an
    OPL note with active filter in S3M or MPTM files (r12118).
- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * J2B: Ignore notes with non-existing instrument

    <time>1608317528</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.5.4:
  * AMS: An upper bound for uncompressed sample size is now
    established to avoid memory exhaustion from malformed files.
  * DMF: Support early format beta versions (in particular versions
    1-4).
  * MED: Also use octave wrapping in 8-channel mode for MMD0/MMD1
    modules.
  * MED: If 8-channel mode is activated, ignore BPM mode.
  * MED: Emulate tempo commands F01 and F02 quirk.
  * MED: Tempo commands below 32 BPM were interpreted as tempo
    slides.
  * IMF: Instrument sample mapping was off by one octave, notable
    in the guitar part of Astaris by Karsten Koch.
Changes in 0.5.3:
  * [Sec] Possible hang if a MED file claimed to contain 256 songs.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt: openmpt::is_extension_supported2() exported
    symbol was missing (C++).
  * [Bug] openmpt::module::set_position_seconds sometimes behaved
    as if the song end was reached when seeking into a pattern loop
    and in some other corner cases.
  * Increase threshold for ignoring panning commands from 820 to
    830.
  * Subsong names now fall back to the first pattern’s name if
    empty.
  * MO3: Avoid certain ModPlug hacks from being fixed up twice,
    which could lead to e.g. very narrow pan swing range for old
    OpenMPT IT files saved with a recent MO3 encoder version.
  * MO3: Some files with corrupted envelope data could be rejected
    completely (normally libopenmpt should fix up the envelope
    data).</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.5:
  * [Bug] stb_vorbis: Fix decoding of Vorbis streams without
    comments which affected most Vorbis samples since stb_vorbis
    v1.20.
  * openmpt::ext::interactive::set_pitch_factor wasn’t applied to
    OPL voices.
  * OPL channel state (in particular current patch) is now updated
    when seeking.
  * The FT2 tremolo quirk is now also applied to MOD files.
    FT2 just copied the quirky code from ProTracker!
  * DMF: Preserve effects better in some situations where there is
    more than one effect in a pattern cell.
  * DMF: Improve import of finetune effect with parameters larger
    than +/-15.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.7:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_seconds with a position past the
    song end, and another openmpt::module::read call.
  * IT: Instrument / sample panning was reset on note-off / fade
    commands.
  * IMF: Set Finetune is now implemented correctly.
  * Fixed excessive memory consumption with malformed files in
    various formats.

- Update to 0.5.6:
  * AMS: Avoid allocating excessive amount of memory for compressed
    song message in malformed files.
  * S3M: Some samples or OPL patches were imported with a too high
    sample rate if module was saved with Scream Tracker 3.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.5.10:
  * S3M: Honor the Stereo flag not being set. This improves the
    sound of some tunes like Turbulence by Purple Motion.
  * S3M: Detect MPT 1.0 alpha versions which didn’t set the Stereo
    flag. In this case, the unset Stereo flag is also ignored
    because MPT 1.0 alpha used the default S3M channel panning
    anyway.
  * S3M: Only for OPL instruments the high sample rate bits should
    be ignored; for PCM instruments they are clamped to 65535 Hz.
  * MOD: Do not apply ProTracker loop length quirk to MODs that
    could have been made with Scream Tracker (fixes Soul-O-Matic
    by Purple Motion).
  * AMF (DSMI): Format revisions 1 and 9, as well as early
    (technically malformed) revision 10 files, are now supported.
    Surround panning commands and instrument number without note
    are now converted correctly.
  * AMF (DSMI): Patterns and samples were not read correctly in
    some files (e.g. AVOID.AMF).
  * GDM: Correctly import extra-fine portamentos.
- Update to 0.5.9:
  * The retrigger effect didn’t work correctly for OPL instruments
    in some cases depending on the chosen output sample rate.
  * S3M: Emulate IT short sample retrigger quirk in S3M files saved
    with Impulse Tracker and Schism Tracker.
  * ProTracker 3.6 doesn’t support sample swapping. It is now
    disabled when loading a ProTracker 3.6 IFF module.
  * Some files with “hidden” garbage patterns were not played
    correctly since libopenmpt 0.5.3.
  * MOD: E9x retrigger now works the same way as in ProTracker 2.
  * MDL: Improve auto-vibrato accuracy.
  * 669: Reject files that contain any pattern tempo higher than
    15.
  * Reduce memory consumption of malformed XPK-compressed files.
- Update to 0.5.8:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_order_row pointing to an invalid
    pattern, and another openmpt::module::read call. To trigger the
    crash, pattern 0 must not exist in the file and the tick speed
    before the position jump must be lower than the initial speed
    of the module.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt 0.5.7 broke seeking in some subsongs.
  * The built-in LFO plugin did not load the correct initial LFO
    frequency.
  * IT command S7x (instrument control) is now supported when
    seeking with sample sync enabled.
  * libopenmpt_ext play_note was cutting of channels even when
    there were plenty of free channels to use.

    access non-existent plugin slots FX251-FX255.
  * [Sec] Possible read beyond sample start after swapping to a
    sample with loop points set but not loop enabled.
  * [Sec] Fixed various possible crashes with malformed MMCMP
    files.
  * [Sec] MED: Possible read past end of sequence name
    (stack-allocated, so relatively unlikely to result in a
    crash).
  * Fixed excessive memory usage with files claiming to have an
    extremely high rows per beat count while also using tempo
    swing. Maximum rows per beat are now limited to 65536.
  * STP: Avoid creating thousands of patterns when loading
    malformed files even though no more pattern data can be read.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.14:
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-bounds read in Chorus plugin with NaN
    plugin parameters. Most implementations of the “fast math”
    compiler optimizations will prevent this crash but it is not
    guaranteed. (r16096)
  * [Bug] Fixed undefined behaviour with custom tunings found with
    ubsan.
  * OPL: Improved channel allocation strategy when there are lots
    of faded-out notes.
  * MOD: Digital Tracker MODs have four unknown bytes right after
    the magic bytes which seem to be ignored even by Digital
    Tracker itself. Just skip over them.
  * The logic when to turn off the resonant filter was broken in
    some edge cases since libopenmpt 0.5.1.
  * IMF: Implemented XE1-XE3 commands, which disable individual
    envelopes. Command Nxy (cutoff slide + resonance) is now also
    partially supported (only resonance for now).
  * IMF: Filter envelopes were upside down.
  * MTM: Omitting pattern loading through the load.skip_patterns
    ctl caused sample data to be corrupted.
  * S3M: Ignore O00 commands in files created with Scream Tracker
    3.00 and 3.01, as this command only gained effect memory in
    version 3.03.
  * STM: Use S3M-like sample swap behaviour.
  * XM: Disable arpeggio quirk for XMs made with Skale Tracker.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.6.1:
  * [Bug] Possible hang with malformed DMF, DSM, MED, MUS, OKT and
    SymMOD files containing 65536 or more patterns when destroying
    the module.
  * [Bug] Avoid NaNs and infinite values with custom tunings and in
    the I3DL2Reverb plugin.
  * MIDI macros are now evaluated when seeking.
  * The letter “z” is now evaluated in fixed MIDI macros (Z80…ZFF)
    the same way as in Impulse Tracker.
  * MOD: Loosened VBlank timing heuristics so that “frame of mind”
    by Dascon plays correctly.
  * MOD: Validate the contents of “hidden” patterns beyond the end
    of the order list when the file size matches the expected size
    when only taken “official” patterns into account. This fixes
    Shofixti Ditty.mod from Star Control 2 while keeping other
    (partly broken) modules working.
  * MED: Command 20 (reverse sample) is now only applied when it’s
    next to a note.
  * S3M: Introducing the “Send OPL key-off when triggering notes”
    compatibility setting broke retrigger for OPL notes again
    (they retriggered rather than not retriggering).
  * S3M: Retriggering a note no longer resets its pitch after a
    portamento.
  * S3M: Partially implement retrigger behaviour for stopped notes
    in SoundBlaster mode: Like in IT, it is not possible to
    retrigger a sample that has already stopped playing.
  * DIGI: Improve compatibility with E3x reverse sample command.
  * DSym: Tempos &lt; 32 were treated as tempo slides.
  * SymMOD: Key-off command was not implemented properly.

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.6.6
  * [Sec] Possible crash when playing manipulated IT / MPTM files
    with a T00 command.
  * MTM: In MultiTracker, setting speed and tempo are mutually
    exclusive commands. Still, some MultiTracker modules were made
    to be played with external players such as DMP, so they
    actually rely on “standard” speed / tempo behaviour. Decide
    which behaviour to use by checking of speed and tempo commands
    are found on the same row.
  * MTM: Ignore sample loops if the loop end is &lt;= 2.
  * Echo DMO: Migrate left and right delay values in modules made
    with OpenMPT versions between 1.27.01.00 and 1.30.05.00 to the
    correct interpretation.
- Changes in 0.6.5:
  * [Bug] Makefile now also uses CC, CXX, LD, and AR when set as
    environment variables.
  * [New] Makefile now uses PKG_CONFIG as path to pkg-config.
  * DBM: Sample middle-C frequencies were slightly off.
    laffik_-_marynarze.dbm sounds much more bearable now.
  * DBM: Fixed pattern break parameter interpretation.
  * Echo DMO: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a 2-second
    echo delay instead of 1ms.
  * Digi Booster Echo: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a
    510ms echo delay instead of approximately 334ms.</comment>

    the filter if cutoff / resonance was previously 127 / 0.
  * S3M Detect files saved with Graoumf Tracker instead of claiming
    they were made with OpenMPT 4.47.
  * S3M: Pattern loop state was not propagated anymore since
    libopenmpt 0.6.0, leading to wrong song length calculation and
    SB0 + SBx being located on different channels not working
    properly anymore.</comment>

  * The fix for the OPL cutoff bug introduced in libopenmpt 0.6.7
    was incomplete.
  * ULT: Offset commands exceeding 65535 samples were sometimes not
    imported correctly even if there was room for them.
  * After seeking with seek.sync_samples=1, the filter settings of
    playing notes were not updated since libopenmpt 0.6.7.
  * Loading of and seeking inside (malformed) modules with
    thousands of short sub-songs has been sped up.</comment>

    from unseekable files..
  * [Sec] Write buffer overflow when reading unseekable files close

  * [Sec] Possible out-of-memory (32bit platforms) or excessive
    memory allocation (64bit platforms) when reading malformed data
    from unseekable files.
  * [Sec] DMF: Possible null-pointer write or excessive memory
    allocation when reading DMF files.
  * IT: In the previous version, Zxx macros in IT files made with
    older MPT versions were no longer working.
  * There was a periodic click when playing a module using the
    Chorus or Flanger DMO plugin at a mix rate exceeding
    ~136.5 kHz.
  * An older bugfix for undefined behaviour in the Distortion DMO
    plugin was incorrect, causing the distorted sound to be
    different in some situations.
  * xmp-openmpt: Metadata retrievel for playlist items was broken.
- Changes in 0.7.4:
  * [Bug] Makefile: libopenmpt 0.7.3 broke running the test suite
    for Emscripten builds.
  * openmpt123: openmpt123 now uses a narrower layout on terminal
    windows with a width of less than 72 characters.
  * Setting all possible load_skip flags resulted in nothing being
    loaded at all, instead of just not loading the selected module
    parts.
  * When playing all subsongs, set_position_seconds didn’t always
    calculate the correct subsong to jump to.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.7:
  * IT: Disable a few more compatibility flags for older
    SchismTracker builds.
  * IT: Halve the output volume of files saved with ChibiTracker,
    as its mixer is about half as loud as ours.
  * S3M: In mono mode, the ratio between sample and OPL volume was
    incorrect.
  * S3M: Detect files saved with PlayerPRO.
  * XM: Detect files saved with PlayerPRO. Improved detection of
    files saved with ModPlug Tracker.
  * XM: Files with impossibly small pattern headers are now
    rejected, like FastTracker 2 does.
  * STK: Loosen SoundTracker file rejection heuristics a bit to
    allow loading of files with malformed song titles and overly
    long samples. Other heuristics has been tightened a bit.
  * MOD: Change VBlank timing heuristic to always assume CIA timing
    when long samples unsupported by original ProTracker) are
    found.
  * MOD: Disable NoiseTracker quirks if empty sample slots have a
    default volume other than 0.
  * MOD: 7-bit panning detection may have returned incorrect
    results for MODs with a channel count other than 4.
  * MED: Improve handling of default tempo, panning and channel
    volume in files containing more than one song.
  * MO3: Reduced maximum allowed music data (not samples) size
    from 2 GiB to 512 MiB.
  * XMF: Header validation is now stricter.
  * MDL: Slightly more accurate import of pattern command 9
    (enabling envelopes instead of setting envelope position).
  * ULT: Support the highest three octaves.</comment>

    has been changed from forcing -O1 on GCC 14 to setting
    -fno-ipa-ra on all GCC versions on non-ELF platforms.
  * MOD: Allow sample swapping to work when swapping from a
    non-looping, stopped sample back to a looping sample
    (fixes MOD.energy).
  * DBM: Import second sustain point in case the first sustain
    point is not set, or if it has a lower index than the first.
  * DBM: When several instruments referenced the same sample with
    different properties (volume, loop points, etc.), only one set
    of properties was imported (fixes DBM.Supernova).
  * DBM: Prioritize effects more correctly when the same effect is
    encountered in both effect columns of a cell
    (fixes DBM.143_Gnoj).
  * DBM: Don’t import offset effects when there’s a tone portmento
    next to them.
  * DBM: A few IT-specific playback quirks are disabled for more
    accurate playback (e.g. in “Are You Flying With Me?” by
    Jazzcat).
  * DIGI: Sample play direction was reset if adjacent channel
    contained a Note Cut note.
  * AMF: When running out of sample slots, file reading became be
    misaligned because the sample name was not skipped.
  * MED: Command 0F was not imported.
  * MED: Upper frequency limits should be more accurate now.
  * MED: Channel panning is now only applied in MMD2 files if the</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.11:
  * IT: Don’t import SAx High Offset command for IT 1.xx modules.
    This feature was added in Impulse Tracker 2.00.
  * IT: Limit Vxx parameter to V80 for files made with old Schism
    Tracker versions.
  * IT / S3M: Impulse Tracker 2.14 patch version information was
    incorrect.
  * S3M: O00 effects are no longer ignored if the tracker version
    in the file header indicates Scream Tracker 3.00 / 3.01,
    but the file was clearly saved with another tool (e.g. UNMO3).
  * S3M: As files made with Scream Tracker 3.20 and 3.21 cannot be
    told apart, both versions are now listed in the tracker
    metadata.
  * ULT: Try to preserve global commands if there’s e.g. both a
    speed and tempo command in the same cell.
  * STM: Improved tracker identification metadata.
  * SymMOD: When running out of Zxx macros, try to find the closest
    macro to use instead.
  * SymMOD: Ignore unknown hunks instead of rejecting entire file,
    as that’s what Symphonie does as well.
  * OKT: Disable loop on type “B” samples if they’re used on a
    mixed channel.
  * OKT: The last sample slot was never loaded.
  * PTM: Halve offset command strength for 16-bit samples.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.13:
  * module::get_current_estimated_bpm could return infinity when
    rows per beat was set to 0. A default of 4 rows per beat is now
    assumed in this situation. The internal LFO plugin was also
    affected in Tempo Sync mode.
  * Instruments that have a MIDI channel assigned and NNA set to
    “Continue” could cause NNA channel starvation.
  * In non-compatible linear slide mode, the sample rate could wrap
    around with portamento slides to extremely low frequencies.
    This should only happen in compatible mode.
- Changes in 0.7.12:
  * [Bug] Fixed various undefined behaviour found with ubsan.
  * IT: Don’t report files claiming to be made with Impulse Tracker
    2.08+ as IT-made if they have no edit timer.
  * IT: Ignore sample data in slots that don’t have the “sample
    data present” flag set, if the file vaguely looks IT-made to
    avoid playing garbage caused by an Impulse Tracker bug that
    should not be audible.
  * S3M: Detect early Schism Tracker versions.
  * MOD: When trying to detect MOD files with broken order lists,
    the file size is now rounded down to an even number. This helps
    identifying some malformed files (MOD files can technically not
    have an odd size).
  * MOD: Also enable ProTracker-compatible tremolo ramp waveform
    for M!K! modules.
  * MOD: In ProTracker 1/2 mode, retrigger with instrument-less
    notes now keeps using the previous sample offset.
  * Warn when a Startrekker AM file most likely requires an
    (currently unsupported) external instrument definition file.
  * DBM / IMF / MED: When merging pattern commands, allow to move</comment>

    adding support for the previously missing
    tremor / tremolo / vibrato.
  * [New] NST: His Master’s Noise “Mupp” instruments are now
    supported, as well as command 7 “mega-arp”.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New APIs for determining whether order list
    entries or pattern indices have a special meaning:
      openmpt::module::is_order_skip_entry(),
      openmpt::module::is_pattern_skip_item(),
      openmpt::module::is_order_stop_entry(),
      openmpt::module::is_pattern_stop_item() (C++),

    <comment>- Update to 0.8.1:
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Allow for converting to libsndfile formats
    which list the file extension only in the subformat
    (i.e. MP3 with libsndfile 1.1.0 or later).
  * [Change] TCB was added to the list of supported file
    extensions. ModLand and Fujiology use this extension for
    TCB Tracker modules, instead of the canonical MOD extension.
  * IT: Fixed various interactions between Note Cut effect and
    portamentos.
  * MED: When triggering a synth note with a Synth Jump command on
    the same row, the initial speed command was not executed.
  * S3M: Old ModPlug Tracker versions allowed the 28th character
    of sample names to be used. Such sample names are now read
    correctly again.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.8.2:
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-bounds sample data read in a specific
    combination of reverse sample playback + offset past sample
    loop. (r23711).
  * [Bug] Fixed pre-C++20 undefined behaviour due to left-shifting
    negative integer values.
  * Since libopenmpt 0.8.0, swapping between samples on the rear
    channels could introduce a click on the front channels.
  * IT: Volume column slides no longer propagate their effect
    memory to the regular effect column volume slides.
  * FC: Allow files with a sequence size of 0 to load (fixes a
    broken copy of cult.smod).</comment>
