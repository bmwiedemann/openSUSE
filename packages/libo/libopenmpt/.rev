    <version>0.4.0</version>
    <time>1545996713</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 0.4.0:
  * [New] libopenmpt now includes emulation of the OPL chip and
    thus plays OPL instruments in S3M, C67 and MPTM files.
    OPL chip emulation volume can be changed with the new ctl
    render.opl.volume_factor.
  * [New] libopenmpt now supports CDFM / Composer 670 module files.
  * [New] libopenmpt: New ctl play.at_end can be used to change
    what happens when the song end is reached:
    - “fadeout”: Fades the module out for a short while.
      Subsequent reads after the fadeout will return 0 rendered
      frames. This is the default and identical to the behaviour
      in previous libopenmpt versions.
    - “continue”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will continue playing from the song
      start or loop start. This can be used for custom loop logic,
      such as loop auto-detection and longer fadeouts.
    - “stop”: Returns 0 rendered frames when the song end is
      reached. Subsequent reads will return 0 rendered frames.
  * [New] Add new metadata fields &quot;originaltype&quot; and
    &quot;originaltype_long&quot; which allow more clearly reflecting what
    is going on with converted formats like MO3 and GDM.
  * [Change] openmpt123: openmpt123 now rejects --output-type in
    --ui and --batch modes and also rejects --output in --render
    mode. These combinations of options really made no sense and
    were rather confusing.
  * [Regression] Support for libmpg123 older than 1.14.0 has been
    removed.
  * [Regression] libmodplug: Support for emulating libmodplug
    0.8.7 API/ABI has been removed.
  * [Bug] xmp-openmpt: Sample rate and number of output channels
    were not applied correctly when using per-file settings.
  * [Bug] Internal mixer state was not initialized properly when
    initially rendering in 44100kHz stereo format.
  * [Bug] openmpt123: Prevent libsdl2 and libsdl from being enabled
    at the same time because they conflict with each other.
  * [Bug] libmodplug: Setting SNDMIX_NORESAMPLING in the C++ API
    always resulted in linear interpolation instead of nearest
    neighbour
  * IT: In Compatible Gxx mode, allow sample changes next to a tone
    portamento effect if a previous sample has already stopped
    playing.
  * IT: Fix broken volume envelopes with negative values as found
    in breakdwn.it by Elysis.
  * MOD: Slides and delayed notes are executed on every repetition
    of a row with row delay (fixes “ode to protracker”).
  * XM: If the sustain point of the panning envelope is reached
    before key-off, it is never released.
  * XM: Do not default recall volume / panning for delayed
    instrument-less notes
  * XM :E60 loop bug was not considered in song length calucation.
  * S3M: Notes without instrument number use previous note’s sample
    offset.
  * Tighten M15 and MOD file rejection heuristics.
  * J2B: Ignore frequency limits from file header.
    Fixes Medivo.j2b, broken since libopenmpt-0.2.6401-beta17.
  * STM: More accurate tempo calculation.
  * STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files
    have been found in the wild, though).
  * STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
  * SFX: Work around bad conversions of the “Operation Stealth”
    soundtrack by turning pattern breaks into note stops.
  * IMF: Filter cutoff was upside down and the cutoff range was
    too small.
  * ParamEq plugin center frequency was not limited correctly.
  * Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
  * The “note cut” duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
    previously playing sample.
  * A song starting with non-existing patterns could not be played.
  * DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
  * DTM: Import global volume.
  * MOD: Support notes in octave 2, like in FastTracker 2
    (fixes DOPE.MOD).
  * Do not apply Amiga playback heuristics to MOD files that have
    clearly been written with a PC tracker.
  * MPTM: More logical release node behaviour.
  * Subsong search is now less thorough. It could previously find
    many subsongs that are technically correct (unplayed rows at
    the beginning of patterns that have been jumped over due to
    pattern breaks), but so far no real-world module that would
    require such a thorough subsong detection was found. The old
    mechanism caused way more false positives than intended with
    real-world modules, though.
  * Restrict the unpacked size of compressed DMF, IT, MDL and MO3
    samples to avoid huge allocations with malformed small files.

    visibility=hidden set on non-MSVC systems, which made them not
    publicly accessible.
  * MO3: Apply playback changes based on “ModPlug-made” header flag
- Drop libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch
- Add libmodplug-no-exported-cpp-api-quickfix-v1.patch: Add missing
  CSoundFile compat API (bug #1180).

  * MOD: Sample swapping was always enabled since it has been
    separated from the ProTracker 1/2 compatibility flag. Now it is
    always enabled for Amiga-style modules and otherwise the old
    heuristic is used again.

    <comment>- Update to version 0.4.9 bsc#1153102 CVE-2019-17113
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C API: Limit the length of strings copied to
    the output buffer of ModPlug_InstrumentName() and
    ModPlug_SampleName() to 32 bytes (including terminating null)
    as is done by original libmodplug. This avoids potential buffer
    overflows in software relying on this limit instead of querying
    the required buffer size beforehand. libopenmpt can return
    strings longer than 32 bytes here beacuse the internal limit of
    32 bytes applies to strings encoded in arbitrary character
    encodings but the API returns them converted to UTF-8, which
    can be longer. (reported by Antonio Morales Maldonado of Semmle
    Security Research Team) (r12129)
  * [Sec] libmodplug: C++ API: Do not return 0 in
    CSoundFile::GetSampleName() and CSoundFile::GetInstrumentName()
    when a null output pointer is provided. This behaviour differed
    from libmodplug and made it impossible to determine the
    required buffer size. (r12130)

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * [Sec] Possible crash due to out-of-bounds read when playing an
    OPL note with active filter in S3M or MPTM files (r12118).
- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * J2B: Ignore notes with non-existing instrument

    <time>1608317528</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.5.4:
  * AMS: An upper bound for uncompressed sample size is now
    established to avoid memory exhaustion from malformed files.
  * DMF: Support early format beta versions (in particular versions
    1-4).
  * MED: Also use octave wrapping in 8-channel mode for MMD0/MMD1
    modules.
  * MED: If 8-channel mode is activated, ignore BPM mode.
  * MED: Emulate tempo commands F01 and F02 quirk.
  * MED: Tempo commands below 32 BPM were interpreted as tempo
    slides.
  * IMF: Instrument sample mapping was off by one octave, notable
    in the guitar part of Astaris by Karsten Koch.
Changes in 0.5.3:
  * [Sec] Possible hang if a MED file claimed to contain 256 songs.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt: openmpt::is_extension_supported2() exported
    symbol was missing (C++).
  * [Bug] openmpt::module::set_position_seconds sometimes behaved
    as if the song end was reached when seeking into a pattern loop
    and in some other corner cases.
  * Increase threshold for ignoring panning commands from 820 to
    830.
  * Subsong names now fall back to the first pattern’s name if
    empty.
  * MO3: Avoid certain ModPlug hacks from being fixed up twice,
    which could lead to e.g. very narrow pan swing range for old
    OpenMPT IT files saved with a recent MO3 encoder version.
  * MO3: Some files with corrupted envelope data could be rejected
    completely (normally libopenmpt should fix up the envelope
    data).</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.5:
  * [Bug] stb_vorbis: Fix decoding of Vorbis streams without
    comments which affected most Vorbis samples since stb_vorbis
    v1.20.
  * openmpt::ext::interactive::set_pitch_factor wasn’t applied to
    OPL voices.
  * OPL channel state (in particular current patch) is now updated
    when seeking.
  * The FT2 tremolo quirk is now also applied to MOD files.
    FT2 just copied the quirky code from ProTracker!
  * DMF: Preserve effects better in some situations where there is
    more than one effect in a pattern cell.
  * DMF: Improve import of finetune effect with parameters larger
    than +/-15.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.7:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_seconds with a position past the
    song end, and another openmpt::module::read call.
  * IT: Instrument / sample panning was reset on note-off / fade
    commands.
  * IMF: Set Finetune is now implemented correctly.
  * Fixed excessive memory consumption with malformed files in
    various formats.

- Update to 0.5.6:
  * AMS: Avoid allocating excessive amount of memory for compressed
    song message in malformed files.
  * S3M: Some samples or OPL patches were imported with a too high
    sample rate if module was saved with Scream Tracker 3.</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.5.10:
  * S3M: Honor the Stereo flag not being set. This improves the
    sound of some tunes like Turbulence by Purple Motion.
  * S3M: Detect MPT 1.0 alpha versions which didn’t set the Stereo
    flag. In this case, the unset Stereo flag is also ignored
    because MPT 1.0 alpha used the default S3M channel panning
    anyway.
  * S3M: Only for OPL instruments the high sample rate bits should
    be ignored; for PCM instruments they are clamped to 65535 Hz.
  * MOD: Do not apply ProTracker loop length quirk to MODs that
    could have been made with Scream Tracker (fixes Soul-O-Matic
    by Purple Motion).
  * AMF (DSMI): Format revisions 1 and 9, as well as early
    (technically malformed) revision 10 files, are now supported.
    Surround panning commands and instrument number without note
    are now converted correctly.
  * AMF (DSMI): Patterns and samples were not read correctly in
    some files (e.g. AVOID.AMF).
  * GDM: Correctly import extra-fine portamentos.
- Update to 0.5.9:
  * The retrigger effect didn’t work correctly for OPL instruments
    in some cases depending on the chosen output sample rate.
  * S3M: Emulate IT short sample retrigger quirk in S3M files saved
    with Impulse Tracker and Schism Tracker.
  * ProTracker 3.6 doesn’t support sample swapping. It is now
    disabled when loading a ProTracker 3.6 IFF module.
  * Some files with “hidden” garbage patterns were not played
    correctly since libopenmpt 0.5.3.
  * MOD: E9x retrigger now works the same way as in ProTracker 2.
  * MDL: Improve auto-vibrato accuracy.
  * 669: Reject files that contain any pattern tempo higher than
    15.
  * Reduce memory consumption of malformed XPK-compressed files.
- Update to 0.5.8:
  * [Sec] Possible null-pointer dereference read caused by a
    sequence of openmpt::module::read,
    openmpt::module::set_position_order_row pointing to an invalid
    pattern, and another openmpt::module::read call. To trigger the
    crash, pattern 0 must not exist in the file and the tick speed
    before the position jump must be lower than the initial speed
    of the module.
  * [Bug] libopenmpt 0.5.7 broke seeking in some subsongs.
  * The built-in LFO plugin did not load the correct initial LFO
    frequency.
  * IT command S7x (instrument control) is now supported when
    seeking with sample sync enabled.
  * libopenmpt_ext play_note was cutting of channels even when
    there were plenty of free channels to use.

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.11:
  * [Sec] Possible crash with malformed modules when trying to
    access non-existent plugin slots FX251-FX255.
  * [Sec] Possible read beyond sample start after swapping to a
    sample with loop points set but not loop enabled.
  * [Sec] Fixed various possible crashes with malformed MMCMP
    files.
  * [Sec] MED: Possible read past end of sequence name
    (stack-allocated, so relatively unlikely to result in a
    crash).
  * Fixed excessive memory usage with files claiming to have an
    extremely high rows per beat count while also using tempo
    swing. Maximum rows per beat are now limited to 65536.
  * STP: Avoid creating thousands of patterns when loading
    malformed files even though no more pattern data can be read.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.5.14:
  * [Sec] Possible out-of-bounds read in Chorus plugin with NaN
    plugin parameters. Most implementations of the “fast math”
    compiler optimizations will prevent this crash but it is not
    guaranteed. (r16096)
  * [Bug] Fixed undefined behaviour with custom tunings found with
    ubsan.
  * OPL: Improved channel allocation strategy when there are lots
    of faded-out notes.
  * MOD: Digital Tracker MODs have four unknown bytes right after
    the magic bytes which seem to be ignored even by Digital
    Tracker itself. Just skip over them.
  * The logic when to turn off the resonant filter was broken in
    some edge cases since libopenmpt 0.5.1.
  * IMF: Implemented XE1-XE3 commands, which disable individual
    envelopes. Command Nxy (cutoff slide + resonance) is now also
    partially supported (only resonance for now).
  * IMF: Filter envelopes were upside down.
  * MTM: Omitting pattern loading through the load.skip_patterns
    ctl caused sample data to be corrupted.
  * S3M: Ignore O00 commands in files created with Scream Tracker
    3.00 and 3.01, as this command only gained effect memory in
    version 3.03.
  * STM: Use S3M-like sample swap behaviour.
  * XM: Disable arpeggio quirk for XMs made with Skale Tracker.
    Fixes KAPTENFL.XM.</comment>

    <time>1643926582</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.6.1:
  * [Bug] Possible hang with malformed DMF, DSM, MED, MUS, OKT and
    SymMOD files containing 65536 or more patterns when destroying
    the module.
  * [Bug] Avoid NaNs and infinite values with custom tunings and in
    the I3DL2Reverb plugin.
  * MIDI macros are now evaluated when seeking.
  * The letter “z” is now evaluated in fixed MIDI macros (Z80…ZFF)
    the same way as in Impulse Tracker.
  * MOD: Loosened VBlank timing heuristics so that “frame of mind”
    by Dascon plays correctly.
  * MOD: Validate the contents of “hidden” patterns beyond the end
    of the order list when the file size matches the expected size
    when only taken “official” patterns into account. This fixes
    Shofixti Ditty.mod from Star Control 2 while keeping other
    (partly broken) modules working.
  * MED: Command 20 (reverse sample) is now only applied when it’s
    next to a note.
  * S3M: Introducing the “Send OPL key-off when triggering notes”
    compatibility setting broke retrigger for OPL notes again
    (they retriggered rather than not retriggering).
  * S3M: Retriggering a note no longer resets its pitch after a
    portamento.
  * S3M: Partially implement retrigger behaviour for stopped notes
    in SoundBlaster mode: Like in IT, it is not possible to
    retrigger a sample that has already stopped playing.
  * DIGI: Improve compatibility with E3x reverse sample command.
  * DSym: Tempos &lt; 32 were treated as tempo slides.
  * SymMOD: Key-off command was not implemented properly.

    <comment>- Update to 0.6.6
  * [Sec] Possible crash when playing manipulated IT / MPTM files
    with a T00 command.
  * MTM: In MultiTracker, setting speed and tempo are mutually
    exclusive commands. Still, some MultiTracker modules were made
    to be played with external players such as DMP, so they
    actually rely on “standard” speed / tempo behaviour. Decide
    which behaviour to use by checking of speed and tempo commands
    are found on the same row.
  * MTM: Ignore sample loops if the loop end is &lt;= 2.
  * Echo DMO: Migrate left and right delay values in modules made
    with OpenMPT versions between 1.27.01.00 and 1.30.05.00 to the
    correct interpretation.
- Changes in 0.6.5:
  * [Bug] Makefile now also uses CC, CXX, LD, and AR when set as
    environment variables.
  * [New] Makefile now uses PKG_CONFIG as path to pkg-config.
  * DBM: Sample middle-C frequencies were slightly off.
    laffik_-_marynarze.dbm sounds much more bearable now.
  * DBM: Fixed pattern break parameter interpretation.
  * Echo DMO: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a 2-second
    echo delay instead of 1ms.
  * Digi Booster Echo: Setting the delay parameter to 0 yielded a
    510ms echo delay instead of approximately 334ms.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.6.7
  * IT: In sample mode, portamento to a different sample turns off
    the filter if cutoff / resonance was previously 127 / 0.
  * S3M Detect files saved with Graoumf Tracker instead of claiming
    they were made with OpenMPT 4.47.
  * S3M: Pattern loop state was not propagated anymore since
    libopenmpt 0.6.0, leading to wrong song length calculation and
    SB0 + SBx being located on different channels not working
    properly anymore.</comment>
