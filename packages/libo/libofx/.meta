  <title>OFX Command Parser and API</title>
  <description>LibOFX is a parser and API designed to allow applications to support
OFX command responses, usually provided by financial institutions for
statement downloads. The author says, &quot;To my knowledge, it is the first
working OpenSource implementations of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange)
specification on the client side. This project was first started as my
end of degree project, with the goal of adding OFX support to GnuCash.
It has since evolved into a generic library, so all OpenSource
Financial software can benefit from it.&quot;</description>
