- update to 1.8:
  ** Changes in Behavior
    Schedule -f/--full combined with non-linewise operations for deprecation.
    In a future release, -f/--full will only be usable with operations where
    it makes sense. For now, we print a warning to stderr when -f/--full is
    used with non-linewise operations, and such usage will no longer be
    supported.
  * The bin operation now uses more intuitive bins. Previously, a command
    such as `datamash bin 1 <<< -0` would output -100; and -100 did not fall
    in its own bin. We now require all bins to take the form `[nx,(n+1)x)`
    with integer n and bin width x. We discard the sign on -0 and gate such
    inputs into the [0,x) bin.
  * Operations taking more than one argument now provide more complete output
    with --header-out. Previously, an operation such as `pcov x:y` would
    produce an output header like `pcov(y)`, discarding the `x`. The new
    behavior will output header `pcov(x,y)`.
  * datamash(1) no longer ignores --output-delimiter with the rmdup operation.
  ** New Features
  * New datamash option --sort-cmd argument to specify the program used
    by the -s option to sort input, plus enhancements to the security and
    portability of building sort command lines.
  * New datamash option -c/--collapse-delimiter=X argument uses character
    X instead of comma between values in collapse and unique lists.
  * New datamash operations: mean square (ms) and root mean square (rms).
  * Decorate now supports sorting IP addresses of both versions 4 and 6
    together. IPv4 addresses are logically converted to IPv6 addresses,
    either as IPv4-Mapped (ipv6v4map) or IPv4-Compatible (ipv6v4comp)
    addresses.
  * Add two command aliases:
      'echo' may now be used instead of 'cut'.
      'uniq' may now be used instead of 'unique'.

Sat Apr 25 20:09:33 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 1.7:
  * decorate(1): new program - sorts input in non-standard ordering
    e.g. IPv4, IPv6, roman numerals.
  * New operations: sha224/sha384
  * New operations: geomean (Geometric mean) and harmmean (Harmonic
    mean)
- includes changes from 1.6:
  * The 'gutnum' operation now correctly prints detected numbers
    without truncating them
