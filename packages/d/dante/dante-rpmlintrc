# dante.x86_64: E: shlib-policy-name-error (Badness: 10000) libdsocks
# Your package contains a single shared library but is not named after its
# SONAME.
#
# This is a false positive. libdsocks.so is a module (in libtool lingo)
# that is dlopened, strictly tied to /usr/bin/socksify, and thus
# shlib policy does not apply to it.
