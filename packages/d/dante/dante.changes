- dante.spec: instead of statically defining CFLAGS, parse out
  -grecord-gcc-switches from %{optflags}, since it causes problems
  for the configure script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 16 19:06:47 UTC 2013 - tabraham@suse.com

- update to dante-1.4.0

 o Older syntax for setting the socket buffer sizes via
   socket.recvbuf.udp, socket.sendbuf.udp, socket.recvbuf.tcp and
   socket.sendbuf.tcp options have been deprecated and replaced with
   the more general API for setting socket options.

   "socket.recvbuf.udp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.udp.so_rcvbuf"
   "socket.sendbuf.udp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.udp.so_sndbuf"
   "socket.recvbuf.tcp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.tcp.so_rcvbuf"
   "socket.sendbuf.tcp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.tcp.so_sndbuf"

   <interface-side> refers to either "internal", for Dante's internal
   interface(s), or "external", for Dante's external interface(s).

 o socks-rules now require a "socks" prefix (like client-rules require a
   "client" prefix), and the socks "method" keyword has been renamed to
   "socksmethod".

 o The "socksmethod" keyword can now be set in client-rules too.  It
   is used to override the default preference for what socksmethod to
   select for which clients addresses, making it possible to by
   default e.g., have the preference "gssapi username none", but for
   some client-ranges have a different preference, e.g., "none
   username gssapi".

   Normally there is no need to use set this keyword in a client-rule.

 o Fallback to direct (non-proxy) routes now defaults to off in the client,
   as well as in the server.

   To keep previous behaviour in the client, with direct route fallback
   for destinations with no matching route, set SOCKS_DIRECTROUTE_FALLBACK
   to "yes" in the environment, or ./configure with --enable-drt-fallback.

   Direct fallback is enabled if there are no routes configured (as is
   usually the case in a server configuration), and disabled otherwise.

 o IPv6 is now supported in the server.

   Standard IPv6 address syntax is used for addresses, with the addition
   of the special address "0/0" used for matching both all IPv4 and
   all IPv6 addresses.

 o New "monitor" object added.  Syntax is similar to rules and routes,
   but instead of applying to individual sessions, it applies to all
   sessions currently matching the addresses to monitor.

   This can be used for monitoring network anomalies related to too
   little data being transferred or too many disconnects occurring,
   triggering alarms if detected.

 o Possibility to configure system errors and DNS-errors for
   special logging in certain cases (when connecting and performing
   hostname resolving).

 o More aggressive regarding how many processes to fork when starting
   and how many processes to reserve for future clients.

 o Added new log keyword: "tcpinfo".  Used to report more extensive
   statistics about sessions, including TCP_INFO on supported platforms.

 o SIGINFO/SIGUSR1 output is now logged at level "info" instead of level
   "debug".

 o SIGHUP code rewritten.  Should function considerably better in
   environments were SIGHUP is, for whatever reason, sent an excessive
   amount of times every second.

 o Default for the maximum number of clients an i/o process can handle has
   been increased from 8 to 32.

 o Improved UDP compatibility by sending appropriate ICMP unreachable
   errors to clients and targets, if running with the appropriate
   privileges (typically, root is required for this).

   Makes it possible for a client or target to be notified that a UDP
   packet it wanted the Dante server to forward was not forwarded.

 o Reduction in memory consumption at the expense of allocating extra
   memory dynamically in the very rare, perhaps non-existing, cases
   where the extra memory is needed.

 o The default timeout for TCP i/o (timeout.io.tcp) has been changed from
   84000 to 0.  0 means use the kernels default, which in most cases will
   mean no timeout.  See UPGRADE for more information.

 o The session module has been merged with the mainstream Dante code,
   and has also been extended to support the following new features:
   - connection throttling (number of new sessions accepted per second).
   - state-keys.
     Two state keys are currently supported:
       - per-IP address.
       - per-hostid (hostid is supported on certain platforms, with
         certain kernel patches, with certain clients).

   The syntax has also changed (see UPGRADE).
   See the manual for more information about the new features.

 o Code used for finding the correct outgoing address to bind when
   external.rotation is set to "route" replaced with much simpler,
   but hopefully equally (or better) functioning code.
   Idea taken from Quagga.

 o Use getpassphrase() rather then getpass() to obtain password for
   username authentication when available. Avoids 9 character limit
   on Solaris.  Suggested by Albert Fluegel <af@muc.de.example.com>

 o Use sqrt() rather than sqrtl() in stddev calculation, as sqrtl() is not
   available on some platforms (such as FreeBSD 7.2).  Problem reported
   by Rudolf Polzer <rpolzer@one-it.de.example.org>.

 o If the authentication method used was RFC931 (ident), the username
   was not always logged when it should be.
   Reported by Gregory Charot (EVENIUM) <gcharot@evenium.com.example.com>.

 o Syntax checking has been improved to better detect invalid or
   likely incorrect server configurations.

   This can result in some configurations that have previously been
   accepted or accepted with warnings by Dante, to now cause an error
   on startup, preventing the Dante server from starting up until the
   configuration error has been fixed.

 o Fixed compilation on OpenBSD with compilers not supporting -Wbounded.
   Problem report and testing by
   Mikael More <mikael.more@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o GSSAPI "clear" is no longer enabled by default, as it is not part
   of the SOCKS GSSAPI standard per se.

 o external.rotation was not handling non-IPv4 target addresses correctly.
   Reported and diagnosed by Rudolf Polzer <rpolzer@one-it.de.example.com>.

 o The "--disable-libwrap" option has been renamed "--without-libwrap".

 o Fixed bug that would cause the following warning to sometimes be
   erroneously reported:
   "warning: accept(2) failed: Resource temporarily unavailable"

 o SIGINFO log information extended to include information about i/o
   buffer status and as well as UDP packet latency.

 o Real-time scheduling priority settings and CPU affinity settings made
   available in sockd.conf.

   See https://www.inet.no/dante/files/dante_realtime_preview.pdf for
   a performance analysis done in relation to these new features.

 o General API for setting socket options on sockets used by Dante
   made available in sockd.conf.

 o Support for cross compilation of client library for Android
   (system name 'arm-linux-androideabi').
   Testing and analysis by Yoav Weiss <weiss.yoav@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o Problem with sockd.init generation in dante.spec fixed.
   Reported by Luiz Gustavo Nascimento <luizgn@gmail.com.example.com>.

    dante-1.4.0-64bit_portability.patch
    dante-1.4.0-glibc-2.17.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 12 16:54:58 UTC 2012 - tabraham@novell.com

- fixed 64bit-portability-issue
- fixed some man page format problems

- update to 1.3.2
  * Part of possible resource optimization indicated in section 4.4
    of the Dante 1.3.1 performance evaluation report
    (http://www.inet.no/dante/doc/1.3.x/dante_performance_1.3.1.pdf)
    has been implemented: scheduling new clients to the Dante process
    with fewest free slots available.
  * If the proxy server (socks, http, or upnp) is configured via
    environment variables, don't attempt to also parse any socks.conf
    files
  * The "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable has been renamed to 
    "HTTP_CONNECT_PROXY" to avoid conflict with HTTP proxies that do
    not support the HTTP CONNECT request
  * Fixed an unintended change to ACL semantics regarding bind requests
    in Dante 1.2.3 noted by Ralf Wenk 
    <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com> many thanks
  * Fixed a bug regarding handling of cases where the ulimit for max
    number of files is unlimited. Reported and analyzed by Ralf Wenk
    <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com> 

- changes in 1.3.1
  * Fixed a bug regarding handling of socks clients that do not fillow
    the spec and start sending traffic data before request has been
    granted.
  * Fixed an error related to ACL on UDP-packets. If a given SOCKS
    client was allowed to send some UDP packets, in some cases
    packets from the same SOCKS client that should have been blocked
    were allowed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 20 12:44:04 CEST 2010 - ro@suse.de

- FIXME: could add upnp support if we had a miniupnp package from
  http://miniupnp.free.fr

- update to 1.2.2
  o Fix PAM bug introduced in v1.2.0 that would leak resources when
    using PAM.  Also relax the code handling PAM concerning
    unknown msg_styles.
  o Set PAM_RUSER so that rhosts-based PAM authentication can work.
  o Wrapper for calling getsockopt(2) with SO_ERROR added.
 
- update to 1.2.1
  o GSSAPI support is no longer disabled on heimdal versions older than
    0.8.0, which have no wrap/unwrap support for aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
    The following krb5.conf configuration might be needed to ensure that
    AES-256 is not used:
     default_etypes = arcfour-hmac-md5 des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
     default_etypes_des = des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
  o Code for shutting down idle sockd processes put back and can be
    enabled again, if desired.  It is not recommended for busy servers
    however as performance may be slightly degraded.
  o Fix bug related to clients using MSG_PEEK and GSSAPI on Linux.
  o Don't print warning if accept(2) fails when started with the -N<k> option.
    When started with the -N option, it is expected that accept(2) will
    fail in 1/k of the cases.  Instead just log a debug message about it.
  o The fflush() wrapper function did not handle a NULL argument.
  o Fix libsocks upnpcleanup() linking problem when compiled without
    libminiupnpc.
  o Assert failure related to message passing on some 64-bit architectures
    fixed.
  o The capi/socks.h file was not correctly installed.
  o Compilation fixes for OpenSuse 11.1.
  o Compilation fix for config_parse.y compilation without YYDEBUG.

- update to 1.2.0
  o Improvements to client thread compatibility.  The client
    library should now be mostly threadsafe.
  o Make support for the socks 5 version described in draft-5.05 be
    configurable.  Before this was always enabled, but it breaks clients
    based on NEC socks code in some cases as they use the same bit to
    mean something completely different.
    A new option has been added to sockd.conf to enable it:
    "compatibility: draft-5.05".  Unless explicitly enabled, the Dante
    server will not use the socks 5.05 draft specification.
  o Don't leak username/passwords provided to us for local authentication
    to upstream proxy server when server-chaining.
  o Fixed a bug/oversight that imposed an artificial limit on the number
    of sockd processes that could be created, even when the load required
    more.
  o Slight improvement of configuration parsing in an attempt to avoid
    confusing non-qualified hostnames with NIC interfacenames.
  o The default connect-timeout/negotiate-timeout has been reduced from
    120 seconds to 30 seconds.  The "connecttimeout" name has also been
    deprecated in favour of "timeout.negotiate".
  o Separate iotimeouts can be set for udp and tcp clients.  The "iotimeout"
    object has also been deprecated in favour of "timeout.io".
  o New configure option: "--disable-drt-fallback".
    Used to disable the attempted automatic fallback to a direct route
    if there are no usable proxy routes.  Default is, as before,
    automatic fallback.
  o Added a new option: "udp.connectdst".  Controls whether the server
    should connect udp sockets to the destination.
    The default for this release is yes, which improves performance,
    but _may_ be incompatible with some udp-based application protocols.
    Please let us know if you experience problems with some applications
    no longer working.
  o support for GSSAPI encryption/authentication (RFC 1961) to both the socks
    server and socks client.
  o limit the range of udp-ports used between the socks-client
    and the Dante server.
  o By default, try to auto-add direct routes for all addresses on the LAN.
    To disable it, set SOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES to "no".
  o Fix bug that caused problems with certain combinations of
    bind(2)/accept(2)/close(2).
  o Fix bug that erroneously blocked the bind request from some clients.
  o Add support for environment variables SOCKS4_SERVER, SOCKS5_SERVER,
    HTTP_PROXY, and UPNP_IGD.
    If set, they specify the socks v4, socks v5 server, http proxy,
    or UPNP-enabled ID to use, without the need for a socks.conf.
    This should make it possible to run socksify with reasonable results
    even without a socks.conf, as long as one of these new environment
    variables are set correctly.
  o Auto-add direct routes for all gateways.  Should make the client
    a little more user-friendly by not having to specify "direct" routes
    for the proxyserver any longer.
  o More finegrained marking of when to mark a proxy route as "bad" so that
    it will not be used again by the same client.
    Also add a new variable to config.h, MAX_ROUTE_FAILS, determining
    how many times a route can fail before being blacklisted.  Default
    is one (same semantics as before there was a variable to control this).
  o Fix bug that could prevent password authentication from working
    on some systems.
  o Add configure option --without-glibc-secure, which disables check for
    the glibc variable __libc_enable_secure. Creates undesired dependencies
    for packaging.
  o New getifaddrs() compatibility function, taken from heimdal-1.2.1.
  o Support for interfacenames in sockd rules, and in the destination
    address for socks routes.
    Should make it easier to set up direct routes for local lan in
    the client (specify all local interfacenames in route statements),
    and block connections to e.g. loopback addresses (specify the the
    loopback interfacename in a block rule) in the server.
  o UPnP support in the client, using the miniupnp library by
    Thomas Bernard (http://miniupnp.free.fr/).
    UPnP is a protocol implemented by many home/small-business routers
    and adsl-modems.  It allows you to dynamically open up ports on
    the router for accepting incoming connections, as well as figuring
    out what the external ipaddress of the router is.
    Dante uses this to make socksify of ftp/bittorent/etc programs
    work via the UPnP router.
    Note that only the miniupnp library with releasedate 2009/09/21
    or later is expected to work with Dante.
  o Be less strict about bind in the client.  The standards says
    it is expected that the client first performs a connect via
    the socks server, but it seems some/many socks servers support
    the client requesting a bind without a previous connect, so we
    assume that is the case in the client from now on.
  o Changed the magic bytes that indicate the client is requesting
    use of the Dante-specific bind extension from 0x00000000 to
    0xffffffff, as part of the process to become less strict about
    the bind command requiring a previous connection.
  o Don't zero password in client if we read it from environment, or
    it will not work the next time the same clientprocess tries to
    authenticate to the server.
  o Add support for "group:" syntax to rules, similar to "user:" statement.
  o Close connection to PAM server each time we get an error-reply from
    it, fixing a bug.
  o Incorrect assert fixed.
  o Log close of client-rule with correct command.
