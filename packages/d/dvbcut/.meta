  <title>Qt application for cutting parts out of DVB streams</title>
  <description>DVBcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an MPEG
transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and save
these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a `keyhole surgery''
approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept unchanged, and
only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the selected range are re-
encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.
