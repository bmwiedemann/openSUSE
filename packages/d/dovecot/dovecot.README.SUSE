SSL support in dovecot:
-----------------------

SSL is disabled pr. default, to enable create an SSL certificate, and modify
the dovecot configuration file accordingly.

The easiest way to generate certificates is editing

"/usr/share/doc/packages/dovecot/dovecot-openssl.cnf"

and running

"/usr/share/doc/packages/dovecot/mkcert.sh"

to create the needed SSL certificate. afterwards set "ssl_disable"
in "/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf" to "no".

*This only affects 13.1 and newer as well as SLE 12 and newer:*

In the past mkcert.sh create certificates into

/etc/ssl/certs/dovecot.pem
/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem

The script and documentation is now patched to use the following paths:

/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.crt
/etc/ssl/private/dovecot.pem

/etc/ssl/certs/ is maintained by p11kit on newer distros and should not
be used for service certificates. For your own certificate authority
certificates either create your own ca-certificates-yourname package or
install them into /etc/pki/trust/anchors/ and run
update-ca-certificates.

This documentation is provided for older distributions so you can
prepare your system before upgrading to the newer distros.

Modules location:
-----------------

Since the libexec dir is /usr/lib(64) when conforming to FHS as SUSE LINUX
does, the modules should go to /usr/lib(64)/dovecot/modules/{imap,pop3}.


Configuration:
--------------
Since SLE12 there is no cyrus-imap support. The new imap server is dovecot.

Changes in autoyast.
<postfix_mda> may have following values: "local" | "procmail"

There is no yast support for dovecot configuration.

If you want to deliver local mails to dovecot follow this steps:
1. Set MAIL_CREATE_CONFIG to "no" in /etc/sysconfig/mail to prohibit yast2 to override your configuration.
2. Set mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -f "$SENDER" -a "$RECIPIENT" in /etc/postfix/main.cf
3. Set mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir or to your prefered value in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
4. Set a normal user as alias for root in /etc/aliases
5. Execute following comands:
   postalias /etc/aliases
   systemctl restart postfix
   systemctl enable dovecot
   systemctl start dovecot

Apparmor-related issues
-----------------------

There is an AppArmor policy in effect for all SUSE distributions limiting dovecotâ€™s behaviour. If you want to have your mail storage somewhere else than in 
~/Maildir/, ~/mail/, ~/Mail/, /var/vmail/, /var/mail/, or /var/spool/mail/ you need to edit /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/dovecot file to include appropriate directories (you always want to leave /var/mail and /var/spool/mail present).
