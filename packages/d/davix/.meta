  <title>Simple file management over HTTP-based protocols</title>
  <description>Davix aims to make file management over HTTP-based protocols simple,
focusing on high-performance remote I/O and data management of
large collections of files. Currently, there is support for the
WebDav, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and HTTP protocols.

It provides a C++ library offering an HTTP API, a remote I/O API, and
a POSIX compatibility layer. It also provides several utilities for
file transfer, large collections of files management and large files
management.
