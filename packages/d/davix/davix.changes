- Add 057b4fa188b6b8afdb34cc6b7d103c78e73c1001.patch: Upstream

    (LFS)

    bundled

Wed May  1 20:29:22 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Use system available curl and rapidjson instead of bundled
  instances. The use of system rapidjson has the nice side-effect
  of no longer failing to build against GCC14.

  code the location of rapidjson header, and allow system package
  to be used if available [gh#cern-fts/davix#119].
- Enable third-party copy program davix-cp, add BuildRequires:
  pkgconfig(gsoapssl++).
- Run tests as part of %check.
