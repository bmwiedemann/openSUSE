  * Bug fixes:
    - [DMC-1190] - Unhandled DavixException in secondary thread
      during multi-range simulation.
    - [DMC-1191] - Memory leak in function trying to detect S3
      region.
    - Recognize OpenSSL 'bad decrypt' error message as
      CredDecryptionError.
    - Fix error handling for proxy delegation.
  * [DMC-1181] - Implement proper, abstract data provider class
    for davix HttpIOChain.
  * Refactoring and improvements to davix-tester.
- Changes from version 0.7.5:
  * Bug fixes:
    - Enable use of dav:// and davs:// in third party copies.
    - Fix third party copies when the server presents multiple
      certificate delegation endpoints.
    - Prevent davix from infinite-looping when the server abruptly
      terminates the connection during TPC.
  * Add ability to cancel ongoing TPC transfers through
    user-supplied callback.
  * Continued refactoring to eventually allow the use of libcurl
    as HTTP backend in davix.
  * In-source builds are no longer supported, and explicitly
    prevented by CMake.
- Minor updates to patches using quilt to apply cleanly (only line
  number changes).
