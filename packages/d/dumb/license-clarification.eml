Hi,

First let me start by introducing myself, I'm a linux enthousiast / developer 
and a Fedora contributer. I maintain the dumb package for Fedora.

Currently we are doing a licensing audit of all our packages (what a pain) 
because of the coming of GPL version 3.

During this audit the DUMB license has been held in the light too, and it has 
been deemed a non free license by the lawyers :(

The problem are the clauses 4 and 5, the lawyers see this as non free "as it 
imposes absurd restrictions of use on the users of the software". I noticed in 
the Debina package that you've given Debian permission to distribute dumb with 
the 4th and 5th clause removed from the license (and thus the 6th too as that 
then no longer is necessary). If you could give us permission to do the same 
that would be great.

A mail saying you will allow this is enough

Many Thanks & Regards,

Hans

Hi :)

Technically, I renounced Clause 4 for Debian, back when DUMB v0.9.2 was the 
latest version and Clauses 5 and 6 didn't exist. I had hoped 6 would solve 
the problem. I never explicitly gave permission for them to remove the jokes 
from the licence.

I had also hoped that Clause 5 wouldn't be an issue because it has the get-out 
clause "if deemed appropriate", and possibly that Clause 4 is ill-defined 
because "Program" is never defined anywhere :D but oh well.

You have my permission to add a note (I suggest above Clause 4) that Clauses 4 
and 5 (and possibly 6) do not apply to users/maintainers/whoever (whichever 
word or words fit best for you) of Fedora, but I'd appreciate it if, unlike 
Debian, you kept the text of the clauses in there for their humour value.

Is this satisfactory?

Ben

Hi,

They haven't removed the joke, see:
http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/libd/libdumb/libdumb_0.9.3-5/libdumb1.copyright

They probably never noticed the license change when upgrading to 0.9.3, but 
even with the tekst there although perhaps GPL compatible it is not a Free 
software license, because when used with non GPL software clauses 4 and 5 will 
be in effect, making it non free.

Erm, how about adding a text, that clauses 4-6 are there for humor only and are 
not part of the official license?

Adding a text that they do not apply to Fedora .... is not enough, because we 
(Fedora) want people to be able to take Fedora and do with it whatever they 
want, at which moment it could no longer be Fedora, and then the clauses would 
apply again. Think like how ubuntu is based on Debian.

Thanks & Regards,

Hans

I believe the problem was put to me at the time in terms of the GPL, so that's 
why I phrased Clause 6 the way I did. Not my fault!!

Yes, that will be acceptable. I misunderstood your requirements, sorry :)
