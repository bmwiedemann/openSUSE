- fixed failure for game to find its data files in /usr/share/games/doom64ex-plus
- removed disable-arm-asm.patch
- removed custom Makefile
- New version 4.0.0.0:
  * Migration to SDL3 with zero SDL2 fallback option, SDL2 is entirely
    deprecated and the only rendering path, is the current SDL3 preview's
  * High resolution scaled image support (similar to remaster).
    So MDOOM's, chapter interpics, LEGAL text etc.. can all be used with
    high resolution images. Only exception is the 'EVIL' interpic which
    remains scaled the same as remaster. See the EX+ wad for example dimensions
    for width x height and try not to deviate from them too much
  * Optimisations for frame timing. EX+ should now be absolutely buttery
    smooth at all times, with zero 'jitteriness'.
    Tested on an ARC A580 and no issues
  * 32bit support is deprecated entirely
  * Bunch of other stuff here and there :D
