- Packaging improvements:
  * Fix zsh-completion and fish-completion by not requiring

    completion file.

Wed Oct 18 19:10:28 UTC 2023 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- Packaging improvements:
  * Use subpackages for fish-completion and zsh-completion.
    Upstream currently has no bash completion scripts. Fish and zsh
    subpackages are marked Suggests: and not installed by default.
    If a bash-completion subpackage becomes available, we should
    install that by default.
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Remove ldflags -X entries for upstream import path and version.
    This information is embedded in binaries with go1.18+ and
    available via go version -m or runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo().
  * Remove ldflags -s (Omit symbol table and debug info) and -w
    (Omit DWARF symbol table). This information is used to produce
    separate debuginfo packages and binaries are stripped for
    reduced size by GNU strip during RPM build.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Use %%name macro where applicable to normalize common lines
    across Go app packages. Also makes renaming binary easier when
    required to handle package name conflict.
  * Remove bash loop for two paramaterized calls of go build.
    The loop technique is nice for large lists, but making the two
    go build calls explicit seems a better readability tradeoff.
  * Add sample API config as doc
