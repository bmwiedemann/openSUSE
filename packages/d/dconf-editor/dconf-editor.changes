    the --help text, various small changes, and some relocatable
    schemas added.

- Update to version 3.31.4:
  + The UI and the features should mostly stay the same now until
    the future release 3.32 (planned in March). They include a
    search running from current folder, some new keyboard shortcuts

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  3 18:36:29 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.29.90:
  + This development cycle has been quite calm (until its end), and
    that’s why there wasn’t any previous “alpha” release. The only
    visible things for users should be some new demos. But
    internally, this module can now be splitted in two, one that
    handles the UI (“frontend”) and one that plays with the dconf
    service, gsettings API, and possibly other sources of
    configuration informations to be added in the future. The goal
    is to move this “backend” as a new module –a library first, and
    then to transform it as a D-Bus service– in the next
    development cycle. There is probably at least one regression
    due to these big changes, but I will do my best to test all the
    things before 3.30 release. If you see a bug, please report.
  + Updated translations.

- Update to version 3.21.4:
  + The UI has completely evolved, into an all-in-one-window. That
