- Update to version 3.1.0:
  * New features:
    + Major code refactoring: now, platform specific code is
      clearly separated
    + Solaris support.
    + The CSV separator can be specified via the configuration file
      (defaults to",").
    + In addition to the already export formats (CSV, text, tex and
      HTML), dfc is able to export the information as JSON (no
      additional dependency required).
    + Add support for bold font via the configuration file
    + Add -M option to disable "Mounted On" information.
    + Add Dutch translation.
    + Add git revision to the dfc version string for development
      versions of dfc.
  * Bug fixes:
    + Fix type not respecting -W flag.
    + Fix alignment issue when both -M and -o options are specified.
    + Plug a few memory leaks.
    + Escape mount options with "" when exporting to CSV as mount
      options may typically contain a ",".
    + Linux: avoid stat'ing remote file system when local flag is
      given (prevents dfc from potentially hanging on remote file
      systems).
    + Consider nfs4 a remote filesystem.
    + Correctly link math library (fixes build on, at least,
      Ubuntu).
    + Remove a few extra incorrect CSV separators in CSV export
      mode.
    + Silently ignore EACCESS error on statvfs.
    + Fix build failure on Hurd.
    + Fix build failure on kFreeBSD.
  * Incompatible changes:
    + Remove "GRIM" compile option - compile flags previously set
      by "grim" are now defaults.
    + Stop translating color names in the configuration file - now,
      only "English" names are understood.
