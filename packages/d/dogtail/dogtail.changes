- Update to version 0.9.11:
  + There has been a good deal of fixes and improvements since last
    year's release. We're not really ready for 1.0 yet, which is
    why we release this important cumulative release as 0.9.10. We
    have also moved our homesite to gitlab (fedoraproject has been
    discontinued). For the list of changes, simply go to:
    https://gitlab.com/dogtail/dogtail/commits/master

- Update Url.
- Adjust %build and BuildRequires to use python 3.
