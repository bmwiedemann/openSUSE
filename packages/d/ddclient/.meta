  <title>A Perl Client to Update Dynamic DNS Entries</title>
  <description>ddclient is a small full-featured client requiring only Perl. Supported
features include daemon operation, manual and automatic updates, static
and dynamic updates, optimized updates for multiple addresses, MX, wild
cards, abuse avoidance, retry for failed updates, and status updates to
syslog and through e-mail. ddclient can obtain the IP address from any
interface, through a Web-based IP detection service, and for multiple
routers using custom FW definitions. It also provides full support for
DynDNS.org's NIC2 protocol. Support is also included for other dynamic
DNS services. Comes with sample scripts for use with DHCP, PPP, and
cron.</description>
