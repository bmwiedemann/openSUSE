  <title>Tools to Create and Apply deltarpms</title>
  <description>This package contains tools to create and apply deltarpms. A deltarpm
contains the difference between an old and a new version of an RPM,
which makes it possible to recreate the new RPM from the deltarpm and
the old one. You do not need to have a copy of the old RPM, because
deltarpms can also work with installed RPMs.</description>
