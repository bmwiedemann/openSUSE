%description
A set of tools to perform basic audits on DNS requests and responses
to make sure DNS is working as expected. Dnsping can be used to
measure the response time of a given DNS server for arbitrary
requests. Just like a traditional ping utility, it provides similar
functionality for DNS requests.

Dnstraceroute can be used to trace the path a DNS request takes to
its destination. Its purpose is to detect whether a request is
redirected or hijacked. This can be done by comparing different DNS
queries being sent to the same DNS server using dnstraceroute and
observe if there is any difference between the path.

dnseval evaluates multiple DNS resolvers and helps choosing the best
DNS server for the network. It is recommended to use one's own DNS
resolver as opposed to a third-party DNS server. dnseval can compare
different DNS servers from a performance (latency) and reliability
(loss) point of view for when DNS forwarders need to be used instead
of a resolver.
