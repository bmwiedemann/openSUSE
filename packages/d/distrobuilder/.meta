  <description>distrobuilder is an image building tool for LXC and LXD/Incus.

The image definition is a YAML document which describes the source of the image, its package manager, what packages to install/remove for specific image variants, os releases and architectures, as well as additional files to generate and arbitrary actions to execute as part of the image build process.

The output is either a plain root filesystem, a LXD/Incus image or a LXC image.</description>
