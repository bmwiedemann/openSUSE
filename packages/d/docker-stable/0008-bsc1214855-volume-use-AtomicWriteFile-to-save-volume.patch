Subject: [PATCH 08/13] bsc1214855: volume: use AtomicWriteFile to save volume
 options

If the system (or Docker) crashes while saivng the volume options, on
restart the daemon will error out when trying to read the options file
because it doesn't contain valid JSON.

In such a crash scenario, the new volume will be treated as though it
has the default options configuration. This is not ideal, but volumes
created on very old Docker versions (pre-1.11[1], circa 2016) do not
have opts.json and so doing some kind of cleanup when loading the volume
store (even if we take care to only delete empty volumes) could delete
existing volumes carried over from very old Docker versions that users
would not expect to disappear.

Ultimately, if a user creates a volume and the system crashes, a volume
that has the wrong config is better than Docker not being able to start.

[1]: commit b05b2370757d ("Support mount opts for `local` volume driver")
