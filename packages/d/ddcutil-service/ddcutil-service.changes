- 1.0.14 
  - A hotplug and DPMS tidy up to accommodate quirks exhibited by drivers, GPUs and monitors.   
  - Default to libddcutil event detection for libddcutil >= 2.2 (for faster response to changes).
  - Add option --prefer-libddcutil-events as a better name for deprecated option --prefer-drm.
  - Deprecate option --prefer-drm as it's name is misleading.
  - Add option --disable-connectivity-signals to allow connectivity signals to be turned off.
  - Add options --disable-hotplug-polling and --disable-dpms-polling to accommodate quirky monitors.
  - Always internally poll for DPMS changes (DPMS is not covered by libddcutil events).
  - Add method ListDetected to take advantage of hotplug detection in libddcutil >= 2.2.
  - Add the list command to ddcutil-client to provide access to the new ListDetected method.
  - Add wait, wait-connection-change, and wait-vcp-change commands to ddcutil-client.
  - Log more information when get_vcp fails.

Wed Nov 27 19:36:37 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.12
  - Return the error status-code if enable_ddca_watch_displays fails - was returning OK even on failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 01:18:47 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.11
  - Alter the detect-function for ddcutil 2.5.1 (generates more logging/warning info).
  - Add a DETECT_ALL option to control whether disabled/powered-off VDU's are to be included in the results from detect.
  - Reduce the number of messages generated when polling for hotplug events.
  - Fixes to API documentation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 13 23:04:48 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.9
  - Fixed a GetCapabilitiesMetadata bug that caused some VCP features to lack metadata values.
  - Fixed the return of feature-name and feature-description from GetVcpMetadata.
  - Fixed potential hot-plug/DPMS polling memory leaks and simplified event locking.
  - Recoded hot-plug/DPMS polling to avoid a potential libddcutil assertion failure.
  - Fixed code/doc typos, improved code readability/structure, reduced IDE warnings.
  - Updated documentation to caution against excessive updates when coding loops, as this may impact VDU NVRAM lifespan.
  - Updated documentation to caution against experimenting with non-standard features, as it may risk damage to the VDU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 16 00:25:06 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.7
  - Slightly improved setvcp diagnostics.
  - Fix methods failing with return code DDCRC_OTHER (-3022) when only some i2c devices are accessible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 03:52:43 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.6
  - Add SetVcp/SetVcpWithContext NO_VERIFY (no retry) flag option.
  - Match the behaviour of the ddcutil command, default to verify-and-retry for all set-vcp method calls.
  - Default to verify-and-retry for all libddcutil versions.
  - Replace the stateful DdcutilVerifySetVcp property with the stateless NO_VERIFY flag.
  - Fix the ServiceFlagOptions property so that it lists all flag options.
  - Check the status returned by libddcutil ddca_init() and exit on error to prevent any inconsistent behaviour.
  - Cleanup the --prefer-polling and --prefer-drm options to make them consistent with each other. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 12 22:50:44 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.4
  - Provide an API flag RETURN_RAW_VALUES which disables GetVcp high-byte masking of Simple Non-Continuous features.
  - Provide the --return-raw-values command line option for the same purpose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 18:07:41 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- 1.0.3
  - Reduce unnecessary logging.
  - Improve the description of the service's signals in ddcutil-service.1.
  - Correct the typo in option name --perfer-drm (it was mistakenly called --prefer-dma).
  - For simple VCP-features, only return the low-byte, for some VDUs the high-byte might contain junk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 29 06:37:06 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 1.0.2
  - Added VcpValueChanged D-Bus signal which triggers if the SetVcp method succeeds. This is to allow
    multiple clients to be aware of changes made by each.
  - Added SetVcpWithContext which accepts a client-context to be returned with the VcpValueChanged signal.
  - ServiceEmitSignals renamed to ServiceEmitConnectivitySignals to avoid confusion.
  - Command line option --emit-signals renamed to --emit-connectivity-signals for the same reason.
  - Fix ServiceEmitSignals property assignment so that it correctly toggles hotplug signals.
  - Fix hotplug polling so that it remains an option no matter what version of libddcutil is in use. 
- Version 1.0.1
  - Use gcc with -Wformat-security for safety and to match Arch and Ubuntu defaults.
  - Calling ddca_init() before verify_i2c() to fix runtime error for libddcutil >= 2.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 18 21:15:00 UTC 2024 - Michael Hamilton <michael@actrix.gen.nz>

- Version 1.0.0
  * Added an optional D-Bus interface to ddcutil for up 10x faster response times.
