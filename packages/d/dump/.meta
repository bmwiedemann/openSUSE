<package name="dump" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>A Backup Program</title>
  <description>The dump package contains both dump and restore.  Dump examines files
in a file system, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage medium. 
The restore command performs the inverse function of dump. It can
restore a full backup of a file system.</description>
