Subject: [PATCH 1/6] SECRETS: SUSE: always clear our internal secrets

In the future SUSEConnect support patch, we will add swarm secrets with
the ID suse_* containing credentials pertinent to SUSEConnect.
Unfortunately, secret references (but not the secrets themselves) are
persisted in the container configuration.

Our secrets patch would clear old secrets to avoid having duplicates
(see bsc#1057743) but now that SLE16 will no longer use this patch,
containers migrated to the new system will fail to start because the
secret store is not initialised (and the secret reference IDs don't
exist anyway).

The solution is to always clear any secrets with the suse_* prefix, and
this patch will be applied to all builds (even those with SUSEConnect
support disabled).

THIS PATCH IS NOT TO BE UPSTREAMED, DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS
SUSE-SPECIFIC, AND UPSTREAM DOES NOT APPROVE OF THIS CONCEPT BECAUSE IT
MAKES BUILDS NOT ENTIRELY REPRODUCIBLE.
