- Update to Docker 19.03.12-ce. See upstream changelog in the packaged

  spurrious errors due to Go returning -EINTR from I/O syscalls much more often
  (due to Go 1.14's pre-emptive goroutine support).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  5 10:58:07 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- Add a patch to dynamically probe whether libdevmapper supports
  dm_task_deferred_remove. This is necessary because we build the containers
  module on a SLE12 base, but later SLE versions have libdevmapper support.
  This should not affect openSUSE, as all openSUSE versions have a new enough
  libdevmapper. Backport of https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/35518.

  backport into the SLE package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 30 10:15:20 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- Include secrets fix to handle "old" containers that have orphaned secret
  data. It's not clear why Docker caches these secrets, but fix the problem by
  trashing the references manually. bsc#1057743
  * secrets-0002-SUSE-implement-SUSE-container-secrets.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 23 13:48:08 UTC 2017 - rbrown@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 14 22:39:56 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- Remove migration code for the v1.9.x -> v1.10.x migration. This has been
  around for a while, and we no longer support migrating from such an old
  version "nicely". Docker still has migration code that will run on
  first-boot, we are merely removing all of the "nice" warnings which tell
  users how to avoid issues during an upgrade that ocurred more than a year
  ago.
- Drop un-needed files:
  - docker-plugin-message.txt
  - docker-update-message.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 16:47:01 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- Add a backport of https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/35424, which fixes a

- Correctly set `docker version` information, including the version, git
  commit, and SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH (requires a backport). This should
  *effectively* make Docker builds reproducible, with minimal cost. boo#1064781

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 16 11:06:22 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

Mon Oct  2 08:12:17 UTC 2017 - vrothberg@suse.com

- Fix bsc#1059011

  The systemd service helper script used a timeout of 60 seconds to
  start the daemon, which is insufficient in cases where the daemon
  takes longer to start. Instead, set the service type from 'simple' to
  'notify' and remove the now superfluous helper script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 27 15:04:19 UTC 2017 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- fix bsc#1057743: Add a Requires: fix_bsc_1057743 which is provided by the
  newer version of docker-libnetwork. This is necessary because of a versioning

- devicemapper: add patch to make the dm storage driver remove a container's
  rootfs mountpoint before attempting to do libdm operations on it. This helps
  avoid complications when live mounts will leak into containers. Backport of
  https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/34573. bsc#1045628

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 30 14:58:52 UTC 2017 - asarai@suse.com

- Fix a regression in our SUSE secrets patches, which caused the copied files
  to not carry the correct {uid,gid} mapping when using user namespaces. This
  would not cause any bugs (SUSEConnect does the right thing anyway) but it's
  possible some programs would not treat the files correctly. This is
  tangentially related to bsc#1055676.

- Fix (bsc#1032644)

  Change lvm2 from Requires to Recommends

  Docker usually uses a default storage driver, when it's not configured
  explicitly. This default driver then depends on the underlying
  system and gets chosen during installation.

		* Docker Content Trust now requests the server to perform snapshot signing ([#21046](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/21046))
		* Support for using YubiKeys for Content Trust signing has been moved out of experimental ([#21591](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/21591))

	* Volumes
		* Output of `docker volume ls` is now sorted by volume name ([#20389](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/20389))
		* Local volumes can now accepts options similar to the unix `mount` tool ([#20262](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/20262))
		- Fix an issue where one letter directory name could not be used as source for volumes ([#21106](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/21106))
		+ `docker run -v` now accepts a new flag `nocopy`. This tell the runtime not to copy the container path content into the volume (which is the default behavior) ([#21223](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/21223))

detailed changelog in

https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/590d5108bbdaabb05af590f76c9757daceb6d02e/CHANGELOG.md

- removed patches, because code has been merged in 1.10.0 release:
    libcontainer-apparmor-fixes.patch: see: https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/release/v1.10/contrib/apparmor/template.go
    fix_bnc_958255.patch: see https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/2b4f64e59018c21aacbf311d5c774dd5521b5352
    use_fs_cgroups_by_default.patch
    fix_cgroup.parent_path_sanitisation.patch
    add_bolt_ppc64.patch
    add_bolt_arm64.patch
    add_bolt_s390x.patch

- remove gcc-go-build-static-libgo.patch: This has been replace by gcc-go-patches.patch

- removed patches, because arm and ppc are not build using the dynbinary target, but the dyngccgo one:
    docker_remove_journald_to_fix_dynbinary_build_on_arm.patch
    docker_remove_journald_to_fix_dynbinary_build_on_powerpc.patch
    docker_remove_journald_to_fix_dynbinary_build_on_arm64.patch

- added patches:
    fix_platform_type_arm.patch: fix build for arm64 and aarch64: set utsname as uint8 for arm64 and aarch64
    gcc5_socket_workaround.patch: gcc5-go in Tumbleweed includes this commit
        https://github.com/golang/gofrontend/commit/a850225433a66a58613c22185c3b09626f5545eb
      Which "fixes" the data type for RawSockaddr.Data
      However, docker now expects the "wrong" data type, since docker had a workaround
      for that issue.
      Thus, we need to workaround the workaround in tumbleweed
    netlink_gcc_go.patch: add constants for syscalls TUNSETIFF and TUNSETPERSIST to fix a gcc issue.
      This is a workaround for bnc#964468: gcc-go can no longer compile Docker.
    fix-apparmor.patch: fix https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20269 . It affects SLE12 which has apparmor
      version 2.8 and not openSUSE which has version 2.9.
    fix-ppc64le.patch: Build netlink driver using int8 and not uint8 for the data structure


- reviewed patches:
    ignore-dockerinit-checksum.patch: review context in patch
    fix-docker-init.patch: review patch because build method has been changed in spec file for gcc-go
    gcc-go-patches.patch: review context in patch

- Build requires go >= 1.5: For version 1.9, we could use Go 1.4.3
    see GO_VERSION https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/release/v1.9/Dockerfile
  However, for version 1.10, we need go 1.5.3
    see GO_VERSION https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/release/v1.10/Dockerfile

- Changed docker-mount-secrets.patch: allow removal of containers
  even when the entry point failed. bnc#954797

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 12:36:25 UTC 2015 - msabate@suse.com

- Fixed the format of the fix_libsecomp_error_bnc_950931 patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 12:30:22 UTC 2015 - msabate@suse.com

- Merged the fix_libsecomp_error_bnc_950931.patch and the
  fix_x86_build_removing_empty_file_jump_amd_64.patch patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  3 10:39:27 UTC 2015 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Fix build for x86_64. Patch fix_libsecomp_error_bnc_950931.patch
  had created and empty file jump_amd64.go instead of removing it.
  This broke the build for x86_64.
  This commit fixes it by removing that empty file.

  fix_x86_build_removing_empty_file_jump_amd_64.patch: patch that
  removes empty file jump_amd64.go

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 15:49:48 UTC 2015 - msabate@suse.com

- Added patch that fixes a known gcc-go for ppc64xe in the syscall.RawSockAddr
  type.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 29 14:17:32 UTC 2015 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Add patches for fixing ppc64le build (bnc#950931)

  fix_libsecomp_error_bnc_950931.patch
  fix_incompatible_assignment_error_bnc_950931.patch
  docker_missing_ppc64le_netlink_linux_files.patch

- Remove docker_rename_jump_amd64_as_jump_linux.patch because it clashes
  with the previous patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 22 12:11:14 UTC 2015 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Exclude libgo as a requirement. The auto requires script was adding
  libgo as a requirement when building with gcc-go which was wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 15:43:46 UTC 2015 - jmassaguerpla@suse.com

- Add patch for missing systemcall for s390x. See

  https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/eecf6cd48cf7c48f00aa8261cf431c87084161ae

  add_missing_syscall_for_s390x.patch: contains the patch

- Exclude s390x for sle12 because it hangs when running go. It works for sle12sp1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 11 13:59:01 UTC 2015 - fcastelli@suse.com

 - Updated to 1.5.0 (2015-02-10):
  * Builder:
    - Dockerfile to use for a given `docker build` can be specified with
      the `-f` flag
    - Dockerfile and .dockerignore files can be themselves excluded as part
      of the .dockerignore file, thus preventing modifications to these files
      invalidating ADD or COPY instructions cache
    - ADD and COPY instructions accept relative paths
    - Dockerfile `FROM scratch` instruction is now interpreted as a no-base
      specifier
    - Improve performance when exposing a large number of ports
  * Hack:
    - Allow client-side only integration tests for Windows
    - Include docker-py integration tests against Docker daemon as part of our
      test suites
  * Packaging:
    - Support for the new version of the registry HTTP API
    - Speed up `docker push` for images with a majority of already existing
      layers
    - Fixed contacting a private registry through a proxy
  * Remote API:
    - A new endpoint will stream live container resource metrics and can be
      accessed with the `docker stats` command
    - Containers can be renamed using the new `rename` endpoint and the
      associated `docker rename` command
    - Container `inspect` endpoint show the ID of `exec` commands running in
      this container
    - Container `inspect` endpoint show the number of times Docker
      auto-restarted the container
    - New types of event can be streamed by the `events` endpoint: ‘OOM’
      (container died with out of memory), ‘exec_create’, and ‘exec_start'
    - Fixed returned string fields which hold numeric characters incorrectly
      omitting surrounding double quotes
  * Runtime:
    - Docker daemon has full IPv6 support
    - The `docker run` command can take the `--pid=host` flag to use the host
      PID namespace, which makes it possible for example to debug host processes
      using containerized debugging tools
    - The `docker run` command can take the `--read-only` flag to make the
      container’s root filesystem mounted as readonly, which can be used in
      combination with volumes to force a container’s processes to only write to
      locations that will be persisted
    - Container total memory usage can be limited for `docker run` using the
      `—memory-swap` flag
    - Major stability improvements for devicemapper storage driver
    - Better integration with host system: containers will reflect changes
      to the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` file when restarted
    - Better integration with host system: per-container iptable rules are moved
      to the DOCKER chain
    - Fixed container exiting on out of memory to return an invalid exit code
  * Other:
    - The HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables are
      properly taken into account by the client when connecting to the
      Docker daemon

Wed Feb 19 08:35:27 UTC 2014 - fcastelli@suse.com

 - updated to Docker 0.8.1
    * Builder:
      - Avoid extra mount/unmount during build. This removes an unneeded
        mount/unmount operation which was causing problems with devicemapper
      - Fix regression with ADD of tar files. This stops Docker from
        decompressing tarballs added via ADD from the local file system
      - Add error to `docker build --rm`. This adds a missing error check to
        ensure failures to remove containers are detected and reported
    * Remote API:
      - Fix broken images API for version less than 1.7
      - Use the right encoding for all API endpoints which return JSON
      - Move remote api client to api/
      - Queue calls to the API using generic socket wait

      - Refactor the devicemapper code to avoid many mount/unmount race
        conditions and failures
      - Remove two panics which could make Docker crash in some situations
      - Don't ping registry from the CLI client
      - Enable skip_block_zeroing for devicemapper. This stops devicemapper from
        always zeroing entire blocks
      - Fix --run in `docker commit`. This makes docker commit store `--run`
        in the image configuration
      - Remove directory when removing devicemapper device. This cleans up
        leftover mount directories
      - Drop NET_ADMIN capability for non-privileged containers. Unprivileged
        containers can't change their network configuration
      - Ensure `docker cp` stream is closed properly
      - Avoid extra mount/unmount during container registration. This removes
        an unneeded mount/unmount operation which was causing problems with
        devicemapper
      - Stop allowing tcp:// as a default tcp bin address which binds to
        127.0.0.1:4243 and remove the default port
      - Mount-bind the PTY as container console. This allows tmux and screen to
        run in a container
      - Clean up archive closing. This fixes and improves archive handling
      - Fix engine tests on systems where temp directories are symlinked
      - Add test methods for save and load

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 13 09:07:39 UTC 2014 - fcastelli@suse.com

- Ensure lxc >= 1.0 is not installed on the system, this version is
  not compatible with docker yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 08:48:22 UTC 2014 - fcastelli@suse.com

- updated to docker 0.8.0:
  * Images and containers can be removed much faster
  * Building an image from source with docker build is now much faster
  * The Docker daemon starts and stops much faster
  * The memory footprint of many common operations has been reduced, by
    streaming files instead of buffering them in memory, fixing memory leaks,
    and fixing various suboptimal memory allocations
  * Several race conditions were fixed, making Docker more stable under very
    high concurrency load. This makes Docker more stable and less likely to
    crash and reduces the memory footprint of many common operations
  * All packaging operations are now built on the Go language’s standard tar
    implementation, which is bundled with Docker itself. This makes packaging
    more portable across host distributions, and solves several issues caused
    by quirks and incompatibilities between different distributions of tar
  * Docker can now create, remove and modify larger numbers of containers and
    images graciously thanks to more aggressive releasing of system resources.
    For example the storage driver API now allows Docker to do reference
    counting on mounts created by the drivers.  With the ongoing changes to the
    networking and execution subsystems of docker testing these areas have been
    a focus of the refactoring.  By moving these subsystems into separate
    packages we can test, analyze, and monitor coverage and quality of these
    packages
  * The Docker daemon supports systemd socket activation
  * Docker now ships with an experimental storage driver which uses the BTRFS
    filesystem for copy-on-write
  * The ADD instruction now supports caching, which avoids unnecessarily
    re-uploading the same source content again and again when it hasn’t changed
  * The new ONBUILD instruction adds to your image a “trigger” instruction to be
    executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another
    build
  * Many components have been separated into smaller sub-packages, each with a
    dedicated test suite. As a result the code is better-tested, more readable
    and easier to change
  * Docker is officially supported on Mac OSX

-------------------------------------------------------------------

        variable to address this issue.
      * install udev rules inside of /usr/lib/udev as requested by rpmlint.
