%description
diskimage-builder is a tool for automatically building customized
operating-system images for use in clouds and other environments.

It includes support for building images based on many major
distributions and can produce cloud-images in all common formats
(qcow2, vhd, raw, etc), bare metal file-system images and ram-disk
images. These images are composed from the many included elements;
diskimage-builder acts as a framework to easily add your own elements
for even further customization.
