  <title>Device-tree compiler</title>
  <description>PowerPC kernels are moving towards requiring a small Open
Firmware-style device tree as the only means of passing information
from bootloaders/firmware to the kernel. This does not require a full
Open Firmware implementation. DTC (Device Tree Compiler) is a tool to
create a static device tree, which is adequate for most embedded
systems (since their topology will not vary across reboots). DTC is
available via a git tree: git://ozlabs.org/srv/projects/dtc/dtc.git</description>
