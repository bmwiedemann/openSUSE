# The rpmlint warning is:
#   dwz-testsuite.nosrc: W: invalid-spec-name
#   The spec file name (without the .spec suffix) must match the package name
#   ("Name:" tag). Either rename your package or the specfile.
# This seems to be a multibuild artifact.  The package name is dwz-testsuite,
# but the specfile filename is dwz.spec.  The only way we can fix this is by
# reverting to a two-specfile setup.
# 
# FTR, the warning comes paired with these grep failures in the "Preparing
# packages log":
# ... testing for empty debuginfo packages
# grep: SOURCES/dwz-testsuite.spec: No such file or directory
# ... running 50-check-filelist
#   ...
# ... testing devel dependencies required by libtool .la files
# grep: SOURCES/dwz-testsuite.spec: No such file or directory
#      (can be skipped by "skip-check-libtool-deps" anywhere in spec)
# ... running 50-check-packaged-twice
#
# So, skip the rpmlint warning.  This doesn't fix the grep fails.
