%description
dwz optimizes DWARF debugging information contained in ELF shared
libraries and executables for size, by replacing DWARF information
representation with equivalent smaller representation where possible,
and by reducing the amount of duplication using techniques from the
DWARF standard appendix E - creating DW_TAG_partial_unit compilation
units (CUs) for duplicated information and using DW_TAG_imported_unit
to import it into each CU that needs it.

The tool handles DWARF 32-bit format debugging sections of versions
2, 3 and 4 and GNU extensions on top of those, though using DWARF 4
or worst case DWARF 3 is strongly recommended.

When not using the -m option (multifile mode), GDB CVS snapshot (soon to be
7.5) is sufficient, when using -m option, GDB from a git branch
http://sources.redhat.com/git/?p=archer.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/archer-tromey-dwz-multifile
is needed.
