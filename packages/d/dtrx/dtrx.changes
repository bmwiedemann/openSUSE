- Update to version 7.1:
  + New features: LZH archives are now supported.
  + Bug fixes:
    - dtrx will no longer offer to extract the zero archive files
      found in a zero-file archive.
    - Temporary directories will be cleaned up after extracting an
      empty archive.
- Changes from version 7.0:
  + At this point, I consider dtrx to be mature software. It's
    maybe a little too interactive, but otherwise it does
    everything I want, and it does it very well.  Expect new
    releases to be few and far between going forward.
  + New features: If any of dtrx's command line arguments are URLs,
    it will automatically download them with `wget -c` in the
    current directory before extracting them.
  + Enhancements:
    - dtrx will try to extract ZIP files with 7z if unzip is not
      successful.
    - dtrx will be smarter about removing extensions from filenames
      when extracting to a new directory or file.
    - dtrx will not ask you if you want to recurse through an
      archive if the number of archives inside the original file is
      small.
- Changes from version 6.6:
  + Enhancements: dtrx can now handle `xz compression`_.
  + Other changes: The tests now use the PyYAML library, instead of
    the abandoned Syck.
- Changes from version 6.5:    
  + Enhancements:
    - When you list archive contents with -l or -t, dtrx will start
      printing results much faster than it used to.  There's a
      small chance that it will print some incorrect listings if it
      misdetects the archive type of a given file, but it will show
      you an error message when that happens.
    - dtrx recognizes more kinds of compressed tar archives by 
      their extension.
    - You can now extract newer .deb packages that are compressed
      with bzip2 or lzma.
   + Bug fixes:
     - When extracting an archive that contained a file with a
       mismatched filename, the prompt would offer you a chance to
       "rename the directory" instead of "rename the file." This
       wording has been fixed, along with some other wording
       adjustments in the prompts generally.
     - Perform more reliable detection of the terminal size, and
       improve word wrapping on prompts.
   + Other changes : The README is now written like a man page, and
     can be converted to a man page by using rst2man_.
- Changes from version 6.4:
  + Enhancements:
    - Support detection of LZMA archives by magic.
    - Interactive prompts are wrapped much more cleanly.
  + Bug fixes: Fix a bug where dtrx would crash when extracting an
    archive with no files inside it.
- Add BuildArch: norach for opensuse.

* Mon Oct 20 2008 Pascal Bleser <guru@unixtech.be> 6.3
- update to 6.3:
  * this release adds support for RAR archives
  * fixes a bug that caused dtrx to crash when extracting certain kinds of
    archives with the -v option
  * avoids spurious warnings under Python 2.6

* Mon Jul 28 2008 Pascal Bleser <guru@unixtech.be> 6.2
- new upstream version:
  * new --one-entry option
  * fixes "1234 blocks" warning message
  * when you try to list the contents of an archive, dtrx will now cope with
    misnamed files more gracefully, giving more accurate results and showing
    fewer error messages
  * dtrx 6.2 will only show you error messages from archive extraction if it
    is completely unable to extract the file. If one of its extraction methods
    succeeds, it will no longer show you the error messages from previous
    extraction attempts
  * dtrx is now better about cleaning up partially extracted archives when it
    encounters an error or signal
  * users will no longer see error messages about broken pipes from dtrx.

* Tue Jul 15 2008 Pascal Bleser <guru@unixtech.be> 6.1
- new upstream version:
  * add support for InstallShield archives, using the unshield command
  * the wording of many of the interactive prompts has been adjusted to be
    clearer and provide more information to the user immediately
  * dtrx 6.1 does a better job protecting against race conditions when
    extracting a single file
  * if you used the -f option, and extracted an archive that only contained
    one file or directory, dtrx 6.0 would still prompt you to ask how it
    should be extracted. dtrx 6.1 fixes this, extracting the contents to the
    current directory as -f requires
  * recursive extraction would not work well in dtrx 6.0 when the contents of
    the original archive were a single file. This has been fixed in dtrx 6.1.

* Sat Mar  8 2008 Pascal Bleser <guru@unixtech.be> 6.0
