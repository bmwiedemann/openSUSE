  <title>Intelligent Archive Extraction Tool</title>
  <description>dtrx stands for &quot;Do The Right Extraction.&quot; It's a tool for Unix-like systems
that takes all the hassle out of extracting archives.

dtrx is simple and powerful. Just use the same command for all your archive
files, and they'll never frustrate you again.

Features:
* Handles many archive types: You only need to remember one simple command to
  extract tar, zip, cpio, deb, rpm, gem, 7z, cab, gz, bz2, and lzma files. If
  they have any extra compression, like tar.bz2, dtrx will take care of that
  for you, too.
* Keeps everything organized: dtrx will make sure that archives are extracted
  into their own dedicated directories.
* Sane permissions: dtrx makes sure you can read and write all the files you
  just extracted, while leaving the rest of the permissions intact.
* Recursive extraction: dtrx can find archives inside the archive and extract
  those too.
