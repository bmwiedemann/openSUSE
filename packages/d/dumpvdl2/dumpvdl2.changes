Fri Jan 18 23:54:00 UTC 2019 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.6.0
  * New build system based on cmake.
  * FANS/1-A CPDLC, ADS-C and ACARS decoders have been removed.
    These features have been moved to libacars library, which is
    now a mandatory dependency
  * Added support for SoapySDR library. However there are still
    some limitations with respect to SDR types which dumpvdl2
    can work with. As of now, the device must support a sampling
    rate of 2100000 samples per second. This will be addressed in
    a future release.
  * Minor bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 18 18:51:58 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Sync with the latest SDRPlay API v. 2.13 which is now required
    to compile the program.
  * Added support for SDRPlay RSPduo (with tuner selection, bias-T
    and notch filters).
  * Added support for RSP1A features: Bias-T and broadcast notch
    filter.
  * Minor bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  1 19:35:17 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.4.0
  * Major improvements to the DSP and decoding engine - gives much
    better decoding success rate, especially for weak transmissions
    from distant aircraft.
  * Each VDL2 channel is now processed in a separate thread, which
    allows balancing the load onto multiple CPU cores.
  * Fixed a nasty decoder bug which caused good frames to be
    corrupted during decoding stage and therefore missed.
  * Added CRC checking for ACARS messages. If there is a CRC
    mismatch, the message will still be logged, but with an
    appropriate warning.
  * New StatsD metric avlc.msg.air2air - counts messages from
    aircraft to aircraft (however strange it seems, such things
    happen in real life).
  * New StatsD metric decoder.errors.too_long - counts VDL2 bursts
    dropped due to unreasonably large value in the length field.
  * Due to changes in the decoding engine, the following StatsD
    metric are now obsolete and have been removed:
    avlc.errors.no_flag_start, avlc.errors.no_flag_end,
    decoder.errors.no_preamble.
  * Added --extended-header command line option which causes a few
    decoder diagnostic parameters to be logged for each message.
    Refer to the FAQ in README.md for description of the fields.
  * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
  * C11-capable compiler is now required to build the program.

Fri Jun  1 19:53:27 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.3.1
  * Added decpdlc utility which decodes FANS-1/A CPDLC messages
    supplied from command line or from a file. Can be used to
    decode CPDLC traffic received via other media than VDL-2
    (eg. ACARS, HFDL, SATCOM). Refer to "decpdlc" section in
    README.md for details

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 11 20:31:31 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.3.0
  * Added decoder for FANS-1/A ADS-C messages
  * Added decoder for FANS-1/A CPDLC messages
  * Human-readable formatting of CPDLC and Context Management
    messages (if you still want the old format, add --dump-asn1
    command line option)
  * Added install rule to Makefile
  * Added a sample systemd service file
  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  1 12:12:40 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.2.0
  * Better input signal filtering - reduced bit error rate, 10-50% more
    messages successfully decoded.
  * SDRPlay: major bugfixes in sample buffer handling code - shall now
    perform equally well as RTLSDR (or even better).
  * SDRPlay: --gain knob replaced with --gr (gain reduction). This makes
    gain configuration in dumpvdl2 compatible with other SDRPlay apps.
    See README.md for details.
  * SDRPlay: support for selecting device by serial number.
    Added optional build-time PLATFORM knob which sets CPU-specific
  * compiler flags to optimize the code for various flavours of
    Raspberry Pi. Supported values: rpiv1, rpiv2, rpiv3.
  * Other minor bug fixes
- Remove patch:
  * dumpvdl2-obey-cflags.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 20 20:30:49 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.1.0
  * Support for SDRPlay RSP1 and 2 using native binary API
  * Added dissector for ISO 8073/X.224 Connection-oriented Transport Protocol
  * Added dissectors for ICAO Context Management and CPDLC
  * Enhancements for ES-IS and XID dissectors
  * Support for referring to dongles using their serial numbers
  * Output formatting fixes
  * Bug fixes
- Rebase patch:
  * dumpvdl2-obey-cflags.diff
