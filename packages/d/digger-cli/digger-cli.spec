%description
CI/CD for Terraform is tricky. To make life easier, specialised CI systems aka
TACOS exist - Terraform Cloud, Spacelift, Atlantis, etc.

But why have 2 CI systems? Why not reuse the async jobs infrastructure with
compute, orchestration, logs, etc of your existing CI?

Digger runs terraform natively in your CI. This is:

* Secure, because cloud access secrets aren't shared with a third-party
* Cost-effective, because you are not paying for additional compute just to run
  your terraform

Features

* Terraform plan and apply in pull request comments
* Private runners - thanks to the fact that there are no separate runners! Your
  existing CI's compute environment is used
* Open Policy Agent (OPA) support for RBAC
* PR-level locks (on top of Terraform native state locks, similar to Atlantis)
  to avoid race conditions across multiple PRs
* Terragrunt, Workspaces, multiple Terraform versions, static analysis via
  Checkov, plan persistence, ...
* Drift detection

This package contains the digger CLI.
