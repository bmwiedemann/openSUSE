- Update to version 1.1.3: 
    This is a bugfix release that includes only three minor improvements: a
    direct-key signature (0x1f) for the primary key is added by default such
    that restricting key servers (e.g. keys.openpgp.org) can deliver a
    cryptographically checkable key without verification of any included
    user ID or without appended subkey. The command line interface of
    dkg-decrypt has been improved in order to give users an easy access to
    the symmetric-key decryption mode. An additional option ("-5") for
    dkg-sign allows to generate V5 signatures (cf. draft RFC 4880bis).

- Update to version 1.1.2:
    This release adds a lot of features to some programs: two new options
    ("-K" and "-f") allow dkg-keysign to read the certification key from a
    keyring instead of a single key block file. Moreover, with option "-a"
    an interactive confirmation by the user is required for each signature.
    Passive support of V5 keys (cf. draft RFC 4880bis) has been added for
    all programs, however, dkg-generate still generates V4 keys only,
    because this new feature of the draft is not widely spread. There is
    also a new encryption capability: an empty KEYSPEC tells dkg-encrypt to
    create a symmetric-key encrypted session key, i.e., the user has to
    supply a passphrase for encryption and decryption without any public-key
    cryptography involved. Last but not least, two bugs have been fixed:
    First, dkg-decrypt failed on many ZIP-compressed OpenPGP messages with 
    "ZLIB ERROR: -3 invalid block type" due to a bug in decompression logic.
    Second, dkg-decrypt failed in a special case of symmetric-key encrypted
    session keys. Finally, the non-installing program dkg-fuzzer (generates
    fuzzy samples of somehow corrupted OpenPGP stuctures) has been added.

- Update to version 1.1.1:
    Some small improvements have been applied for dkg-generate: Two new
    options ("-u" and "-N") allow providing the initial user ID and to
    disable the passphrase at command line. Moreover, since this release
    dkg-timestamp and dkg-timestamp-verify require a special key usage flag
    from recent RFC 4880bis draft to select so-called timestamping keys.
    Finally, the synchronization time of the internally used broadcast
    protocol was reduced to a more reasonable amount and in dkg-decrypt the
    detection of end of data for message and decryption shares was changed.

- Update to version 1.1.0:
    This release supports Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
    in accordance to RFC 4880bis (draft); this can be enforced with the new
    added option "-a" when  dkg-(d)encrypt is used. For using domain parameters,
    as described in RFC 7919, one should specify the new option "-r", when
    dkg-gencrs is used. Last, for key generation (dkg-generate) the timestamp
    option was added ( "--timestamping") which sets a key usage flag.

Mon Nov 12 07:52:43 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.0.9
    This release improves the possibilities of DKGPG further. With the new
    programs dkg-adduid and dkg-revuid an user ID can be added and revoked,
    respectively. The program dkg-revoke now supports a human-readable
    reason for revocation (by option "-R") and dkg-decrypt verifies an
    included signature according to a given key ring (option "-k"). Last
    but not least, by the program dkg-addrevoker an external revocation
    key can be specified.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 13 07:13:51 UTC 2018 - Karol Babioch <kbabioch@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.0.8:
    First of all, passive support for ECDSA, ECDH, and EdDSA (cf. RFC 6637
    and Werner Koch's draft RFC 4880bis) has been added by relying on the
    most recent version of LibTMCG. The threshold signature scheme and the
    threshold encryption are still limited to finite field cryptography
    (i.e. DSA and ElGamal). Moreover, the programs generate and recognize
    a few other new OpenPGP features (e.g. issuer fingerprint subpackets)
    from RFC 4880bis. Compressed messages are now decompressed by the
    program dkg-decrypt using zlib Compression Library (and optionally by
    library routines from libbzip2). This completes DKGPG's compatibility
    with other OpenPGP software, however, the prefered compression algorithm
    (i.e. "no compression") in self-signatures of generated keys is kept
    for now. Support for symmetric-key decryption by dkg-decrypt has been
    added too. The program dkg-verify now reads the signature from a file,
    if option "-s" is used. To keep track of later protocol changes, all
    interactive programs include a version identifier in their common ID of
    the reliable broadcast channel. Thus programs from previous releases
    will not communicate with those of this release. With the new programs
    dkg-timestamp and dkg-timestamp-verify a OpenPGP timestamp signature
    can be generated and verified, respectively. Last but not least, by the
    new option "-y" some programs (dkg-generate, dkg-decrypt, dkg-sign,
    dkg-keysign, and dkg-timestamp) will work with regular OpenPGP keys too.
    The README file contains a configuration sample showing how to replace
    classic PGP by DKGPG in the famous mail user agent mutt based on this
    option. Please note that this feature is experimental and semantics
    may be changed later.
