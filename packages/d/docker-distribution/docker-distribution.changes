-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 14 07:45:10 UTC 2016 - msabate@suse.com

- Upgraded to 2.4.0. Changelog:

* New S3 storage driver

The default s3 storage driver is now implemented on top of the official Amazon
S3 SDK, boasting major performance and stability goodness. The previous storage
is still available, but deprecated.

* Garbage Collector

A garbage collector tool has been added to the registry. For more details see
the garbage collector documentation.

* Tagged Manifest Events

Manifest push and pull events will now include the tag which was used in the
operation (if applicable).

* Relative URLs

The registry can now be configured to return relative URLs in Location headers.

* V1 Signature disabled

With the ongoing adoption of the schema 2 manifest format and deprecation of
signatures, this option will improve pull performance by generating and
returning a single libtrust signature.

* Gotchas

The RADOS storage driver has been removed. The registry can still be used with
Ceph as the storage backend using the swift driver in conjunction with the
Swift API gateway.

The command line format has changed to support subcommands. To run a registry
as before an additional subcommand - serve - is required.

The legacy S3 storage driver, based on adroll/goamz is now deprecated and will
be removed in a future release.
