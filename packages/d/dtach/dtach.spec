%description
dtach wraps a command in a sort of process container with new
terminal device and session, allowing to "detach" from it,
essentially backgrounding the process, and later re-attach to it,
similar to the eponymous feature of GNU screen.

dtach avoids interpreting most of the input and output between attached
terminals and the program under its control. Though multi display mode (like
screen -x) is available, different terminal types or even sizes are not
handled.
