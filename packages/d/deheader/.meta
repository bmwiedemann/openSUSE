  <title>Find and optionally remove unneeded includes in C or C++ sourcefiles</title>
  <description>deheader analyzes C and C++ files to determine which header inclusions can be
removed while still allowing them to compile. This may result in substantial
improvements in compilation time, especially on large C++ projects; it also
sometimes exposes dependencies and cohesions of which developers were unaware.</description>
