- Drop the "serial" flavour and build the no-mpi package for
  flavor = "".
- Fix build failures for openSUSE >= 1550 by not undefining
  "suffix" any more.
- Pass wrapped_mpi=ON to cmake to tell the build scripts that the
  MPI compiler wrapper requires no further MPI libraries; this
  fixes failing tests in %check.
- Use %cmake macro to configure; export compiler and env variables
  before calling cmake where possible instead of passing them as
  cmake options.
