    <comment>- Update to 1.5.2:
* Gamma and Brightness are now applied in the shaders instead of
  by setting hardware gamma.  Can be disabled (so hardware gamma
  is used again) with `r_gammaInShaders 0`
* Cycle through multiple Quicksave slots instead of immediately
  overwriting the last Quicksave. The `com_numQuicksaves` CVar
  allows setting the number of QuickSaves
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#392)
* Make r_locksurfaces work
  It doesn't do exactly what its description and name suggests:
  it renders everything that is *currently* visible from the
  position/view the player had when setting `r_locksurfaces 1`.
  Originally it was supposed to render exactly the surfaces that
  *were* visible then, but I couldn't get that to work.
  This is pretty similar, but there may be differences with opened
  doors and such.
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#357)
* Keyboard input improvements (mostly SDL2-only):
  - Support (hopefully) all keyboard keys on all kinds of keyboard
    layouts by using scancodes for otherwise unknown keys
  - Support typing in non-ASCII characters, if supported by Doom3
    (it supports ISO-8859-1)
  - Support the clipboard also on non-Windows platforms
    You can paste text from the clipboard into the console or
    other edit fields with `Shift+Insert`
  - Explicit support for Right Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys
    (can be bound to different actions than their left
    counterparts)
  - Added `in_grabKeyboard` CVar to make sure dhewm3 gets *all*
    keyboard input</comment>
