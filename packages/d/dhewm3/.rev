    <version>1.5.2</version>

    <comment>- Update to 1.5.2:
* Gamma and Brightness are now applied in the shaders instead of
  by setting hardware gamma.  Can be disabled (so hardware gamma
  is used again) with `r_gammaInShaders 0`
* Cycle through multiple Quicksave slots instead of immediately
  overwriting the last Quicksave. The `com_numQuicksaves` CVar
  allows setting the number of QuickSaves
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#392)
* Make r_locksurfaces work
  It doesn't do exactly what its description and name suggests:
  it renders everything that is *currently* visible from the
  position/view the player had when setting `r_locksurfaces 1`.
  Originally it was supposed to render exactly the surfaces that
  *were* visible then, but I couldn't get that to work.
  This is pretty similar, but there may be differences with opened
  doors and such.
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#357)
* Keyboard input improvements (mostly SDL2-only):
  - Support (hopefully) all keyboard keys on all kinds of keyboard
    layouts by using scancodes for otherwise unknown keys
  - Support typing in non-ASCII characters, if supported by Doom3
    (it supports ISO-8859-1)
  - Support the clipboard also on non-Windows platforms
    You can paste text from the clipboard into the console or
    other edit fields with `Shift+Insert`
  - Explicit support for Right Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys
    (can be bound to different actions than their left
    counterparts)
  - Added `in_grabKeyboard` CVar to make sure dhewm3 gets *all*
    keyboard input</comment>

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.5.3
  * Support for gamepads. See Configuration.md for more information.
  * Support different file formats for screenshots by setting the
    r_screenshotFormat CVar (0 = TGA, still the default, 1 = BMP,
    2 = PNG, 3 = JPG). r_screenshotJpgQuality and
    r_screenshotPngCompression allow configuring how JPG/PNG are
    compressed.
  * Fixed problems with lights after loading a savegame.
  * Fix volume of some weapon sounds, like chaingun being too quit.
  * Fix MD3 model support
  * Several new CMake options:
    + To enable Clang/GCC Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior
      Sanitizer
    + Hardlink the game code into the executable (instead of using
       game DLLs, only supports base or d3xp then; needed for
       Undefined Behavior Sanitizer)
    + Force colored diagnostic output from GCC or Clang (esp.
      useful when building with ninja)
  * Fix several compiler warnings
  * Updated stb_image and stb_vorbis
  * Updated minizip (from zlib/contrib) to latest upstream code
  * Added in_namePressed CVar to print currently pressed key/button
    (useful for binding keys in the console or configs).
- Add patch
  * dhewm3-fix-desktop-files.patch
- Packages desktop files
- Adjust URL
