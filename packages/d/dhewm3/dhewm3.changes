- Update to 1.5.2:
* Gamma and Brightness are now applied in the shaders instead of
  by setting hardware gamma.  Can be disabled (so hardware gamma
  is used again) with `r_gammaInShaders 0`
* Cycle through multiple Quicksave slots instead of immediately
  overwriting the last Quicksave. The `com_numQuicksaves` CVar
  allows setting the number of QuickSaves
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#392)
* Make r_locksurfaces work
  It doesn't do exactly what its description and name suggests:
  it renders everything that is *currently* visible from the
  position/view the player had when setting `r_locksurfaces 1`.
  Originally it was supposed to render exactly the surfaces that
  *were* visible then, but I couldn't get that to work.
  This is pretty similar, but there may be differences with opened
  doors and such.
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#357)
* Keyboard input improvements (mostly SDL2-only):
  - Support (hopefully) all keyboard keys on all kinds of keyboard
    layouts by using scancodes for otherwise unknown keys
  - Support typing in non-ASCII characters, if supported by Doom3
    (it supports ISO-8859-1)
  - Support the clipboard also on non-Windows platforms
    You can paste text from the clipboard into the console or
    other edit fields with `Shift+Insert`
  - Explicit support for Right Ctrl, Alt and Shift keys
    (can be bound to different actions than their left
    counterparts)
  - Added `in_grabKeyboard` CVar to make sure dhewm3 gets *all*
    keyboard input
    Prevents the Windows-key or Alt-Tab or whatever from taking
    focus from the game
  - Added `in_ignoreConsoleKey` - if set to `1`, the console is
    only opened with Shift+Esc, and the "console key" (that key
    between Esc, 1 and Tab) can be freely bound to an action
    (and its char can be typed in the console without closing
    it).
  - Added (SDL2-only) "auto" option for `in_kbd`: When not
    disabling the console key, dhewm3 will try to automatically
    detect it if `in_kbd` is set to "auto" (now default)
* Reworked mouse-input and -grabbing code, using absolute mouse
  mode in fullscreen GUIs (except for the PDA, because it's
  implemented weirdly).
  This made releasing the mouse in the main menu possible, as now
  the ingame cursor is at the same position as the system cursor.
* `s_alReverbGain` CVar to reduce EFX reverb effect intensity
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#365)
* Pause (looped) sounds when entering menu
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#330)
* Fixes for looped sounds
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#390)
* Replace libjpeg with stb_image and libogg/libvorbis(file) with
  stb_vorbis
  - Now the only required external dependencies should be OpenAL,
    SDL, zlib and optionally libCURL (and of course the C and C++
    runtimes)
* (Optionally) use libbacktrace on non-Windows platforms for more
  useful backtraces in case of crashes (usually linked statically)
* Fixed endless loop (game locking up at startup) if graphics
  settings couldn't be applied
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#386)
* Fixed some warnings and uninitialized variables
* Work around dmap bug caused by GCC using FMA "optimizations"
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#147)
* Prevent dhewm3 from being run as root on Unix-like systems to
  improve security
* Replaced most usages of `strncpy()` with something safer to
  prevent buffer overflows (remaining cases should be safe).
* Console output is now logged to `dhewm3log.txt`
  (last log is renamed to `dhewm3log-old.txt`)
  - On Windows it's in `My Documents/My Games/dhewm3/`
  - On Mac it's in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/dhewm3/`
  - On other Unix-like systems like Linux it's in
    `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dhewm3/` (usually `$HOME/.local/share/dhewm3/`)
* Improved compatibility with Wayland
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#426)
* Work around assertion in AlphaLabs4 due to "ride_of_death"
  yeeting the dead "monster_zsec_shotgun_12" into the void
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#409)
* Support loading some mods known to need `fs_game_base d3xp` via
  Mods menu (currently, *The Lost Mission* and *LibreCoop d3xp*
  are supported)
* Disable assertion in idSampleDecoderLocal::DecodeOGG() that
  triggered when starting a new Classic Doom3 game
  (gh#dhewm/dhewm3#461)

Sun Mar 14 10:09:33 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to 1.5.1:
  * Update savegame format. Old savegames still work, but new
    savegames can't be loaded with older versions of dhewm3!
  * dhewm3 now supports the Doom3 Demo gamedata.
  * Create the game window on the display the cursor is currently
    on (when using more than one display).
  * Added r_fullscreenDesktop CVar to set if fullscreen mode should
    be "classic" or "Desktop" which means a borderless window at.
    desktop resolution.
  * Fullscreen modes that are not at the current desktop resolution
    should work better now.
  * Several sound-related bugfixes.
  * Restore "Carmack's Reverse" Z-Fail stencil shadows; use
    glStencilOpSeparate() if available.
  * New CVar g_hitEffect: If set to 0, the player camera damage
    effects (like double-vision and extreme tilt) when being hit
    are disabled.
  * Fix lingering messages in HUD after loading savegame.
  * Fixed clipping bug in delta1.
  * Improve compatibility with some custom scripts.
  * Registering multiplayer servers at id's master-server fixed,
    so they can be found in the multiplayer menu.
  * Support for reproducible builds by setting the CMake option
    REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD.
  * Proper handling of paths with dots in directory names.
  * In the Spanish translation all the Alpha Lab autosaves got
    the same name, now the autosave name is based on the mapename
    instead which is distinct.
- Remove patch
  * 0001-Remove-use-of-date-time-macros.patch (fixed by upstream)
