-  Update to version 0.79.6
  * Verify/Test option will now output dvdisaster version numbers
    always in x.yy.zz format, as the old scheme using x.yy
    (devel|pre|rc|pl)-zz is no longer used.
  * The "medium info" tool will now correctly show the blank
    capacity (was previously always shown as zero)	
  * added support for BDXL-TL (triple layer, 100GB)
  * Sector CRC sums and the image MD5 sum are collected during
    reading the medium and can be re-used by the ecc data creation
    process. Speeds up ecc generation and enables RS03 image
    checksums when generating ecc data was preceeded by a read.
- cleanup spec file with spec-cleaner
- rebase dvdisaster-findmake.patch
- add upstream urls to sources
- add pgp signature
