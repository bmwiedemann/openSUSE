Thu Oct 17 19:12:57 UTC 2019 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 2.2:
  + Implement grouping for batch commands new separators are []
    (square brackets) or groupIn/groupOut command 'backup'
    translates now to [pre_bkp_post] to be skipped as one block in
    case a condition was set in the batch instruction.
- Changes from version 2.1:
  + Be more verbose when duplicity version detection fails.
  + Using info shows python binary's path for easier
    identification now.
  + Reworked python interpreter handling, it's either configured
    per PYTHON var unconfigured, parsed from duplicity shebang or
    set to current duplicity default 'python2' (was 'python' until
    now).
  + Donot quotewrap strings because of slashes (eg. paths) anymore.
  + Bugfix: improved in/exclude stripping from conf DUPL_PARAMS.
- Remove obsolete Groups tag (fate#326485).

  + Bugfix 114: "duply usage is not current" wrt. purgeFull/Incr.
  + Bugfix 115: typo in error message - "Not GPG_KEY entries"
    should be "No".
  + Bugfix 117: no duply_ prefix when ARCH_DIR is set in conf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  8 20:09:42 UTC 2017 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.2:
  * Bugfix: never insert creds into file:// targets.
  * Bugfix: avail profiles hint sometimes shortend the names by one
    char.
  * Bugfix 108: CMD_NEXT variable should ignore conditional commands
    (and, or).
  * Export condition before/after next/prev command as
    CND_PREV,CND_NEXT now.
  * Bugfix 97: Unknown command should be ERROR, not WARNING.
- Changes from version 2.0.1:
  * Bugfix 104: Duply 2.0 sets wrong archive dir, --name was always
    'duply_'.
- Changes from version 2.0:
  * Made this a major version change, as we broke backward
    compatibility anyway. If your backend stops working w/ this
    version create a new profile and export the env vars needed as
    described in the comments of the conf file directly above the
    SOURCE setting.
  * Making sure multi spaces in TARGET survive awk processing.
  * New env var PROFILE exported to scripts.
  * Fix 102: expose a unique timestamp variable for pre/post scripts
    actually a featreq. exporting RUN_START nanosec unix timestamp.
  * Fix 101: GPG_AGENT_INFO is 'bogus'.
  * Fix 96: duply cannot handle two consecutive spaces in paths.
- Update Copyright year.

Mon Sep 26 01:42:40 UTC 2016 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.11.3:
  + Fix wrong "WARNING: No running gpg-agent ..." when sign key was
    not set.
- Changes from version 1.11.2:
  + Fix "gpg: unsafe" version print out.
  + Bugfix 91: v1.11 [r47] broke asymmetric encryption when using
    GPG_KEYS_ENC.
  + Bugfix 90: S3: TARGET_USER/PASS have no effect, added
    additional documentation about needed env vars to template
    conf file.
- Changes from version 1.11.1:
  + Reverted duply's default PYTHON to 'python'.
- Changes from version 1.11:
  + Remove obsolete --ssh-askpass routine.
  + Add PYTHON conf var to allow global override of used python
    interpreter.
  + Enforced usage of "python2" in PATH as default interpreter for
    internal use _and_ to run duplicity (setup.py changed the 
    shebang to the fixed path /usr/bin/python until 0.7.05, which
    we circumvent this way).
  + Feature 36: Support gpg-connect-agent as a means to detect if
    an agent is running, used gpg-agent for detection though.
  + Quotewrapped run_cmd parameters to protect it from spaces eg.
    in TMP path.
  + Key export routine respects gpg-agent usage now.
- Update copyright year.
- Add ChangeLog to package.

- Update to version 1.10.1:
  + Bugfix 86: Duply+Swift outputs warning.
  + Bugfix 87: Swift fails without BACKEND_URL.
- Changes from 1.10:
  + Featreq 36: busybox issues - fix awk, grep version detection,
    fix grep failure because --color=never switch is unsupported.
  + Bugfix 81: --exclude-globbing-filelist is deprecated since
    0.7.03.
  + Implemented base-/dirname as bash functions.
  + Featreq 31 " Support for duplicity Azure backend " - ignored a
    contributed patch by Scott McKenzie and instead opted for
    removing almost all code that deals with special env vars
    required by backends. Adding and modifying these results in too
    much overhead so I dropped this feature. The future alternative
    for users is to consult the duplicity manpage and add the
    needed export definitions to the conf file. Appended a
    commented example to the template conf below the auth section.
- Changes from 1.9.2:
  + Bugfix: exporting keys with gpg2.1 works now.
  + Documented GPG_OPTS needed for gpg2.1 to conf template.
  + Bugfix 82: GREP_OPTIONS=--color=always disrupted time
    calculation.
  + Added GPG conf var (see conf template for details).
  + Added grep version output as it is an integral needed binary.
  + Added PYTHONPATH printout in version output.
- Changes from 1.9.1:
  + Export CMD_ERR now for scripts to detect if CMD_PREV
    failed/succeeded.
  + Bugfix: CMD_PREV contained command even if it was skipped.
- Changes from 1.9.0:
  + Bugfix: env vars were not exported when external script was
    executable.
  + Rework GPG_KEY handling, allow virtually anything now (uid,
    keyid etc.) see gpg manpage, section "How to specify a user ID"
    let gpg complain when the delivered values are invalid for
    whatever reason.
  + Started to rework tmp space checking, exposed folder & writable
    check. TODO: reimplement enough file space available checking.
- Changes from 1.8.0:
  + Add command verifyPath to expose 'verify --file-to-restore'
    action.
  + Add time parameter support to verify command.
  + Add section time formats to usage output.

  + bugfix: purge-* commands renamed to purgeFull, purgeIncr due to 
    incompatibility with new minus batch separator

  + featreq 7 "Halt if precondition fails":
    added and(+), or(-) batch command(separator) support

    if a script is flagged executable it's executed in a subshell 
    now as opposed to sourced to bash, which is the default
  + bugfix: do not check if dpbx, swift credentials are set anymore 
  + bugfix: properly escape profile name, archdir if used as arguments
  + add DUPL_PRECMD conf setting for use with e.g. trickle
