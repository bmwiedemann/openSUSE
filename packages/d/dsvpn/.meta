  <title>A Dead Simple VPN</title>
  <description>DSVPN is a Dead Simple VPN, designed to address the most common
use case for using a VPN:

[client device] -- (untrusted network) -- [vpn server] -- [the Internet]

Features:
 * Runs on TCP. Works pretty much everywhere, including on public WiFi
   where only TCP/443 is open or reliable.
 * Uses only modern cryptography, with formally verified implementations.
 * Small and constant memory footprint. Doesn't perform any heap memory
   allocations.
 * Small (~25 KB), with an equally small and readable code base.
 * Works out of the box. No lousy documentation to read. No configuration
   file. No post-configuration. Run a single-line command on the server,
   a similar one on the client and you're done.
   No firewall and routing rules to manually mess with.
 * Doesn't leak between reconnects if the network doesn't change.
   Blocks IPv6 on the client to prevent IPv6 leaks.
