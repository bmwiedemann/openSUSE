  <title>Graphical viewer for GNU ddrescue mapfiles</title>
  <description>This small tool allows the user to graphically examine ddrescue's map files in a user friendly GUI application. The Main window displays a block grid with each block's color representing the block types it contains. Many people know this type of view from defragmentation programs.
