    <comment>- remove use-getters-for-fields-in-other-classes.patch, integrated upstream.
- remove pie.patch, setting -fPIE does not work anymore.
- remove ddrescueview.desktop, upstream has a desktop file.
- update to version 0.4 apha 4:
 - Updated to compile on FPC 3.2.0 without errors. Thanks to Peter Green for the patch.
 - It's now possible to select a range on the Zoom Bar using right click dragging, just like on the Block Grid.
 - Added an option in the Settings to zoom in on mouse position without centering the Block Grid on that position.
     This is now the default. It seems more intuitive when the blocks previously under the mouse 
     stay under the mouse after zooming in or out.
 - Added an Option 'Center on Current Position' to the View menu, which keeps the Block Grid centered on the 
     current rescue position. Handy to keep the rescue position on screen when zoomed in. 
     This overrides much of the usual zooming functionality and deactivates interaction with the Zoom Bar.
 - Zooming and scrolling in large map files is now considerably faster.
 - Application title (as reported to the OS, for the task bar etc.) now shows loaded file name.
 - The program will now make a second attempt to refresh the mapfile, when ddrescue is currently rewriting it.
 - New application icon in multiple sizes up to 256x256
 - Reduced compiler warnings and hints
