Subject: [PATCH 1/2] crm-fence-peer.9.sh: fix parsing in_ccm crmd fields of
 node_state with Pacemaker 2.1.7

If pacemaker version < 2.1.7, in_ccm of node_state is "true" or "false"
and crmd is "online" or "offline".

pacemaker 2.1.7 changed the two fields into timestamps.
For in_ccm, the value is timestamp since when node has been a cluster
member("true"). A value 0 of means the node is not a cluster member("false").
For crmd, the value is timestamp since when peer has been online in
CPG("online"). A value 0 means the peer is offline in CPG("offline").

The original code doesn't handle these fields in timestamp format.
Since there are many comprare of strings in context, converting in_ccm and crmd
from timestamps/0 to old strings is simpler and clearer.
