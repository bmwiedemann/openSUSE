    <comment>- use packaged dnscrypt-resolvers.csv
- fix systemd macros
- upgrade to 1.9.5, shortened upstream changelog:
 * Cache plugin: fix the way items are moved from recent to frequent lists
 * In addition to making the cache work as expected, this prevents
  `CacheEntry` items from becoming orphans.
 * Cache plugin: fix the way items are moved from recent to frequent lists
 * In addition to making the cache work as expected, this prevents
   `CacheEntry` items from becoming orphans.
 * Adding Babylon Network resolvers (#647)
 * Update resolvers list
 * Reset the reachability of nameservers if all are unreachable (#609)
 * If all nameservers have been marked unreachable, they will not be queried
 * again until dnscrypt-proxy is restarted. This fix allows for queries to be
 * retried without restarting dnscrypt-proxy.
 * Doc error: client-pk is the client' public key. Spotted by @willnix Fixes #603
 * Whitelist some TLDs typically used on local networks
 * Normalize the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv format
 * ldns-blocking: fix another corner case with suffix matching
       
       Ruleset:
       ```
       *.example.com
       ru.example.com
       ```
       
       A query for `xru.example.com` would find `ru.example.com` as the longest
       suffix. The expression didn't match since this is neither an exact match
       nor a match that stops at a label.
       
       However, this was ignoring the fact that there a different, shorter rule
       could match.
       
       This is pretty annoying, as keeping our promise to log the longest match
       means that we need at least yet another lookup in that specific case.
       Alternatively, the fpst lookup function could be specialized to stop at
       labels, but that would defeat the point of this example plugin. So,
       perform an extra lookup after striping the first (last, once the name is
       reversed) label.
  * Added pidfile
- specfile fixes, cleanup
- update version 1.9.4
  * The resolver name can be set to 'random' in order to pick a
    random resolver.
  * changelog for older releases see github/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy 
- use upstream configuration instead
- drop /etc/sysconfig/dnscrypt-proxy, it can'be used in instantiated
  services, now instantiated services should be started with
  &quot;sudo systemctl start dnscrypt-proxy@config.service&quot;, the switch
  from IP:Port to Config is because we need not only the IP:Port
  customizable, but also the DNSCRYPT_RESOLVER_NAME, to start multi-
  instances. (boo#977946)
- add /etc/dnscrypt-proxy.conf.d directory for configurations.
- switched to systemd template service. in the future, users
  should use 'sudo systemctl start dnscrypt-proxy@127.0.0.1:53.service'
  to start the service. any local address can be used.
- dropped dnscrypt-proxy.socket again. the listen address in the
  socket can't be substituted at runtime that makes it impossible
  to use multiple instances. and it doesn't work together with
  the forking method in our systemd service.
- move pidfile and logfile into their own directories. in previous
  submit, we finnaly used the user 'dnscrypt' to start the job, but
  that user doesn't have write permission for /var/run and /var/log.
- dropped the /usr/sbin/dnscrypt wrapper that broke the systemd
  service from forking. we used EnvironmentFile in systemd service
  to load the user-customizable variables.
- changed /etc/sysconfig/dnscrypt to /etc/sysconfig/dnscrypt-proxy.
  deleted those plugin items that can't be loaded by systemd. users
  can use DNSCRYPT_OPTIONS to configure the plugins anyway, no need
  to keep those placeholders.
- update version 1.7.0
  * Plugins are now enabled by default.
  * New command-line option: `--ignore-timestamps` to ignore timestamps
    when performing certificate validation.
  * New command-line option: `--syslog-prefix` to add a prefix to log
    messages.
  * Certificates can now be retrieved using TCP.
  * Libevent was updated to version 2.0.23.
  * Certificates serial numbers are printed as a string if possible.
  * The list of known public resolvers was updated.
- add upstream's systemd socket, fix boo#977946 again
- fix boo#977946 &amp; boo#957003
  * use %fillup_only macro right. can't skip &quot;-n&quot;, or it'll use
    package name while sysconfig.dnscrypt-proxy doesn't exist.
- use %fillup_prereq macro
- move libraries out from -devel subpackage, it's just not right.
- don't link dnscrypt-proxy.8.gz to dnscrypt.8.gz
- don't link /sbin/service to /sbin/rcdnscrypt.
  * that method is used for backward compability w/ SysVInit service
    while /sbin/dnscrypt is a wrapper to the actual command, and
    dnscrypt is not a valid service name but dnscrypt-proxy.
* version 1.6.1:
 - Security: malformed packets could cause the OpenDNS deviceid,
   OpenDNS set-client-ip, blocking and AAAA blocking plugins to use
   uninitialized pointers, leading to a denial of service or possibly
   code execution. The vulnerable code is present since dnscrypt-proxy
   1.1.0. OpenDNS users and people using dnscrypt-proxy in order to block
   domain names and IP addresses should upgrade as soon as possible.
- add dnscrypt-resolvers.csv from git (41c6d8bb1f49a0216357)
- add dnscrypt-resolvers.csv from git (e6b4e93d07bdce39d4656c5a6)
- change default resolver to cisco (bnc#957003)
* version 1.6.0:
 - New feature: public-key based client authentication (-K), for private and
   commercial DNS services to securely authenticate the sender of a query no
   matter what the source IP address is, without altering the DNS query.
* version 1.5.0:
 - New option: -E, to use an ephemeral key pair for each query.
 - Logging to files is supported on Windows.
 - TCP FASTOPEN is now enabled on Linux.
* version 1.4.4
  - edns used by default
  - server list updated
  - various build fixes
- spec file cleanup
- update to 1.4.3
  - libevent update, including a fix for CVE-2014-6272
  - Two new public dnscrypt resolvers were added: opennic-us-wa-ns1 and
    dnscrypt.org-fr
  - d0wn servers in France IP have changed.
  - Compilation fixes.
- version 1.4.2
  - New compilation switch: --with-systemd, to enable socket activation support
    when using systemd
  - The list of public DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers was updated
  - Libevent2 updates
- add sysconfig file for more flexible configuration
- build -devel package and enable plugins
- create user dnscrypt:dnscrypt during installation
- update to 1.4.1
- update version 1.4.0
  * see https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/commits/master
- fix a hang bug in dnscrypt.service
- upstream clarify license, it's BSD.
- add systemd service.
- Version 1.2.0:
  * A pre-filter can now totally bypass the resolver and directly send a
   reply to the client.
  * A new example plugin has been shipped: ldns-aaaa-blocking. It
   directly sends an empty response to AAAA queries in order to
   significantly speed up lookups on hosts without IPv6 connectivity
   (but with clients still asking for AAAA records anyway).
  * Example plugins requiring ldns can be compiled on Windows.
  * Paths with a drive name are now recognized as absolute paths on
   Windows.

    <comment>In order to satisfy

https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/817415#comment-1258559

i created

https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/818413

to wipe out those 2 packages.

With accept of

https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/817415

this not necessary anymore?


Please consider setting 'url' and 'description' in Factory package meta file
to values of devel package (or part of it).

dnscrypt-proxy v2 differs significantly from v1.</comment>
