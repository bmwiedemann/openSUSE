- Update decker and decker-doc to version 1.39

* checking in Puppeteer
* introduce dictionary conforming to Lil
* notes about set operations
* fix description of raze-of-table
* even more weekly challenge stuff
* redefine the raze operator applied to a table to form a dictionary from the first two columns, if available.
* patch possible UB in GIF decoder
* make right-clicking with the fill tool erase (pattern 0) instead of using the fill color. In practice I've found this tremendously more useful, especially when working in transparency mask mode.
* slightly nicer test framework
* in some situations saving a deck would not necessarily reflect in-progress text editing operations.
* make dialogizer respect the hidden state of its canvas when servicing a resize.
* generalize deck.remove[] to accept widgets, removing them from whatever card they may reside within.
* Lil solutions to the codereport 'top 10' problems.
* more weekly challenge problems
* more weekly challenge puzzles
* extend the image interface with image.scale[], as a convenient chainable alternative to scaling images with image.paste[]
* fix image export from the background image of a prototype.
* allow image interfaces to be coerced (rtext.cat[] as well as internal rtext_cast()) to rtext runs containing an inline image.
* when exporting images, clip the selection to the active container bounds.
* make the 'Show Transparent' appearance of make Transparent+Invisible buttons not show an inverted background when clicked, making them less visible than ever before
* when compact sliders are at their minimum or maximum extent, visibly disable the appropriate stepper button and its highlighting behavior.
* more puzzle solutions
* correct the vx := random NN instruction in the chip8 emulator example.
* improve performance of readcsv[] by reducing unnecessary intermediate allocations.
* a more efficient implementation of l_by(), which carries out the work of the 'by' clause in lil queries.
* web-decker's random[] did not handle dicts like native-decker; they should be treated the same as lists.

- Don't strip the decker or lilt binaries
- Add decker-doc as a multibuild flavor instead of making it a separate package

- Create package at upstream version 1.37

* more weekly challenge puzzles
* correct a regression introduced in the last attempt at fixing event plumbing
* simplify and improve the consistency of the cursor info overlay
* correct prettyprinting floating-point numbers very close to whole integers
* add an 'underpaint' mode that applies to all drawing tools. Underpainting leaves any instances of pattern 1 intact; this is ideal for coloring lineart, among other things
* simplifying weekly challenge 247.2 by using the window[] helper function
