- Create package at upstream version 1.37

* more weekly challenge puzzles
* correct a regression introduced in the last attempt at fixing event plumbing
* simplify and improve the consistency of the cursor info overlay
* correct prettyprinting floating-point numbers very close to whole integers
* add an 'underpaint' mode that applies to all drawing tools. Underpainting leaves any instances of pattern 1 intact; this is ideal for coloring lineart, among other things
* simplifying weekly challenge 247.2 by using the window[] helper function
