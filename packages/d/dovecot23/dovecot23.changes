- libsodium is not strictly required, it is only required for the
  argon password scheme. This is now no longer supported on sle12

Wed Aug 12 13:57:05 UTC 2020 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- update to 2.3.11.3 and pigeonhole to 0.5.11 (boo#1174920 boo#1174922 boo#1174923)

  Dovecot 2.3.11.3
  - pop3-login: Login didn't handle commands in multiple IP packets properly.
    This mainly affected large XCLIENT commands or a large SASL initial
    response parameter in the AUTH command.
  - pop3: pop3_deleted_flag setting was broken, causing:
    Panic: file seq-range-array.c: line 472 (seq_range_array_invert):
    assertion failed: (range[count-1].seq2 <= max_seq)
  Dovecot 2.3.11.2
  - auth: Lua passdb/userdb leaks stack elements per call, eventually
    causing the stack to become too deep and crashing the auth or
    auth-worker process.
  - lib-mail: v2.3.11 regression: MIME parts not returned correctly by
    Dovecot MIME parser.
  - pop3-login: Login would fail with "Input buffer full" if the initial
    response for SASL was too long.
  Dovecot 2.3.11
  * CVE-2020-12100: Parsing mails with a large number of MIME parts could
    have resulted in excessive CPU usage or a crash due to running out of
    stack memory.
  * CVE-2020-12673: Dovecot's NTLM implementation does not correctly check
    message buffer size, which leads to reading past allocation which can
    lead to crash.
  * CVE-2020-10967: lmtp/submission: Issuing the RCPT command with an
    address that has the empty quoted string as local-part causes the lmtp
    service to crash.
  * CVE-2020-12674: Dovecot's RPA mechanism implementation accepts
    zero-length message, which leads to assert-crash later on.
  * Events: Fix inconsistency in events. See event documentation in
    https://doc.dovecot.org.
  * imap_command_finished event's cmd_name field now contains "unknown"
    for unknown commands. A new "cmd_input_name" field contains the
    command name exactly as it was sent.
  * lib-index: Renamed mail_cache_compress_* settings to mail_cache_purge_*.
    Note that these settings are mainly intended for testing and usually
    shouldn't be changed.
  * events: Renamed "index" event category to "mail-index".
  * events: service:<name> category is now using the name from
    configuration file.
  * dns-client: service dns_client was renamed to dns-client.
  * log: Prefixes generally use the service name from configuration file.
    For example dict-async service will now use
    "dict-async(pid): " log prefix instead of "dict(pid): "
  * *-login: Changed logging done by proxying to use a consistent prefix
    containing the IP address and port.
  * *-login: Changed disconnection log messages to be slightly clearer.
  + dict: Add events for dictionaries.
  + lib-index: Finish logging with events.
  + oauth2: Support local validation of JWT tokens.
  + stats: Add support for dynamic histograms and grouping. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/stats/.
  + imap: Implement RFC 8514: IMAP SAVEDATE
  + lib-index: If a long-running transaction (e.g. SORT/FETCH on a huge
    folder) adds a lot of data to dovecot.index.cache file, commit those
    changes periodically to make them visible to other concurrent sessions
    as well.
  + stats: Add OpenMetrics exporter for statistics. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/stats/openmetrics/.
  + stats: Support disabling stats-writer socket by setting
    stats_writer_socket_path="".
  - auth-worker: Process keeps slowly increasing its memory usage and
    eventually dies with "out of memory" due to reaching vsz_limit.
  - auth: Prevent potential timing attacks in authentication secret
    comparisons: OAUTH2 JWT-token HMAC, imap-urlauth token, crypt() result.
  - auth: Several auth-mechanisms allowed input to be truncated by NUL
    which can potentially lead to unintentional issues or even successful
    logins which should have failed.
  - auth: When auth policy returned a delay, auth_request_finished event
    had policy_result=ok field instead of policy_result=delayed.
  - auth: auth process crash when auth_policy_server_url is set to an
    invalid URL.
  - dict-ldap: Crash occurs if var_expand template expansion fails.
  - dict: If dict client disconnected while iteration was still running,
    dict process could have started using 100% CPU, although it was still
    handling clients.
  - doveadm: Running doveadm commands via proxying may hang, especially
    when doveadm is printing a lot of output.
  - imap: "MOVE * destfolder" goes to a loop copying the last mail to the
    destination until the imap process dies due to running out of memory.
  - imap: Running "UID MOVE 1:* Trash" on an empty folder goes to infinite
    loop.
  - imap: SEARCH doesn't support $.
  - lib-compress: Buffer over-read in zlib stream read.
  - lib-dns: If DNS lookup times out, lib-dns can cause crash in calling
    process.
  - lib-index: Fixed several bugs in dovecot.index.cache handling that
    could have caused cached data to be lost.
  - lib-index: Writing to >=1 GB dovecot.index.cache files may cause
    assert-crashes:
    Panic: file mail-index-util.c: line 37 (mail_index_uint32_to_offset):
    assertion failed: (offset < 0x40000000)
  - lib-ssl-iostream: Fix buggy OpenSSL error handling without
    assert-crashing. If there is no error available, log it as an error
    instead of crashing:
    Panic: file iostream-openssl.c: line 599 (openssl_iostream_handle_error):
    assertion failed: (errno != 0)
  - lib-ssl-iostream: ssl_key_password setting did not work.
  - submission: A segfault crash may occur when the client or server
    disconnects while a non-transaction command like NOOP or VRFY is still
    being processed.
  - virtual: Copying/moving mails with IMAP into a virtual folder assert-crashes:
    Panic: file cmd-copy.c: line 152 (fetch_and_copy): assertion failed:
    (copy_ctx->copy_count == seq_range_count(&copy_ctx->saved_uids))

  Pigeonhole 0.5.11
  * managesieve: managesieve_max_line_length setting is now a "size" type
    instead of just number of bytes. This allows using e.g. "64k" as the
    value.
  - lib-sieve: When folding white space is used in the Message-ID header,
    it is not stripped away correctly before the message ID value is used,
    causing e.g. garbled log lines at delivery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 12:04:55 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update tls 1.3 patch to allow building with tls 1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 18 14:04:52 UTC 2020 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.10.1 with security fixes for
  * CVE-2020-10957: lmtp/submission: A client can crash the server by
    sending a NOOP command with an invalid string parameter.
    (boo#1171457)
  * CVE-2020-10958: lmtp/submission: Sending many invalid or unknown
    commands can cause the server to access freed memory, which can lead
    to a server crash. (boo#1171458)
  * CVE-2020-10967: lmtp/submission: Issuing the RCPT command with an
    address that has the empty quoted string as local-part causes the
    lmtp service to crash. (boo#1171456)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 29 21:25:30 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- add allow-tls1.3-only.patch:
  Allow setting TLSv1.3 as minimum TLS version

  https://github.com/dovecot/core/pull/126

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  6 11:14:00 UTC 2020 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- update to 2.3.10 and pigeonhole to 0.5.10

  Dovecot 2.3.10
  * Disable retpoline migitations by default. These can cause severe
    performance regressions, so they should be only enabled when
    applicable.
  * IMAP MOVE now commits transactions in batches of 1000 mails. This
    helps especially with lazy_expunge when moving a lot of mails. It
    mainly avoids situations where multiple IMAP sessions are running the
    same MOVE command and duplicating the mails in the lazy_expunge folder.
    With this change there can still be some duplication, but the MOVE
    always progresses forward. Also if the MOVE fails at some point, the
    changes up to the last 1000 mails are still committed instead of
    rolled back. Note that the COPY command behavior hasn't changed,
    because it is required by IMAP standard to be an atomic operation.
  * IMAP EXPUNGE and CLOSE now expunges mails in batches of 1000 mails.
    This helps especially with lazy_expunge when expunging a lot of mails
    (e.g. millions) to make sure that the progress always moves forward
    even if the process is killed.
  * Autoexpunging now expunges mails in batches of 1000 mails. This helps
    especially with lazy_expunge when expunging a lot of mails
    (e.g. millions) to make sure that the progress always moves forward
    even if the process is killed.
  + Add tool for generating sysreport called dovecot-sysreport.
    This generates a bundle of information usually needed for support
    requests.
  + Add support for the new IMAP \Important SPECIAL-USE flag (RFC 8457).
  + Add metric { group_by } setting. This allows automatically creating
    new metrics based on the fields you want to group statistics by.
    NOTE: This feature is considered experimental and syntax is subject
    to change in future release.
  + auth: Support SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism.
  + imap: Support the new IMAP STATUS=SIZE extension.
  + Use TCP_QUICKACK to reduce latency for some TCP connections.
  + quota-status: Made the service more robust against erroneous use with
    Postfix ACL policies other than smtpd_recipient_restrictions.
  + Add "revision" field support to imap_id_send setting. Using
    "revision *" will send in IMAP ID command response the short commit
    hash of the Dovecot git source tree HEAD (same as in dovecot --version).
  + IMAP ENVELOPE includes now all addresses when there are multiple
    headers (From, To, Cc, etc.) The standard way of having multiple
    addresses is to just list them all in a single header. It's
    non-standard to have multiple headers. However, since MTAs allow these
    mails to pass through and different software may handle them in
    different ways, it's better from security point of view to show all
    the addresses.
  + Event filters now support using "field_name=" to match a field that
    doesn't exist or has an empty value. For example use "error=" to match
    only events that didn't fail.
  - acl: INBOX ACLs shouldn't apply for IMAP GETMETADATA/SETMETADATA
    commands.
  - cassandra: CASS_ERROR_SERVER_WRITE_FAILURE error should also be
    treated as "uncertain write failure".
  - dict-redis: Using quota_clone configured with dict-redis could have
    crashed when Redis responded slowly.
  - fts-solr: The XML response parser fails to parse large/chunked responses
    correctly. This leads to spurious parse errors, most notably: "Error:
    fts_solr: received invalid uid '0'".
  - imap-hibernate: Communication trouble with imap-master leads to
    segfault.
  - imap-hibernate: Unhibernation retrying wasn't working.
  - imap: Fixed auth lookup privilege problem when imap process was reused
    and user was being un-hibernated.
  - Fix potential crash when copying/moving mails within the same folder.
    This happened only when there were a lot of fields in dovecot.index.cache.
  - lib-index: Recreating dovecot.index.cache file could have crashed when
    merging bitmask fields.
  - lib-index: Using public/shared folders with INDEXPVT configured to use
    private \Seen flags, trying to search seen/unseen in an empty folder
    crashes with segfault.
  - lib-mail: Large base64-encoded mails weren't decoded properly.
    This could have affected searching/indexing mails and message snippet
    generation.
  - lib-mail: Message with only quoted text could have caused message
    snippet to ignore its 200 character limit and return the entire
    message. This was added also to dovecot.index.cache file, which
    increased disk space and memory usage unnecessarily.
    v2.3.9.2 regression (previous versions cached the quoted snippet as
    empty). In a large mail quoted text could have become wrongly added
    to the snippet, possibly mixed together with non-quoted text.
  - lib-smtp: client could have assert-crashed if STARTTLS handshake
    finished earlier than usually.
  - lib-ssl-iostream: remove -static flag for lib-ssl-iostream linking to
    prevent a compile issue.
  - lib-storage: Mailbox synchronization may have assert-crashed in some
    rare situations.
  - lib-storage: mdbox didn't preserve date.saved with dsync.
  - lib: Don't require EAI_{ADDRFAMILY,NODATA}, breaks FreeBSD
  - master: Some services could respawn unthrottled if they crash during
    startup.
  - push-notification: Do not send push_notification_finished event if
    nothing was done. This happens when mail transaction is started and
    ended with no changes.
  - quota-status: Addresses with special characters in the local part caused
    problems in the interaction between Postfix and Dovecot. Postfix sent
    its own internal representation in the recipient field, while Dovecot
    expected a valid RFC5321 mailbox address.
  - submission-login: SESSION was not correctly encoded field for the
    XCLIENT command. Particularly, a '+' character introduced by the
    session ID's Base64 encoding causes problems.
  - submission: Fix submission_max_mail_size to work correctly on 32-bit
    systems.
  - submission: Trusted connections crashed in second connection's EHLO
    if submission-login { service_count } is something else than 1 (which
    is the default).
  - submission: XCLIENT command was never used in the protocol exchange
    with the relay MTA when submission_backend_capabilities is configured,
    even when the relay MTA was properly configured to accept the XCLIENT
    command.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.10
  * imap_sieve_filter: Change result action logging to include IMAP UID
  - vacation: Addresses were compared case-sensitively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 26 12:40:54 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update dovecot-2.3.0-dont_use_etc_ssl_certs.patch: since we
  change CERTDIR to /etc/ssl/private, it is rather evil to then err
  out claiming /etc/ssl/certs would not exist. The error message
  should mention the directory it tested for.

Sat Dec 14 08:55:56 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.9.2 with security fixes:
  * CVE-2019-19722: Mails with group addresses in From or To
    fields caused crash in push notification drivers.
  * Mails with empty From/To headers can also cause crash
    in push notification drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  4 21:46:28 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.9 and pigeonhole to 0.5.9

  Dovecot 2.3.9
  * Changed several event field names for consistency and to avoid
    conflicts in parent-child event relationships:
     * SMTP server command events: Renamed "name" to "cmd_name"
     * Events inheriting from a mailbox: Renamed "name" to "mailbox"
     * Server connection events have only "remote_ip", "remote_port",
       "local_ip" and "local_port".
     * Removed duplicate "client_ip", "ip" and "port".
     * Mail storage events: Removed "service" field.
       Use "service:<name>" category instead.
     * HTTP client connection events: Renamed "host" to "dest_host" and
       "port" to "dest_port"
  * auth: Drop Postfix socketmap support. It hasn't been working
    with recent Postfix versions for a while now.
  * push-notification-lua: The "subject" field is now decoded to UTF8
    instead of kept as MIME-encoded.
  + push-notification-lua: Added new "from_address", "from_display_name",
    "to_address" and "to_display_name" fields. The display names are
    decoded to UTF8.
  + Added various new fields to existing events.
    See http://doc.dovecot.net/admin_manual/list_of_events.html
  + Add lmtp_add_received_header setting. It can be used to prevent LMTP
    from adding "Received:" headers.
  + doveadm: Support SSL/STARTTLS for proxied doveadm connections based on
    doveadm_ssl setting and proxy ssl/tls settings.
  + Log filters support now "service:<name>", which matches all events for
    the given service. It can also be used as a category.
  + lib: Use libunwind to get abort backtraces with function names
    where available.
  + lmtp: When the LMTP proxy changes the username (from passdb lookup)
    add an appropriate ORCPT parameter.
  - lmtp: Add lmtp_client_workarounds setting to implement workarounds for
    clients that send MAIL and RCPT commands with additional spaces before
    the path and for clients that omit <> brackets around the path.
    See example-config/conf.d/20-lmtp.conf.
  - lda/lmtp: Invalid MAIL FROM addresses were rejcted too aggressively.
    Now mails from addresses with unicode characters are delivered, but
    their Return-Path header will be <> instead of the given MAIL FROM
    address.
  - lmtp: The lmtp_hdr_delivery_address setting is ignored.
  - imap: imap_command_finished event's "args" and "human_args" parameters
    were always empty.
  - mbox: Seeking in zlib and bzip2 compressed input streams didn't work
    correctly.
  - imap-hibernate: Process crashed when client got destroyed while it was
    attempted to be unhibernated, and the unhibernation fails.
  - *-login: Proxying may have crashed if SSL handshake to the backend
    failed immediately. This was unlikely to happen in normal operation.
  - *-login: If TLS handshake to upstream server failed during proxying,
    login process could crash due to invalid memory access.
  - *-login: v2.3 regression: Using SASL authentication without initial
    response may have caused SSL connections to hang. This happened often
    at least with PHP's IMAP library.
  - *-login: When login processes are flooded with authentication attempts
    it starts logging errors about "Authentication server sent unknown id".
    This is still expected. However, it also caused the login process to
    disconnect from auth server and potentially log some user's password
    in the error message.
  - dict-sql: SQL prepared statements were not shared between sessions.
    This resulted in creating a lot of prepared statements, which was
    especially inefficient when using Cassandra backend with a lot of
    Cassandra nodes.
  - auth: auth_request_finished event didn't have success=yes parameter
    set for successful authentications.
  - auth: userdb dict - Trying to list users crashed.
  - submission: Service could be configured to allow anonymous
    authentication mechanism and anonymous user access.
  - LAYOUT=index: Corrupted dovecot.list.index caused folder creation to
    panic.
  - doveadm: HTTP server crashes if request target starts with double "/".
  - dsync: Remote dsync started hanging if the initial doveadm
    "dsync-server" command was sent in the same TCP packet as the
    following dsync handshake. v2.3.8 regression.
  - lib: Several "input streams" had a bug that in some rare situations
    might cause it to access freed memory. This could lead to crashes or
    corruption.
    The only currently known effect of this is that using zlib plugin with
    external mail attachments (mail_attachment_dir) could cause fetching
    the mail to return a few bytes of garbage data at the beginning of the
    header. Note that the mail wasn't saved corrupted, but fetching it
    caused corrupted mail to be sent to the client.
  - lib-storage: If a mail only has quoted content, use the quoted text
    for generating message snippet (IMAP PREVIEW) instead of returning
    empty snippet.
  - lib-storage: When vsize header was rebuilt, newly calculated message
    sizes were added to dovecot.index.cache instead of being directly
    saved into vsize records in dovecot.index.
  - lib: JSON generator was escaping UTF-8 characters unnecessarily.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.8
  + Added events for Sieve and ManageSieve, see
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#pigeonhole
  + Pigeonhole: Implement the Sieve "special-use" extension described in
    RFC 8579.
  - duplicate: Test only compared the handles which would cause
    different values to be cached as the same duplicate test. Fix to also
    compare the actual hashes.
  - imap_sieve_filter: IMAP FILTER Command had various bugs in error
    handling. Errors may have been duplicated for each email, errors
    may have been missing entirely, command tag and ERRORS/WARNINGS
    parameters were swapped.

Tue Oct  8 17:31:00 UTC 2019 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.8 and pigeonhole to 0.5.8

  Dovecot 2.3.8
  + Added mail_delivery_started and mail_delivery_finished events, see
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/ for details.
  + dsync-replication: Don't replicate users who have "noreplicate" extra
    field in userdb.
  + doveadm service status: Show total number of processes created.
  + When logging to syslog, use instance_name setting's value for the
    ident. This commonly is added as a log prefix.
  + Base64 encoding/decoding code was rewritten with additional features.
    It shouldn't cause any user visible changes.
  - v2.3.7 regression: If a folder only receives new mails without any
    other mail access, dovecot.index.log keeps growing forever and
    dovecot.index keeps being rewritten for every mail delivery.
  - dsync-replication may lose keywords after syncing mails restored from
    another replica. This only happened if the mail only had keywords and
    no system flags.
  - event filters: Non-textual event fields could not be filtered using
    wildcards.
  - auth: Scope parameter was missing from OAuth password grant
    request.
  - doveadm client-server communication may hang in some situations.
    It is also using unnecessarily small TCP/IP packet sizes.
  - doveadm who and kick did not flush protocol output correctly.
  - imap: SETMETADATA with literal value would delete the metadata value
    instead of updating it.
  - imap: When client issues FETCH PREVIEW (LAZY=FUZZY) command, the
    caching decisions should be updated so that newly saved mails will
    have the preview cached.
  - With mail_nfs_index=yes and/or mail_nfs_storage=yes setuid/setgid
    permission bits in some files may have become dropped with some NFS
    servers. Changed NFS flushing to now use chmod() instead of chown().
  - quota: warnings did not work if quota root was noenforcing
  - acl: Global ACL file ignored the last line if it didn't end with LF.
  - doveadm stats dump: With JSON formatter output numbers using the
    number type instead of as strings
  - lmtp_proxy: Ensure that real_* variables are correctly set when using
    lmtp_proxy.
  - event exporter: http-post driver had hardcoded timeout and did not
    support DNS lookups or TLS connections.
  - auth: Fix user iteration to work with userdb passwd with glibc v2.28.
  - auth: auth service can crash if auth-policy JSON response is invalid
    or returned too fast.
  - In some rare situations "ps" output could have shown a lot of "?"
    characters after Dovecot process titles.
  - When dovecot.index.pvt is empty, an unnecessary error is logged:
    Error: .../dovecot.index.pvt reset, view is now inconsistent
  - SMTP address encoder duplicated initial double quote character when
    the localpart of an address ended in '..'. For example
    "user+..@example.com" became ""user+.."@example.com in a
    sieve redirect.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.8
  - Sieve may leak resources in rare cases when a redirect, vacation or
    report action fails to send the message. This mainly applies when
    Sieve is executed in IMAP context; i.e., for the IMAPSIEVE or
    FILTER=SIEVE capabilities.

      https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/lua/
    + Add event exporters that allow exporting raw events to log files and
      external systems, see
      https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/event_export/
    + SNIPPET is now PREVIEW and size has been increased to 200 characters.
    + Add body option to fts_enforced. This triggers building FTS index only
      on body search, and an error using FTS index fails the search rather
      than reads through all the mails.
    - Submission/LMTP: Fixed crash when domain argument is invalid in a
      second EHLO/LHLO command.
    - Copying/moving mails using Maildir format loses IMAP keywords in the
      destination if the mail also has no system flags.
    - mail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save caused email body
      to be unnecessarily opened when FETCHing mail headers that were
      already cached.
    - mail attachment detection keywords not saved with maildir.
    - dovecot.index.cache may have grown excessively large in some
      situations. This happened especially when using autoexpunging with
      lazy_expunge folders. Also with mdbox format in general the cache file
      wasn't recreated as often as it should have.
    - Autoexpunged mails weren't immediately deleted from the disk. Instead,
      the deletion from disk happened the next time the folder was opened.
      This could have caused unnecessary delays if the opening was done by
      an interactive IMAP session.
    - Dovecot's TCP connections sometimes add extra 40ms latency due to not
      enabling TCP_NODELAY. HTTP and SMTP/LMTP connections weren't
      affected, but everything else was. This delay wasn't always visible -
      only in some situations with some message/packet sizes.
    - imapc: Fix various crash conditions
    - Dovecot builds were not always reproducible.
    - login-proxy: With shutdown_clients=no after config reload the
      existing connections could no longer be listed or kicked with doveadm.
    - "doveadm proxy kick" with -f parameter caused a crash in some
      situations.
    - Auth policy can cause segmentation fault crash during auth process
      shutdown if all auth requests have not been finished.
    - Fix various minor bugs leading into incorrect behaviour in mailbox
      list index handling. These rarely caused noticeable problems.
    - LDAP auth: Iteration accesses freed memory, possibly crashing
      auth-worker
    - local_name { .. } filter in dovecot.conf does not correctly support
      multiple names and wildcards were matched incorrectly.
    - replicator: dsync assert-crashes if it can't connect to remote TCP
      server.
    - config: Memory leak in config process when ssl_dh setting wasn't
      set and there was no ssl-parameters.dat file.
      This caused config process to die once in a while
      with "out of memory".

- bsc#1134242 - upgrade from 42.3 to 15.1: dovecot shows Unknown
  protocol 'SSLv2'
  * remove !SSLv2 from existing ssl_protocols configuration
    during upgrade

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 13:49:18 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.6
  + sieve: Redirect loop prevention is sometimes ineffective.
    Improve existing loop detection by also recognizing the
    X-Sieve-Redirected-From header in incoming messages and
    dropping redirect actions when it points to the sending
    account. This header is already added by the redirect action,
    so this improvement only adds an additional use of this header.
  - sieve: Prevent execution of implicit keep upon temporary
    failure occurring at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 13:34:16 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.6: (boo#1133624 boo#1133625)
  * CVE-2019-11494: Submission-login crashed with signal 11 due to
    null pointer access when authentication was aborted by
    disconnecting.
  * CVE-2019-11499: Submission-login crashed when authentication
    was started over TLS secured channel and invalid authentication
    message was sent.
  * auth: Support password grant with passdb oauth2.
  + Use system default CAs for outbound TLS connections.
  + Simplify array handling with new helper macros.
  + fts_solr: Enable configuring batch_size and soft_commit features.
  - lmtp/submission: Fixed various bugs in XCLIENT handling,
    including a hang when XCLIENT commands were sent infinitely to
    the remote server.
  - lmtp/submission: Forwarded multi-line replies were erroneously
    sent as two replies to the client.
  - lib-smtp: client: Message was not guaranteed to contain CRLF
    consistently when CHUNKING was used.
  - fts_solr: Plugin was no longer compatible with Solr 7.
  - Make it possible to disable certificate checking without
    setting ssl_client_ca_* settings.
  - pop3c: SSL support was broken.
  - mysql: Closing connection twice lead to crash on some systems.
  - auth: Multiple oauth2 passdbs crashed auth process on deinit.
  - HTTP client connection errors infrequently triggered a
    segmentation fault when the connection was idle and not used
    for a particular client instance.

  [PATCH] driver-mysql: Avoid double-closing MySQL connection

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 11:40:06 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5.2 (boo#1132501)
  * CVE-2019-10691: Trying to login with 8bit username containing
    invalid UTF8 input causes auth process to crash if auth policy
    is enabled. This could be used rather easily to cause a DoS.
    Similar crash also happens during mail delivery when using
    invalid UTF8 in From or Subject header when OX push
    notification driver is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 12:36:55 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5.1 (boo#1130116)
  * CVE-2019-7524: Missing input buffer size validation leads into
    arbitrary buffer overflow when reading fts or pop3 uidl header
    from Dovecot index. Exploiting this requires direct write
    access to the index files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  8 18:09:00 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5
  + Lua push notification driver: mail keywords and flags are
    provided in MessageNew and MessageAppend events.
  + submission: Implement support for plugins.
  + auth: When auth_policy_log_only=yes, only log what the policy
    server response would do without actually doing it.
  + auth: Always log policy server decisions with auth_verbose=yes
  - v2.3.[34]: doveadm log errors: Output was missing user/session
  - lda: Debug log lines could have shown slightly corrupted
  - login proxy: Login processes may have crashed in various ways
    when login_proxy_max_disconnect_delay was set.
  - imap: Fix crash with Maildir+zlib if client disconnects during
    APPEND
  - lmtp proxy: Fix potential assert-crash
  - lmtp/submission: Fix crash when SMTP client transaction times
    out
  - submission: Split large XCLIENT commands to 512 bytes per
    command, so Postfix accepts them.
  - submission: Fix crash when client sends invalid BURL command
  - submission: relay backend: VRFY command: Avoid forwarding 500
    and 502 replies back to client.
  - lib-http: Fix potential assert-crash when DNS lookup fails
  - lib-fts: Fix search query generation when one language ignores
    a token (e.g. via stopwords).
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.5
  + IMAPSieve: Add new plugin/imapsieve_expunge_discarded setting
    which causes messages discarded by an IMAPSieve script to be
    expunged immediately, rather than only being marked as
    "\Deleted" (which is still the default behavior).
  - IMAPSieve: Fix panic crash occurring when a COPY command copies
    messages from a virtual mailbox where the source messages
    originate from more than a single real mailbox.
  - imap4flags extension: Fix deleting all keywords. When the
    action resulted in all keywords being removed, no changes were
    actually applied.
  - variables extension: Fix truncation of UTF-8 variable content.
    The maximum size of Sieve variables was enforced by truncating
    the variable string content bluntly at the limit, but this does
    not consider UTF-8 code point boundaries. This resulted in
    broken UTF-8 strings. This problem also surfaced for variable
    modifiers, such as the ":encodeurl" modifier provided by the
    Sieve "enotify" extension. In that case, the resulting URI
    escaping could also be truncated inappropriately.
  - IMAPSieve, IMAP FILTER=SIEVE: Fix replacing a modified message.
    Sieve scripts running in IMAPSIEVE or IMAP FILTER=SIEVE context
    that modify the message, stored the message a second time,
    rather than replacing the originally stored unmodified message.
  - Fix segmentation fault occurring when both the
    sieve_extprograms plugin (for the Sieve interpreter) and the
    imap_filter_sieve plugin (for IMAP) are loaded at the same
    time. A symbol was defined by both plugins, causing a clash
    when both were loaded.
- drop patches which were backports
  - 10048229...de42b54a.patch
  - 3c5101ffdd2a8115e03ed7180d53578765dea4c9.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  5 13:45:52 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.4.1 (boo#1123022)
  * CVE-2019-3814: If imap/pop3/managesieve/submission client has
    trusted certificate with missing username field
    (ssl_cert_username_field), under some configurations Dovecot
    mistakenly trusts the username provided via authentication
    instead of failing.
  * ssl_cert_username_field setting was ignored with external
    SMTP AUTH, because none of the MTAs (Postfix, Exim) currently
    send the cert_username field. This may have allowed users with
    trusted certificate to specify any username in the
    authentication. This bug didn't affect Dovecot's Submission
    service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 17 21:57:42 UTC 2019 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- add buildrequires zlib-devel which used to be pulled in by other
  buildrequires, but no longer is

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  6 17:32:43 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 25 00:17:08 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- added 10048229...de42b54a.patch:
  Fix build failures on TW i586

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 24 00:27:59 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.4
  * The default postmaster_address is now "postmaster@<user domain
    or server hostname>". If username contains the @domain part,
    that's used. If not, then the server's hostname is used.
  * "doveadm stats dump" now returns two decimals for the "avg"
    field.
  + Added push notification driver that uses a Lua script
  + Added new SQL, DNS and connection events.
    See https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Events
  + Added "doveadm mailbox cache purge" command.
  + Added events API support for Lua scripts
  + doveadm force-resync -f parameter performs "index fsck" while
    opening the index. This may be useful to fix some types of
    broken index files.  This may become the default behavior in a
    later version.
  - director: Kicking a user crashes if login process is very slow
  - pop3_no_flag_updates=no: Don't expunge DELEted and RETRed
    messages unless QUIT is sent.
  - auth: Fix crypt() segfault with glibc-2.28+
  - imap: Running UID FILTER script with errors assert-crashes
  - dsync, pop3-migration: POP3 UIDLs weren't added to
    dovecot.index.cache while mails were saved.
  - dict clients may have been using 100% CPU while waiting for
    dict server to finish commands.
  - doveadm user: Fixed user listing via HTTP API
  - All levels of Cassandra log messages were logged as Dovecot
    errors.
  - http/smtp client may have crashed after SSL handshake
  - Lua auth converted strings that looked like numbers into
    numbers.
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.4
  * Adjustments to several changes in Dovecot v2.3.4 make this
    Pigeonhole release dependent on that Dovecot release; it will
    not compile against older Dovecot versions. And, conversely,
    you need to upgrade Pigeonhole when upgrading Dovecot to
    v2.3.4.
  * The changes regarding the default postmaster_address in Dovecot
    v2.3.4 mainly apply to Pigeonhole. The new default should work
    for all existing installations, thereby fixing several reported
    v2.3/v0.5 migration problems.
  - IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix assert crash occurring when running
    UID FILTER on a Sieve script with errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 22:55:38 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.3
  - Fix assertion panic occurring when managesieve service fails to
    open INBOX while saving a Sieve script. This was caused by a
    lack of cleanup after failure.
  - Fix specific messages causing an assert panic with actions that
    compose a reply (e.g. vacation). With some rather weird input
    from the original message, the header folding algorithm (as
    used for composing the References header for the reply) got
    confused, causing the panic.
  - IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix FILTER SIEVE SCRIPT command
    parsing.  After finishing reading the Sieve script, the command
    parsing sometimes didn't continue with the search arguments.
    This is a time- critical bug that likely only occurs when the
    Sieve script is sent in the next TCP frame.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 22:54:12 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.3
  * doveconf hides more secrets now in the default output.
  * ssl_dh setting is no longer enforced at startup. If it's not
    set and non-ECC DH key exchange happens, error is logged and
    client is disconnected.
  + Added log_debug=<filter> setting.
  + Added log_core_filter=<log filter> setting.
  + quota-clone: Write to dict asynchronously
  + --enable-hardening attempts to use retpoline Spectre 2
    mitigations
  + lmtp proxy: Support source_ip passdb extra field.
  + doveadm stats dump: Support more fields and output stddev
    by default.
  + push-notification: Add SSL support for OX backend.
  - NUL bytes in mail headers can cause truncated replies when
    fetched.
  - director: Conflicting host up/down state changes may in some
    rare situations ended up in a loop of two directors constantly
    overwriting each others' changes.
  - director: Fix hang/crash when multiple doveadm commands are
    being handled concurrently.
  - director: Fix assert-crash if doveadm disconnects too early
  - virtual plugin: Some searches used 100% CPU for many seconds
  - dsync assert-crashed with acl plugin in some situations.
  - mail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save
    assert-crashed with some specific Sieve scripts.
  - Mail snippet generation crashed with mails containing invalid
    Content-Type:multipart header.
  - Log prefix ordering was different for some log lines.
  - quota: With noenforcing option current quota usage wasn't
    updated.
  - auth: Kerberos authentication against Samba assert-crashed.
  - stats clients were unnecessarily chatty with the stats server.
  - imapc: Fixed various assert-crashes when reconnecting to
    server.
  - lmtp, submission: Fix potential crash if client disconnects
    while handling a command.
  - quota: Fixed compiling with glibc-2.26 / support libtirpc.
  - fts-solr: Empty search values resulted in 400 Bad Request
    errors
  - fts-solr: default_ns parameter couldn't be used
  - submission server crashed if relay server returned over 7 lines
    in a reply (e.g. to EHLO)

Wed Jul 11 14:17:57 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.3.2.1
  - SSL/TLS servers may have crashed during client disconnection
  - lmtp: With lmtp_rcpt_check_quota=yes mail deliveries may have
    sometimes assert-crashed.
  - v2.3.2: "make check" may have crashed with 32bit systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 30 20:06:40 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.3.2
  * old-stats plugin: Don't temporarily enable PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    while opening /proc/self/io. This may still cause security
    problems if the process is ptrace()d at the same time.
    Instead, open it while still running as root.
  + doveadm: Added mailbox cache decision&remove commands. See
    doveadm-mailbox(1) man page for details.
  + doveadm: Added rebuild attachments command for rebuilding
    $HasAttachment or $HasNoAttachment flags for matching mails.
    See doveadm-rebuild(1) man page for details.
  + cassandra: Use fallback_consistency on more types of errors
  + lmtp proxy: Support outgoing SSL/TLS connections
  + lmtp: Add lmtp_rawlog_dir and lmtp_proxy_rawlog_dir settings.
  + submission: Add support for rawlog_dir
  + submission: Add submission_client_workarounds setting.
  + lua auth: Add password_verify() function and additional fields
    in auth request.
  - doveadm-server: TCP connections are hanging when there is a lot
    of network output. This especially caused hangs in
    dsync-replication.
  - Using multiple type=shared mdbox namespaces crashed
  - mail_fsync setting was ignored. It was always set to
    "optimized".
  - lua auth: Fix potential crash at deinit
  - SSL/TLS servers may have crashed if client disconnected during
    handshake.
  - SSL/TLS servers: Don't send extraneous certificates to client
    when alt certs are used.
  - lda, lmtp: Return-Path header without '<' may have
    assert-crashed.
  - lda, lmtp: Unencoded UTF-8 in email address headers may
    assert-crash
  - lda: -f parameter didn't allow empty/null/domainless address
  - lmtp, submission: Message size limit was hardcoded to 40 MB.
    Exceeding it caused the connection to get dropped during
    transfer.
  - lmtp: Fix potential crash when delivery fails at DATA stage
  - lmtp: login_greeting setting was ignored
  - Fix to work with OpenSSL v1.0.2f
  - systemd unit restrictions were too strict by default
  - Fix potential crashes when a lot of log output was produced
  - SMTP client may have assert-crashed when sending mail
  - IMAP COMPRESS: Send "end of compression" marker when
    disconnecting.
  - cassandra: Fix consistency=quorum to work
  - dsync: Lock file generation failed if home directory didn't
    exist
  - Snippet generation for HTML mails didn't ignore &entities
    inside blockquotes, producing strange looking snippets.
  - imapc: Fix assert-crash if getting disconnected and after
    reconnection all mails in the selected mailbox are gone.
  - pop3c: Handle unexpected server disconnections without
    assert-crash
  - fts: Fixes to indexing mails via virtual mailboxes.
  - fts: If mails contained NUL characters, the text around it
    wasn't indexed.
  - Obsolete dovecot.index.cache offsets were sometimes used.
    Trying to fetch a field that was just added to cache file may
    not have always found it.
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.2
  + Implement plugin for the a vendor-defined IMAP capability
    called "FILTER=SIEVE". It adds the ability to manually invoke
    Sieve filtering in IMAP. More information can be found in
    doc/plugins/imap_filter_sieve.txt.
  - The Sieve addess test caused an assertion panic for invalid
    addresses with UTF-8 codepoints in the localpart. Fixed by
    properly detecting invalid addresses with UTF-8 codepoints in
    the localpart and skipping these like other invalid addresses
    while iterating addresses for the address test.
  - Make the length of the subject header for the vacation response
    configurable and enforce the limit in UTF-8 codepoints rather
    than bytes. The subject header for a vacation response was
    statically truncated to 256 bytes, which is too limited for
    multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
  - Sieve editheader extension: Fix assertion panic occurring when
    it is used to manipulate a message header with a very large
    header field.
  - Properly abort execution of the sieve_discard script upon
    error.  Before, the LDA Sieve plugin attempted to execute the
    sieve_discard script when an error occurs. This can lead to the
    message being lost.
  - Fix the interaction between quota and the sieve_discard script.
    When quota was used together with a sieve_discard script, the
    message delivery did not bounce when the quota was exceeded.
- refreshed to apply cleanly again dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch

Wed Mar 28 09:02:33 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.1
  - Explicitly disallow UTF-8 in localpart in addresses parsed from
    Sieve script.
  - editheader extension: Corrected the stream position
    calculations performed while making the modified message
    available as a stream.  Pigeonhole Sieve crashed in LMTP with
    an assertion panic when the Sieve editheader extension was used
    before the message was redirected.  Experiments indicate that
    the problem occurred only with LMTP and that LDA is not
    affected.
  - fileinto extension: Fix assert panic occurring when fileinto is
    used without being listed in the require line, while the copy
    extension is listed there. This is a very old bug.
  - imapsieve plugin: Do not assert crash or log an error for
    messages that disappear concurrently while applying Sieve
    scripts. This event is now logged as a debug message.
  - Sieve extprograms plugin: Large output from "execute" command
    crashed delivery. Fixed buffering issue in code that handles
    output from the external program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 18:28:48 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.3.1
  * Submission server support improvements and bug fixes
    - Lots of bug fixes to submission server
  * API CHANGE: array_idx_modifiable will no longer allocate space
    - Particularly affects how you should check MODULE_CONTEXT
      result, or use REQUIRE_MODULE_CONTEXT.
  + mail_attachment_detection_options setting controls when

  + imap: Support fetching body snippets using FETCH (SNIPPET) or
    (SNIPPET (LAZY=FUZZY))

    auth_cache_verify_password_with_worker=yes.
  + Added charset_alias plugin. See
    https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins/CharsetAlias
  + imap_logout_format and pop3_logout_format settings now support
    all of the generic variables (e.g. %{rip}, %{session}, etc.)
  + Added auth_policy_check_before_auth,
    auth_policy_check_after_auth and auth_policy_report_after_auth
    settings.

  * CVE-2017-15130: TLS SNI config lookups may lead to excessive
    memory usage, causing imap-login/pop3-login VSZ limit to be
    reached and the process restarted. This happens only if Dovecot
    config has local_name { } or local { } configuration blocks and
    attacker uses randomly generated SNI servernames. (boo#1082828)
  * CVE-2017-14461: Parsing invalid email addresses may cause a
    crash or leak memory contents to attacker. For example, these
    memory contents might contain parts of an email from another
    user if the same imap process is reused for multiple users.
    First discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
    Independently also discovered by "flxflndy" via HackerOne.
    (boo#1082826)
  * CVE-2017-15132: Aborted SASL authentication leaks memory in
    login process. (boo#1075608)
  * Linux: Core dumping is no longer enabled by default via
    PR_SET_DUMPABLE, because this may allow attackers to bypass
    chroot/group restrictions. Found by cPanel Security Team.
    Nowadays core dumps can be safely enabled by using "sysctl -w
    fs.suid_dumpable=2". If the old behaviour is wanted, it can
    still be enabled by setting:
    import_environment=$import_environment PR_SET_DUMPABLE=1
  - imap-login with SSL/TLS connections may end up in infinite loop

- Move the example-config + mkcert.sh to /usr/share/dovecot
  This makes the files no longer documentation and they actually

- starting 2.3 package based on the latest 2.2 branch

  There are several new and exciting features in v2.3.0. I'm
  especially happy about the new logging and statistics code, which
  will allow us to generate statistics for just about everything.
  We didn't have time to implement everything we wanted for them
  yet, and there especially aren't all that many logging events yet
  that can be used for statistics. We'll implement those to v2.3.1,
  which might also mean that some of the APIs might still change in
  v2.3.1 if that's required.

  We also have new lib-smtp server code, which was used to
  implement SMTP submission server and do a partial rewrite for
  LMTP server.

  Some of the larger changes:

   * Various setting changes, see

     https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Upgrading/2.3

     If you upgrade from 2.2: Config file changes:
     - Removed:
       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/11-object-storage.conf
     - Added:
       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-submission.conf

   * Logging rewrite started: Logging is now based on hierarchical
     events.  This makes it possible to do various things, like: 1)
     giving consistent log prefixes, 2) enabling debug logging with
     finer granularity, 3) provide logs in more machine readable
     formats (e.g. json). Everything isn't finished yet, especially
     a lot of the old logging code still needs to be translated to
     the new way.
   * Statistics rewrite started: Stats are now based on (log)
     events.  It's possible to gather statistics about any event
     that is logged.  See http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Statistics for
     details
   * ssl_dh setting replaces the old generated ssl-parameters.dat
   * IMAP: When BINARY FETCH finds a broken mails, send [PARSE]
     error instead of [UNKNOWNCTE]
   * Linux: core dumping via PR_SET_DUMPABLE is no longer enabled
     by default due to potential security reasons (found by cPanel
     Security Team).

   + Added support for SMTP submission proxy server, which
     includes support for BURL and CHUNKING extension.
   + LMTP rewrite. Supports now CHUNKING extension and mixing of
     local/proxy recipients.
   + auth: Support libsodium to add support for ARGON2I and
     ARGON2ID password schemes.
   + auth: Support BLF-CRYPT password scheme in all platforms
   + auth: Added LUA scripting support for passdb/userdb.
     See https://wiki2.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/Lua
   - Input streams are more reliable now when there are errors or
     when the maximum buffer size is reached. Previously in some
     situations this could have caused Dovecot to try to read
     already freed memory.
   - Output streams weren't previously handling failures when
     writing a trailer at the end of the stream. This mainly
     affected encrypt and zlib compress ostreams, which  have
     silently written truncated files if the last write happened to
     fail (which shouldn't normally have ever happened).
   - virtual plugin: Fixed panic when fetching mails from virtual
     mailboxes with IMAP BINARY extension.
   - doveadm-server: Fix potential hangs with SSL connections
   - doveadm proxy: Reading commands' output from v2.2.33+ servers
     could have caused the output to be corrupted or caused a
     crash.
   - Many other smaller fixes
- patches:
  - dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch
  - dovecot-2.3.0-dont_use_etc_ssl_certs.patch
