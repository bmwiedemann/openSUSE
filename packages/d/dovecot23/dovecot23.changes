Tue May 10 17:55:17 UTC 2022 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- update to 2.3.19 and pigeonhole 0.5.19

  Dovecot 2.3.19
  + Added mail_user_session_finished event, which is emitted when the mail
    user session is finished (e.g. imap, pop3, lmtp). It also includes
    fields with some process statistics information.
    See https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/ for more
    information.
  + Added process_shutdown_filter setting. When an event matches the filter,
    the process will be shutdown after the current connection(s) have
    finished. This is intended to reduce memory usage of long-running imap
    processes that keep a lot of memory allocated instead of freeing it to
    the OS.
  + auth: Add cache hit indicator to auth passdb/userdb finished events.
    See https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/ for more
    information.
  + doveadm deduplicate: Performance is improved significantly.
  + imapc: COPY commands were sent one mail at a time to the remote IMAP
    server. Now the copying is buffered, so multiple mails can be copied
    with a single COPY command.
  + lib-lua: Add a Lua interface to Dovecot's HTTP client library. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/lua/ for more information.
  - auth: Cache lookup would use incorrect cache key after username change.
  - auth: Improve handling unexpected LDAP connection errors/hangs.
    Try to fix up these cases by reconnecting to the LDAP server and
    aborting LDAP requests earlier.
  - auth: Process crashed if userdb iteration was attempted while auth-workers
    were already full handling auth requests.
  - auth: db-oauth2: Using %{oauth2:name} variables caused unnecessary
    introspection requests.
  - dict: Timeouts may have been leaked at deinit.
  - director: Ring may have become unstable if a backend's tag was changed.
    It could also have caused director process to crash.
  - doveadm kick: Numeric parameter was treated as IP address.
  - doveadm: Proxying can panic when flushing print output. Fixes
    Panic: file ioloop.c: line 865 (io_loop_destroy): assertion failed:
    (ioloop == current_ioloop).
  - doveadm sync: BROKENCHAR was wrongly changed to '_' character when
    migrating mailboxes. This was set by default to %, so any mailbox
    names containing % characters were modified to "_25".
  - imapc: Copying or moving mails with doveadm to an imapc mailbox could
    have produced "Error: Syncing mailbox '[...]' failed" Errors. The
    operation itself succeeded but attempting to sync the destination
    mailbox failed.
  - imapc: Prevent index log synchronization errors when two or more imapc
    sessions are adding messages to the same mailbox index files, i.e.
    INDEX=MEMORY is not used.
  - indexer: Process was slowly leaking memory for each indexing request.
  - lib-fts: fts header filters caused binary content to be sent to the
    indexer with non-default configuration.
  - doveadm-server: Process could hang in some situations when printing
    output to TCP client, e.g. when printing doveadm sync state.
  - lib-index: dovecot.index.log files were often read and parsed entirely,
    rather than only the parts that were actually necessary. This mainly
    increased CPU usage.
  - lmtp-proxy: Session ID forwarding would cause same session IDs being
    used when delivering same mail to multiple backends.
  - log: Log prefix update may have been lost if log process was busy.
    This could have caused log prefixes to be empty or in some cases
    reused between sessions, i.e. log lines could have been logged for the
    wrong user/session.
  - mail_crypt: Plugin crashes if it's loaded only for some users. Fixes
    Panic: Module context mail_crypt_user_module missing.
  - mail_crypt: When LMTP was delivering mails to both recipients with mail
    encryption enabled and not enabled, the non-encrypted recipients may
    have gotten mails encrypted anyway. This happened when the first
    recipient was encrypted (mail_crypt_save_version=2) and the 2nd
    recipient was not encrypted (mail_crypt_save_version=0).
  - pop3: Session would crash if empty line was sent.
  - stats: HTTP server leaked memory.
  - submission-login: Long credentials, such as OAUTH2 tokens, were refused
    during SASL interactive due to submission server applying line length
    limits.
  - submission-login: When proxying to remote host, authentication was not
    using interactive SASL when logging in using long credentials such as
    OAUTH2 tokens. This caused authentication to fail due to line length
    constraints in SMTP protocol.
  - submission: Terminating the client connection with QUIT command after
    mail transaction is started with MAIL command and before it is
    finished with DATA/BDAT can cause a segfault crash.
  - virtual: doveadm search queries with mailbox-guid as the only parameter
    crashes: Panic: file virtual-search.c: line 77 (virtual_search_get_records):
    assertion failed: (result != 0)

  Pigeonhole v0.5.19
  * This release is done to maintain parity with dovecot 2.3.19 release,
    so it does not contain any news-worthy changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  3 20:51:46 UTC 2022 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.18 and pigeonhole to 0.5.18
  * removed obsolete mail-cache-bigendian.diff

  Dovecot 2.3.18
  * Removed mail_cache_lookup_finished event. This event wasn't especially
    useful, but it increased CPU usage significantly.
  * fts: Don't index inline base64 encoded content in FTS indexes using
    the generic tokenizer. This reduces the FTS index sizes by removing
    input that is very unlikely to be searched for. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/fts/tokenization for
    details on how base64 is detected. Only applies when using libfts.
  * lmtp: Session IDs are now preserved through proxied connections, so
    LMTP sessions can be tracked. This slightly changes the LMTP session
    ID format by appending ":Tn" (transaction), ":Pn" (proxy connection)
    and ":Rn" (recipient) counters after the session ID prefix.
  + Events now have "reason_code" field, which can provide a list of
    reasons why the event is happening. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/event_reasons/
  + New events are added. See https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/
  + fts: Added fts_header_excludes and fts_header_includes settings to
    specify which headers to index. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/fts-plugin#plugin-fts-setting-fts-header-excludes
    for configuration details.
  + fts: Initialize the textcat language detection library only once per
    process. This can reduce CPU usage if fts_languages setting has multiple
    languages listed and service indexer-worker { service_count } isn't 1.
    Only applies when using libfts.
  + lib-storage: Reduced CPU usage significantly for some operations that
    accessed lots of emails (e.g. fetching all flags in a folder, SORT, ...)
  + lib: DOVECOT_PREREQ() - Add micro version which enables compiling
    external plugins against different versions of Dovecot.
  + lmtp: Added new lmtp_verbose_replies setting that makes errors sent to
    the LMTP client much more verbose with details about why exactly
    backend proxy connections or commands are failing.
  + submission: Support implicit SASL EXTERNAL with
    submission_client_workarounds=implicit-auth-external. This allows
    automatically logging in when SSL client certificate is present.
  - *-login: Statistics were disabled if stats process connection was lost.
  - auth: Authentication master user login fails with SCRAM-* SASL mechanisms.
  - auth: With auth_cache_verify_password_with_worker=yes, passdb extra
    fields in the auth cache got lost.
  - doveadm: Fixed crash if zlib_save_level setting was specified,
    but zlib_save was unset. v2.3.15 regression.
  - doveadm: Proxying can panic when flushing print output. v2.3.17
    regression. Fixes:
    Panic: file ioloop.c: line 865 (io_loop_destroy): assertion failed:
    (ioloop == current_ioloop)
  - doveadm: stats add --group-by parameter didn't work.
  - fts: Using email-address fts tokenizer could result in excessive memory
    usage with garbage email input. This could cause the indexer-worker
    processes to fail due to reaching the VSZ memory size limit.
    Only applies when using libfts.
  - imap: A SEARCH command timing out while fts returns indexes may timeout
    returning "NO [SERVERBUG]", while it should return "NO [INUSE]" instead.
  - imap: LIST-EXTENDED doesn't return STATUS for all folders. Sending
    LIST .. RETURN (SUBSCRIBED STATUS (...)) did not return STATUS for
    folders that are not subscribed when they have a child folder that is
    subscribed as mandated by IMAP RFCs.
  - imapc: Mailbox vsize calculation crashed with
    Panic: file index-mailbox-size.c: line 344 (index_mailbox_vsize_hdr_add_missing):
    assertion failed: (mails_left > 0)
  - indexer: If indexer-worker crashes, the request it was processing gets
    stuck in the indexer process. This stops indexing for the folder until
    indexer process is restarted. v2.3.14 regression.
  - indexer: Process was slowly leaking memory for each indexing request.
  - lib-event: Unnamed events were wrongly filtered out for event/metric
    filters like "event=abc OR something_independent_of_event_name".
  - lib-index: 64-bit big endian CPUs handle last_used field in
    dovecot.index.cache wrong.
  - lib-ssl-iostream: Fix buggy OpenSSL error handling without assert-crashing.
    If there is no error available, log it as an error instead of crashing.
    The previous fix for this in v2.3.11 was incomplete. Fixes
    Panic: file istream-openssl.c: line 51 (i_stream_ssl_read_real):
    assertion failed: (errno != 0)
  - lmtp: Out-of-memory issues can happen when proxying large messages to
    LMTP backend servers that accept the message data too slow.
  - master: HAProxy header parsing has read buffer overflow if provided
    header size is invalid. This happens only if inet_listener
    { haproxy=yes } is configured and only if the remote IP address is in
    haproxy_trusted_networks.
  - old_stats: Plugin kept increasing memory usage, which became
    noticeable with long-running imap sessions.
  - stats: Dynamically adding same metric multiple times causes multiple stats.
  - submission-login: Authentication does not accept OAUTH2 token (or
    other very long credentials) because it considers the line to be too long.
  - submission-login: Process can crash if HELO is pipelined with an
    invalid domain.
  - submission-proxy: Don't use SASL-IR if it would make the AUTH command
    line longer than 512 bytes.
  - submission: Service would crash if relay server authentication failed.
  - virtual: FTS search in a virtual folder could crash if there are
    duplicate mailbox GUIDs. This mainly happened when user had both INBOX
    and INBOX/INBOX folders and the namespace prefix was INBOX/. Fixes
    Panic: file hash.c: line 252 (hash_table_insert_node):
    assertion failed: (opcode == HASH_TABLE_OP_UPDATE)
  - virtual: If mailbox opening fails, the backend mailbox is leaked and
    process crashes when client disconnects. Fixes
    Panic: file mail-user.c: line 232 (mail_user_deinit):
    assertion failed: ((*user)->refcount == 1)
  - virtual: Searching headers in virtual folders didn't always use
    full-text search indexes, if fts_enforced=no or body.

  Pigeonhole v0.5.18
  - duplicate: Users without a home directory can crash with Sieve when
    using duplicate database. v2.3.17 regression.
  - imapsieve: When mail was expunged when processing imapsieve events, a
    crash could occur. Fixes Panic: file mail-index-map.c:
    line 558 (mail_index_map_lookup_seq_range): assertion failed: (first_uid > 0)
  - managesieve-login: Proxy didn't support forwarding the forward_* passdb fields.
  - redirect: Sieve would crash if redirect after keep-equivalent action failed.
  - sieve: Interpreter crashes when the Sieve index extension is used with
    index zero.
  - vnd.dovecot.filter: Envelope sender string may become corrupted when
    Sieve scripts are using vnd.dovecot.filter. This could end up
    corrupting mbox's From line and return wrong envelope sender string in

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  2 12:28:24 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix dovecot-2.3.0-dont_use_etc_ssl_certs.patch: Align the
  certificate path/filenames to /etc/ssl/private/*.crt, which
  happens to match what the patch also does for mkcert.sh
  (boo#1193909).
- Rebase dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 16 08:14:51 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Update dovecot-2.3.0-dont_use_etc_ssl_certs.patch to also adjust
  the path in the 10-ssl.conf example (boo#1193758)
- Rebase dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 18:54:54 UTC 2021 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.17.1 and pigeonhole to 0.5.17.1
- rebased dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch

  Dovecot 2.3.17.1
  - dsync: Add back accidentically removed parameters.
  - lib-ssl-iostream: Fix assert-crash when OpenSSL returned syscall error
    without errno.
  - master: Dovecot failed to start if ssl_ca was too large.
  Dovecot 2.3.17
  * Dovecot now logs a warning if time seems to jump forward at least
    100 milliseconds.
  * dict: Lines logged by the dict process now contain the dict name as
    the prefix.
  * lib-index: mail_cache_fields, mail_always_cache_fields and
    mail_never_cache_fields now verifies that the listed header names are
    valid. Especially the UTF8 "‚Äì" character has sometimes been wrongly
    used instead of the ASCII "-".
  + *-login: Added login_proxy_rawlog_dir setting to capture
    rawlogs between proxy and backend.
  + dict: The server process now keeps the last 10 idle dict backends
    cached for maximum of 30 seconds. Practically this acts as a
    connection pool for dict-redis and dict-ldap. Note that this doesn't
    affect dict-sql, because it already had its own internal cache.
  + doveadm: New stats add/remove commands added to support changing the
    metrics configuration on runtime.
  + lazy_expunge: Added lazy_expunge_exclude settings to disable
    lazy_expunge for specific folders. \Special-use flags can be used as
    folder names.
  + lib-lua: Added a new helper function dovecot.restrict_global_variables()
    to disable or enable defining new global variables.
  - LAYOUT=index List index rebuild was missing.
  - LAYOUT=index: Duplicate GUIDs were not detected.
  - acl: When using acl_ignore_namespace Dovecot attempted to access or
    create dovecot-acl-list even when the namespace should have been
    ignored. For virtual namespaces this could have yielded errors about
    "Read-only file system" or "Permission denied".
  - auth: Setting the "master" passdb field to empty value would
    cause proxying to fail with an authentication error.
    Now an empty "master" field is ignored.
  - doveadm-server: Duplicate error lines were sent for failed commands.
    This didn't normally cause visible problems, except when using
    wildcards in usernames or -A parameter to go through multiple users.
  - doveadm-server: Logs written by doveadm-server were often missing log
    prefixes, especially mail_log_prefix for mail commands. Logs sent to
    doveadm TCP client were also missing log prefixes.
  - doveadm: v2.3 regression: batch command always crashes.
  - doveadm: v2.3.11 regression: Commands failed if ssl_cert or
    ssl_key files weren't readable by the user running doveadm, even
    though doveadm didn't actually use these settings
  - imap-hibernate: Process may crash at deinit:
    Panic: file ioloop.c: line 928 (io_loop_destroy): assertion failed:
    (ioloop->cur_ctx == NULL).
  - imap: Using imap_fetch_failure=no-after can cause assert-crash
    with some IMAP commands if reading the mail fails (e.g. wrong cached
    mail size). Fixes:
    Panic: file index-mail-headers.c: line 198 (index_mail_parse_header_init):
    assertion failed: (!mail->data.header_parser_initialized)
  - imap: v2.3.10 regression: When using INDEXPVT to enable private
    \Seen flags (for shared or public namespaces) the STORE command did
    not send untagged replies for the \Seen flag changes.
  - imap: v2.3.15 regression: If PREVIEW/SNIPPET is not the final FETCH
    option in the command, the IMAP FETCH response is broken.
  - imap: v2.3.15 regression: MOVE command leaks mailbox if it can't be
    opened and crashes at deinit:
    Panic: file mail-user.c: line 229 (mail_user_deinit): assertion failed:
    ((*user)->refcount == 1).
  - imapc: Copying nonexistent mail via imapc could have crashed. Fixes:
    Panic: file mail-storage.c: line 2385 (mailbox_transaction_commit_get_changes):
    assertion failed: (ret < 0 || seq_range_count(&changes_r->saved_uids) == save_count ||
    array_count(&changes_r->saved_uids) == 0).
  - indexer: v2.3.15 regression: Process crashes if indexer-client
    disconnects while it's waiting for command reply. This happened for
    example if IMAP SEARCH triggered long fts indexing and the IMAP
    client disconnected while waiting for the reply.
  - indexer: v2.3.15 regression: Process may have crashed in some situations.
  - indexer: v2.3.15 regression: indexer-worker processes may not have
    reached the process_limit in some situations, possibly even using just
    one indexer-worker process even though there were many indexing
    requests queued.
  - lib-compression: Reading lz4 compressed mdbox mails may crash. Fixes:
    Panic: file istream.c: line 345 (i_stream_read_memarea):
    assertion failed: (!stream->blocking).
  - lib-compression: bench-compress crashes due to xz being read-only.
  - lib-lua: Fix linking libdict_lua for non-GNU linkers when Lua support
    is disabled.
  - lib-mail: There was no limit on how large an email header name could be.
    Processable header names are now limited to 1000 bytes.
  - lib-oauth2: Dovecot disallowed JWT tokens if their validity time was
    older than token creation time (nbf < iat).
  - lib-storage: Reduce memory footprint of certain storage operations.
  - lib-storage: When listing mailboxes with storage name escape
    characters (^ or .) as part of the mailbox name, the listing could
    show corrupted mailbox names. Due to an issue in handling escaped
    parent folders, the listing of other mailbox names would become
    corrupted by prepending parts of the previously listed mailboxes
    parent folder as prefix to the actual mailbox names. The corruption
    can occur when using LAYOUT=INDEX and maildir or obox, or when using
    the listescape plugin.
  - mail-crypt: Fix "-O" argument for "doveadm mailbox cryptokey password"
    command to be a boolean, and not expect a string.
  - submission-login: Add support for not authenticating to next hop in
    submission proxying.
  - submission-login: EHLO was not sent again after XCLIENT when doing
    submission proxying.
  - virtual: Mailboxes do not correctly detect underlying mailboxes
    getting re-created even though they have a different UIDVALIDITY or
    GUID.
  Pigeonhole v0.5.17
  - duplicate: The Sieve duplicate test is prone to false negatives when
    the user receives many e-mails concurrently, meaning that duplicate
    deliveries can still occur.
  - fileinto: v2.3.16 regression: Sieve delivery crashes if mail is
    delivered to non-existing and existing folder.
  - imap-filter-sieve: v2.3.15 regression: The CPU limits on Sieve
    execution are too easily exceeded in IMAP context (the IMAPSieve and
    FILTER=SIEVE capabilities). Changed the default to unlimited CPU time
    for IMAP context, since similar excessive resource usage can be caused
    by other means as well. The CPU limits on Sieve scripts executed at
    LDA/LMTP delivery are still enforced by default.
  - redirect:  The Sieve redirect action has protections against users
    triggering mail loops. Unfortunately, the detection of a redirect mail
    loop sometimes causes the message to get lost if no other Sieve action
    is applied that delivers the message somewhere else.
  - redirect: v2.3.16 regression: With certain Sieve scripts if redirect
    fails due to temporary failure, the lmtp process may crash after the
    delivery. Fixes:
    Panic: file mail-user.c: line 229 (mail_user_deinit):
    assertion failed: ((*user)->refcount == 1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 10 22:38:15 UTC 2021 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- added back-port fix mail-cache-bigendian.diff
- update to 2.3.16 and pigeonhole to 0.5.16:

  Dovecot 2.3.16
  * Any unexpected exit() will now result in a core dump. This can
    especially help notice problems when a Lua script causes exit(0).
  * auth-worker process is now restarted when the number of auth
    requests reaches service auth-worker { service_count }. The default
    is still unlimited.
  + Event improvements: Added data_stack_grow event and http-client
    category. See https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/
  + oauth2: Support RFC 7628 openid-configuration element. This allows
    clients to support OAUTH2 for any server, not just a few hardcoded
    servers like they do now. See openid_configuration_url setting in
    dovecot-oauth2.conf.ext.
  + mysql: Single statements are no longer enclosed with BEGIN/COMMIT.
  + dovecot-sysreport --core supports multiple core files now and does
    not require specifying the binary path.
  + imapc: When imap_acl plugin is loaded and imapc_features=acl is used,
    IMAP ACL commands are proxied to the remote server. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/mail_location/imapc/
  + dict-sql now supports the "UPSERT" syntax for SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  + imap: If IMAP client disconnects during a COPY command, the copying
    is aborted, and changes are reverted. This may help to avoid many
    email duplicates if client disconnects during COPY and retries it
    after reconnecting.
  - master process was using 100% CPU if service attempted to create more
    processes due to process_min_avail, but process_limit was already
    reached. v2.3.15 regression.
  - Using attachment detection flags wrongly logged unnecessary "Failed
    to add attachment keywords" errors. v2.3.13 regression.
  - IMAP QRESYNC: Expunging UID 1 mail resulted in broken VANISHED
    response, which could have confused IMAP clients. v2.3.13 regression.
  - imap: STORE didn't send untagged replies for \Seen changes for
    (shared) mailboxes using INDEXPVT. v2.3.10 regression.
  - rawlog_dir setting would not log input that was pipelined after
    authentication command.
  - Fixed potential infinite looping with autoexpunging.
  - Log event exporter: Truncate long fields to 1000 bytes
  - LAYOUT=index: ACL inheritance didn't work when creating mailboxes
  - Event filters: Unquoted '?' wildcard caused a crash at startup
  - fs-metawrap: Fix to handling zero sized files
  - imap-hibernate: Fixed potential crash at deinit.
  - acl: dovecot-acl-list files were written for acl_ignore_namespaces
  - program-client (used by Sieve extprograms, director_flush_socket)
    may have missed status response from UNIX and network sockets,
    resulting in unexpected failures.

  Pigeonhole v0.5.16
  * .dovecot.sieve.log file now includes year in the header.
  * Change Sieve script result execution to delay definitive action
    execution to the end of a successful Sieve script execution session.
    This is part of an effort to solve problems with the Sieve duplicate
    test. As a side-effect, some rare temporary-error cases yield
    different results, in which partial failure is more likely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 22 15:13:47 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- use lua 5.1 for sle12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 21 11:27:29 UTC 2021 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.15 and pigeonhole to 0.5.15:
  * security fixes for CVE-2021-29157, CVE-2021-33515, and CVE-2020-28200
  * rebased patch dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch
  * removed obsolete back-port patches
    allow-tls1.3-only.patch and openssl-cnf-default_bits-2048.patch
  * require lua53-devel for build

  Dovecot 2.3.15
  * CVE-2021-29157: Dovecot does not correctly escape kid and azp fields in
    JWT tokens. This may be used to supply attacker controlled keys to
    validate tokens, if attacker has local access.
  * CVE-2021-33515: On-path attacker could have injected plaintext commands
    before STARTTLS negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS
    finished with the client.
  * Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
    They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix.
  * Dovecot now depends on libsystemd for systemd integration.
  * Removed support for Lua 5.2. Use version 5.1 or 5.3 instead.
  * config: Some settings are now marked as "hidden". It's discouraged to
    change these settings. They will no longer be visible in doveconf
    output, except if they have been changed or if doveconf -s parameter
    is used. See https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/advanced/ for details.
  * imap-compress: Compression level is now algorithm specific.
    See https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/plugin/compress-plugin/
  * indexer-worker: Convert "Indexed" info logs to an event named
    "indexer_worker_indexing_finished". See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#indexer-worker-indexing-finished
  + Add TSLv1.3 support to min_protocols.
  + Allow configuring ssl_cipher_suites. (for TLSv1.3+)
  + acl: Add acl_ignore_namespace setting which allows to entirely ignore
    ACLs for the listed namespaces.
  + imap: Support official RFC8970 preview/snippet syntax. Old methods of
    retrieving preview information via IMAP commands ("SNIPPET and PREVIEW
    with explicit algorithm selection") have been deprecated.
  + imapc: Support INDEXPVT for imapc storage to enable private
    message flags for cluster wide shared mailboxes.
  + lib-storage: Add new events: mail_opened, mail_expunge_requested,
    mail_expunged, mail_cache_lookup_finished. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail
  + zlib, imap-compression, fs-compress: Support compression levels that
    the algorithm supports. Before, we would allow hardcoded value between
    1 to 9 and would default to 6. Now we allow using per-algorithm value
    range and default to whatever default the algorithm specifies.
  - *-login: Commands pipelined together with and just after the authenticate
    command cause these commands to be executed twice. This applies to all
    protocols that involve user login, which currently comprises of imap,
    pop3, submisision and managesieve.
  - *-login: Processes are supposed to disconnect the oldest non-logged in
    connection when process_limit was reached. This didn't actually happen
    with the default "high-security mode" (with service_count=1) where each
    connection is handled by a separate process.
  - *-login: When login process reaches client/process limits, oldest
    client connections are disconnected. If one of these was still doing
    anvil lookup, this caused a crash. This could happen only if the login
    process limits were very low or if the server was overloaded.
  - Fixed building with link time optimizations (-flto).
  - auth: Userdb iteration with passwd driver does not always return all
    users with some nss drivers.
  - dsync: Shared INBOX not synced when "mail_shared_explicit_inbox" was
    disabled. If a user has a shared mailbox which is another user's INBOX,
    dsync didn't include the mailbox in syncing unless explicit naming is
    enabled with "mail_shared_explicit_inbox" set to "yes".
  - dsync: Shared namespaces were not synced with "-n" flag.
  - dsync: Syncing shared INBOX failed if mail_attribute_dict was not set.
    If a user has a shared mailbox that is another user's INBOX, dsync
    failed to export the mailbox if mail attributes are disabled.
  - fts-solr, fts-tika: Using both Solr FTS and Tika may have caused HTTP
    requests to assert-crash: Panic: file http-client-request.c: line 1232
    (http_client_request_send_more): assertion failed: (req->payload_input != NULL)
  - fts-tika: 5xx errors returned by Tika server as indexing failures.
    However, Tika can return 5xx for some attachments every time.
    So the 5xx error should be retried once, but treated as success if it
    happens on the retry as well. v2.3 regression.
  - fts-tika: v2.3.11 regression: Indexing messages with fts-tika may have
    resulted in Panic: file message-parser.c: line 802 (message_parser_deinit_from_parts):
    assertion failed: (ctx->nested_parts_count == 0 || i_stream_have_bytes_left(ctx->input))
  - imap: SETMETADATA could not be used to unset metadata values.
    Instead NIL was handled as a "NIL" string. v2.3.14 regression.
  - imap: IMAP BINARY FETCH crashes at least on empty base64 body:
    Panic: file index-mail-binary.c: line 358 (blocks_count_lines):
    assertion failed: (block_count == 0 || block_idx+1 == block_count)
  - imap: If IMAP client using the NOTIFY command was disconnected while
    sending FETCH notifications to the client, imap could crash with
    Panic: Trying to close mailbox INBOX with open transactions.
  - imap: Using IMAP COMPRESS extension can cause IMAP connection to hang
    when IMAP commands are >8 kB long.
  - imapc: If remote server sent BYE but didn't immediately disconnect, it
    could cause infinite busy-loop.
  - lib-index: Corrupted cache record size in dovecot.index.cache file
    could have caused a crash (segfault) when accessing it.
  - lib-oauth2: JWT token time validation now works correctly with
    32-bit systems.
  - lib-ssl-iostream: Checking hostnames against an SSL certificate was
    case-sensitive.
  - lib-storage: Corrupted mime.parts in dovecot.index.cache may have
    resulted in Panic: file imap-bodystructure.c: line 206 (part_write_body):
    assertion failed: (text == ((part->flags & MESSAGE_PART_FLAG_TEXT) != 0))
  - lib-storage: Index rebuilding (e.g. via doveadm force-resync) didn't
    preserve the "hdr-pop3-uidl" header. Because of this, the next pop3
    session could have accessed all of the emails' metadata to read their
    POP3 UIDL (opening dbox files).
  - listescape: When using the listescape plugin and a shared namespace
    the plugin didn't work properly anymore resulting in errors like:
    "Invalid mailbox name: Name must not have '/' character."
  - lmtp: Connection crashes if connection gets disconnected due to
    multiple bad commands and the last bad command is BDAT.
  - lmtp: The Dovecot-specific LMTP parameter XRCPTFORWARD was blindly
    forwarded by LMTP proxy without checking that the backend has support.
    This caused a command parameter error from the backend if it was
    running an older Dovecot release. This could only occur in more complex
    setups where the message was proxied twice; when the proxy generated
    the XRCPTFORWARD parameter itself the problem did not occur, so this
    only happened when it was forwarded.
  - lmtp: The LMTP proxy crashes with a panic when the remote server
    replies with an error while the mail is still being forwarded through
    a DATA/BDAT command.
  - lmtp: Username may have been missing from lmtp log line prefixes when
    it was performing autoexpunging.
  - master: Dovecot would incorrectly fail with haproxy 2.0.14 service
    checks.
  - master: Systemd service: Dovecot announces readiness for accepting
    connections earlier than it should. The following environment variables
    are now imported automatically and can be omitted from
    import_environment setting: NOTIFY_SOCKET LISTEN_FDS LISTEN_PID.
  - master: service { process_min_avail } was launching processes too
    slowly when master was forking a lot of processes.
  - util: Make the health-check.sh example script POSIX shell compatible.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.15
  * CVE-2020-28200: Sieve interpreter is not protected against abusive
    scripts that claim excessive resource usage. Fixed by limiting the
    user CPU time per single script execution and cumulatively over
    several script runs within a configurable timeout period. Sufficiently
    large CPU time usage is summed in the Sieve script binary and execution
    is blocked when the sum exceeds the limit within that time. The block
    is lifted when the script is updated after the resource usage times out.
  * Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
    They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix.
  - managesieve: Commands pipelined together with and just after the
    authenticate command cause these commands to be executed twice.

Thu Mar  4 10:28:11 UTC 2021 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.14 and pigeonhole to 0.5.14
  * removed obsolete fix-timeval_cmp_margin-for-32bit-systems.patch

  Dovecot 2.3.14
  * Added new aliases for some variables. Usage of the old ones is possible,
    but discouraged. (These were partially added already to v2.3.13.)
    See https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/config_file/config_variables/
    for more information.
  * Optimize imap/pop3/submission/managesieve proxies to use less CPU at
    the cost of extra memory usage.
  * Remove autocreate, expire, snarf and mail-filter plugins.
  * Remove cydir storage driver.
  * Remove XZ/LZMA write support. Read support will be removed in future release.
  * doveadm -D: Add timestamps to debug output even when LOG_STDERR_TIMESTAMP
    environment variable is not set. Timestamp format is taken from
    log_timestamp setting.
  * If BROKENCHAR or listescape plugin is used, the escaped folder names
    may be slightly different from before in some situations. This is
    unlikely to cause issues, although caching clients may redownload the
    folders.
  * imapc: It now enables BROKENCHAR=~ by default to escape remote folder
    names if necessary. This also means that if there are any '~'
    characters in the remote folder names, they will be visible as "~7e".
  * imapc: When using local index files folder names were escaped on
    filesystem a bit differently. This affects only if there are folder
    names that actually require escaping, which isn't so common. The old
    style folders will be automatically deleted from filesystem.
  * stats: Update exported metrics to be compliant with OpenMetrics standard.
  + doveadm: Add an optional '-p' parameter to metadata list command. If
    enabled, "/private", and "/shared" metadata prefixes will be prepended
    to the keys in the list output.
  + doveconf: Support environment variables in config files. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/config_file/config_file_syntax/#environment-variables
    for more details.
  + indexer-worker: Change indexer to disconnect from indexer-worker
    after each request. This allows service indexer-worker's service_count &
    idle_kill settings to work. These can be used to restart indexer-worker
    processes once in a while to reduce their memory usage.
  - auth: "nodelay" with various authentication mechanisms such as apop
    and digest-md5 crashed AUTH process if authentication failed.
  - auth: Auth lua script generating an error triggered an assertion
    failure: Panic: file db-lua.c: line 630 (auth_lua_call_password_verify):
    assertion failed: (lua_gettop(script->L) == 0).
  - configure: Fix libunwind detection to work on other than x86_64 systems.
  - doveadm-server: Process could crash if logging was done outside command
    handling. For example http-client could have done debug logging
    afterwards, resulting in either segfault or Panic:
    file http-client.c: line 642 (http_client_context_close):
    assertion failed: (cctx->clients_list == NULL).
  - dsync: Folder name escaping with BROKENCHAR didn't work completely
    correctly. This especially caused problems with dsync-migrations using
    imapc where some of the remote folder names may not have been accessible.
  - dsync: doveadm sync + imapc doesn't always sync all mails when doing
    an incremental sync (-1), which could lead to mail loss when it's used
    for migration. This happens only when GUIDs aren't used (i.e.
    imapc without imapc_features=guid-forced).
  - fts-tika: When tika server returns error, some mails cause Panic:
    file message-parser.c: line 802 (message_parser_deinit_from_parts):
    assertion failed: (ctx->nested_parts_count == 0 || i_stream_have_bytes_left(ctx->input))
  - lib-imap: imapc parsing illegal BODYSTRUCTUREs with NILs could have
    resulted in crashes. This exposed that Dovecot was wrongly accepting
    atoms in "nstring" handling. Changed the IMAP parsing to be more
    strict about this now.
  - lib-index: If dovecot.index.cache has corrupted message size, fetching
    BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE may cause assert-crash:
    Panic: file index-mail.c: line 1140 (index_mail_parse_body_finish):
    assertion failed: (mail->data.parts != NULL).
  - lib-index: Minor error handling and race condition fixes related to
    rotating dovecot.index.log. These didn't usually cause problems,
    unless the log files were rotated rapidly.
  - lib-lua: Lua scripts using coroutines or lua libraries using coroutines
    (e.g., cqueues) panicked.
  - Message PREVIEW handled whitespace wrong so first space would get
    eaten from between words.
  - FTS and message PREVIEW (snippet) parsed HTML &entities case-sensitively.
  - lib-mail: When max nested MIME parts were reached, IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE
    was written in a way that may have caused confusion for IMAP clients
    and also Dovecot itself when parsing it. The truncated part is now
    written out using application/octet-stream MIME type.
  - lib-oauth2: HS512 and HS384 JWT token algorithms crash when you try to
    use them: Panic: file hmac.c: line 26 (hmac_init): assertion failed:
    (meth->context_size <= MAC_MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE).
  - event filters: NOT keyword did not have the correct associativity.
    NOT a AND b were getting parsed as NOT (a AND b) instead of
    (NOT a) AND b.
  - Ignore ECONNRESET when closing socket. This avoids logging useless
    errors on systems like FreeBSD.
  - event filters: event filter syntax error may lead to Panic:
    file event-filter.c: line 137 (event_filter_parse): assertion failed:
    (state.output == NULL)
  - lib: timeval_cmp_margin() was broken on 32-bit systems. This could
    potentially have caused HTTP timeouts to be handled incorrectly.
  - log: instance_name wasn't used as syslog ident by the log process.
  - master: After a service reached process_limit and client_limit, it
    could have taken up to 1 second to realize that more client connections
    became available. During this time client connections could have been
    unnecessarily rejected and a warning logged:
    Warning: service(...): process_limit (...) reached, client connections are being dropped
  - stats: Crash would occur when generating openmetrics data for metrics
    using aggregating functions.
  - stats: Event filters comparing against empty strings crash the stats
    process.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.14
  * IMAP FILTER command: cmd-filter-sieve - Do not allow NIL as
    script name argument.

- update to 2.3.13 and pigeonhole to 0.5.13

  Dovecot 2.3.13
  * CVE-2020-24386: Specially crafted command can cause IMAP hibernate to
    allow logged in user to access other people's emails and filesystem
    information.
  * Metric filter and global event filter variable syntax changed to a
    SQL-like format. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/event_filter/
  * auth: Added new aliases for %{variables}. Usage of the old ones is
    possible, but discouraged.
  * auth: Removed RPA auth mechanism, SKEY auth mechanism, NTLM auth
    mechanism and related password schemes.
  * auth: Removed passdb-sia, passdb-vpopmail and userdb-vpopmail.
  * auth: Removed postfix postmap socket
  + auth: Added new fields for auth server events. These fields are now
    also available for all auth events. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#authentication-server
    for details.
  + imap-hibernate: Added imap_client_hibernated, imap_client_unhibernated
    and imap_client_unhibernate_retried events. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/ for details.
  + lib-index: Added new mail_index_recreated event. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#mail-index-recreated
  + lib-sql: Support TLS options for cassandra driver. This requires
    cpp-driver v2.15 (or later) to work reliably.
  + lib-storage: Missing $HasAttachment / $HasNoAttachment flags are now
    added to existing mails if mail_attachment_detection_option=add-flags
    and it can be done inexpensively.
  + login proxy: Added login_proxy_max_reconnects setting (default 3) to
    control how many reconnections are attempted.
  + login proxy: imap/pop3/submission/managesieve proxying now supports
    reconnection retrying on more than just connect() failure. Any error
    except a non-temporary authentication failure will result in reconnect
    attempts.
  - auth: Lua passdb/userdb leaks stack elements per call, eventually
    causing the stack to become too deep and crashing the auth or
    auth-worker process.
  - auth: SASL authentication PLAIN mechanism could be used to trigger
    read buffer overflow. However, this doesn't seem to be exploitable in
    any way.
  - auth: v2.3.11 regression: GSSAPI authentication fails because dovecot
    disallows NUL bytes for it.
  - dict: Process used too much CPU when iterating keys, because each key
    used a separate write() syscall.
  - doveadm-server: Crash could occur if logging was done outside command
    handling. For example http-client could have done debug logging
    afterwards, resulting in either segfault or
    Panic: file http-client.c: line 642 (http_client_context_close):
    assertion failed: (cctx->clients_list == NULL).
  - doveadm-server: v2.3.11 regression: Trying to connect to doveadm server
    process via starttls assert-crashed if there were no ssl=yes listeners:
    Panic: file master-service-ssl.c: line 22 (master_service_ssl_init):
    assertion failed: (service->ssl_ctx_initialized).
  - fts-solr: HTTP requests may have assert-crashed:
    Panic: file http-client-request.c: line 1232
    (http_client_request_send_more):
    assertion failed: (req->payload_input != NULL)
  - imap: IMAP NOTIFY could crash with a segmentation fault due to a bad
    configuration that causes errors. Sending the error responses to the
    client can cause the segmentation fault. This can for example happen
    when several namespaces use the same mail storage location.
  - imap: IMAP NOTIFY used on a shared namespace that doesn't actually
    exist (e.g. public namespace for a nonexistent user) can crash with a
    panic:
    Panic: Leaked view for index /tmp/home/asdf/mdbox/dovecot.list.index:
    Opened in (null):0
  - imap: IMAP session can crash with QRESYNC extension if many changes
    are done before asking for expunged mails since last sync.
  - imap: Process might hang indefinitely if client disconnects after
    sending some long-running commands pipelined, for example FETCH+LOGOUT.
  - lib-compress: Mitigate crashes when configuring a not compiled in
    compression. Errors with compression configuration now distinguish
    between not supported and unknown.
  - lib-compression: Using xz/lzma compression in v2.3.11 could have
    written truncated output in some situations. This would result in
    "Broken pipe" read errors when trying to read it back.
  - lib-compression: zstd compression could have crashed in some situations:
    Panic: file ostream.c: line 287 (o_stream_sendv_int): assertion
    failed: (!stream->blocking)
  - lib-dict: dict client could have crashed in some rare situations when
    iterating keys.
  - lib-http: Fix several assert-crashes in HTTP client.
  - lib-index: v2.3.11 regression: When mails were expunged at the same
    time as lots of new content was being saved to the cache (e.g. cache
    file was lost and is being re-filled) a deadlock could occur with
    dovecot.index.cache / dovecot.index.log.
  - lib-index: v2.3.11 regression: dovecot.index.cache file was being
    purged (rewritten) too often when it had a field that hadn't been
    accessed for over 1 month, but less than 2 months. Every cache file
    change caused a purging in this situation.
  - lib-mail: MIME parts were not returned correctly by Dovecot MIME parser.
    Regression caused by fixing CVE-2020-12100.
  - lib-mail: When max nested MIME parts were reached, IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE
    was written in a way that may have caused confusion for both IMAP
    clients and Dovecot itself when parsing it. The truncated part is now
    written out using application/octet-stream MIME type.
  - lib-mail: v2.3.11 regression: Mail delivery / parsing crashed when the
    10000th MIME part was message/rfc822 (or if parent was multipart/digest):
    Panic: file message-parser.c: line 167 (message_part_append):
    assertion failed: (ctx->total_parts_count <= ctx->max_total_mime_parts).
  - lib-oauth2: Dovecot incorrectly required oauth2 server introspection
    reply to contain username with invalid token.
  - lib-ssl-iostream, lib-dcrypt: Fix building with OpenSSL that has
    deprecated APIs disabled.
  - lib-storage: When mail's size is different from the cached one (in
    dovecot.index.cache or Maildir S=size in the filename), this is
    handled by logging "Cached message size smaller/larger than expected"
    error. However, in some situations this also ended up crashing with:
    Panic: file istream.c: line 315 (i_stream_read_memarea):
    assertion failed: (old_size <= _stream->pos - _stream->skip).
  - lib-storage: v2.3 regression: Copying/moving mails was taking much more
    memory than before. This was mainly visible when copying/moving
    thousands of mails in a single transaction.
  - lib-storage: v2.3.11 regression: Searching messages assert-crashed
    (without FTS): Panic: file message-parser.c: line 174
    (message_part_finish):
    assertion failed: (ctx->nested_parts_count > 0).
  - lib: Dovecot v2.3 moved signal handlers around in ioloops,
    causing more CPU usage than in v2.2.
  - lib: Fixed JSON parsing: '\' escape sequence may have wrongly resulted
    in error if it happened to be at read boundary. Any NUL characters and
    '\u0000' will now result in parsing error instead of silently
    truncating the data.
  - lmtp, submission: Server may hang if SSL client connection disconnects
    during the delivery. If this happened repeated, it could have ended
    up reaching process_limit and preventing any further lmtp/submission
    deliveries.
  - lmtp: Proxy does not always properly log TLS connection problems as
    errors; in some cases, only a debug message is logged if enabled.
  - lmtp: The LMTP service can hang when commands are pipelined. This can
    particularly occur when one command in the middle of the pipeline fails.
    One example of this occurs for proxied LMTP transactions in which the
    final DATA or BDAT command is pipelined after a failing RCPT command.
  - login-proxy: The login_source_ips setting has no effect, and therefore
    the proxy source IPs are not cycled through as they should be.
  - master: Process was using 100% CPU in some situations when a broken
    service was being throttled.
  - pop3-login: POP3 login would fail with "Input buffer full" if the
    initial response for SASL was too long.
  - stats: Crash would occur when generating openmetrics data for metrics
    using aggregating functions.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.13
  - duplicate: The test was handled badly in a multiscript (sieve_before,
    sieve_after) scenario in which an earlier script in the sequence with
    a duplicate test succeeded, while a later script caused a runtime
    failure. In that case, the message is recorded for duplicate tracking,
    while the message may not actually have been delivered in the end.
  - editheader: Sieve interpreter entered infinite loop at startup when
    the "editheader" configuration listed an invalid header name. This
    problem can only be triggered by the administrator.
  - relational: The Sieve relational extension can cause a segfault at
    compile time. This is triggered by invalid script syntax. The segfault
    happens when this match type is the last argument of the test command.
    This situation is not possible in a valid script; positional arguments
    are normally present after that, which would prevent the segfault.
  - sieve: For some Sieve commands the provided mailbox name is not
    properly checked for UTF-8 validity, which can cause assert crashes at
    runtime when an invalid mailbox name is encountered. This can be
    caused by the user by writing a bad Sieve script involving the
    affected commands ("mailboxexists", "specialuse_exists").
    This can be triggered by the remote sender only when the user has
    written a Sieve script that passes message content to one of the
    affected commands.
  - sieve: Large sequences of 8-bit octets passed to certain Sieve
    commands that create or modify message headers that allow UTF-8 text
    (vacation, notify and addheader) can cause the delivery or IMAP
    process (when IMAPSieve is used) to enter a memory-consuming
    semi-infinite loop that ends when the process exceeds its memory
    limits. Logged in users can cause these hangs only for their own
    processes.

  Dovecot 2.3.11.3
  - pop3-login: Login didn't handle commands in multiple IP packets properly.
    This mainly affected large XCLIENT commands or a large SASL initial
    response parameter in the AUTH command.
  - pop3: pop3_deleted_flag setting was broken, causing:
    Panic: file seq-range-array.c: line 472 (seq_range_array_invert):
    assertion failed: (range[count-1].seq2 <= max_seq)
  Dovecot 2.3.11.2
  - auth: Lua passdb/userdb leaks stack elements per call, eventually
    causing the stack to become too deep and crashing the auth or
    auth-worker process.
  - lib-mail: v2.3.11 regression: MIME parts not returned correctly by
    Dovecot MIME parser.
  - pop3-login: Login would fail with "Input buffer full" if the initial
    response for SASL was too long.
  Dovecot 2.3.11
  * CVE-2020-12100: Parsing mails with a large number of MIME parts could
    have resulted in excessive CPU usage or a crash due to running out of
    stack memory.
  * CVE-2020-12673: Dovecot's NTLM implementation does not correctly check
    message buffer size, which leads to reading past allocation which can
    lead to crash.
  * CVE-2020-10967: lmtp/submission: Issuing the RCPT command with an
    address that has the empty quoted string as local-part causes the lmtp
    service to crash.
  * CVE-2020-12674: Dovecot's RPA mechanism implementation accepts
    zero-length message, which leads to assert-crash later on.
  * Events: Fix inconsistency in events. See event documentation in
    https://doc.dovecot.org.
  * imap_command_finished event's cmd_name field now contains "unknown"
    for unknown commands. A new "cmd_input_name" field contains the
    command name exactly as it was sent.
  * lib-index: Renamed mail_cache_compress_* settings to mail_cache_purge_*.
    Note that these settings are mainly intended for testing and usually
    shouldn't be changed.
  * events: Renamed "index" event category to "mail-index".
  * events: service:<name> category is now using the name from
    configuration file.
  * dns-client: service dns_client was renamed to dns-client.
  * log: Prefixes generally use the service name from configuration file.
    For example dict-async service will now use
    "dict-async(pid): " log prefix instead of "dict(pid): "
  * *-login: Changed logging done by proxying to use a consistent prefix
    containing the IP address and port.
  * *-login: Changed disconnection log messages to be slightly clearer.
  + dict: Add events for dictionaries.
  + lib-index: Finish logging with events.
  + oauth2: Support local validation of JWT tokens.
  + stats: Add support for dynamic histograms and grouping. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/stats/.
  + imap: Implement RFC 8514: IMAP SAVEDATE
  + lib-index: If a long-running transaction (e.g. SORT/FETCH on a huge
    folder) adds a lot of data to dovecot.index.cache file, commit those
    changes periodically to make them visible to other concurrent sessions
    as well.
  + stats: Add OpenMetrics exporter for statistics. See
    https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/stats/openmetrics/.
  + stats: Support disabling stats-writer socket by setting
    stats_writer_socket_path="".
  - auth-worker: Process keeps slowly increasing its memory usage and
    eventually dies with "out of memory" due to reaching vsz_limit.
  - auth: Prevent potential timing attacks in authentication secret
    comparisons: OAUTH2 JWT-token HMAC, imap-urlauth token, crypt() result.
  - auth: Several auth-mechanisms allowed input to be truncated by NUL
    which can potentially lead to unintentional issues or even successful
    logins which should have failed.
  - auth: When auth policy returned a delay, auth_request_finished event
    had policy_result=ok field instead of policy_result=delayed.
  - auth: auth process crash when auth_policy_server_url is set to an
    invalid URL.
  - dict-ldap: Crash occurs if var_expand template expansion fails.
  - dict: If dict client disconnected while iteration was still running,
    dict process could have started using 100% CPU, although it was still
    handling clients.
  - doveadm: Running doveadm commands via proxying may hang, especially
    when doveadm is printing a lot of output.
  - imap: "MOVE * destfolder" goes to a loop copying the last mail to the
    destination until the imap process dies due to running out of memory.
  - imap: Running "UID MOVE 1:* Trash" on an empty folder goes to infinite
    loop.
  - imap: SEARCH doesn't support $.
  - lib-compress: Buffer over-read in zlib stream read.
  - lib-dns: If DNS lookup times out, lib-dns can cause crash in calling
    process.
  - lib-index: Fixed several bugs in dovecot.index.cache handling that
    could have caused cached data to be lost.
  - lib-index: Writing to >=1 GB dovecot.index.cache files may cause
    assert-crashes:
    Panic: file mail-index-util.c: line 37 (mail_index_uint32_to_offset):
    assertion failed: (offset < 0x40000000)
  - lib-ssl-iostream: Fix buggy OpenSSL error handling without
    assert-crashing. If there is no error available, log it as an error
    instead of crashing:
    Panic: file iostream-openssl.c: line 599 (openssl_iostream_handle_error):
    assertion failed: (errno != 0)
  - lib-ssl-iostream: ssl_key_password setting did not work.
  - submission: A segfault crash may occur when the client or server
    disconnects while a non-transaction command like NOOP or VRFY is still
    being processed.
  - virtual: Copying/moving mails with IMAP into a virtual folder assert-crashes:
    Panic: file cmd-copy.c: line 152 (fetch_and_copy): assertion failed:
    (copy_ctx->copy_count == seq_range_count(&copy_ctx->saved_uids))

  Pigeonhole 0.5.11
  * managesieve: managesieve_max_line_length setting is now a "size" type
    instead of just number of bytes. This allows using e.g. "64k" as the
    value.
  - lib-sieve: When folding white space is used in the Message-ID header,
    it is not stripped away correctly before the message ID value is used,
    causing e.g. garbled log lines at delivery.

Fri Mar  6 11:14:00 UTC 2020 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

- update to 2.3.10 and pigeonhole to 0.5.10

  Dovecot 2.3.10
  * Disable retpoline migitations by default. These can cause severe
    performance regressions, so they should be only enabled when
    applicable.
  * IMAP MOVE now commits transactions in batches of 1000 mails. This
    helps especially with lazy_expunge when moving a lot of mails. It
    mainly avoids situations where multiple IMAP sessions are running the
    same MOVE command and duplicating the mails in the lazy_expunge folder.
    With this change there can still be some duplication, but the MOVE
    always progresses forward. Also if the MOVE fails at some point, the
    changes up to the last 1000 mails are still committed instead of
    rolled back. Note that the COPY command behavior hasn't changed,
    because it is required by IMAP standard to be an atomic operation.
  * IMAP EXPUNGE and CLOSE now expunges mails in batches of 1000 mails.
    This helps especially with lazy_expunge when expunging a lot of mails
    (e.g. millions) to make sure that the progress always moves forward
    even if the process is killed.
  * Autoexpunging now expunges mails in batches of 1000 mails. This helps
    especially with lazy_expunge when expunging a lot of mails
    (e.g. millions) to make sure that the progress always moves forward
    even if the process is killed.
  + Add tool for generating sysreport called dovecot-sysreport.
    This generates a bundle of information usually needed for support
    requests.
  + Add support for the new IMAP \Important SPECIAL-USE flag (RFC 8457).
  + Add metric { group_by } setting. This allows automatically creating
    new metrics based on the fields you want to group statistics by.
    NOTE: This feature is considered experimental and syntax is subject
    to change in future release.
  + auth: Support SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism.
  + imap: Support the new IMAP STATUS=SIZE extension.
  + Use TCP_QUICKACK to reduce latency for some TCP connections.
  + quota-status: Made the service more robust against erroneous use with
    Postfix ACL policies other than smtpd_recipient_restrictions.
  + Add "revision" field support to imap_id_send setting. Using
    "revision *" will send in IMAP ID command response the short commit
    hash of the Dovecot git source tree HEAD (same as in dovecot --version).
  + IMAP ENVELOPE includes now all addresses when there are multiple
    headers (From, To, Cc, etc.) The standard way of having multiple
    addresses is to just list them all in a single header. It's
    non-standard to have multiple headers. However, since MTAs allow these
    mails to pass through and different software may handle them in
    different ways, it's better from security point of view to show all
    the addresses.
  + Event filters now support using "field_name=" to match a field that
    doesn't exist or has an empty value. For example use "error=" to match
    only events that didn't fail.
  - acl: INBOX ACLs shouldn't apply for IMAP GETMETADATA/SETMETADATA
    commands.
  - cassandra: CASS_ERROR_SERVER_WRITE_FAILURE error should also be
    treated as "uncertain write failure".
  - dict-redis: Using quota_clone configured with dict-redis could have
    crashed when Redis responded slowly.
  - fts-solr: The XML response parser fails to parse large/chunked responses
    correctly. This leads to spurious parse errors, most notably: "Error:
    fts_solr: received invalid uid '0'".
  - imap-hibernate: Communication trouble with imap-master leads to
    segfault.
  - imap-hibernate: Unhibernation retrying wasn't working.
  - imap: Fixed auth lookup privilege problem when imap process was reused
    and user was being un-hibernated.
  - Fix potential crash when copying/moving mails within the same folder.
    This happened only when there were a lot of fields in dovecot.index.cache.
  - lib-index: Recreating dovecot.index.cache file could have crashed when
    merging bitmask fields.
  - lib-index: Using public/shared folders with INDEXPVT configured to use
    private \Seen flags, trying to search seen/unseen in an empty folder
    crashes with segfault.
  - lib-mail: Large base64-encoded mails weren't decoded properly.
    This could have affected searching/indexing mails and message snippet
    generation.
  - lib-mail: Message with only quoted text could have caused message
    snippet to ignore its 200 character limit and return the entire
    message. This was added also to dovecot.index.cache file, which
    increased disk space and memory usage unnecessarily.
    v2.3.9.2 regression (previous versions cached the quoted snippet as
    empty). In a large mail quoted text could have become wrongly added
    to the snippet, possibly mixed together with non-quoted text.
  - lib-smtp: client could have assert-crashed if STARTTLS handshake
    finished earlier than usually.
  - lib-ssl-iostream: remove -static flag for lib-ssl-iostream linking to
    prevent a compile issue.
  - lib-storage: Mailbox synchronization may have assert-crashed in some
    rare situations.
  - lib-storage: mdbox didn't preserve date.saved with dsync.
  - lib: Don't require EAI_{ADDRFAMILY,NODATA}, breaks FreeBSD
  - master: Some services could respawn unthrottled if they crash during
    startup.
  - push-notification: Do not send push_notification_finished event if
    nothing was done. This happens when mail transaction is started and
    ended with no changes.
  - quota-status: Addresses with special characters in the local part caused
    problems in the interaction between Postfix and Dovecot. Postfix sent
    its own internal representation in the recipient field, while Dovecot
    expected a valid RFC5321 mailbox address.
  - submission-login: SESSION was not correctly encoded field for the
    XCLIENT command. Particularly, a '+' character introduced by the
    session ID's Base64 encoding causes problems.
  - submission: Fix submission_max_mail_size to work correctly on 32-bit
    systems.
  - submission: Trusted connections crashed in second connection's EHLO
    if submission-login { service_count } is something else than 1 (which
    is the default).
  - submission: XCLIENT command was never used in the protocol exchange
    with the relay MTA when submission_backend_capabilities is configured,
    even when the relay MTA was properly configured to accept the XCLIENT
    command.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.10
  * imap_sieve_filter: Change result action logging to include IMAP UID

Wed Dec  4 21:46:28 UTC 2019 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.9 and pigeonhole to 0.5.9

  Dovecot 2.3.9
  * Changed several event field names for consistency and to avoid
    conflicts in parent-child event relationships:
     * SMTP server command events: Renamed "name" to "cmd_name"
     * Events inheriting from a mailbox: Renamed "name" to "mailbox"
     * Server connection events have only "remote_ip", "remote_port",
       "local_ip" and "local_port".
     * Removed duplicate "client_ip", "ip" and "port".
     * Mail storage events: Removed "service" field.
       Use "service:<name>" category instead.
     * HTTP client connection events: Renamed "host" to "dest_host" and
       "port" to "dest_port"
  * auth: Drop Postfix socketmap support. It hasn't been working
    with recent Postfix versions for a while now.
  * push-notification-lua: The "subject" field is now decoded to UTF8
    instead of kept as MIME-encoded.
  + push-notification-lua: Added new "from_address", "from_display_name",
    "to_address" and "to_display_name" fields. The display names are
    decoded to UTF8.
  + Added various new fields to existing events.
    See http://doc.dovecot.net/admin_manual/list_of_events.html
  + Add lmtp_add_received_header setting. It can be used to prevent LMTP
    from adding "Received:" headers.
  + doveadm: Support SSL/STARTTLS for proxied doveadm connections based on
    doveadm_ssl setting and proxy ssl/tls settings.
  + Log filters support now "service:<name>", which matches all events for
    the given service. It can also be used as a category.
  + lib: Use libunwind to get abort backtraces with function names
    where available.
  + lmtp: When the LMTP proxy changes the username (from passdb lookup)
    add an appropriate ORCPT parameter.
  - lmtp: Add lmtp_client_workarounds setting to implement workarounds for
    clients that send MAIL and RCPT commands with additional spaces before
    the path and for clients that omit <> brackets around the path.
    See example-config/conf.d/20-lmtp.conf.
  - lda/lmtp: Invalid MAIL FROM addresses were rejcted too aggressively.
    Now mails from addresses with unicode characters are delivered, but
    their Return-Path header will be <> instead of the given MAIL FROM
    address.
  - lmtp: The lmtp_hdr_delivery_address setting is ignored.
  - imap: imap_command_finished event's "args" and "human_args" parameters
    were always empty.
  - mbox: Seeking in zlib and bzip2 compressed input streams didn't work
    correctly.
  - imap-hibernate: Process crashed when client got destroyed while it was
    attempted to be unhibernated, and the unhibernation fails.
  - *-login: Proxying may have crashed if SSL handshake to the backend
    failed immediately. This was unlikely to happen in normal operation.
  - *-login: If TLS handshake to upstream server failed during proxying,
    login process could crash due to invalid memory access.
  - *-login: v2.3 regression: Using SASL authentication without initial
    response may have caused SSL connections to hang. This happened often
    at least with PHP's IMAP library.
  - *-login: When login processes are flooded with authentication attempts
    it starts logging errors about "Authentication server sent unknown id".
    This is still expected. However, it also caused the login process to
    disconnect from auth server and potentially log some user's password
    in the error message.
  - dict-sql: SQL prepared statements were not shared between sessions.
    This resulted in creating a lot of prepared statements, which was
    especially inefficient when using Cassandra backend with a lot of
    Cassandra nodes.
  - auth: auth_request_finished event didn't have success=yes parameter
    set for successful authentications.
  - auth: userdb dict - Trying to list users crashed.
  - submission: Service could be configured to allow anonymous
    authentication mechanism and anonymous user access.
  - LAYOUT=index: Corrupted dovecot.list.index caused folder creation to
    panic.
  - doveadm: HTTP server crashes if request target starts with double "/".
  - dsync: Remote dsync started hanging if the initial doveadm
    "dsync-server" command was sent in the same TCP packet as the
    following dsync handshake. v2.3.8 regression.
  - lib: Several "input streams" had a bug that in some rare situations
    might cause it to access freed memory. This could lead to crashes or
    corruption.
    The only currently known effect of this is that using zlib plugin with
    external mail attachments (mail_attachment_dir) could cause fetching
    the mail to return a few bytes of garbage data at the beginning of the
    header. Note that the mail wasn't saved corrupted, but fetching it
    caused corrupted mail to be sent to the client.
  - lib-storage: If a mail only has quoted content, use the quoted text
    for generating message snippet (IMAP PREVIEW) instead of returning
    empty snippet.
  - lib-storage: When vsize header was rebuilt, newly calculated message
    sizes were added to dovecot.index.cache instead of being directly
    saved into vsize records in dovecot.index.
  - lib: JSON generator was escaping UTF-8 characters unnecessarily.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.8
  + Added events for Sieve and ManageSieve, see
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#pigeonhole
  + Pigeonhole: Implement the Sieve "special-use" extension described in
    RFC 8579.
  - duplicate: Test only compared the handles which would cause
    different values to be cached as the same duplicate test. Fix to also
    compare the actual hashes.
  - imap_sieve_filter: IMAP FILTER Command had various bugs in error
    handling. Errors may have been duplicated for each email, errors
    may have been missing entirely, command tag and ERRORS/WARNINGS
    parameters were swapped.

Tue Oct  8 17:31:00 UTC 2019 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.8 and pigeonhole to 0.5.8

  Dovecot 2.3.8
  + Added mail_delivery_started and mail_delivery_finished events, see
    https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/ for details.
  + dsync-replication: Don't replicate users who have "noreplicate" extra
    field in userdb.
  + doveadm service status: Show total number of processes created.
  + When logging to syslog, use instance_name setting's value for the
    ident. This commonly is added as a log prefix.
  + Base64 encoding/decoding code was rewritten with additional features.
    It shouldn't cause any user visible changes.
  - v2.3.7 regression: If a folder only receives new mails without any
    other mail access, dovecot.index.log keeps growing forever and
    dovecot.index keeps being rewritten for every mail delivery.
  - dsync-replication may lose keywords after syncing mails restored from
    another replica. This only happened if the mail only had keywords and
    no system flags.
  - event filters: Non-textual event fields could not be filtered using
    wildcards.
  - auth: Scope parameter was missing from OAuth password grant
    request.
  - doveadm client-server communication may hang in some situations.
    It is also using unnecessarily small TCP/IP packet sizes.
  - doveadm who and kick did not flush protocol output correctly.
  - imap: SETMETADATA with literal value would delete the metadata value
    instead of updating it.
  - imap: When client issues FETCH PREVIEW (LAZY=FUZZY) command, the
    caching decisions should be updated so that newly saved mails will
    have the preview cached.
  - With mail_nfs_index=yes and/or mail_nfs_storage=yes setuid/setgid
    permission bits in some files may have become dropped with some NFS
    servers. Changed NFS flushing to now use chmod() instead of chown().
  - quota: warnings did not work if quota root was noenforcing
  - acl: Global ACL file ignored the last line if it didn't end with LF.
  - doveadm stats dump: With JSON formatter output numbers using the
    number type instead of as strings
  - lmtp_proxy: Ensure that real_* variables are correctly set when using
    lmtp_proxy.
  - event exporter: http-post driver had hardcoded timeout and did not
    support DNS lookups or TLS connections.
  - auth: Fix user iteration to work with userdb passwd with glibc v2.28.
  - auth: auth service can crash if auth-policy JSON response is invalid
    or returned too fast.
  - In some rare situations "ps" output could have shown a lot of "?"
    characters after Dovecot process titles.
  - When dovecot.index.pvt is empty, an unnecessary error is logged:
    Error: .../dovecot.index.pvt reset, view is now inconsistent
  - SMTP address encoder duplicated initial double quote character when
    the localpart of an address ended in '..'. For example
    "user+..@example.com" became ""user+.."@example.com in a
    sieve redirect.

  Pigeonhole 0.5.8
  - Sieve may leak resources in rare cases when a redirect, vacation or
    report action fails to send the message. This mainly applies when
    Sieve is executed in IMAP context; i.e., for the IMAPSIEVE or
    FILTER=SIEVE capabilities.

Tue Jul 23 20:06:59 UTC 2019 - Michael Str√∂der <michael@stroeder.com>

- update to 2.3.7.1 and pigeonhole to 0.5.7.1
  Dovecot 2.3.7.1
    - Fix TCP_NODELAY errors being logged on non-Linux OSes
    - lmtp proxy: Fix assert-crash when client uses BODY=8BITMIME
    - Remove wrongly added checks in namespace prefix checking
  Pigeonhole 0.5.7.1
    - dsync: Sieve script syncing failed if mailbox attributes weren't enabled.
  Dovecot 2.3.7
    * fts-solr: Removed break-imap-search parameter
    + Added more events for the new statistics, see
      https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/
    + mail-lua: Add IMAP metadata accessors, see
      https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/lua/
    + Add event exporters that allow exporting raw events to log files and
      external systems, see
      https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/event_export/
    + SNIPPET is now PREVIEW and size has been increased to 200 characters.
    + Add body option to fts_enforced. This triggers building FTS index only
      on body search, and an error using FTS index fails the search rather
      than reads through all the mails.
    - Submission/LMTP: Fixed crash when domain argument is invalid in a
      second EHLO/LHLO command.
    - Copying/moving mails using Maildir format loses IMAP keywords in the
      destination if the mail also has no system flags.
    - mail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save caused email body
      to be unnecessarily opened when FETCHing mail headers that were
      already cached.
    - mail attachment detection keywords not saved with maildir.
    - dovecot.index.cache may have grown excessively large in some
      situations. This happened especially when using autoexpunging with
      lazy_expunge folders. Also with mdbox format in general the cache file
      wasn't recreated as often as it should have.
    - Autoexpunged mails weren't immediately deleted from the disk. Instead,
      the deletion from disk happened the next time the folder was opened.
      This could have caused unnecessary delays if the opening was done by
      an interactive IMAP session.
    - Dovecot's TCP connections sometimes add extra 40ms latency due to not
      enabling TCP_NODELAY. HTTP and SMTP/LMTP connections weren't
      affected, but everything else was. This delay wasn't always visible -
      only in some situations with some message/packet sizes.
    - imapc: Fix various crash conditions
    - Dovecot builds were not always reproducible.
    - login-proxy: With shutdown_clients=no after config reload the
      existing connections could no longer be listed or kicked with doveadm.
    - "doveadm proxy kick" with -f parameter caused a crash in some
      situations.
    - Auth policy can cause segmentation fault crash during auth process
      shutdown if all auth requests have not been finished.
    - Fix various minor bugs leading into incorrect behaviour in mailbox
      list index handling. These rarely caused noticeable problems.
    - LDAP auth: Iteration accesses freed memory, possibly crashing
      auth-worker
    - local_name { .. } filter in dovecot.conf does not correctly support
      multiple names and wildcards were matched incorrectly.
    - replicator: dsync assert-crashes if it can't connect to remote TCP
      server.
    - config: Memory leak in config process when ssl_dh setting wasn't
      set and there was no ssl-parameters.dat file.
      This caused config process to die once in a while
      with "out of memory".

Tue Apr 30 13:49:18 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.6
  + sieve: Redirect loop prevention is sometimes ineffective.
    Improve existing loop detection by also recognizing the
    X-Sieve-Redirected-From header in incoming messages and
    dropping redirect actions when it points to the sending
    account. This header is already added by the redirect action,
    so this improvement only adds an additional use of this header.
  - sieve: Prevent execution of implicit keep upon temporary
    failure occurring at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 13:34:16 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.6: (boo#1133624 boo#1133625)
  * CVE-2019-11494: Submission-login crashed with signal 11 due to
    null pointer access when authentication was aborted by
    disconnecting.
  * CVE-2019-11499: Submission-login crashed when authentication
    was started over TLS secured channel and invalid authentication
    message was sent.
  * auth: Support password grant with passdb oauth2.
  + Use system default CAs for outbound TLS connections.
  + Simplify array handling with new helper macros.
  + fts_solr: Enable configuring batch_size and soft_commit features.
  - lmtp/submission: Fixed various bugs in XCLIENT handling,
    including a hang when XCLIENT commands were sent infinitely to
    the remote server.
  - lmtp/submission: Forwarded multi-line replies were erroneously
    sent as two replies to the client.
  - lib-smtp: client: Message was not guaranteed to contain CRLF
    consistently when CHUNKING was used.
  - fts_solr: Plugin was no longer compatible with Solr 7.
  - Make it possible to disable certificate checking without
    setting ssl_client_ca_* settings.
  - pop3c: SSL support was broken.
  - mysql: Closing connection twice lead to crash on some systems.
  - auth: Multiple oauth2 passdbs crashed auth process on deinit.
  - HTTP client connection errors infrequently triggered a
    segmentation fault when the connection was idle and not used
    for a particular client instance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 11:40:06 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5.2 (boo#1132501)
  * CVE-2019-10691: Trying to login with 8bit username containing
    invalid UTF8 input causes auth process to crash if auth policy
    is enabled. This could be used rather easily to cause a DoS.
    Similar crash also happens during mail delivery when using
    invalid UTF8 in From or Subject header when OX push
    notification driver is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 28 12:36:55 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5.1 (boo#1130116)
  * CVE-2019-7524: Missing input buffer size validation leads into
    arbitrary buffer overflow when reading fts or pop3 uidl header
    from Dovecot index. Exploiting this requires direct write
    access to the index files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  8 18:09:00 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.5
  + Lua push notification driver: mail keywords and flags are
    provided in MessageNew and MessageAppend events.
  + submission: Implement support for plugins.
  + auth: When auth_policy_log_only=yes, only log what the policy
    server response would do without actually doing it.
  + auth: Always log policy server decisions with auth_verbose=yes
  - v2.3.[34]: doveadm log errors: Output was missing user/session
  - lda: Debug log lines could have shown slightly corrupted
  - login proxy: Login processes may have crashed in various ways
    when login_proxy_max_disconnect_delay was set.
  - imap: Fix crash with Maildir+zlib if client disconnects during
    APPEND
  - lmtp proxy: Fix potential assert-crash
  - lmtp/submission: Fix crash when SMTP client transaction times
    out
  - submission: Split large XCLIENT commands to 512 bytes per
    command, so Postfix accepts them.
  - submission: Fix crash when client sends invalid BURL command
  - submission: relay backend: VRFY command: Avoid forwarding 500
    and 502 replies back to client.
  - lib-http: Fix potential assert-crash when DNS lookup fails
  - lib-fts: Fix search query generation when one language ignores
    a token (e.g. via stopwords).
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.5
  + IMAPSieve: Add new plugin/imapsieve_expunge_discarded setting
    which causes messages discarded by an IMAPSieve script to be
    expunged immediately, rather than only being marked as
    "\Deleted" (which is still the default behavior).
  - IMAPSieve: Fix panic crash occurring when a COPY command copies
    messages from a virtual mailbox where the source messages
    originate from more than a single real mailbox.
  - imap4flags extension: Fix deleting all keywords. When the
    action resulted in all keywords being removed, no changes were
    actually applied.
  - variables extension: Fix truncation of UTF-8 variable content.
    The maximum size of Sieve variables was enforced by truncating
    the variable string content bluntly at the limit, but this does
    not consider UTF-8 code point boundaries. This resulted in
    broken UTF-8 strings. This problem also surfaced for variable
    modifiers, such as the ":encodeurl" modifier provided by the
    Sieve "enotify" extension. In that case, the resulting URI
    escaping could also be truncated inappropriately.
  - IMAPSieve, IMAP FILTER=SIEVE: Fix replacing a modified message.
    Sieve scripts running in IMAPSIEVE or IMAP FILTER=SIEVE context
    that modify the message, stored the message a second time,
    rather than replacing the originally stored unmodified message.
  - Fix segmentation fault occurring when both the
    sieve_extprograms plugin (for the Sieve interpreter) and the
    imap_filter_sieve plugin (for IMAP) are loaded at the same
    time. A symbol was defined by both plugins, causing a clash
    when both were loaded.
- drop patches which were backports

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  5 13:45:52 UTC 2019 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.4.1 (boo#1123022)
  * CVE-2019-3814: If imap/pop3/managesieve/submission client has
    trusted certificate with missing username field
    (ssl_cert_username_field), under some configurations Dovecot
    mistakenly trusts the username provided via authentication
    instead of failing.
  * ssl_cert_username_field setting was ignored with external
    SMTP AUTH, because none of the MTAs (Postfix, Exim) currently
    send the cert_username field. This may have allowed users with
    trusted certificate to specify any username in the
    authentication. This bug didn't affect Dovecot's Submission
    service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 17 21:57:42 UTC 2019 - Arjen de Korte <suse+build@de-korte.org>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 25 00:17:08 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- added 10048229...de42b54a.patch:
  Fix build failures on TW i586

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 24 00:27:59 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.4
  * The default postmaster_address is now "postmaster@<user domain
    or server hostname>". If username contains the @domain part,
    that's used. If not, then the server's hostname is used.
  * "doveadm stats dump" now returns two decimals for the "avg"
    field.
  + Added push notification driver that uses a Lua script
  + Added new SQL, DNS and connection events.
    See https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Events
  + Added "doveadm mailbox cache purge" command.
  + Added events API support for Lua scripts
  + doveadm force-resync -f parameter performs "index fsck" while
    opening the index. This may be useful to fix some types of
    broken index files.  This may become the default behavior in a
    later version.
  - director: Kicking a user crashes if login process is very slow
  - pop3_no_flag_updates=no: Don't expunge DELEted and RETRed
    messages unless QUIT is sent.
  - auth: Fix crypt() segfault with glibc-2.28+
  - imap: Running UID FILTER script with errors assert-crashes
  - dsync, pop3-migration: POP3 UIDLs weren't added to
    dovecot.index.cache while mails were saved.
  - dict clients may have been using 100% CPU while waiting for
    dict server to finish commands.
  - doveadm user: Fixed user listing via HTTP API
  - All levels of Cassandra log messages were logged as Dovecot
    errors.
  - http/smtp client may have crashed after SSL handshake
  - Lua auth converted strings that looked like numbers into
    numbers.
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.4
  * Adjustments to several changes in Dovecot v2.3.4 make this
    Pigeonhole release dependent on that Dovecot release; it will
    not compile against older Dovecot versions. And, conversely,
    you need to upgrade Pigeonhole when upgrading Dovecot to
    v2.3.4.
  * The changes regarding the default postmaster_address in Dovecot
    v2.3.4 mainly apply to Pigeonhole. The new default should work
    for all existing installations, thereby fixing several reported
    v2.3/v0.5 migration problems.
  - IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix assert crash occurring when running
    UID FILTER on a Sieve script with errors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 22:55:38 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.3
  - Fix assertion panic occurring when managesieve service fails to
    open INBOX while saving a Sieve script. This was caused by a
    lack of cleanup after failure.
  - Fix specific messages causing an assert panic with actions that
    compose a reply (e.g. vacation). With some rather weird input
    from the original message, the header folding algorithm (as
    used for composing the References header for the reply) got
    confused, causing the panic.
  - IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix FILTER SIEVE SCRIPT command
    parsing.  After finishing reading the Sieve script, the command
    parsing sometimes didn't continue with the search arguments.
    This is a time- critical bug that likely only occurs when the
    Sieve script is sent in the next TCP frame.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  1 22:54:12 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- update to 2.3.3
  * doveconf hides more secrets now in the default output.
  * ssl_dh setting is no longer enforced at startup. If it's not
    set and non-ECC DH key exchange happens, error is logged and
    client is disconnected.
  + Added log_debug=<filter> setting.
  + Added log_core_filter=<log filter> setting.
  + quota-clone: Write to dict asynchronously
  + --enable-hardening attempts to use retpoline Spectre 2
    mitigations
  + lmtp proxy: Support source_ip passdb extra field.
  + doveadm stats dump: Support more fields and output stddev
    by default.
  + push-notification: Add SSL support for OX backend.
  - NUL bytes in mail headers can cause truncated replies when
    fetched.
  - director: Conflicting host up/down state changes may in some
    rare situations ended up in a loop of two directors constantly
    overwriting each others' changes.
  - director: Fix hang/crash when multiple doveadm commands are
    being handled concurrently.
  - director: Fix assert-crash if doveadm disconnects too early
  - virtual plugin: Some searches used 100% CPU for many seconds
  - dsync assert-crashed with acl plugin in some situations.
  - mail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save
    assert-crashed with some specific Sieve scripts.
  - Mail snippet generation crashed with mails containing invalid
    Content-Type:multipart header.
  - Log prefix ordering was different for some log lines.
  - quota: With noenforcing option current quota usage wasn't
    updated.
  - auth: Kerberos authentication against Samba assert-crashed.
  - stats clients were unnecessarily chatty with the stats server.
  - imapc: Fixed various assert-crashes when reconnecting to
    server.
  - lmtp, submission: Fix potential crash if client disconnects
    while handling a command.
  - quota: Fixed compiling with glibc-2.26 / support libtirpc.
  - fts-solr: Empty search values resulted in 400 Bad Request
    errors
  - fts-solr: default_ns parameter couldn't be used
  - submission server crashed if relay server returned over 7 lines
    in a reply (e.g. to EHLO)

Wed Jul 11 14:17:57 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.3.2.1
  - SSL/TLS servers may have crashed during client disconnection
  - lmtp: With lmtp_rcpt_check_quota=yes mail deliveries may have
    sometimes assert-crashed.
  - v2.3.2: "make check" may have crashed with 32bit systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 30 20:06:40 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.3.2
  * old-stats plugin: Don't temporarily enable PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    while opening /proc/self/io. This may still cause security
    problems if the process is ptrace()d at the same time.
    Instead, open it while still running as root.
  + doveadm: Added mailbox cache decision&remove commands. See
    doveadm-mailbox(1) man page for details.
  + doveadm: Added rebuild attachments command for rebuilding
    $HasAttachment or $HasNoAttachment flags for matching mails.
    See doveadm-rebuild(1) man page for details.
  + cassandra: Use fallback_consistency on more types of errors
  + lmtp proxy: Support outgoing SSL/TLS connections
  + lmtp: Add lmtp_rawlog_dir and lmtp_proxy_rawlog_dir settings.
  + submission: Add support for rawlog_dir
  + submission: Add submission_client_workarounds setting.
  + lua auth: Add password_verify() function and additional fields
    in auth request.
  - doveadm-server: TCP connections are hanging when there is a lot
    of network output. This especially caused hangs in
    dsync-replication.
  - Using multiple type=shared mdbox namespaces crashed
  - mail_fsync setting was ignored. It was always set to
    "optimized".
  - lua auth: Fix potential crash at deinit
  - SSL/TLS servers may have crashed if client disconnected during
    handshake.
  - SSL/TLS servers: Don't send extraneous certificates to client
    when alt certs are used.
  - lda, lmtp: Return-Path header without '<' may have
    assert-crashed.
  - lda, lmtp: Unencoded UTF-8 in email address headers may
    assert-crash
  - lda: -f parameter didn't allow empty/null/domainless address
  - lmtp, submission: Message size limit was hardcoded to 40 MB.
    Exceeding it caused the connection to get dropped during
    transfer.
  - lmtp: Fix potential crash when delivery fails at DATA stage
  - lmtp: login_greeting setting was ignored
  - Fix to work with OpenSSL v1.0.2f
  - systemd unit restrictions were too strict by default
  - Fix potential crashes when a lot of log output was produced
  - SMTP client may have assert-crashed when sending mail
  - IMAP COMPRESS: Send "end of compression" marker when
    disconnecting.
  - cassandra: Fix consistency=quorum to work
  - dsync: Lock file generation failed if home directory didn't
    exist
  - Snippet generation for HTML mails didn't ignore &entities
    inside blockquotes, producing strange looking snippets.
  - imapc: Fix assert-crash if getting disconnected and after
    reconnection all mails in the selected mailbox are gone.
  - pop3c: Handle unexpected server disconnections without
    assert-crash
  - fts: Fixes to indexing mails via virtual mailboxes.
  - fts: If mails contained NUL characters, the text around it
    wasn't indexed.
  - Obsolete dovecot.index.cache offsets were sometimes used.
    Trying to fetch a field that was just added to cache file may
    not have always found it.
- update pigeonhole to 0.5.2
  + Implement plugin for the a vendor-defined IMAP capability
    called "FILTER=SIEVE". It adds the ability to manually invoke
    Sieve filtering in IMAP. More information can be found in
    doc/plugins/imap_filter_sieve.txt.
  - The Sieve addess test caused an assertion panic for invalid
    addresses with UTF-8 codepoints in the localpart. Fixed by
    properly detecting invalid addresses with UTF-8 codepoints in
    the localpart and skipping these like other invalid addresses
    while iterating addresses for the address test.
  - Make the length of the subject header for the vacation response
    configurable and enforce the limit in UTF-8 codepoints rather
    than bytes. The subject header for a vacation response was
    statically truncated to 256 bytes, which is too limited for
    multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
  - Sieve editheader extension: Fix assertion panic occurring when
    it is used to manipulate a message header with a very large
    header field.
  - Properly abort execution of the sieve_discard script upon
    error.  Before, the LDA Sieve plugin attempted to execute the
    sieve_discard script when an error occurs. This can lead to the
    message being lost.
  - Fix the interaction between quota and the sieve_discard script.
    When quota was used together with a sieve_discard script, the
    message delivery did not bounce when the quota was exceeded.
- refreshed to apply cleanly again dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch

Wed Mar 28 09:02:33 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update pigeonhole to 0.5.1
  - Explicitly disallow UTF-8 in localpart in addresses parsed from
    Sieve script.
  - editheader extension: Corrected the stream position
    calculations performed while making the modified message
    available as a stream.  Pigeonhole Sieve crashed in LMTP with
    an assertion panic when the Sieve editheader extension was used
    before the message was redirected.  Experiments indicate that
    the problem occurred only with LMTP and that LDA is not
    affected.
  - fileinto extension: Fix assert panic occurring when fileinto is
    used without being listed in the require line, while the copy
    extension is listed there. This is a very old bug.
  - imapsieve plugin: Do not assert crash or log an error for
    messages that disappear concurrently while applying Sieve
    scripts. This event is now logged as a debug message.
  - Sieve extprograms plugin: Large output from "execute" command
    crashed delivery. Fixed buffering issue in code that handles
    output from the external program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 18:28:48 UTC 2018 - mrueckert@suse.de

  + imap_logout_format and pop3_logout_format settings now support
    all of the generic variables (e.g. %{rip}, %{session}, etc.)
  + Added auth_policy_check_before_auth,
    auth_policy_check_after_auth and auth_policy_report_after_auth
    settings.

- update to 2.3.0.1
  * CVE-2017-15130: TLS SNI config lookups may lead to excessive
    memory usage, causing imap-login/pop3-login VSZ limit to be
    reached and the process restarted. This happens only if Dovecot
    config has local_name { } or local { } configuration blocks and
    attacker uses randomly generated SNI servernames. (boo#1082828)
  * CVE-2017-14461: Parsing invalid email addresses may cause a
    crash or leak memory contents to attacker. For example, these
    memory contents might contain parts of an email from another
    user if the same imap process is reused for multiple users.
    First discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
    Independently also discovered by "flxflndy" via HackerOne.
    (boo#1082826)
  * CVE-2017-15132: Aborted SASL authentication leaks memory in
    login process. (boo#1075608)
  * Linux: Core dumping is no longer enabled by default via
    PR_SET_DUMPABLE, because this may allow attackers to bypass
    chroot/group restrictions. Found by cPanel Security Team.
    Nowadays core dumps can be safely enabled by using "sysctl -w
    fs.suid_dumpable=2". If the old behaviour is wanted, it can
    still be enabled by setting:
    import_environment=$import_environment PR_SET_DUMPABLE=1
  - imap-login with SSL/TLS connections may end up in infinite loop

- Replace %__-type macro indirections.
  Replace xargs rm by built in -delete of find(1).
- Run ldconfig directly via %post -p.
- Check for users in %pre before creating them, and do not suppress
  errors about it.

- backport 321a39be974deb2e7eff7b2a509a3ee6ff2e5ae1.patch
  fixes crash with imap sieve

- Move the example-config + mkcert.sh to /usr/share/dovecot
  This makes the files no longer documentation and they actually
  exist on e.g. our docker image, where rpms are installed without
  documentation. (boo#1070871)

- starting 2.3 package based on the latest 2.2 branch

  There are several new and exciting features in v2.3.0. I'm
  especially happy about the new logging and statistics code, which
  will allow us to generate statistics for just about everything.
  We didn't have time to implement everything we wanted for them
  yet, and there especially aren't all that many logging events yet
  that can be used for statistics. We'll implement those to v2.3.1,
  which might also mean that some of the APIs might still change in
  v2.3.1 if that's required.

  We also have new lib-smtp server code, which was used to
  implement SMTP submission server and do a partial rewrite for
  LMTP server.

  Some of the larger changes:

   * Various setting changes, see

     https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Upgrading/2.3

     If you upgrade from 2.2: Config file changes:
     - Removed:
       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/11-object-storage.conf
     - Added:
       /etc/dovecot/conf.d/20-submission.conf

   * Logging rewrite started: Logging is now based on hierarchical
     events.  This makes it possible to do various things, like: 1)
     giving consistent log prefixes, 2) enabling debug logging with
     finer granularity, 3) provide logs in more machine readable
     formats (e.g. json). Everything isn't finished yet, especially
     a lot of the old logging code still needs to be translated to
     the new way.
   * Statistics rewrite started: Stats are now based on (log)
     events.  It's possible to gather statistics about any event
     that is logged.  See http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Statistics for
     details
   * ssl_dh setting replaces the old generated ssl-parameters.dat
   * IMAP: When BINARY FETCH finds a broken mails, send [PARSE]
     error instead of [UNKNOWNCTE]
   * Linux: core dumping via PR_SET_DUMPABLE is no longer enabled
     by default due to potential security reasons (found by cPanel
     Security Team).

   + Added support for SMTP submission proxy server, which
     includes support for BURL and CHUNKING extension.
   + LMTP rewrite. Supports now CHUNKING extension and mixing of
     local/proxy recipients.
   + auth: Support libsodium to add support for ARGON2I and
     ARGON2ID password schemes.
   + auth: Support BLF-CRYPT password scheme in all platforms
   + auth: Added LUA scripting support for passdb/userdb.
     See https://wiki2.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/Lua
   - Input streams are more reliable now when there are errors or
     when the maximum buffer size is reached. Previously in some
     situations this could have caused Dovecot to try to read
     already freed memory.
   - Output streams weren't previously handling failures when
     writing a trailer at the end of the stream. This mainly
     affected encrypt and zlib compress ostreams, which  have
     silently written truncated files if the last write happened to
     fail (which shouldn't normally have ever happened).
   - virtual plugin: Fixed panic when fetching mails from virtual
     mailboxes with IMAP BINARY extension.
   - doveadm-server: Fix potential hangs with SSL connections
   - doveadm proxy: Reading commands' output from v2.2.33+ servers
     could have caused the output to be corrupted or caused a
     crash.
   - Many other smaller fixes
- patches:
  - dovecot-2.3.0-better_ssl_defaults.patch
  - dovecot-2.3.0-dont_use_etc_ssl_certs.patch
