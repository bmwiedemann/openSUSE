  <title>Tools to generate digital room correction filters</title>
  <description>DRC is a program used to generate correction filters for acoustic compensation
of HiFi and audio systems in general, including listening room compensation. DRC
generates just the FIR correction filters, which can be used with a real time or
offline convolver to provide real time or offline correction. DRC doesn't
provide convolution features, and provides only some simplified, although really
accurate, measuring tools.</description>
