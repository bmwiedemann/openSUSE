  <title>Small Wrapper Scripts for Processing DocBook Files</title>
  <description>The docbook-utils package is a set of a few small programs intended to
ease everyday use of technical documentation software based on the
DocBook DTD, either written in SGML or XML.

Tasks they currently accomplish are: * jw: convert SGML files to
   other formats (HTML, RTF, PostScript, PDF)

* sgmldiff: detect the differences in markup between two SGML files</description>
