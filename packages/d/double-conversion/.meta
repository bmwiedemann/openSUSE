  <description>Double-conversion provides binary-decimal and decimal-binary routines
for IEEE doubles. The library consists of efficient conversion routines
that have been extracted from the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been
re-factored and improved so that it can be used more easily in other projects.</description>
