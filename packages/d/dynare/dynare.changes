- Update to version 6.5:
  * Several issues in the nonlinear solver, used in e.g. numerical
    steady state computations, were fixed.
  * Optimization would, in rare cases, erroneously apply an
    infinite penalty function value
  * In rare cases, the multivariate diffuse Kalman filter/smoother
    (kalman_algo=3) did not correctly exit the diffuse stage
  * The following problems with the estimation command were fixed:
    - the point forecasts triggered by the forecast option did not
      take shock uncertainty into account
    - the keep_kalman_algo_if_singularity_is_detected option did
      not work as advertised (option will be removed in Dynare 7)
    - the EndTemperature suboption of the mode_compute=10 option
      (“simpsa”) was broken
    - the mh_posterior_mode_estimation option was broken in
      conjunction with the method_of_moments command
    - the nodecomposition option did not suppress all variance
      decompositions
    - the posterior_sampling_method='slice' option did not save
      all files in the correct folder
    - the mh_recover option did not work correctly in conjunction
      with the posterior_sampling_method='slice' and
      posterior_sampler_options=('save_tmp_file', 1) options
    - the results of mode-finding were not correctly stored in
      oo_.posterior_mode for shock and measurement error
      correlations
  * The following problems with non-linear filters were fixed:
    - the manual incorrectly stated that 1,000 instead of 5,000
      particles was the default
    - the estimation command did not allow the pruning option to
      be set for higher-order estimation
    - combining options filter_algorithm=cpf and
      proposal_approximation=montecarlo of the estimation command
      returned incorrect results
    - the suboptions 'unscented_beta' and 'unscented_kappa' of the
      particle_filter_options option of the estimation command did
      not accept values of 0
    - the filter_algorithm=gf and filter_algorithm=gmf options of
      the estimation command did not correctly handle correlated
      measurement error
  * The confidence bands of classical forecasts had incorrect
    coverage
  * Several issues with the forecast command used with exogenous
    deterministic variables (declared with the varexo_det command)
    were fixed:
    - without measurement errors, it would store the upper bound
      of the confidence interval in the HPDinf field and the lower
      bound in the HPDsup field
    - with multiple measurement errors it would crash if not all
      observables were requested as outputs
    - it would assign the output to the wrong variable names if a
      variable list was specified after the command
  * The discretionary_policy command did not accept the
    planner_discount_latex_name option, contrary to what the
    documentation says
  * The outfile option of the smoother2histval command would
    produce an incorrect file on models with two lags or more,
    leading to incorrect results when loading that file with the
    histval_file command
  * OccBin would occasionally crash upon encountering invalid
    parameter vectors
  * The example1_reporting.mod example file was broken
- Drop support for EOL Leap.
- Add dummy BuildRequires: libboost_thread-devel as a work-around
  for meson bug (gh#mesonbuild/meson#15470, boo#1257409).

- Update to version 6.4:
  * Several issues with the
    `perfect_foresight_with_expectation_errors` command:
    - when used with no `endval`/`endval(learnt_in=1)` block but
      an `endval(learnt_in=`t`)` block with t>1, convergence could
      fail if homotopy was needed
    - combined with `homotopy_marginal_linearization_fallback`, it
      would return incorrect results
    - it would crash with
      `homotopy_marginal_linearization_fallback` option if there
      were several distinct `shocks` or `endval` blocks with the
      `learnt_in` option
  * Using the `model_diagnostics` command with the `bytecode`
    option of the `model` block or the `model_options` command
    would crash if the static Jacobian was singular
  * The `discretionary_policy` command with the `noprint` option
    would crash when encountering a problem instead of continuing
  * Using the `ramsey_model` command with models declared as
    `linear` would crash during preprocessing when there is a
    lead/lag greater than 1 on endogenous variables or any
    lead/lag on exogenous variables
  * Using the `identification` command with the slice sampler
    would crash if the `slice_initialize_with_mode` option was
    used
  * The particle filter option `resampling_method` of the
    `estimation` command was broken
  * The `output=third` preprocessor option would not work if no
    computational commands were present in the `.mod` file
- Changes from version 6.3:
  * OccBin with option `smoother_inversion_filter` would crash the
    MCMC estimation if the `filtered_variables` or
    `filter_step_ahead` options were used
  * OccBin with option `smoother_inversion_filter` would use the
    PKF if `mh_replic>0`
  * OccBin with option `smoothed_state_uncertainty` would crash
    Dynare if the MCMC smoother was run after the classical one
  * OccBin's smoother would crash when encountering an internal
    error due to the output of the linear smoother not having been
    computed
  * Calling `model_info` with `differentiate_forward_vars` would
    crash The `identification` command would compute the
    asymptotic Hessian via simulation instead of via moments as
    intended
  * The `identification` command would crash during prior sampling
    if the initial draw did not solve the model
  * The `gsa_sample_file` was broken
  * Optimization algorithm `mode_compute=5` (`newrat`) would crash
    with `analytic_derivation`
  * The `discretionary_policy` command would crash if the model
    was purely forward-looking
  * The `dsample` command would crash
  * The `conditional_forecast_paths` block did not accept vector
    inputs
  * For MCMC chains with fewer than 6000 draws, the default number
    of `sub_draws` used to compute posterior moments was incorrect
  * Bi-annual dates (e.g. `2024S1` or `2024H1`) were not accepted
    within Dynare statements
  * Plotting `dseries` did not correctly show dates on the x-axis
- Drop dynare-sphinx-str-concat.patch: incorporated upstream.
- Minor re-base of dynare-libdir.patch for updated version.

      with varexo_det and pruning would return forecasts without
      pruning instead of providing an error message

    moments_varendo, or smoother options of the estimation command
    had been specified
  * The bvar_irf command would ignore the SquareRoot option and
    instead employ a Cholesky decomposition
  * The univariate Kalman filter erroneously treated observations
    with negative prediction variances due to numerical issues as
    missing values instead of discarding the parameter draw
  * A new homotopy_exclude_varexo option to the
    perfect_foresight_solver command has been added, to exclude
    some exogenous variables from the homotopy procedure (i.e. to
    keep them at their value corresponding to 100% of the shock
    during all homotopy iterations).

Wed Nov 22 11:54:45 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.5:
  * In a stochastic context, results could be incorrect if an
    endogenous with a lead ⩾ 2 or an exogenous with a lead ⩾ 1
    appeared in the argument(s) of a call to a (nonlinear)
    external function
  * With the use_dll option of the model block, the expression
    sign(x) would evaluate to ±1 instead of 0 if x=0
  * If the guess value given to the steady command was such that
    the residuals were all below tolerance, except some that are
    NaN, then this guess value was incorrectly accepted as the
    solution to the steady state problem
  * The method_of_moments command with GMM was ignoring the
    analytic_standard_errors option when using mode_compute=4
  * Homotopy with the extended_path command at order=0 was broken

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 12 04:31:04 UTC 2023 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.4:
  * Estimation:
    - The load_results_after_load_mh option would not find the
      location of the results file
    - The computation of prior/posterior statistics would crash if
      the value of the filter step_ahead option was greater than 1
      without requesting a forecast or the smoother
    - NaN or complex parameters returned by steady state files
      were not correctly handled
    - analytical_derivation could be triggered with
      endogenous_prior but would not take the endogenous prior
      into account for the Jacobian and Hessian
  * OccBin:
    - Running the calib_smoother command with
      smoother_inversion_filter would crash unless
      likelihood_inversion_filter was also specified

      error was encountered during computation of the decision
      rules
  * PAC equation estimation through iterative OLS would crash if
    the auxiliary model contained a constant.
  * The variable label was incorrect for leads and lags of
    exogenous variables in the display of decision rules and in
    the model_info command.
  * Declaring a trend_var variable while not having a
    var(deflator=...) statement would cause the preprocessor to
    crash.
  * Macro processor: error messages following a @#define,
    @#include or @#includepath directive could in some cases point
    to a line number off by 1.
  * Perfect foresight simulations: the debug option would not
    preserve sparsity, causing out of memory errors.
