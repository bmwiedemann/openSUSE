- Update to version 5.4:
  * Estimation:
    - The load_results_after_load_mh option would not find the
      location of the results file
    - The computation of prior/posterior statistics would crash if
      the value of the filter step_ahead option was greater than 1
      without requesting a forecast or the smoother
    - NaN or complex parameters returned by steady state files
      were not correctly handled
    - analytical_derivation could be triggered with
      endogenous_prior but would not take the endogenous prior
      into account for the Jacobian and Hessian
  * OccBin:
    - Running the calib_smoother command with
      smoother_inversion_filter would crash unless
      likelihood_inversion_filter was also specified
    - Running the piecewise Kalman smoother would crash if an
      error was encountered during computation of the decision
      rules
  * PAC equation estimation through iterative OLS would crash if
    the auxiliary model contained a constant.
  * The variable label was incorrect for leads and lags of
    exogenous variables in the display of decision rules and in
    the model_info command.
  * Declaring a trend_var variable while not having a
    var(deflator=...) statement would cause the preprocessor to
    crash.
  * Macro processor: error messages following a @#define,
    @#include or @#includepath directive could in some cases point
    to a line number off by 1.
  * Perfect foresight simulations: the debug option would not
    preserve sparsity, causing out of memory errors.
- Make doc packages noarch.
