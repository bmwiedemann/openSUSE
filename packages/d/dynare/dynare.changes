- Update to version 5.5:
  * In a stochastic context, results could be incorrect if an
    endogenous with a lead ⩾ 2 or an exogenous with a lead ⩾ 1
    appeared in the argument(s) of a call to a (nonlinear)
    external function
  * With the use_dll option of the model block, the expression
    sign(x) would evaluate to ±1 instead of 0 if x=0
  * If the guess value given to the steady command was such that
    the residuals were all below tolerance, except some that are
    NaN, then this guess value was incorrectly accepted as the
    solution to the steady state problem
  * The method_of_moments command with GMM was ignoring the
    analytic_standard_errors option when using mode_compute=4
  * Homotopy with the extended_path command at order=0 was broken
  * The parallel_use_psexec command-line option was ignored
  * With the bytecode option of the model block, using the
    operators abs(), cbrt() and sign() would lead to a crash
  * The fast command-line option was broken under MATLAB with
    Windows
  * Ramsey steady state computation could fail if an expectation
    or diff operator was present in the model
  * A crash could occur if some external function call was present
    in an auxiliary variable
  * The endogenous_prior option of the estimation command could
    erroneously display a warning message about missing
    observations
  * The model_comparison command would crash if the .mod file name
    had less than four characters
  * The shock_decomposition command would overwrite previously
    stored smoother results
  * The x13 interface in dseries did not handle missing values,
    particularly at the beginning of a series
  * The x13 interface in dseries would occasionally crash under
    Windows with segmentation violations
  * OccBin: estimation would crash if a previous shocks(surprise)
    simulation was conducted
  * The internals command would not find the location of the
    _results.mat file
  * The prior optimize command would not work with mode_compute=5
- Minor improvement to conditionals specifying the right version
  of gcc to use.
- Drop dynare-add-missing-include.patch: upstreamed.

- Update to version 5.4:
  * Estimation:
    - The load_results_after_load_mh option would not find the
      location of the results file
    - The computation of prior/posterior statistics would crash if
      the value of the filter step_ahead option was greater than 1
      without requesting a forecast or the smoother
    - NaN or complex parameters returned by steady state files
      were not correctly handled
    - analytical_derivation could be triggered with
      endogenous_prior but would not take the endogenous prior
      into account for the Jacobian and Hessian
  * OccBin:
    - Running the calib_smoother command with
      smoother_inversion_filter would crash unless
      likelihood_inversion_filter was also specified
    - Running the piecewise Kalman smoother would crash if an
      error was encountered during computation of the decision
      rules
  * PAC equation estimation through iterative OLS would crash if
    the auxiliary model contained a constant.
  * The variable label was incorrect for leads and lags of
    exogenous variables in the display of decision rules and in
    the model_info command.
  * Declaring a trend_var variable while not having a
    var(deflator=...) statement would cause the preprocessor to
    crash.
  * Macro processor: error messages following a @#define,
    @#include or @#includepath directive could in some cases point
    to a line number off by 1.
  * Perfect foresight simulations: the debug option would not
    preserve sparsity, causing out of memory errors.
