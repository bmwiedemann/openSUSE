  <title>Modern XMPP Client using GTK+/Vala</title>
  <description>Dino is an instant messaging client for the Jabber/XMPP network,
providing a unique and modern user experience based on the latest
technology from the GNOME project. Dino is still in early
development and has limited features, but already has basic support
for XMPP's latest encryption features. Future versions will provide
a plug-in API, so that developers can easily add new optional
features.
