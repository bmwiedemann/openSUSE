%description
dvbstream can broadcast either a (subset of a) DVB transport stream or
a DVB program stream over a LAN using the rtp protocol. It attempts to
be compliant with RFCs 1889, 1890, 2038, and 2250. It can also dump the
stream to stdout, for example, for local software decoding when using
DVB cards without a hardware MPEG decoder.
