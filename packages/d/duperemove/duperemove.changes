Mon Jul 17 05:45:51 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.12:
  * Duplication lookup is now based on extents. This leads to a
    massive increase of the performances. Block-based lookup is
    still possible via --dedupe-options=partial.
  * Following that change, a new hashfile format has been introduced.
    Previous hashfile format is still supported when extents lookup
    are disabled, this is not recommended.
  * Batching has been implemented. When enabled with the -B <batchsize>
    option, duperemove will run the deduplication phase every <batchsize>
    scanned files. This is meant to help running duperemove on large
    dataset, with small blocksize, or on memory-constrained systems.
  * All hash algorithm has been removed and replaced by xxh128. This
    variant is as robust as murmur3 while being faster. Choosing a
    hash function via the --hash option has been removed. Hashfiles
    built with other algorithm must be removed.

Thu Feb  3 16:48:27 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.11.3:
  * Increase open file limit. (#269)
  * Create hash database file with 600 permission for improved
    security. (#262)
  * Read more data per pread, for v2 hashfile format this reduces
    the overall number of syscalls made which in turns results
    in better performance.
  * Fix truncated file handling, eliminating a an infinite
    loop case. (#255)
