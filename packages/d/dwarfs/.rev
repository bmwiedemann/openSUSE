    <comment>- Update to version 0.12.1: 
Features
  * Added --memory-limit=auto to mkdwarfs to use a more reasonable
    (hopefully) default for the block queue. The old default of
    1 GiB was quite arbitrary and definitely not suitable for
    low-end systems. The new auto default will determine the limit
    based on the number of workers (which in turn is based on the
    number of CPUs), the block size, and the amount of physical
    memory of the system.
  * Replaced vector_byte_buffer with malloc_byte_buffer, which is
    internally based around a simple buffer that doesn't incur the
    cost of initializing each element like std::vector. Especially
    for large blocks which are known to be overwritten immediately,
    this can save a few CPU cycles.
- Changes in version 0.12.0:
  * New Licensing Conditions: Instead of being all GPL-3.0 like all
    the previous releases, this release changes the license of a
    large fraction of the DwarFS code to MIT. All tools and
    libraries that only read DwarFS images are now MIT-licensed.
    Everything else (e.g. mkdwarfs) is still GPL-3.0 for the time
    being.
Bugfixes
  * Changes for compatibility with Boost.Process v2.
Features
  * Re-licensed all libraries required for reading DwarFS images
    under the MIT license. The source of all tools that just read
    DwarFS images (i.e. everything except for mkdwarfs) are also
    under the MIT license now. Everything else is still GPL-3.0.

  * New hotness categorizer in mkdwarfs that allows a list of &quot;hot&quot;</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.12.3:
Bugfixes
  * Automatic image offset detection (for images using a custom
    header) did not work correctly if the header contained a
    string that would be identified as the start of a v1 section
    header (these were only used before dwarfs-0.3.0).
    If there was either &quot;DWARFS\x02\x00&quot; or &quot;DWARFS\x02\x01&quot; in
    the header, offset detection would fail. The check has been
    modified to peek further into the data and ensure this really
    is a v1 section header, and also checking if the next section
    header position can be derived from the length field.
    It is still possible to construct a file system image where
    offset detection will ultimately fail, but it is much less
    likely with the change.
- Changes in version 0.12.2:
Bugfixes
  *The dwarfs-0.12.0 release introduced a performance regression
   where FLAC compression took more than twice as long as in the
   previous releases. This has been fixed. FLAC decompression was
   unaffected.</comment>

    <comment>- Replace wrong BuildRequires pkgconfig(clzma) -&gt; pkgconfig(liblzma);
  build only succeeded previously by accident.

- Update to version 0.12.4:
Bugfixes
  * Segfault on bad_compression_ratio_error. When recompressing a
    filesystem where some blocks cannot be compressed using the
    selected algorithm because of a bad_compression_ratio_error,
    the resulting block was left empty.
  * Add history unless --no-history is given when rewriting a file
    system image.
  * Allow dumping frozen_layout w/o frozen_analysis in dwarfsck.
  * Logging timestamps should show local time.
Features
  * More complete breakdown of metadata in dwarfsck.
  * Add schema_raw_dump flag to dwarfsck --detail.
Build
  * Update folly/fbthrift/fsst.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 0.13.0:
Bugfixes:
  * Made section index discovery more robust.
    gh#mhx/dwarfs#264
  * A recent kernel change (https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/5/5/2868)
    caused the tools_test to fail on Linux 6.14 and later.
    This has been fixed by accepting both EPERM and ENOSYS as
    valid error codes for link() calls.
Features:
  * Support for big-endian architectures.
    This is still experimental, even though all unit tests pass
    with QEMU, and the benchmark suite runs fine on real hardware.
    This currently requires forked versions of folly and fsst.
    The changes are small and the pull requests will hopefully be
    merged upstream soon.
  * Experimental support for 32-bit architectures.
    While DwarFS should mostly &quot;just work&quot; on 32-bit when using
    small images (a few hundred megabytes), the limited address
    space is a problem for the extensive use of memory-mapped
    files inside DwarFS. There will be changes to limit the use of
    mmap in the future (mainly due to other issues), which should
    help 32-bit compatibility as a side-effect.
    gh#mhx/dwarfs#268.
  * The category metadata for categorized blocks is now stored in
    the metadata block by default. This allows re-compressing the
    blocks with a metadata-dependent algorithm (e.g. FLAC) even if
    they were previously compressed using a metadata-independent
    algorithm.
    This can be disabled using the --no-category-metadata option.
    See the mkdwarfs man page for more details.</comment>
