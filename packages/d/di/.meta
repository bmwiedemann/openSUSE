  <title>Disk Information Utility</title>
  <description>di is a disk information utility that displays everything that df does and
more. It features the ability to display your disk usage in whatever format you
prefer. It also checks the user and group quotas, so that the user sees the
space available for their use, not the system wide disk space. It is designed
to be highly portable across many platforms and is great for heterogenous
networks.
