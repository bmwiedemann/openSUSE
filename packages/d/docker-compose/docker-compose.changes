  as otherwise 'zypper in docker-compose' will not provide a docker-compose binary

- first version of package docker-compose (v2)
  - v2 was rewritten in golang, while v1 was in Python
  - as they behaviour changes between v1 (python-docker-compose) and v2,
    this package does not obsolete the v1 package
