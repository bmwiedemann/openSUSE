# As this package is written in golang, it does not provide
# python*-docker-compose. But as it obsoletes the v1 package
# written in python, we get a warning.
# In addition docker-compose > 2.0.0 is provided by the 
# docker-compose package, that this package requires. So it
# cannot provide what it obsoletes.
#
# The warning can therefore be ignored.
