  <description>
Draco is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes
and point clouds. It is intended to improve the storage and transmission of
3D graphics.

Draco was designed and built for compression efficiency and speed. The code
supports compressing points, connectivity information, texture coordinates,
color information, normals, and any other generic attributes associated
with geometry. With Draco, applications using 3D graphics can be
significantly smaller without compromising visual fidelity. For users, this
means apps can now be downloaded faster, 3D graphics in the browser can
load quicker, and VR and AR scenes can now be transmitted with a fraction
of the bandwidth and rendered quickly.

Draco is released as C++ source code that can be used to compress 3D
graphics as well as C++ and Javascript decoders for the encoded data.
