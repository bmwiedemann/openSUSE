  <title>Tool that converts source archives into Debian package source</title>
  <description>This package allows you to take a standard (or upstream) source package
and convert it into a format that will allow you to build Debian packages.

After answering a few questions, dh_make will then provide a set of
templates that, after some small editing, will allow you to create a
Debian package.
