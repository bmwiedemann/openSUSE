  <title>Minimize files to interesting parts</title>
  <description>Delta assists you in minimizing &quot;interesting&quot; files subject to a test
of their interestingness. A common such situation is when attempting to
isolate a small failure-inducing substring of a large input that causes
your program to exhibit a bug. Please see
/usr/share/doc/packages/delta/www/using_delta.html for documentation.</description>
