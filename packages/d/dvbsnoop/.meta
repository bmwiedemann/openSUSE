  <title>DVB / MPEG stream analyzer program</title>
  <description>Its purpose is to debug, dump or view digital stream information (e.g. digital
television broadcasts) send via satellite, cable or terrestrial. Streams can be
SI, PES or TS. Basically you can describe dvbsnoop as a &quot;swiss army knife&quot;
analyzing program for DVB, MHP, DSM-CC or MPEG - similar to TCP network sniffer
programs like the old and famous snoop on Sun Solaris or tcpdump on Linux
(which is in fact a kind of a clone of SunOS 'snoop'). You may also analyze
offline mpeg streams, e.g. stored on DVD or mpeg2 movie files.</description>
