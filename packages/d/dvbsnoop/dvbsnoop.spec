%description
Its purpose is to debug, dump or view digital stream information (e.g.
digital television broadcasts) send via satellite, cable or terrestrial.
Streams can be SI, PES or TS. Basically you can describe dvbsnoop as a
"swiss army knife" analyzing program for DVB, MHP, DSM-CC or MPEG - similar
to TCP network sniffer programs like the old and famous snoop on Sun
Solaris or tcpdump on Linux (which is in fact a kind of a clone of SunOS
'snoop'). You may also analyze offline mpeg streams, e.g. stored on DVD or
mpeg2 movie files.
