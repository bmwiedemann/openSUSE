  <title>AV1 decoder</title>
  <description>AV1 is a video codec by the Alliance for Open Media, composed of most
of the important Web companies (Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon,
Microsoft, Mozilla...).

AV1 has the potential to be up to 20% better than the HEVC codec, but
the patents license is totally free, while HEVC patents licenses are
insanely high and very confusing.

dav1d supports:
 * all the features of AV1, even the less know ones
 * 8, 10, 12 bits, and all chroma subsamplings
 * all AV1 files that were shared to the developers
