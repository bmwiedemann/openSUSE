%description
The game takes place in a science fiction setting of the Solar System
where the player is a mercenary and must stop robots infected by an
alien virus.

The player controls a flying ship in zero gravity with a six degrees
of freedom movement scheme. The game features both indoor and outdoor
environments, made possible with the use of a hybrid engine that
combines the capabilities of a portal rendering engine with those of
a flight simulator-like terrain engine.

There is a single-player campaign mode and an an online multiplayer
mode where numerous players can compete against each other in
different game types.
