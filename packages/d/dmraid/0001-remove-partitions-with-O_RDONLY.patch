Subject: [PATCH] remove partitions with O_RDONLY

It's not necessary to use O_RDWR to use BLKPG_DEL_PARTITION.
It's actually harmful, because closing the device will cause
an IN_CLOSE_WRITE inotify event, which will trigger a BLKRRPART
from systemd, which will reinstate all partitions just deleted.
