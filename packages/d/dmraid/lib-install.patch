Fix two issues with installing shared libraries.

1/  the [[ =~ ]] operator only treats the RHS as a regular expression
   if it isn't quoted.  So we need to remove the quotes.

2/ The libdmraid-event-* library is not a shared library in the regular
   sense.  i.e. programs are not linked against it and so do not have the
   library version number encoded in them.
   Rather, this is a shared-object that is explicitly loaded by dmeventd
   on request from dmraid.  dmraid asks for "libdmraid-event-ism.so", so
   that is the only name that the shared object should be stored under.
   Providing a name with a trailing version number just makes it look like
   something that it is not.
