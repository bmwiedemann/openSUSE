  <title>A Device-Mapper Software RAID Support Tool</title>
  <description>This software discovers, activates, deactivates, and displays
properties of software RAID sets, such as ATARAID, and contained DOS
partitions.

devices with respective mappings for the ATARAID sets discovered.

The following ATARAID types are supported:

- Highpoint HPT37X

- Highpoint HPT45X

- Intel Software RAID
