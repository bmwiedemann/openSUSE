Tue Dec  8 09:23:06 UTC 2020 - nick wang <nwang@suse.com>

- Update to 9.0.26
 * fix a case of a disk unexpectedly becoming Outdated by moving the
   exchange of the initial packets into the body of the two-phase-commit
   that happens at a connect
 * fix adding of new volumes to resources with a primary node
 * reliably detect split brain situation on both nodes
 * fix an unexpected occurrence of NetworkFailure state in a tight
   drbdsetup disconnect; drbdsetup connect sequence
 * fix online verify to return to Established from VerifyS if the VerifyT node
   was temporarily Inconsistent during the run
 * fix a corner case where a node ends up Outdated after the crash and rejoin
   of a primary node
 * implement 'blockdev --setro' in DRBD
 * following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.9 and ensure
   compatibility with Linux 5.8 and 5.9
 * fix a crash if during resync a discard operation fails on the
   resync-target node
 * fix online verify to not clamp disk states to UpToDate
 * fix promoting resync-target nodes; the problem was that it could modify
   the bitmap of an ongoing resync; which leads to alarming log messages
 * pause a resync if the sync-source node becomes inconsistent; an example
   is a cascading resync where the upstream resync aborts and leaves the
   sync-source node for the downstream resync with an inconsistent disk;
   note, the node at the end of the chain could still have an outdated disk
   (better than inconsistent)
 * allow force primary on a sync-target node by breaking the resync
 * minor fixes to the compat tests
 * fix for writes not getting mirrored over a connection while the primary
   transitions through the WFBitMapS state
 * completed missing logic of the new two-phase-commit based connect process;
   avoid connecting partitions with a primary in each; ensure consistent
   decisions if the connect attempt will be retried

- bsc#1175257, update to 9.0.25-0rc1
 * fix a race condition between receiving UUIDs and finishing a resync
   that can lead to a false-positive split-brain detection later on
 * fix access after free of peer_req objects, that only happened when
   a resync target node is paused sync source at the same time
 * fix abortion of local state changes in case they can not proceed due
   to loss of connection
 * fix corner cases with reconciliation resync and parallel promote
 * fix an issue establishing a connection when the multipath feature is
   used to connect to a stacked resource without a dedicated service IP
 * fix sometimes a peer-disk state to another resync-target staying Outdated
   after two resyncs from the same sync source node finish
 * fix an (unlikely) deadlock while establishing a connection
 * deactivate the kref_debug code, it has performance implicatios
 * Introduce the "disconnected" hander; it receives the last connection
   state in the evnironment variable DRBD_CSTATE
- Changes of drbd-9.0.24-1
 * fix deadlock when connecting drbd-9 to drbd-8.4 and the drbd-9
   side becomes sync-source
 * fix an issue with 3 (or more) node configurations; with a diskless node
   and two storage nodes; if one of the storage nodes was hard rebooted
   and came back and the diskless got primary and did not issue write
   requests and the returning storage node established a connection with
   the surviving storage node first, DRBD failed to upgrade the disk
   state to UpToDate after the resync
 * detect split-brain situations also when both nodes are primary;
   this is how it was in drbd-8.4; up to now drbd-9 did not realize
   the split-brain since it complains about the not allowed dual
   primary first; for this change a new protocol version was necessary
 * verified it compiles with Linux 5.7

Wed Jun 10 03:33:22 UTC 2020 - nick wang <nwang@suse.com>

- bsc#1172761, Update to drbd-9.0.23-1
 * fix a deadlock (regression introduced in 9.0.22) that can happen when
   new current UUID is generated while a connection gets established
 * Do not create a new data generation if the node has
   'allow-remote-read = no' set, is primary, and the local disk fails
   (because it has no access to good data anyome)
 * fix a deadlock (regression introduced in 9.0.22) that can be
   triggered if a minor is added into a resource with an established
   connection
 * generate new UUID immediately if a primary loses a disk due to an IO
   error
 * fix read requests on diskless nodes that hit a read error on a
   diskful node; the retry on another diskful node works, but a bug
   could lead to a log-storm on the diskless node
 * fix removal of diskless nodes from clusters with quorum enabled
   (initiated from the diskless itself)
 * fix wrongly declined state changes if connections are established
   concurrently
 * fix continuation of initial resync; before that the initial resync
   always started from the beginning if it was interrupted
 * use rwsem _non_owner() operations to avoid false positives of
   lock-dep when running on a debug kernel
 * fix a sometimes missed resync if only a diskless node was primary
   since the day0 UUID
 * fix a corner case where a SyncSource node does not recognise
   that a SyncTarget node declared the resync as finished
 * update compat up to Linux 5.6

 * introduce locking to avoid connection retries when UUIDs or
   relevant flags change during the exchange of this data
 * improve serialization of events after loosing a primary
 * fix a constraint in sanitize state that can caused a promote to be
   deliced by some other node
 * fix a case of a false positive detection of a split brain condition
 * allow a resync target to switch to the resync source with less
   bits out of sync
 * fix bitmap UUID after resync to use current UUID from self rather
   than sync source
 * fix pushing bitmap UUID into history when changed
 * fix regression introduced with 9.0.20, that can cause a missed
   resync after a reconciliation resync
 * fix regression introduced with 9.0.20, that can cause a missed
   resync after a promote on a diskless node
 * fix UUID handling in case a node promotes during (a short)
   reconciliation resync
 * fix removing of a diskless node when quorum is enabled

Tue Feb 25 07:03:39 UTC 2020 - nick wang <nwang@suse.com>

- Update to drbd-9.0.21-1, require coccinelle >= 1.0.8
 * fix compat for write same on linux 4.9 and the Debian users
 * fix kernel compat for linux 4.8 and 4.9; this mainly affected Debian
   users; The symptoms where slow resync and resync getting stuck always at
   the same point
 * enable resync of lost and re-created backing devices (think lost node) when
   the backing device was thinly provisioned and its current uuid is pre-set
   to a 'day0 UUID' (by LINSTOR); that works by copying a unused bitmap slot
   which tracks all changes since day 0
 * fix attach when bitmap is on PMEM; before it was set to
   'all blocks out-of-sync' upon attach
 * avoid doing reconciliation resync multiple times by updating the
   resync target's dagtag after if completed successfully
 * return disk-state from Outdated to UpToDate when it loses connection
   while in WFBitMapT and we have a stable and UpToDate peer
 * new option --force-resync flag can be passed to new-current-uuid, that
   can be used to trigger initial resync without touching the role

Fri Oct 11 02:32:09 UTC 2019 - nick wang <nwang@suse.com>

- Update to drbd-9.0.20-1
 * fix a case of false split brain detection if a diskless node promotes
   multiple times, by aligning the rules for generating a new current-UUID
   on a diskless nodes with them on a node with disk
 * check if we still have quorum by exchanging a drbd-ping with peers
   before creating new current UUID after loosing one peer
 * fix after weak handling to not interfere with reconciliation resyncs
 * retry connect when one of the relevant flags changes during UUID exchange
 * fix reconciliation resync if one of the secondary got an current-UUID update
 * fix resync to make progress after it was paused by an other resync operation
 * fix false split-brains when a resync source changes current-UUID during
   resync operation
 * fix restore of D_OUTDATED when the resource first only attached and
   then the peer objects are created (in contrast to the usual, new-peer,
   attach, connect)
 * abort creating new current-UUID when writing to meta-data fails in
   the moment where the new-current-UUID should be written
 * removed DRBD marking itself as read-only when secondary; this flag
   was exposed using the BLKROGET ioctl; that should be left to user-land
   use; recent KVM checks that flag, and does not dare auto-promote when
   set by DRBD
 * fix a small memory-leak when creating peer devices
 * fix a possible information leak of kernel memory that pads net-link packets
 * completing implications of "allow-remote-read=no"; i.e.  when not to
   create a new-current-UUID as read-write access to the data set was lost;
   also fail both reads and writes if reads are no longer possible
 * new option value "rr-conflict=retry-connect"; that helps in scenarios with
   quorum where stopping a service takes longer than a temporarily network
   outage and DRBD's reconnect
 * code cleanups, introduced enums for remaining magic numbers
 * new kernel-backward-compatibility framework based on spatch/coccinelle,
   replacing an unmaintainable moloch of C preprocessor hell; Merged the
   complete kernel-compat submodule
 * ships with pre-computed compat-patches for main distros' kernels; in case
   an other kernel is found it tries to use local spatch, if that is not
   installed the build process tries to use a LINBIT hosted web service
   to create the compat patch ("spatch-as-a-service").
 * compat with up to Linux-5.3-rc2

 * disable quorum tie-breaker for 0 voters
 * fix dax_direct_access() error return check
 * fix resync stuck at near completion; bug was intorduces with 9.0.17
 * unblock IO when on-quorum-lost policy is changed (suspend -> io-error)
 * introduce allow-remote-read configuration option; set it to "no" for
   DR links you only want to write, but never read
 * only complain about UUID changes during initial handshake

 * Fix potential spinlock deadlock in IRQ
 * Minor fixes: forget-peer, _rcu iterators
 * Quickly stop resync during AHEAD/BEHIND by introducing new
   packet for that purpose.
 * The quorum feature can now use the connectivity to
   the majority of Diskless nodes as tiebreaker
 * Access meta-data using DAX if it is on persistent memory

 * Fix resync-after dependencies; cross-resource dependencies
   and missing resources

   other connection; pause first resync; fix wrong display of negative
   resync progress percentage in this case
 * Fix volume numbers between 32767 and 65534
 * Fix the data integrity implementation; it was broken since drbd-9.0
   and reported only false positives
 * Fix for a corner-case when a promote action happens concurrently with
   a reconciliation resync
 * Improve resync code to be able to fully utilize fast storage
   backend devices and fast networks with resync traffic; as a side
   effect the settling time of the resync controller got shorter in
   for most cases
 * Show in the user-visible message who the opener is if if demote/down
   fails doe to someone holding a drbd device open
 * docker file for a "load drbd module container" and allow to disable

* fix spurious temporary promotion failure: if after Primary
  loss failover happened too quickly, transparently retry internally.

  negotiating the bio_size
- Fixed a rare race condition where an empty resync could stall with if
  pause/unpause events happen in parallel

Fri Dec 16 03:45:16 UTC 2011 - tserong@suse.com

- update to 8.3.11
 * Added missing spinlock in compressed bitmap receive (regression introduced
   in 8.3.10, could lead to "negative" out-of-sync stats and non-terminating
   resync when "use-rle" is enabled)
 * Fixed handling of read errors during online verify runs
 * Fixes for possible distributed deadlocks during online verify and
   checksum based resync processes

   disk state goes to inconsistent
 * Fixed the behavior in case ping-timeout and ping-int are set to the
   same value
 * Fix for connecting on high latency network links
 * Fixed wrong connection drops ("PingAck did not arrive in time") with

   established again
 * Fixes to drbdmeta and drbdsetup for the > 16TByte support
 * Made negotiation of max_bio_size conservative instead of optimistic

    concurrent connection loss.
  * Fixed spurious full syncs that happened when connection got lost while
    one node was in WFSyncUUID state (Bugz 318)

    io-error, and suspend-io. The default is "io-error", which matches the
    previous behavior.
  * If the fencing policy is set to resource-and-stonith, the primary node
    will creates the new current UUID _after_ the fencing handler
    returned. (Before it did immediately)

    are out of sync. That can be activated by using "invalidate-remote" on an
    unconnected primary.

- remove KMP subpackage, the kernel modules are part of the kernel
  and don't build out of tree anymore

- update to 8.3.7:
 * Lots of fixes to the new RPM packaging
 * Lots of fixes to the autoconfig stuff
 * Following the rename of CONFIG_LBD to CONFIG_LBDAF
 * Silenced an assert. Could trigger after changing write ordering (Bugz 261)
 * Fixed a race condition between detach and ongoing IO. Very hard to
   trigger, caused an OOPS in make_request/drbd_make_request. (Bugz 262)
 * Fixed a regression in the resync handshake code introduced before 8.3.3.
   That bug causes DRBD to block during the initial handshake when a partial
   resync is not possible but a full resync is necessary. Happens very rarely.
   (Bugz 260)
 * Do not drop into StandAlone mode when connection is lost during authentication
 * Corrected a null test in the authentication code, found by conccinelle,
   thanks to upstream integration. The chance to trigger that was probably 10^-9.
 * crm-fence-peer.sh is now also usable if DRBD is managed from the xen block
   helper script
 * Fixes to the init script's dependencies
 * Backported cleanups that where contributed to the in kernel DRBD
 * Allow online resizing of disconnected devices, new option to drbdsetup
   drbdsetup /dev/drbdX resize --assume-peer-has-space
 * Allow multiple after options in the syncer section for stacked setups
 * Correctly process relative paths in include statements in drbd.conf
 * New option (-t) for drbdadm to test syntax of config snippets
 * Following Linux upstream changes 2.6.32 (SHASH and in_flight issues)
 * New /etc/drbd.conf example that suggests the use of /etc/drbd.d/xxx.res
 * Fixed a regression introduced shortly before 8.3.3, which might
   case a deadlock in DRBD's disconnect code path. (Bugz 258)
 * Fixed drbdsetup X resume-io which is needed for the recovery
   from the effects of broken fence-peer scripts. (Bugz 256)
 * Do not reduce master score of a current Primary on connection loss,
   to avoid unnecessary migrations
 * Do not display the usage count dialog for /etc/inti.d/drbd status

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 14 21:44:10 CEST 2006 - lmb@suse.de

- Update to 0.7.21.
  * Fixed the "syncer stalled" after reconnect symptom.
  * Fixed the "stalled in WFParams" after reconnect symptom. The cause
    of this bug was actually a misuse of the data socket.
  * Allow to set the uplug_watermark to 1, only usefull for very strange
    cases.
  * The GC comparison code failed to start a resync in case the two
    cluster node failed simultaniously (common power failure).
  * Fixed DRBD's code to start kernel threads to work on 2.6.17 also.
  * IOCTL return codes fixed for 32bit userland - 64 bit kernel
    setups.
  * New config option "unplug-watermark".
  * Released the drbd_alloc_ee() / drbd_free_ee() implementation from
    the DRBD+ branch to the main branch.
  * Fixed a bug where lc_del() left a list poison in an LRU chache's
    hash table. The only way to trigger this bug was:
    up (>>200M), primary, mkfs, resize to 200M, down, up
  * DRBD now propagates the backing storage's read ahead properties
    to upper layers. With devices that read very fast, this is
    important.
  * GFP_KERNEL was changed to GFP_NOIO in a few places, to make it
    more save against deadlocks in the memory subsystem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 17:10:38 CEST 2006 - lmb@suse.de

- Import fixes from 0.7.18:
- Under high memory pressure it was possible to hit a deadlock on a
  kmalloc(). Changed the GFP mask, it is no longer possible to deadlock
  it with memory pressure.
- With very unlucky network timing during connect DRBD falls into a
  connect / drop-connection loop, that as soon as DRBD is in this loop
  is very stable. This is fixed now, DRBD detects this situation an
  breaks out of it.
- Fix to the init-script. Now it waits until udev has created the device
  nodes of _all_ resources.
- A small fix for the 32bit userland 64bit kernel people, running older
  kernels.
- Improved handling of IO errors during initial read in of the activity
  log.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Import upstream fixes from 0.7.17:
 - There was a bug that could cause the activity log to be not applied
   after a primary crash, when an other size than 127 elements was
   configured.
 - There was a bug in the activity log code, that could cause that the
   latest update to the AL is omitted at recovery time.
 - The "Marked additional XXKB as out-of-synced based on AL." message
   showed one one eighth of the real amount.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 16 16:41:19 CET 2006 - lmb@suse.de

- Update to 0.7.16, new fixes:
 - DRBD no longer shrinks an consistent device if it gets connected to
   an smaller peer or attached to a smaller disk.

  - Proper handling of backing storage devices that occasionally fail
    READA (=read ahead) requests. (E.g. LVM and MD) DRBD now fails READA
    requests itself, if a resynchronisation is running and it would need
    to fetch the block from its peer. 
  - "drbdadm adjust" had a race, which caused random errors. ( Missing
    waitpid() ). Fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  3 16:12:31 CEST 2003 - jg@suse.de

- Update to 0.6.4, changes:
  - Reworked build system (i.e. better Makefiles)
  - SyncAll works forward insead of backwards. Improves performance on some
    storage controlers.
  - Reworked /etc/init.d/drbd script (i.e. better support of different bash
    releases)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 26 11:43:36 CET 2003 - jg@suse.de

- Update to 0.6.3, changes:
  - Lockup of primary if secondary fails during resync. Fixed. (Stupid!)
  - Probabely SMP only deadlock in the drop-conection code path.
  - Improved connect code. (The old code could trap into a distributed
    deadlock, resulting in an endless connect/disconnect loop.)
  - The 'BitMap too small bug' was actually caused by a patch in
    SuSE's distribution kernel. This patch makes DRBD 'more' compatible
    with SuSE's kernel.
  - Improved code to allocate buffers for the rsynchronisation process.
    The old code allocated physical adjacent pages although the syncer
    does not need them! The old code could fail under high memory pressure.
- Removed BitMap too small patch (is part of 0.6.3)
- added /etc/ha.d/resource.d/datadisk to filelist so it is possible
  to install heartbeat after drbd
- removed unneeded /etc/ha.d/resource.d/drbd-control
