Thu Apr 30 20:29:35 UTC 2015 - mardnh@gmx.de

- add build condition "fenced_code" to conditionally run configure
  with "--with-fenced-code"
  Building with this condition enables PHP markdown extra-style fenced code
  sections, where your chunks of code are surrounded by ~~~ lines instead
  of being indented 4 spaces.

- update to 2.1.8a
- correct license in spec file. It's actually BSD-3-Clause
- added patch for fixing some comiler warnings:
  discount-fix-compile-warings.diff
- ran spec-cleaner and specfile cleanup

- change from version 2.1.8a
  When I put in the patch to ...
  * Change the mail demangler to a debian-specific ‘always mangle one way’ hack.
    (enabled with the configure.sh option –debian-glitch)
  I messed up the format string and made the mangled email address into a fixed
  bogus string. Sigh. Fixed (thanks to a patch from Alessandro Ghedini), updated
  (and I really have to expand the runtime configuration flags array to be long
  enough to fit 64 settings, but that’s a fix for a different day) and released.

- change from version 2.1.8
  After a year or so of letting the code sit and slowly accumulate fixes, a new
  version which fixes a wad of bugs and adds a few new features. Some of this
  code is front other people, and those changes will be marked with their names:

  * FINALLY address the bug where markdown extra-style footnotes lose numbering
    when they show up in nested element; I was not carrying the m-e reference#
    inside the footnotes structure, but was instead carrying it in the parent
    structure and not updating it. So I changed the footnotes structure to
    include the reference + the list of footnotes, which made the misnumbering
    go away on my tests.
  * Fix makefile distclean to cleanup all the generated files and corrected the
    names of the installed sample program man pages to end in .1
    (Mark Pizzolato mark@infocomm.com)
  * Change the mail demangler to a debian-specific ‘always mangle one way’ hack.
    (enabled with the configure.sh option –debian-glitch)
  * Add –with-unmangled-email compile-time flag to disable mailto: mangling
  * Allow the magic output filename -, which means send output to stdout instead
    of to a file.
  * Fix a bug where autolink + github flavored markdown absorbs the ^C eoln
    character into a link at the end of a line.
  * Tweak install.samples so that the user can supply a SAMPLE_PFX on the
    command line SAMPLE_PFX=discount- make install.samples to install the sample
    programs with a package-specific prefix.
  * Emit pages in utf-8 instead of us-ascii (simply a change to the
    Content-Type meta) (Nathan Phillip Brink binki@gentoo.org)
  * Patch the horrible list handler to support long numeric list items
    (George Hartzell hartzell@alerce.com)
  * Various bugfixes (Masayoshi Sekimura sekimura@gmail.com)
  * Fix support for CFLAGS=-m32 ./configure.sh by using CFLAGS for all build
    invokations of CC. (Nathan Phillip Brink binki@gentoo.org)
  * Github-style language attributes on fenced code blocks
    (Loren Segal lsegal@amazon.com)
  * When defining WORD & DWORD, check first for the MS Windows WinDef.h file;
    if found, include it instead of defining WORD & DWORD ourselves.
  * support url-encoded anchor links with –with-urlencoded-anchor option
    (Daisuke Murase typester@cpan.org)

- change from version 2.1.6
  does nothing except for some bugfixes (and ignores some particularly scary
  ones that I /must/ fix soon) and adds two small features.

  * A < at the end of the input is exactly the same as \<(space)
  * Markdown.pl does not appear to escape \<[nonwhite] sequences. Sigh.
  * Tweak the previous Markdown does not escape... commit to simply push out
    the backslash and back up to the start of the <[nonwhite] sequence,
    so -fnohtml will continue to work.
  * Treat hard <br/> (via two spaces) as whitespace.
  * Tweak divquote handling so that two adjacent divquotes won’t die if there
    is a space between the second > & leading %
  * Tweak one of the list tests back to the previous behavior (I’ve put in a
    hack for list indentation, and accidentally committed the changes. Oops!)

  The features are that I now use styles for table cell alignment instead of
  align=, and that I’m using the 3-clause BSD license for this release
  (because there is one widely used closed-source license that claims that you
  can’t dynamically link with code that uses the 4-clause license. Fine.
  I’ll 3-clause this release to make the stupid GPL happy.)
