    Handle terminals that do not support erasing the line by filling the

    The erasure was also causing the progress bar to flicker.
  * Add a gitlab CI script.  !8
  * tempfiles:

      find differences. Thanks to Hans-Christoph Steiner for the report.
      (Closes: #890904)
    - Recursively reset the permissions of temporary directories prior to
      deletion to ensure that non-writable permissions such as 0555 are removed
      and do not cause a traceback. (Closes: #891363)

      python3-pyxattr is not. Based on an patch by Doug Freed; thanks!

      itself.

      using ambiguous `l` variable names.
    - Add whitespace around operators and ensure 4-line indentation throughout.
  * debian/*:
    - Move DOS/MBR check into the testsuite.
    - Add explicit runtime dependency on python3-distutils as it was dropped in

    - Clarify that the Reproducible Builds project is not just about Debian.
    - Drop executable bit on doc/Makefile.

    Wise for the idea. (Closes: #893324)

- update to version 49:
  * Don't crash when we can't find the debug file in a matching debug
    package.  This repairs diffoscope for xserver-xorg and other
    packages.
  * Use libarchive to read metadata from ar archives. The output is
    more precise and less dependent on binutils version. The command
    line `ar` tool is not used any more so remove it from the required
    tools.
  * Split readelf --debug-dump output when examining ELF files. Based
    on a patch by Dhole.
  * Keep both .debug_str and .zdebug_str as ElfSection. Thanks to
    Niels Thykier for noticing the problem.
  * Fix a logic error in _install_debug_symbols. Thanks anthraxx for
    the report and the fix.
  * Use recursive containers for directory and only look at files with
    ending in .deb when looking for Build IDs. Both avoid looking at
    too many files when searching for matching debug packages. Thanks
    Helmut Grohne and Steven Chamberlain for the reports and
    tests. (Closes: #813052)
  * Add support for ICC profiles. This adds a Recommends on colord in
    Debian.
  * Harmonize spaces and commas in package list.
  * Update PPU files test data for FPC 3.0.0.
  * Update exepcted javap output for OpenJDK 1.8.
  * Stop specializing files from directories earlier than necessary.
  * Adding cd-iccdump package reference for Arch Linux.
  * Use HTTPS in Vcs-Git.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.7, no changes needed.
  * Use /git/ instead /cgit/ in Vcs-Browser.
