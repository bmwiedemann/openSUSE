  <title>An Open Source Implementation of DjVu</title>
  <description>DjVu is a Web-centric format and software platform for distributing
documents and images. DjVuLibre is an open source (GPL) implementation
of DjVu, including viewers, browser plug-ins, decoders, simple
encoders, and utilities. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF,
JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or
high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster, displays and
renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consumes less client
resources than competing formats. DjVu images display instantly and can
be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy rerendering. DjVu is used
by hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and noncommercial
Web sites around the world.</description>
