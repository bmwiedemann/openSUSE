%description
Devilspie 2 is based on the excellent program Devil's Pie by Ross Burton, and
takes a folder as in-data, and checks that folder for LUA scripts. These
scripts are run each time a window is opened, and the rules in them are applied
on the window.

Unfortunately the rules of the original Devil's Pie are not supported.
