   targets for the records management service.

Mon Mar  1 10:25:01 UTC 2021 - Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>

 * Renamed 'Authenticate Message' to 'Verify Message' in the 'Message' menu
   because it reflects better the performed operation.

   used to simplify the code for various actions in the main window.
 * Code responsible for enabling actions in the main window has been gathered
   into one method.
 * Improved GUI responsiveness when downloading message lists with complete
   new messages.
 * Suspending the worker pool does not affect tasks run via runSingle().
 * Added user_account_name field into upload_account_status structure. Sending

    dialogue is only shown when an explicit message download fails. 
  * A message in the notification area appears when the download 
    has been triggered by downloading message list. This should 
    reduce the amount of error dialogues generated.

    restricted privileges. Received messages are not automatically 
    downloaded when the user has no privileges to do that.

    occasionally.
