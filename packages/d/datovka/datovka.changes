    download buttons that could still be triggered. Triggering those 
    buttons in this situation could cause the application to crash.

    dialogue is only shown when an explicit message download fails. 
  * A message in the notification area appears when the download 
    has been triggered by downloading message list. This should 
    reduce the amount of error dialogues generated.

    restricted privileges. Received messages are not automatically 
    downloaded when the user has no privileges to do that.
- Changes for 4.5.1

    occasionally.
