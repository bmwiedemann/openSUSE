    <user>saschpe</user>
    <comment>- update to 1.7.5:
  * id 641904: Function in the call graphs are now shown based on first 
    appearance rather then alphabetical order.                      
  * id 616213: When customizing the HTML header $title now only generates 
    the title excluding the project name (which can still be      
    added using $projectname)                                                                                                           
  * Improved the look of the class index: all items now have equal spacing.
  * New option INTERACTIVE_SVG which when set to YES in combination with 
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT=svg will make doxygen generate interactive SVG 
    diagrams that support zooming and panning via the mouse (only for 
    large graphs).                                                
  * Added support for the Tcl programming language (thanks to Rene Zaumseil
    and Samuel Bentley for the patch).                          
  * Added @copyright command.                                                                                                           
  * added option MATHJAX_EXTENSIONS to provide additional extensions for 
    MathJax (thanks to David Munger for the patch).                
  * added option INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS which when enabled shows the fields 
    of simple classes and structs (with only public data fields) as a table 
    and inline in context (file/group/namespace/class) 
    provided this context is documented.                          
  * When using the server based search engine (SEARCHENGINE=YES and 
    SERVER_BASED_SEARCH=YES) doxygen now advertises a opensearch provider 
    for your project, that allows integrating the search directly in the 
    search field of the browser (thanks to Phil Lello for the patch). 
  * id 503239: Added new option CITE_BIB_FILES and LATEX_BIB_STYLE and a new 
    command \cite, allowing you to make references to literature (as defined 
    in one or more .bib files). This also works for output formats other 
    than LaTeX. The tool bibtex is required for this to work though. Thanks 
    to David Munger for the initial patch upon which this feature is based.                    
  * PHP namespaces are now shown as A\B in the output.</comment>

    <time>1323869593</time>
    <user>coolo</user>
    <comment>- updated to 1.7.6.1:
   * Doxygen now reports its cache usage (for the symbol and the 
     lookup cache) at the end of a run (if QUIET=NO), and 
     recommends settings for SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE and 
     LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE for your project if either cache is too 
     small. 
   * Added new option LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE to control the internal 
     cache doxygen uses to find symbols given their name and 
     a context. 
   * Python: added support for @staticmethod.
   * Python: scopes are now shown with . instead of :: 
   * id 665313: Space before @if was not preserved, causing 
     problems with inline @if .. @endif constructs.
   * id 665583: Fixed XHTML validity problem when using mscgen 
     graphs. 
   * id 665641: Fixed XHTML validity problem when 
     GENERATE_TREEVIEW was disabled. 
   * id 665720: Included patch to fix hang issue when non-empty 
     INCLUDE_PATH was used.
   * id 665778: Fixed parse issue when a comma appeared as part 
     of an enum's value. 

- updated to 1.7.6:
   * To improve the performance of loading the navigation tree, 
     the data is now split into multiple javascript files which 
     are loaded dynamically.
   * The selected member is now briefly highlighted in the HTML 
     output (when GENERATE_TREEVIEW is enabled).
   * The navigation tree (GENERATE_TREEVIEW) now shows the same 
     information as the index.</comment>

    <comment>- updated to 1.8.1.2:
  changes
  * doxygen now strips the leading indentation shared by the lines 
    in a @code..@endcode block. 
  * id 678218: Changed title of the SVG graphs from 'G' to the root 
    node of the graph. 
  * Integrated the root navigation tree in navtree.js for faster 
    loading
  * When the navigation tree is enabled, clicking jump to a line 
    in the source code view will now highlight the line. 
  features
  * Added button in the navigation tree to allow enabling/disabling 
    syncing the navigation tree with the content.
  * Extended the number of HTML entities with Greek letters and 
    other symbols (thanks to Charles Karney for the patch).
  * id 663645: Added support for C++11 strongly typed enums (enum 
    class E { ... }). 
  * VHDL code now has a new Design Overview page (thanks for

    <comment>- updated to 1.8.4:
  * id 686384: When INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS is enabled, also structs
    with simple typedefs will be inlined.
  * Doxywizard: scrolling with mouse wheel no longer affects the
    values in the expert view.
  * id 681733: More consistent warnings and errors.
  * Added support for &quot;clang assisted parsing&quot;, which allows the
    code to also be parsed via libclang (C/C++ frontend of LLVM)
    and can improve the quality of the syntax highting,
    cross-references, and call graphs, especially for template
    heavy C++ code. To enable this feature you have to configure
    doxygen with the --with-libclang option. Then you get two new
    configuration options: CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING to enable or
    disable parsing via clang and CLANG_OPTIONS to pass additional
    compiler options needed to compile the files. Note that
    enabling this feature has a significant performance penality.
  * Included patch donated by Intel which adds Docbook support.
    This can be enabled via GENERATE_DOCBOOK and the output
    location can be controlled using DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. Docbook
    specific sections can be added using
    \docbookonly ... \enddocbookonly
  * Added support for UNO IDL (interace language used in
    Open/Libre Office), thanks to Michael Stahl for the patch.
  * Included patch by Adrian Negreanu which stores data gathered
    by doxygen in a sqlite3 database. Currently still work in
    progress and can only be enabled using --with-sqlite3 during
    ./configure.
  * For interactive SVG graphs, edges are now highlighted when
    hovered by the mouse.
  * Include patch by Adrian Negreanu to show duration statistics</comment>

  * bugfixes
- removed upstreamed endless-loop.patch
- upstream patch to fix endless loop
  doxygen-1.4.8-endless-loop.patch 
- updated to 1.8.4:
  * id 686384: When INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS is enabled, also structs
    with simple typedefs will be inlined.
  * Doxywizard: scrolling with mouse wheel no longer affects the
    values in the expert view.
  * id 681733: More consistent warnings and errors.
  * Added support for &quot;clang assisted parsing&quot;, which allows the
    code to also be parsed via libclang (C/C++ frontend of LLVM)
    and can improve the quality of the syntax highting,
    cross-references, and call graphs, especially for template
    heavy C++ code. To enable this feature you have to configure
    doxygen with the --with-libclang option. Then you get two new
    configuration options: CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING to enable or
    disable parsing via clang and CLANG_OPTIONS to pass additional
    compiler options needed to compile the files. Note that
    enabling this feature has a significant performance penality.
  * Included patch donated by Intel which adds Docbook support.
    This can be enabled via GENERATE_DOCBOOK and the output
    location can be controlled using DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. Docbook
    specific sections can be added using
    \docbookonly ... \enddocbookonly
  * Added support for UNO IDL (interace language used in
    Open/Libre Office), thanks to Michael Stahl for the patch.
  * Included patch by Adrian Negreanu which stores data gathered
    by doxygen in a sqlite3 database. Currently still work in
    progress and can only be enabled using --with-sqlite3 during
    ./configure.
  * For interactive SVG graphs, edges are now highlighted when
    hovered by the mouse.
  * Include patch by Adrian Negreanu to show duration statistics
    after a run. You can enable this by running doxygen with the
    &quot;-d Time&quot; option.
  * Included patch by Markus Geimer which adds a new option
    LATEX_EXTRA_FILES which works similarily to HTML_EXTRA_FILES
    in that it copied specified files to the LaTeX output
    directory.
  * etc., see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/changelog.html
- Added url as source.
  Please see http://en.opensuse.org/SourceUrls
- updated to 1.8.3.1:
  Changes
  *  Changed to way the search results for multiple projects can 
     be linked together. A project is now no longer identified by 
     the tag files name but via new option EXTERNAL_SEARCH_ID giving 
     a bit more flexibility.
  *  Disabled the disk cache for member data. Allows removing quite 
     some complexity in doxygen and is not really needed now that 
     64bit systems with &gt;4GB RAM are becoming more common. Let me 
     know if you think you benefit from this caching.
  *  id 691607: Using $relpath$ in a custom footer could lead to 
     ambiguities when followed by a name that could also be a marker, 
     like 'search'. Now $relpath^ should be used instead. $relpath$ 
     is still supported for backward compatibility. 
  New features
  *  You can now use EXTENSION_MAPPING on files without any 
     extension using no_extension as placeholder (thanks to 
     Jason Majors for the patch).
  *  To make navindex section inside a layout file that 
     links to a specific URL you can use usergroup with the 
     url attribute.
  *  To make navindex section without any link inside a 
     layout file you can use usergroup with special title 
     [none]. 
  Details at: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/changelog.html
- updated to 1.8.3:
    Changes
    * Expanding the tree in an index page of the HTML output, will 
      now expand only one level instead of the whole sub-tree.
    * A blockquote in Markdown does no longer require a whitespace 
      after the last '&gt;' if the '&gt;' is followed by a newline.
    * id 682718: Included patch to add version info to all 
      generated template files (headers, footers, stylesheets, 
      layout files, etc). 
    New features
    * Added support for using external tools to index and search 
      through the HTML documentation. An example index tool is 
      provided (doxyindexer) and an example search engine 
      (doxysearch.cgi). To configure the external search engine 
      the following new options are added to the configuration 
      file: EXTERNAL_SEARCH (to enable the feature), 
      SEARCHENGINE_URL (to specify the URL of the search engine), 
      SEARCHDATA_FILE (to specify the name of the raw search 
      data to index), EXTRA_SEARCH_MAPPINGS (for search through 
      multiple projects). See the manual for details.
    * Added USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE config option to select a 
      markdown page to be used as the main page.
    * id 630645: This patch (contributed by Albert) adds support 
      for simple logic expressions for \cond, \if, and friends, 
      i.e. you can do \if (SOME_SECTION_NAME &amp;&amp; 
      (!THIS_ALTERNATIVE || THAT_ALTERNATIVE))
    * id 684152: Patch (contributed by Albert) adds a new 
      configuration option MATHJAX_FORMAT to select the MathJax 
      output format. Options are HTML-CSS, NativeMML, or SVG. 
    Bug Fixes
      * see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/changelog.html
- updated to 1.8.2:
    changes
    * Using a fenched block (~~~~) in Markdown without explicit 
      extension will now be interpreted as a @code..@endcode block 
      instead of @verbatim..@endverbatim.
    * Classes inheriting from an class that is outside the scope 
      of doxygen are still shown in diagrams. This does not hold 
      for usage relations. 
    new features
    * Added support for C++11.
    * Made several improvements to the way Objective-C categories 
      and protocols are handled:
    * Added option HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET which allows adding an 
      additional stylesheet without completely replacing 
      doxygen.css.
    * Added option AUTOLINK_SUPPORT which can be used to 
      enable/disable autolinking globally.
    * Included language updates for Czech, Spanish, Greek, Slovak, 
      and Esparanto. 
    etc. see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/changelog.html

    node of the graph. 
  * Integrated the root navigation tree in navtree.js for faster 
    loading
  * When the navigation tree is enabled, clicking jump to a line 
    in the source code view will now highlight the line. 
  features
  * Added button in the navigation tree to allow enabling/disabling 
    syncing the navigation tree with the content.
  * Extended the number of HTML entities with Greek letters and 
    other symbols (thanks to Charles Karney for the patch).
  * id 663645: Added support for C++11 strongly typed enums (enum 
    class E { ... }). 
  * VHDL code now has a new Design Overview page (thanks for 
    Martin Kreis for the patch). Requires HAVE_DOT=YES, and 
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT=svg.
  * id 677678: Added support for strong and weak attributes in 
    Objective-C properties. 
  * bugfixes

  * etc., see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/changelog.html
- updated to 1.7.6.1:
   * Doxygen now reports its cache usage (for the symbol and the 
     lookup cache) at the end of a run (if QUIET=NO), and 
     recommends settings for SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE and 
     LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE for your project if either cache is too 
     small. 
   * Added new option LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE to control the internal 
     cache doxygen uses to find symbols given their name and 
     a context. 
   * Python: added support for @staticmethod.
   * Python: scopes are now shown with . instead of :: 
   * id 665313: Space before @if was not preserved, causing 
     problems with inline @if .. @endif constructs.
   * id 665583: Fixed XHTML validity problem when using mscgen

     are loaded dynamically.
   * The selected member is now briefly highlighted in the HTML 
     output (when GENERATE_TREEVIEW is enabled).
   * The navigation tree (GENERATE_TREEVIEW) now shows the same 
     information as the index.
   * The navindex section of layout now also controls what is 
     shown in the navigation tree.
   * Improved HTML output support for IE9.
   * Included redesigned VHDL parser (thanks to Martin Kreis 
     for the patch)
   * When a class/structs has many (&gt;15) members of the same type, 
     only the first 10 are shown in the UML diagram.

     compact.  
   * Update of the French translation.

    the title excluding the project name (which can still be      
    added using $projectname)                                                                                                           
  * Improved the look of the class index: all items now have equal spacing.
  * New option INTERACTIVE_SVG which when set to YES in combination with 
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT=svg will make doxygen generate interactive SVG 
    diagrams that support zooming and panning via the mouse (only for

    and inline in context (file/group/namespace/class) 
    provided this context is documented.                          
  * When using the server based search engine (SEARCHENGINE=YES and 
    SERVER_BASED_SEARCH=YES) doxygen now advertises a opensearch provider 
    for your project, that allows integrating the search directly in the 
    search field of the browser (thanks to Phil Lello for the patch). 
  * id 503239: Added new option CITE_BIB_FILES and LATEX_BIB_STYLE and a new 
    command \cite, allowing you to make references to literature (as defined 
    in one or more .bib files). This also works for output formats other 
    than LaTeX. The tool bibtex is required for this to work though. Thanks 
    to David Munger for the initial patch upon which this feature is based.

    have many characters (for example a function returning a pointer
    to a template class).

              header files contained using statements.

  (dont-exit-on-warning.patch)
- updated to version 1.5.0
  *  Cleaned up the internal structures to make them smaller,
     and made doxygen use a temporary file to store the parse
     results (instead of keeping them in memory), which will
     further reduce the memory usage, especially for large projects
  *  Sections produces by \note, \warning, \remarks etc, now have
     a class label in the generated HTML (&lt;dl&gt; tag) so you can give
     them a distinct style using a non-default stylesheet

    <comment>Restore build on openSUSE 15.6 and SLE15 SP6/SP7

On Leap15/SLE15 a newer GCC is needed to build against Qt6. On SLE15 the default clang7 is too old for doxygen with libclang support, use clang17 instead. (forwarded request 1295341 from fsirl)</comment>
