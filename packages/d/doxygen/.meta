  <title>Automated C, C++, and Java Documentation Generator</title>
  <description>Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++, Java, and IDL. It can
generate an online class browser (in HTML) and an offline reference
manual (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source files. The
documentation is extracted directly from the sources. Doxygen is
developed on a Linux platform, but it runs on most other UNIX flavors
as well. An executable for Windows 95/NT is also available.</description>
