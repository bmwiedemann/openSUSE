    source browsing.
  * bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 20 16:37:04 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.8.4:
  * id 686384: When INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS is enabled, also structs 
    with simple typedefs will be inlined.
  * Doxywizard: scrolling with mouse wheel no longer affects the 
    values in the expert view.
  * id 681733: More consistent warnings and errors. 
  * Added support for "clang assisted parsing", which allows the 
    code to also be parsed via libclang (C/C++ frontend of LLVM) 
    and can improve the quality of the syntax highting, 
    cross-references, and call graphs, especially for template 
    heavy C++ code. To enable this feature you have to configure 
    doxygen with the --with-libclang option. Then you get two new 
    configuration options: CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING to enable or 
    disable parsing via clang and CLANG_OPTIONS to pass additional 
    compiler options needed to compile the files. Note that 
    enabling this feature has a significant performance penality.
  * Included patch donated by Intel which adds Docbook support. 
    This can be enabled via GENERATE_DOCBOOK and the output 
    location can be controlled using DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. Docbook 
    specific sections can be added using 
    \docbookonly ... \enddocbookonly
  * Added support for UNO IDL (interace language used in 
    Open/Libre Office), thanks to Michael Stahl for the patch.
  * Included patch by Adrian Negreanu which stores data gathered 
    by doxygen in a sqlite3 database. Currently still work in 
    progress and can only be enabled using --with-sqlite3 during 
    ./configure.
  * For interactive SVG graphs, edges are now highlighted when 
    hovered by the mouse.
  * Include patch by Adrian Negreanu to show duration statistics 
    after a run. You can enable this by running doxygen with the 
    "-d Time" option.
  * Included patch by Markus Geimer which adds a new option 
    LATEX_EXTRA_FILES which works similarily to HTML_EXTRA_FILES 
    in that it copied specified files to the LaTeX output 
    directory.
  * etc., see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/changelog.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 26 07:35:51 UTC 2013 - mmeister@suse.com

- Added url as source.
  Please see http://en.opensuse.org/SourceUrls

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 22 08:07:54 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.8.3.1:
  Changes
  *  Changed to way the search results for multiple projects can
     be linked together. A project is now no longer identified by
     the tag files name but via new option EXTERNAL_SEARCH_ID giving
     a bit more flexibility.
  *  Disabled the disk cache for member data. Allows removing quite
     some complexity in doxygen and is not really needed now that
     64bit systems with >4GB RAM are becoming more common. Let me
     know if you think you benefit from this caching.
  *  id 691607: Using $relpath$ in a custom footer could lead to
     ambiguities when followed by a name that could also be a marker,
     like 'search'. Now $relpath^ should be used instead. $relpath$
     is still supported for backward compatibility.

  New features
  *  You can now use EXTENSION_MAPPING on files without any
     extension using no_extension as placeholder (thanks to
     Jason Majors for the patch).
  *  To make navindex section inside a layout file that
     links to a specific URL you can use usergroup with the
     url attribute.
  *  To make navindex section without any link inside a
     layout file you can use usergroup with special title
     [none].

Mon Aug 20 07:17:15 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.8.2:
    changes
    * Using a fenched block (~~~~) in Markdown without explicit 
      extension will now be interpreted as a @code..@endcode block 
      instead of @verbatim..@endverbatim.
    * Classes inheriting from an class that is outside the scope 
      of doxygen are still shown in diagrams. This does not hold 
      for usage relations. 
    new features
    * Added support for C++11.
    * Made several improvements to the way Objective-C categories 
      and protocols are handled:
    * Added option HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET which allows adding an 
      additional stylesheet without completely replacing 
      doxygen.css.
    * Added option AUTOLINK_SUPPORT which can be used to 
      enable/disable autolinking globally.
    * Included language updates for Czech, Spanish, Greek, Slovak, 
      and Esparanto. 
    etc. see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/changelog.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 13 08:27:44 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.8.1.2:
  changes

    in a @code..@endcode block.
  * id 678218: Changed title of the SVG graphs from 'G' to the root
    node of the graph.
  * Integrated the root navigation tree in navtree.js for faster
    loading
  * When the navigation tree is enabled, clicking jump to a line
    in the source code view will now highlight the line.
  features
  * Added button in the navigation tree to allow enabling/disabling
    syncing the navigation tree with the content.
  * Extended the number of HTML entities with Greek letters and
    other symbols (thanks to Charles Karney for the patch).
  * id 663645: Added support for C++11 strongly typed enums (enum
    class E { ... }).
  * VHDL code now has a new Design Overview page (thanks for
    Martin Kreis for the patch). Requires HAVE_DOT=YES, and
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT=svg.
  * id 677678: Added support for strong and weak attributes in
    Objective-C properties.
  * bugfixes

Mon Dec  5 09:44:06 UTC 2011 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.7.6:
   * To improve the performance of loading the navigation tree,
     the data is now split into multiple javascript files which
     are loaded dynamically.
   * The selected member is now briefly highlighted in the HTML
     output (when GENERATE_TREEVIEW is enabled).
   * The navigation tree (GENERATE_TREEVIEW) now shows the same
     information as the index.
   * The navindex section of layout now also controls what is
     shown in the navigation tree.
   * Improved HTML output support for IE9.
   * Included redesigned VHDL parser (thanks to Martin Kreis
     for the patch)
   * When a class/structs has many (>15) members of the same type,
     only the first 10 are shown in the UML diagram.

   * Update of the French translation.

    the title excluding the project name (which can still be
    added using $projectname)
  * Improved the look of the class index: all items now have equal spacing.
  * New option INTERACTIVE_SVG which when set to YES in combination with
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT=svg will make doxygen generate interactive SVG
    diagrams that support zooming and panning via the mouse (only for
    large graphs).
  * Added support for the Tcl programming language (thanks to Rene Zaumseil
    and Samuel Bentley for the patch).
  * Added @copyright command.
  * added option MATHJAX_EXTENSIONS to provide additional extensions for
    MathJax (thanks to David Munger for the patch).
  * added option INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS which when enabled shows the fields

    and inline in context (file/group/namespace/class)
    provided this context is documented.
  * When using the server based search engine (SEARCHENGINE=YES and

  * id 503239: Added new option CITE_BIB_FILES and LATEX_BIB_STYLE and a new
    command \cite, allowing you to make references to literature (as defined
    in one or more .bib files). This also works for output formats other
    than LaTeX. The tool bibtex is required for this to work though. Thanks
    to David Munger for the initial patch upon which this feature is based.
  * PHP namespaces are now shown as A\B in the output.
  * Added new \snippet command that can be used to include marked sections
    from a source file. See http://www.doxygen.org/commands.html#cmdsnippet

 - Changes
  * id 580924, 541234: Replaced the PHP based search engine by a

  Changes
  * Completely rewrote the doxywizard. Main changes:
    * It is now based on Qt version 4. (4.3 or higher is required)
    * Different layout that allows easy switching between wizard and
      expert mode, without losing settings.
    * Running doxygen can be done without first having to save the 
      configuration file.
    * For HTML output, there is a button to show the results in the
      default browser.
    * Option to change the default configuration that is used when
      you first start the wizard.
    * Non-default options are shown with red label, and there is 
      context menu to reset them back to the default.-
