-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 20 16:41:54 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 1.8.4:
  * id 686384: When INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS is enabled, also structs
    with simple typedefs will be inlined.
  * Doxywizard: scrolling with mouse wheel no longer affects the
    values in the expert view.
  * id 681733: More consistent warnings and errors.
  * Added support for "clang assisted parsing", which allows the
    code to also be parsed via libclang (C/C++ frontend of LLVM)
    and can improve the quality of the syntax highting,
    cross-references, and call graphs, especially for template
    heavy C++ code. To enable this feature you have to configure
    doxygen with the --with-libclang option. Then you get two new
    configuration options: CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING to enable or
    disable parsing via clang and CLANG_OPTIONS to pass additional
    compiler options needed to compile the files. Note that
    enabling this feature has a significant performance penality.
  * Included patch donated by Intel which adds Docbook support.
    This can be enabled via GENERATE_DOCBOOK and the output
    location can be controlled using DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. Docbook
    specific sections can be added using
    \docbookonly ... \enddocbookonly
  * Added support for UNO IDL (interace language used in
    Open/Libre Office), thanks to Michael Stahl for the patch.
  * Included patch by Adrian Negreanu which stores data gathered
    by doxygen in a sqlite3 database. Currently still work in
    progress and can only be enabled using --with-sqlite3 during
    ./configure.
  * For interactive SVG graphs, edges are now highlighted when
    hovered by the mouse.
  * Include patch by Adrian Negreanu to show duration statistics
    after a run. You can enable this by running doxygen with the
    "-d Time" option.
  * Included patch by Markus Geimer which adds a new option
    LATEX_EXTRA_FILES which works similarily to HTML_EXTRA_FILES
    in that it copied specified files to the LaTeX output
    directory.
  * etc., see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/changelog.html

- updated to 1.8.3.1:
  Changes
  *  Changed to way the search results for multiple projects can 
     be linked together. A project is now no longer identified by 
     the tag files name but via new option EXTERNAL_SEARCH_ID giving 
     a bit more flexibility.
  *  Disabled the disk cache for member data. Allows removing quite 
     some complexity in doxygen and is not really needed now that 
     64bit systems with >4GB RAM are becoming more common. Let me 
     know if you think you benefit from this caching.
  *  id 691607: Using $relpath$ in a custom footer could lead to 
     ambiguities when followed by a name that could also be a marker, 
     like 'search'. Now $relpath^ should be used instead. $relpath$ 
     is still supported for backward compatibility. 

  New features
  *  You can now use EXTENSION_MAPPING on files without any 
     extension using no_extension as placeholder (thanks to 
     Jason Majors for the patch).
  *  To make navindex section inside a layout file that 
     links to a specific URL you can use usergroup with the 
     url attribute.
  *  To make navindex section without any link inside a 
     layout file you can use usergroup with special title 
     [none].

- updated to 1.8.3:
    Changes
    * Expanding the tree in an index page of the HTML output, will 
      now expand only one level instead of the whole sub-tree.

      after the last '>' if the '>' is followed by a newline.
    * id 682718: Included patch to add version info to all 
      generated template files (headers, footers, stylesheets, 
      layout files, etc). 
    New features
    * Added support for using external tools to index and search 
      through the HTML documentation. An example index tool is 
      provided (doxyindexer) and an example search engine 
      (doxysearch.cgi). To configure the external search engine 
      the following new options are added to the configuration 
      file: EXTERNAL_SEARCH (to enable the feature), 
      SEARCHENGINE_URL (to specify the URL of the search engine), 
      SEARCHDATA_FILE (to specify the name of the raw search 
      data to index), EXTRA_SEARCH_MAPPINGS (for search through 
      multiple projects). See the manual for details.
    * Added USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE config option to select a 
      markdown page to be used as the main page.
    * id 630645: This patch (contributed by Albert) adds support 
      for simple logic expressions for \cond, \if, and friends, 
      i.e. you can do \if (SOME_SECTION_NAME && 
      (!THIS_ALTERNATIVE || THAT_ALTERNATIVE))
    * id 684152: Patch (contributed by Albert) adds a new 
      configuration option MATHJAX_FORMAT to select the MathJax 
      output format. Options are HTML-CSS, NativeMML, or SVG.

      extension will now be interpreted as a @code..@endcode block 
      instead of @verbatim..@endverbatim.
    * Classes inheriting from an class that is outside the scope 
      of doxygen are still shown in diagrams. This does not hold 
      for usage relations. 
    new features
    * Added support for C++11.
    * Made several improvements to the way Objective-C categories 
      and protocols are handled:

    node of the graph. 
  * Integrated the root navigation tree in navtree.js for faster 
    loading
  * When the navigation tree is enabled, clicking jump to a line 
    in the source code view will now highlight the line. 
  features
  * Added button in the navigation tree to allow enabling/disabling 
    syncing the navigation tree with the content.
  * Extended the number of HTML entities with Greek letters and 
    other symbols (thanks to Charles Karney for the patch).

- updated to version 1.5.5
  Changes:
  *  Pages created with @page are now chapters in the LaTeX and RTF
     output and treeviews, and directly follow the mainpage.
     Also the project name is not longer repeated for each chapter.
    * For dot graphs with an edge with more than ten labels, only
      the first ten are shown followed by an ellipsis; done
      to prevent very long dot runs resulting in unreadable graphs.
    * Use of pdflatex with hyperlinks is now the default.
    * C++ preprocessor macro names are now replaced in the comments
    * The options SOURCE_BROWSER, CALL_GRAPH, CALLER_GRAPH,

      the second and third argument of a \class command, when
      the documentation is already in front of a class definition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 11:56:25 CET 2007 - anosek@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.5.3
  Changes:
  * When OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C is enabled then a struct definition

    in the output as a struct of type S_t and the typedef itself
    is omitted (previousily _S was shown as well as a typedef
    of the form typedef _S S_t).
  * Improved the line-breaking rules for members whose return types
    have many characters (for example a function returning a pointer
    to a template class).
  * Multiple brief and detailed descriptions are now possible.
    It is still not recommended to make use of them, but at least
    no documentation is silently hidden when there are two brief
    or two detailed descriptions for the same entity.
  * Improved dot layout control and page sizing to better fit
    images on the screen and paper. 
  New features:
  * Added support for aliases with arguments, see the manual
    for more information.
  * Added HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS option which, when enabled, will
    produce sections in the HTML output that can be expanded/collapsed.
    Currently used for diagrams and graphs.
  * Added support for type constraints as available in the C# language
    ("where" clause)
  * id 332263: Added new option EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES that when set to YES
    will extract the contents of anonymous namespaces and show
    then in the output.
  * id 423765: Added support for <see cref="SomeSymbol"/> style XML comments.
  * id 426971: Added QT_AUTOBRIEF config option, which has the same meaning
    as JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF only now for /*! .. */ style comment blocks.
  * id 435108: Reintroduced the MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH option as a means
    to further reduce the size of a graph.

  *  Sections produces by \note, \warning, \remarks etc, now have
     a class label in the generated HTML (<dl> tag) so you can give
