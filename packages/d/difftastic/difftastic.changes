Thu Aug 29 00:41:02 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 0.60.0:
  * Fixed a crash (introduced in 0.59) when the final changed hunk
    included the last line of the file
  * Fixed an issue where files with no common content would show
    duplicate hunks
  * Fixed a performance issue when files had extremely long lines
    (e.g. 100,000+ characters).
- remove cargo_audit, as it's now included in cargo_vendor
- add new build dependency (libstdc++)
- exclude mdbook, so difftastic can be built for Leap
- disable tests for now, as too many fail, software still works

Sun May 12 12:19:06 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 0.58.0:

    off showing fewer changes in case of parse errors
  * Update C, C++, CMake, CSS, Elm, Go, Lua and Python parsers
  * --strip-cr now defaults to on
  * add a manpage
  * Fix a memory leak and improved performance in some cases
  * Fix a crash when unable to detect the terminal width (eshell)
  * Considers $COLUMNS when detecting the terminal width

Tue Apr  9 19:52:08 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- 0.57.0:
  Parsing
  * Text file detection is now stricter, considering null bytes as a
    hint that files are binaries.

  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue where hidden files (filename starting with .) were
    ignored when diffing directories.
  * Scheme now uses the same slider heuristics as other lisps,
    preferring the outer delimiter.
  * Fixed an issue with line-based diffing where only the first line
    in a large changed region was highlighted. This was particularly
    noticeable when diffing brand new files.

  Display
  * Fixed an issue when reporting changes in binary files, where
    trailing whitespace was inconsistent with other changes shown.

Sun Mar 24 13:02:15 UTC 2024 - Gordon Leung <pirateclip@protonmail.com>

- 0.56.1:
  Parsing
  * Added support for Objective-C and VHDL.
  * Files starting with <?xml are now parsed as XML.
  * Fixed a munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer crash on parsing some large files,
  * particularly JSON.
  * Makefile*.in is now detected as Makefile syntax.
  * Improved shebang parsing with whitespace
  * Added support for Scheme and Smali.
  *
  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue with runaway memory usage on text files with very long lines.

  Display
  * The default display width for tabs has changed to 4.
  * Fixed an issue where difftastic would sometimes output
    literal tabs rather than respecting the display width for tabs.
  * Fixed an issue where all files would show a permissions change
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Fixed an issue with paths not showing the containing directory
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Difftastic now correctly reports file permission changes when
    called from git diff.
  * Fixed an issue with the experimental JSON display mode where it
    ignored --skip-unchanged.
  * Fixed an issue with tabs not being replaced in single-column display.

- 0.53.1:
  * Parsing: Add support for SCSS,  Improve Kotlin support, and
    detect snap files (Jest snapshots) as JavaScript files
  * Fix an issue where adding or removing blank lines would be
    ignored by the textual diffing logic.
  * Directory diffing now respects .gitignore files.
  * New --sort-paths option for sorting files by path
  * New --strip-cr for improved diffing in mixed environment
  * The option --skip-unchanged now has a corresponding environment
    option DFT_SKIP_UNCHANGED
