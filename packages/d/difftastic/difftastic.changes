  * Update C, C++, CMake, CSS, Elm, Go, Lua and Python parsers
  * --strip-cr now defaults to on
  * add a manpage
  * Fix a memory leak and improved performance in some cases
  * Fix a crash when unable to detect the terminal width (eshell)

Tue Apr  9 19:52:08 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- 0.57.0:
  Parsing
  * Text file detection is now stricter, considering null bytes as a
    hint that files are binaries.

  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue where hidden files (filename starting with .) were
    ignored when diffing directories.
  * Scheme now uses the same slider heuristics as other lisps,
    preferring the outer delimiter.
  * Fixed an issue with line-based diffing where only the first line
    in a large changed region was highlighted. This was particularly
    noticeable when diffing brand new files.

  Display
  * Fixed an issue when reporting changes in binary files, where
    trailing whitespace was inconsistent with other changes shown.

  *
  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue with runaway memory usage on text files with very long lines.

  Display
  * The default display width for tabs has changed to 4.
  * Fixed an issue where difftastic would sometimes output
    literal tabs rather than respecting the display width for tabs.
  * Fixed an issue where all files would show a permissions change
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Fixed an issue with paths not showing the containing directory
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Difftastic now correctly reports file permission changes when
    called from git diff.
  * Fixed an issue with the experimental JSON display mode where it
    ignored --skip-unchanged.
  * Fixed an issue with tabs not being replaced in single-column display.

    option DFT_SKIP_UNCHANGED
