- update to 0.63.0:
  Diffing
  * When diffing directories, difftastic now ignores the .git
    directory.

  Display
  * Fixed an issue where --display=side-by-side-show-both would
    not use a two-column display when one file was empty.

  Command Line Interface
  * Difftastic no longer accepts the --missing-as-empty argument.
    This argument has had no effect since 0.46.

  Parsing
  * File detection now supports Windows-1252 encoded text (an
    extension of ISO-8859-1), and is stricter about UTF-16 detection.
  * Updated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Elixir, LaTeX,
    Make, Nix, Rust and YAML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 27 13:08:43 UTC 2024 - munix9@googlemail.com

- update to 0.62.0:
  * Improved handling of multiline strings, which could cause a
    crash if they occurred at the end of the file. This was
    particularly noticeable with YAML.
  * Improved language detection when one argument is a named pipe.
  * Updated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Bash, C, C++, C#,
    CSS, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Julia, Lua,
    Objective-C, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, TOML, TypeScript
    and XML.
  * Improved syntax highlighting, particularly for keywords.

- update to 0.61.0:
  * Side-by-side display is now smarter on very wide terminals
    when the content is narrow.
  * Fixed a crash (introduced in 0.60) when the final line in a
    file does not have a trailing newline and occurs more than
    once in the file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Packaging changes:
  * Disable cargo vendor service update to avoid breaking
    dependency changes and reenable tests.
  * Add cargo vendor filter to reduce vendor tarball size
    significantly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 29 00:41:02 UTC 2024 - Richard Rahl <rrahl0@opensuse.org>

- update to 0.60.0:
  * Fixed a crash (introduced in 0.59) when the final changed hunk
    included the last line of the file
  * Fixed an issue where files with no common content would show
    duplicate hunks
  * Fixed a performance issue when files had extremely long lines
    (e.g. 100,000+ characters).
- remove cargo_audit, as it's now included in cargo_vendor
- add new build dependency (libstdc++)
- exclude mdbook, so difftastic can be built for Leap
- disable tests for now, as too many fail, software still works

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 12 12:19:06 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 0.58.0:
  * Produces better diffs by preserving parsed structure, trading
    off showing fewer changes in case of parse errors
  * Update C, C++, CMake, CSS, Elm, Go, Lua and Python parsers
  * --strip-cr now defaults to on
  * add a manpage
  * Fix a memory leak and improved performance in some cases
  * Fix a crash when unable to detect the terminal width (eshell)
  * Considers $COLUMNS when detecting the terminal width

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  9 19:52:08 UTC 2024 - Martin Schreiner <martin.schreiner@suse.com>

- 0.57.0:
  Parsing
  * Text file detection is now stricter, considering null bytes as a
    hint that files are binaries.

  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue where hidden files (filename starting with .) were
    ignored when diffing directories.
  * Scheme now uses the same slider heuristics as other lisps,
    preferring the outer delimiter.
  * Fixed an issue with line-based diffing where only the first line
    in a large changed region was highlighted. This was particularly
    noticeable when diffing brand new files.

  Display
  * Fixed an issue when reporting changes in binary files, where
    trailing whitespace was inconsistent with other changes shown.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 24 13:02:15 UTC 2024 - Gordon Leung <pirateclip@protonmail.com>

- 0.56.1:
  Parsing
  * Added support for Objective-C and VHDL.
  * Files starting with <?xml are now parsed as XML.
  * Fixed a munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer crash on parsing some large files,
  * particularly JSON.
  * Makefile*.in is now detected as Makefile syntax.
  * Improved shebang parsing with whitespace
  * Added support for Scheme and Smali.
  *
  Diffing
  * Fixed an issue with runaway memory usage on text files with very long lines.

  Display
  * The default display width for tabs has changed to 4.
  * Fixed an issue where difftastic would sometimes output
    literal tabs rather than respecting the display width for tabs.
  * Fixed an issue where all files would show a permissions change
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Fixed an issue with paths not showing the containing directory
    when using difftastic with git difftool.
  * Difftastic now correctly reports file permission changes when
    called from git diff.
  * Fixed an issue with the experimental JSON display mode where it
    ignored --skip-unchanged.
  * Fixed an issue with tabs not being replaced in single-column display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  8 18:28:20 UTC 2024 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- 0.54.0:
  * Support reporting file permission changes
  * Support for Salesforce Apex, improve Clojure and Haskell
  * bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 26 19:11:26 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- 0.53.1:
  * Parsing: Add support for SCSS,  Improve Kotlin support, and
    detect snap files (Jest snapshots) as JavaScript files
  * Fix an issue where adding or removing blank lines would be
    ignored by the textual diffing logic.
  * Directory diffing now respects .gitignore files.
  * New --sort-paths option for sorting files by path
  * New --strip-cr for improved diffing in mixed environment
  * The option --skip-unchanged now has a corresponding environment
    option DFT_SKIP_UNCHANGED
