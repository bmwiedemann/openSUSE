  <title>Lightweight, Easy-to-Configure DNS Forwarder and DHCP Server</title>
  <description>Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy-to-configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
server. It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small
network. It can serve the names of local machines that are not in the
global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows
machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in DNS with names
configured either in each host or in a central configuration file.
Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network
booting of diskless machines.</description>
