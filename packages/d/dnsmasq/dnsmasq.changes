Wed Feb 14 17:39:46 UTC 2024 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- update to 2.90:
  * CVE-2023-50387, CVE-2023-50868, bsc#1219823, bsc#1219826:
    Denial Of Service while trying to validate specially crafted
    DNSSEC responses
  * CVE-2023-49441, bsc#1226091: integer overflow via forward_query
  * Fix reversion in --rev-server introduced in 2.88 which caused
    breakage if the prefix length is not exactly divisible by 8
    (IPv4) or 4 (IPv6).
  * Fix possible SEGV when there server(s) for a particular domain
    are configured, but no server which is not qualified for a
    particular domain.
  * Set the default maximum DNS UDP packet sice to 1232.
    Obsoletes: dnsmasq-CVE-2023-28450.patch
  * Add --no-dhcpv4-interface and --no-dhcpv6-interface for better
    control over which inetrfaces are providing DHCP service.
  * Fix issue with stale caching
  * Add configurable caching for arbitrary RR-types.
  * Add --filter-rr option, to filter arbitrary RR-types.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  6 09:27:27 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 2.89:
  * Fix bug introduced in 2.88 (commit fe91134b) which can result
    in corruption of the DNS cache internal data structures and
    logging of "cache internal error". This has only been seen
    in one place in the wild, and it took considerable effort
    to even generate a test case to reproduce it, but there's
    no way to be sure it won't strike, and the effect is to break
    the cache badly. Installations with DNSSEC enabled are more
    likely to see the problem, but not running DNSSEC does not
    guarantee that it won't happen. Thanks to Timo van Roermund
    for reporting the bug and for his great efforts in chasing
    it down. (boo#1207174)
- remove no longer needed rpmlintrc filters

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 23 07:48:29 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.88:
  * Fix bug in --dynamic-host when an interface has /16 IPv4
  * address.
  * Add --fast-dns-retry option. This gives dnsmasq the ability
    to originate retries for upstream DNS queries itself, rather
    than relying on the downstream client. This is most useful
    when doing DNSSEC over unreliable upstream networks. It comes
    with some cost in memory usage and network bandwidth.
  * Add --use-stale-cache option. When set, if a DNS name exists
    in the cache, but its time-to-live has expired, dnsmasq will
    return the data anyway.
  * handle removal of whole files or entries within files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 26 09:21:37 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.87 (bsc#1197872, CVE-2022-0934):
  * Allow arbitrary prefix lengths in --rev-server and
    --domain=....,local
  * Replace --address=/#/..... functionality which got
    missed in the 2.86 domain search rewrite.
  * Add --nftset option, like --ipset but for the newer nftables.
  * Add --filter-A and --filter-AAAA options, to remove IPv4 or IPv6
    addresses from DNS answers.
  * Fix crash doing netbooting when --port is set to zero
    to disable the DNS server. Thanks to Drexl Johannes
    for the bug report.
  * Generalise --dhcp-relay. Sending via broadcast/multicast is
    now supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 and the configuration
    syntax made easier (but backwards compatible).
  * Add snooping of IPv6 prefix-delegations to the DHCP-relay system.
  * Finesse parsing of --dhcp-remoteid and --dhcp-subscrid. To be treated
    as hex, the pattern must consist of only hex digits AND contain
    at least one ':'. Thanks to Bengt-Erik Sandstrom who tripped
    over a pattern consisting of a decimal number which was interpreted
    surprisingly.
  * Include client address in TFTP file-not-found error reports.
    Thanks to Stefan Rink for the initial patch, which has been
    re-worked by me (srk). All bugs mine.
  * Note in manpage the change in behaviour of -address. This behaviour
    actually changed in v2.86, but was undocumented there. From 2.86 on,
    (eg) --address=/example.com/1.2.3.4 ONLY applies to A queries. All other
    types of query will be sent upstream. Pre 2.86, that would catch the
    whole example.com domain and queries for other types would get
    a local NODATA answer. The pre-2.86 behaviour is still available,
    by configuring --address=/example.com/1.2.3.4 --local=/example.com/
  * Fix problem with binding DHCP sockets to an individual interface.
    Despite the fact that the system call tales the interface _name_ as
    a parameter, it actually, binds the socket to interface _index_.
    Deleting the interface and creating a new one with the same name
    leaves the socket bound to the old index. (Creating new sockets
    always allocates a fresh index, they are not reused). We now
    take this behaviour into account and keep up with changing indexes.
  * Add --conf-script configuration option.
  * Enhance --domain to accept, for instance,
    --domain=net2.thekelleys.org.uk,eth2 so that hosts get a domain
    which relects the interface they are attached to in a way which
    doesn't require hard-coding addresses. Thanks to Sten Spans for
    the idea.
  * Fix write-after-free error in DHCPv6 server code.
    CVE-2022-0934 refers.
  * Add the ability to specify destination port in
    DHCP-relay mode. This change also removes a previous bug
    where --dhcp-alternate-port would affect the port used
    to relay _to_ as well as the port being listened on.
    The new feature allows configuration to provide bug-for-bug
    compatibility, if required. Thanks to Damian Kaczkowski 
    for the feature suggestion.
  * Bound the value of UDP packet size in the EDNS0 header of
    forwarded queries to the configured or default value of
    edns-packet-max. There's no point letting a client set a larger
    value if we're unable to return the answer. Thanks to Bertie
    Taylor for pointing out the problem and supplying the patch.

Fri Sep 17 11:10:17 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Update to 2.86:
  * Handle DHCPREBIND requests in the DHCPv6 server code.
  * Fix bug which caused dnsmasq to lose track of processes forked
    to handle TCP DNS connections under heavy load.
  * Major rewrite of the DNS server and domain handling code. This
    should be largely transparent, but it drastically improves
    performance and reduces memory foot-print when configuring
    large numbers of domains.
  * Revise resource handling for number of concurrent DNS queries.
  * Improve efficiency of DNSSEC.
  * Connection track mark based DNS query filtering.
  * Allow smaller than 64 prefix lengths in synth-domain, with
    caveats.
    --synth-domain=1234:4567::/56,example.com is now valid.
  * Make domains generated by --synth-domain appear in replies
    when in authoritative mode.
  * Ensure CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is available when conntrack
    is configured.
  * When --dhcp-hostsfile --dhcp-optsfile and --addn-hosts are
    given a directory as argument, define the order in which files
    within that directory are read (alphabetical order of filename).

Mon Apr 19 20:46:49 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Update to 2.85:
  * Fix problem with DNS retries in 2.83/2.84.
  * Tweak sort order of tags in get-version.
  * Avoid treating a --dhcp-host which has an IPv6 address as
    eligible for use with DHCPv4 on the grounds that it has
    no address, and vice-versa.
  * Add --dynamic-host option: A and AAAA records which take their
    network part from the network of a local interface. Useful
    for routers with dynamically prefixes.
  * Teach --bogus-nxdomain and --ignore-address to take an IPv4
    subnet.
  * CVE-2021-3448, bsc#1183709: Use random source ports where
    possible if source addresses/interfaces in use.
  * Change the method of allocation of random source ports for DNS.
  * Scale the size of the DNS random-port pool based on the
    value of the --dns-forward-max configuration.
  * Tweak TFTP code to check sender of all received packets, as
    specified in RFC 1350 para 4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix building with lua54

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 19 12:24:02 UTC 2021 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Update to 2.83:
  * bsc#1177077: Fixed DNSpooq vulnerabilities
  * Use the values of --min-port and --max-port in outgoing
    TCP connections to upstream DNS servers.
  * Fix a remote buffer overflow problem in the DNSSEC code.
    Any dnsmasq with DNSSEC compiled in and enabled is vulnerable
    to this, referenced by CVE-2020-25681, CVE-2020-25682,
    CVE-2020-25683 CVE-2020-25687.
  * Be sure to only accept UDP DNS query replies at the address
    from which the query was originated. This keeps as much
    entropy in the {query-ID, random-port} tuple as possible, to
    help defeat cache poisoning attacks. Refer: CVE-2020-25684.
  * Use the SHA-256 hash function to verify that DNS answers
    received are for the questions originally asked. This replaces
    the slightly insecure SHA-1 (when compiled with DNSSEC) or
    the very insecure CRC32 (otherwise). Refer: CVE-2020-25685
  * Handle multiple identical near simultaneous DNS queries better.
    Previously, such queries would all be forwarded independently.
    This is, in theory, inefficent but in practise not a problem,
    _except_ that is means that an answer for any of the forwarded
    queries will be accepted and cached.
    An attacker can send a query multiple times, and for each
    repeat, another {port, ID} becomes capable of accepting the
    answer he is sending in the blind, to random IDs and ports.
    The chance of a succesful attack is therefore multiplied by the
    number of repeats of the query. The new behaviour detects
    repeated queries and merely stores the clients sending repeats
    so that when the first query completes, the answer can be sent
    to all the clients who asked. Refer: CVE-2020-25686.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 08:00:51 UTC 2020 - Martin Rey <mrey@suse.com>

- Update to 2.82:
  * Improve behaviour in the face of network interfaces which come
    and go and change index.
  * Convert hard startup failure on NETLINK_NO_ENOBUFS under
    qemu-user to a warning.
  * Allow IPv6 addresses ofthe form [::ffff:1.2.3.4] in
    --dhcp-option.
  * Fix crash under heavy TCP connection load introduced in 2.81.
  * Change default lease time for DHCPv6 to one day.
  * Alter calculation of preferred and valid times in router
    advertisements, so that these do not have a floor applied of
    the lease time in the dhcp-range if this is not explicitly
    specified and is merely the default.
- Reformat spec file with spec-cleaner

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  5 11:26:55 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 2.81:
  *	Improve cache behaviour for TCP connections
  *	Remove the NO_FORK compile-time option, and support for uclinux
  *	Fix line-counting when reading /etc/hosts and friends
  *	Fix bug in DNS non-terminal code, added in 2.80, which could
	sometimes cause a NODATA rather than an NXDOMAIN reply.
  *	Support TCP-fastopen (RFC-7413) on both incoming and
	outgoing TCP connections, if supported and enabled in the OS.
  *	Improve kernel-capability manipulation code under Linux
  *	Add --shared-network config. This enables allocation of addresses
	by the DHCP server in subnets where the server (or relay) does not
	have an interface on the network in that subnet. Many thanks to
	kamp.de for sponsoring this feature.
  *	Fix broken contrib/lease_tools/dhcp_lease_time.c. A packet
	validation check got borked in commit 2b38e382 and release 2.80.
	Thanks to Tomasz Szajner for spotting this.
  *	Fix compilation against nettle version 3.5 and later.
  *	Fix spurious DNSSEC validation failures when the auth section
	of a reply contains unsigned RRs from a signed zone,
	with the exception that NSEC and NSEC3 RRs must always be signed.
        Thanks to Tore Anderson for spotting and diagnosing the bug.
  *	Add --dhcp-ignore-clid. This disables reading of DHCP client
	identifier option (option 61), so clients are only identified by
	MAC addresses.
  *	Fix a bug which stopped --dhcp-name-match from working when a hostname
	is supplied in --dhcp-host. Thanks to James Feeney for spotting this.
  *	Fix bug which caused very rarely caused zero-length DHCPv6 packets.
	Thanks to Dereck Higgins for spotting this.
  *	Add --tftp-single-port option.
  *	Enhance --conf-dir to load files in a deterministic order
  * Add filtering by tag of --dhcp-host directives
  * Remove DSA signature verification from DNSSEC, as specified in
	RFC 8624
  *	Add --script-on-renewal option.

- Update to 2.76:

  * Include 0.0.0.0/8 in DNS rebind checks.
  * Enhance --add-subnet to allow arbitrary subnet addresses.
  * Respect the --no-resolv flag in inotify code. Fixes bug
    which caused dnsmasq to fail to start if a resolv-file
    was a dangling symbolic link, even of --no-resolv set.
  * Fix crash when an A or AAAA record is defined locally,
    in a hosts file, and an upstream server sends a reply
    that the same name is empty (CVE-2015-8899, bsc#983273).
  * Fix failure to correctly calculate cache-size when reading a
    hosts-file fails.
  * Fix wrong answer to simple name query when --domain-needed
    set, but no upstream servers configured.
  * Return REFUSED when running out of forwarding table slots,
    not SERVFAIL.
  * Add --max-port configuration.
  * Add --script-arp and two new functions for the dhcp-script.
  * Extend --add-mac to allow a new encoding of the MAC address
    as base64, by configurting --add-mac=base64
  * Add --add-cpe-id option.

  * Don't crash with divide-by-zero if an IPv6 dhcp-range is
    declared as a whole /64.
    (ie xx::0 to xx::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff)
  * Add support for a TTL parameter in --host-record and --cname.

- Update to 2.75, announce message:
    Fix reversion on 2.74 which caused 100% CPU use when a 
    dhcp-script is configured. Thanks to Adrian Davey for
    reporting the bug and testing the fix.

- Update to 2.74, announce message:
    Fix reversion in 2.73 where --conf-file would attempt to
    read the default file, rather than no file.

    Fix inotify code to handle dangling symlinks better and
    not SEGV in some circumstances.

    DNSSEC fix. In the case of a signed CNAME generated by a
    wildcard which pointed to an unsigned domain, the wrong
    status would be logged, and some necessary checks omitted.

- Update to 2.73, announce message:
    Fix crash at startup when an empty suffix is supplied to
    --conf-dir, also trivial memory leak. Thanks to
    Tomas Hozza for spotting this.

    Remove floor of 4096 on advertised EDNS0 packet size when
    DNSSEC in use, the original rationale for this has long gone.
    Thanks to Anders Kaseorg for spotting this.

    Use inotify for checking on updates to /etc/resolv.conf and
    friends under Linux. This fixes race conditions when the files are
    updated rapidly and saves CPU by noy polling. To build
    a binary that runs on old Linux kernels without inotify,
    use make COPTS=-DNO_INOTIFY

    Fix breakage of --domain=<domain>,<subnet>,local - only reverse
    queries were intercepted. THis appears to have been broken
    since 2.69. Thanks to Josh Stone for finding the bug.

    Eliminate IPv6 privacy addresses and deprecated addresses from
    the answers given by --interface-name. Note that reverse queries
    (ie looking for names, given addresses) are not affected.
    Thanks to Michael Gorbach for the suggestion.

    Fix crash in DNSSEC code with long RRs. Thanks to Marco Davids
    for the bug report.

    Add --ignore-address option. Ignore replies to A-record
    queries which include the specified address. No error is
    generated, dnsmasq simply continues to listen for another
    reply. This is useful to defeat blocking strategies which
    rely on quickly supplying a forged answer to a DNS
    request for certain domains, before the correct answer can
    arrive. Thanks to Glen Huang for the patch.

    Revisit the part of DNSSEC validation which determines if an
    unsigned answer is legit, or is in some part of the DNS
    tree which should be signed. Dnsmasq now works from the
    DNS root downward looking for the limit of signed
    delegations, rather than working bottom up. This is
    both more correct, and less likely to trip over broken
    nameservers in the unsigned parts of the DNS tree
    which don't respond well to DNSSEC queries.

    Add --log-queries=extra option, which makes logs easier
    to search automatically.

    Add --min-cache-ttl option. I've resisted this for a long
    time, on the grounds that disbelieving TTLs is never a
    good idea, but I've been persuaded that there are
    sometimes reasons to do it. (Step forward, GFW).
    To avoid misuse, there's a hard limit on the TTL
    floor of one hour. Thansk to RinSatsuki for the patch.

    Cope with multiple interfaces with the same link-local
    address. (IPv6 addresses are scoped, so this is allowed.)
    Thanks to Cory Benfield for help with this.

    Add --dhcp-hostsdir. This allows addition of new host
    configurations to a running dnsmasq instance much more
    cheaply than having dnsmasq re-read all its existing
    configuration each time.

    Don't reply to DHCPv6 SOLICIT messages if we're not
    configured to do stateful DHCPv6. Thanks to Win King Wan
    for the patch.

    Fix broken DNSSEC validation of ECDSA signatures.

    Add --dnssec-timestamp option, which provides an automatic
    way to detect when the system time becomes valid after
    boot on systems without an RTC, whilst allowing DNS
    queries before the clock is valid so that NTP can run.
    Thanks to Kevin Darbyshire-Bryant for developing this idea.

    Add --tftp-no-fail option. Thanks to Stefan Tomanek for
    the patch.

    Fix crash caused by looking up servers.bind, CHAOS text
    record, when more than about five --servers= lines are
    in the dnsmasq config. This causes memory corruption
    which causes a crash later. Thanks to Matt Coddington for
    sterling work chasing this down.

    Fix crash on receipt of certain malformed DNS requests.
    Thanks to Nick Sampanis for spotting the problem.
    Note that this is could allow the dnsmasq process's
    memory to be read by an attacker under certain
    circumstances, so it has a CVE, CVE-2015-3294

    Fix crash in authoritative DNS code, if a .arpa zone
    is declared as authoritative, and then a PTR query which
    is not to be treated as authoritative arrived. Normally,
    directly declaring .arpa zone as authoritative is not
    done, so this crash wouldn't be seen. Instead the
    relevant .arpa zone should be specified as a subnet
    in the auth-zone declaration. Thanks to Johnny S. Lee
    for the bugreport and initial patch.

    Fix authoritative DNS code to correctly reply to NS
    and SOA queries for .arpa zones for which we are
    declared authoritative by means of a subnet in auth-zone.
    Previously we provided correct answers to PTR queries
    in such zones (including NS and SOA) but not direct
    NS and SOA queries. Thanks to Johnny S. Lee for
     pointing out the problem.

    Fix logging of DHCPREPLY which should be suppressed
    by quiet-dhcp6. Thanks to J. Pablo Abonia for
    spotting the problem.

    Try and handle net connections with broken fragmentation
    that lose large UDP packets. If a server times out,
    reduce the maximum UDP packet size field in the EDNS0
    header to 1280 bytes. If it then answers, make that
    change permanent.

    Check IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses when --stop-rebind
    is active. Thanks to Jordan Milne for spotting this.

    Allow DHCPv4 options T1 and T2 to be set using --dhcp-option.
    Thanks to Kevin Benton for patches and work on this.

    Fix code for DHCPCONFIRM DHCPv6 messages to confirm addresses
    in the correct subnet, even of not in dynamic address
    allocation range. Thanks to Steve Hirsch for spotting
    the problem.

    Add AddDhcpLease and DeleteDhcpLease DBus methods. Thanks
    to Nicolas Cavallari for the patch.

    Allow configuration of router advertisements without the
    "on-link" bit set. Thanks to Neil Jerram for the patch.

    Extend --bridge-interface to DHCPv6 and router
    advertisements. Thanks to Neil Jerram for the patch.

    Add support for "ipsets" in *BSD, using pf. Thanks to
    Sven Falempim for the patch.

    Add DBus methods SetFilterWin2KOption and SetBogusPrivOption
    Thanks to the Smoothwall project for the patch.

    Fix failure to build against Nettle-3.0. Thanks to Steven

    When assigning existing DHCP leases to intefaces by comparing
    networks, handle the case that two or more interfaces have the
    same network part, but different prefix lengths (favour the
    longer prefix length.) Thanks to Lung-Pin Chang for the
    patch.

    Add a mode which detects and removes DNS forwarding loops, ie
    a query sent to an upstream server returns as a new query to
    dnsmasq, and would therefore be forwarded again, resulting in
    a query which loops many times before being dropped. Upstream
    servers which loop back are disabled and this event is logged.
    Thanks to Smoothwall for their sponsorship of this feature.

    Extend --conf-dir to allow filtering of files. So
    --conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d,\*.conf
    will load all the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d which end in .conf

    Fix bug when resulted in NXDOMAIN answers instead of NODATA in
    some circumstances.

    Fix bug which caused dnsmasq to become unresponsive if it
    failed to send packets due to a network interface disappearing.
    Thanks to Niels Peen for spotting this.

- update to 2.71:
    Subtle change to error handling to help DNSSEC validation 
    when servers fail to provide NODATA answers for 
    non-existent DS records.

    Tweak code which removes DNSSEC records from answers when
    not required. Fixes broken answers when additional section
    has real records in it. Thanks to Marco Davids for the bug 
    report.

    Fix DNSSEC validation of ANY queries. Thanks to Marco Davids
    for spotting that too.

    Fix total DNS failure and 100% CPU use if cachesize set to zero,
    regression introduced in 2.69. Thanks to James Hunt and
    the Ubuntu crowd for assistance in fixing this.


    Fix crash, introduced in 2.69, on TCP request when dnsmasq
    compiled with DNSSEC support, but running without DNSSEC
    enabled. Thanks to Manish Sing for spotting that one.

    Fix regression which broke ipset functionality. Thanks to 
    Wang Jian for the bug report.


    Implement dynamic interface discovery on *BSD. This allows
    the contructor: syntax to be used in dhcp-range for DHCPv6
    on the BSD platform. Thanks to Matthias Andree for
    valuable research on how to implement this.

    Fix infinite loop associated with some --bogus-nxdomain
    configs. Thanks fogobogo for the bug report.

    Fix missing RA RDNS option with configuration like
    --dhcp-option=option6:23,[::] Thanks to Tsachi Kimeldorfer
    for spotting the problem.

    Add [fd00::] and [fe80::] as special addresses in DHCPv6
    options, analogous to [::]. [fd00::] is replaced with the
    actual ULA of the interface on the machine running
    dnsmasq, [fe80::] with the link-local address. 
    Thanks to Tsachi Kimeldorfer for championing this.

    DNSSEC validation and caching. Dnsmasq needs to be
    compiled with this enabled, with 
    
    make dnsmasq COPTS=-DHAVE_DNSSEC
    
    this add dependencies on the nettle crypto library and the 
    gmp maths library. It's possible to have these linked
    statically with
    
    make dnsmasq COPTS='-DHAVE_DNSSEC -DHAVE_DNSSEC_STATIC'
    
    which bloats the dnsmasq binary, but saves the size of 
    the shared libraries which are much bigger.

    To enable, DNSSEC, you will need a set of
    trust-anchors. Now that the TLDs are signed, this can be
    the keys for the root zone, and for convenience they are
    included in trust-anchors.conf in the dnsmasq
    distribution. You should of course check that these are
    legitimate and up-to-date. So, adding
    
    conf-file=/path/to/trust-anchors.conf
    dnssec

    to your config is all thats needed to get things
    working. The upstream nameservers have to be DNSSEC-capable
    too, of course. Many ISP nameservers aren't, but the
    Google public nameservers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) are.
    When DNSSEC is configured, dnsmasq validates any queries 
    for domains which are signed. Query results which are 
    bogus are replaced with SERVFAIL replies, and results 
    which are correctly signed have the AD bit set. In 
    addition, and just as importantly, dnsmasq supplies 
    correct DNSSEC information to clients which are doing 
    their own validation, and caches DNSKEY, DS and RRSIG
    records, which significantly improve the performance of 
    downstream validators. Setting --log-queries will show 
    DNSSEC in action.

    If a domain is returned from an upstream nameserver without 
    DNSSEC signature, dnsmasq by default trusts this. This 
    means that for unsigned zone (still the majority) there 
    is effectively no cost for having DNSSEC enabled. Of course
    this allows an attacker to replace a signed record with a 
    false unsigned record. This is addressed by the 
    --dnssec-check-unsigned flag, which instructs dnsmasq
    to prove that an unsigned record is legitimate, by finding  
    a secure proof that the zone containing the record is not
    signed. Doing this has costs (typically one or two extra
    upstream queries). It also has a nasty failure mode if
    dnsmasq's upstream nameservers are not DNSSEC capable. 
    Without --dnssec-check-unsigned using such an upstream
    server will simply result in not queries being validated; 
    with --dnssec-check-unsigned enabled and a 
    DNSSEC-ignorant upstream server, _all_ queries will fail.

    Note that DNSSEC requires that the local time is valid and 
    accurate, if not then DNSSEC validation will fail. NTP 
    should be running. This presents a problem for routers
    without a battery-backed clock. To set the time needs NTP 
    to do DNS lookups, but lookups will fail until NTP has run.
    To address this, there's a flag, --dnssec-no-timecheck 
    which disables the time checks (only) in DNSSEC. When dnsmasq
    is started and the clock is not synced, this flag should
    be used. As soon as the clock is synced, SIGHUP dnsmasq. 
    The SIGHUP clears the cache of partially-validated data and
    resets the no-timecheck flag, so that all DNSSEC checks 
    henceforward will be complete.
    
    The development of DNSSEC in dnsmasq was started by 
    Giovanni Bajo, to whom huge thanks are owed. It has been
    supported by Comcast, whose techfund grant has allowed for 
    an invaluable period of full-time work to get it to 
    a workable state.

    Add --rev-server. Thanks to Dave Taht for suggesting this.
    
    Add --servers-file. Allows dynamic update of upstream servers 
    full access to configuration. 

    Add --local-service. Accept DNS queries only from hosts 
    whose address is on a local subnet, ie a subnet for which 
    an interface exists on the server. This option
    only has effect if there are no --interface --except-interface,
    --listen-address or --auth-server options. It is intended 
    to be set as a default on installation, to allow
    unconfigured installations to be useful but also safe from 
    being used for DNS amplification attacks.

    Fix crashes in cache_get_cname_target() when dangling CNAMEs
    encountered. Thanks to Andy and the rt-n56u project for
    find this and helping to chase it down.

    Fix wrong RCODE in authoritative DNS replies to PTR queries. The
    correct answer was included, but the RCODE was set to NXDOMAIN.
    Thanks to Craig McQueen for spotting this.

    Make statistics available as DNS queries in the .bind TLD as 
    well as logging them.


    Use random addresses for DHCPv6 temporary address
    allocations, instead of algorithmically determined stable
    addresses.

    Fix bug which meant that the DHCPv6 DUID was not available
    in DHCP script runs during the lifetime of the dnsmasq
    process which created the DUID de-novo. Once the DUID was
    created and stored in the lease file and dnsmasq
    restarted, this bug disappeared.

    Fix bug introduced in 2.67 which could result in erroneous
    NXDOMAIN returns to CNAME queries.

    Fix build failures on MacOS X and openBSD.

    Allow subnet specifications in --auth-zone to be interface 
    names as well as address literals. This makes it possible
    to configure authoritative DNS when local address ranges
    are dynamic and works much better than the previous
    work-around which exempted contructed DHCP ranges from the
    IP address filtering. As a consequence, that work-around
    is removed. Under certain circumstances, this change wil
    break existing configuration: if you're relying on the
    contructed-range exception, you need to change --auth-zone
    to specify the same interface as is used to construct your
    DHCP ranges, probably with a trailing "/6" like this: 
    --auth-zone=example.com,eth0/6 to limit the addresses to
    IPv6 addresses of eth0.

    Fix problems when advertising deleted IPv6 prefixes. If
    the prefix is deleted (rather than replaced), it doesn't
    get advertised with zero preferred time. Thanks to Tsachi
    for the bug report. 

    Fix segfault with some locally configured CNAMEs. Thanks
    to Andrew Childs for spotting the problem.

    Fix memory leak on re-reading /etc/hosts and friends,
    introduced in 2.67.

    Check the arrival interface of incoming DNS and TFTP
    requests via IPv6, even in --bind-interfaces mode. This
    isn't possible for IPv4 and can generate scary warnings,
    but as it's always possible for IPv6 (the API always
    exists) then we should do it always. 
    
    Tweak the rules on prefix-lengths in --dhcp-range for
    IPv6. The new rule is that the specified prefix length
    must be larger than or equal to the prefix length of the
    corresponding address on the local interface. 


    Fix crash if upstream server returns SERVFAIL when
    --conntrack in use. Thanks to Giacomo Tazzari for finding
    this and supplying the patch. 

    Repair regression in 2.64. That release stopped sending
    lease-time information in the reply to DHCPINFORM
    requests, on the correct grounds that it was a standards
    violation. However, this broke the dnsmasq-specific
    dhcp_lease_time utility. Now, DHCPINFORM returns
    lease-time only if it's specifically requested
    (maintaining standards) and the dhcp_lease_time utility
    has been taught to ask for it (restoring functionality). 

    Fix --dhcp-match, --dhcp-vendorclass and --dhcp-userclass
    to work with BOOTP and well as DHCP. Thanks to Peter
    Korsgaard for spotting the problem. 

    Add --synth-domain. Thanks to Vishvananda Ishaya for
    suggesting this.

    Fix failure to compile ipset.c if old kernel headers are
    in use. Thanks to Eugene Rudoy for pointing this out.

    Handle IPv4 interface-address labels in Linux. These are
    often used to emulate the old IP-alias addresses. Before,
    using --interface=eth0 would service all the addresses of
    eth0, including ones configured as aliases, which appear
    in ifconfig as eth0:0. Now, only addresses with the label
    eth0 are active. This is not backwards compatible: if you
    want to continue to bind the aliases too, you need to add
    eg. --interface=eth0:0 to the config. 

    Fix "failed to set SO_BINDTODEVICE on DHCP socket: Socket 
    operation on non-socket" error on startup with
    configurations which have exactly one --interface option
    and do RA but _not_ DHCPv6. Thanks to Trever Adams for the
    bug report.

    Generalise --interface-name to cope with IPv6 addresses
    and multiple addresses per interface per address family.

    Fix option parsing for --dhcp-host, which was generating a
    spurious error when all seven possible items were
    included. Thanks to Zhiqiang Wang for the bug report.

    Remove restriction on prefix-length in --auth-zone. Thanks
    to Toke Hoiland-Jorgensen for suggesting this.

    Log when the maximum number of concurrent DNS queries is
    reached. Thanks to Marcelo Salhab Brogliato for the patch.

    If wildcards are used in --interface, don't assume that 
    there will only ever be one available interface for DHCP
    just because there is one at start-up. More may appear, so
    we can't use SO_BINDTODEVICE. Thanks to Natrio for the bug
    report. 

    Increase timeout/number of retries in TFTP to accomodate
    AudioCodes Voice Gateways doing streaming writes to flash.
    Thanks to Damian Kaczkowski for spotting the problem.

    Fix crash with empty DHCP string options when adding zero
    terminator. Thanks to Patrick McLean for the bug report.

    Allow hostnames to start with a number, as allowed in
    RFC-1123. Thanks to Kyle Mestery for the patch. 

    Fixes to DHCP FQDN option handling: don't terminate FQDN
    if domain not known and allow a FQDN option with blank
    name to request that a FQDN option is returned in the
    reply. Thanks to Roy Marples for the patch.

    Make --clear-on-reload apply to setting upstream servers
    via DBus too.

    When the address which triggered the construction of an
    advertised IPv6 prefix disappears, continue to advertise 
    the prefix for up to 2 hours, with the preferred lifetime
    set to zero. This satisfies RFC 6204 4.3 L-13 and makes
    things work better if a prefix disappears without being
    deprecated first. Thanks to Uwe Schindler for persuasively
    arguing for this.

    Fix MAC address enumeration on *BSD. Thanks to Brad Smith
    for the bug report.

    Support RFC-4242 information-refresh-time options in the 
    reply to DHCPv6 information-request. The lease time of the
    smallest valid dhcp-range is sent. Thanks to Uwe Schindler 
    for suggesting this.

    Make --listen-address higher priority than --except-interface
    in all circumstances. Thanks to Thomas Hood for the bugreport.

    Provide independent control over which interfaces get TFTP 
    service. If enable-tftp is given a list of interfaces, then TFTP 
    is provided on those. Without the list, the previous behaviour
    (provide TFTP to the same interfaces we provide DHCP to) 
    is retained. Thanks to Lonnie Abelbeck for the suggestion.

    Add --dhcp-relay config option. Many thanks to vtsl.net
    for sponsoring this development.

    Fix crash with empty tag: in --dhcp-range. Thanks to
    Kaspar Schleiser for the bug report.

    Add "baseline" and "bloatcheck" makefile targets, for 
    revealing size changes during development. Thanks to
    Vladislav Grishenko for the patch. 

    Cope with DHCPv6 clients which send REQUESTs without
    address options - treat them as SOLICIT with rapid commit.

    Support identification of clients by MAC address in
    DHCPv6. When using a relay, the relay must support RFC
    6939 for this to work. It always works for directly
    connected clients. Thanks to Vladislav Grishenko
    for prompting this feature.
    
    Remove the rule for constructed DHCP ranges that the local
    address must be either the first or last address in the
    range. This was originally to avoid SLAAC addresses, but
    we now explicitly autoconfig and privacy addresses instead.  

    Update Polish translation. Thanks to Jan Psota.

    Fix problem in DHCPv6 vendorclass/userclass matching
    code. Thanks to Tanguy Bouzeloc for the patch.

    Update Spanish transalation. Thanks to Vicente Soriano.

    Add --ra-param option. Thanks to Vladislav Grishenko for
    inspiration on this.

    Add --add-subnet configuration, to tell upstream DNS
    servers where the original client is. Thanks to DNSthingy
    for sponsoring this feature.

    Add --quiet-dhcp, --quiet-dhcp6 and --quiet-ra. Thanks to
    Kevin Darbyshire-Bryant for the initial patch.

    Allow A/AAAA records created by --interface-name to be the
    target of --cname. Thanks to Hadmut Danisch for the
    suggestion. 

    Avoid treating a --dhcp-host which has an IPv6 address
    as eligable for use with DHCPv4 on the grounds that it has
    no address, and vice-versa. Thanks to Yury Konovalov for
    spotting the problem.

    Do a better job caching dangling CNAMEs. Thanks to Yves
    Dorfsman for spotting the problem.


    Add the ability to act as an authoritative DNS
    server. Dnsmasq can now answer queries from the wider 'net
    with local data, as long as the correct NS records are set
    up. Only local data is provided, to avoid creating an open
    DNS relay. Zone transfer is supported, to allow secondary
    servers to be configured.

    Add "constructed DHCP ranges" for DHCPv6. This is intended
    for IPv6 routers which get prefixes dynamically via prefix
    delegation. With suitable configuration, stateful DHCPv6
    and RA can happen automatically as prefixes are delegated
    and then deprecated, without having  to re-write the
    dnsmasq configuration file or restart the daemon. Thanks to
    Steven Barth for extensive testing and development work on
    this idea.

    Fix crash on startup on Solaris 11. Regression probably
    introduced in 2.61.  Thanks to Geoff Johnstone for the
    patch.

    Add code to make behaviour for TCP DNS requests that same
    as for UDP requests, when a request arrives for an allowed 
    address, but via a banned interface. This change is only
    active on Linux, since the relevant API is missing (AFAIK)
    on other platforms. Many thanks to Tomas Hozza for
    spotting the problem, and doing invaluable discovery of
    the obscure and undocumented API required for the solution.

    Don't send the default DHCP option advertising dnsmasq as
    the local DNS server if dnsmasq is configured to not act
    as DNS server, or it's configured to a non-standard port.

    Add DNSMASQ_CIRCUIT_ID, DNSMASQ_SUBCRIBER_ID,
    DNSMASQ_REMOTE_ID variables to the environment of the
    lease-change script (and the corresponding Lua). These hold
    information inserted into the DHCP request by a DHCP relay
    agent. Thanks to Lakefield Communications for providing a
    bounty for this addition.

    Fixed crash, introduced in 2.64, whilst handling DHCPv6
    information-requests with some common configurations.
    Thanks to Robert M. Albrecht for the bug report and 
    chasing the problem.

    Add --ipset option. Thanks to Jason A. Donenfeld for the 
    patch.

    Don't erroneously reject some option names in --dhcp-match
    options. Thanks to Benedikt Hochstrasser for the bug report.
    
    Allow a trailing '*' wildcard in all interface-name
    configurations. Thanks to Christian Parpart for the patch.

    Handle the situation where libc headers define
    SO_REUSEPORT, but the kernel in use doesn't, to cope with
    the introduction of this option to Linux. Thanks to Rich
    Felker for the bug report.

    Update Polish translation. Thanks to Jan Psota.

    Fix crash if the configured DHCP lease limit is
    reached. Regression occurred in 2.61. Thanks to Tsachi for
    the bug report. 
    
    Update the French translation. Thanks to Gildas le Nadan.

- license update: GPL-2.0
  Most of the source code files give a choice of either GPL-2.0 or GPL-3.0
  (not GPL-2.0+). The website states that the COPYING file in the
  distribution is the official license - in this case it is GPL-2.0. This
  is consistent with what Fedora state about the package. Accordingly, I^d
  be ok with License: GPL-2.0 or License: (GPL-2.0 or GPL-3.0) but not
  License: GPL-2.0+

- fix the small cache size problem in a different way by tweaking
  the build config instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 23 03:53:32 UTC 2012 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- The default cache size is way too small (150 entries) use a sane
  default of 2000 as used in *WRT embeeded routers which is still
  very conservative for a desktop/server machine.
- use async logging

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 29 19:16:43 UTC 2012 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 2.61:
  * add ra-names, ra-stateless and slaac keywords for DHCPv6: dnsmasq can now
    synthesise AAAA records for dual-stack hosts which get IPv6 addresses via
    SLAAC; it is also now possible to use SLAAC and stateless DHCPv6, and to
    tell clients to use SLAAC addresses as well as DHCP ones
  * add --dhcp-duid to allow DUID-EN uids to be used
  * explicity send DHCPv6 replies to the correct port, instead of relying on
    clients to send requests with the correct source address, since at least
    one client in the wild gets this wrong
  * send a preference value of 255 in DHCPv6 replies when --dhcp-authoritative
    is in effect: his tells clients not to wait around for other DHCP servers
  * better logging of DHCPv6 options
  * add --host-record
  * invoke the DHCP script with action "tftp" when a TFTP file transfer
    completes: the size of the file, address to which it was sent and complete
    pathname are supplied; note that version 2.60 introduced some script
    incompatibilties associated with DHCPv6, and this is a further change; to
    be safe, scripts should ignore unknown actions, and if not IPv6-aware,
    should exit if the environment variable DNSMASQ_IAID is set; the use-case
    for this is to track netboot/install
  * update contrib/port-forward/dnsmasq-portforward to reflect the above
  * set the environment variable DNSMASQ_LOG_DHCP when running the script id
    --log-dhcp is in effect, so that script can taylor their logging verbosity
  * arrange that addresses specified with --listen-address work even if there
    is no interface carrying the address; this is chiefly useful for IPv4
    loopback addresses, where any address in 127.0.0.0/8 is a valid loopback
    address, but normally only 127.0.0.1 appears on the lo interface
  * fix crash, introduced in 2.60, when a DHCPINFORM is received from a network
    which has no valid dhcp-range
  * add a new DHCP lease time keyword, "deprecated" for --dhcp-range: this is
    only valid for IPv6, and sets the preffered lease time for both DHCP and RA
    to zero; the effect is that clients can continue to use the address for
    existing connections, but new connections will use other addresses, if they
    exist; this makes hitless renumbering at least possible
  * fix bug in address6_available() which caused DHCPv6 lease aquistion to fail
    if more than one dhcp-range in use
  * provide RDNSS and DNSSL data in router advertisements, using the settings
    provided for DHCP options option6:domain-search and option6:dns-server
  * don't cache data from non-recursive nameservers, since it may erroneously
    look like a valid CNAME to a non-exitant name
  * call SO_BINDTODEVICE on the DHCP socket(s) when doing DHCP on exacly one
    interface and --bind-interfaces is set; this makes the OpenStack use-case
    of one dnsmasq per virtual interface work
  * give correct from-cache answers to explict CNAME queries
  * add --tftp-lowercase option
  * ensure that the DBus DhcpLeaseUpdated events are generated when a lease
    goes through INIT_REBOOT state, even if the dhcp-script is not in use

  hooks for tracking DHCP leases. 

* 2.52

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 16:07:32 CET 2009 - ug@suse.de

* Add support for internationalised DNS.

* Add two more environment variables for lease-change scripts:
  First, DNSMASQ_SUPPLIED_HOSTNAME; this is set to the hostname
  supplied by a client, even if the actual hostname used is
  over-ridden by dhcp-host or dhcp-ignore-names directives.
  Also DNSMASQ_RELAY_ADDRESS which gives the address of 
  a DHCP relay, if used.

* Fix regression which broke echo of relay-agent
  options. Thanks to Michael Rack for spotting this.

* Don't treat option 67 as being interchangeable with
  dhcp-boot parameters if it's specified as
  dhcp-option-force.

* Make the code to call scripts on lease-change compile-time
  optional. It can be switched off by editing src/config.h
  or building with "make COPTS=-DNO_SCRIPT".

* Make the TFTP server cope with filenames from Windows/DOS
  which use '\' as pathname separator. Thanks to Ralf for
  the patch.

* Warn if an IP address is duplicated in /etc/ethers.

* Teach --conf-dir to take an option list of file suffices
  which will be ignored when scanning the directory. Useful
  for backup files etc. Thanks to Helmut Hullen for the
  suggestion. 

* Add new DHCP option named tftpserver-address

* Don't do any PXE processing, even for clients with the 
  correct vendorclass, unless at least one pxe-prompt or 
  pxe-service option is given.

* Limit the blocksize used for TFTP transfers to a value
  which avoids packet fragmentation, based on the MTU of the
  local interface. Many netboot ROMs can't cope with
  fragmented packets.

* Honour dhcp-ignore configuration for PXE and proxy-PXE 
  requests.

* 2.51

  upstream nameservers and replaces the C library PRNG with stronger code. It
  makes failure to drop root privileges a hard error (previous versions would
  log the error and continue, running as root.) Other changes include an
  update to avoid triggering Linux kernel messages about an out-of-date
  capabilities ABI, support for NAPTR records, and RFC 5107
  server-id-override.

Tue Feb 13 09:33:37 CET 2007 - ug@suse.de

- version 2.38

 Don't send length zero DHCP option 43 and cope with
 encapsulated options whose total length exceeds 255 octets
 by splitting them into multiple option 43 pieces.

 Avoid queries being retried forever when --strict-order is
 set and an upstream server returns a SERVFAIL
 error. Thanks to Johannes Stezenbach for spotting this.

 Fix BOOTP support, broken in version 2.37.

 Add example dhcp-options for Etherboot.

 Add \e (for ASCII ESCape) to the set of valid escapes
 in config-file strings.

 Added --dhcp-option-force flag and examples in the
 configuration file which use this to control PXELinux.

 Added --tftp-no-blocksize option.

 Set netid tag "bootp" when BOOTP (rather than DHCP) is in
 use. This makes it easy to customise which options are
 sent to BOOTP clients. (BOOTP allows only 64 octets for
 options, so it can be necessary to trim things.)

 Fix rare hang in cache code, a 2.37 regression. This
 probably needs an infinite DHCP lease and some bad luck to
 trigger. Thanks to Detlef Reichelt for bug reports and
 testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 16:29:39 CET 2007 - ug@suse.de

 Add better support for RFC-2855 DHCP-over-firewire and RFC
-4390 DHCP-over-InfiniBand. A good suggestion from Karl Svec.

 Some efficiency tweaks to the cache code for very large
 /etc/hosts files. Should improve reverse (address->name)
 lookups and garbage collection. Thanks to Jan 'RedBully'
 Seiffert for input on this.

 Fix regression in 2.36 which made bogus-nxdomain
 and DNS caching unreliable. Thanks to Dennis DeDonatis
 and Jan Seiffert for bug reports.

 Make DHCP encapsulated vendor-class options sane. Be
 warned that some conceivable existing configurations
 using these may break, but they work in a much
 simpler and more logical way now. Prepending
 "vendor:<client-id>" to an option encapsulates it
 in option 43, and the option is sent only if the
 client-supplied vendor-class substring-matches with
 the given client-id. Thanks to Dennis DeDonatis for
 help with this.

 Apply patch from Jan Seiffert to tidy up tftp.c

 Add support for overloading the filename and servername
 fields in DHCP packet. This gives extra option-space when
 these fields are not being used or with a modern client
 which supports moving them into options.
