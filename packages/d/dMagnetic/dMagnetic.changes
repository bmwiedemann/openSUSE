  This is a code cleanup release. It includes lots of bug fixes. For example:
  A picture from 'Fish!' was missing. What a shame. In addtion to this, I also
  took the liberty of cleaning up the website a little bit. Hope you like it.
- Update to 0.29
  Welcome to the "Night before Christmas" Release of dMagnetic! This one allows
  players to use ATR images from the AtariXL and Atari800 releases of the games.
  In addtition to this, a new graphics vmode has been added: UTF. It works on
  more terminals than the sixel mode and allows more people to enjoy the
  beautiful pictures!
