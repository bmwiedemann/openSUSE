  <title>Disposable Soft Synth Interface</title>
  <description>Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI, pronounced &quot;dizzy&quot;) is a
proposal for a plug-in API for software instruments (soft synths) with
user interfaces, permitting them to be hosted in-process by Linux audio
applications. Think of it as LADSPA-for-instruments or something
comparable to a simpler version of VSTi.</description>
