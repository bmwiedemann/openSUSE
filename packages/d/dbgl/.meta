  <title>DOSBox Game Launcher</title>
  <description>DBGL is a Java front-end for DOSBox, based largely upon the proven
interface of D-Fend.
The front-end is by no means finished. It is a work in progress
and lacking many features, but the core is working, and I think
the product is somewhat usable as it is. Please bear in mind that
the interface is still quite rough around the edges.
