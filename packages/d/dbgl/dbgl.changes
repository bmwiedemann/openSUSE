- Update to version 0.92
  * Added a first implementation of 'directory scanning for known
    games'. Currently, all files/games from the D-Fend Reloaded
    'Auto setup templates' are recognized.
  * DBGL can now query MobyGames meta-data using a local database
    from 'Metropolis Launcher', very quickly. Note that cover-art
    and screenshots are still being fetched from www.mobygames.com,
    though.
  * Added support for the DOSBox SVN OpenGL shader patch from
    ny00123 & jmarsh.
  * You may now browse through the various captured images using
    the left and right arrow keys, or the buttons below the image.
  * Various fixes related to MobyGames querying, especially in
    relation to (.gif) image data.
  * Fixed "Start profile manually with a specific DOSBox version"
    creating an incomplete .conf file.
  * Fixed possible issues when using symbolic links on Linux.
  * Also fixed a rare file path mangling issue.
  * A few usability improvements, refactored more parts of the
    GUI code, updated translations.
  * Updated all libraries, most importantly HSQLDB (from 1.8.1 to
    2.5.0).
