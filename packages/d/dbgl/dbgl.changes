- Update to version 0.99:
  * Implemented support for special DOSBox 'families' such as
    DOSBox-X, Staging, ECE and SVN. Please note that you'll have to
    select the correct family and version when configuring a
    'DOSBox Version' in DBGL. For DOSBox-X, make sure to use the
    dosbox-x.reference.full.conf configuration file, or some
    options might remain disabled in DBGL.
  * It's recommend to disable any existing DOSBox version-specific
    options (as shown here), to make full use of the new features
    for the newly supported DOSBox families/versions, see this.
  * Rewrote the template/profile editor, now having the settings
    categories on the left side in a tree structure, allowing for
    many more configuration options. When hovering over a
    configuration item, a small tooltip will show the DOSBox
    configuration [section] & item associated with it.
  * Added support for importing/converting eXoDOS V6r4, the new
    Media Pack and eXoDemoScene.
  * Fixed a possible crash when trying to export the profile list,
    plus an issue that could lead to duplicate templates and DOSBox
    versions (Neville).
  * Fixed an issue where, when editing a profile and changing the
    associated DOSBox Version, the association would 'stick' after
    cancelling (in memory, not on disk).
  * Spanish and German translation update by Neville and Marcel,
    respectively.
  * implemented a small tool to renumber all database object IDs,
    see this (ElTipejoLoco and others).
  * Updated multiple Java libraries, most importantly SWT (dropping
    support for Windows versions older than Win7 for the moment)

- Update to version 0.98:
  * Added support for eXoDOS V6 and V6r2. While both the convertor
    and importer have been improved, using the importer has
    advantages; it has the ability to import the custom DOSBox
    versions that come with eXoDOS, creates filter tabs for
    Playlists and can import the Media Pack Add-On and soundfonts.
    More details can be found in section Game collection management
  * Added support for the IBM Music Feature Card, in the profile
    editor.
  * Slovakian translation update.
  * Implemented a workaround for strange zipfile check which
    prevented certain GamePackArchives from being imported on
    modern Java versions.
  * Implemented another workaround for SWT bug resulting in broken
    artwork on Linux.
  * Allow parent directories to be considered relative, if
    configured as such.
  * Display image dimensions in thumb dialog title.
  * Fixed a few crash bugs: when DOSBox dynamic options are somehow
    invalid (red_avatar), when editing an imgmount with fstype=none
    or when creating a filter with a very lengthy condition.
  * Updated multiple Java libraries, most importantly SWT which now
    requires Java 17.

- Update to version 0.92
  * Added a first implementation of 'directory scanning for known
    games'. Currently, all files/games from the D-Fend Reloaded
    'Auto setup templates' are recognized.
  * DBGL can now query MobyGames meta-data using a local database
    from 'Metropolis Launcher', very quickly. Note that cover-art
    and screenshots are still being fetched from www.mobygames.com,
    though.
  * Added support for the DOSBox SVN OpenGL shader patch from
    ny00123 & jmarsh.
  * You may now browse through the various captured images using
    the left and right arrow keys, or the buttons below the image.
  * Various fixes related to MobyGames querying, especially in
    relation to (.gif) image data.
  * Fixed "Start profile manually with a specific DOSBox version"
    creating an incomplete .conf file.
  * Fixed possible issues when using symbolic links on Linux.
  * Also fixed a rare file path mangling issue.
  * A few usability improvements, refactored more parts of the
    GUI code, updated translations.
  * Updated all libraries, most importantly HSQLDB (from 1.8.1 to
    2.5.0).
