Fri Feb  6 23:49:19 UTC 2026 - Shawn Dunn <sfalken@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.2.5
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixes FTBFS on aarch64
  * Changes
    - Updates related to detecting and reporting display connection
      and disconnection
- 2.2.3 -> 2.2.4
  * Bugfixes
    - Display selection has been reworked to be more flexible,
      while also simpler internally
    - "eDP" is once again an (almost) absolute indicator or a
      laptop display which can be excluded from further processing.
      To handle the error case where "eDP" is in the name for an
      external display, option --edp-ambiguous has been added
    - Segfault in the capabilities command when parsing a malformed
      capabilities string returned by a monitor.
    - Very slow response when the EDID is obtained from /sys but is
      not readable using I2C.
  * Changes
    - Option --edid. If the value given starts with "...", the
      remainder of the value is some number of hex digits.
    - Added option --ignore-bus. Specifies the number of a /dev/i2c
      bus that should be completely ignored, providing a workaround
      for obscure bugs.
- 2.2.1 -> 2.2.3
  * Bugfixes
    - Starting with release 2.2.0, verification on command setvcp
      and API functions that set a feature value did not not occur,
      even if option --verify was explicitly given. As a result of
      this fix, scripts and applications that hitherto appeared to
      succeed when setting a feature value many now fail the
      operation because of verification.
    - Command getvcp --verbose: output was partially in a format
      intended for syslog.
    - Fix permission denied errors and incorrectly formed path name
      for examining /sys/class/drm with environment --verbose
    - Fix out-of-tree build reference to generated file
      /src/base/build_details.h (gh#rockowitz/ddcutil#544)
    - Fix FTBFS when --disable-drm set
    - configure option --disable-drm forces --disable-watch-displays
  * Changes
    - Relax the check of the device class when determining if a
      device is a video controller (gh#rockowitz/ddcutil#530)
    - Additional messages reporting configuration file errors
    - If possible, obtain the list of PNP ids from
      /usr/share/hwdata/pnp.ids instead of using a hardcoded list.
      Affects output of command detect.
    - Reword the parser explanation of options --verify and
      --noverify for clarity.

Tue Jul 15 07:02:40 UTC 2025 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 2.2.1:
  * Added
    - Do not perform permission checks if running with effective
      user root, i.e. when running with setuid bit set.
      Partially addresses issue #509
  * Changed
    - Command environment: report if running as root, with sudo, or
      setuid bit set
    - Command environment --verbose: eliminate some unneeded edid
      read tests
    - Command setvcp: Emit more more useful messages when the cause
      of a DDCRC_RETRIES error is itself a DDCRC_RETRIES error.
    - Add option --disable-traced-function-stack The default
      traced-function-stack option value (disabled) is set in
      parms.h.
  * Fixed
    - Avoid segfault if invalid feature code specified
    - Maximum wait time on function lock_display() not respected,
      possible infinte loop. Addresses issue #511
    - Fix --verify/--noverify parsing. Addresses issue #512.
    - ddca_close_display(): do not respect quiesce, allowing the
      display lock record to be released, avoiding possible
      deadlock
    - Fix the spelling of company name HON HAI PRECISION" (obtained
      from UEFI), avoiding a lintian message. Addresses issue #500
    - Fix errors reported by clang 19: unused variable, expression
      which evaluates to 0 treated as null pointer.
      Addresses issue #502.
    - Command getvcp --terse: Eliminate irrelevant messages
      regarding VCP version not set.
    - Make test for missing DRM card-connector directories more
      robust. Issue #507.
    - DDC communication not detected with old (340 series) Nvidia
      proprietary driver. Issue #507
    - Function end_capture(): call close() in case of fflush()
      error, ensuring that messages are always sent to the
      terminal after message capture complete
    - Functions ddca_find_display_ref() and ddca_get_display_ref()
      were returning a pointer to the internal Display_Ref struct
      rather than an external integer DDCA_Display_Ref, causing
      segfault or return code DDCRC_INVALID_DISPLAY on a subsequent
      api call such as ddca_open_display2(). Addresses issue #528.
    - Several API functions were not recognized as arguments to
      --trcfunc and --trcfrom. These included
      ddca_find_display_ref(), ddca_get_display_ref(),
      report_parsed_capabilities()
    - Option --stats was not reporting data
    - ddc_open_display(): return DDCRC_DISCONNECTED instead of an
      assert failure if bus_info == NULL. Addresses KDE Powerdevil
      issue #504861 (powerdevil crash from libddcutil, no restart
      happens)
    - Macro TRACED_ASSERT() calls __assert_fail() instead of
      exit(1). Addresses Powerdevil issue #504861.
    - Fix troff formatting in ddcutil man page. Pull request #531.
  * Building
    - configure option --enable-watch-displays/
      --disable-watch-displays controls whether display watch
      functionaliity is built. The default is
      --enable-watch-displays. If built with
      --disable-watch-displays, API functions related to display
      change detection return DDCRC_UNIMPLEMENTED
    - If configure option --disable-x11 is specified, the only
      watch-mode is POLL. watch-mode XEVENT does not exist.
  * Detailed information about the changes can be found in file
    CHANGELOG.md in the source tree, and on pages ddcutil 2.2.1
    Release Notes (https://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes_221/)

- Drop patch which is already included by upstream:
  * ddcutil-2.2.0-verify-noverify.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  5 06:38:20 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- reproducible builds: pass --disable-build-timestamp
- improve handling of --verify/--noverify (boo#1245807)
  add ddcutil-2.2.0-verify-noverify.patch from upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  3 08:40:34 UTC 2025 - pallas wept <pallaswept@proton.me>

- Update to 2.2.0:
  * ddcutil 2.2.0 is a major new release
  * Detecting and reporting display connection and disconnection
    has been reworked and enhanced, making libddcutil more useful
    to applications such as KDE PowerDevil, vdu_controls, and
    ddcutil-service.
  * Other enhancements include :
    - support for DisplayLink devices using driver evince
    - more consistent and extensive use of the system log
    - additional facilities for remote problem diagnosis
    - changes in building, installation, and packaging
  * And, of course, there's a year's accumulation of bug fixes
    and minor enhancements.
  * Shared library libddcutil is backwardly compatible with that
    release 2.1.4. It contains some minor changes and additional
    API functions for display change detection. The SONAME is
    unchanged as libddcutil.so.5. The release library file is
    libddcutil.so.5.2.0
  * Detailed information about the changes can be found in file 
    CHANGELOG.md in the source tree, and on pages ddcutil 2.2.0 
    Release Notes (https://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes_220/)
    and Shared Library Changes for Release 2.2.0
    (https://www.ddcutil.com/c_api_220/) on the web site.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 15 06:58:39 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to 2.1.4:
  * Restore previously deprecated API function
    ddca_create_display_ref(), still in use. It is a synonym for
    ddca_get_display_ref(), whose name better reflects the role of
    the function. Its persistence in the Debian code base blocked
    ddcutil upgrade in that distribution.
- Update to 2.1.3:
  * Release 2.1.3 fixes a significant bug in libddcutil caused by
    overzealous checking of the DDCA_Display_Reference passed to
    various API functions. The display reference for displays
    reported as invalid (typically one for which the EDID can be
    read but DDC communication fails) was being rejected on API
    functions such as ddca_get_display_info(). In particular
    addresses ddcui issue 55 which reported a crash when one or
    more displays were invalid.
- Update to 2.1.2:
  * Release 2.1.2 fixes a critical bug in libddcutil that caused
    older versions of PowerDevil to repeatedly crash and restart.
  * Additionally, there are minor bug fixes and changes to
    accommodate the proprietary Nvidia video driver.
- Update to 2.1.0:
  * Improved initialization performance
  * Dynamic sleep improvement
  * Cross-instance locking
  * Shared library libddcutil is backwardly compatible with the
    one in ddcutil 2.0.0 The SONAME is unchanged as
    libddcutil.so.5. The release library file is libddcutil.5.1.0
  * libddcutil watches for display connection and DPMS state
    changes and notifies clients.
  * Improved control of initialization messages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 19 20:59:49 UTC 2023 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- update to 2.0.0:
  * Most users will find that command ddcutil just works "out of the box", 
    without the need for manual configuration. Driver i2c-dev is loaded 
    automatically in case it was not already built into the kernel. 
    When executing on a system running systemd 
    (i.e. on almost every current Linux distribution) 
    the logged on user automatically has read-write access to the /dev/i2c devices associated with monitors, 
    making excution as root or set up of group I2C unnecessary.
  * The dynamic sleep algorithm was completely rewritten to use the minimal reliable sleep-multiplier value. 
    Explicitly using option --sleep-multiplier to optimize performance should generally be unnecessary.
  * The libddcutil API has been both extended and simplified. 
    Some necessary changes broke full backward compatibility, 
    requiring a SONAME bump from libddcutil.4 to libddcutil.5.
    Given the necessary SONAME bump, the opportunity was taken for a major API cleanup. 
    Unneeded functions were removed, including many that were previously deprecated. 
    Most client programs should build with minimal changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 23 17:14:47 UTC 2023 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Split udev rules from command line tools (main) package. Allows
  distribution wide usage of libddcutil without affecting device
  permissions and security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 28 19:44:09 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.1:
  * The default sleep-multipler value was 0, instead of 1. This resulted in
    failure of most DDC/CI operations, including display detection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 16 15:17:46 UTC 2023 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + The ability to use the write()/read() interface of i2c-dev has been restored.
    It is needed to work around a bug in the proprietary nvidia driver.  By
     default,  the write()/read() interface is used for the nvidia driver, the
     ioctl() interface is used for all other drivers. Command line options
    ***--use-file-io*** and ***--use-ioctl-io*** affect his default behavior.
    When i2c-dev's file io interface is used, option ***--force-slave-address***
    is again meaningful.
  + Option ***--sleep-multiplier*** and API functions **ddca_set_sleep_multiplier_value()**,
    **ddca_set_default_sleep_multiplier_value()** now accept 0 as a valid
    argument.
  + The ddcutil command parser reports an error if a display selection option
    (e.g. ***--bus***) is given on a command to which it does not apply.
  + Write additional error and information messages to the system log.
  + Eliminate message "Is DDC/CI enabled in the monitor's on-screen display?"
    It's rarely the cause of communication failures.
  + Warn of a possibly invalid DRM connector name in **detect** output if
    monitors with identical EDIDs are used with the proprietary nvidia driver.
  + Handle /dev/i2c device names with a double hyphen, e.g. /dev/i2c--3.
  + Better libddcutil handling of configuration file errors.  Do not abort
    initialization in case of errors.
  + Fix interpretation of digital display type bits for EDID version 1.4
  + Miscellaneous segfaults.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 09:46:20 UTC 2022 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to version 1.3.0:
  + Option --force-slave-address no longer has any effect
  + Commands getvcp and vcpinfo can now take multiple features as arguments, for example ddcutil getvcp 10 12
  + Better reporting of user configuration issues at startup.
  + The sleep-suppression related options, --sleep-less, --less-sleep, 
    --enable-sleep-suppression, and --disable-sleep-suppression no longer have any effect
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 07:30:45 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.2.2:
  + Improve handling of and messages regarding DDC communication
    failures with errno EBUSY. In particular, this error occurs
    when driver ddcci is loaded.
  + Command **detect**: If DDC communication fails with error
    EBUSY, report the display as "Busy" instead of "Invalid" and
    suggest use of option ***--force-slave-address***.
  + Command **environment**: Suggest use of option
    ***--force-slave-address*** if driver ddcci is detected.
  + Messages re EBUSY errors are always written to the system log.
  + Command **detect**:
    - Do not report the EDID source unless there is a value to
      show. This value is set only for USB connected monitors.
    - Show extended output based on option ***--verbose***, not
      undocumented option ***--very-verbose***.
    - Report color bit depth if EDID version >= 1.4
  + Command **environment**: Simplify the exploration of sysfs.
  + API changes:
    - Field latest_sl_values in struct DDCA_Feature_Metadata struct
      is no longer set,
    - API function ddca_report_display_info(): include binary
      serial number.
  + Building and porting:
    - When building ddcutil, allow for building a static library if
      **configure** option ***--enable-static*** is set. Linux
      distributions frown on packaging static libraries, but if a
      user wants to build it who am I to judge. By default, static
      libraries are not built.
    - Replace use of Linux specific function **__assert_fail()**
      with **exit()** in traced assertions.  **__assert_fail** is
      used in the Linux implementation of **assert()**, but is not
      in the C specification.  This can present a problem in
      porting ddcutil.
  + Code cleanup:
    - Delete incomplete, experimental code for asynhronous feature
      access, including files src/ddc/ddc_async.c/h.
    - Remove unused files src/util/output_sink.c/h.
  + Fixed
    - Only write Starting/Terminating messages to the system log if
      option ***--syslog*** is specified.
    - Avoid compilation warnings when assert() statments are
      disabled (NDEBUG is defined).
   - Fixed a segfault in the debug/trace code of
     ddca_get_display_refs().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 15:40:21 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Rename libddcutil3 subpackage to libddcutil4, making the package
  name actually match the provided library. conflict the wrongly
  named package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 20 10:58:27 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.2.1:
  * User Defined Features, which have existed for some time, are now formally
   available.
  * Option --mccs now applies to getvcp, setvcp, and dumpvcp as well as vcpinfo. 
  * Workaround for EDID reading issu with recent kernels and i915/docking stations
  * Configuration file ddcutilrc, located on the XDG config path (normally
    $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc) is processed by both ddcutil and
    libddcutil.
  * Monitor capabilities strings are cached to improve performance of the
    capabilities command.
  * Partial workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, AMDGPU)
    when monitors are connected to a docking station. The monitor may not be
    detected (because no EDID is reported), or the monitor may appear as two
    different /dev/i2c devices.
  * When probing /dev/i2c devices for monitors, ddcutil could put AMD Navi2
    devices (e.g. RX6000 series) into an inconsistent state. This is because
    the devices expose an I2C devices for the SMU. Display detection is
    modified to avoid probing these devices.
  * Option -enable-capabilities-cache is now the default.
  * Command ddcutil --verbose reports the raw EDID.
  * Major events are written to the system log. These include starting,
    stopping, and severe internal errors.
  * Fix for github issue #178: Error detecting i2c-dev kernel module. The
    checks are now performed using libkmod.
  * libddcutil trace output can be redirected to a file.
  * The shared library file name is libddcutil.so.4.1.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  1 06:44:37 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Remove unncessary BuildRequires on python-devel 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 16 13:20:33 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.9.9:
  * Additional per-thread statistics are shown when --verbose is specified along with --stats
  * --dynamic-sleep-adjustment
  * ddcutil no longer supports AMD's old proprietary display driver fglrx

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 25 07:26:37 UTC 2020 - Simon Lees <simonf.lees@suse.com>

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.8
  * A new command line option, --sleep-multiplier, adjusts the time ddcutil
    pauses between sending a request to the monitor and reading from the
    monitor.
    Many monitors work successfully with shorter sleep durations than required
    by the DDC/CI specification, in which case ddcutil execution time can be
    considerably reduced. On the other hand, some monitors having communication
    difficulty may work with longer sleep durations than required by the DDC/CI
    specification.
  * A bug fix for the situation where certain mice would lock up during
    display detection.
  * libddcutil api break and move to v2
  * The libddcutil shared library API has some minor extensions.
- cmake files installed to right location
- Update to ddcutil 0.9.7
  * Fixed the cause of a segfault during display detection if a monitor
    appearing to support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification, i.e. one
    that uses USB to communicate monitor settings, is connected to the system.
  * The release also contains some minor code cleanup.
- Update to ddcutil 0.9.6
  * SONAME support is enabled for libddcutil.
  * Other minor enhancements, bug fixes, and API changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 26 10:39:09 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.5
  * Feature x72 (Gamma)
    Added support for Virtual Control Panel feature x72 (Gamma). This is
    an unusual complex non-continuous feature in that its value can be
    changed by the user, and the parenthesized "values" in the
    capabilities string require special interpretation. The following
    commands have been modified:
    - ddcutil getvcp 72: Interpret the output
    - ddcutil capabilities: Interpret the parenthesized "values" substring
    - ddcutil setvcp: See below.

  * Command setvcp
    Can now take 2 byte values an an argument. Values can be specified as
    hexadecimal (SH byte then SL) or as decimal (0..65535).

  * Configuration and Diagnostics
    Contrary to existing documentation, kernel module i2c_dev is in fact
    required when using the proprietary Nvidia driver.
    Kernel module documentation has been corrected, and command ddcutil
    environment has been updated.

  * Bug Fixes
    Fix the cause of an assert failure when displaying the value of feature
    x8F (Audio Treble) or x91 (Audio Bass).

  * Monitor Quirks
    Instead of setting the "unsupported feature" bit in the getvcp reply
    packet for an unsupported feature, the Dell AW3418DW causes I2C failure
    with Linux errno EIO. ddcutil now interprets the EIO response as
    indicating an unsupported feature instead of reporting an error. This
    special handling currently applies only to the Dell AW3418DW.

  * Miscellaneous
    Update file README.md and make it more usable as the github overview file.

  * API Changes (see https://www.ddcutil.com/c_api_95/)

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.4
  * Fix the cause of failure to build from source for the x32 ABI. The file
    output by the dumpvcp command no longer contains a TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field,
    the number of seconds since start of the machine epoch, typically
    January 1, 1970. This field, and its companion TIMESTAMP_TEXT, are ignored
    on input, so this  change can only affect an external program that relies
    on the TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field, say for sorting.

  * Fix an execution failure that resulted from attempting to open an already
    opened display. This occured on the capabilities command when the vcp
    field in the string returned by the monitor was damaaged or missing,
    causing ddcutil to attempt to read the VCP version from feature 0xDF.

  * Features 0x59..0x5E (6 axis separation values). Report these values as
    normal continuous (C) values instead of just uninterpreted bytes.

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.3
  * Display Detection
    Display detection no longer performs initial probes of I2C slave addresses
    on each possible /dev/i2c device. These initial probes do not return valid
    information on a Dell P2715Q, and have been seen to cause screen corruption
    on Dell XPS 13 laptops. In addition, /dev/i2c devices for Synopsys
    DesignWare are automatically skipped.

    As a result of the changes to display detection, ddcutil detect --verbose
    no longer reports the presence of slave addresses x30 (EDID block number)
    or x37 (DDC), but does report whether a display is an Embedded Display
    Port (eDP) device, which is the case for recent laptop displays. It also
    reports the sysfs device name.

  * User Supplied Feature Definitions
    ddcutil internals have been extensively restructured for future support of
    user supplied feature definitions. This will allow users to supply feature
    definitions for manufacturer reserved features, i.e. those in the range
    xe0..xff. While not yet ready for public use, there are a couple changes
    already visible in the user interface

  * Tracing
    Added trace groups: UDF (user defined features), DDCIO (low level DDC
    functions), VCP (feature metadata).

    Because of the volume of output, trace group "DDC" has been split into DDC
    and DDCIO, with the latter containing low level DDC services.

  * API Changes
    The C API has had a few changes to support user supplied feature
    definitions and reflecting experience gained from work on the Qt C++ GUI
    interface. See API Changes in Release 9.3
    (https://www.ddcutil.com/c_api_93/) for details.

  * Miscellaneous
    Vebose output of the environment command now displays execution timestamps
    to aid in interpreting system logs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  2 10:38:11 UTC 2018 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com> - 0.9.2

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.2
  * Command ddcutil detect
    + Eliminate the Supports DDC: line. The output of this line reflects the result
      of a simple test for slave address x37 at the I2C layer. This command can
      fail on monitors that support DDC and succeed in monitors where DDC is
      turned off. The result of the x37 test is still reported as part of the
      --verbose output of detect.

    + Eliminate duplicate displays for DisplayPort connected monitors.

  * Command ddcutil --help
    + Include command scs (Save Current Settings) in the output of ddcutil --help.
      ddcutil scs executes a Save Current Settings operation, which is supported
      by some but not all DDC capable displays. This command was implemented some
      time ago, but was not described in the help output.

  * Command ddcutil environment
    + When checking for group i2c membership, issue a special message if running
      as root instead of the generic message that the current user is not a
      member of group i2c.

  * USB connected displays
    + Fix an invalid feature read of a USB connected display, observed when
      getting the controller manufacturer but VCP feature code xC8 is unsupported.

    + When reading a USB report, regard errno EINVAL as an expected indication
      that no value is found rather than an unexpected status code.

  * Tracing
    + Fix the cause of a segfault when tracing a write-only DDC exchange
      (i.e. setting a VCP value)
    + Disable debug messages regarding device id table initialization in the
      environment command.
    + Eliminate double newlines in several error and trace messages

  * Building ddcutil
    + libusb function libusb_set_debug() is deprecated in recent libusb versions,
      in favor of libusb_set_option(), resulting in a compiler warning when flag
      -Wdeprecated-declarations is set. Calls to libusb_set_debug() in file
      libusb_util.c are replaced by iftested code that uses the proper function.
    + Fix an unreachable assert() statement in file execution_stats.c that was
      detected by compiling with option -Werror-switch-unreachable.
    + Add "__attribute__ ((deprecated))" statements to functions
      ddca_report_active_displays() and ddca_get_feature_name_by_display(), in
      header file ddcutil_c_api.h. The inline documentation for these function
      already indicated their deprecated status.

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.1
  * Fix the cause of an abort that may occur on command environment --verbose
    when examining an extremely large log file.

- Update to ddcutil 0.9.0
  * Significant Command Line Changes
  * The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be
    specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or
    decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5.
    * ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5
    * ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5
  * Option --no-table is now the default.
  * Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups
    specified on getvcp, e.g. getvcp known.
  * The interpretation of --show-unsupported has been tweaked. This option
    applies to command getvcp. (The probe command always reports unsupported
    features.) Command getvcp reports unsupported features if any of the
    following hold:
    - A specific feature was specified by its code, as opposed to a feature set.
    - Verbose output is in effect
    - Option --show-unsupported was specified.
  * Options --rw and --ro apply to both the getvcp and vcpinfo commands.
    Option --wo applies only to vcpinfo.
  * Filters the information returned by vcpinfo to that for the specified
    MCCS version.
  * Additional feature sets have been defined for the getvcp and vcpinfo
    commands. They surface internal ddcutil feature descriptions, and are
    intended to facilitate exploring the MCCS specification and its
    implementation on particular monitors.
  * The VCP file created by dumpvcp now includes a PRODUCT_CODE field including
    the manufacturer product code from the EDID. For some manufacturers, the
    model name in the EDID does not in fact distinguish among models. Notably,
    Samsung commonly uses just "Syncmaster" for the model name. Currently,
    loadvcp recognizes this field name but does not make use of the value.
  * The C API has been extensively revised reflecting experience gained from
    work on a Qt C++ GUI interface. See API Changes in Release 9.0
    (http://www.ddcutil.com/c_api_90/) for details.
  * See more detailed changes at http://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes/#090

- Update to ddcutil 0.8.6
  * The externally visible changes in this release include minor enhancements
    and bug fixes. There are also changes in the C API. Internally, there have
    been extensive changes in support of the C and (future) Python APIs.
  * Because of the design of the DDC/CI protocol, there is no certain way to
    distinguish a response indicating that a feature of type Table (T) is
    unsupported from a DDC/CI protocol error. As a result, ddcutil getvcp
    performs the maximum number of retries on a Table type feature before
    giving up. However, Table type features are rarely implemented. The new
    --notable option allows Table type features to be ignored, speeding up
    execution of getvcp commmands for multiple features.
  * Option --notable applies if the argument to getvcp is a feature set, e.g.
    COLOR or KNOWN instead of a single feature id. In that case Table type
    features are ignored.
  * The use of longjmp() to handle exceptional error condiitions (typically
    program logic errors) has been eliminated.
  * API functions removed: ddca_register_jmp_buf(),
    ddca_get_global_failure_information()
  * Structs removed: DDCA_Global_Failure_Information
  * Add trace class ENV for tracing environment related functions
  * Internally, many functions in key portions of the code base now return
    exception-like structs instead of status codes. Option --excp causes
    ddcutil to report these exception-like structs when they are converted
    to status codes (and the internal detail is discarded).
  * Fix a segfault when probing DRM using the environment command on aarch64.
  * Fix a typo in the recommendations section at the end of the environment
    command.
  * See more detailed changes at http://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes/#086

- Update to ddcutil 0.8.5
  * This release contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes
  * The environment command is extensively revised. The increasingly large
    collection of tests has been consolidated.
  * The required glib-2.0 version has been increased from 2.16 to 2.32
    reflecting the use of glib thread functions.
  * Fix a logic error in the VCP version comparison function vcp_version_le().
    This bug affected only audio related VCP feature codes x8f, x91, and x93.
    It also affected experimental command watch which listens for monitor
    changes not made by ddcutil, i.e. by pressing buttons on the monitor.
  * Properly handle the failure case where a display is detected on an I2C bus
    (EDID is read) but DDC communication fails, and the user specifies the
    display on the command line using the I2C bus number (option --bus).
  * Fix the cause of a segfault when the loadvcp command reads a user modified
    VCP file. The command now fails gracefully if none of MFG_ID, MODEL,
    and SN are present.
  * Fix the cause of a segfault when displaying I2C functionality flags in the
    --environment command. This segfault was seen only in 32 bit versions of
    ddcutil.
  * The --stats option showed incorrect time statistics on 32 bit versions of
    ddcutil.
  * Add "-lddcutil" to output of "pkgconfig ddcutil --libs".
  * Improve reporting of the individual errors that result in command failure
    due to maximum I2C retries exceeded.
  * interrogate, environment and usbenvironment now redirect all stderr output
    to stdout for easier capture
  * Added command line options -trcfile and -trcfunc to enable tracing by
    file name and function name.
  * Added configuration option --enable-x11 controlling whether X11 related
    diagnostics are included in the environment and interrogate commands,
    allowing ddcutil to build in embedded environments that lack X11.
    The default is yes.
  * Verbose EDID decription, e.g. on command detect --verbose, now reports EDID
    byte 24 (x14), the supported features bitmap. This is purely informational.
  * Ongoing work to make functions thread safe.
  * Code cleanup.
  * The full list of changes can be read at
