%description
Dagger is a portable devkit for CICD.

Using Dagger, software teams can develop powerful CICD pipelines with minimal effort, then run them anywhere. Benefits include:
* Unify dev and CI environments. Write your pipeline once, Dagger will run it the same everywhere.
* Reduce CI lock-in. No more re-writing everything from scratch every 6 months.
