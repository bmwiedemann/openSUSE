  <title>letsencrypt/acme client implemented as a shell-script</title>
  <description>A client for signing certificates with an ACME-server (currently only provided by letsencrypt) implemented as a relatively simple bash-script.

It uses the openssl utility for everything related to actually handling keys and certificates, so you need to have that installed.

Other dependencies are: curl, sed, grep, mktemp (all found on almost any system, curl being the only exception)

Current features:

* Signing of a list of domains
* Signing of a CSR
* Renewal if a certificate is about to expire or SAN (subdomains) changed
* Certificate revocation
