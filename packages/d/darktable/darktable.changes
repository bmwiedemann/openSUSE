      shortcut `ctrl-f` doesn't work as it's used for filmstrip
      already
    - Add a debug print when compiling OpenCL kernels
  - Bugfixes
    - Use the configured overwrite color profile when exporting
      from Lua – this broke GIMP integration
    - Support presets with `<` in their name

      separator on Windows

Sun Dec 24 11:14:52 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.4.0
  - The maintainership of the RawSpeed library was transferred to
    the darktable project. The work on code cleanup, hardening,
    modernization, simplification and testing is ongoing.
  - Almost 3 thousand commits to darktable+rawspeed since 2.2.0
  - 273 pull requests handled
  - 340+ issues closed
  - Updated user manual is coming soon™

  - The Big Ones
    - A new module for haze removal
    - The local contrast module can now be pushed much further, it
      also got a new [local
      laplacian](https://www.darktable.org/2017/11/local-laplacian-pyramids/)
      mode
    - Add undo support for masks and more intelligent grouping of
      undo steps
    - Blending now allows to display individual channels using
      false colors
    - darktable now supports loading Fujifilm compressed RAFs
    - darktable now supports loading floating point HDR DNGs as
      written by HDRMERGE
    - We also added channel specific blend modes for Lab and RGB
      color spaces
    - The base curve module allows for more control of the
      [exposure
      fusion](https://www.darktable.org/2016/08/compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion/)
      feature using the newly added bias slider
    - The tonecurve module now supports auto colour adjustment in
      RGB
    - Add absolute color input as an option to the color look up
      table module
    - A new X-Trans demosaicing algorithm, Frequency Domain Chroma,
      was implemented.
    - You can now choose from pre-defined scheduling profiles for
      OpenCL
    - Speaking of OpenCL, darktable now allows to force-use OpenCL
      for a specific pixelpipe
    - XMP sidecar files are no longer written to disk when the
      content didn't actually change. That mostly helps with
      network storage and backup systems that use files' time
      stamps

  - New Features And Changes
    - Show a dialog window that tells when locking the
      database/library failed
    - Don't shade the whole region on the map when searching for a
      location. Instead just draw a border around it.
    - Also in map mode: Clear the search list and map indicators
      when resetting the search module.
    - With OsmGPSMap newer than version 1.1.0 (i.e., anything
      released after that OsmGPSMap version) the map will show
      copyright info.
    - Running jobs with a progressbar (mostly import and export)
      will show that progress bar ontop the window entry in your
      task bar – if the system supports it. It should work on
      GNOME, KDE and Windows at least.
    - Add bash like string replacement for variables (export,
      watermark, session settings)
    - Add a preferences option to ask before removing empty dirs
    - The "colorbalance" module got a lot faster, thanks to SSE
      optimized code
    - Make gradient sliders a little more colorful
    - Make PNG compression level used for exporting configurable
    - On OSX, load single images from command line or via drag&drop
      in darkroom mode
    - Add an option to omit the intermediate tag hierarchy in
      exported files and only add the last level
    - In the watermark module, sort the list of SVG files and omit
      the file extension
    - Support XYZ as a proofing profile
    - Local contrast now got a new slider to set the midtone range
    - darktable got two new helper scripts (those are not installed
      by default, grab them from [the sources](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/tree/master/tools))
      - One to purge thumbnails that no longer have an associated
        image in the database,
      - and a second script that uses inotify to watch a folder
        for new files to open them in a running darktable
          instance.
    - In the curve editors of base curve and tone curve you can now
      delete nodes with a right click and see coordinates of nodes
      while editing. Note that you can use keyboard modifiers
        `ctrl` and `shift` to change the precision of your changes
    - Creating a new instance of a module can now be done with a
      quick click of the middle mouse button on the multi-instance
      icon
    - New darktable installations on computers with more than 8 Gb
      of memory will now by default use half of that per module
    - Several background colors and the brush color are now
      configurable in the CSS
    - Some new cameras can bump the ISO level to insane highs. We
      try to follow as good as we can by no longer limiting it to
      51200 in the GUI
    - Base curve and the highlights module now support multiple
      instances and use blending and masks
    - Having the `1` key toggle between 1 and 0 stars wasn't very
      popular with many people. You can disable that extra feature
      and have it behave like the other rating shortcuts now
    - You can decide if you want to be asked before resetting the
      history stacks of images from the lighttable
    - The grain module was slightly changed to have a more
      pleasing, photographic-paper like appearance
    - Using the color look up table module you can now convert your
      images to monochrome, honoring the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch
      effect
    - Support basic import of Lightroom 7 settings
    - Change the styling of insensitive bauhaus widgets
    - Don't hide the mode combobox in the exposure module, just
      disable it
    - Read primaries and whitepoint from .hdr files and default to
      those as the input color profile
    - Some more small improvements were made
  - Bugfixes
    - Fix the problem with rating images by accident when moving
      the mouse while typing an image size in the export module
    - Fix several oddities in folder and tag mode of the collect
      module
    - Print mode's color profile settings no longer interact with
      the export module
    - Update the style lists when importing a style
    - Fix some bugs with multiple module instances used in a style
    - On OSX only the main window should be fullscreen, not the
      popups
    - Some speedups with VERY big libraries or having A LOT OF tags
    - Significantly speed up tagging many images
    - Fix searching locations using OpenStreetMap
    - Fix partial copies of large files in "import from camera"
    - Fix a crash in the import dialog when using Lua to add
      widgets there
    - Fix some false-positive warnings about another running
      darktable instance and it having locked the databases
    - No longer switch to the favourite modules group when
      duplicating one of its modules
    - Fix loading of XYZ files
    - Fix Lab export when the profile was set from the lighttable
    - Create temporary snapshot files with mode 0600 to stop other
      people looking at them
    - Fix several bugs with Wayland. However, there are still
      issues, so darktable will prefer XWayland
    - Google deprecated the Picasa Web API so it's no longer
      possible to create G+ albums
    - Fix the default for sliders with target not being "red" in
      the channel mixer
    - Fix the removal of directories
    - Make the escape key cancel history dialogs
    - Block keyboard accels when editing camera controls
    - Properly delete XMP sidecars
    - Make sure that the rating set in darktable is used for the
      exported file, not something set inside the raw file
    - Don't re-write all XMP files when detaching a tag
    - Sync XMPs when a tag is removed from the database
    - Sync XMPs after a tag is attached/detached via the Lua API
    - Bail out of darktable-cli when the XMP file is not readable
    - Show ratings on zoomable lighttable without a delay
    - Rely on CUPS color management when printing without
      configuring any color profile in darktable
    - Fix spurious segfault in local contrast
    - Make calls to exiv2's readMetadata thread safe to not crash
      randomly
    - Properly read Lightroom XMPs on systems with `,` as the
      decimal separator
    - Fix setting the PNG bit depth from the gui
    - Many more bugs got fixed
  - Lua
    - darktable now uses Lua 5.3. The bundled copy got updated
      accordingly
    - Add dt.print_log. It's like print_error but without the ERROR
      prefix
    - Reorder callback parameters for intermediate export image:
      add the actual image to the parameters of the event
    - Call lua post-import-image event synchronously
    - Add darktable.configuration.running_os to detect the OS
      darktable is running on
    - New widget type: section_label, adds a label which looks like
      a section change

Mon Dec 18 17:45:19 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added llvm5.patch: list of llvm version is hardcoded and llvm 5,
  while it works for building, wasn't searched for.
- package the darktable basecurve tool in a new subpackage
- make sure pdf documentation never ends up in the main package
- drop non suse support
- drop ix86 support. 64bit only from now on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 18 16:46:00 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 2.4.0.rc2
  - The maintainership of the RawSpeed library was transferred to
    the darktable project. The work on code cleanup, hardening,
    modernization, simplification and testing is ongoing.
  - Well over 2 thousand commits to darktable+rawspeed since 2.2.0
  - 244 pull requests handled
  - 320+ issues closed
  - Updated user manual is coming soon™

  - The Big Ones
    - A new module for haze removal
    - The local contrast module can now be pushed much further, it
      also got a new local laplacian mode
    - Add undo support for masks and more intelligent grouping of
      undo steps
    - Blending now allows to display individual channels using
      false colors
    - darktable now supports loading Fujifilm compressed RAFs
    - darktable now supports loading floating point HDR DNGs as
      written by HDRMERGE
    - We also added channel specific blend modes for Lab and RGB
      color spaces
    - The base curve module allows for more control of the exposure
      fusion feature using the newly added bias slider
    - The tonecurve module now supports auto colour adjustment in
      RGB
    - Add absolute color input as an option to the color look up
      table module
    - A new X-Trans demosaicing algorithm, Frequency Domain Chroma,
      was implemented.
    - You can now choose from pre-defined scheduling profiles for
      OpenCL
    - Speaking of OpenCL, darktable now allows to force-use OpenCL
      for a specific pixelpipe
    - Xmp sidecar files are no longer written to disk when the
      content didn't actually change. That mostly helps with
      network storage and backup systems that use files' time
      stamps
  - New Features And Changes
    - Show a dialog window that tells when locking the
      database/library failed
    - Don't shade the whole region on the map when searching for a
      location. Instead just draw a border around it.
    - Also in map mode: Clear the search list and map indicators
      when resetting the search module.
    - With OsmGPSMap newer than version 1.1.0 (i.e., anything
      released after that OsmGPSMap version) the map will show
      copyright info.
    - Running jobs with a progressbar (mostly import and export)
      will show that progress bar ontop the window entry in your
      task bar – if the system supports it. It should work on
      GNOME, KDE and Windows at least.
    - Add bash like string replacement for variables (export,
      watermark, session settings).
    - Add a preferences option to ask before removing empty dirs
    - The "colorbalance" module got a lot faster, thanks to SSE
      optimized code
    - Make gradient sliders a little more colorful
    - Make PNG compression level used for exporting configurable
    - On OSX, load single images from command line or via drag&drop
      in darkroom mode
    - Add an option to omit the intermediate tag hierarchy in
      exported files and only add the last level
    - In the watermark module, sort the list of SVG files and omit
      the file extension
    - Support XYZ as a proofing profile
    - Local contrast now got a new slider to set the midtone range
    - darktable got two new helper scripts (those are not installed
      by default, grab them from the sources): One to purge
      thumbnails that no longer have an associated image in the
      database, and a second script that uses inotify to watch a
      folder for new files to open them in a running darktable
      instance.
    - In the curve editors of base curve and tone curve you can now
      delete nodes with a right click and see coordinates of nodes
      while editing. Note that you can use keyboard modifiers ctrl
        and shift to change the precision of your changes
    - Creating a new instance of a module can now be done with a
      quick click of the middle mouse button on the multi-instance
      icon
    - New darktable installations on computers with more than 8 Gb
      of memory will now by default use half of that per module
    - Several background colors and the brush color are now
      configurable in the CSS
    - Some new cameras can bump the ISO level to insane highs. We
      try to follow as good as we can by no longer limiting it to
      51200 in the GUI
    - Base curve and the highlights module now support multiple
      instances and use blending and masks
    - Having the `1` key toggle between 1 and 0 stars wasn't very
      popular with many people. You can disable that extra feature
      and have it behave like the other rating shortcuts now
    - You can decide if you want to be asked before resetting the
      history stacks of images from the lighttable
    - The grain module was slightly changed to have a more
      pleasing, photographic-paper like appearance
    - Using the color look up table module you can now convert your
      images to monochrome, honoring the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch
      effect
    - Some more small improvements were made
    - Support basic import of Lightroom 7 settings
    - Change the styling of insensitive bauhaus widgets
    - Don't hide the mode combobox in the exposure module, just
      disable it
  - Bugfixes
    - Fix the problem with rating images by accident when moving
      the mouse while typing an image size in the export module
    - Fix several oddities in folder and tag mode of the collect
      module.
    - Print mode's color profile settings no longer interact with
      the export module
    - Update the style lists when importing a style
    - Fix some bugs with multiple module instances used in a style
    - On OSX only the main window should be fullscreen, not the
      popups
    - Some speedups with VERY big libraries or having A LOT OF tags
    - Significantly speed up tagging many images
    - Fix searching locations using OpenStreetMap
    - Fix partial copies of large files in "import from camera"
    - Fix a crash in the import dialog when using Lua to add
      widgets there
    - Fix some false-positive warnings about another running
      darktable instance and it having locked the databases
    - No longer switch to the favourite modules group when
      duplicating one of its modules
    - Fix loading of XYZ files
    - Fix Lab export when the profile was set from the lighttable
    - Create tmp snapshot files with mode 0600 to stop other people
      looking at them
    - Fix several bugs with Wayland. However, there are still
      issues, so darktable will prefer XWayland
    - Google deprecated the Picasa Web API so it's no longer
      possible to create G+ albums
    - Fix the default for sliders with target not being "red" in
      the channel mixer
    - Fix the removing of directories
    - Make the escape key cancel history dialogs
    - Block keyboard accels when editing camera controls
    - Properly delete XMP sidecars
    - Make sure that the rating set in darktable is used for the
      exported file, not something set inside the raw file
    - Don't re-write all XMP files when detaching a tag
    - Sync XMPs when a tag is removed from the database
    - Sync XMPs after a tag is attached/detached via the Lua API
    - Bail out of darktable-cli when the XMP file is not readable
    - Show ratings on zoomable lighttable without a delay
    - Rely on CUPS color management when printing without
      configuring any color profile in darktable
    - Many more bugs got fixed
    - Fix spurious segfault in local contrast
    - Make calls to exiv2's readMetadata thread safe to not crash
      randomly
  - Lua
    - darktable now uses Lua 5.3. The bundled copy got updated
      accordingly
    - Add dt.print_log. It's like print_error but without the ERROR
      prefix
    - Reorder callback parameters for intermediate export image:
      add the actual image to the parameters of the event
    - Call lua post-import-image event synchronously
    - Add darktable.configuration.running_os to detect the OS
      darktable is running on
    - New widget type: section_label, adds a label which looks like
      a section change
  - Changed Dependencies
    - CMake 3.1 is now required.
    - In order to compile darktable you now need at least
      gcc-4.9+/clang-3.4+, and gcc-5.0+ is *highly* recommended.
    - ZLIB is now required for the DNG Deflate compressed raw
      support.
    - darktable now uses Lua 5.3
  - Camera support, compared to 2.2.0
    Warning: support for Nikon NEF 'lossy after split' raws was
    unintentionally broken due to the lack of such samples. Please
    see https://discuss.pixls.us/t/nikon-a-specific-raw-sample-wanted/5483
    for more details. If you have affected raws, please contribute samples!

- update to 2.2.0:

  Well over 2k commits since 2.0.0

  - The Big Ones:
    - Add new automatic perspective correction module
      (https://www.darktable.org/2016/03/a-new-module-for-automatic-perspective-correction/)
    - Liquify tool for all your fancy pixel moving
      (https://www.darktable.org/2016/04/liquify-liquify/)
    - A new image module to use a Color Look Up Table (CLUT) to
      change colors in the image
      (https://www.darktable.org/2016/05/colour-manipulation-with-the-colour-checker-lut-module/)
    - In Highlight reconstruction module, the mode LCh
      reconstruction was completely rewritten, and is no longer
      useless!
    - A new tool, darktable-chart, that goes along with the CLUT
      module, to create styles for the latter
    - Exposure fusion in the basecurve module to lower the dynamic
      range of images
      (https://www.darktable.org/2016/08/compressing-dynamic-range-with-exposure-fusion/)
    - Add new raw overexposure indication
      (https://www.darktable.org/2016/10/raw-overexposed/)
    - Darkroom: the preview (in top-left corner) is now no longer
      pre-demosaiced (but just downscaled without demosaicing it at
      the same time), thus the preview, color picker, histogram
      show the proper results, especially when there is highlight
      clipping.
  - Quite Interesting Changes:
    - Split the database into a library containing images and a
      general one with styles, presets and tags. That allows having
      access to those when for example running with a :memory:
      library
    - Support running on platforms other than x86 (64bit
      little-endian, currently ARM64 only)
    (https://www.darktable.org/2016/04/running-on-non-x86-platforms/)
    - darktable is now happy to use smaller stack sizes (no less
      than 256Kb). That should allow using musl libc
    - Allow darktable-cli to work on directories
    - Allow to import/export tags from Lightroom keyword files
    - Allow using modifier keys to modify the step for sliders and
      curves. Defaults: Ctrl - x0.1; Shift - x10
    - Allow using the [keyboard] cursor keys to interact with
      sliders, comboboxes and curves; modifiers apply too
    - Support presets in "more modules" so you can quickly switch
      between your favorite sets of modules shown in the GUI
    - Add range operator and date compare to the collection module
    - Add basic undo/redo support for the darkroom (masks are not
      accounted !)
    - Support the Exif date and time when importing photos from
      camera
    - Input color profile module, when profile is just matrix (and
      linear curve), is 1/3 faster now.
    - Rudimentary CYGM and RGBE color filter array support
    - Nicer web gallery exporter -- now touch friendly!
    - OpenCL implementation of VNG/VNG4 demosaicing methods
    - OpenCL implementation of Markesteijn demosaicing method for
      X-Trans sensors
    - Filter-out some useless EXIF tags when exporting, helps keep
      EXIF size under ~64Kb
    - OpenCL: properly discard CPU-based OpenCL devices. Fixes
      crashes on startup with some partially-working OpenCL
      implementations like pocl.
    - darktable-cli: do not even try to open display, we don't need
      it.
    - Hotpixels module: make it actually work for X-Trans
    - Cmstest tool should now produce correct output in more cases,
      especially in multi-monitor setups.
    - Darkroom histogram now uses more bins: use all 8-bit of the
      output, not just 6.
  - Some More Changes, Probably Not Complete:
    - Drop darktable-viewer tool in favor of slideshow view
    - Remove gnome keyring password backend, use libsecret instead
    - When using libsecret to store passwords then put them into
      the correct collection
    - Hint via window manager when import/export is done
    - Quick tagging searches anywhere, not just at the start of
      tags
    - The sidecar XMP schema for history entries is now more
      consistent and less error prone
    - Rawspeed: fixes for building with libjpeg (as opposed to
      libjpeg-turbo)
    - Give the choice of equidistant and proportional feathering
      when using elliptical masks (shift+click)
    - Add geolocation to watermark variables
    - Fix some crashes with missing configured ICC profiles
    - Support greyscale color profiles
    - Lens correction module: switched back to normal Lensfun
      search mode for lens lookups.
    - Make sure that proper signal handlers are still set after GM
      initialization...
    - OSX: add trash support (thanks to Michael Kefeder for initial
      patch)
    - Attach Xmp data to EXR files
    - Several fixes for HighDPI displays
    - Use Pango for text layout, thus supporting RTL languages
    - Feathering size in some mask shapes can be set with
      shift+scroll
    - Many bugs got fixed and some memory leaks plugged
    - The usermanual was updated to reflect the changes in the 2.2
      series
    - Tone curve: mode "automatic in XYZ" mode for "scale chroma"
    - Some compilation fixes
  - Lua specific changes:
    - All asynchronous calls have been rewritten
      - the darktable-specific implementation of yield was removed
      - darktable.control.execute allows to execute some shell
        commands without blocking Lua
      - darktable.control.read allows to wait for a file to be
        readable without blocking Lua
      - darktable.control.sleep allows to pause the Lua execution
        without blocking other Lua threads
    - darktable.gui.libs.metadata_view.register_info allows to add
      new field to the metadata widget in the darkroom view
    - The TextView widget can now be created in Lua, allowing input
      of large chunks of text
    - It is now possible to use a custom widget in the Lua
      preference window to configure a preference
    - It is now possible to set the precision and step on slider
      widgets
  - Changed Dependencies:
    - CMake 3.0 is now required.
    - In order to compile darktable you now need at least
      gcc-4.7+/clang-3.3+, but better use gcc-5.0+
    - Drop support for OS X 10.6
    - Bump required libexiv2 version up to 0.24
    - Bump GTK+ requirement to gtk-3.14. (because even debian
      stable has it)
    - Bump GLib requirement to glib-2.40.
    - Port to OpenJPEG2
    - SDL is no longer needed.
    - Remove gnome keyring password backend

  when updating from the currently stable 1.6.x series, please bear
  in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process,
  but it will not be possible to downgrade from 2.0 to 1.6.x any
  more.

  Robert Hutton has done a video covering the new features and
  other changes between darktable 1.6 and 2.0:
  https://youtu.be/VJbJ0btlui0

  gui:
  * darktable has been ported to gtk-3.0
  * the viewport in darkroom mode is now dynamically sized, you
    specify the border width
  * side panels now default to a width of 350px in dt 2.0
    instead of 300px in dt 1.6
  * further hidpi enhancements
  * navigating lighttable with arrow keys and space/enter
  * brush size/hardness/opacity have key accels
  * allow adding tone- and basecurve nodes with ctrl-click

  features:
  * new print mode
  * reworked screen color management (softproof, gamut check etc.)
  * delete/trash feature
  * pdf export
  * export can upscale
  * new "mode" parameter in the export panel to fine tune
    application of styles upon export

  * new thumbnail cache replaces mipmap cache (much improved speed,
    stability and seamless support for even up to 4K/5K screens)
  * all thumbnails are now properly fully color-managed
  * it is now possible to generate thumbnails for all images in the
    library using new darktable-generate-cache tool
  * we no longer drop history entries above the selected one when
    leaving darkroom mode or switching images
  * high quality export now downsamples before watermark and
    framing to guarantee consistent results
  * optimizations to loading jpeg's when using libjpeg-turbo with
    its custom features

    in some cases
  * noiseprofiles are in external JSON file now
  * aspect ratios for crop&rotate can be added to config file

  image operations:

  * more proper Kelvin temperature, fine-tuning preset
    interpolation in white balance iop
  * monochrome raw demosaicing (for cameras with color filter array
    physically removed)

  * removed dependency on libsquish (solves patent issues as a side
    effect)
  * unbundled pugixml, osm-gps-map and colord-gtk

  generic:
  * 32-bit support is soft-deprecated due to limited virtual
    address space
  * support for building with gcc earlier than 4.8 is
    soft-deprecated
  * numerous memory leaks were exterminated
  * overall stability enhancements

  scripting:
  * lua scripts can now add UI elements to the lighttable view
    (buttons, sliders etc...)

- Update to release candidate 1.4~rc1
  * darktable now integrates a lua engine that allows writing scripts
    to make it easier to use with other image processing software.
    These scripts can be run when a particular event takes place (for
    example when a new image is imported) or when a particular keyboard
    shortcut is used. There are very few scripts available at this
    point but we expect the community to provide some more during the
    next release cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 26 17:55:55 UTC 2013 - mrueckert@suse.de

- First set CFLAGS and then CXXFLAGS. Sometimes we need to set
  flags in CXXFLAGS that are not valid CFLAGS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 23 23:20:01 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Fix factory build with OpenEXR-2.0
  added 0001-OpenEXR-2.0-fixes.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 16:31:09 UTC 2013 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to release 1.2
- removed
  darktable-1.2.x_update_to_4b856e6ec99035d5a1041db73e2339000d395aa0.patch
  as it is now included.
- When possible use pkgconfig hence:
   instead of libopenjgeg-devel  used  pkgconfig(libopenjpeg)
   instead of GraphicsMagick-devel used pkgconfig(GraphicsMagick)

- If build is for 12.1 then require gtk2-engines

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 13:39:08 UTC 2013 - mrueckert@suse.de

- added darktable-1.2.x_update_to_4b856e6ec99035d5a1041db73e2339000d395aa0.patch:
  update to HEAD (4b856e6ec99035d5a1041db73e2339000d395aa0)
  - adobe_coeff: Nikon Coolpix A same as D7000
  - fix-crash-lr-import:
    Proactive fix to avoid a crash trying to dereference a null
    pointer.  If node stEvt:softwareAgent not found, skip as not a
    lightroom xmp.
  - don't crash on malformatted TIFF file
    In case a file was alraedy rejected by GraphicsMagick, it's not
    a good idea to try open it with our handmade imageio routines
    like TIFFOpen().  Let's take GraphicsMagick as a last resort if
    available.
  - usermanual: add missing file lighttable_directory.png
  - Fix: snapshot + gnd, cliping, ... #9329
  - Upgraded and reviewed Spanish translation
    I have fully reviewed the Spanish translation, fixing typos,
    improving grammar and the language used.
  - denoiseprofile: really fix legacy_params
  - denoiseprofile: get param "mode" right when converting params
    from version 2 to 3 fix: denoiseprofile: crash when trying to
    update presets/styles from version 2 to 3 do not try to find
    autodetection for them - would probably be not useful and is
    impossible anyway
  - Merge pull request #206 from bluesceada/denoise-copy-autodetect
    denoiseprofile: copy "profile autodetected" correctly + fix:
    display "found match" also for first profile
  - noise profile: canon eos 1d iv by rene weiss
  - denoiseprofile: only use a[0] = -1.0 to signal autodetection,
    and don't use epsilon for comparisons
  - denoiseprofile: make it possible to copy the information "this
    profile was set automatically" across images with different ISO
    and camera vendor
  - fix: denoiseprofile: also show "found match:" instead of the
    profile name for index 0
  - Preliminary update of the Russian translation
  - Merge branch 'fix-clipping-aspect'
    * fix-clipping-aspect:
      Fix aspect ratio computation.
      It cannot happen in legacy_params() as at this point the size
      of the image is not yet known. We then use a deferred
      circuitry to handle this at the right point in the code.
      Fixes #9320.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 27 07:56:26 UTC 2012 - toganm@opensuse.org

- Update to release 1.1
  * general
    + new camera support, new whitebalance presets, etc., including
      canon eos m support and samsung nx fix
    + similarity matching search for images that look alike.
    + geotagging, complete with map view
    + a lot of bugfixes (mainly thanks to ulrich for his meticulous
      work)
    + facebook exporter (for those who have an account there)
  * ui
    + reworked the much hated `more plugins' widget
    + image grouping:
    + command line interface!
    + tone and base curves got a new user interface to better
      support fine grained workflow
    + visually low-profile controls with finetuning:
    + color correction module got a GUI update since the blog post
      (two circles indicating shadows and highlights instead of the
      quad).
    + live view for tethered shooting!
  * darkroom
    + extensive use of edge-aware filtering techniques to suppress
      noise, halos and ringing all around darktable:
    + conditional blending, and a lot of goodies around it!
    + magenta highlights: high-contrast edges to overexposed areas
      (should get rid of purple highlights on tiny water waves and
      purple fringes around tree leaves for example)
    + much improved sharpness for both export and darkroom view,
      especially for downsampled images and if you use lens
      corrections or rotations/perspective corrections. check the new
      options in the preferences dialog, also one more than mentioned
      in the blog ("demosaicing for zoomed out darkroom mode" to
      trade performance for even more sharpness):
  * color management
    + improved per-screen color management (should reload the
      screen profile automatically)
    + more compatible embedded color profiles (should fix problems
      on windows viewing our images, if that matters) read embedded
      color profiles from jpg
  * opencl
    + most of our modules now can take advantage of your computer's
      gpu power
    + caching for compiled opencl kernels (even in case the driver
      doesn't do it) for faster startup times
  * translations
    + two new translations (both portuguese.. ;) )
    + well translated: cs de es fr it ja nl pl pt_BR pt_PT sv
    + half translated: ca fi gl ro ru sq th zh_CN
