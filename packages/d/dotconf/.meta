  <title>Configuration file parser library</title>
  <description>dotconf is a simple-to-use and powerful configuration-file parser
library written in C. The configuration files created for dotconf look
very similar to those used by the Apache Webserver. Even
Container-Directives known from httpd.conf can easily be used in the
exact same manner as for Apache-Modules. It supports various types of
arguments, dynamically loadable modules that create their own
configuration options on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass very
long ARG_STR data to your app, and on-the-fly inclusion of additional
config files.</description>
