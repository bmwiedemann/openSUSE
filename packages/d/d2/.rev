  * CLI: attempts writing to path atomically, falling back to non-atomic if failed #2141
  * Export: pptx has &quot;created at&quot; metadata removed, so successive runs yield the same result #2169
  * Formatter: empty board keywords (e.g. layers) are removed #2178
  * Render: a tooltip or link by itself will not expand width of shape #2183
  * Render: fixes edge case of a 3d shape with outside label being cut off #2132
  * Composition: labels for boards set with shorthand x: y was not applied #2182
  * Globs: double globs (**) were erroring when used with multiple scenario boards #2195

  * Misc: support for characters in the Latin-1 and geometric shapes unicode range #2100
  * Imports: can now import from absolute file paths #2113
