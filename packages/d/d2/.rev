    <version>0.6.8</version>
    <time>1736279487</time>
    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 0.6.8:
  * Render: SVG files render in non-browser contexts (e.g. Inkscape, LaTeX) #2147
  * Lib: removes a dependency on external slog that was causing troubles with installation #2137
  * CLI: attempts writing to path atomically, falling back to non-atomic if failed #2141
  * Export: pptx has &quot;created at&quot; metadata removed, so successive runs yield the same result #2169
  * Formatter: empty board keywords (e.g. layers) are removed #2178
  * Render: a tooltip or link by itself will not expand width of shape #2183
  * Render: fixes edge case of a 3d shape with outside label being cut off #2132
  * Composition: labels for boards set with shorthand x: y was not applied #2182
  * Globs: double globs (**) were erroring when used with multiple scenario boards #2195
- Update to version 0.6.7:
  * Vars: Variable definitions can refer to other variables in the current scope #2052
  * Composition: Imported boards can use underscores to reference boards beyond its own scope 
    (e.g. to a sibling board at the scope its imported to) #2075
  * Autoformat: Reserved keywords are formatted to be lowercase #2098
  * Misc: support for characters in the Latin-1 and geometric shapes unicode range #2100
  * Imports: can now import from absolute file paths #2113
  * Render: linear and radial gradients are now available for fill, stroke and font-color #2120
  * Sequence diagram: edge groups account for edge label heights #2038
  * Sequence diagram: self-referential edges account for edge label heights #2040
  * Sequence diagram: The spacing between self-referential edges and regular edges is uniform #2043
  * Compiler: Error on multi-line labels in sql_table shapes #2057
  * Sequence diagram: Image shape actors can use spans and notes #2056
  * Globs: Filters work with default values (e.g. &amp;opacity: 1 will capture everything without opacity explicitly set) #2090

    <user>anag+factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 0.6.9:
  * Animations: style.animated: true is supported on shapes #2250
  * Connections now support link #1955
  * Vars: vars in markdown blocks are substituted #2218
  * Markdown: Github-flavored tables work in md blocks #2221
  * Render: adds box arrowheads #2227
  * d2 fmt now supports a --check flag #2253
  * CLI: PNG output to stdout is supported using --stdout-format png - #2291
  * Globs: &amp;connected and &amp;leaf filters are implemented #2299
  * CLI: add --no-xml-tag for direct HTML embedding #2302
  * CLI: play cmd added for opening d2 input in online playground #2242
  * Composition: links pointing to own board are purged #2203
  * Syntax: reserved keywords must be unquoted #2231
  * Latex: Backslashes in Latex blocks do not escape #2232
    This is a breaking change. Previously Latex blocks required
    escaping the backslash. So for older D2 versions, you should
    remove the excess backslashes.
  * Links: non-http url scheme links are supported (e.g. x.link: vscode://file/) #2237
  * Compiler: reserved keywords with missing values error instead of silently doing nothing #2251
  * Render: SVG outputs conform to stricter HTML standards, e.g. no duplicate ids #2273
  * Themes: theme names are consistently cased #2322
  * Nears: constant nears avoid collision with edge routes #2327
- Packaging improvements:
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) &gt;= 1.23 matching go.mod
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS=&quot;-buildmode=pie&quot; %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time. (forwarded request 1243573 from jfkw)</comment>

  * Compiler: fixes panic when importing from a file with spread substitutions in vars #2427

  * Compiler: fixes globs not applying to spread substitutions #2426
  * Compiler: fixes panic when classes were mixed with layers incorrectly #2448
  * Compiler: fixes panic when gradient colors are used in sketch mode #2481
  * Compiler: fixes panic using glob ampersand filters with composite values #2489

    flags #2590
  * labels on scenario/step boards can be set with primary value (like layers) #2579
  * autoformatter preserves order of boards #2580
  * rename &quot;Legend&quot; with a title/label of your choosing (especially
    useful for non-English diagrams) #2582
  * sketch mode fonts will use custom fonts if provided #2582
  * actors in sequence diagrams with labels and icons together no
    longer overlap, position keywords now work too #2548
  * fix double glob behavior in scenarios (wasn't propagating correctly) #2557
  * fix diagram bounding box not accounting for legend in some cases #2584
  * Breaking Changes: If you are using D2 as a library/API, passing
    in a FontFamily with sketch renders will now use the font,
    instead of previously ignoring it.
