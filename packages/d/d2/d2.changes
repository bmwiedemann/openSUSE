Wed Feb  5 07:54:04 UTC 2025 - Jeff Kowalczyk <jkowalczyk@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.6.9:
  * Animations: style.animated: true is supported on shapes #2250
  * Connections now support link #1955
  * Vars: vars in markdown blocks are substituted #2218
  * Markdown: Github-flavored tables work in md blocks #2221

  * CLI: PNG output to stdout is supported using --stdout-format png - #2291
  * Globs: &connected and &leaf filters are implemented #2299
  * CLI: add --no-xml-tag for direct HTML embedding #2302
  * CLI: play cmd added for opening d2 input in online playground #2242
  * Composition: links pointing to own board are purged #2203
  * Syntax: reserved keywords must be unquoted #2231
  * Latex: Backslashes in Latex blocks do not escape #2232
    This is a breaking change. Previously Latex blocks required
    escaping the backslash. So for older D2 versions, you should
    remove the excess backslashes.

  * Compiler: reserved keywords with missing values error instead of silently doing nothing #2251
  * Render: SVG outputs conform to stricter HTML standards, e.g. no duplicate ids #2273
  * Themes: theme names are consistently cased #2322
  * Nears: constant nears avoid collision with edge routes #2327
  * Imports: fixes using substitutions in icon values #2207
  * Markdown: fixes ampersands in URLs in markdown #2219
  * Globs: fixes edge case where globs with imported boards would create empty boards #2247
  * Sequence diagrams: fixes alignment of notes when self messages are above it #2264
  * Null: fixes nulling a connection with absolute syntax #2318
  * Gradients: works with connection fills #2326
  * Latex: fixes backslashes doubling on successive parses #2328
- Packaging improvements:
  * Update to BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.23 matching go.mod
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
