- Update to release 2.2.1.1
  * The built-in scripting language has gained wider integration
    in the engine internals.
  * Scripted mobj actions
  * A number of modding related improvements have been done for
    Heretic. For example: customizable menu labels, enhanced
    intermission screen, Values for ammo per shot, support for
    Hexen-like wall-bouncing missiles, and a script binding for
    starting an enemy’s attack.
  * Separate FOV for rendering player weapons
  * Doomsday now detects Freedoom v0.12.1.

Sat Nov  2 00:02:30 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

  as an explicit BuildRequires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  2 15:10:46 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 2.1.1
  * Graphics optimizations: While games still use the classic
    renderer like in 2.0, all graphics are now drawn using OpenGL
    3.3. This enables optimizations for more efficient rendering
    of the player view, menus, text, and the Doomsday UI.
  * UI improvements: The Doomsday UI look and feel has been
    refreshed. The game library is now more flexible and powerful
    with further game customization settings and view options.
  * Multiplayer convenience: Clients will automatically download
    missing PWADs from the server before joining the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  8 14:37:03 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

Thu Dec 14 12:08:38 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new bugfix release 2.0.3
  * Server had crashed during startup with error messages related
    to threading
  * Non-standard C++ code had led to crash when using gcc7
  * Removed duplicate IWAD spec for Heretic 1.3 /
    Shadow of the Serpent Riders
  * Hexen: fix crash after returning to a different map in a hub
- Add doomsday-libs.diff, doomsday-notime.diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 20 12:07:26 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 2.0
  * The Home Screen replaces the front-end app. The Python-based
    Snowberry launcher application was created in 2005 and has been
    used for starting Doomsday ever since. In version 2.0, the
    launcher is no longer needed because Doomsday's Home Screen
    (previously called "ring zero") replaces its functionality.
  * Built-in support for packages. One of the launcher's key features
    was add-on management. This is now also part of Doomsday itself
    in the form of packages. Anything that Doomsday can load — WADs,
    resource packs, 3D models, etc. — is now handled via the same
    package management system. This enables Doomsday to track which
    files are in use in saved games and multiplayer games, and makes
    it possible to automatically ensure that the correct files are
    loaded at any given time.
  * New 3D model renderer. Doomsday's graphics code is undergoing a
    transition to a newer version of OpenGL, namely "OpenGL3/4 Core
    Profile"). Certain parts like the engine UI have already
    completed this transition, however the game renderer itself has
    not. In version 2.0, the new version of the 3D model renderer has
    reached a state where it is useful for actual gameplay. This new
    renderer supports FBX and MD5 models (among other formats),
    skeletal animation, GLSL shaders, and Doomsday Script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 18 07:53:52 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.15.8
* Custom episodes. Episode (DED) definitions specify the structure of
  game episodes (including hubs) enabling entirely new episodes and
  modifying the originals.
* MAPINFO support. MAPINFO (Hexen) definitions are now supported in
  Doom and Heretic, as well as Hexen. Note that, presently, only the
  Hexen dialect of MAPINFO is supported (ZDoom uses its own MAPINFO
  dialect).
* Adjustable pixel density. If your GPU is on the slower side, you
  can improve performance by reducing game view resolution. The rest
  of the UI remains sharp since the display mode is not changed. As a
  bonus, you can also get a nice nostalgic aesthetic similar to the
  original Doom on a CRT display.
- If you get a blank screen instead of the game title screen
  after selecting the IWAD to play, you may need to reset your
  settings (~/.doomsday)!
- Added doomsday-ncurses.diff (work around absence of ncurses.pc
  in not-too-new ncurses)

  tutorial notifications have been added to inform users of any
  important engine, map and resource errors and about the UI.
