  <title>DocBook Schemas (DTD, RELAX NG, W3C Schema) for Version 5.x</title>
  <description>The version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite of DocBook in RELAX NG.
The intent of this rewrite is to produce a schema that is true to the
spirit of DocBook while simultaneously removing inconsistencies that
have arisen as a natural consequence of DocBook's long, slow evolution.</description>
