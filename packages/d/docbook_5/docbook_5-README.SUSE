XML Catalog File
----------------

The main DocBook catalog is located in `/etc/xml/catalog.d/docbook_5.xml`.
However, in most cases you will point your catalog resolver to the file
`/etc/xml/catalog`.

The following URIs are supported and point to the same local path:

* http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/<DB_VERSION>/
* http://www.docbook.org/xml/<DB_VERSION>/
* http://docbook.org/xml/<DB_VERSION>/
* https://cdn.docbook.org/schema/<DB_VERSION>/

The structure of the DocBook schemas are shown in the following overview:

The significant differences from 5.1 to 5.2 are:

* Many new synopsis elements for programming languages.

* New transclusion fixup attributes.
* New class attribute on sectioning elements support legal sections.
* New meta element added to info.
* Added XInclude-enabled schema versions of Assembly and ITS schemas.
* Allow <info> as root element

DocBook V5.1
------------

DocBook is a general purpose schema particularly well suited to books and
papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no means
limited to these applications).

The Version 5.1 release introduces assemblies for topic-oriented authoring.
It also addresses a selection of bugs and feature requests. 

For further details, see the documentation in the package docbook_5-doc
