    if it's been over a day since we were supposed to back up.
  + Improve support for mobile screen sizes.
  + Add some in-preferences help explaining some of the
    always-ignored folders.
  + Bump default volume size from 25/50MB to 200MB, to keep fewer
    files around and improve network throughput.
  + Minor fixes to our experimental restic support (make sure
    to unlock the repo and warn if some files could not be read
    when backing up).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 20 12:31:39 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 43.3:
  + Change Google/Microsoft authentication flow to use a more

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 11:10:25 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

    file chooser.
  + Fix the "hostname has changed" dialog to let you actually
    continue the backup.
  + Fix a bogus notification that complained about not being
    connected to the network for scheduled backups to Network
    Servers, even if you were connected.
  + Make replacing existing monitor processes during upgrade work
    better.
  + Add a hidden advanced setting to run setup/teardown commands
    when running the backup tool (useful if you have an unusual
    manual mount you need).
  + Updated translations.
- Add 60856db.patch: fix test case ownership with latest valac.
- Add 9c17deb0526b.patch: add gtk wayland and x11 dep objects to
  deja-dup executable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  8 17:18:07 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 43.1:
  + Increase default window size to avoid being too small
  + Packaging: Require libsoup-3.0 (instead of libsoup-2.4)
- Changes from version 43.0:
  + This is a stable release, following 43.alpha and 43.beta in the
    GNOME style. Previously, odd number releases were the
    development releases, but no longer.
- Changes since 43.beta:
  + Fix the restore browser not asking any user questions during
    mount (like an invalid ssl cert)
  + Use dark mode if color schemes are not supported by the system,
    but the gtk theme is a dark variant
  + Minor UI spacing/style tweaks
  + Updated translations.
- New features since 42.x:
  + Add support for Microsoft OneDrive
  + Delay scheduled backups when Power Saver mode or GameMode are
    enabled
  + Add opt-in experimental support for using Restic
- Required packaging changes since 42.x:
  + Require libadwaita1 1.0+ (instead of libhandy1)
  + Require gtk4 4.6+ (instead of gtk3)
  + Require glib2 2.66+
  + Require meson 0.59+
  + Due to new support for Microsoft OneDrive: Require the
    requests_oauthlib python module: If you can't hard-depend on
    it, define the new requests_oauthlib_pkgs config flag if
    building with packagekit support. This feature will only be
    visible if duplicity 0.8.21+ is available.
- Optional Packaging Changes Since 42.x:
  + For experimental Restic support: New config flag enable_restic,
    which you can set to true to turn on the new experimental
    support for Restic. This will not use Restic by default, but
    merely expose a new "Labs" panel in the preferences window
    where users can opt-in. So it is safe to enable and helps us
    get feedback.
  + Require the restic and rclone packages
  + New config flags restic_pkgs and rclone_pkgs, if you can't
    hard-depend on the restic or rclone packages and are building
    with packagekit support
  + New config flags restic_command and rclone_command, where you
    can override the path to the restic and rclone executables
    (defaults to searching PATH).
- Drop cmake, libhandy-devel, pkgconfig(gtk-3.0) and
  pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4) BuildRequires. Add pkgconfig(gtk4),
  pkgconfig(libadwaita-1) and pkgconfig(libsoup-3.0) BuildRequires,
  and add python3-oauthlib Requires following upstream changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 13 22:31:01 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  * Fix restoring filenames with an apostrophe followed by a space
    (' ) in them
  * Always exclude ~/.cache, even if its not our current
    cache folder
  * Clarify deletion policy (that it can take up to three
    months longer than
    you might think) and allow a deletion policy of 3 months
    (previously 6 months was earliest allowed policy,
    which could mean up to 9 months)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 12:45:06 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 42.4 (boo#1197712):
  * Redesign the main window and preferences to follow GNOME

    backup/restore)
  * Add an in-app browse & restore interface
  * Drop nautilus plugin, in preference of above new
    browse interface

  * Use "Déjà Dup Backups" instead of "Déjà Dup Backup Tool"
    as full name

    which got broken during the 41.x development cycle
  * Automatically exclude folders that follow the cachedir spec
    (i.e. that have a CACHEDIR.TAG file in them), and same if
    they have a .deja-dup-ignore file
  * Use a symbolic back icon in header (vs a full color icon)
  * Stop the restore confirmation screen from growing too big
    if you are restoring a lot of files
  * Mount partitions specified in /etc/fstab if necessary
  * When selecting an internal drive as a Local Folder, treat it
    as a removable drive, so that we will mount if necessary
  * Exclude /dev by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  5 22:07:32 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

    few years though)
  + Support autostarting via the new Background portal
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 20:32:41 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add deja-dup-duplicity-Mark-GPGError-extern.patch: Mark GPGError
  as extern and prevent GPG symbols to be public API. Also fixes
  building with new vala.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  5 09:48:53 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 40.1:
  + Fix versioning to be correct.
- Changes from version 40.0:
  + Fix tests when run under glib 2.60
  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 39.1:
  + Fix a bug that could have caused backups to be encrypted with
    two different passwords in some cases. This would result in
    difficulty backing up or restoring by not accepting the
    password you expected it to.
  + Fix a bug that caused duplicate save or exclude folders to
    appear in the preferences.
  + Delete a canary file that duplicity's pydrive puts in your
    Drive.
  + If you don't ask for your password to be saved, we now clear
    out any older saved password.
  + Finally delete the ancient Ubuntu One backend code.
- Changes from version 39.0:
  + Switch away from GNOME Online Accounts to our own cloud keys:
    - It was brought to our attention that we shouldn't be using
      GNOME's keys, as they are intended for GNOME only.
    - Google accounts will have to be re-authenticated with our
      keys.
    - Nextcloud accounts will now appear as webdav network server
      accounts.
    - Adds new pydrive_pkgs option to list the package names needed
      for the pydrive duplicity backend (for now, the system
      package that provides the pydrive python2 package should
      suffice).
    - Adds new google_client_id option if you want to override our
      default account key and use your own. You likely won't want
      to do this.
    - Adds new dependencies on libjson-glib and libsoup.
    - Drops libgoa-backend dependency. The libgoa dependency will
      stay during a transition period from the old keys to the new
      keys.
  + Unmount a remote backup location when we are done with it, if
    we originally mounted it.
- Add pkgconfig(json-glib-1.0) and pkgconfig(libsoup-2.4)
  BuildRequires: New dependencies.
- Drop pkgconfig(goa-backend-1.0) BuildRequires: No longer needed,
  nor used.
- Reenable meson_tests, upstream fixed the issues.

  0.43.x.
- Disable meson_test, currently fails.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 17 17:23:57 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 38.3:
  + Allow restoring from paths with symlinks in more situations
    (including a fix for a backup error when ~/.cache is a
    symlink).
  + Treat operation dialogs more like real dialogs (modal to
    preference window, with correct styling on default buttons).
  + Try harder to stop running duplicity commands when we are
    terminated.
  + Don't hide an error message when also running our bimonthly
    backup verification.
  + If there isn't enough space in the backup location, tell the
    user how much is needed.
  + Exclude flatpak cache directories by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  7 15:55:22 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

  + Exclude snap cache directories by default.
  + Updated translations.
- Add gio-2.0, gio-unix-2.0 and goa-backend-1.0 pkgconfig modules
  and glib2-tools package BuildRequires to avoid implicit
  dependencies.
- Replace pkgconfig(appstream-builder), dbus-1-x11, update-desktop\
  -files and perl-gettext BuildRequires with appstream-glib, dbus-\
  1, desktop-file-utils and gettext-runtime respectively, what
  meson really looks for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 17 14:22:30 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add deja-dup-vala-0.36.patch: Fix build with vala 0.36. Patch is
  only applied when vala version 0.36 or newer is found (since
  upstream is not yet clear if they just want to require a new vala
  version or possibly support older ones too).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 26 09:33:55 UTC 2017 - firebird209@gmail.com

- Update to version 34.3:

    new full backup.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 13 13:49:47 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Fix deja-dup-help2man_stderr.patch: the introduction of
  --no-discard-stderr actually only hid the underlying issue:
  deja-dup is being started from the 'build' directory and its
  libraries are not yet installed. As a consequence, the ld loader
  can't find them, resulting in broken man pages. Change the patch
  to no longer pass --no-discard-stderr (same as upstream) but
  inject LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to find the two libs
  (boo#992499).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 24 10:56:00 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

    backup in GNOME.
  + Fix a bug where background backups were using smaller 'nice'
    values than they should have.
  + Drop support for building the GNOME Control Center plugin;
    upstream hasn't supported that for a while, and Ubuntu finally
    dropped their patch allowing it.
  + Install duplicity on demand if needed.
  + Support reproducible builds by using $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to set
    the man page timestamps, if present.
  + Updated translations.
- Add BuildRequires: pkgconfig(packagekit-glib2), needed for the
  install duplicity on demand feature.

      rpath support.
- Changes from version 29.1:
  + Bug Fixes: Detect encryption on existing backups by paying
    attention to what Duplicity tells us, rather than trying to
    figure it out by scanning ourselves. This removes a possible
    source of error.
  + Polish:
    - Rename to Backups (instead of Backup).
    - Update look and feel of preferences a bit.
    - Add screenshots to appdata file.
  + Packaging:

      --with-unity is now -DENABLE_UNITY. Otherwise, normal cmake
      conventions apply.

  + Build system adjustments
  + Updated translations.
- Add pkgconfig(libpea-1.0) BuildRequires: new dependency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 26 14:08:02 UTC 2012 - vuntz@opensuse.org

Tue Nov 22 15:02:09 UTC 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 21.2:
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Use smarter test for detecting whether existing backups are

      translations
    - Fix a bug that in some situations could lead to a full backup
      being created more frequently than once a month
  + Polish:
    - Drop "After a week" from "Keep backups" option, since
      internally, we always wait a month anyway
    - Treat any AssertionError by duplicity as an internal

      will let us be more pro-active about fixing some odd
      duplicity situations

    - Start of a unit test for our internal library; compile and
      run it with 'make check'

      to compile
    - No longer require libdbusmenu-gtk3 for Unity support
  + Updated translations.
- Add xz BuildRequires because we can't build a package for a
  xz-compressed tarball without explicitly specifying that... See
  bnc#697467 for more details.
- Disable parallel build as it breaks the build with this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 28 14:12:35 UTC 2011 - badshah400@gmail.com

    - Fix spacing and layout with latest versions of GTK+

      launcher by just not minimizing windows but instead showing
      them without stealing focus

Sat Feb 12 17:09:17 CET 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Call relevant macros in %post/%postun:

    least one desktop file.
  + %icon_theme_cache_post/postun because the package ships themed
    icons.

  can be packaged with the program, and not in the lang subpackage.
