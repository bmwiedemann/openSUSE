  <title>Simple backup tool and frontend for duplicity</title>
  <description>Déjà  Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of doing
backups the 'right way' (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses
duplicity as the backend.

Features:
 * Support for local or remote backup locations, including Amazon S3
 * Securely encrypts and compresses your data
 * Incrementally backs up, letting you restore from any particular backup
 * Schedules regular backups
 * Integrates well into your GNOME desktop</description>
