%description
Dateutils are a bunch of tools that revolve around fiddling with dates
and times in the command line with a strong focus on use cases that
arise when dealing with large amounts of financial data. Their target
market is shell scripts that need date calculations or calendar
conversions, and as such they are highly pipe-able and modeled after
their well-known cousins (e.g. dtest vs. test, or dgrep vs. grep).
