%description
Package Manager for the D Programming language.
DUB emerged as a more general replacement for vibe.d's package manager.
It does not imply a dependecy to vibe.d for packages and was extended to
not only directly build projects, but also to generate project files
(currently VisualD). Mono-D also support the use of dub.json
(dub's package description) as project file.
