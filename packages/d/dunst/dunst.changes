Mon Jan 16 20:47:25 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.9.0:
  * `override_dbus_timeout` setting to override the notification timeout set
    via dbus.
  * Support notification gaps via the `gap_size` setting. Note that since
    the notifications are not separate windows, you cannot click in between the
    notifications.
  * Make `min_icon_size` and `max_icon_size` a rule for even more
    flexibility
  * The window offset is now scaled according to `scale` as well. This way
    notification stay visually in the same place on higher DPI screens.
  * For the recursive icon lookup, revert to using `min_icon_size` and
    `max_icon_size` instead of `icon_size`. `min_icon_size` is used as the size to
    look for in icon themes.
  * Recursive icon lookup is no longer experimental.
  * Recursive icon lookup is enabled in the default dunstrc. This does not
    change your settings when you have a custom dunstrc.
  * Added back the `action_name` setting that was accidentally dropped.
  * Broken `dunstctl history`.
  * Merged a few wayland fixes from mako (https://github.com/emersion/mako)
    * `follow=keyboard`: Fix regression where we don't fall back to mouse
    * Raw icons not being scaled according to icon size
    * Notifications not disappearing. For some people notifications would
      sometimes stay on screen until a new notification appeared. This should
      not happen anymore
