  <title>Disk-Based Hash Library</title>
  <description>Disk-based hashes is a method to create multidimensional binary trees
on disk. This library permits the extension of the database concept to
a plethora of electronic data, such as graphic information. With the
multidimensional binary tree, it is possible to mathematically prove
that access time to any particular record is minimized (using the
concept of critical points from calculus), which provides the means to
construct optimized databases for particular applications.</description>
