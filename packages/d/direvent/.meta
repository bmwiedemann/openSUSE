  <title>Monitor a file system directory for changes</title>
  <description>GNU Direvent monitors events in the file system directories. For each event
that occurs in a set of pre-configured directories, the program calls an
external program associated with it, supplying it with the information about
the event and the location within the file system where it occured.
