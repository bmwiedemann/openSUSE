    - The pydrive backend had another of the ongoing bytes/string
      issues. :)
  + Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/resume-encrypt-no-pass
    - This branch arose from a Debian patch that has been disabling
      the encryption validation of volume1 during restarts for

    - Fixed so bytes filenames were compared as unicode in re.match()
  + Fixed bug #1849661 with patch from Graham Cobb
    - The problem is that b2backend uses 'quote_plus' on the

      '/'. Note that 'quote' defaults 'safe' to '/', but
      'quote_plus' does not!
  + Added additional fsdecode's to uses of local_path.name and
    source_path.name in b2backend's _get() and _put.  See bug
    #1847885 for more details.

    - While doing multipart upload to s3 we need to report the
      total size of uploaded data, and not the size of each part
      individually.  So we need to keep track of all parts
      uploaded so far and sum it up on the fly.
  + Fixed bug #1848203 with patch from Michael Apozyan
    - convert to integer division
  + Updated b2 backend to work with both v0 and v1 of b2sdk
  + Fixed bug #1847885 - B2 fails on string concatenation.
    - use util.fsdecode() to get a string not bytes.
      - Partially fixed in bug #1843995, this applies same fix to
      remaining instances of the problem
  + Fixed Resouce warnings when using paramiko.  It turns out
    that duplicity's ssh_paramiko_backend.py was not handling
    warning suppression and ended up clearing all warnings,
    including those that default to off.

Tue Jul 16 01:31:53 UTC 2019 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.8.01: 
    * Comment out HSIBackendTest since shim is not up-to-date.
    * Merged in po-updates.
    * Make sure test filenames a bytes not unicode.
    * Fix test_glob_to_regex to work on Python 3.7
    * Fix warning in _librsync.c module.
    * Add encoding to logging.FileHandler call to make log file
      utf8
    * Ensure _librsync.so is regenned before tox testing.
    * Adjust POTFILES.in for compilec.py move.
    * Fix so we start duplicity with the base python we run under.
    * Fix some issues found by test_code.py.
    * Normalize shebang to just python, no version number
    * Fix so most testing/*.py files have the future suggested
      lines
      - from __future__ import print_function
        from future import standard_library
        standard_library.install_aliases()
    * Merged lp:~mterry/duplicity/boto-import
      - A couple functions in the boto backend were using the boto
      module without importing it first.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/s3fsdecode
      - Fix s3 backups by encoding remote filenames
    * Fix reimport problem where "from future.builtins" was being
      treated the differently than "from builtins".  They are both
      the same, so converted to shorter form "from builtins" and
      removed duplicates.
    * Fixed bug #1833573 0.8.00 does not work on Python 2
      - Fixed shebang to use /usr/bin/python instead of python
    * Fixed bug #1833559 0.8 test fails with 'duplicity not found'
      errors
      - Fixed assumption that duplicity/rdiffdir were in $PATH
    * Fixed failing test in testing/unit/test_globmatch.py
      - Someone is messing with regex.  Fix same.
      - See https://bugs.python.org/issue29995 for details
    * Fix some import conflicts with the "past" module
      - Rename collections.py to dup_collections.py
      - Remove all "from future.utils import old_div"
      - Replace old_div() with "//" (in py27 for a while).
      - All tests run for py3, unit tests run for py2.  The new
        import fail is "from future import standard_library"
    * Fixed bug #1831178 sequence item 0: expected str instance,
      int found
      - Simply converted int to str when making list
    * Merged in lp:~kaffeekiffer/duplicity/azure-python3-fix
      - Use util.fsencode to encode file string
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/uexc-string
      - The return type of util.uexc should always be a string.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gio-pydrive-fsdecode
      - Fix gio and pydrive backends to use fsdecode
    * See CHANGELOG for changes in version 0.8.00
- Drop duplicity-refresh-collections-status.patch: fixed upstream.

- Adjust dependencies, build, and files to use python 3
  (bsc#1082695).
- Add python3-pytest-runner to BuildRequires.
- Adjust egg-info line in files: the directory name doesn't
  precisely match the version name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 20 09:10:55 UTC 2019 - mgorse@suse.com

- Add duplicity-refresh-collections-status.patch: refresh
  collections status after sync (lp#1828869). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 10:54:15 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.7.19:
  * Fixed bug #1798206 and bug #1798504
    - Made paramiko a global with import during __init__ so it would
      not be loaded unless needed.
  * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pydrive-root-0.7
    - Just a tiny fix to clean up the temporary file we create to find the root ID.
      It's a little surprising for the user if they wind up with this file called
      "i_am_in_root" that they don't know where it came from. Almost sounds like
      they were hacked.
  * Merged in lp:~yajo/duplicity/duplicity
    - Support partial metadata sync.
    - Fixes bug #1823858 by letting the user to choose partial syncing.
      Only the metadata for the target chain will be downloaded. If older
      (or newer) chains are encrypted with a different passphrase, the user will
      be able to restore to a given time by supplying only the
      passphrase for the chain selected by the `--restore-time` option
      when using this new option.
    - A side effect is that using this flag reduces dramatically the
      sync time when moving files from one to another location, in
      cases where big amounts of chains are found.
- Update duplicity-remove_shebang.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 19 10:38:23 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

  * Partial fix of bug #1734144 with patch from Joris van Eijden
    - Note: this is really just a partial fix for now, since it only covers
      the case where the local size does not yet match the remote size.  A
      case where -1 is the returned length is not fixed.
    - Number of retries is now same as globals.num_retries.
    - Added standoff delay of 0.5 sec per attempt.
  * Fixed bug #1764432 with patch from Robke Geenen
    - Just join the parts together.
  * Fixed bug #1717935 with suggestion from strainu
    - Use urllib.quote_plus() to properly quote pathnames passed via URL

- update to 0.7.14
  * collection-status should not sync metadata
    syncing metadata might require to download several GBs
  * Fixed slowness in 'collection-status' by basing the status on the
    remote system only.  The local cache is treated as empty.
  * Fixed encrypted remote manifest handling to merely put out a non-fatal
    error message and continue if the private key is not available.
  * giobackend: handle a wider variety of gio backends by making
    less assumptions; in particular, this fixes the google-drive: backend
  * Fixed PEP8 errors in bin/duplicity
  * gio: be slightly more correct and get child GFiles based on display name
  * log.Warn was invoked with log.warn in webdavbackend.py

  * Fixed man page that had 'cancel' instead of 'loopback' for
    pinentry mode
  * Fixed bug #1684312

    If gpg binary is specified rebuild gpg profile using new binary location
  * Fixed bug #1658283 "Duplicity 0.7.11 broken with GnuPG 2.0"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 09:25:25 UTC 2017 - wr@rosenauer.org

- update to 0.7.11
  * Changed default --volsize to 200MB
  * Backblaze announced a new domain for the b2 api
  * Fixes Bug #1620085: --exclude-if-present gives OSError looking
    for tag in locked folders
  * GPG: enable truly non-interactive operation with gpg2
  * Do backup to google drive working without a service account
  * Added new command line option --backend-retry-delay
    that allows to determine the time that duplicity sleeps
    before retrying after an error has occured.
  * Added some robustness to dpbxbackend.py that ensures re-authentication
    happens in case that a socket is changed (e.g. due to a forced reconnect
    of a dynamic internet connection).
  * Add --copy-links to copy symlink contents, not just the link itself.
  * Fixed Bug #1624725, so that an include glob ending in "/" now
    includes folder contents (for globs with and without special
    characters). This preserves the behaviour that an expression
    ending in "/" only matches a folder, but now the contents of
    any matching folder is included.
  * If stat() returns None, don't attempt to set perms.
  * if a space is entered while duplicity asks for the URL, it fails.
    Since all important spaces are URL encoded anyway, this should
    be fine even if there are spaces in the URL at all. I also
    patched it in the onedrive backend, because it must have similar
    issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 23 07:40:58 UTC 2016 - wr@rosenauer.org

    - Revert log.Error to log.Warn, as it was prior to the merge in rev 1224,
      as this was affecting other applications (e.g. deja dup; Bug #1605939).
  * Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates

- update to 0.7.06
  * This adds support for AWS S3's newly announced Infrequent Access
    storage class and is intended to implement Blueprint:
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/aws-s3-std-ia-class
  * A new command line option, --s3-use-ia, is added, and boto backend
    will automatically use the correct storage class value depending on
    whether --s3-use-rrs and --s3-use-ia is set. Command line parser will
    prompt error if both --s3-use-ia and --s3-use-rrs are used together,
    as they conflict with each other.
  * Upgrade to newest version of pep8 and pylint
  * WindowsAzureMissingResourceError and WindowsAzureConflictError
    changed due to SDK changes.
  * make sure packages using python's tempfile create temp files in
    duplicity's temp dir

  * Added --s3-use-multiprocessing to select the new s3

    verification prompt anymore, symmetric passphrases are
    still verified
  * Fixed Unicode errors when translations are used.

- Apply fix for http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?23985
  --no-encryption option does no more work with duplicity 0.4.12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 24 22:04:48 CEST 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.4.12
  * Dan Muresan created a patch to minimize the number of password
    prompts.  To do so, it sometimes requests a password once without
    confirmation; if later it turns out that a full backup is needed,
    the user is prompted for confirmation.
  * bug #23540: doc bug in man page (environment FTP_PASSWORD)
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?23540
  * bug #23362: Documentation for --version, --time-separator <char>
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?23362
  * bug #23283: interactive passphrase query is suboptimal
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?23283
  * bug #23066 was not actually applied to 0.4.11.  Its here now.
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?23066
  * bug #22826: regressions caused by boto 1.1c
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?22826
- changes in 0.4.11
  * Changes applied to allow duplicity to run under Python 2.3 again.
  * patch #6485: Reinstate patch #6340 with a detailed explanation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 17 13:41:21 CEST 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.4.10
  * bug #22728: FTP backend fails on empty directory
  * patch #6374: Duplicity --tempdir patch documentation.
  * patch #6375: Duplicity reports the epoch for a nonexistant last full
    backup date
  * patch #6380: add additional named logging levels
  * patch #6389: Possible Fix for pagefile.sys on Win32 systems
  * patch #6403: Restore by overwriting files/directories by using --force
    option
  * patch #6449: add additional debug level logging
  * patch #6453: handle absolute urls in webdav backend
  * Fix problem where S3 prefix was prepended with 'd'.  This caused a
    failure in the regression tests.
- changes in version 0.4.9
  * NOTE: URL format correction in rsync://.  The rsync backend
    now properly supports absolute and relative pathnames and 
    module access.  The formats are:
      rsync://user@host::/module/some_dir
      rsync://user@host/relative_path
      rsync://user@host//absolute_path
  * Fixed regression caused by changeover to new urlparse.py.
  * bug #21475: FTP Usernames that contain '@' are not recognized
  * Added section URL FORMAT in the duplicity man page.
  * Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
    Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.
  * Fixed so that remove-older-than and remove-all-but-n-full
    will not request a GPG passphrase.
  * Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty directory
    listing and thus force a full backup every time.  A side effect of the
    change is that we now only make one call to ncftpls to get the listing,
    thereby reducing the overhead on systems with a large number of backup
    files.
  * bug #21896: Two problems with rsync under 0.4.8 + patch
  * bug #21909: Problematic typo in compare_verbose() method
  * patch #6354: S3 staight typo results in a bogus exception
  * patch #6356: Command line option for the temporary directory root.
  * patch #6357: Explicit restore action is missing from the command list,
- changes in version 0.4.8
  * First pass at bringing unittest cases up to date.  All unit tests are
    working, but more test cases need to be added to handle the new
    protocols, plus there is some print leakage even with logging turned
    off.
  * Allow pexpect to force the close of the child on sftp calls.  We already
    do that with scp calls.  This cleans up that exception.
  * bug #21751: rsync module urls do not work in 0.4.7
  * bug #21752: Boto backend needs version 0.9d or later
  * patch #6340: S3 short filename regression
  * patch #6344: S3 bad bad key key handling
- changes in version 0.4.7
  * Applied patch from Eric Hanchrow to fix logging error in botoBackend,
    and fix delete() in rsyncBackend.
  * bug #21673: remove-all-but-n-full wrong arg usage
  * bug #21686: NcFTPGet 3.2.0 tempfile incompatibility
  * patch #6292: Amazon S3 bucket creation deferral
  * patch #6293: left-over patch from remove-all-but-n-full
  * patch #6296: Generic S3 url support for Duplicity 0.4.6
  * patch #6298: URI unquoting patch for FTP backend
  * patch #6299: re-design tempfile handling
  * patch #6300: Standard library replacement for ParsedUrl class
  * patch #6301: log sftp commands at verbosity 5

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 17:08:49 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.4.6
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21508
    bug #21508: Change delete implementation of ftpBackend to 
    only send one "DELE" instead of multiple per delete.
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21646
    bug #21646: --archive-dir causes delete of remote full
    sigs and orphaned sig files
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21651
    bug #21651, add https support for webdav.
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21657
    bug #21657: ncftpls fails to create dir in ver 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6284
    patch #6284: document TMPDIR and friends
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6284
    patch #6285: security fix: eliminate use of mktemp()
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?6289
    patch #6289: Amazon S3 key prefix patch for Duplicity 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?6291
    patch #6291: Alternative WebDAV HTTPS patch
- changes in 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21646
    Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.  Prior to
    this, duplicity would write the full sig files to both local and remote,
    then delete the remote.  Now, it does not delete the remote full sigs.
  * Applied the following patches from Peter Schuller
    patch #6279, add command 'remove-all-but-n-full'
    patch #6280, clarify --archive-dir option
    patch #6281, --help should print to stdout, not stderr
    patch #6282, collection-status: output in more consistent order
- changes in 0.4.4
  * Changes to ftpBackend to use a temp login config file rather than
    putting the username and password on the command line.  This requires
    the use of NcFTP 3.1.9 or later.
  * Thanks to a patch from Greg Hewgill the Amazon S3 backend now uses
    --num-retries to retry IO repeatedly if needed.
  * Changes to commandline processing to allow non-ambiguous short strings
    for commands, i.e. 'i', 'inc', 'incr' for 'incremental', 'f' for 'full',
    etc..  A warning message is printed if the short command is not unique. 
    Note: this already works for options, so I just applied the same idea to
    commands.
  * Applied a patch from Gregory Hartman to correct handling of DST
    in time calculations.  This affects backups made the night of
    a DST time switch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  7 12:34:26 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 0.4.3
  * Move get_password() to Backend class to standardize.
  * Fix problem with ftpBackend to create target directory if needed.  Note:
    this creates only one level.
  * Dropped ssh-command and added ssh-options to allow users to add options
    to the scp and sftp commmands.
  * Removed use of tempfile.TemporaryFile().  This fixes the restore problem
    on Windows that was due to Python bug 1776696 reported on Sourceforge.
  * Fixed Debian Bug#437694: Make bzip2 compression optional.  The default
    is not to do bzip2 compression.  To use bzip2 add the following command
    line option: --gpg-options='--compress-algo=bzip2
    --bzip2-compress-level=9' Note: do not add spaces in the string value.
  * Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend. 
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764
  * Remove ssh_command option, add ssh_options.  This adds options to the
    scp and sftp commands that are used by the ssh backend.
  * Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when using sftp.  This
    allows it to run under cron as long as the password is supplied
    non-interactively.
  * Change ssh backend to not pass :port part of URL to scp or sftp.  We
    already supply -oPort=xx for port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 23:25:39 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- initial package (version 0.4.2)
