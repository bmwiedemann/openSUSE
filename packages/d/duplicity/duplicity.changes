  + Fixed bug #1851167 with help from Aspen Barnes
    - Had Popen() to return strings not bytes.
  + Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pydrive-cache-fix
    - The pydrive backend had another of the ongoing bytes/string
      issues. :)
  + Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/resume-encrypt-no-pass
    - This branch arose from a Debian patch that has been disabling
      the encryption validation of volume1 during restarts for
      years. Debian has been preserving the ability to back up
      with just an encrypt key and no password (i.e. to have no
      secrets on the backup machine).

    - Encode to utf8 only on Python2, otherwise leave as unicode.

- Update to version 0.8.06: 
  + Merged in translation updates

    since py2.
  + Revisited bug #1848783 - par2+webdav raises TypeError on Python 3
    - Fixed so bytes filenames were compared as unicode in re.match()
  + Fixed bug #1849661 with patch from Graham Cobb
    - The problem is that b2backend uses 'quote_plus' on the
      destination URL without specifying the 'safe' argument as
      '/'. Note that 'quote' defaults 'safe' to '/', but
      'quote_plus' does not!
  + Added additional fsdecode's to uses of local_path.name and
    source_path.name in b2backend's _get() and _put.  See bug
    #1847885 for more details.
  + Fixed bug #1848166 - Swift backend fails on string concat
    - added util.fsdecode() where needed
  + Fixed bug #1848783 with patch from Jacob Middag
    - Don't use byte strings in regex
  + Fixed bug #1626061 with patch from Michael Apozyan
    - While doing multipart upload to s3 we need to report the
      total size of uploaded data, and not the size of each part
      individually.  So we need to keep track of all parts
      uploaded so far and sum it up on the fly.
  + Fixed bug #1848203 with patch from Michael Apozyan
    - convert to integer division
  + Updated b2 backend to work with both v0 and v1 of b2sdk
  + Fixed bug #1847885 - B2 fails on string concatenation.
    - use util.fsdecode() to get a string not bytes.
      - Partially fixed in bug #1843995, this applies same fix to
      remaining instances of the problem
  + Fixed Resouce warnings when using paramiko.  It turns out
    that duplicity's ssh_paramiko_backend.py was not handling
    warning suppression and ended up clearing all warnings,
    including those that default to off.

        standard_library.install_aliases()
    * Merged lp:~mterry/duplicity/boto-import
      - A couple functions in the boto backend were using the boto

      - Fix s3 backups by encoding remote filenames
    * Fix reimport problem where "from future.builtins" was being
      treated the differently than "from builtins".  They are both
      the same, so converted to shorter form "from builtins" and

    * Fixed bug #1833573 0.8.00 does not work on Python 2
      - Fixed shebang to use /usr/bin/python instead of python

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 20 09:10:55 UTC 2019 - mgorse@suse.com

- Add duplicity-refresh-collections-status.patch: refresh
  collections status after sync (lp#1828869). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 30 10:54:15 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.7.19:
  * Fixed bug #1798206 and bug #1798504
    - Made paramiko a global with import during __init__ so it would
      not be loaded unless needed.
  * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pydrive-root-0.7
    - Just a tiny fix to clean up the temporary file we create to find the root ID.
      It's a little surprising for the user if they wind up with this file called
      "i_am_in_root" that they don't know where it came from. Almost sounds like
      they were hacked.
  * Merged in lp:~yajo/duplicity/duplicity
    - Support partial metadata sync.
    - Fixes bug #1823858 by letting the user to choose partial syncing.
      Only the metadata for the target chain will be downloaded. If older
      (or newer) chains are encrypted with a different passphrase, the user will
      be able to restore to a given time by supplying only the
      passphrase for the chain selected by the `--restore-time` option
      when using this new option.
    - A side effect is that using this flag reduces dramatically the
      sync time when moving files from one to another location, in
      cases where big amounts of chains are found.
- Update duplicity-remove_shebang.patch

  * collection-status should not sync metadata
    syncing metadata might require to download several GBs
  * Fixed slowness in 'collection-status' by basing the status on the
    remote system only.  The local cache is treated as empty.
  * Fixed encrypted remote manifest handling to merely put out a non-fatal
    error message and continue if the private key is not available.
  * giobackend: handle a wider variety of gio backends by making
    less assumptions; in particular, this fixes the google-drive: backend

    If gpg binary is specified rebuild gpg profile using new binary location
  * Fixed bug #1658283 "Duplicity 0.7.11 broken with GnuPG 2.0"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 09:25:25 UTC 2017 - wr@rosenauer.org

- update to 0.7.11
  * Changed default --volsize to 200MB
  * Backblaze announced a new domain for the b2 api
  * Fixes Bug #1620085: --exclude-if-present gives OSError looking
    for tag in locked folders
  * GPG: enable truly non-interactive operation with gpg2
  * Do backup to google drive working without a service account
  * Added new command line option --backend-retry-delay
    that allows to determine the time that duplicity sleeps
    before retrying after an error has occured.
  * Added some robustness to dpbxbackend.py that ensures re-authentication
    happens in case that a socket is changed (e.g. due to a forced reconnect
    of a dynamic internet connection).
  * Add --copy-links to copy symlink contents, not just the link itself.
  * Fixed Bug #1624725, so that an include glob ending in "/" now
    includes folder contents (for globs with and without special
    characters). This preserves the behaviour that an expression
    ending in "/" only matches a folder, but now the contents of
    any matching folder is included.
  * If stat() returns None, don't attempt to set perms.
  * if a space is entered while duplicity asks for the URL, it fails.
    Since all important spaces are URL encoded anyway, this should
    be fine even if there are spaces in the URL at all. I also
    patched it in the onedrive backend, because it must have similar
    issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to 0.7.06
  * This adds support for AWS S3's newly announced Infrequent Access
    storage class and is intended to implement Blueprint:
    https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/aws-s3-std-ia-class
  * A new command line option, --s3-use-ia, is added, and boto backend
    will automatically use the correct storage class value depending on
    whether --s3-use-rrs and --s3-use-ia is set. Command line parser will
    prompt error if both --s3-use-ia and --s3-use-rrs are used together,
    as they conflict with each other.
  * Upgrade to newest version of pep8 and pylint
  * WindowsAzureMissingResourceError and WindowsAzureConflictError
    changed due to SDK changes.
  * make sure packages using python's tempfile create temp files in
    duplicity's temp dir

    usable in earlier versions.

  * Usability enhancement: sign passphrase prompt has no second
    verification prompt anymore, symmetric passphrases are
    still verified
  * Fixed Unicode errors when translations are used.
  * Replaced old tarfile.py with Python 2.7 version, modded
    to support Python 2.4 syntax.

  * Dan Muresan created a patch to minimize the number of password
    prompts.  To do so, it sometimes requests a password once without

    the user is prompted for confirmation.

- changes in version 0.4.9
  * NOTE: URL format correction in rsync://.  The rsync backend
    now properly supports absolute and relative pathnames and 
    module access.  The formats are:
      rsync://user@host::/module/some_dir
      rsync://user@host/relative_path
      rsync://user@host//absolute_path
  * Fixed regression caused by changeover to new urlparse.py.
  * bug #21475: FTP Usernames that contain '@' are not recognized
  * Added section URL FORMAT in the duplicity man page.
  * Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
    Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.
  * Fixed so that remove-older-than and remove-all-but-n-full
    will not request a GPG passphrase.
  * Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty directory
    listing and thus force a full backup every time.  A side effect of the
    change is that we now only make one call to ncftpls to get the listing,
    thereby reducing the overhead on systems with a large number of backup
    files.
  * bug #21896: Two problems with rsync under 0.4.8 + patch
  * bug #21909: Problematic typo in compare_verbose() method
  * patch #6354: S3 staight typo results in a bogus exception
  * patch #6356: Command line option for the temporary directory root.
  * patch #6357: Explicit restore action is missing from the command list,
- changes in version 0.4.8
  * First pass at bringing unittest cases up to date.  All unit tests are
    working, but more test cases need to be added to handle the new
    protocols, plus there is some print leakage even with logging turned
    off.
  * Allow pexpect to force the close of the child on sftp calls.  We already
    do that with scp calls.  This cleans up that exception.
  * bug #21751: rsync module urls do not work in 0.4.7
  * bug #21752: Boto backend needs version 0.9d or later
  * patch #6340: S3 short filename regression
  * patch #6344: S3 bad bad key key handling
- changes in version 0.4.7
  * Applied patch from Eric Hanchrow to fix logging error in botoBackend,
    and fix delete() in rsyncBackend.
  * bug #21673: remove-all-but-n-full wrong arg usage
  * bug #21686: NcFTPGet 3.2.0 tempfile incompatibility
  * patch #6292: Amazon S3 bucket creation deferral
  * patch #6293: left-over patch from remove-all-but-n-full
  * patch #6296: Generic S3 url support for Duplicity 0.4.6
  * patch #6298: URI unquoting patch for FTP backend
  * patch #6299: re-design tempfile handling
  * patch #6300: Standard library replacement for ParsedUrl class
  * patch #6301: log sftp commands at verbosity 5

- update to version 0.4.6
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21508
    bug #21508: Change delete implementation of ftpBackend to 
    only send one "DELE" instead of multiple per delete.
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21646
    bug #21646: --archive-dir causes delete of remote full
    sigs and orphaned sig files
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21651
    bug #21651, add https support for webdav.
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21657
    bug #21657: ncftpls fails to create dir in ver 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6284
    patch #6284: document TMPDIR and friends
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6284
    patch #6285: security fix: eliminate use of mktemp()
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?6289
    patch #6289: Amazon S3 key prefix patch for Duplicity 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?6291
    patch #6291: Alternative WebDAV HTTPS patch
- changes in 0.4.5
  * https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21646
    Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.  Prior to
    this, duplicity would write the full sig files to both local and remote,
    then delete the remote.  Now, it does not delete the remote full sigs.
  * Applied the following patches from Peter Schuller
    patch #6279, add command 'remove-all-but-n-full'
    patch #6280, clarify --archive-dir option
    patch #6281, --help should print to stdout, not stderr
    patch #6282, collection-status: output in more consistent order
- changes in 0.4.4
  * Changes to ftpBackend to use a temp login config file rather than
    putting the username and password on the command line.  This requires
    the use of NcFTP 3.1.9 or later.
  * Thanks to a patch from Greg Hewgill the Amazon S3 backend now uses
    --num-retries to retry IO repeatedly if needed.
  * Changes to commandline processing to allow non-ambiguous short strings
    for commands, i.e. 'i', 'inc', 'incr' for 'incremental', 'f' for 'full',
    etc..  A warning message is printed if the short command is not unique. 
    Note: this already works for options, so I just applied the same idea to
    commands.
  * Applied a patch from Gregory Hartman to correct handling of DST
    in time calculations.  This affects backups made the night of
    a DST time switch.

- update to version 0.4.3
  * Move get_password() to Backend class to standardize.
  * Fix problem with ftpBackend to create target directory if needed.  Note:
    this creates only one level.
  * Dropped ssh-command and added ssh-options to allow users to add options
    to the scp and sftp commmands.
  * Removed use of tempfile.TemporaryFile().  This fixes the restore problem
    on Windows that was due to Python bug 1776696 reported on Sourceforge.
  * Fixed Debian Bug#437694: Make bzip2 compression optional.  The default
    is not to do bzip2 compression.  To use bzip2 add the following command
    line option: --gpg-options='--compress-algo=bzip2
    --bzip2-compress-level=9' Note: do not add spaces in the string value.
  * Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend. 
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764
  * Remove ssh_command option, add ssh_options.  This adds options to the
    scp and sftp commands that are used by the ssh backend.
  * Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when using sftp.  This
    allows it to run under cron as long as the password is supplied
    non-interactively.
  * Change ssh backend to not pass :port part of URL to scp or sftp.  We
    already supply -oPort=xx for port.
