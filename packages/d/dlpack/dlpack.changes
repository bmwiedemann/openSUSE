- Update to 0.6:
  * Changelog:
    Add kDLROCMHost
    Add kDLCUDAManaged
  * from 0.5:
    Rename enum names:
      kDLGPU -> kDLCUDA
      kDLCPUPinned -> kDLCUDAHost
    The ABI is backward compatible, as it is only change of
    constant name, exchange can still happen between the new version
    and old version.
  * from 0.4:
    OpaqueHandle type
    Complex support
    Rename DLContext -> DLDevice
    DLTensor.ctx -> DLTensor.device
    This requires dependent frameworks to upgrade the type name.
    The ABI is backward compatible, as it is only change of constant
    name, exchange can still happen between the new version and old version.
