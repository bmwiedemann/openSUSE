- Update to 1.1:
  * Added support for F8
  * Added support for F4
  * Added support for F6
- Skipped 1.0:
  * Introduce versioning DLManagedTensorVersioned
  * flags about exported tensor
  * This release acompanies array api changes, see the note below
    Starting Python array API standard v2023, a new max_version
    argument is added to __dlpack__ for the consumer to signal the
    producer the maximal supported DLPack version. Starting DLPack
    1.0, the DLManagedTensorVersioned struct should be used and
    the existing DLManagedTensor struct is considered deprecated,
    though a library should try to support both during the
    transition period if possible.

- Update to 0.6:
  * Changelog:
    Add kDLROCMHost
    Add kDLCUDAManaged
  * from 0.5:
    Rename enum names:
      kDLGPU -> kDLCUDA
      kDLCPUPinned -> kDLCUDAHost
    The ABI is backward compatible, as it is only change of
    constant name, exchange can still happen between the new version
    and old version.
  * from 0.4:
    OpaqueHandle type
    Complex support
    Rename DLContext -> DLDevice
    DLTensor.ctx -> DLTensor.device
    This requires dependent frameworks to upgrade the type name.
    The ABI is backward compatible, as it is only change of constant
    name, exchange can still happen between the new version and old version.
