%description
DLPack is an open in-memory tensor structure to for sharing tensor among frameworks. DLPack enables:
 * Easier sharing of operators between deep learning frameworks.
 * Easier wrapping of vendor level operator implementations, allowing collaboration when introducing new devices/ops.
 * Quick swapping of backend implementations, like different version of BLAS
 * For final users, this could bring more operators, and possibility of mixing usage between frameworks.
