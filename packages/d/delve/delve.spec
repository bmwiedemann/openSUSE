%description
Delve is a debugger for the Go programming language. The goal of
the project is to provide a simple, full featured debugging tool
for Go. Delve should be easy to invoke and easy to use. Chances are
if you're using a debugger, things aren't going your way. With that
in mind, Delve should stay out of your way as much as possible.
