%description
dd_rhelp is a bash helper script that handles dd_rescue. dd_rescue roughly acts
as the dd linux command with the caracteristic to NOT stop when it falls on
read/write.

dd_rhelp intelligently controls dd_rescue to first copy all blocks from areas
that work and only then tries to approach the bad spots from both sides.
