  + modify to work with ncurses' threaded-library, which does not allow
    assignment to LINES/COLS (report by Marcus Roeckrath).
  + correct clearing after text in progressbox from 2018/06/21 changes
    for resizing (reports by David Boyd, Alan Somers).
  + improved configure macros CF_GNU_SOURCE, CF_POSIX_C_SOURCE,
    CF_XOPEN_SOURCE
  + update config.guess, config.sub
- Includes also version 1.3-20181107
  + convert ja.po to UTF-8 for consistency (suggested by Stanislav
    Brabec).
  + repair mis-encoded hi.po (report/analysis by Stanislav Brabec).
- Includes also version 1.3-20181022
  + improved configure macros CF_CC_ENV_FLAGS, CF_LD_RPATH_OPT,
    CF_LIBRARY_PATH, CF_SHARED_OPTS, CF_WITH_MAN2HTML,
    CF_WITH_VERSIONED_SYMS from ncurses
  + add ast.po, from
          http://translationproject.org/latest/dialog/
- Includes also version 1.3-20180621
  + improve file-offset computation in textbox.c (Werner Fink).

    height or width is given as -1.
  + build-fixes for configure options "--disable-Xdialog2" and
    "--disable-form"
  + add traces for each widget to show its parameters.
  + modify color scheme for mixedgauge to use the dialog window colors,

  + fix a too-small malloc in the mixedgauge widget.
  + fix a use-after-free in dlg_remove_callback().
  + improve handling of SIGWINCH for several widgets (Debian #865840).
    + menubox, the point of the Debian report was that it would be nice
      to increase the window size if the terminal size increases.  Did
      that as a special case less problematic than decreasing the
      terminal size.  Added samples/menubox11 to demonstrate by
      comparison with menubox10 a problem with debconf which puts extra
      newlines in the caption that interfere with autowrap.
    + progressbox and derived prgbox, programbox, now handle resizing.
    + yesno, window was cleared
  + add dlg_ttysize() to support new options, allowing scripts to obtain
    some text-formatting details without initializing the terminal.
  + add options --print-text-only, and --print-text-size for scripts that
    adjust the widget size according to how the captions are formatted.
  + improve dialog.pl:
    + add demo.pl, to demonstrate the functions
    + quote/escape string parameters passed to dialog.
    + ensure all "integer" parameters are really integers.
    + use actual screensize for list captions rather than assuming 24
      lines.
  + when trimming blanks, treat unconverted tabs the same as spaces.
  + correct parameter to test when trimming blanks from the script,
    e.g., with "--trim" (report by Jarno Suni).
  + improve documentation of the various whitespace-filtering options,
    to show which take precedence (Debian #867536, cf: Debian #102942).
  + modify msgbox.c, yesno.c to bind SCROLLKEY_BINDINGS before
    TRAVERSE_BINDINGS so that up/down arrow will by default scroll the
    message up/down rather than be aliases for tab-traversal (report by
    Fredrik Kers).
  + modify dump_one_binding() to show when a binding is overridden.
  + improve format of trace-file, making comment-syntax consistent,
    as well as showing argv-splitting as a series of comments.
  + modify dlg_string_to_argv() to change the quoting behavior to be
    more consistent with shell behavior (patch by Denilson Sa Maia).
  + modify dlg_getc() to return ESC when a timeout expires, notifying
    callers that a quit occurred rather than exiting the application
    (suggested by Rodrigo Freitas).
  + modify handle_inputs() to ensure cursor-visibility is restored when
    there is no input character available (report by Guillaume Vareille).
  + improve comment in manual page regarding which widgets can use the
    "--help-button" (prompted by discussion with Csanyi Pal).
  + add a check for valid object pointer in tailbox's main loop since
    the getc-callback may have been freed within ui_getc.c (report by
    "David").
  + improved configure macros for ncurses: CF_GNU_SOURCE, CF_SHARED_OPTS,
    CF_CURSES_LIBS, CF_CURSES_FUNCS, CF_NCURSES_CONFIG
  + improved configure script checks for groff vs man2html: 
    CF_PROG_GROFF and CF_WITH_MAN2HTML
  + build-fix from lynx for AM_WITH_NLS configure macro
  + update config.guess, config.sub

	option work.

  * modify makefile to apply CFLAGS to linking
  * modify dlg_string_to_argv() to ignore escaped newlines except when
    quoted, fixing a problem with samples/checklist9.

    using "--file" by changing dialog_opts[] to an array of pointers to
    the expanded argv[] (discussion with Lars Tauber).
  * modified autoconf macros
    + CF_CC_ENV_FLAGS amend the last change to move only the
      preprocessor, optimization and warning flags to CPPFLAGS and

  * modify editbox widget to add a trailing newline if the text 
    has none to ensure the last line is not ignored (report by 
    Florent Rougon).

    than button-clicks, for better response.
  * modify dump_curses_key() to show mouse-coding in readable form.
  * correct mapping of mouse-clicks on the day-grid in calendar 
    widget when "--week-start" is used to set the start of the week

    discussion with Stefan Vogtner).
  * add a limit-check in editbox.c to ensure that mouse-clicks

  + update configure macros for improved coding style from lynx changes.
  + updated ro.po from
          http://translationproject.org/latest/dialog/
  + update config.guess, config.sub
  > patches by Florent Rougon:
  + fix two bugs in the "--file" option.
    + When the number of arguments read from the included file is 0, the
      code used to just skip over '--file' and its argument instead of
      removing them from the argument list, causing "Error:  Unknown
      option --file" later on.
    + In the alternative case (at least one argument read from the file),
      the previous code used to do '--j;' in order to "force rescan" of
      the inserted arguments.  However, control then flowed to outer
      blocks where a '++j;' counteracted this measure, causing "Error:
      Unknown option --msgbox" (for instance) later on.
  + modify escaping in argv.c to be more uniform, whether or not the
    backslash is found within a parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 08:05:24 UTC 2015 - werner@suse.de

- Update to version 1.2-20150225
  + modify gauge widget to keep from erasing a second gauge widget, e.g.,
    via the "--and-widget" option.  This is a cosmetic change to match
    behavior of dialog 1.0 (report by Jason Orendorf).
  + add configure option "--with-man2html"
  + add configure options for versioned symbols, from ongoing work on
    ncurses.
  + update configure macros, e.g., for shared libraries
- Changes from 1.2- 20150125
  + suppress highlighting of character which denotes an abbreviation or
    shortcut for the OK/Cancel and other buttons for these widgets, which
    use abbreviations for the list shown on the screen:  buildlist,
    checklist/radiobox, menubox, treeview (Debian #775295).
  + add grid up/left and down/right bindings in editbox.c as synonyms for
    field prev and next, respectively when handling the OK/Cancel buttons
    (Debian #775294).

    consistently from help- and help-item button results rather than
    getting the item's text for the latter
  + correct manpage discussion of DIALOG_ITEM_HELP versus --item-help,
    as well as --help-button return status
  + correct limit used for --hline option
  + do not print empty "[]" if a --hline option was given with an empty
    value
  + miscellaneous configure script fixes/updates.  In particular, add
    option --with-shared which builds shared libraries without a libtool
    dependency.
  + add FreeBSD port-files for test-builds.

    http://translationproject.org/latest/dialog/
  + update config.guess, config.sub

    wide-character ncursesw headers with the ncurses library
  + correct workaround for xterm alternate-screen to work with/without
    the fix made in ncurses that makes putp() always write to the
    standard output (Debian #708829).
  + improve limit-checks for checklist, in case the dialog is resized
  + add --last-key option ( Debian #697607).
- Changes from 2013/03/15
