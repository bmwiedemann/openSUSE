  <title>Delta Filesystem</title>
  <description>Deltafs combines a read-only lower directory and a read-write upper
directory into a new filesystem.  Currently it works very similarly to
a union filesystem, where upon modification whole files are copied up
to the upper layer.  There are plans to store differences more
efficiently in the future.</description>
