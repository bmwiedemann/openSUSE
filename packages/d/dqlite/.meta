  <title>Embeddable, replicated, and fault-tolerant SQL engine</title>
  <description>dqlite is a C library that implements an embeddable and replicated SQL database engine with high-availability and automatic failover.

The acronym &quot;dqlite&quot; stands for &quot;distributed SQLite&quot;, meaning that dqlite extends SQLite with a network protocol that can connect together various instances of your application and have them act as a highly-available cluster, with no dependency on external databases.</description>
