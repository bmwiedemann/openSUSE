   Breaking changes
  ==================

  After discussing with several users, we noticed that quite a lot
  of them were not aware that enabling the dnsdist’s console
  without a key, even restricted to the local host, could be a
  security issue and allow privilege escalation by allowing an
  unprivileged user to connect to the console and execute Lua code
  as the dnsdist user. We therefore decided to refuse any
  connection to the console until a key has been set, so please
  check that you do set a key before upgrading if you use the
  console.

   New features
  ==================

  The DNS over TLS feature introduced in 1.3.0 was missing the
  ability to support both an RSA and an ECDSA certificate at the
  same time, and it was not possible to switch to a new certificate
  without restarting dnsdist. This has now been fixed.

  The packet cache has also been improved in this release, with the
  addition of a negative TTL option to be able to specify how long
  NODATA and NXDOMAIN answers should be cache, as well as a way to
  dump the content of the cache. We also made the detection of ECS
  collisions more robust, preventing two queries for the same name,
  type and class but a different ECS subnet from colliding even if
  they did hash to the same value.

  This version gained the ability to insert dynamic rules that do
  nothing, and do not stop the processing of subsequent rules,
  which is very useful for testing purposes. The optimized
  DynblockRulesGroup introduced in 1.3.0 also gained the ability to
  whitelist and blacklist ranges from dynamic rules, for example to
  prevent some clients from ever being blocked by a rate-limiting
  rule.

  Finally, we introduced the new SetECSAction directive to be able
  to force the ECS value sent to a downstream server for some or
  all queries.

   Bug fixes
  ===========

  In addition to various documentation and cosmetics fixes, a few
  annoying bugs have been fixed in this release:

  - If the first connection attempt to a given backend failed,
    dnsdist didn’t properly reconnect even when the backend became
    available ;
  - Dynamic blocks were sometimes created with the wrong duration ;
  - The ability to iterate over the results of the Lua exceed*()
    functions was broken in 1.3.0, preventing manual whitelisting
    from Lua ;
  - Some statistics were displayed with too many decimals in the
    web interface ;
  - A backend outstanding queries counter could become wrong if it
    dropped a lot of queries for a while.

  * Add missing QPSAction.
  * Don't create a Remote Logger in client mode.
  * Keep the TCP connection open on cache hit, generated answers.
  * Add the missing <sys/time.h> include to mplexer.hh for struct timeval.
  * Sort the servers based on their 'order' after it has been set.
  * Fix the outstanding counter when an exception is raised.

- enable snmp support (new BR: net-snmp-devel)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 16:15:43 UTC 2017 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 1.2.0 (boo#1054799, boo#1054802)
  This release also addresses two security issues of low severity,
  CVE-2016-7069 and CVE-2017-7557. The first issue can lead to a
  denial of service on 32-bit if a backend sends crafted answers,
  and the second to an alteration of dnsdist’s ACL if the API is
  enabled, writable and an authenticated user is tricked into
  visiting a crafted website. More information can be found in our
  security advisories 2017-01 and 2017-02.

  - applying rules on cache hits
  - addition of runtime changeable rules that matches IP address for a
  - certain time: TimedIPSetRule
  - SNMP support, exporting statistics and sending traps
  - preventing the packet cache from ageing responses when deployed in
  - front of authoritative servers
  - TTL alteration capabilities
  - consistent hash results over multiple deployments
  - exporting CNAME records over protobuf
  - tuning the size of the ringbuffers used to keep track of recent
  - queries and responses
  - various DNSCrypt-related fixes and improvements, including
  - automatic key rotation

  Users upgrading from a previous version should be aware that:

  - the truncateTC option is now off by default, to follow the
    principle of least astonishment
  - the signature of the addLocal() and setLocal() functions has
    been changed, to make it easier to add new parameters without
    breaking existing configurations
  - the packet cache does not cache answers without any TTL
    anymore, to prevent them from being cached forever
  - blockfilter has been removed, since it was completely redundant

  This release also deprecates a number of functions, which will be
  removed in 1.3.0. Those functions had the drawback of making
  dnsdist’s configuration less consistent by hiding the fact that
  each rule is composed of a selector and an action. They are still
  supported in 1.2.0 but a warning is displayed whenever they are
  used, and a replacement suggested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 30 01:43:23 UTC 2016 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 1.1.0
  dnsdist 1.1.0 has seen a significant amount of development,
  mostly based on feedback from they many 1.0 deployments. The
  majority of the new features have already been taken into
  production by pre-release and beta users.

  Highlights include:

  - TeeAction: send responses to a second nameserver, but ignore
    responses. Used to test new installations on existing traffic.
    Also used by the Yeti rootserver project.
  - Response rules which act on received responses
  - AXFR/IXFR support, including filtering options
  - Linux kernel based query type and query name filtering (eBPF),
    for very high speed packet rejection. Includes counters and
    statistics
  - Query counting infrastructure (contributed by TransIP’s Reinier
    Schoof)

  For the many other new features, improvements and bug fixes,
  please see the dnsdist website for the more complete changelog
  and the current documentation.
