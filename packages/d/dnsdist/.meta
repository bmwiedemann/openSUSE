  <title>A highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer</title>
  <description>dnsdist is a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer. Its goal in life
is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance to
legitimate users while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.

dnsdist is dynamic, in the sense that its configuration can be changed at
runtime, and that its statistics can be queried from a console-like interface.
