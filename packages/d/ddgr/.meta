  <title>DuckDuckGo from the terminal</title>
  <description>A cmdline utility to search DuckDuckGo from the terminal. Similar to googler for Google.

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search results you would like to see per page. It's more convenient than skimming through 30-odd search results per page. The default interface is carefully designed to use minimum space without sacrificing readability.
