# Sample DHCPv6 configuration file for ISC dhcpd

# *** PLEASE CONFIGURE IT FIRST ***
#
# Don't forget to set the DHCPD6_INTERFACE in the
# /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd file.

# Define RFC 4833 timezone options:
#
#option dhcp6.rfc4833-tz-posix-string code 41 = string;
#option dhcp6.rfc4833-tz-name code 42 = string;
#
# Use example:
#   option dhcp6.rfc4833-tz-posix-string "EST5EDT4,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00";
#   option dhcp6.rfc4833-tz-name         "Europe/Zurich";
