- Complete the /var/run -> /run migration by renaming
  /var/lib/dhcp/var/run accordingly (boo#1177951).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 14:55:25 UTC 2020 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Don't create dhclient.leases in %post. It affects transactional
  updates and the files don't need to pre-exist (boo#1129951).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 13:52:57 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop dependency on insserv-compat

  It was required to call the rc_status helpers from the sysvinit
  scripts. These scripts are supposed to be called by systemd, which
  has its own mechanism to report service status.

  Please note that this package still needs to be converted to ship
  proper systemd units.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 12:56:11 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- /var/run is legacy -> /run should be used instead

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 29 07:11:52 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- The server package still requires insserv-compat: the .service
  files only call out to legacy sysv init scripts that are still
  sourcing /etc/rc.status (boo#1173440).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 23 15:22:00 UTC 2020 - Cristian Rodríguez <crrodriguez@opensuse.org>

- insserv is not required anymore

- Fixes for %_libexecdir changing to /usr/libexec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 15 06:32:20 UTC 2020 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- Use sysusers.d instead of shadow

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  2 17:26:39 UTC 2020 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- Add -fcommon to CFLAGS to fix build with gcc10 (boo#1160262).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 06:12:51 UTC 2020 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- Change remaining systemd requires to weak dependencies, too.
- Don't require net-tools with SLE15 or newer, it does not contain
  anything anymore we need
- Get ride of coreutils dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 15 15:18:59 UTC 2019 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- bsc#1134078, CVE-2019-6470, dhcp-CVE-2019-6470.patch:
  DHCPv6 server crashes regularly.
- Add compile option --enable-secs-byteorder to avoid duplicate
  lease warnings [bsc#1089524].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  2 16:50:48 CEST 2019 - kukuk@suse.de

- Make systemd a weak dependency as we don't want that in a container

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 28 12:38:32 UTC 2019 - Reinhard Max <max@suse.com>

- bsc#1136572: Use IPv6 when called as dhclient6, dhcpd6, and
  dhcrelay6 (0021-dhcp-ip-family-symlinks.patch).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  8 12:19:53 UTC 2019 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- dhclient-script: replace host(1) with getent, which is more
  lightweight (part of glibc and does not pull in bind-utils)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 06:58:43 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 18:13:36 UTC 2019 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Remove SuSEfirewall2 services since SuSEfirewall2 has been
  replaced by firewalld (which already provides a service for
  dhcp).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 10 09:06:07 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add workaround to require insserv-compat until the package is
  converted to full systemd units (boo#1133632).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 22 07:04:56 UTC 2019 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Drop use of $FIRST_ARG in .spec

  The use of $FIRST_ARG was probably required because of the
  %service_* rpm macros were playing tricks with the shell positional
  parameters. This is bad practice and error prones so let's assume
  that no macros should do that anymore and hence it's safe to assume
  that positional parameters remains unchanged after any rpm macro
  call.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 21 13:33:47 UTC 2019 - Jonathan Brielmaier <jbrielmaier@suse.de>

- Remove wrong path to documentation in the description of the
  server package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  5 08:57:34 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Drop doc subpackage as we do not build on < SLE12 anyway so it
  evaluated always as true
- Do not condition flags settings for codestreams that we are no
  longer building for
- Use %license macro for license as mandated by new TW requirements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  4 19:53:43 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Format with spec-cleaner (automatic, remove FIXMEs)
- Use getent to detect created user prior doing it again
- Drop ldapcasa as it evaluates as false on all current products
- Drop ldap conditional as it is always true

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  4 19:46:20 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Kill omc configs wrt fate#301838

- Update to dhcp-4.3.6-P1:
  * CVE-2018-5733, bsc#1083303: reference count overflow in dhcpd.
  * CVE-2018-5732, bsc#1083302: buffer overflow bug in dhclient.
  * Plugged a socket descriptor leak in OMAPI
  * The server now allows the client identifier (option 61) to own
    leases in more than one subnet concurrently [ISC-Bugs #41358].
  * When replying to a DHCPINFORM, the server will now include
    options specified at the pool scope, provided the ciaddr field
    of the DHCPINFORM is populated.
    [ISC-Bugs #43219] [ISC-Bugs #45051].
  * When memory allocation fails in a repeated way the process
    writes "Run out of memory." on the standard error and exists
    with status 1  [ISC-Bugs #32744].
  * The new lmdb (Lightning Memory DataBase) bind9 configure
    option is now disabled by default to avoid the presence of
    this library to be detected which can lead to a link failure.
    [ISC-Bugs #45069]
  * The linux interface discovery code has been modified to use
    getifaddrs() as is done for BSD and OS-X.
    [ISC-Bugs #28761] and others.
  * Fixed a bug in OMAPI that causes omshell to crash when a
    name-value pair with a zero length value is shipped in an
    object [ISC-Bugs #29108].
  * On 64-bit platforms, dhclient now generates the correct value
    for the script environment variable, "expiry", the lease
    expiry value exceeds 0x7FFFFFFF [ISC-Bugs #43326].
  * Common timer logic was modified to cap the maximum timeout
    values at 0x7FFFFFFF - 1 [ISC-Bugs #28038].
  * DHCP6 FQDN option unpacking code now correctly handles values
    that contain spaces, special, or non-printable characters.
    [ISC-Bugs #43592]
  * When running in -6 mode, dhclient can enforce the require
    option statement and will discard offered leases that do not
    contain all the required options specified in the client
    configuration [ISC-Bugs #41473].
  * Altered DHCPv4 lease time calculation to avoid roll over
    errors on 64-bit OS systems when using -1 or large values
    for default-lease-time [ISC-Bugs #41976],
  * Added --dad-wait-time parameter to dhclient [ISC-Bugs #36169].
  * The server nows checks both the address and length of a
    prefix delegation when attempting to match it to a prefix
    pool [ISC-Bugs #35378].
  * Modified DDNS support initialization such that DNS related
    ports will only be opened by the server (dhcpd) at startup
    if ddns-update-style is not "none"; by dhclient only if and
    when the it first attempts an update; and never by dhcrelay.
    [ISC-Bugs #45290] [ISC-Bugs #33377]
  * Added error logging to two memory allocation failure checks.
    [ISC-Bugs #41185]
  * Corrected a dhclient -6 issue that caused the client to crash
    with an "Impossible condition" error after de-preferencing its
    only IA binding [ISC-Bugs #44373].
  * By defining CALL_SCRIPT_ON_ONETRY_FAIL in includes/site.h,
    dhclient will now call the script with reason set to FAIL when
    run with -1 (one try) and there are no server responses.
    [ISC-bugs #18183]
  * The server now detects failover peers that are not referenced
    in at least one pool when run with the command line option for
    test mode, -T [ISC-Bugs #29892].
  * Linux script updated [ISC-bugs #19430] [ISC-bugs #18111].
  * Changed severity of the log message indicating UDP checksum
    errors in the received packets from 'info' to 'debug'.
    [ISC-bugs #41757]
  * Corrected a bug which could cause the server to sporadically
    crash while loading lease files with the lease-id-format is
    set to "hex" [ISC-Bugs #43185].

  stops the service immediately after starting 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 13 15:52:25 UTC 2017 - mchandras@suse.de

- Drop old sysvinit support from the spec file. All the supported
  openSUSE distributions are systemd based so there isn't much point
  in keeping sysvinit support and files around.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 23 13:49:18 UTC 2017 - rbrown@suse.com

- Replace references to /var/adm/fillup-templates with new 
  %_fillupdir macro (boo#1069468)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 14 09:48:25 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Replace net-tools Requires in dhcp-client with hostname on
  suse_version >= 1330 (CODE15): net-tools does no longer provide
  any tool referenced by dhclient-script, but we require hostname
  (which is also a dependency to net-tools, thus hiding the issue).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 12:27:59 UTC 2017 - bwiedemann@suse.com

- use .gz year instead of current one to make build reproducible

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  6 16:17:18 CEST 2017 - ndas@suse.de

- fixed a typo in nis-servers option name breaking the config file introduced
  in previous change to workaround issues in NetworkManager parser.
- Update to dhcp-4.3.5

  - Corrected a bug which could cause the server to sporadically crash while
    loading lease files with the lease-id-format is set to "hex".  Our thanks
    to Jay Ford, University of Iowa for reporting the issue.
    [ISC-Bugs #43185]
  - Eliminated a noisy, but otherwise harmless debug log statment that may
    appear during server startup when building with --enable-binary-leases
    and configuring multiple pools in a shared network.  Thanks to Fernando
    Soto from BlueCat Networks for reporting the issue and supplying a patch.
    [ISC-Bugs #43262]
  - Fixed util/bindvar.sh error handling.
    [ISC-Bugs #41973]
  - Correct error message in relay to use remote id length instead
    of circuit id length.
    [ISC-Bugs #42556]
  - Add logic to test directory Makefiles to avoid copying Attfile(s)
    when building within the source tree.  This eliminates a noisy but
    otherwise harmless error message when running "make check".
    [ISC-Bugs #41883]
  - Leases are now scrubbed of certain prior use information when pool
    re-balancing reassigns them from one FO peer to the other.  This
    corrects an issue where leases that were offered but not used
    by the client retained the client hostname from the original
    client. Thanks to Pavel Polacek, Jan Evangelista Purkyne University
    for reporting the issue.
    [ISC-Bugs #42008]
  - In the LDAP code and schema add some missing '6' characters to use
    the v6 instead of the v4 versions.  Thanks to Denis Taranushin for
    reporting this issue and supplying its patch.
    [ISC-Bugs #42666]
  - Correct how the pick-first-value expression is written to a lease
    file.  Previously it was written as a concat expression due to
    a cut and paste error.
    [ISC-Bugs #42253]
  - Modify the DDNS code to clean up the PTR record even if there
    are issues while cleaning up the A or AAAA records.
    [ISC-Bugs #23954]
  - Added global configuration parameter, abandon-lease-time, which determines
    the amount of time a lease remains abandoned.  The default is 84600 seconds.
    Additionaly, the server now conducts a ping check (if ping checks are
    enabled) prior to offering an abandoned lease to client.  Our thanks to
    David Zych at University of Illinois for reporting the issue and working
    with us to produce a viable solution.
    [ISC-Bugs #41815]
  - Correct handling of interface names during interface discovery. This
    addresses an issue where interface names of 15 characters in length
    could lead to crashes or interface recognition errors during startup
    of dhcpd, dhclient, and dhcrelay.
    [ISC-Bugs #42226]
  - Updates to contrib/dhcp-lease-list.pl to make it more friendly.
    The updates are: looking for the lease file in more places and skipping
    the "processing complete" output when creating machine readable
    output.  Thanks to Cameron Paine (cbp at null dot net) for the
    patch.
    [ISC-Bugs #42113]
  - When reusing a lease for dhcp-cache-threshold return the hostname
    to the original lease.  Also if the host pointer, UID or hardware address
    change don't allow reuse of the lease.
    Thanks to Michael Vincent for reporting this and helping us
    verify the problem and fix.
    [ISC-Bugs #42849]
  - Change dmalloc to use a size_t as the length argument to bring it
    in line with the call it will make to malloc().
    [ISC-Bugs #40843]
  - If the failover socket can't be bound, close it.  Otherwise if the
    user configures an incorrect address in the failover stanza the
    server will continue to open new sockets every 90 seconds until
    it runs out.
    [ISC-Bugs #42452]
  - Add DHCPv4-mode, dhcrelay command line options, "-iu" and "-id", that
    allow interfaces to be upstream or downstream respectively.  Upstream
    interfaces will accept and forward only BOOTP replies, while downstream
    interfaces will accept and forward only BOOTP requests.
    [ISC-Bugs #41547]
  - Clean up some memory references in the vendor-class construct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 19 10:37:25 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Use /usr/sbin/arping instead of /sbin/arping in the dhcp scripts.
  /sbin/arping is a symlink to /usr/sbin/arping in order to ease the
  transition for the /usr merge. Newest releases of iputils may only
  install utilities in /usr/* so this dependency will no longer be valid.
  Moreover, we replace the '/sbin/arping' dependency with 'iputils'.

- Fixed server to not report success before send (bsc#919959)
  [+ 0017-server-no-success-report-before-send.919959.patch]
- Fixed dhclient to check pre-init results reported by dhclient-script

- Update to ISC dhcp-4.2.5 release. See RELNOTES file for the
  complete list of changes -- digest of fixes not in dhcp-4.2.4-P2:
  - Correct code to calculate rebind timing values in client
    [ISC-Bugs #29062]
  - Fix some issues in the code for parsing and printing options.
    [ISC-Bugs #22625,#27289,#27296,#27314]
  - Update the memory leakage debug code to work with v6.
    [ISC-Bugs #30297]
  - Relax the requirements for deleting an A or AAAA record.
    This relaxation was codified in RFC 4703. [ISC-Bugs #30734]
  - Modify the failover code to handle incorrect peer names better.
    [ISC-Bugs #30320]
  - Fix a set of issues that were discovered via a code inspection
    tool. [ISC-Bugs #23833]
  - Parsing unquoted base64 strings improved. [ISC-Bugs #23048]
  - The client now passes information about the options it requested
    from the server to the script code via environment variables.
    These variables are of the form requested_<option_name>=1 with
    the option name being the same as used in the new_* and old_*
    variables. [ISC-Bugs #29068]
  - Check the status value when trying to read from a connection to
    see if it may have been closed.  If it appears closed don't try
    to read from it again.  This avoids a potential busy-wait like
    loop when the peer names are mismatched. [ISC-Bugs #31231]
  - Remove an unused variable to keep compilers happy.
    [ISC-Bugs #31983]
- Removed obsolete parsing and printing option patch
  [dhcp-4.2.4-parsing-and-printing-options.patch]
- Merged dhcp-4.2.2-dhclient-send-hostname-rml.diff
  [dhcp-4.2.5-dhclient-send-hostname-rml.patch]
- Fixed discovery of interfaces, which have only addresses with
  a label assigned (linux 2.0 "alias interfaces" compatibility)
  by switching to use the getifaddrs() as on BSD (bnc#791289,
  reported upstream as [ISC-Bugs #31992]).
  [dhcp-4.2.4-interface-discovery-using-getifaddrs.patch]
- Applied a patch to ignore SIGPIPE instead to die in socket code
  before the errno==EPIPE checks are reached (bnc#794578, upstream
  report [ISC-Bugs #32222])
  [dhcp-4.2.4-P2-do-not-die-on-sigpipe.patch]
- Updated ldap patch to 4.2.5-ldap-mt01 providing following fixes:
  - Fixed parse buffer handling code to not avoid truncation of
    config > ~8k from bigger ldap objects. Fixed to free the ldap
    config buffer passed to the config parser and append new config,
    while the parser is in saved state (bnc#788787).
  - Fixed subclass name-ref and data quoting/escaping (bnc#788787).
  - Fixed memory leaks on ldap_read_config errors (bnc#788787).
  - Fixed a memleak while subnet range processing, fixed to reset
    bufix variable in ldap_read_function to 0 and to set buflen to
    the complete length (do not discard last character, usually \n).
    This caused a parsing error at further run of the function,
    e.g. while processing the second dhcpService container that the
    dhcpServer object may refer to (bnc#784640).
  [dhcp-4.2.5-ldap-mt01.patch.bz2]
- Fixed dhclient-script to discard MTU lower-equal 576 rather
  than lower-than (bnc#791280).
- Verify GPG source archive signatures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 20 12:26:53 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to ISC dhcp-4.2.4-P2 release, providing a security fix for
  an issue with the use of lease times was found and fixed.  Making
  certain changes to the end time of an IPv6 lease could cause the
  server to abort.  Thanks to Glen Eustace of Massey University,
  New Zealand for finding this issue.
  ([ISC-Bugs #30281], CVE: CVE-2012-3955, bnc#780167)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 25 18:13:59 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to ISC dhcp-4.2.4-P1 release, providing following security
  fixes (bnc#772924):
  - Previously the server code was relaxed to allow packets with zero
    length client ids to be processed.  Under some situations use of
    zero length client ids can cause the server to go into an infinite
    loop. As such ids are not valid according to RFC 2132 section 9.14
    the server no longer accepts them.  Client ids with a length of 1
    are also invalid but the server still accepts them in order to
    minimize disruption.  The restriction will likely be tightened in
    the future to disallow ids with a length of 1.
    Thanks to Markus Hietava of Codenomicon CROSS project for the
    finding this issue and CERT-FI for vulnerability coordination.
    [ISC-Bugs #29851] CVE: CVE-2012-3571
  - When attempting to convert a DUID from a client id option
    into a hardware address handle unexpected client ids properly.
    Thanks to Markus Hietava of Codenomicon CROSS project for the
    finding this issue and CERT-FI for vulnerability coordination.
    [ISC-Bugs #29852] CVE: CVE-2012-3570
  - A pair of memory leaks were found and fixed.  Thanks to Glen
    Eustace of Massey University, New Zealand for finding this issue.
    [ISC-Bugs #30024] CVE: CVE-2012-3954
- Moved lease file check to a separate action so it is not used in
  restart -- it can fail when the daemon rewrites the lease causing
  a restart failure then (bnc#762108 regression).
- Request dhcp6.sntp-servers in /etc/dhclient6.conf and forward to
  netconfig for processing (bnc#770236).
- Removed RFC 4833 TZ options from client requests [unused].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 19 06:40:03 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Update to ISC dhcp-4.2.4 release, fixing a dhcpv6 server assert
  crash while accessing lease on heap (bnc#767661) and providing
  the following fixes:
  - Rotate the lease file when running in v6 mode.
    Thanks to Christoph Moench-Tegeder at Astaro for the
    report and the first version of the patch. [ISC-Bugs #24887]
  - Fixed the code that checks if an address the server is planning
    to hand out is in a reserved range.  This would appear as the
    server being out of addresses in pools with particular ranges.
    [ISC-Bugs #26498]
  - In the DDNS code handle error conditions more gracefully and
    add more logging code. The major change is to handle unexpected
    cancel events from the DNS client code. [ISC-Bugs #26287]
  - Tidy up the receive calls and eliminate the need for found_pkt.
    [ISC-Bugs #25066]
  - Add support for Infiniband over sockets to the server and
    relay code.  We've tested this on Solaris and hope to expand
    support for Infiniband in the future.  This patch also corrects
    some issues we found in the socket code. [ISC-Bugs #24245]
  - Add a compile time check for the presence of the noreturn attribute
    and use it for log_fatal if it's available.  This will help code
    checking programs to eliminate false positives. [ISC-Bugs #27539]
  - Fixed many compilation problems ("set, but not used" warnings) for
    gcc 4.6 that may affect Ubuntu 11.10 users. [ISC-Bugs #27588]
  - Modify the code that determines if an outstanding DDNS request
    should be cancelled.  This patch results in cancelling the
    outstanding request less often.  It fixes the problem caused
    by a client doing a release where  the TXT and PTR records
    weren't removed from the DNS. [ISC-BUGS #27858]
  - Use offsetof() instead of sizeof() to get the sizes for
    dhcpv6_relay_packet and dhcpv6_packet in several more places.
    Thanks to a report from Bruno Verstuyft and Vincent Demaertelaere
    of Excentis. [ISC-Bugs #27941]
  - Remove outdated note in the description of the bootp keyword about
    the option not satisfying the requirement of failover peers for
    denying dynamic bootp clients. [ISC-bugs #28574]
  - Multiple items to clean up IPv6 address processing. When processing
    an IA that we've seen check to see if the addresses are usable
    (not in use by somebody else) before handing it out.
    When reading in leases from the file discard expired addresses.
    When picking an address for a client include the IA ID in
    addition to the client ID to generally pick different addresses
    for different IAs. [ISC-Bugs #23138] [ISC-Bugs #27945]
    [ISC-Bugs #25586] [ISC-Bugs #27684]
  - Remove unnecessary checks in the lease query code and clean up
    several compiler issues (some dereferences of NULL and treating
    an int as a boolean). [ISC-Bugs #26203]
  - Fix the NA and PD allocation code to handle the case where a client
    provides a preference and the server doesn't have any addresses or
    prefixes available.  Previoulsy the server ignored the request with
    this patch it replies with a NoAddrsAvail or NoPrefixAvail response.
    By default the code performs according to the errata of August 2010
    for RFC 3315 section 17.2.2; to enable the previous style see the
    section on RFC3315_PRE_ERRATA_2010_08 in includes/site.h.
    This option may be removed in the future. Thanks to Jiri Popelka at
    Red Hat for the patch. [ISC-Bugs #22676]
  - Fix up some issues found by static analysis. A potential memory leak
    and NULL dereference in omapi. The use of a boolean test instead of
    a bitwise test in dst. [ISC-Bugs #28941]
- Replaced our patches with a complete and upstream verified patch:
  - Fix some issues in the code for parsing and printing options.
    [ISC-Bugs #27314] - properly parse a zero length option from
    a lease file.
    [ISC-Bugs #22796] - properly determine if we parsed a 16 or
    32 bit value in evaluate_numeric_expression (extract-int).
    [ISC-Bugs #22625] - properly print options that have several
    fields followed by an array of something for example "fIa"
    [ISC-Bugs #27289] - properly parse options in declarations
    that have several fields followed by an array of something
    for example "fIa"
  This patch obsoletes the following (bnc#739696) patches:
  - dhclient: parse_option_param: Bad format a
  - zero-length option lease parse error in dhclient6
- Merged ldap and options check patches for the new version
- Fixed dhcp-server init script to check syntax and fail while
  force-reload and restart to avoid stopping of running daemon
  followed by start failure (bnc#762108). Added libgcc_s.so to
  chroot, so the server can report assert/crash line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 28 15:06:47 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Added RFC 4833 TimeZone PosixString and Name declarations to
  server and client configs [not used yet].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 09:37:52 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- dhcp-server: fixed to escape all values used in constructed
  ldap filters as a DN may contain e.g. asterisks (bnc#721829,
  [ISC-Bugs #28545]).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 15:26:43 UTC 2012 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to ISC dhcp-4.2.3-P2 release, providing a DDNS security fix:
  Modify the DDNS handling code. In a previous patch we added logging
  code to the DDNS handling.  This code included a bug that caused it
  to attempt to dereference a NULL pointer and eventually segfault.
  While reviewing the code as we addressed this problem, we determined
  that some of the updates to the lease structures would not work as
  planned since the structures being updated were in the process of
  being freed: these updates were removed.  In addition we removed an
  incorrect call to the DDNS removal function that could cause a failure
  during the removal of DDNS information from the DNS server.
  Thanks to Jasper Jongmans for reporting this issue.
  ([ISC-Bugs #27078], CVE: CVE-2011-4868, bnc#741239)
- Fixed close-on-exec patch to not set it on stderr (bnc#732910)
- Fixed incorrect "a" array type option parsing causing to discard
  e.g. classless static routes from lease file [reported as ISC-Bug
  27289] and zero-length option parsing such as dhcp6.rapid-commit
  in dhclient6 [reported as ISC-Bug 27314] (bnc#739696).
- Fixed dhclient to include its pid number in syslog messages.
- Fixed to use P2 in the spec version, not in the release tag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  9 13:40:53 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.com

- Updated to ISC dhcp-4.2.3-P1 release, providing security fix for
  a DoS due to processing certain regular expressions (bnc#735610)
  and several important DDNS related fixes:
  * Add a check for a null pointer before calling the regexec function.
    Without out this check we could, under some circumstances, pass
    a null pointer to the regexec function causing it to segfault.
    Thanks to a report from BlueCat Networks. [ISC-Bugs #26704]
    CVE-2011-4539.
  * Fix the code that checks for an existing DDNS transaction to
    cancel when removing DDNS information, so that we will continue
    with the processing if we have a lease even if it doesn't have an
    outstanding transaction.  [ISC-Bugs #24682]
  * Add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac to avoid rebuilding
    configuration files.  [ISC-Bugs #24107]
  * Add support for passing DDNS information to a DNS server over
    an IPv6 address.  [ISC-Bugs #22647]
  * Enhanced patch for 23595 to handle IPv4 fixed addresses more
    cleanly.  [ISC-Bugs #23595]

  variables to /etc/dhcpd.d and /etc/dhcpd6.d by default, so there
  are well-defined directories expected to contain additional config
  files (bnc#690585).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 29 15:15:44 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC dhcp-4.2.2 release, providing two security fixes
  (CVE-2011-2748,CVE-2011-2749,[ISC-Bugs #24960],bnc#712653), that
  allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (a daemon
  exit) via crafted BOOTP packets. Further also DNS update fix to
  detect overlapping pools or misconfigured fixed-address entries,
  that caused a server crash during DNS update and other fixes.
  For a complete list, please see the RELNOTES file provided in
  the package and also available online at http://www.isc.org/.
- Merged/adopted dhclient option-checks, send-hostname-rml, ldap
  patch, xen-checksum, close-on-exec patches and removed obsolete
  in6_pktinfo-prototype and relay-no-ip-on-interface patches.
- Moved server pid files into chroot directory even chroot is
  not used and create a link in /var/run, so it can write one
  when started as user without chroot and avoid stop problems
  when the chroot sysconfig setting changed (bnc#712438).
- Disabled log-info level messages in dhclient(6) quiet mode to
  avoid excessive logging of non-critical messages (bnc#711420).
- Fixed dhclient-script to not remove alias IP when it didn't
  changed to not wipe out iptables connmark when renewing the
  lease (bnc#700771). Thanks to James Carter for the patch.
- Fixed DDNS-howto.txt reference in the config file; it has been
  moved to the dhcp-doc package (bnc#697279).
- Removed GPL licensed files (bind-*/contrib/dbus) from bind.tgz
  to ensure, they're not used to build non-GPL dhcp (bnc#714004).
- Changed to apply strict-aliasing/RELRO for >= 12.x only

Tue May 10 11:48:57 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed to not introduce separate dhcp-doc package on sles,
  use versioned provides/obsoletes, improved conditionals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  3 12:27:08 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed dhclient-script typo causing ISC DHCPv6 client to execute
  ifup pre-down scripts also while renew, when the ipv6 address
  did not changed (bnc#690859).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 13:31:57 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Implemented optional ldap connect retry loop during the initial
  startup of the dhcp server in cases where the ldap server is not
  yet started. Set the ldap-init-retry <num> option in dhcpd.conf
  to enable it (bnc#627617). Merged in the actual ldap patch.
- Cleaned up init script error reporting, no -TERM for killproc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 27 12:31:25 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC dhcp-4.2.1-P1 release, that provides most of the
  dhclient pretty escape and string option checks. Merged to use
  relaxed domain-name option check causing a regression, when the
  server is misusing it to provide a domain list (compatibility to
  attic clients) and does not provide it via domain-search option;
  pretty escape semicolon as well (bnc#675052, CVE-2011-0997).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 09:56:02 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Discard string options such as host and domain names containing
  disallowed characters or beeing too long. This proctive patch
  limits root-path to a-zA-Z0-9, #%+-_:.,@~/\[]= and a space
  (bnc#675052, CVE-2011-0997).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 09:00:19 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 4.2.1 release (bnc#680298), that provides
  following fixes (digest):
  * Several fixes to OMAPI, cleanup of dereferenced pointers in
    the omapi handle, handling of pipe failures and status code
    in omapi signal handler that may cause connect failure and
    100% CPU use.
  * Handle some DDNS corner cases better
  * Several fixes to lease input and output
  * Corrected side effect of printing all data strings as hex.
  * Host record references leaks causing applying config to all
    innocent clients.
  * Memory leak when parsing a domain name 
  * Fixes to configuration parsing including infinite loop.
  * Fixed for unexpected abort caused by a DHCPv6 decline.
  For the complete list see the RELNOTES file, that is available
  also online at http://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/dhcp-4.2.1-RELNOTES.
- Removed obsolete optional-value-infinite-loop, no-libcrypto
  and CVE-2011-0413.bnc667655 patches.
- Merged the dhclient-send-hostname and ldap patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 14:51:43 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

  to set hostname and default route were applied for primary
  and never per interface settings (bnc#673792).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 10:21:28 UTC 2011 - mt@suse.de

- Added dhcp-4.2.0-xen-checksum.patch by David Cantrell to handle

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 13 08:51:59 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 4.2.0-P2, a security release fixing the
  handling of connection requests on the failover port.
  Previously a connection request from a source that wasn't
  listed as a failover peer would cause the server to become
  non-responsive. ([ISC-Bugs #22679] CERT: VU#159528 CVE:
  CVE-2010-3616, bnc#659059).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 14:50:23 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Enable ldap CASA support on SLE only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 21:56:04 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed to use same/correct dhcrelay6 interface variables in the
  sysconfig file and in the dhcrelay6 init script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 29 15:45:09 CET 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 4.2.0-P1 release, providing a security fix to
  handle a relay forward message with an unspecified address in the
  link address field. Previously such a message would cause the
  server to crash. Thanks to a report from John Gibbons.
  [ISC-Bugs #21992] CERT: VU#102047 CVE: CVE-2010-3611 (bnc#650902)
  The 4.2.0 version is a feature release, implementing asynchronous
  DDNS processing and includes "The LDAP Patch".

  merged our ldap patches from 4.1.x branch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 09:48:56 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed a dhcrelay segfault while receiving packets on interfaces
  without any IPv4 address assigned (bnc#631305, reported upsteam
  as [ISC-Bugs #22409]).
- Fixed a common infinite loop while parsing options with optional
  parts in the value such as in slp-service-scope option (bnc#643845,
  reported upsteam as [ISC-Bugs #22410]).
- Fixed init scripts to report correct LSB codes in status action,
  when the config file or the binary do not exists (bnc#640336).

Wed Sep 29 10:26:37 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed server lease file path in contrib/listlease and leasestate
  changed to extract contrib and examples using setup macro.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  4 12:52:03 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Renamed rfc3442-classless-static-routes_raw in /etc/dhclient.conf
  to rfc3442-classless-static-routes for compatibility with the
  NetworkManager making use of /etc/dhclient.conf now and adopted
  /sbin/dhclient-script (bnc#625770).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  localize problems (bnc#617795)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 14 12:11:57 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 4.1.1-P1 patch release, which contains
  a pair of bug fixes including one for a security related bug
  (bnc#612546, CVE-2010-2156):
  * A bug was fixed that could cause the DHCPv6 server to
    advertise/assign a previously allocated (active) lease to a
    client that has changed subnets, despite being on different
    shared networks. Dynamic prefixes specifically allocated in
    shared networks also now are not offered if the client has
    moved. [ISC-Bugs #21152]
  * Accept a client id of length 0 while hashing. Previously the
    server would exit if it attempted to hash a zero length client
    id, providing attackers with a simple denial of service attack.
    [ISC-Bugs #21253]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 18 08:46:37 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed a dhclient option name and new/old ip address check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 14:10:21 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 4.1.1, the current 4.x series production
  release, providing DHCPv6 client/server/relay implementation.
  The programs act in DHCPv6 mode, when the -6 start option is set.
  We install separate init scripts with a 6 at the end to handle
  them, that is /etc/init.d/dhcpd6 and dhrelay6. Further, there is
  also a link to the binaries with a 6 at the end, e.g. dhclient6,
  making it visible, that the installed version supports DHCPv6.
- Moved additional documentation to a separate dhcp-doc package.
- Changed to provide config files and scripts as source files
  instead of patches to the ISC scripts.
- Adopted spec file and config/scripts, merged in all patches.
- Implemented RFC 3442 classless static routes support in the
  dhclient-script (bnc#555870).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 29 11:18:20 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to ISC DHCP 3.1-ESV, an extended support version release
  which includes a small number of bug fixes (bnc#592178) over the
  3.1.3 version:
  * Modified the handling of a connection to avoid releasing the
    omapi io object for the connection while it is still in use.
    One symptom from this error was a segfault when a failover
    secondary attempted to connect to the failover primary if
    their clocks were not synchronized.
  * Fix test in dhcp_interface_signal_handler to check that the
    inner handler has a signal_handler before calling it.
  * When using 'ignore client-updates;', the FQDN returned to the
    client is no longer truncated to one octet.
  * Clean up some compiler warnings - ticket 19054.
- Fixed vlan interface check in dhcpd-restart-hook if-up.d script
  (bnc#599702)
- Touch dhclient.leases in post-install script instead to provide
  an empty file, versioned provides/obsoletes (rpmlint warnings).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 12 15:53:09 UTC 2010 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed dhclient-script to call ifup -o dhcp and signal "complete"
  to ifup when all configuration is done (bnc#585380,bnc#518219).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  7 20:41:13 CET 2010 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Enable parallel building
- Use large PIE model on all SPARC flavors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 14 22:39:01 CET 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed dhclient-script to use correct sysconfig run dir path
  to not to break the defaultroute/hostname setup (bnc#555095).
- Don't request any specific lease-time by default (bnc#516459).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 10:17:23 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Fixed dhclient-script to forward new_domain_search as DNSSEARCH
  to netconfig.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 13 22:51:49 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to dhcp-3.1.3 maintenance release fixing several issues
  (a digest, see RELNOTES for the complete list):
  * Remove infinite loop in token_print_indent_concat().
  * A parser bug was fixed that segfaulted if site-option-space
    was tried to be used interchangeably with vendor-option-space.
  * Two uninitialized stack structures are now memset to zero,
    thanks to patch from David Cantrell at Red Hat.
  * Memory leak in the load_balance_mine() function is fixed. This
    would leak ~20-30 octets per DHCPDISCOVER packet while failover
    was in use and in normal state.
  * Fixed setting hostname in Linux hosts that require hostname
    argument to be double-quoted.  Also allow server-provided
    hostname to override hostnames 'localhost' and '(none)'.
  * Added client support for setting interface MTU and metric,
    thanks to Roy "UberLord" Marples <roy@marples.name>.
  * Fixed failover reconnection retry code to continue to retry to
    reconnect rather than restarting the listener.
  * Fixed a bug where an OMAPI socket disconnection message would
    not result in scheduling a failover reconnection, if the link
    had not negotiated a failover connect yet (e.g.: connection
    refused, asynch socket connect() timeouts).
  * Versions 3.0.x syntax with multiple name->code option
    definitions is now supported.  Note that, similarly to 3.0.x,
    for by-code lookups only the last option definition is used.
  * Fixed a fenceposting bug when a client had two host records
    configured, one using 'uid' and the other using 'hardware
    ethernet'. CVE-2009-1892
- Updated to dhcp-3.1.3-ldap-patch-mt-01 including previous fixes.
- Merged dhclient script, removed obsolete CVE-2009-1892 fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 11:37:18 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Replaced mt-02 ldap patch from old git repository with equivalent
  one (dhcp-3.1.2p1-ldap-patch-mt-02) from a new repository with
  fixed patch history (http://www.suse.de/~mt/git/dhcp-ldap.git/).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 12 10:38:26 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Added dhcpd-restart-hook if-up.d script that restarts dhcp server
  while network restart when a virtual interfaces as bridge, bond
  or vlan goes up again (bnc#517810).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 14:05:41 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Applied fix for a dhcp client id DoS (CVE-2009-1892, bnc#519413).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 12:47:46 CEST 2009 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to dhcp-3.1.2p1 maintenance release fixing following
  issues:
  * A stack overflow vulnerability was fixed in dhclient that could
    allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root on
    the system, or simply terminate the client, by providing an
    over-long subnet-mask option.
  * A double-dereference in dhclient transmission of DHCPDECLINEs
    was repaired.
  * Fix handling of -A and -a flags in dhcrelay; it was failing
    to expand packet size as needed to add relay agent options.
  * Corrected list of failover state values in dhcpd man page.
  * Fixed a bug that caused some request types to be logged
    incorrectly.
  * Fixed a coredump when adding a class via OMAPI.
  * Clients that sent a parameter request list containing the
    routers option before the subnet mask option were receiving
    only the latter. Fixed.
  * The server wasn't always sending the FQDN option when it should.
  * A partner-down failover server no longer emits 'peer holds all
    free leases' if it is able to newly-allocate one of the peer's
    leases.
  * A cosmetic bug in DHCPDECLINE processing was fixed which caused
    all successful DHCPDECLINEs to be logged as "not found" rather
    than "abandoned".
  * Some failover debugging #defines have been better defined and
    some high frequency messages moved to a deeper debugging symbol.
  * The CLTT parameter in failover is now only updated by client
    activity, and not by failover binding updates.
  * Failover BNDUPD messages are now discarded if they conflict with
    an update that has been trasnmitted, but not acknowledged.
  * A bug cleaning up unknown-xxx temporary option definitions was
    fixed. 
- Removed obsolete dhclient-no-dereference-twice patch
- Improved dhclient-script to apply global dhcp settings, when
  there is no interface config (bnc#480922).

  as short-name even dhcp provides fqdn (bnc#418168)
- Fixed dhclient-script to translate all known dhcp options
  to netconfig variables and unknown with dhclient prefix.
- Fixed dhclient.conf to request all netbios dhcp-options,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 16:58:22 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Removed one of two option_state_dereference calls in dhclient.c
  causing null pointer messages (not critical) in the log.
- Fixed a forgotten fi typo in the dhclient-script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  8 18:29:00 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to dhcp-3.1.1, providing following major new features
  compared to its 3.0.x derivative:
  * A significantly enhanced Failover protocol implementation,
    which:
    + Implements MAC Address Affinity to reduce the frequency
    of clients being assigned new IP addresses; 
    + Supports the assignment of failover-protected addresses
    to legacy BOOTP clients; 
    + Implements a dynamic lease reservation system that provides
    improved accounting of the use of fixed address assignments,
    by allocating fixed addresses out of the pool of dynamic leases
    + Improves tools and reduces operator oversight necessary for
    maintaining a functioning system. 
  * Support for DHCP leasequery, and the VIVCO/VIVSO options, which
    makes easy and comfortable integration with DOCSIS devices and
    the environment in which they are used. 
  * Management of class and subclass statements via OMAPI
  * Several server configuration options related to dynamic DNS
    behavior
  * Other new configuration functions, including "execute()",
    which runs a shell command from within a dhcpd or dhclient
    configuration file 
  For a full list of new features added in this release, please
  observe the changes list.
- Adopted/merged patches, dropped obsolete dhcdbd (NM) patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 22 13:34:07 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Adopted dhclient-script and manual page to use /sbin/netconfig
  that is replacing the modify_resolvconf mechanizm by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 20 15:11:14 CEST 2008 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to dhcp-3.0.7, a maintenance release containing several
  bug fixes; since the 3.0.6 release this are:
  * Fixed "--version" flag in dhcrelay.
  * Clarified error message when lease limit exceeded
  * Fixed a buffer overflow error which could have allowed a denial
    of service under unusual server configurations
  * Bug in octal parsing fixed. Thanks to Bernd Fuhrmann for the
    report and fix.
  * The warning logged when an address range doesn't fit in the
    subnets they were declared has been updated to be more helpful
    and identify the typo in configuration that created the
    spanning addresses.
  * The 'min-secs' configuration parameter's log message has been
    updated to be more helpful.
  * Fixed a bug in which write_lease() might report a failure
    incorrectly.
  * Bug in server configuration parser caused server to get stuck
    on startup for certain bad pool declarations. Thanks to
    Guillaume Knispel for the bug report and fix.
  * Fixed file descriptor leak on listen failure. Thanks to Tom
    Clark.
  * Failover binding acks are now transmitted before new binding
    updates (which may, very rarely, be related to a lease on the
    ack queue).  This eliminates a lease database inconsistency
    bug, as the remote system relies upon the most recent message
    it received from its peer.
  * POOLREQ messages received within 30 seconds of one another are
    ignored.
  * 'lease imbalance' messages are not logged unless rebalance was
    actually attempted ("ten percent" rule).
  * A bug was fixed where the 'giaddr' may be used to find the
    client's subnet rather than its own 'ciaddr'.
  * A log message was introduced to clarify the situation where a
    failover 'address' parameter (the server's local address) did
    not resolve to an IPv4 address.
  * When server is configured with options that it overrides, a
    warning is issued when the configuration file is read, rather
    than at the time the option is overridden. This was important,
    because the warning was given every time the option was
    overridden, which could create a lot of unnecessary logging.
  * When a failover server suspects it has encountered a peer
    running a version 3.1.x failover server, a warning that the
    failover wire protocol is incompatible is printed.
  * The failover server no longer issues a floating point error
    if it encounters a previously undefined option code.
  * A memory leak when using omapi has been fixed.
- Adopted dhcp-send-hostname-rml patch
- Removed obsolete dhcp-3.0.5-pool_eof patch
- Merged changes between server:isc-dhcp and openSUSE:Factory
- Removed down parameter from ifconfig calls in dhclient-script
  because it destroys bonding interfaces and also conflicts with
  an dhcpv6 client running on same interface (bnc#410905).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  by dhcp server (bnc#266215).
- Fixed ntp configuration feature in dhclient-script to try-restart
  the ntp service to apply the server changes. Changed to use new
  per interface server list to avoid merge problems (bnc#375746).

  New patch file: dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-ldap_read.dif

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 25 11:15:57 CET 2007 - mt@suse.de

- Updated to dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch.gz, providing several fixes:
  * unbind from the LDAP server after the config file has been ran
    if the server is being ran in static mode
  * fixed ldap_read_function bug where the entire configuration
    was not being processed
  and extensions / enhancements:
  * added functions for reading config values from the config
    file to clean up the ldap_start() function.
  * new ldap-server-cn option that will be used to locate the
    data in ldap; defaults to the hostname as before (FATE #227).
  * while host is added in the ldap-method dynamic mode, try to
    find if it belongs to a group and apply the group options too.
  * modifies the dhcpHWAddress attribute to case-insensitive, adds
    several new objectclasses, e.g. dhcpLocator, dhcpTsigKey,
    dhcpDnsZone,dhcpFailOver to the dhcp.schema.
  * implements support for dhcpTsigKey, dhcpDnsZone and related.
  * implements auth password query via casa.
- Adopted ldap-patch-strncat, removed ldap-patch-nossl obsoleted by
  ldap-patch-nomd5. New patch: dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-strncat.dif

  with md5 functions from openssl library instead of own copy.
- Added dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-casa-fix.dif, fixing casa support
- Added dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-dhcp-cn.dif, renaming the dhcpd.conf
  ldap-server-cn option to more clear ldap-dhcp-server-cn.
- dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-schema.dif
- Added dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-referrals.dif, implementing support
  for LDAP referrals, introducing new "ldap-referrals <on|off>"
  option in dhcpd.conf.
- Added dhcp-3.0.5-ldap-patch-ssl-opts.dif enabling/implementing
  TLS/LDAPS support. Adds new "ldap-ssl <on|off|ldaps|start_tls>"
  and several "ldap-tls-*" options for dhcpd.conf. By default, the
  server trys to use TLS if possible, but continues without if not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  9 13:48:07 CET 2007 - mt@suse.de

- Added installation of dhcpd.xml, dhcpd service description
  for omc xml-service-provider, fate #301710.
- fix of the ldap-patch strncat fix, bug #202648

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  8 11:33:50 CET 2006 - mt@suse.de

- fix for strncat usage in ldap-patch, bug #202648

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  7 11:28:23 CET 2006 - mt@suse.de

- updated to 3.0.5, bug #212310:
  * This release is a maintenance release that seeks to correct bugs
    introduced in 3.0.4 or prior. The most important of these bugs
    is for 64-bit time_t systems that was introduced in 3.0.4.
  * If you are upgrading from ISC DHCP 3.0.3 or prior and are using
    failover, please take special care of the 'atsfp' values now
    included on failover-controlled leases. See the RELNOTES file.
- adopted dhcp-3.0.4-tmpfile.dif (now dhcp-3.0.5-tmpfile.dif)
- added to provide gpg signature of the tar archive as rpm-source

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 17 20:26:30 CEST 2006 - poeml@suse.de

- there is no SuSEconfig.syslog script anymore, thus remove the
  YaST hint from the sysconfig template

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  9 14:49:58 CEST 2006 - poeml@suse.de

- upstream 3.0.4:
  * fix an insidious bug in the failover implementation which, if
    left unchecked, could result in tying up all leases in
    transitional states (such as released, reset, or expired)
  * fix a confusing (wrong) syslog line, logged by during DDNS update
  * The server now tries harder to survive the condition where it is
    unable to open a new lease file to rewrite the lease state
    database.
  * several other small bug fixes
- update ldap patch. It now supports ldap over ssl, but we don't
  enable it and add dhcp-3.0.4-ldap-patch-nossl.dif, because at the
  moment there seems to be a choice between linking dhclient
  against ldap+ssl libs (not in /lib) or risking clash between
  openssl and isc's md5 symbols. (At least, I assume that this is
  the reason why the ldap patch now removes the isc implementation
  from the build.) Thus, I readd the patch which added ldap libs to
  LIBS in the server subdir only, via ./configure
- if /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd:DHCPD_INTERFACE is set to "ANY", dhcpd
  will now autodetect available network interfaces

  * The dhcpd.conf.5 manpage was updated to be more clear in
    regards to multiple host declarations (thanks to Vincent
    McIntyre).  'Interim' style dynamic updates were also

Fri Apr  8 16:25:06 CEST 2005 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 3.0.3b1 release. Changes since 3.0.2:
  * A bug was fixed where a server might load balance a DHCP REQUEST to its
    peer after already choosing not to load balance the preceeding DISCOVER.
    The peer cannot allocate the originating server's lease.
  * In the case where a secondary server lost its stable storage while the
    primary was still in communications-interrupted, and came back online,
    the lease databases would not be fully transferred to the secondary.
    This was due to the secondary errantly sending an extra UPDREQ message
    when the primary made its state transition to PARTNER-DOWN known.
  * The package will now compile cleanly in gcc 3.3 and 3.4.  As a side effect,
    lease structures will be 9 bytes smaller on all platforms.  Thanks to
    Jason Vas Dias at Redhat.
  * Interface discovery code in DISCOVER_UNCONFIGURED mode is now
    properly restricted to only detecting broadcast interfaces.  Thanks
    to a patch from Jason Vas Dias at RedHat.
  * decode_udp_ip_header was changed so that the IP address was copied out
    to a variable, rather than referenced by a pointer.  This enforces 4-byte
    alignment of the 32-bit IP address value.  Thanks to a patch from Dr.
    Peter Poeml.
  * An incorrect log message was corrected thanks to a patch from
    Dr. Peter Poeml.
  * A bug in DDNS was repaired, where if the server's first DDNS action was
    a DDNS removal rather than a DDNS update, the resolver library's
    retransmit timer and retry timer was set to the default, implying a
    15 second timeout interval.  Which is a little excessive in a synchronous,
    single-threaded system.  In all cases, ISC DHCP should now hold fast to
    a 1-second timeout, trying only once.
  * The siaddr field was being improperly set to the server-identifier when
    responding to DHCP messages.  RFC2131 clarified the siaddr field as
    meaning the 'next server in the bootstrap process', eg a tftp server.
    The siaddr field is now left zeroed unless next-server is configured.
  * mockup_lease() could have returned in an error condition (or in the
    condition where no fixed-address was found matching the shared
    network) with stale references to a host record.  This is probably not
    a memory leak since host records generally never die anyway.
  * A bug was repaired where failover servers would let stale client identifiers
    persist on leases that were reallocated to new clients not sending an id.
  * Binding scopes ("set var = value;") are now removed from leases allocated
    by failover peers if the lease had expired.  This should help reduce the
    number of stale binding scopes on leases.
  * A small memory leak was closed involving client identifiers larger than
    7 bytes, and failover.
  * Configuring a subnet in dhcpd.conf with a subnet mask of 32 bits might
    cause an internal function to overflow heap.  Thanks to Jason Vas Dias
    at Redhat.
  * Some inconsistencies in treating numbers that the lexer parsed as 'NUMBER'
    or 'NUMBER_OR_NAME' was repaired.  Hexadecimal parsing is affected, and
    should work better.
  * In several cases, parse warnings were being issued before the lexical
    token had been advanced to the token whose value was causing an error...
    causing parse warnings to claim the problem is on the wrong token.
  * Host declarations matching on client identifier for dynamic leases will
    no longer match fixed-address host declarations (this is now identical
    to behaviour for host records matching on hardware address).
- print error if binary DHCPD_BINARY is not found [#76392]
- remove patches incorporated upstreams
- update ssh forced command example in dhcpsync man page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 17:53:08 CET 2005 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 3.0.2 release. Changes since 3.0.2rc3:
  * A previously undocumented configuration directive,
    'local-address', was documented in the dhcpd.conf manpage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  8 17:40:05 CET 2005 - mt@suse.de

- Bug #49433: try to reconnect to ldap server if it was down;
  ignore SIGPIPE while ldap_unbind called on closed handle.
  = new patch file: dhcp-3.0.2-ldap-reconnect.mt.dif.gz

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  7 15:29:15 CET 2004 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 3.0.2rc3. Changes since rc2:
  * Two variables introduced in 3.0.2b1 were used without being
    initialized in the case where neither the FILE nor SNAME fields
    were available for overloading.  This was repaired.
  * A heretofore believed to be impossible corner case of the
    option overloading implementation turned out to be possible
    ("Unable to sort overloaded options after 10 tries.").  The
    implementation was reworked to consider the case of an option
    so large it would require more than three chunks to fit.
  * Many other instances of variables being used without being
    initialized were repaired.
  * An uninitialized variable in omapi_io_destroy() led to the
    discovery that this function may result in orphaned pointers
    (and hence, a memory leak).
- refresh the unaligned.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 14:10:15 CET 2004 - poeml@suse.de

- update to 3.0.2rc2. Changes since 3.0.1:
  * allocate_lease() was rewritten to repair a bug in which the server would
    try to allocate an ABANDONED lease when FREE leases were available.
  * Some dhcp-eval.5 manpage formatting was repaired.
  * A bug was fixed in the server's 'option overloading' implementation,
    where options loaded into the 'file' and 'sname' packet fields were
    not aligned precisely as rfc2131 dictates.
  * The FreeBSD client script was changed to support the case where a domain
    name was not provided by the server.
  * A memory leak in 'omshell' per each command line parsed was
    repaired, thanks to a patch from Jarkko Torppa.
  * Log functions writing to stderr were adjusted to use the STDERR_FILENO
    system definition rather than '2'.  This is a no-op for 90% of platforms.
  * One call to trace_write_packet_iov() counted the number of io vectors
    incorrectly, causing inconsistent tracefiles.  This was fixed.
  * Some expression parse failure memory leaks were closed.
  * A host byte order problem in tracefiles was repaired.
  * Pools configured in DHCPD for failover possessing permission lists that
    previously were assumed to not include dyanmic bootp clients are now
    a little more pessimistic.  The result is, dhcpd will nag you about just
    about most pools that possess a 'allow' statement with no 'deny' that
    would definitely match a dynamic bootp client.
  * The 'ddns-update-style' configuration warning bit now insists that
    the configuration be globally scoped.
  * Two memory leaks in dhclient were closed thanks to a patch from Felix
    Farkas.
  * Some minor but excellently pedantic documentation errors were fixed
    thanks to a patch from Thomas Klausner.
  * Bugs in operator precedence in executable statements have been repaired
    once again.  More legal syntaxes should be parsed legally.
  * Failing to initialize a tracefile for any reason if a tracefile was
    specified is now a fatal error.  Thanks to a patch from Albert Herranz.
  * Corrected a bug in which the number of leases transferred as calculated
    by the failover primary and sent to peers in POOLRESP responses may be
    incorrect.  This value is not believed to be used by other failover
    implementations, excepting perhaps as logged information.
  * Corrected a bug in which 'dhcp_failover_send_poolresp()' was in fact
    sending POOLREQ messages instead of POOLRESP mesasges.  This message
    was essentially ignored since failover secondaries effectively do not
    respond to POOLREQ messages.
  * Type definitions for various bitwidths of integers in the sunos5-5
    build of ISC DHCP have been fixed.  It should compile and run more
    easily when built in 64-bit for this platform.
  * "allow known-clients;" is now a legal syntax, to avoid confusion.
  * If one dhcp server chooses to 'load balance' a request to its failover
    peer, it first checks to see if it believes said peer has a free
    lease to allocate before ignoring the DISCOVER.
  * log() was logging a work buffer, rather than the value returned by
    executing the statements configured by the user.  In some cases,
    the work buffer and the intended results were the same.  In some other
    cases, they were not.  This was fixed thanks to a patch from Gunnar
    Fjone and directconnect.no.
  * Compiler warnings for some string type conversions was fixed, thanks
    to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * The netbsd build environments were simplified to one, in which
    -Wconversion is not used, thanks to Andreas Gustafsson.
  * How randomness in the backoff-cutoff dhclient configuration variable
    is implemented was better documented in the manpage, and the behaviour
    of dhclient in REQUEST timeout handling was changed to match that of
    DISCOVER timeout handling.
  * Omapi was hardened against clients that pass in null values, thanks
    to a patch from Mark Jason Dominus.
  * A bug was fixed in dhclient that kept it from doing client-side
    ddns updates.  Thanks to a patch from Andreas Gustafsson, which
    underwent some modification after review by Jason Vas Dias.
  * Failover implementations disconnected due to the network between
    them (rather than one of the two shutting down) will now try to
    re-establish the failover connection every 5 seconds, rather than
    to simply try once and give up until one of them is restarted.
    Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from Infoblox, and field testing
    by Greger V. Teigre which led to an enhancement to it.
  * A problem that kept DHCP Failover secondaries from tearing down
    ddns records was repaired.  Thanks to a patch from Ulf Ekberg from
    Infoblox.
  * 64bit pointer sizes are detected properly on FreeBSD now.
  * A bug was repaired where the DHCP server would leave stale references
    to host records on leases it once thought about offering to certain
    clients.  The result would be to apply host and 'known' scopes to the
    wrong clients (possibly denying booting).  NOTE:  The 'mis-host' patch
    that was being circulated as a workaround is not the way this bug was
    fixed.  If you were a victim of this bug in 3.0.1, you are cautioned
    to proceed carefully and see if it fixes your problem.
  * A bug was repaired in the server's DHCPINFORM handling, where it
    tried to divine the client's address from the source packet and
    would get it wrong.  Thanks to Anshuman Singh Rawat.
  * A log message was introduced to help illuminate the case where the
    server was unable to find a lease to assign to any BOOTP client.
    Thanks to Daniel Baker.
  * A minor dhcpd.conf.5 manpage error was fixed.

- update to 3.0.1
  * The global variable 'cur_time' was centralized and is now
    uniformly of a type #defined in system-dependent headers. It
    had previously been defined in one of many places as a 32-bit
    value, and this causes mayhem on 64-bit big endian systems. It
    probably wasn't too healthy on little endian systems either.
  * A printf format string error introduced in rc14 was repaired.
  * AIX system-dependent header file was altered to only define
    NO_SNPRINTF if the condition used to #ifdef in vsnprintf in
    AIX' header files is false.
  * The Alpha/OSF system-dependent header file was altered to
    define NO_SNPRINTF on OS revisions older than 4.0G.
  * omapip/test.c had string.h added to its includes.

  subdirectory (/var/lib/dhcp/db). With the exception of that
  subdirectory the chroot jail is now owned by root. [#40174]  Use
  mkstemp to create temporary files. [#40267]
- don't use startproc to start dhcpd, because startproc waits a
  fixed time (100 msec) until it decides whether the service is
  running or not. Now that dhcpd might have to contact an LDAP
  server first to read its configuration, starting up can take
  longer than that, and the init script would falsely report
  "success" even when the server cannot start up due to broken
  configuration or non-existant interfaces. Increasing the
  startproc timeout (-t) is not a real alternative because, because
  it would imply a fixed dely to the init script, and it might
  still be too short.  [#40350]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  4 18:24:14 CEST 2004 - poeml@suse.de

- convert configuration names in DHCPD_INTERFACE /
  DHCRELAY_INTERFACES into interface names [#39718]
- fix service restart for the case where the binary has been
  switched for backward compatibility during updating. 
- do not change DHCPD_BINARY for backward compatibility if updating
  from 9.0. This and the last change complete the fix for [#38422]
  and take care of updates from 8.1-9.1 with and without YOU
  updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 30 15:09:44 CEST 2004 - poeml@suse.de

- additionally package the dhcpd binary that uses the Linux packet
  filter API. New option DHCPD_BINARY in sysconfig.dhcpd. [#38422]
- when updating from a previous package using LPF API, retain the
  old behaviour. Fix init script so that 'stop' works also after a
  switch of DHCPD_BINARY.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 22 11:53:00 CEST 2004 - mt@suse.de

- updated to dhcp-3.0.1rc13-ldap-patch also obsolating the
  patches: dhcp-ldap-fix01.dif, dhcpd-conf-to-ldap.pl.dif

    to the broadcast address, but with the source's unicast mac
    address.  Should now conform to rfc2131 section 4.1.
  - Fixed a crash bug in dhclient where dhcpd servers that do not
    provide renewal times results in an FPE.  As a side effect,
    dhclient can now properly handle 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) expiry times
    supplied by servers.  
  - dhcpctl.3 manpage was tweaked.

- update to 3.0.1rc11, relevant fixes are
 - Potential buffer overflows in minires repaired.
 - A correction of boolean parsing syntax validation - some illegal syntaxes
   that worked before are now detected and produce errs, some legal syntaxes
   that errored before will now work properly.
 - Some search-and-replace errors that caused some options to change their
   names was repaired.
 - Shu-min Chang of the Intel corporation has contributed a perl script and
   module that converts the MS NT4 DHCP configuration to a ISC DHCP3
   configuration file.
 - Applied the remainder of the dhcpctl memory leak patch provided by Bill
   Squier at ReefEdge, Inc.  (groo@reefedge.com).
 - Missing non-optional failover peer configurations will now result in a soft
   error rather than a null dereference.
- use BSD sockets instead of LPF (makes iptables filtering of
  packages possible for server and relay. It doesn't work on the
  client, though, so that one requires seperate compilation.) See
  Message-Id: <5.1.0.14.0.20030408175011.00b9c7c0@pop.itd.nrl.navy.mil>

  server is stopped. 
- dhcrelay: add patch from Florian Lohoff (slightly modified),
  that makes the maximal hop count of forwarded packages
  configurable (-c maxcount), sets the default to 4, and rejects
  packages with a hop count higher than maxcount (CAN-2003-0039,
  http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/149953). Add a variable to
  /etc/sysconfig/dhcrelay to pass such additional options.

    option.
  - A order-of-operations bug with 2 match clauses in 1 class

    for the wrong subnets (in particular, 'option routers') was
    applied, thanks to Ted Lemon for the patch.
  - Omshell's handling of dotted octets as values was changed such
    that dots one after the other produce zero values in the
    integer string.
- due to the upstream fixes: drop the reactivate-tr-support.dif and
  format.dif
- retrofitted the (server) package to work for old distributions
  down to 7.2
