- Update to version 4.000
  - The previous weights in two families (Dai Banna SIL Light and
    Dai Banna SIL Book) are now included in one family (Dai Banna
    SIL) with an additional weight (Medium).
  - For the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters the weights
    should be the same as before, just with different font names.
    For example, Dai Banna SIL Light (Bold) is now Dai Banna SIL
    (SemiBold). Note the change in the font name and the (weight).
  - If there are any differences, the change in build tools (and
    sources) would probably be the reason. The build process for
    the fonts completely changed to using open sources built using
    open source tools.
  - Most of the Latin characters have been replaced. In the
    previous release the Latin characters were the same weight even
    if the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters were a
    different weight. Now a different Latin font was imported
    (Gentium Plus) at the correct weight (such as Bold) and style
    (such as Italic).
