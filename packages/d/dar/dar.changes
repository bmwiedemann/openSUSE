Wed Dec  7 22:27:12 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.7.8:
  * updating code and man page about the way to solve the conflict of
  sequentially reading the archive of reference when binary delta is
  implicitly present for differential/incremental backups
  * added -avc option to surface libcurl verbose messages
  * fixed bug in dar where a sanity check about slice min digit detection
  was applied to the local filesystem when the backup was stored
  remotely, this prevented the reading or remote backups
  * exposing libcurl version to the version output (new API call added
  * remove extra slash (/) found after hostname in URL passed to libcurl
  * fixed self test reported error about mycurl_easyhandle_node.cpp
  * improved error message when libcurl fails to connect to an sftp server
  * fixed bug in libdar in the way libcurl is called for reading a file
  using ftp protocol
  * fixed bug in libdar when asking libcurl the size of the file we are
  writing (libcurl segfaults with ftp protocol). In addition, we now
  record this info during the write process (faster and more efficient).
  * fixed bug met when creating a backup on very close and/or high
  bandwidth ftp and sftp repos with the --hash option set, triggering a
  race condition that led dar to sometime hang unexpectedly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  8 21:01:26 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.7.7:
  * added support for sequential reading more of sliced backup, to
  accommodate tape support used with slices (at the opposite of dar_split)
  * fixing few typos in doc
  * making libdar more tolerant when calls to fadvise fail
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  5 20:41:57 UTC 2022 - Matthias Eliasson <elimat@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.7.6
  * adding -f option to dar_cp
  * adding static version of dar_cp (dar_cp_static) as compilation outcome
  * added FAQ for tape usage with dar
  * fixing error in libdar header file installation
  * fixed bug met when interrupting the creation of a block compressed
    backup (always used by lzo compression and by other algorithm only
    when performing multi-threaded compression)
  * typo fixes in documentation
  * fixed message in lax mode used to obtain from the user the archive format
    when this information is corrupted in the archive.
  * fixing lax mode condition that popped up without being requested
  * fixing bug met when reading slice an special block device by mean of
    a symlink
  * adapting sanity checks to the case of a backup read from a special
    device in sequential-read mode.
  * fixed bug that lead dar to report CRC error while reading a backup
    from a pipe with the help of an isolated catalogue
  * adding -V option to dar_split (was using -v) for homogeneity with
    other commands

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  7 14:14:09 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 2.6.15
  * fixed error message formatting error leading message to contain
    garbage in place of system error information.
  * fixing bug (internal error) met while trying restoring files and
    dirs without sufficient write permission on the destination
    directory tree to perform the operation.
  * adding minor feature to avoid restoring Unix sockets (-au)
  * fixing dar-catalogue.dtd
- Update to version 2.6.14
  * fixed bug met when removing slices of an old backup located on
    a remote sftp server
  * fixed bug in cache layer met when writing sliced backup to a
    remote ftp or sftp repository
  * enhancement to the -[ and -] options to work as expected when
    "DOS" formatted text file is provided as a file listing.
- Drop outdated Provides / Obsoletes, RPM will automatically detect
  new dependency of linking packages, as long as -devel package
  does not get renamed or packages use dlopen and manually require it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 18 07:45:45 UTC 2020 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Enable curl and rsync support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 16 15:36:49 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 2.6.13: 
  - fixed compilation warning in testing routine (outside libdar and dar)
  - due to change in autoconf, the --sysconfdir path (which defaults to
    ${prefix}/etc) was read as an empty string, leading dar to look for
    darrc system file at the root of the filesystem (/darrc)
  - fixed bug that should occur in extremely rare conditions (it has been
    discover during 2.7.0 validation process): compression must be used,
    no ciphering, no hashing, file changed at backup time or had a poor
    compression ratio, was not saved at slice boundary, the previous
    entry had an EA saved but no FSA or an unchanged FSA. In such
    conditions are all met, dar tries to resave the file in place, but
    partially or totally overwites the EAs of the previous entry leading
    to archive testing to fail for these EA (though the archive could be
    finished without error).
  - fixed bug met when case insensitive mask is requested (-an option)
    and locale of file to restore or backup is not the one the dar binary
    is run with.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 16 12:16:07 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- update to 2.6.12:
  - fixed regression met in 2.6.11 when generating encrypted
    archives
  - fixing bug in dar_manager libdar part, met when the two oldest
    entries for a file are recorded as unchanged (differential
    backup)
  - fixed typo in dar_manager man page
  - updated lax mode to ignore encryption flag found in header
    and trailer
  - fixed two opposite bugs in strong encryption code that
    annihilated each other, by chance
  - fixing bug met when merging an archive an re-compressing
    the data with another algorithm that gives a less good result,
    this condition lead the merging operation to fail
    reporting a CRC mismatch
  - improving archive header code to cope with unknown flags

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 17 12:33:57 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.6.10:
  - update the configure script to handle some undocumented --enable-*
    options that existed but were not expected to be used.
  - fixed spelling in darrc comments
  - fixed bug in dar_split that could occur in very rare conditions
  - fixed EA support build failure due to what seems to be a change
    in Linux kernel header
  - fixed symbol conflict with s_host of in.h on omniOS platform

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 15 13:45:47 UTC 2020 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 2.6.9
  * too many changes to list, see ChangeLog file 
- Drop dar-use-libc-xattr.patch (fixed upstream)
- Drop Group tag
- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 24 07:12:50 UTC 2018 - adrian@suse.de

- fix build for Factory
- update to version 2.5.14
  (relevant parts from upstream)
  - made libgcrypt built-in memory guard be initialized before obtaining
    ligcrypt version, to respect libgcrypt usage (but no problem was seen
    nor reported about this inconsistency)
  - fixed syntax error in XML listing output (EA_entry and Attributes
    tags)
  - fixed bugs in dar_split: cygwin support, filedescriptors were not
    explicitly closed at end of execution, allocating buffer on heap
    rather than in the stack for better size flexibility, avoiding buffer
    size to be greater than SSIZE_MAX.
  - added -s option to dar_split in order to disable the by default SYNC
    write that was used and which caused poor performance. To keep the
    same behavior as the older dar_split (and its poor performances) you
    need now using -s option.
  - dar_split enhancement: added call to syncfs before closing the file
    descriptor in split_output mode
  - fixed bug in dar_split that was did not lead dar_split to completely
    fulfill an device before asking for user to change the media when
    used in split_output mode, this was sometimes leading dar reporting
    file as corrupted at dar_split at media boundary.
  - added feature in dar_split to show the amount of data written since
    the last media change
  - added -az option to automatically nullify negative dates returned from
    the system in the archive under creation (filesystem is not modified)
  - included the birthtime (HFS FSA) into the negative dates handling
  - modified behavior: dar now fails upon unknown option instead of warning
    the option is unknown and thus ignored
  - fixed missing throw in tools.cpp (exception condition was not reported)
  - dar now aborts if a line exceeding 20479 bytes is met in a listing file
  - fixed bug in file listing (-[ option) leading some directories and their
    content to be excluded in a somehow rare condition
  - improved behavior when dar reads a negative date. Instead of aborting
    it now asks the user if it can substitute such value by zero
  - improved behavior when dar is asked to read an archive located in a
    directory that does not exist. DUC file passed to -E option is now
    properly run in that case too and has the possibility for example to
    create that directory and download requested file
  - minor feature: displays the archive header which is never ciphered and
    aborts. This feature is activated while listing archive content and
    adding the -aheader option. This brings the side effect to invert two
    lines in the archive summary (dar -l archive -q) "catalogue size" and
    "user comment".
  - adding date format info for -w option in "dar_manager -h" usage help
  - fixed several mistakes in tools.cpp leading compilation to fail under
    certain environments
  - fixed bug in the filtering mechanism relying on file listing (-[ and
    -] options) that could not find an entry in the listing upon certain
    condition leading a file not being excluded as requested or not
    included as requested
  - fixed bug: -r option (only more recent overwriting policy) was
    considering a file to be more recent when it had the exact same date as
    the file in place.
  - updating documentation about requirements for compiling dar from sources
  - fixed bug: bug met when restoring of a file that has the immutable
    flag set. Dar/libdar failed restoring such file in the context of
    differential/incremental backup. The fix consists of the removal of the
    immutable flag from filesystem before restoring the new version of the
    file's data, then setting back the immutable flag afterward.
  - updating FAQ with description of the way dar uses lzo compression
    compared to the lzop program
  - fixed bug: aborting an archive was leading to an unreadable archive in
    direct mode, most of the time when strong encryption was used
  - minor new feature: added two flavors of lzo algorithm: lzop-1 and lzop-3
    in order to match compression levels 1 and 3 of the lzop command
  - fixed bug: merging operation could wrongly melt different unrelated hard
    linked inodes when merging using an archive which results from a previous
    merging operation.
  - fixed bug: aborting an archive was sometimes leading to an unreadable
    archive in direct mode (was readable only in --sequential-read mode)
  - fixed bug: libgpgme was only present at linking time of final binaries
    (dar, dar_slave, dar_xform, dar_manager, dar_cp, dar_split), not at
    linking time of libdar, which caused problem under Linux Rosa distro
    where the "no-undefined" flag is passed to the linker.
  - minor new feature: -ay option has been added to display sizes in bytes
    instead of the default which uses the largest possible unit (Kio, Mio,
    and so on.)

Mon Dec 21 12:10:09 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.4.20
	* fixed display bug in dar_manager met when using -o option and 
		adding options for dar that does not exist for dar_manager 
		(like -R option)
	* reactivating disabled (by mistake) optimization for some 
		read-only dar manager database operations

		recent files of an archive when they have been marked as 
		removed in a more recent archive of the same dar_manager 
		database.
	* fixed bug met while restoring in sequential read mode a file 
		having several copies (was modified at the time it was saved 
		and retry-on-change was set).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 19 10:39:48 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 2.4.18
  * Initial Vector used for strong encryption was set with 
    pseudo-random data generated using SHA1 message digest and 
    blowfish cipher, which are not available when ligcrypt is 
    running in FIPS mode. Since 2.4.18 we now use SHA256 and AES256 
    for IV assignment in order to have libdar compatible with FIPS 
    mode. For data encryption nothing changes: the cipher specified 
    (-K, -J, -$ options on CLI) are used as before.
  * fixing bug met when performing archive isolation in 
    sequential-read mode, If an archive corruption or truncated 
    archive leads an inode to not have its CRC readable, dar aborts 
    and issues a BUG report.

Fri Jul  6 19:43:02 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Remove libdar Requires from the devel package: it's not needed.
  Note: this did not cause any issue, as libdar4 provide libdar as
  a symbol.
- Package AUTHORS COPYING NEWS TODO ChangeLog as normal %doc files,
  without copying them around first.
- Rename libdar-4 subpackage to libdar4, following the SLPP. Change
  the rpm group of libdar to System/Libraries.
- Create a -lang package, which is Recommended by libdar. This
  actually helps in the future when libdar5 would ever come out.
  Currently, due to the language files being part of the library
  package, it would be impossible to install multiple versions.
- Pass --disable-static to configure: no need to build it. And as
  a result, we also do not have to delete it in install again.
- Add fdupes BuildRequires and use it in %install to link the same
  files together.
- Run spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  6 12:42:13 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Add dar-DARWIN.patch: Fix the generation of the installed
  config.h header. Our autotools create a config.h.in which also
  contains #ifned _DARWIN_*, which is matched by the upstream grep
  command, but the matching #endif is not matched... See discussion
  and debug on http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2012-07/msg00042.html.

  with the new dar package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 18 07:18:26 CEST 2006 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 2.3.0 with lots of new features.
- added user_interaction::pause2() method
- added the snapshot feature
- added the Cache Directory Tagging detection feature
- adapted Wesley's patch for a pkgconfig for libdar
- added -[ and -] options (file selection from file listing)
  Important consequence for libdar user programs:
  the fs_root argument is now expanded to full absolute path inside libdar,
  thus the mask you will give for path inclusion/exclusion (the "subtree" argument)
  will be used against full absolute path of files under consideration
  for the operation. Assuming you have fs_root=tmp/A and the current
  directory is /tmp, your mask will be used against strings like
  /var/tmp/A/some/file. (instead of tmp/A/some/file as in the previous API
  version). Things are equal if the fs_root is given an absolute path.
- changed archive format to "05". Due to complete review of EA management.
- upon some signal reception, dar aborts the backup nicely, producing a
  completely formatted archive will all the file saved so far. This archive can
  be take as reference for a further backup to continue the operation at a later
  time.
- dar_manager aborts properly upon certain signal reception (do not let the database
  partially updated).
- dar_slave and dar_xform now recognize when a slicename is given in place of a basename
- reviewed thread_cancellation (API change) for it be possible to cancel several thread at the same time
- prevent some dead-lock situation that can occur when a signal is received inside a critical section
- dar_cp, dar_xform and dar_slave also abort nicely upon signal reception
- dar_manager can now restore files based on a given date (not always the most recent version)
- dar_manager now has an interactive mode (-i option)
- change in API, the warning() method need not be overwritten, but the new protected method
  inherited_warning() must be inherited in its place (same function, same prototype
  as the original warning() method).
- dar_manager features are now part of libdar. API has been completed with theses new features
- added the "last_slice" context (%c with -E option) when creating an archive
- dar now check a file has not been modified while it was reading it, if so it reports a warning and returns a specific exit code
- remove included gettext from the package (it is more a source of conflict with external gettext and if somebody needs internationalization better is to install libintl/gettext on its own).
- added George Foot feedback about the good backup practice sort guide.
- added -e option to dar_manager
- added the progressive_report feature in the API
- dar can now pause every N slice where N >= 1
- integrated Dave Vasilevsky's patch to support Extended Attributes and file forks under MacOS X
- added method in API for external program be able to list dar_manager databases, their file contents and the statistics
- added the merge/sub-archive feature
- remove [list of path] from command line (-g option is now mandatory)
- added regex expression in filters (-ar/-ag options)
- added -ak option
- added the --comparison-field option (extension of the --ignore-owner option aka -O option)
- added the -af option (backup files more recent than a given date, others are keept as already saved)
- dar now take care that an escape character can be sent when pressing the arrow keys and avoid considering them in this situation
- dar will no refuse to abort if user presses escape when dar asks the user to be ready to write to a new slice
- adapted Wesley Legette's patch for an xml archive listing
