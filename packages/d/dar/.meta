  <title>Backup and Restore Application</title>
  <description>Dar (Disk Archive) is a hardware-independent backup solution. Dar uses
catalogs (unlike tar),which it makes it possible to extract a single
file without having to read the entire archive. It is also possible to
create incremental backups. Dar archives can also be created or used
with the libdar library (for example, with KDar, a KDE application).
This package contains the command line tools and documentation.</description>
