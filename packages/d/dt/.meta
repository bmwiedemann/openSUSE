  <title>Generic data test program</title>
  <description>dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported
by the operating system.  In its simplest mode of operation, dt writes
and then verifys its default data pattern, then displays performance
statisics and other test parameters before exiting.  Since verification
of data is performed, dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
