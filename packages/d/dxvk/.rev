  ## Performance improvements
  - Reduced unnecessary worker thread synchronization around resource readbacks for both D3D11 and D3D9. This can significantly increase CPU-bound performance in games like **Assassin's Creed: Origins** and other titles built on the same engine, with smaller improvements seen in **Elex II**, **God of War**, **GTA IV** and others.
  - When using [D3D11_MAP_WRITE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_map) on a staging resource that's currently being read by the GPU, DXVK will now attempt to create a copy of that resource in order to avoid GPU synchronization. This improves performance in **Quantum Break** and potentially other games. This behaviour can be tweaked using the `d3d11.maxImplicitDiscardSize` option.
  - Optimized [UpdateSubresource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-updatesubresource) for small constant buffer updates. This further improves performance in **God of War** and potentially other games.
  - Improved the way resource uploads and staging buffers are handled in D3D11. This may reduce memory usage and CPU overhead in some - Added more information to the HUD that can be useful for troubleshooting performance issues: GPU synchronizations per frame, worker thread synchronizations per frame, and pipeline barrier count.
  - GPU synchronization, when necessary, no longer uses busy-waiting, which may reduce power consumption on portable devices in some games.
  ## Bug fixes and Improvements
  - Added a `D3D11On12CreateDevice` stub so applications using this don't immediately crash (PR #2278).
  **Note** that supporting D3D11on12 is currently not viable.
  - Version numbers for Intel's Windows driver should now be reported properly.
  **Note** that using DXVK on this driver is highly discouraged and will likely not work.
  - **ArmA 2**: Fixed texture-related issues (PR #2477).
  - **Black Mesa**: Fixed 
  - **Resident Evil 0**, **5**, **6**, **Resident Evil: Revelations 2**: Improved performance (PR #2466).
  - **Total War: Warhammer III**: Significantly improved GPU-bound performance on setups with a dedicated GPU.
  ## Per-game workarounds
  Replaced the previous `d3d11.apitraceMode` option with  `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources`, which provides a more granular way to specify resource types to allocate in cached system memory. Refer to the example `dxvk.conf` for details. This change was not made for the equivalent D3D9 option yet.
  Normally, [D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_usage) resources are expected to be write-only from the CPU and read-only from the GPU, but despite this, some games perform CPU-side reads on the mapped memory, which can cause severe performance degradation since those reads would have to go over PCI-E, or at least uncached write-combined memory. This is especially problematic on systems with Resizeable BAR and can cause issues even on Windows D3D11 drivers.
  Games that will use this option by default include **Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition** (#2491), **Anno 1800**, **Final Fantasy XIV**, **Nier Replicant**, **The Evil Within** (PR #2522), and all games that previously had `d3d11.apitraceMode` enabled by default.
- updated to 1.9.4
  Bug fixes and Improvements:
  - Fixed an issue that would cause VRAM to not be utilized on RBAR-enabled Nvidia GPUs if the `dxvk.shrinkNvidiaHvvHeap`option is enabled (#2438).
  - Enabled strict D3D9 float emulation by default on future versions of RADV. This may improve both accuracy and GPU-bound performance (PR #2448)..
  - Improved memory allocation behaviour. This may reduce memory usage especially in games that create multiple processes or D3D devices.
  - Removed obsolete options to disable OpenVR support.
  - **God of War**: Enabled performance optimizations and DLSS support. *Note that these changes are already included in Proton Experimental.* (forwarded request 959619 from msmeissn)</comment>

    <user>anag_factory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 2.7.1:
  * Fixed a regression that would cause MSAA resolves to look like
    MSAA was not working in a number of D3D9 games.
  * Improved performance in some D3D9 games by avoiding unnecessary
    render pass barriers, such as Dead Space 2
    (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5112).
  * Fixed the way tessellation factors are interpreted for line tessellation.
    This fixes particle rendering in DCS World and potentially other issues.
    (gh#doitsujin/dxvk#4327)
  * Added the d3d9.modeCountCompatibility configuration option
    to work around buffer overflows in older games that do not expect
    monitors to support more than ~16 different display modes.
    This fixes a crash in AquaNox 2.
  * Alone in the Dark: Worked around a crash on start.
    (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5158)
  * Comanche 4: Worked around an issue where the in-game anti-aliasing
    option would only be exposed on certain GeForce4 Ti GPUs.
  * Crysis 3: Removed GPU vendor override to work around an issue
    where the game wouldn't start after recent EA app updates.
  * Note that this change may cause a noticeable performance regression
    on AMD systems due to less efficient code paths in the game.
  * Dungeon Siege 2: Fixed a regression that would cause character
    models to not show in the menu. (gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5175)
  * Everybody's Gone to the Rapture: Worked around poor CPU-bound
    performance. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5168)
  * Fallout New Vegas: Added vendor override to work around an issue
    with the FNV Reloaded mod using an unimplemented NVAPI function on Nvidia GPUs.
    (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5136)
  * Guilty Gear: Added 60 FPS cap to work around the game speeding up at higher frame rates.
    (gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5142, PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5143)
  * PsiOps: Added 60 FPS cap to work around broken physics at higher
    frame rates. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5145)
  * Scarface: Worked around a rendering issue caused by breaking
    changes in D3D9 API behaviour.
  * Team Fortress 2: Fixed an MSAA-related rendering issue.
    (gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5119, PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5132)
  * The Witcher 1: Added 300 FPS cap to work around a game issue where
    Geralt's hair would not render properly in the inventory menu.
  * Top Spin 2004: Fixed a memory leak as well as rendering issues.
    (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5155)
- Changes from 2.7.0:
  * Driver support
  The Vulkan extension VK_KHR_maintenance5 is now required.
  DXVK has been relying on guarantees made by this extension since version 2.5,
  so in order to remove some maintenance burden,
  fallbacks that would allow older drivers to run were now removed.
  Note: These changes will primarily affect Windows users on AMD Polaris and
  Vega GPUs. On Linux, these older GPUs will keep working on RADV
  when using Mesa 25.0 or newer.
  * Binding model changes
  Descriptor management was largely rewritten and modernized.
  On newer AMD and Nvidia cards, VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer is now used by default,
  which significantly reduces CPU overhead compared to the legacy binding model
  and may thus improve CPU-bound performance in games such as
  Final Fantasy XIV, God of War, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Watch Dogs 2 and others.
  This feature remains disabled on older GPUs due to severe performance
  regressions in some cases,
  specifically on Nvidia Pascal or older, as well as AMD RDNA2 or older
  when using AMDVLK or the AMD Windows driver.
  RADV is unaffected by these issues.
  Note: A small hit to GPU-bound performance is expected in some cases,
  in exchange for more consistent overall performance.
  Users can override the default behaviour with the dxvk.enableDescriptorBuffer option.
  Enabling Resizeable BAR on supported systems is strongly recommended.
  * Memory management
   Memory defragmentation is now enabled by default on Intel Battlemage
   and Lunar Lake GPUs. On older Intel GPUs, this feature remains
   disabled as it may cause rendering issues for unknown reasons,
   see gh#doitsujin/dxvk#4395.
   On discrete GPUs, DXVK will now enforce the driver-reported VRAM
   budget as much as possible, and dynamically evict unused resources
   to system memory when under memory pressure.
   This should improve performance in many Unity Engine titles on
   VRAM-constrained systems, and may allow for higher texture quality
   settings to be used in some games.
   Temporary slowdowns and stutters are still expected when exceeding
   VRAM capacity.
   Note: This feature currently does not work as intended on AMD GPUs
   due to kernel driver issues.
   * Legacy feature removal
   The state cache was introduced in Version 0.80 to reduce shader
   compilation stutter, and has been largely unused since
   the introduction of VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library in DXVK 2.0.
   In order to reduce maintenance burden, particularly with pipeline-related
   changes in this release, this legacy feature was now removed.
   Additionally, the d3d9.forceSwapchainMSAA option was removed.
   This feature was not really useful since most games either use additional
   render targets or provide a built-in MSAA option themselves anyway.
   For games that do not provide built-in MSAA, users are encouraged
   to use Gamescope to run these games with a higher render resolution instead.
   * Added support for planar video output views.
     (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#4872).
   * This is required for video playback in JR EAST Train Simulator.
   * D3D11 shaders will now zero-initialize all variables and groupshared
     memory by default in order to work around game bugs resulting in undefined behaviour.
     The d3d11.zeroWorkgroupMemory option was removed accordingly.
   * Optimized D3D9 StretchRect in certain multisample resolve cases
      encountered in Source Engine. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5023)
   * Fixed an instance of invalid Vulkan usage in Modulus,
     and possibly other Unity Engine games that use the D3D11 video API.
   * Implemented support for the ID3DDestructionNotifier interface.
   * Vulkan devices that lack the required feature support to run
     DXVK will no longer be listed as DXGI / D3D9 adapters.
     This may fix crashes in case an outdated graphics driver or an
     unsupported integrated GPU are present on the system.
   * Trying to build DXVK in a MinGW environment with AVX enabled
     will now result in a compile-time error.
   * We cannot support AVX builds due to toolchain issues, nor is
     it expected to be beneficial.
   * Astebreed: Fixed crash when changing graphics options.
     (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5034)
   * GTR - FIA GT Racing Game: Worked around a game issue that would
     cause it to not start. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5072)
   * LEGO City Undercover: Worked around a game issue that would
     cause the intro video to be broken.
     (gh#doitsujin/dxvk#4997, PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5000)
   * Star Trek: Starfleet Command III: Worked around resource leak
     in GOG build. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5056)
   * Test Drive Unlimited 2: Worked around alt-tab issue causing
     input loss. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5057)
   * Wargame: European Escalation: Worked around gamma issue when
     the game detects an Nvidia GPU. (PR gh#doitsujin/dxvk#5055) (forwarded request 1324727 from Thaodan)</comment>
