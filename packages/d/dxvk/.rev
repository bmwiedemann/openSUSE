    <comment>- updated to 1.9.2
  - Reduced overall CPU overhead in D3D9.
  - Fixed various failures in wine's D3D9 tests.
  - Fixed various issues when the `d3d9.evictManagedTexturesOnUnlock` option is enabled.
  - Fixed various issues when the `d3d11.relaxedBarriers` option is enabled.
  - **Call of Cthulhu**: Fixed reflection rendering (#2248)
  - **Crysis 3**, **Homefront The Revolution**: Worked around poor performance (#2256) (#2241)
  - **GODS**: Fixed gamma curve (#2250)
  - **Total War Medieval 2**: Fixed black lines on the world map (#2258) and settings text (#2247)
    The game still crashes when loading battles due to running out of address space.
  - **Fantasy Grounds**: Fix incorrect rendering (#2251)
  - **Need For Speed Heat**: Fixed ground textures rendering incorrectly (#1764).
  - **Paranormal Files**: Fix black screen (#2192)
  - **Pathfinder: Wrath of the Rightous**: Fixed GPU hang in loading screen.
     Note that the game itself has further issues loading certain parts
     of the game, which do not appear to be related to wine or DXVK in
     any way.
  - **Payday**: Fix flickering reflections (#2259)
  - **Shin Megami Tensei 3**: Fixed hang when entering save room (#2161)
  - **Sine Mora EX**: Added 60 FPS lock (#2261)
- updated to 1.9.1
  - Fixed a number of performance and stability issues introduced with the D3D9 locking rewrite in 1.9 (#2142, #2149, #2150, #2164, #2168).
  - Rewrote the way staging textures are handled in D3D11. This can reduce memory usage and the number of image copies necessary to move data between the CPU and GPU, and fixes severe performance issues in Roblox on Nvidia GPUs.
  - Removed some workarounds for very old Mesa versions (19.0 and older).
  - Reimplemented locking primitives based on Windows SRW locks. This may be more efficient compared to the winpthreads implementation in mingw builds.
  - Earth Defense Force 5: Work around performance issues caused by the game frequently turning vertical synchronization on and off between frames (#2127)
  - Far Cry 1: Spoof Nvidia GPU in order to enable higher-quality water rendering.
  - Far Cry 5 and other Dunia Engine games: Fixed various issues due to uninitialized memory (PR #2137).
  - GTA IV: Fixed broken app profile that would break the game on Nvidia GPUs.
  - Risen 3: Fixed crash on Nvidia GPUs (#2154).</comment>

    <comment>- updated to 1.9.3
  - DLSS should now work in supported games in combination with [dxvk-nvapi](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi).
  - Optimized D3D9 shader constants by relying on `VK_EXT_robustness2` and removed the old app options for games using software vertex processing. (#2282)
  - Added an option for more accurate emulation of D3D9 floating point behaviour and enabled that by default for a bunch of games. (#2294, #2359). This fixes issues in **Red Orchestra 2**, **Dark Souls 2** (original version), **Dog Fight 1942**, **Bayonetta**, **Rayman Origins**, **Guilty Gear Xrd** and **Richard Burns Rally**.
  - Fixed a DXGI issue which would sometimes cause games to fail to enter fullscreen mode on some displays that do not support low rates across all resolutions (#2395).
  - **Black Mesa**: Fixed a regression with shadows. (#2317)
  - **Crysis 3 Remastered**: Worked around poor performance. (#2339)
  - **Euro Truck Simulator**: Fixed a shading issue resulting in black geometry (#2312)
  - **Injustice Gods Among Us**: Fixed missing characters on the character selection screen. (#2332)
  - **Rocksmith 2014**: Fixed white screen on startup. (#2383)
  - **Spliter Cell: Chaos Theory**: Fixed brightness with the shader model 3 option. (#2340)
  - **Sim City 2013**: Fixed rendering.
  - **The Guild 3**: Fixed artifacts in overview map.</comment>
