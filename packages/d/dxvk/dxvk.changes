Wed May 24 02:29:22 UTC 2023 - Björn Bidar <bjorn.bidar@thaodan.de>

- Update to 2.2
  * 3D11On12 support
  In order to enable D3D12 support in recent Unity Engine titles such
  as Lego Builder's Journey, this release introduces support for creating D3D11
  devices from a D3D12 device using D3D11On12CreateDevice, as well as
  the basic ID3D11On12Device interface. This is achieved by importing
  the Vulkan device and resource handles from vkd3d-proton into DXVK,
  and otherwise uses DXVK's existing D3D11 implementation.

  A vkd3d-proton build as of HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton@26c4fed
  or later is required for this to work.

  * D3D9 Partial Presentation
  DXVK now supports presenting to parts of a window by copying the contents of the backbuffer
  to system memory and then drawing them into the window on the CPU.
  This improves compatibility with game launchers, particularly those
  based on Microsoft's WPF toolkit, and some visual novels.
  It will however come with a noticable performance hit.

  Additionally, overall behaviour of D3D9 swap chains was improved and
  the d3d9.noExplicitFrontBuffer option was removed.
  * Logging changes
  When running on Proton or plain Wine, DXVK will no longer create
  log files by default and instead only write log messages to the console
  using wine-specific functionality, in order to avoid creating unnecessary extra files.
  This matches vkd3d-proton behaviour. Note that log file creation
  can be re-enabled by setting the environment variable DXVK_LOG_PATH to a valid path.

  When filing bug reports, users are encouraged to upload the full Proton log.

  * Warnings about unknown interfaces being queried via QueryInterface
    will only be logged once   in order to avoid growing log files
    indefinitely in some games. (#3231)
  * Fixed a regression when rendering YUY2 or UYUY texture formats.
    This fixes in-game videos in Jade Empire (#3182) and
    Sid Meier's Pirates (#3189) (PR #3342)
  * Fixed an issue wherein threads were not properly destroyed.
  * Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by incorrect layout tracking
    when enabling feedback loops for a texture.
  * Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by 0x0 sized clears in D3D9.
  * D3D9 StateBlocks now only allocate memory for the parts that are actually used.
    This fixes Total War: Shogun 2 running out of address space when
    using the D3D9 renderer. (#2703, PR #3248)
  * Improved usage of some VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 features to
    avoid hitting slow paths on some drivers.
  * Improved enumeration of DXGI outputs on systems with multiple GPUs.
    This fixes performance issues with recent RE Engine games (D3D12) on such systems.
  * Significantly reduced memory usage in situations where games create unused D3D11 devices.
  * Battle Fantasia Revised Edition: Locked frame rate to 60 FPS
    to work around game bugs at higher frame rates. (PR #3256)
  * Cold Fear: Fixed missing geometry (#3293, PR #3390)
  * Dawn of Magic 2: Fixed a crash upon start (#3271, PR #3272)
  * DC Universe Online: Fixed a hang after alt-tabbing out and back in. (#3314, PR #3316)
  * Far Cry 2: Work around rendering issues on Intel hardware,
    as well as low performance on all GPUs. (PR #3241)
  * Halo: The Master Chief Collection: Fixed memory leak due to invalid
    query usage by the game (PR #3273)
  * Warhammer 40k: Space Marine: Fixed shadow rendering (#3298, PR #3305)

- Keep setup_dxvk.sh script that was deleted by upstream.
  For more context see:
  https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/commit/64cb1ad208f80b11400eef779e99fec223754098
- Update to 2.1
  * HDR support
    On systems supporting HDR10 color spaces, HDR can now be
    enabled by setting the environment variable DXVK_HDR=1,
    or by setting the option dxgi.enableHDR = True in the configuration
    file. When using vkd3d-proton 2.8 or newer, this will allow D3D12
    games to detect and use the HDR10 color space if they support it.

    No major Linux desktop environment currently supports HDR. In order
    to use this on Linux, a Gamescope session with --hdr-enabled is required.
    This is currently only supported under AMDGPU and requires kernel patches
    from the josh-hdr-colorimetry branch.

  * Shader compilation improvements
    Use of pipeline libraries was extended to pipelines with tessellation or
    geometry shaders in order to further reduce stutter. Additionally, more features
    of the VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 extension are leveraged to reduce stutter
    in some situations when MSAA is used, provided that the Vulkan driver supports them.

  * Sample rate shading
    For older games that support MSAA, the d3d9.forceSampleRateShading and
    d3d11.forceSampleRateShading options were added to let users enable
    sample rate shading for all shaders. This will have a very high
    impact on GPU-bound performance, but may increase overall image quality
    in certain games that suffer from specular aliasing or shimmering alpha-tested geometry.
  * Improved D3D11 command submission logic in order to make overall performance more consistent,
    and to bring DXVK's behaviour more in line with native D3D11 drivers.
  * Fixed D3D11 reference counting issues around 2D textures. (#3169)
  * Fixed Vulkan validation errors when creating DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM UAVs.
    Note that UAVs of this format may not work as expected.
  * Fixed Vulkan validation errors that would occur when allocating dedicated image memory
    on Nvidia GPUs in some situations.
  * Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by broken timeline semaphores on 32-bit Proton.
  * Worked around an issue with the Uplay overlay being stuck on screen. (#3146)
  * Worked around a bug in AMD's Windows driver as well as AMDVLK that would
    cause numerous games to crash since DXVK 2.0. (#3172)
  * Fewer threads will be used to perform background optimization of graphics pipeines.
    This may result in a smoother gameplay experience on some systems.
  * Ashes of the Singularity: Fixed performance regression caused by suboptimal descriptor set allocation.
  * Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Fixed flickering (#3078, PR #3079)
  * Cardfight!! Vanguard: Fixed rendering (PR #3068).
  * Gujian 3: Fixed rendering issues on some GPUs. (#1784)
  * Resident Evil 4 HD: Fixed invalid Vulkan usage causing a GPU hang on RADV. (PR #3089)
  * Saints Row: The Third: Fixed a severe performance issue with rain when using the D3D9 renderer.
    (#2473, PR #3158)
  * Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice: Fixed stuttering issues on Nvidia GPUs. (#3179)
  * Sonic Frontiers: Worked around a game bug that would cause shadows to flicker when GPU-bound.
  * Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance: Fixed a crash after loading (#3058, PR #3060)
  * Note: Due to changes to our DXGI implementation, older versions of vkd3d-proton (prior to 2.8)
    will no longer work with this version of DXVK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  6 15:44:36 UTC 2023 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 2.0
  - Driver compatibility
    A Vulkan 1.3 capable driver and wine version are required to run
    this version of DXVK. See the driver support page for details.

    Many features in this release, especially the shader compilation
    changes detailed below, require the use of modern Vulkan features,
    such as Dynamic Rendering, Extended Dynamic State, and Null
    Descriptors. Due to the significant changes required to make use
    of them, it was no longer practical to maintain and test code paths
    for older drivers which do not support these features.

    In practice, any system capable of running D3D11 and D3D12 games
    using Proton Experimental right now will be able to run DXVK 2.0.

    Note: Third-party Vulkan layers that were not updated for Vulkan 1.3 will no longer work.

    D3D9 changes

    - Memory management improvements

    In order to reduce the likelihood of running out of address space in
    32-bit D3D9 games, DXVK will now use memory-mapped files to store
    shadow copies of textures. This allows us to unmap memory that is
    not being used by the game, thus freeing up significant amounts of
    address space, up to several hundred Megabytes. See PR #2663 for
    implementation details.

    Note: This change does not affect 64-bit games since address space
    is not a concern there. It also does not affect D3D10 or D3D11 since
    resource uploads work differently in those APIs and are much more
    memory efficient.

    Render target feedback loops

    On drivers which support VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout,
    reading from an active render target in D3D9 games is now properly
    supported, which previously caused rendering artifacts on newer AMD
    hardware and required driver-level workarounds. This affects a number
    of games, including GTA IV.

    Alpha test improvements

    The D3D9 alpha test implementation was changed to more closely match
    the behaviour of Nvidia's implementation, which fixes inaccuracies
    in various games. The d3d9.alphaTestWiggleRoom option was removed,
    and games that previously required this option should now work
    correctly by default.

    D3D10 changes

    DXVK previously shipped incomplete implementations of d3d10.dll and
    d3d10_1.dll, but has not installed them by default since Version 1.6
    since wine's implementation provides more features that are needed
    for D3D10 games to run, including the D3D10 Effects framework.

    Since our implementation is incomplete and has not been used by Proton
    or Lutris for a very long time, DXVK will no longer ship these DLLs
    starting with this release. The D3D10 API itself is still supported
    via d3d10core.dll.

    D3D11 changes

    Feature support

    DXVK now exposes D3D11 Feature Level 12_1 with the following newly added features:

    Tiled Resources up to Tier 3, provided that the corresponding Vulkan sparse binding and sparse residency features are supported
    Conservative Rasterization up to Tier 3, provided that the corresponding Vulkan conservative rasterization features are supported.
    Rasterizer Ordered Views, provided that the corresponding Vulkan fragment shader interlock features are supported.

    While no games are known to use these features directly in D3D11, some
    games and game launchers rely on feature support being consistent
    between D3D11 and D3D12 in order to allow users to enable D3D12
    in the game options. While our implementation of these feature is
    generally functional, there may be bugs or performance issues in
    case a game does use them.

    Furthermore, DXVK now supports the D3D11_FEATURE_SHADER_CACHE and
    D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS5 feature queries.

    Note: AMD Vulkan drivers do currently not support fragment shader
    interlock and are limited to feature level 12_0.

    Note: Intel's ANV driver currently does not support the corresponding
    Vulkan features and is therefore limited to feature level 11_1. This
    applies to both DXVK and vkd3d-proton.

    Device contexts

    The implementations of ID3D11DeviceContext were refactored so
    that immediate contexts and deferred contexts no longer use common
    entry points. This is closer to Windows behaviour and may improve
    compatibility to third-party libraries and mods that hook into the
    D3D11 immediate context specifically, and reduces CPU overhead since
    some frequently used code paths are now more specialized for each
    context type.

    State clear and restore methods were optimized to further reduce CPU
    overhead in games that heavily use deferred contexts, e.g. Assassin's
    Creed: Origins, or explicitly call ClearState frequently, e.g. God
    of War.

    Shader compilation changes

    On drivers which support VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library, including
    the IndependentInterpolationDecoration feature, Vulkan shaders will
    now be compiled at the time the game loads its D3D shaders, rather
    than at draw time. This reduces or eliminates shader compile stutter
    in many games.

    In games that load their shaders during loading screens or in the
    menu, this can lead to prolonged periods of very high CPU utilization,
    especially on weaker CPUs. For affected games it is recommended to
    wait for shader compilation to finish before starting the game to
    avoid stutter and low performance. Shader compiler activity can be
    monitored with DXVK_HUD=compiler.

    Note: The relevant Vulkan features are currently only supported
    by Nvidia drivers (version 520.56.06 or later). Driver support is
    expected to improve in the future.

    State cache interactions

    This feature largely replaces the state cache. If the given Vulkan
    features are supported, only pipelines that cannot use the pipeline
    library feature (e.g. pipelines using tessellation shaders) will
    be written to and read from the state cache, so newly created state
    cache files will typically only contain a few dozen to a few hundred
    pipelines, as opposed to thousands or tens of thousands. If the
    graphics pipeline library feature is not supported, the state cache
    will be used the same way as it was in older DXVK versions.

    Note: State cache files created with DXVK versions prior to 1.4.3 can no longer be used.

    Note: Despite our efforts, due to the significant changes under
    the hood, there may be issues when using an older state cache file
    under some circumstances. If you experience crashes, please test
    if the game runs with a clean cache file (DXVK_STATE_CACHE=reset)
    before reporting a bug.

    Caveats

    Games which only load their D3D shaders at draw time (e.g. Witcher 3,
    most Unreal Engine games) will still exhibit some stutter, although
    it should still be less severe than without this feature.

    For 32-bit games, the implementation tries to aggressively free
    Vulkan pipelines in order to save memory. This may cause stutter if
    the driver's on-disk shader cache is not working properly.

    On Nvidia drivers, the on-disk shader cache will be significantly
    larger than with previous versions of DXVK. It may be necessary
    to bypass the size limit by setting the environment variable
    __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SKIP_CLEANUP=1, or setting a new limit manually
    via __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE (in bytes).

    Linux build support

    Work from dxvk-native has been upstreamed in order to facilitate
    native Linux builds of DXVK, which can be used as a drop-in
    replacement to port D3D applications without having to change
    rendering code.

    Note: When porting a D3D11 application, please refer to the Feature
    support and Developer Guidelines pages on the Wiki to avoid hitting
    unsupported or slow code paths in DXVK.

  Mesa. The required wine patches are currently only available in Proton
  Experimental. This feature will not be supported on Windows systems.

  This feature is still experimental and has not been thoroughly tested
  on all graphics drivers, so issues are to be expected. Currently,
  only basic 2D texture sharing between D3D9 and D3D11 is supported
  when using DXVK for both APIs. API features that are currently not
  supported include:

  - IDXGIKeyedMutex. Documentation is very poor and it's not clear how an implementation is supposed to behave.
  - Resource sharing with D3D12 applications under vkd3d-proton. This may be added in the future.
  - Resource sharing with Vulkan applications.

  Note: The Black Mesa UI flickers heavily when the game is not
  GPU-bound. This also happens on Windows to some degree and is a
  game bug.

  Bug fixes and Improvements

  - Added an environment variable DXVK_ENABLE_NVAPI to bypass the vendor ID override. Setting it to 1 behaves exactly the same as setting dxvk.nvapiHack = False in the config file, but may allow for better integration into Lutris or the Proton launch script. (#2544)
  - Improved shader code generation when local arrays are used. This may improve performance on Nvidia drivers in some D3D11 games.
  - Fixed shader code generation when switch-case fallthrough is used in Shader Model 4.0 (#2556). Current FXC versions no longer generate such code.
  - Potentially improved performance when rendering to DXGI_FORMAT_R11G11B10_FLOAT images that can also be used with unordered access views.
  - Fixed various D3D9 issues related to texture uploads (#2559, #2541, #2535).
  - Assassin's Creed 3, Black Flag: Enabled d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = a to work around severe performance issues.
  - Frostpunk: Enabled d3d11.cachedDynamicResources = c to work around low CPU-bound performance.
  - God of War: Fixed some issues that started with game patch 1.0.9:
    -   Extremely inconsistent frame pacing when the game detects an AMD GPU, dxgi.maxFrameLatency = 1 is now set by default to work around this issue.
    -   Heavy flickering of some lights. Apparently this was also fixed in the game in patch 1.0.11.
  - GTA: San Andreas: Fixed UI rendering issues (#2560)
  - Rayman Origins: Fixed rendering issues (#2545)

- updated to 1.10
  ## Performance improvements
  - Reduced unnecessary worker thread synchronization around resource readbacks for both D3D11 and D3D9. This can significantly increase CPU-bound performance in games like **Assassin's Creed: Origins** and other titles built on the same engine, with smaller improvements seen in **Elex II**, **God of War**, **GTA IV** and others.
  - When using [D3D11_MAP_WRITE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_map) on a staging resource that's currently being read by the GPU, DXVK will now attempt to create a copy of that resource in order to avoid GPU synchronization. This improves performance in **Quantum Break** and potentially other games. This behaviour can be tweaked using the `d3d11.maxImplicitDiscardSize` option.
  - Optimized [UpdateSubresource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-updatesubresource) for small constant buffer updates. This further improves performance in **God of War** and potentially other games.
  - Improved the way resource uploads and staging buffers are handled in D3D11. This may reduce memory usage and CPU overhead in some - Added more information to the HUD that can be useful for troubleshooting performance issues: GPU synchronizations per frame, worker thread synchronizations per frame, and pipeline barrier count.
  - GPU synchronization, when necessary, no longer uses busy-waiting, which may reduce power consumption on portable devices in some games.

  ## Bug fixes and Improvements
  - Added a `D3D11On12CreateDevice` stub so applications using this don't immediately crash (PR #2278).
  **Note** that supporting D3D11on12 is currently not viable.
  - Version numbers for Intel's Windows driver should now be reported properly.
  **Note** that using DXVK on this driver is highly discouraged and will likely not work.
  - **ArmA 2**: Fixed texture-related issues (PR #2477).
  - **Black Mesa**: Fixed
  - **Resident Evil 0**, **5**, **6**, **Resident Evil: Revelations 2**: Improved performance (PR #2466).
  - **Total War: Warhammer III**: Significantly improved GPU-bound performance on setups with a dedicated GPU.

  ## Per-game workarounds
  Replaced the previous `d3d11.apitraceMode` option with  `d3d11.cachedDynamicResources`, which provides a more granular way to specify resource types to allocate in cached system memory. Refer to the example `dxvk.conf` for details. This change was not made for the equivalent D3D9 option yet.

  Normally, [D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_usage) resources are expected to be write-only from the CPU and read-only from the GPU, but despite this, some games perform CPU-side reads on the mapped memory, which can cause severe performance degradation since those reads would have to go over PCI-E, or at least uncached write-combined memory. This is especially problematic on systems with Resizeable BAR and can cause issues even on Windows D3D11 drivers.

  Games that will use this option by default include **Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition** (#2491), **Anno 1800**, **Final Fantasy XIV**, **Nier Replicant**, **The Evil Within** (PR #2522), and all games that previously had `d3d11.apitraceMode` enabled by default.

- updated to 1.9.4
  Bug fixes and Improvements:
  - Fixed an issue that would cause VRAM to not be utilized on RBAR-enabled Nvidia GPUs if the `dxvk.shrinkNvidiaHvvHeap`option is enabled (#2438).
  - Enabled strict D3D9 float emulation by default on future versions of RADV. This may improve both accuracy and GPU-bound performance (PR #2448)..
  - Improved memory allocation behaviour. This may reduce memory usage especially in games that create multiple processes or D3D devices.
  - Removed obsolete options to disable OpenVR support.
  - **God of War**: Enabled performance optimizations and DLSS support. *Note that these changes are already included in Proton Experimental.*

  - **Payday**: Fix flickering reflections (#2259)
  - **Shin Megami Tensei 3**: Fixed hang when entering save room (#2161)
  - **Sine Mora EX**: Added 60 FPS lock (#2261)

- Build only on x86*

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 19 13:34:07 UTC 2021 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- updated to 1.9
  ## Features
  - Implemented basic support for various subsampled YUV texture formats such as NV12, which is used for video playback in some games, as well as basic support for `ID3D11VideoProcessor` APIs
  . This is needed for videos in **Nier Replicant** to play back (#2048), and may also be required for **Contra: Rogue Corps** (#1676). Note that Nier videos currently do not work with Proton
   for other reasons.
  - Implemented Conservative Rasterization for supported GPUs, which allows enabling the Nvidia ShadowLibs option in **Final Fantasy XV** and possibly similar options in other games.
  - Reduced presentation latency by up to one frame under some circumstances. This may help with games that are limited by vertical synchronization, DXGI frame latency settings, or external frame limiters that operate on `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` (PR #2075).
  - Added a frame rate limiter. This is mostly intended as a workaround for games that do not work correctly at high frame rates, but can also be controlled with an environment variable. Check the README for detais.

  ## Device selection
  Software-only Vulkan implementations such as Lavapipe are no longer reported to the application as long as there is a Vulkan-capable GPU present on the system. This should fix issues where games try using Lavapipe over a proper driver on some setups with recent Mesa versions and then crash due to hitting an unsupported texture format.

  Lavapipe can now be used with DXVK by manually setting the `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` environment variable. While some of DXVK's feature requirements have been lifted in order to allow it to run, note that limitations of this driver may still cause some games to crash or render incorrectly, while others (such as The Witcher 3) were tested successfully.

  ## Bug fixes and Improvements
  - Improved texture and buffer uploads in D3D9.
  - Fixed the Origin overlay not showing up when using DXVK's DXGI implementation (#1996).
  - Disabled Wine Gecko/Mono installers showing up when using install script.
  - Disabled a workaround to reduce the amount of random crashes on Nvidia drivers since the underlying driver issue was fixed in the 465.xx releases (#1963), which may improve performance in some games.
  - Fixed precision issues in shaders that do not have the `refactoringAllowed` flag set.
  - Fixed some potential issues around image clears that could lead to artifacting or broken rendering.
  - Fixed an issue where games with upper-case file extensions may create duplicate logs or cache files (#2079).
  - Fixed monitor layout issues when restoring display modes on multi-monitor setup (#2064).
  - Fixed a bug in D3D9 where child windows did not have their positions converted relative to their parents (#1958).
  - Removed workarounds specific to RADV with the LLVM shader compiler. Please use the ACO backend instead (default since Mesa 20.2).
  - Removed `d3d11.enableRtOutputNanFixup` workaround, and enabled that behaviour by default for older RADV versions (prior to Mesa 20.3).
  - Further reduced the size of state cache files. State caches from previous DXVK versions will be converted automatically.
  - Debugging symbols now work in GDB with wine-reload (4kb file alignment)
  - Misc. vector/matrix math fixes and optimizations in D3D9.
  - **Atelier Mysterious Trilogy Deluxe Pack**, **Dal Segno** and **Nights of Azure**: Added the usual white screen workaround (#2035, #2022, #2044).
  - **Days Gone**: Implemented missing DXGI frame statistics functions in order to fix very low frame rates (#2065).
  - **Demon Stone**: Work around the game breaking at >60fps (#2103).
  - **Dragon Quest Builder 2**: Fixed an issue where the game would immediately run out of system memory (PR #1995).
  - **Final Fantasy XIII**, **Spec Ops: The Line**: Fixed a bug with some postprocessing effects on NVIDIA.
  - **GTA IV re-release**: Work around incorrect VRAM amounts being shown when nvapi and atidlxx libraries are not present as it assumes all GPUs to be Intel IGPs with unified memory in that case.
  - **Halo 2**: Fixed fog rendering issues (#2059).
  - **Kohan II**: Fixed out-of-memory crash on startup (#2030).
  - **Nier Replicant**: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around issues with the game running too fast, and enforced full-rate vertical synchronization in order to work around related issues with the game sometimes being stuck at weird frame rates.
  Note that AMD RX 5000 and 6000 series GPUs may need to be put into high performance mode manually in order to fix performance issues caused by aggressive power management.
  - **Second Sight**: Fixed missing UI (#2056).
  - **TrackMania Forever**: Fixed rendering issues introduced in DXVK 1.8.
