  <title>DOM Conformance Test Suite</title>
  <description>The DOM Test Suites (DOM TS) will consist of a number of tests for each
level of the DOM specification. The tests will be represented in an XML
grammar which ensures that tests can easily be ported from the
description format to a number of specific language bindings. This
grammar will be specified in XML Schema and DTD form. The grammar will
be automatically generated from the DOM specifications themselves, to
ensure stability and correctness.</description>
