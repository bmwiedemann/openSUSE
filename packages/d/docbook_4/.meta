  <title>DocBook DTD Version 4.x</title>
  <description>DocBook is a schema. It is particularly well-suited to books and papers
about computer hardware and software (though it is not limited to these
applications at all). This package has SGML- and XML-DTD versions
included. Some versions of DocBook contain also a RELAX NG and W3C
Schema.</description>
