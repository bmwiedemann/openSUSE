  <title>DKIMproxy is an SMTP-proxy that implements the DKIM and DomainKeys standards</title>
  <description>DKIMproxy is an SMTP-proxy that signs and/or verifies emails, using the
Mail::DKIM module. It is designed for Postfix, but should work with any
mail server. It comprises two separate proxies, an &quot;outbound&quot; proxy for
signing outgoing email, and an &quot;inbound&quot; proxy for verifying signatures
of incoming email. With Postfix, the proxies can operate as either
Before-Queue or After-Queue content filters.</description>
