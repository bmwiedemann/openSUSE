-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 12 09:17:57 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.11.1
   * dh_installchangelogs: Ensure that at least four old entries are preserved
     (Closes: #1021467)
   * meson.pm: Use `meson setup` in the configure step rather than just `meson`.
   * Put newest compat level first in documentation
   * Rename debhelper config files to include package name
   * dh_installdebconf: Fix typo in manual page
   * Dh_Lib.pm: `qx_cmd` support env/chdir changes like `doit` (Closes: #1016354)
   * Remove obsolete compat checks in the code
   * dh_dwz: Ensure dwz multifile is owned by root:root when root should be used
   * dh_builddeb: Always pass `--root-owner-group` to `dpkg-deb` for dbgsym packages.
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Provide `mkdirs` to create (non-package) directories.
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Make `install_dir` chown created directories when root should be
     used for debhelper's own commands.  This fixes #1024261 for packages that only
     use debhelper itself. However, third-party debhelper tools may still cause
     packages with incorrect ownership for now if they are run after `dh_fixperms`
     (or `dh_fixperms` is omitted).
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Ensure `install_{file,prog,lib}` uses chown when root should be used.
     Previously, they would skip the `chown` call and rely on `dh_fixperms`
     or `dpkg-deb` to fix the ownership.  However, that could cause issues
     when the helper was run after `dh_fixperms` and install files that
     `dpkg-deb` would not reset ownership of.
   * Install `installsysusers` sequence (to match the provide).
   * dh_installchangelogs: Trim old Debian changelog entries
     automatically.  Distributions can disable this by using
     `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notrimdch`.
   * dh_installchangelogs.t: Force locale to be `C.UTF-8` to
     avoid generating invalid changelog entries under
     non-default locales.
   * meson.pm: Stop providing `MESON_TESTTHREADS` environment
     variable for the install target.  Said variable only
     applies for testing.
   * cmake.pm: Use `cmake --install` in compat 14.
     (Closes: #1020732)
   * docs/PROGRAMMING{,.md}: Rewrite PROGRAMMING into markdown.
   * dh_installsystemduser: Stop masking user units on package
     removal.  They should never have been masked in the first
     place.  See #1021027.
   * dh_installinit: Remove executable bit of init scripts on
     package removal (via preinst).  Related to #1021027.
   * dh_installsystemd: Stop masking system units on package
     removal.  This is no longer necessary with the init scripts
     getting their exec bit cleared on package removal.
     (Closes: #1021027)
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Add `package_type` as a function (extracted
     from `is_udeb`).
   * Dh_Getopt.pm: Fix duplicated `warning` in output for a
     particular warning.
   * dh_assistant: Provide a new `detect-hook-targets` command.
   * dh: Recommend using `dh_assistant detect-hook-targets` for
     checking whether hook targets are correct.
   * dh: Hoist `nodoc` and `nocheck` from `DEB_BUILD_PROFILES`
     into `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS` when they are present in the former
     and absent in the latter.  Emit a warning when doing so to
     aid the user, so they know why this does not work when they
     are later building a package that does not use dh.
     (Closes: #979401)
   * dh: Provide a warning when cross building an `nocheck` is
     absent from `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS` to cross builders, who are
     not experienced with Debian's requirements for
     cross-building.  The warning also recommends activating the
     `cross` build profile and provides a way to disable the
     warning without using `nocheck` (for the special case, where
     people have a system that can run host binaries).
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Fix bug where `addsubstvars` would not respect
     the `--no-act` parameter.
   * dh_perl: For scripts that are detected as perl scripts
     that would trigger a dependency, normalize the shebang line to
     use the same perl as debhelper is run under (/usr/bin/perl
     in Debian, YMMV in derivatives).  (Closes: #904409)
   * dh_assistant: Provide new `log-installed-files` command to
     help users and third-party tools record which files they have
     installed.  Third-party tools should use the
     `--on-behalf-of-cmd` to have their tool name recorded.
     (Closes: #972724)
   * dh_installexamples: Explicitly recommend `examples/*` over
     `examples` as content for the `debian/<pkg>.examples` file
     to avoid the triggering `.../examples/examples` case.
     (Closes: #1000384)
   * debhelper.pod: Clarify the documentation around `-v` +
     `--verbose` vs. `DH_VERBOSE` vs. `DH_QUIET` and `terse`
     from `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS`.  Notably, clarify that `-v`
     and `DH_VERBOSE` provides the same functionality and
     that they do not cause *all* commands to be shown.
     (Closes: #1002464)
   * Update Portuguese translation (Américo Monteiro)
     (Closes: #1019231)
   * autoscripts/postinst-init-tmpfiles: Re-instate runtime check
     before running `systemd-tmpfiles`. However, explicitly check
     for `systemd-tmpfiles` rather than asserting the system was
     booted by systemd. This resolves #1013969 without requiring
     a strict dependency as originally suggested by Guilhem Moulin
     in #1013969.
   * dh_installtmpfiles: Remove the `systemd | systemd-tmpfiles`
     dependency as it is no longer required.  (Closes: #1017441)
   * dh_installsystemd: Ditto.
   * dh_installinit: Ditto.
   * autoscripts/postinst-init-tmpfiles: Only pass `--root` to systemd
     when `DPKG_ROOT` is present (as `--root=/` is different from
     omitting `--root` entirely).
   * autoscripts/postinst-sysusers: Ditto

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 15 09:02:09 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.9
   * d/control: Provide dh-sequence-installsysusers.
   * debhelper.pod: Add missing word "variables".
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Fix in addsubstvar where a value was added when
     it should not have been.  (Closes: #1015263)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  4 16:44:48 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.8
   * dh_perl: Fix incorrect binary versioning caused by a regression
     in 13.3.  Thanks to Niko Tyni for reporting the issue.
     (Closes: #997961)
   * d/control: Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.1 - no changes required.
   * root_sequence.pm: Run `dh_installsysusers` before
     `dh_installtmpfiles` (only affects compat 14 or later).  Thanks
     to Nicholas Brown for the suggestion.  (Closes: #1011099)
   * autoscripts/postinst-init-tmpfiles: Remove runtime check on the
     system having systemd as init system.
   * dh_installtmpfiles: Replace runtime check on the system running
     under systemd in generated `postinst` script with a dependency
     on `systemd | systemd-tmpfiles` added to `${misc:Depends}`.
     Thanks to Guilhem Moulin for the suggestion.  (Closes: #1013969)
   * dh_installsystemd: Ditto.
   * dh_installinit: Ditto.
   * debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist.pod: Correct description for
     the addition of dh_installsysusers in compat 14.
   * meson.pm: Use `meson install` instead of `ninja install` for
     dh_auto_install in compat 14.  Thanks to Andrea Pappacoda for
     the suggestion.  (Closes: #1006805)
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Remove double semi-colon.  (Closes: #1010591)
   * Dh_Lib.pm: _strip_spaces now explicitly returns undef on undef
     argument.
     (Closes: #1010594)
   * cmake.pm: Set FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED to true.  This
     ensures that the `FetchContent` module does not attempt to
     use internet connection.
   * debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist.pod: Update documentation
     for compat 14 change.  (Closes: #1011404)
   * debhelper.pod: Correct link to the new upgrade checklist.
     (Closes: #1012777)
   * dh_installman: Avoid false positive language detection on
     shared libs.
   * Update Portuguese translation (Américo Monteiro)
     (Closes: #1011256)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 14:33:58 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.7.1
   * debhelper.pod: Fix several typos.  Thanks to Guillem Jover
     for pointing them out and proposing corrections.
   * dh_installalternatives: Correct a file check that caused
     false-positive rejections of valid alternatives files.  Thanks to
     Hiroyuki YAMAMORI for reporting the bug and providing an initial
     patch.  (Closes: #1009844)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 14:24:56 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.7
   * dh_installalternatives: Improve validation of alternative files to
     catch some "obvious" copy-waste mistakes.
   * dh: Invoke dh_installalternatives after dh_link in compat 14 or
     later. Thanks to Colin Watson for the suggestion.
     (Closes: #1002800)
   * cmake.pm: Drop -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=on in compat v14.  Thanks to
     Vagrant Cascadian for the suggestion and the investigative work on
     this topic.  (Closes: #1004939)
   * debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist.pod: New file.
   * debhelper.pod: Move list of supported compat levels and the related
     upgrade checklist into debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist.pod.
     This means you now need `man 7 debhelper-compat-upgrade-checklist`
     to see the upgrade checklist.
   * dh_installdebconf: Support -D/--define command line parameters
     (mirroring those from dh_installdeb).
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Cope with "?=" as assignment operator in substvars files
     to be future proof with (possible) planned addition of "optional
     substvars.  At the moment, debhelper will still always use "=" when
     adding a substvar but it will now preserve "?=" operator if an
     existing substvar is modified.
   * autoconf.pm: Add support for autotest test suites by passing the
     TESTSUITEFLAGS environment variable to `make test`.
   * Rewrite handling of stop services to use the `preinst` when using
     --no-restart-after-upgrade.  This fixes a regression caused by
     the fix for #989155.  (Closes: #994204)
   * dh_installmenu: Respect DPKG_ROOT when checking for update-menus.
     Note this implementation assumes update-menus is present both
     inside and outside the chroot to activate.  If it is absent on
     either side, the update-menus call is skipped.
   * dh_installsysusers: Invoke systemd-sysusers even when DPKG_ROOT
     is set (relying on `--root`).
   * dh_installpam: In compat 14, install pam snippets into
     `/usr/lib/pam.d` instead of `/etc/pam.d`.  Remember to remove
     (now) obsolete conffiles when you bump to compat 14.
   * debhelper.pod: Correct spelling of DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  3 10:46:23 UTC 2022 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.6
  * dh_assistant: Avoid creating `debian/.debhelper` when the
    which-build-system sub command is invoked.  Thanks to
    Jelmer Vernooĳ for spotting that bug.
  * dh_assistant: Add new active-compat-level command, which
    outputs information about which compat level is declared
    and active.  It also tells how the compat level was
    declared.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Add new function, get_non_binnmu_date_epoch,
    only needed for dh_strip_nondeterminism.
  * dh_installcron: Add support for `cron.yearly` packaging
    file.  Thanks to Martin-Éric Racine for the suggestion.
    (Closes: #1000363)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Remove support for compat 5 and 6.
  * debhelper.pod,debhelper-obsolete-compat.pod: Update to
    reflect the new status for compat 5 and 6.
  * dh: Add missing _ in execute_after example in POD.
  * dh_compress: Exclude .woff and .woff2 by default.
  * Update Portuguese translation (Américo Monteiro)
    (Closes: #1000719)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 18 10:28:08 UTC 2021 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.5.2
   * dh_installsystemd: Revert change to deploy systemd files into
     usr/lib/systemd.  (Closes: #993316, #993759)
   * dh_installinit: Ditto.
   * dh_systemd_enable: Ditto.
   * dh_systemd_start: Ditto.
   * SequencerUtil.pm: Remove duplicate "-a" option to some commands.
     Thanks to Christoph Berg for reporting the issue.
     (Closes: #971761)
   * dh_installdeb: Revert the change to rewrite `rm_conffiles` into
     `remove-on-upgrade` due to it causing bugs in non-trivial cases.
     (Closes: #994919)
   * dh_installtmpfiles: Add missing option name in POD documentation.
   * cmake.pm: make it possible to override dh provided ctest arguments
   * cmake.pm: Add missing import which broke cmake related builds.
     Thanks to Boyuan Yang for reporting the issue.
     (Closes: #993345)
   * dh_installdeb: Install debian/conffiles in compat 12+ again
     (undoing the compat 12 change saying dh_installdeb would ignore
     this file).  The file can now be using for the activating the
     `remove-on-upgrade` feature from dpkg 1.20.
   * dh_installdeb: Automatically rewrite `rm_conffiles` into the
     new `remove-on-upgrade` feature from dpkg when possible.
   * cmake.pm: Pass `ARGS+=--verbose` to make when running tests
     in the cmake+make variant except when "terse" is in
     DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Thanks to Paul Wise for the suggestion.
     (Closes: #992623)
   * python_support.pm: Remove obsolete dh addon.  It did nothing
     but warn and nothing used it anymore.
   * dh: Document debhelper provided dh addon sequences.
   * single_binary.pm: New dh addon ("single-binary") that explicitly
     activates the "single binary" work flow, where dh_auto_install
     uses debian/<pkg> as default --destdir when there is only a
     single binary package.  It will error out if used in a
     source package building multiple binary packages.
   * dh: Activate "single-binary" addon by default in compat levels
     up to and including compat 14 when the source package only lists
     one binary package in debian/control.  In compat 14, emit a warning
     when this happens implicitly requesting users to explicitly enable
     or disable the addon for single binary source packages to avoid
     surprises in compat 15.
   * dh_auto_install: In compat 15, remove special-case default for
     --destdir for single binary source packages.  If the previous
     default is desired, please use the "single-binary" dh addon or
     explicitly pass --destdir to dh_auto_install.
     (Closes: #971432)
   * debian/control: Provide dh-sequence-single-binary.
   * debhelper.pod: Document the dh_auto_install will change behaviour
     in compat 15 for single binary packages and dh will warning about
     that in compat 14.
   * dh_assistant: New tool for assisting third-party tools.  At the
     moment, it primarily supports introspection related features but
     will hopefully be extended to support more use cases.
     (Closes: #984900)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 18 09:14:43 UTC 2021 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- Update to version 13.4.1
   * autoscripts/*: Replace `which` with `command -v`.
   * dh_installsystemd: Only merge /lib/systemd/system into /usr
     for now.  (Closes: #992554)
   * dh_systemd_enable: Ditto.
   * autoscripts/postinst-init-nostart: Call invoke-rc.d when
     a non-empty DPKG_ROOT is used.  (Closes: #992556)
   * Replace "use v5.28" with "use v5.24" in Dh_Lib.pm.
     The change to "use v5.28" in 13.4 broke the test to distinguish 0755
     from "0755" in the reset_perm_and_owner function, breaking builds.
     Thanks Adrian Bunk and Ansgar for help isolating the problem.
   * debian/changelog: Correct bug number in the 13.4 entry.
   * dh_dwz: run in parallel across packages.  (Closes: !47)
   * Dh_Buildsystems.pm: Add bmake and mkcmake as third-party
     build systems.  (Closes: !46)
   * Dh_Buildsystems.pm: Add golang as a third-party build
     system.  (Closes: #981106)
   * autoscripts/*: Add support for DPKG_ROOT in systemd, tmpusers,
     sysusers and init related snippets.  Based on an initial patch
     from Helmut Grohne.  (Closes: #983566)
   * autoscripts/*: Reorder conditions in some scripts to avoid
     doing a redundant stat call when a script parameter can decide
     to skip it.
   * dh_gconf: Remove the command as it does nothing.
     (Closes: #908845)
   * doc/TODO: Remove reference to dh_gconf.
   * root_sequence.pm: Remove dh_gconf from root sequence and declare
     it as obsolete (causing errors from compat 14 if still referenced
     in hook targets).
   * man/po4a/po4a.cfg: Remove dh_gconf from translations.
   * AddonAPI.pm: The declare_command_obsolete command now accepts an
     "$error_compat" parameter to enable addons to choose which compat
     level that will trigger an error (though it must be minimum 13).
   * doc/PROGRAMMING: Update docs to reflect API change.
   * debhelper.pod: Document that referencing dh_gconf in hook targets
     will cause an error in compat 14.
   * dh_fixperms: Correct permissions of files beneath usr/libexec to
     be executable.  (Closes: #979401)
   * dh_installtmpfiles: Only register tmpfiles ending with ".conf" as
     tmpfiles in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d and /etc/tmpfiles.d.  This ensures
     that dh_installtmpfiles gracefully copes with e.g. README files
     provided by systemd upstream.  (Closes: #986329)
   * dh_installsystemd: Ditto (but only relevant in compat 12 or
     earlier)
   * cmake.pm: Pass -DCMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=OFF to cmake in
     addition to -DCMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=ON as the
     former is intended to replace the latter.  Thanks to Raul Tambre
     for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #988973)
   * Dh_Lib.pm: Bump version requirement to v5.28 to reflect the actual
     requirements (the code was using v5.28 features).  Thanks to
     Sérgio Basto for reporting the issue.
   * dh_missing: Ditto.
   * autoscripts/postinst-init,autoscripts/postinst-systemd-start: Use
     "restart" instead of "start" when starting the services.  This
     ensures a smooth transition from --restart-after-upgrade to
     --no-restart-after-upgrade in dh_installinit and dh_installsystemd.
     Thanks to Ryan Tandy for reporting the issue.
     (Closes: #989155)
   * dh_installsystemd: Remove usage of autoscripts/postinst-systemd-restart
   * dh_installinit: Remove usage of autoscripts/postinst-init-restart
   * autoscripts/autoscripts/postinst-systemd-restart: Removed.
   * autoscripts/postinst-init-restart: Removed
   * dh_installsystemd: Prefer /usr/lib/systemd/ to /lib/systemd.
     (Closes: #987989)
   * dh_systemd_enable: Ditto.
   * dh_systemd_start: Ditto.
   * dh_installinit: Ditto.
   * dh_installsystemd: Merge /lib/systemd into /usr/lib/systemd if both
     are present in the package staging directory (prefering the latter
     in case of conflicts).  (Closes: #987989)
   * dh_systemd_enable: Ditto.
   * perl_build.pm,perl_makemaker.pm: Make debhelper use the same perl
     as it runs under (via Perl's $^X variable) when invoking the
     upstream build system.  (Closes: !40, #966396)
   * Always generate unique doc-base file names based on package name and
     document ID. (Closes: #980903)

    sequence addon interface.
  * perl_build: Fix Build check to honor source directory setting.
  * perl_build: Avoid failing if forced to be used in dh_auto_clean
    when Build does not exist (ie due to being run twice in a row).
  * dh_builddeb: Fix man page typo.
  * dh_installdeb: In udeb mode, support the menutest and isinstallable
    maintainer scripts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  4 09:54:08 CEST 2009 - puzel@novell.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 27 10:28:40 CEST 2009 - puzel@novell.com

- update to debhelper-7.3.8
  * First upload of buildsystems support to unstable.
    Summary: Adds --buildsystem (modular, OO buildsystem classes),
    --sourcedirectory, --builddirectory, and support for cmake
    and ant.
  * python_distutils buildsystem: Build for all supported Python
    versions that are installed. Ensure that correct shebangs are
    created by using `python' first during build and install.
    Also build with python*-dbg if the package build-depends
    on them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 16 12:24:58 CEST 2009 - puzel@novell.com

  * Add a versioned dep on perl-base, to get a version that supports
    GetOptionsFromArray.
  * dh_install: Fix support for the case where --sourcedir=debian/tmp/foo
    is used. Perl was not being greedy enough and the 'foo' was not stripped
    from the destination directory in this unusual case.
  * dh_install: Fix support for the case where debian/tmp is
    explicitly specified in filename paths despite being searched by
    default.
  * dh_install: Add test suite covering the last 5 bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  3 10:48:44 CEST 2009 - puzel@novell.com

- update to debhelper-7.3.1
  * Modular object oriented dh_auto_* buildsystem support,
    contributed by Modestas Vainius
    - dh_auto_* --sourcedirectory can now be used to specify a source
      directory if sources and/or the whole buildsystem lives elsewhere
      than the top level directory.
    - dh_auto_* --builddirectory can now be used to specify a build
      directory to use for out of source building, for build systems
      that support it.
    - dh_auto_* --buildsystem can now be used to override the autodetected
      build system, or force use of a third-party class.
    - dh_auto_* --list can be used to list available and selected build
      systems.
    - Adds support for cmake.
    - For the perl_build build system, Build is used consistently
      instead of falling back to using the generated Makefile.
    - Historical dh_auto_* behavior should be preserved despite these
      large changes..
  * Move two more command-specific options to only be accepted by the commands
    that use them. The options are:
    --sourcedir, --destdir
    If any third-party debhelper commands use either of the above options,
    they will be broken, and need to be changed to pass options to init().
  * Make dh not complain about unknown, command-specific options passed to it,
    and further suppress warnings about such options it passes on to debhelper
    commands. This was attempted incompletely before in version 7.2.17.
  * dh_install: Fix installation of entire top-level directory
    from debian/tmp.
  * dh_install: Handle correctly the case where a glob expands to
    a dangling symlink, installing the dangling link as requested.
  * dh_install: Fix fallback use of debian/tmp in v7 mode; a bug caused
    it to put files inside a debian/tmp directory in the package build
    directory, now that prefix is stripped.
  * dh_shlibdeps: Ensure DEBIAN directory exists, as dpkg-shlibdeps
    prints a confusing warning if it does not.
  * dh_auto_install: Pass --install-layout=deb to setup.py
    to support python 2.6.
  * Allow command-specific options to be passed to commands
    via dh without causing other commands to emit a getopt
    warning or deprecation message.
  * dh_installinfo: No longer inserts install-info calls into
    maintainer scripts, as that is now triggerized. Adds a dependency
    via misc:Depends to handle partial upgrades. Note that while
    dh_installinfo already required that info files had a INFO-DIR-SECTION,
    the new system also requires they have START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY and
    END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY for proper registration. I assume there will be
    some mass bug filing for any packages that do not have that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 09:03:44 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.16
  * dh_gconf: Add missed half of postrm fragment removal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 11 11:33:32 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.15
  * dh_strip, dh_shlibdeps: Add support for OCaml shared libraries.
  * dh_compress: Avoid compressing .svg and .sgvz files, since these
    might be used as images on a html page, and also to avoid needing
    to special case the .svgz extension when compressing svg.
  * dh_scrollkeeper: Now a deprecated no-op.
  * dh_gconf: Remove postrm fragment that handled schema migration
    from /etc to /usr.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 21 12:11:37 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.14

Wed May 13 12:05:11 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

  * Support debian/foo.os files to suppliment previous debian/foo.arch
    file support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 11 14:56:30 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.10

  * dh_auto_configure: Clarify man page re adding configure
    parameters.
  * dh_auto_configure: Pass packlist=0 when running Makefile.PL,
    in case it is a Build.PL passthru, to avoid it creating
    the .packlist file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 15:50:23 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

Tue Apr 21 15:56:49 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.4
  * dh_makeshlibs: Fix --add-udeb, for real

    stable, menu does not need to be explicitly run in maintainer
    scripts, except for packages with menu-methods files.
  * dh_installdocs: No longer add maintainer script code to call
    doc-base, as it supports triggers in stable.
  * dh_bugfiles: New program, contributed by Modestas Vainius.
  * dh: Override LC_ALL, not LANG.
  * dh_installchangelogs: Support -X to exclude automatic installation
    of specific upstream changelogs.
  * Compat level 4 is now deprecated.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Re-add --add-udeb support.
  * dh_shlibdeps: Remove --add-udeb switch (was accidentially added here).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 15:26:28 CET 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- update to debhelper-7.2.2
  * dh_installmodules: Give files in /etc/modprobe.d a .conf
    syntax, as required by new module-init-tools.
  * dh_installmodules: Add preinst and postinst code to handle
    cleanly renaming the modprobe.d files on upgrade.
  * Two updates to conffile moving code from wiki:
    - Support case where the conffile name is a substring of another
      conffile's name.
    - Support case where dpkg-query says the file is obsolete.

    * Add Vcs-Browser field.
    * Ignore unknown options in DH_OPTIONS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 29 17:28:46 CET 2008 - puzel@suse.cz

- update debhelper to 7.1.0
  * dh_installchangelogs: Fall back to looking for changelog files ending
    with ".txt".
  * dh_gencontrol: Ensure misc:Depends is set in substvars to avoid dpkg
    complaining about it when it's empty.
  * dh: Fix typo in example.
  * Allow individual debhelper programs to define their own special options
    by passing a hash to init(), which is later passed on the Getopt::Long.
  * Move many command-specific options to only be accepted by the command
    that uses them. Affected options are:
    -x, -r, -R, -l, -L, -m,
    --include-conffiles, --no-restart-on-upgrade, --no-start,
    --restart-after-upgrade, --init-script, --filename, --flavor, --autodest,
    --libpackage, --add-udeb, --dpkg-shlibdeps-params,
    --dpkg-gencontrol-params, --update-rcd-params, --major, --remove-d,
    --dirs-only, --keep-debug, --version-info, --list-missing, --fail-missing,
    --language, --until, --after, --before, --remaining, --with
  * If any third-party debhelper commands use any of the above options,
    they will be broken, and need to be changed to pass options to init().
  * To avoid breaking rules files that pass options to commands that do not
    use them, debhelper will now only warn if it encounters an unknown
    option. This will be converted back to an error later.

- updated dpkg to 1.10.9, major changes:
  * Make the multiline regex have an upper bound, instead of being
    unbounded, as newer perls have a larger stack frame, which cause them

  * Fix segfault in md5sum if the file being checked doesn't exist.
  * Fix extraction of md5sum in dpkg-scanpackages.
  * Handle directories better in md5sum.
  * Fix several read pass buffer bugs, and a memleak.
  * Fix segfault when --auto-deconfigure is given.
- updated debhelper to 4.1.20, major changes:
  * typo in dh_shlibdeps(1)
  * dh_fixperms: Make sure .pm files are 0644.
  * dh_strip: detect and don't strip debug/*.so files.
  * Various improvements to debhelper(1).
  * Clarified dh_perl man page.
  * Fixed excessive escaping around terms in DH_EXCLUDE_FIND.
