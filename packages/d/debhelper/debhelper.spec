%description
A collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to
automate common tasks related to building debian packages. Programs
are included to install various files into your package, compress
files, fix file permissions, integrate your package with the debian
menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc. Most debian packages use debhelper
as part of their build process.
