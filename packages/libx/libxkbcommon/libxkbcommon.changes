Mon Jan  2 23:38:34 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.5.0
  * Fix crash in `xkbcli interactive-wayland` under a compositor
    which supports new versions of the xdg-shell protocol.
  * New API: XKB_CONTEXT_NO_SECURE_GETENV,
    RXKB_CONTEXT_NO_SECURE_GETENV

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 22 00:09:05 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.4.1
  * Fix compose sequence overriding (common prefix) not working
    correctly. Regressed in 1.2.0.
  * Remove various bogus currency sign (particulary Euro and
    Korean Won) entries from the keysym <-> Unicode mappings.
    They prevented the real keysyms/codepoints for these from
    mapping correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  4 11:51:53 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.4.0
  * In libxkbregistry, variants now inherit iso639, iso3166 and
    brief from parent layout if omitted.
  * In libxkbregistry, skip over invalid ISO-639 or ISO-3166
    entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 10 20:04:05 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.3.1
  * In `xkbcli interactive-x11`, use the Esc keysym instead of
    the Esc keycode for quitting.
  * In `xkbcli how-to-type`, add `--keysym` argugment for how to
    type a keysym instead of a Unicode codepoint.
  * Fix a crash in `xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device` error
    handling given some invalid keymaps. Had regressed in 1.2.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  1 21:36:45 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.3.0
  * `xkbcli list` was changed to output YAML instead of a
    custom format.
  * Fix segmentation fault in case-insensitive
    `xkb_keysym_from_name` for certain values like the empty
    string.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 14 09:16:40 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.2.1 [boo#1184688]
  * Fix `xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device()` failing when the
    keymap contains key types with missing level names, like the
    one used by the `numpad:mac` option in xkeyboard-config.
    (Regressed in 1.2.0.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  3 12:58:03 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.2.0
  * `xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device()` is much faster. It now
    performs only 2 roundtrips to the X server, instead of dozens
    (in first-time calls).
  * Case-sensitive `xkb_keysym_from_name()` is much faster.
  * Keysym names of the form `0x12AB` and `U12AB` are parsed more
    strictly.
  * Compose files now have a size limit (65535 internal nodes).
  * Compose table loading (`xkb_compose_table_new_from_locale()`
    and similar) is much faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  4 21:47:33 UTC 2021 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.1.0
  * Update keysym definitions to latest xorgproto. In particular,
    this adds many special keysyms corresponding to Linux evdev
    keycodes.
  * New XKB_KEY_* definitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 20 12:28:22 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix dependency of libxkbregistry-devel: the devel package must
  require the library libxkbregistry0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 19:07:13 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.3
  * Fix (hopefully) a segfault in xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device()
    in some unclear situation (bug introduced in 1.0.2).
  * Fix keymaps created with xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() do
    not have level names (bug introduced in 0.8.0).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 19:36:21 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.2
  * Fix a bug where a keysym that cannot be resolved in a keymap
    gets compiled to a garbage keysym. Now it is set to
    XKB_KEY_NoSymbol instead.
  * Improve the speed of xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() on
    repeated calls in the same xkb_context().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 12 10:28:13 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.1
  * Make the table output of `xkbcli how-to-type` aligned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  6 19:33:06 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.0
  * Now it is possible to add custom layouts and options at the
    system (/etc) and user (~/.config) level, at least when
    libxkbcommon is in use.
  * libxkbregistry is a C library that lists available XKB
    models, layouts and variants for a given ruleset. This is a
    separate library (.so/.pc files) and aimed at tools that
    provide a listing of available keyboard layouts to the user.
  * Add an `xkbcli` command-line utility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 19 00:48:54 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.10.0
  * Fix quadratic complexity in the XKB file parser.
  * Add $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb to the default search path. If
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, $HOME/.config/xkb is used. If
    $HOME is not set, the path is not added. The XDG path is
    looked up before the existing default search path $HOME/.xkb.
  * Add support for include statements in XKB rules files.
  * Fix bug where the merge mode only applied to the first vmod
    in a "virtual_modifiers" statement.
  * Reject interpret modifier predicate with more than one value.
  * Correctly handle capitalization of the ssharp keysym.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 08:26:29 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.9.1
  * Fix context creation failing when run in privileged processes
    as defined by `secure_getenv(3)`, e.g. GDM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 20 15:08:58 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.9.0
  * Move ~/.xkb to before XKB_CONFIG_ROOT. This enables the user
    to have full control of the keymap definitions, instead of
    only augmenting them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 22 21:58:27 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.4
  * Only changes to the build procedure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  8 11:13:02 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.3
  * New APIs: XKB_KEY_XF86MonBrightnessCycle,
    XKB_KEY_XF86RotationLockToggle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  7 13:49:26 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.2 (boo#1105832)
  * Fix a few NULL-dereferences, out-of-bounds access and undefined
    behavior in the XKB text format parser.
  * CVEs fixed:     CVE-2018-15853, CVE-2018-15854, CVE-2018-15855,
    CVE-2018-15856, CVE-2018-15857, CVE-2018-15858, CVE-2018-15859,
    CVE-2018-15861, CVE-2018-15862, CVE-2018-15863, CVE-2018-15864
- run make check

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 15 20:21:18 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.8.0
  * Added xkb_keysym_to_{upper,lower} to perform case-conversion
    directly on keysyms. This is useful in some odd cases, but
    working with the Unicode representations should be preferred
    when possible.
  * Added Unicode conversion rules for the signifblank and
    permille keysyms.
  * Fixed a bug in the parsing of XKB key type definitions where
    the number of levels were determined by the number of level
    *names*. Keymaps which omit level names were hence
    miscompiled. This regressed in version 0.4.3. Keymaps from
    xkeyboard-config were not affected since they don't omit
    level names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 19 01:30:35 UTC 2017 - jayvdb@gmail.com

- Allow building x11 subpackage on any distribution

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  7 16:29:12 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.7.2
  * Added new keysym definitions from xproto.
  * New APIs: XKB_KEY_XF86Keyboard, XKB_KEY_XF86WWAN,
    XKB_KEY_XF86RFKill, XKB_KEY_XF86AudioPreset.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 18 21:43:43 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.7.1
  * Fixed various reported problems when the current locale is
    tr_TR.UTF-8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 11 19:27:17 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.7.0
  * Added support for different "modes" of calculating consumed
    modifiers. The existing mode, based on the XKB standard, has
    proven to be unintuitive in various shortcut implementations.
  * A new mode, based on the calculation used by the GTK toolkit,
    is added. This mode is less eager to declare a modifier as
    consumed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  8 01:24:14 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.6.1:
  * Add LICENSE to distributed files in tarball releases.
  * Minor typo fix in xkb_keymap_get_as_string() documentation.
- Changes from version 0.6.0:
  * If the XKB_CONFIG_ROOT environment variable is set, it is used
    as the XKB configuration root instead of the path determined at
    build time.
  * Tests and benchmarks now build correctly on OSX.
  * An XKB keymap provides a name for each key it defines.
    Traditionally these names are limited to at most 4 characters,
    and are thus somewhat obscure, but might still be useful
    (xkbcommon lifts the 4 character limit).
  * The new functions xkb_keymap_key_get_name() and
    xkb_keymap_key_by_name() can be used to get the name of a key
    or find a key by name. Note that a key may have aliases.
  * Documentation improvements.
  * New API:
    + xkb_keymap_key_by_name().
    + xkb_keymap_key_get_name().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  2 10:39:38 UTC 2015 - mlin@suse.com

- Requires xkeyboard-config, bsc#952403
  * libxkbcommon should brings xkeyboard-config together always as
    libxkbcommon does not distribute xkb data itself, and especially
    requires xkeyboard-config for any rely on libxkbcommon in the
    minimal system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  3 16:40:03 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.5.0:
* Added support for Compose/dead keys in a new module (included in
  libxkbcommon). See the documentation or the
  xkbcommon/xkbcommon-compose.h header file for more details.
* Improved and reordered some sections of the documentation.
* The doxygen HTML pages were made nicer to read.
* Most tests now run also on non-linux platforms.
* A warning is emitted by default about RMLVO values which are not
  used during keymap compilation, which are most often a user
  misconfiguration. For example, "terminate:ctrl_alt_backspace"
  instead of "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp".
* Added symbol versioning for libxkbcommon and libxkbcommon-x11.
  Note: binaries compiled against this and future versions will not
  be able to link against the previous versions of the library.
* Removed several compatablity symbols from the binary (the API
  isn't affected). This affects binaries which:
  1. Were compiled against a pre-stable (<0.2.0) version of
  libxkbcommon, and
  2. Are linked against the this or later version of libxkbcommon.
  Such a scenario is likely to fail already.
* If Xvfb is not available, the x11comp test is now correctly
  skipped instead of hanging.
* Benchmarks were moved to a separate bench/ directory.
* Build fixes from OpenBSD.
* Fixed a bug where key type entries such as "map[None] = Level2;"
  were ignored.
* New API:
  XKB_COMPOSE_*
  xkb_compose_*

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 11 18:33:56 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add commentary about upcoming symbol version support to
  .spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  9 16:36:07 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Switch to library versioning as described in Shared Library
  Packaging guidelines. This permits installation of multiple
  libxkbcommons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 21 19:31:26 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  + Fixed a bug which caused xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() to
    misrepresent  modifiers for some keymaps.
    https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/issues/9
  + Fixed a bug which caused xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() to
    ignore XKB PrivateAction's.
  + Modifiers are now always fully resolved after
    xkb_state_update_mask(). Previously the given state components
    were used as-is, without considering virtual modifier mappings.
    Note: this only affects non-standard uses of
    xkb_state_update_mask().
  + Added a test for xkbcommon-x11, "x11comp". The test uses the
    system's Xvfb server and xkbcomp. If they do not exist or fail,
    the test is skipped.
  + Fixed memory leaks after parse errors in the XKB yacc parser.
  + The fix required changes which are currently incompatible with
    byacc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 24 15:46:08 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Add symbol versioning to xkbcommon

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 21 12:28:41 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to new upstream release 0.4.2
* Fixed a bug where explicitly passing "--enable-x11" to ./configure
  would in fact disable it (regressed in 0.4.1).
* Added @since version annotations to the API documentation for everything
  introduced after the initial stable release (0.2.0).
* Added a section to the documentation about keysym transformations, and
  clarified which functions perform a given transformation.
* XKB files which fail to compile during keymap construction can no longer
  have any effect on the resulting keymap: changes are only applied when
  the entire compilation succeeds.
  Note: this was a minor correctness issue inherited from xkbcomp.
* Fix an out-of-bounds array access in src/x11/util.c:adopt_atoms()
  error-handling code.
  Note: it seems impossible to trigger in the current code since the input
  size cannot exceed the required size.
- Add back -enable-x11 flag for 1315+

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  9 08:36:24 UTC 2014 - mlin@suse.com

- Add COPYING and NEWS to files list

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  8 06:02:33 UTC 2014 - mlin@suse.com

- Replace %suse_version >= 1320 to 1315 in order to build -x11 package
  for SLE12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  4 01:16:43 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to new upstream release 0.4.1
* Added two new functions, xkb_state_key_get_utf{8,32}(). They
  combine the operations of xkb_state_key_get_syms() and
  xkb_keysym_to_utf{8,32}(), and provide a nicer interface for it
  (espcially for multiple-keysyms-per-level).
* The xkb_state_key_get_utf{8,32}() functions now apply Control
  transformation: when the Control modifier is active, the string
  is converted to an appropriate control character.
  This matches the behavior of libX11's XLookupString(3), and
  required by the XKB specification:
  http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Interpreting_the_Control_Modifier
   fdo#75892
* The consumed modifiers for a key are now calculated similarly
  to libX11. The previous behavior caused a bug where Shift would
  not cancel an active Caps Lock.
* Make xkbcommon-x11 work with the keymap reported by the XQuartz
  X server. fdo#75798
* Reduce memory usage during keymap compilation some more.
* New API:
  xkb_state_key_get_consumed_mods()
  xkb_state_key_get_utf8()
  xkb_state_key_get_utf32()
* Deprecated API:
  XKB_MAP_COMPILE_PLACEHOLDER, XKB_MAP_NO_FLAGS
  use XKB_KEYMAP_NO_FLAGS instead.
- Temporary ommit passing --enable-x11 flag, this release has a bug
  that actually disables x11 if explicitly enabled (fixed upstream,
  but used this approach instead of cherry-picking the patch, for
  the sake of avoiding three new BuildRequires & autoreconf)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  8 17:47:54 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to new upstream release 0.4.0
* Add a new add-on library, xkbcommon-x11, to support creating
  keymaps with the XKB X11 protocol, by querying the X server
  directly. See the xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h header file for
  more details. This library requires libxcb-xkb >= 1.10, and
  is enabled by default. It can be disabled with the --disable-x11
  configure switch. Distributions are encouraged to split the
  necessary files for this library (libxkbcommon-x11.so,
  xkbcommon-x11.pc, xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h) to a separate
  package, such that the main package does not depend on
  X11 libraries.
* Fix the keysym <-> name lookup table to not require huge
  amounts of relocations.
* Fix a bug in the keysym <-> name lookup, whereby lookup
  might fail in some rare cases.
* Reduce memory usage during keymap compilation.
* New API:
  New keysyms from xproto 7.0.25 (German T3 layout keysyms).
  XKB_MOD_NAME_NUM for the usual NumLock modifier.
  xkb_x11_* types and functions, XKB_X11_* constants.
- Add and build new libxkbcommon-x11-0 and libxkbcommon-x11-devel
  packages for openSUSE 13.2 and newer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 17 05:49:07 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 0.3.0
* This introduces the xkb_keymap_new_from_buffer API, relaxes
  restrictions on the xkb_keymap_new_from_names API, introduces
  support for setting default keymaps from the environment, and
  includes several new bugfixes, as well as swathes of testing
  improvements.
