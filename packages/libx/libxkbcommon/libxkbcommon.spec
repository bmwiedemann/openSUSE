%description
xkbcommon is a keymap handling library, which can parse XKB
descriptions (e.g. from xkeyboard-config), and use this to help its
users make sense of their keyboard input. Unfortunately, X11's
requirements mean this is not actually usable for the X server, but it
should be perfectly usable for client toolkits, as well as alternative
windowing systems, compositors and system-level clients such as
Wayland and kmscon.
