  <title>XSL Transformation Library</title>
  <description>This C library allows you to transform XML files into other XML files
(or HTML, text, and more) using the standard XSLT stylesheet
transformation mechanism.

It is based on libxml (version 2) for XML parsing, tree manipulation,
and XPath support. It is written in plain C, making as few assumptions
as possible and sticks closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding.
Although not primarily designed with performance in mind, libxslt seems
to be a relatively fast processor. It also includes full support for
the EXSLT set of extension functions as well as some common extensions
present in other XSLT engines.

The package comes with xsltproc, a command line interface to the XSLT
engine.</description>
