    <comment>libXpresent provides an X Window System client interface to the Present
extension to the X protocol.
The Present extension provides a way for applications to update their window
contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing with the
display refresh and potentially using a more efficient mechanism than
copying the contents of the source pixmap.
The reason for wanting this in Factory is that we need it to be able to
deliver xfwm4 of the upcoming Xfce 4.14 release with Xpresent support as a
fallback where vblank via GLX might not be available
