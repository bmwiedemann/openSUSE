%description
libXpresent provides an X Window System client interface to the
Present extension to the X protocol.

The Present extension provides a way for applications to update their
window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion,
synchronizing with the display refresh and potentially using a more
efficient mechanism than copying the contents of the source pixmap.
