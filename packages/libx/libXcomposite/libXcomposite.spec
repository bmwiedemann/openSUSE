%description
The Composite extension causes a entire sub-tree of the window
hierarchy to be rendered to an off-screen buffer. Applications can
then take the contents of that buffer and do whatever they like. The
off-screen buffer can be automatically merged into the parent window
or merged by external programs, called compositing managers.

Summary:        Development files for the X11 Composite extension library
Group:          Development/Libraries/C and C++
Requires:       %lname = %version

%description devel
The composite extension provides several related mechanisms:
- Per-hierarchy storage: The rendering of an entire hierarchy of
  windows is redirected to off-screen storage.
- Automatic shadow update: When a hierarchy is rendered off-screen,
  the X server provides an automatic mechanism for presenting those
  contents within the parent window.
- Composite overlay window: provides compositing managers with a
  surface on which to draw without interference.
- Parent window clipping: modifies the semantics of parent window
  clipping in the presence of manual redirected children.

This package contains the development headers for the library found
in %lname.
