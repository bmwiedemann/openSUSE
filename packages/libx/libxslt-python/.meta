  <title>Python Bindings for libxslt</title>
  <description>The libxslt-python package contains a module that permits applications
written in the Python programming language to use the interface
supplied by the libxslt library to apply XSLT transformations.

This library allows parsing stylesheets. It uses the libxml2-python to
load and save XML and HTML files. Direct access to XPath and the XSLT
transformation context are possible. Thus it is possible to extend the
XSLT language with XPath functions written in Python.</description>
