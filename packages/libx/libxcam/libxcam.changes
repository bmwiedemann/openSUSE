    - enable 3D-bowl model stitching.
    - support generic Android platform.
    - CPU version of surround view stitching upstream to Android Open Source Project.

  * surround-view OpenCL stitching feature enabled and quality improvement.
    - add dewarp process based on bowl view model in geometry map.
    - support multiple (4) cameras stitching.
    - add new selection method based on clustering in feature match to improve quality of stitching.
    - auto scale in x direction is done and y direction is WIP.
    - quality tune on different datasets, both indoor and outdoor.

  * support standard OpenCL 2.0+ driver (VPG OCL driver)

Mon Sep  4 12:23:19 UTC 2017 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 1.0.0
  * 360 video stitching performance and quality improvement.
    - enable geometry map to improve performance.
    - quality tuned on different resolutions (1080P and 4K).

      of target frame reference to base frame
  * CL framework refine.
    - enable CL argument template instead of member variables in kernel.
    - CL kernel support async mode.
    - image handler take over input/output buffer management from image kernel.
  * prepare libxcam debian package and fix most warnings.
- Remove fix-build-errors.diff which is no longer required
- Increased soname to 1
- The pkgconfig file has been renamed from xcam to libxcam
