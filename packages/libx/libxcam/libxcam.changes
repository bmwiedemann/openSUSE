Thu May 21 14:43:43 UTC 2020 - Aaron Puchert <aaronpuchert@alice-dsl.net>

- Update to version 1.2.2
 * GLES compute framework enabling.
   - enable GL image processing framework.
   - enable features of multi-band blender, geometry remap and data-copy.
 * GLES surround-view stitching enabling.
   - GLES stitching enabled (feature-match may support later).
   - performance optimized on compute shaders.
 * Vulkan compute framework enabling.
   - enabled Vulkan image processing under xcam framework.
   - vk-copy-handler as sample code.
 * suggest OpenCV version [3.0.0 - 3.4.3]
 * support CPU stitching based on dual-const and dual-curve scaling factors.
 * support OpenCL stitching based on auto-scale in vertical 2D-direction.
 * change test-soft-image to test-surround-view
 * Vulkan surround-view stitching enabling.
   - enable features of multi-band blender and geometry remap.
   - enable Vulkan image stitching. (feature-match may support later)
 * Surrond-view texture rendering.
   - enable 3D surround view scene rendering and manipulation.
 * require OpenSceneGraph minimal version 3.3.2
 * DNN inference framwork enabling.
   - enable pedestrian and vehicle detection based on OpenVino
 * OpenCV feature match enabled for image stitching pipeline (GLES/Vulkan/CPU)
   - support three versions of feature match: default, cluster, capi
 * Abstract OpenCV source in ocv module, and build into a separate static library
- Require pkgconfig(opencv), because this still needs OpenCV 3.
- Add allow-newer-opencv.patch: Allow all 3.x.x versions.
- Disable 3alib to prevent compiler errors due to missing linux/atomisp.h.
- Enable Vulkan support.
