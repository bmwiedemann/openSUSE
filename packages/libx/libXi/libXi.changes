  * This release includes fixes for malloc failures and a double
    alignment issue on some machines. XFreeDeviceInfo can now be
    called with NULL and XGetFeedbackControl is more robust in
    the face of a malicious X server sending random data. Plus a
    typo fix in the man page.

Fri Oct 28 23:26:17 UTC 2016 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.8:
  The changes of 1.7.7 are included.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 22 17:34:13 UTC 2015 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.6:
  One significant change here: libXi was using raw serial numbers in event
  cookies, the one read off the wire. All other events don't use that number
  but a Xlib-internal serial number which is similar but not always the same.
  This could cause events to look out of order. With this release, libXi is
  now using the same serial number for event cookies as it uses for all other
  events.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 11 12:09:30 UTC 2015 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.5:
  A couple of important bugfixes that have accumulated over the last
  year.
  + Fix version check in _XIAllowEvents
  + Advance the request buffer by the right amount in XIChangeHierarchy
  + Fix double unlock when _XiCheckExtInit return -1.
  + XIChangeHierarchy: Add missing unlock.
  + Do not return NoSuchExtension casted to pointer as an error.
  + XIGetClientPointer: Return False on error.
  + Fix logic in _XIAllowEvents and prevent double unlock.
  + Refactor XGetExtensionVersion.
  + XIGrabDevice: Unlock display in error path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 18 11:53:44 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.4
  * Fix locking bugs with XIAllowTouchEvents() and XIUngrabTouchBegin() 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 11 09:51:19 UTC 2014 - sndirsch@suse.com

- Update to version 1.7.3
  * Two important patches fixing deadlocks when using XIPassiveGrab
    requests.  You're recommended to updated. Note that we now
    require libX11 1.6, that's a new dependency over 1.7.2 but it's
    over a year old by now anyway.
- added baselibs.conf as source to specfile

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  3 23:20:44 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.2:
  Only one minor change since the RC. Again, this release contains the fixes
  for CVE-2013-1998, CVE-2013-1984 and CVE-2013-1995 so you're encouraged to
  update.
  + Remove check that can never be true.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 12:32:47 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.1.901:
  First and likely only RC for libXi 1.7.2. This one has a bunch of changes
  for CVE-2013-1998, CVE-2013-1984 and CVE-2013-1995. These relate to various
  integer overflows and other corruption that happens if we trust the server
  a bit too much on the data we're being sent.
  On top of those fixes, the sequence number in XI2 events is now set
  propertly too (#64687).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  5 13:51:01 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7.1:
  Only a single fix: including the XFixes header to get the typedef for
  PointerBarrier. Naturally, this adds a pkgconfig build-time dependency on
  XFixes.
  Why? The header shipped with 1.7 typedef'd PointerBarrier. If you #include
  both XI and Xfixes headers, you will end up with a duplicate typedef.
  This is not an issue on gcc >= 4.6 since the two typedef's are the same.
  On earlier versions this will trigger an error. gcc 4.6 -pedantic-errors
  will trigger the same error.

Tue Mar 19 18:19:37 UTC 2013 - jengelh@inai.de

- Use more robust make install call
- Avoid calling fdupes outside of /usr

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  7 01:35:11 UTC 2013 - tobias.johannes.klausmann@mni.thm.de

- Update to version 1.7:
  The feature added in this revision is pointer barrier events and releases.
  Pointer barriers themselves are an XFixes 5 feature, XI 2.3 adds two
  disctinct features to barriers:
  + the ability for clients to get notified if pointer movement is restricted
    by a barrier
  + the ability for clients to allow a pointer to move through a barrier
    after it was constrained by the barrier
  For a more verbose explanation of these features please refer to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  3 04:46:01 UTC 2010 - sndirsch@novell.com

- update to release 1.4.0
  * This version doesn't add new features but has seen numerous
    packaging cleanups and a number of miscellaneous fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  4 16:21:10 UTC 2010 - sndirsch@novell.com

- update to release 1.3.1
  A few minor build system cleanups but I've cherry-picked only
  those that didn't require a macros update for this version. The
  requirements are thus the same as for 1.3.0.
  A couple of random other fixes, most notably two display lock
  fixes. The other fix that's quite prominent is the
  initialization of the extension with a server-specific number of
  events. Previously, libXi 1.3 running against a non-XI2 enabled
  server would result in mishandling of events (pending extension
  initialization order).
- update to release 1.3.2
  Brown paper bag release. Just one commit, fixing up a erroneous
  conflict resolution that resulted in an inverted condition for
  the asciidoc/xmlto checks and an error when building man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  2 17:28:57 CEST 2010 - sndirsch@suse.de

- use real version number instead of the one from X.Org 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
