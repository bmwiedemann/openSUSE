  <title>A multi-pane, detailed-list file manager</title>
  <description>4Pane is a multi-pane, detailed-list file manager. It is designed to
be fully-featured without bloat, and aims for speed rather than visual effects.
In addition to standard file manager features, it offers multiple undo and redo
of most operations (including deletions), archive management including 'virtual
browsing' inside archives, multiple renaming/duplication of files, a terminal
emulator and user-defined tools.
