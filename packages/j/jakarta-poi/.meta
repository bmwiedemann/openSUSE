  <title>Java API To Access Microsoft Format Files</title>
  <description>The POI project consists of APIs for manipulating various file formats
based upon Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format using pure Java.
In short, you can read and write MS Excel files using Java. Soon,
you'll be able to read and write Word files using Java. POI is your
Java Excel solution as well as your Java Word solution. However, we
have a complete API for porting other OLE 2 Compound Document formats
and welcome others to participate. OLE 2 Compound Document Format based
files include most Microsoft Office files such as XLS and DOC as well
as MFC serialization API based file formats.</description>
