  <title>Framebuffer Terminal to Display Japanese Characters</title>
  <description>JFBTERM is a program to display Japanese Kanji characters using the
framebuffer. Similar to the well-known program kon, it uses a terminal
emulator on the console and hooks into its output. But JFBTERM does not
use VGA (like kon does). It uses the framebuffer instead.</description>
