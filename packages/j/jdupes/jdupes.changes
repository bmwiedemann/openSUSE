Tue Dec  6 21:35:51 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.21.1:
  * Reinstate '-I/--isolate' by popular demand; use at your own risk!
  * Expect to lose data if you use this feature. It is strongly susceptible
    to the documented "triangle problem" and absolutely does not protect
    files in each directory from matching with one another. Don't get mad at
    me if you use it and see a cloud of smoke come out of your disk array.
  * Remove '-I/--isolate' which has never worked correctly
  * Fix compiling when NO_HARDLINKS and NO_SYMLINKS are both defined
  * Increased stack size limits to enable deeper recursion without crashing
  * Fixes to make compilation under Cygwin (instead of MSYS2 MinGW) work
  * Remove the temporary '-X help' warning about changes in functionality
  * Some minor under-the-hood changes for future enhancements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 14 22:06:26 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add jdupes_wrapper to speedup symlinks
- add new %suse_symlink_dupes and %suse_hardlink_dupes macros
  which are more descriptive than a %jdupes or %fdupes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 21:54:15 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

  * Interactive deletion now offers "link set" options too
  * Interactive deletion now assumes 'a' when you just hit [ENTER]

  * oom.c/h: change license to Creative Commons 0 (public domain)

- Updated to version 1.19.0:
  * Make -X size[+-=] an inclusion filter instead (CHECK YOUR SHELL
    SCRIPTS).
  * Fix -X noext/only extension matching bugs.
  * Remove deprecated -x/--xsize option and some undocumented
    redundant options.
  * Name sorting is now case-insensitive.

    doesn't work.

    name sorting.

    of sync.
  * Embedded build date option has been removed.
- Changes from version 1.18.2:

    Google Drive FS).

  * Add -X newer/older extfilters to reject files by modification
    date.
- Changes from version 1.17.0:
  * Rewrite dedupe code from scratch, probably fixing all dedupe
    bugs.
  * extfilter: add substring match filter for file paths.
  * Add -u/--printunique option to print all non-duplicates
    (unmatched files).
  * Dedupe-blacklisted kernel version check now happens before
    work is done.
- Changes from version 1.16.0:
  * Add -X noext/onlyext filters to exclude/require specific file
    extension(s).
  * Added in-depth help text for -X/--extfilter (use -X help to
    view).

    disabled.
- Changes from version 1.15.0:
  * Disable single file addition on the command line for safety.
- CHanges from version 1.14.1:
  * Fix some compilation issues.
