- update to 1.21.1:
  * Reinstate '-I/--isolate' by popular demand; use at your own risk!
  * Expect to lose data if you use this feature. It is strongly susceptible
    to the documented "triangle problem" and absolutely does not protect

    me if you use it and see a cloud of smoke come out of your disk array.
  * Remove '-I/--isolate' which has never worked correctly
  * Fix compiling when NO_HARDLINKS and NO_SYMLINKS are both defined
