- Added patches:
  * jaw-quotes.patch
    + Add quotes when adding CFLAGS to JAW_CFLAGS in order to avoid
      that first of the CFLAGS be evaluated as a command

    + Modify java requirement to 1.7, since the code cannot be
      built with source level 1.6 due to a diamond operator
- Modified patch:
  * jaw-avoid-version.patch
    + Completely discard all libtool versioning of the library
    + This library is not linked, only loaded by the java code and
