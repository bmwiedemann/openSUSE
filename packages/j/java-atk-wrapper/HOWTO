Package installs java-atk-wrapper in a JRE-independent way. It is up to each
JRE to make use of it correctly. In general, you want to symlink the shared
object and the jar into somehwere where the JRE can find it and configure the
accessiblity configuration of the JRE to load this.

For OpenJDK, the process looks like this:
ln -s %{_libdir}/java-atk-wrapper/libatk-wrapper.so \
    /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/%{arch}/libatk-wrapper.so
ln -s %{_libdir}/java-atk-wrapper/java-atk-wrapper.jar \
    /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/ext/
echo "assistive_technologies=org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper" \
    >>  /usr/lib/java/jre/lib/accessibility.properties
