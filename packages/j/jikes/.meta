  <description>Jikes(TM) is a compiler that translates Java(TM) source files as
defined in &quot;The Java Language Specification&quot; into the byte code
instruction set and binary format defined in &quot;The Java Virtual Machine
Specification.&quot;

You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, considering
that Sun provides javac free with its SDK. Jikes has four advantages
that make it a valuable contribution to the Java community:

* Open source. Jikes is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI
   Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

* Strictly Java compatible. Jikes strives to adhere to both &quot;The
   Java Language Specification&quot; and &quot;The Java Virtual Machine
   Specification&quot; as tightly as possible and does not support
   subsets, supersets, or other variations of the language. The FAQ
   describes some of the side effects of this strict language
   conformance.

* High performance. Jikes is a high performance compiler, making it
   ideal for use with larger projects.

* Dependency analysis. Jikes performs a dependency analysis on your
   code that provides two very useful features: Incremental builds
   and makefile generation.

Note that you must set CLASSPATH correctly to use jikes.</description>
