- Update to 4.0.5
  * This is a major release, following the removal of the
    'QueueFactory', 'AtomicQueueFactory' and

    These classes are still used for testing, but are not part of
    the release artifacts anymore.
    New unpadded queue variants are also included in this release.
  * Further changes included:
    + Fix table-size long math on very large tables
    + #355 Adher to size semantic for queue emptiness for
      MpscLinkedArrayQueue variants
    + Same code, new bundling post #370
- Removed patches:
  * imports.patch
  * jctools-javadoc.patch
    + not needed anymore

Thu Mar 10 11:43:09 UTC 2022 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to 3.3.0
  * API Changes:
    + Removed MpscLinkedQueue7 and MpscLinkedQueue8 and consolidated
      into parent. This removes the need for the builder method on
      MpscLinkedQueue.
    + Deprecated QueueFactory and spec package classes. These are
      not used by any users AFAICT and are only used for testing
      internally.
    + Removed some internal classes and reduced visibility of
      internal utilities where practical. The @InternalAPI
      tagging annotation is also used more extensively to discourage
      dependency.
    + #226: XADD unbounded mpsc/mpmc queue: highly scalable linked
      array queues
    + New blocking consumer MPSC
  * Bug fixes:
    + #334 NBHMLong iterators do not remove NO_KEY
    + #335 NBHM/Long/Identity iterators only removes keys if values
      have not changed. Now follow JDK convention.
    + #336 MpscBlockingConsumerArrayQueue: fix race writing to
      blocked field
    + #339 'fill' wakeup call can spin forever (or until a consumer
      is blocked again) on MpscBlockingConsumerArrayQueue
    + #319 Relying on test cases provided by #328 we apply the fix
      used for #205 to 'NonBlockingHashMapLong' and
      'NonBlockingIdentityHashMap' to provide 'getAndSet' like
      semantics for put and remove.
    + #330 Fix a 'NonBlockingIdentityHashMap' 'replace' bug. During
      this fix some further work was done to bring the code closer
      in line to the current state of 'NonBlockingHashMap'
    + Use byte fields for padding (avoid upcoming false sharing
      problem in JDK 15+ where field ordering has changed)
    + #289 Add Automatic-Module-Name header to MANIFEST.MF
    + #292 Fix inconsistent isEmpty/poll/peek/offer dynamics for
        SpscLinkedQueue
    + Fixed potential for negative queue size for indexed queues and
      similar issue with isEmpty
    + #296 Fix peek/relaxedPeek race with poll/offer in MC queues
    + #297 Fix inconsistent size of FF based queues causing
        potential size() > capacity()
    + #316 Fix MpscBlockingConsumerArrayQueue::poll(TimeUnit,timeout)
    + #310 Fix MpmcUnboundedXaddArrayQueue::peek/relaxedPeek
      can load "future" elements
    + #209: On Arm7, non-volatile long can have unaligned address
      leading to error
    + #216: Size of SpscGrowableArrayQueue can exceeds max capacity
    + #241: Protect the producer index in case of OutOfMemoryError
    + #244: Long NBHM AssertionError when replacing missing key
    + Fix argument checks on fill/drain methods
    + Fix LGTM warning, potential int overflow bug
  * Enhancements:
    + #326 Xadd queues consumers can help producers
    + #323 Update to latest JCStress (thanks @shipilev )
  * Improvements:
    + Don't mark generated linked atomic queues as final
    + #211: Implement batching methods on MpmcArrayQueue
    + #228: Iterator for MpscArrayQueue and MpscUnboundedArrayQueue
    + Iterator support also available for the *ArrayQueue classes
    + #208: MpscLinkedAtomicQueue can be made not final
    + #237: Add scale to exception message to help debug
      netty/netty#8916
  * New features:
    + #340 MpscBlockingConsumerArrayQueue
    + After long incubation and following a user request (see #321),
      we move counters into core
    + Merging some experimental utils and a #264 we add a
      'PaddedAtomicLong'
    + #314 MpscBlockingConsumerArrayQueue::offerIfBelowThreshold is
      added
- Added patch:
  * imports.patch
    + Fix bug in adding of imports that broke build with
      javaparser >= 2.15.0
