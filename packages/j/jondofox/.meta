  <title>Secure Firefox profile for anonymous web browsing</title>
  <description>JonDoFox is a profile for the Mozilla Firefox web browser or
Firefox ESR (recommended), particularly optimized for anonymous
and secure web surfing. For anonymous surfing you need an
IP changer proxy too. We recommend our proxy tool JonDo.

By default JonDoFox uses restrictive settings for security reasons.
Time by time a website does not work like expected. You may have
a look at our online help for JonDoFox to learn how to deal with
restrictions.

This package contains an secure browser profil for anonymous web browsing.</description>
