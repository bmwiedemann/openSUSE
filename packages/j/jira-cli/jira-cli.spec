%description
JiraCLI is an interactive command line tool for Atlassian Jira that will help
you avoid Jira UI to some extent. This tool is not yet considered complete but
has all the essential features required to improve your workflow with Jira. The
tool started with the idea of making issue search and navigation as
straightforward as possible. The tool now includes all necessary features like
issue creation, cloning, linking, ticket transition, and much more. The TUI is
heavily inspired by the GitHub CLI.
