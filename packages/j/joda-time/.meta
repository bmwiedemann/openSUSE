  <title>Java date and time API</title>
  <description>Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date
and time classes. The design allows for multiple calendar
systems, while still providing a simple API. The 'default'
calendar is the ISO8601 standard which is used by XML. The
Gregorian, Julian, Buddhist, Coptic and Ethiopic systems
are also included, and we welcome further additions.
Supporting classes include time zone, duration, format
and parsing.</description>
