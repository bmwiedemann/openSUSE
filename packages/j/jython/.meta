  <title>A Java implementation of the Python language</title>
  <description>Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented
language Python seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. The
predecessor to Jython, JPython, is certified as 100% Pure Java. Jython
is freely available for both commercial and noncommercial use and is
distributed with source code. Jython is complementary to Java and is
especially suited for the following tasks: Embedded scripting--Java
programmers can add the Jython libraries to their system to allow end
users to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to
the application. Interactive experimentation--Jython provides an
interactive interpreter that can be used to interact with Java packages
or with running Java applications. This allows programmers to
experiment and debug any Java system using Jython. Rapid application
development--Python programs are typically 2-10X shorter than the
equivalent Java program. This translates directly to increased
programmer productivity. The seamless interaction between Python and
Java allows developers to freely mix the two languages both during
development and in shipping products.</description>
