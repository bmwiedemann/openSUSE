  <title>Commons Virtual Filesystem</title>
  <description>Commons VFS provides a single API for accessing various different
   file systems. It presents a uniform view of the files from
   various different sources, such as the files on local disk, on an
   HTTP server, or inside a Zip archive. Some of the features of
   Commons VFS are: * A single consistent API for accessing files of
   different types.

* Support for numerous file system types.

* Caching of file information. Caches information in-JVM, and
   optionally can cache remote file information on the local file
   system.

* Event delivery.

* Support for logical file systems made up of files from various
   different file systems.

* Utilities for integrating Commons VFS into applications, such as a
   VFS-aware ClassLoader and URLStreamHandlerFactory.
