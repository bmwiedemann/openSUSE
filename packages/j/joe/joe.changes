-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 30 14:26:27 UTC 2018 - Enno Gotthold <egotthold@suse.com>

- Add Patch joe-4.6-desktop_files.patch: Desktop Category was wrong.
- Update to version 4.6
   * Upgrade to Unicode 10.0.0. Add configure environment variable that allows
     you select Unicode 8.0.0, 9.0.0 or 10.0.0.
   * Install Gnome .desktop files for JOE. This allows you to use JOE in GUI
     "Open With" mouse actions.
   * Support strikeout and double-underline attributes for the few terminal
     emulators that support them. Use "stricken" and "dunderline" in the syntax
     files, or \s and \z in help screens and status line.
   * Fix bug where JOE would sometimes crash when editing shell scripts. This
     was due to an obscure bug in the syntax highlighter: 'reset' command (used
     for default state) was incorrectly messing with stack.
   * -highlighter_context was missing from many file types, which negated some
     improvements from the previous version.
   * Fixed signed char overflow with old style mouse events in large windows
   * Fix bug where path restart (//) was being applied to block filter command
     prompt. Strange things would happen if you had adjacent slashes in command
     arguments.
   * Allow ~ expansion but suppress path restart (//) in compiler error parsing.
     Restore default handling of SIGPIPE and SIGINT for shell commands. This
     fixes an issue where SIGPIPE doesn't terminate a process as expected, for
     example by the head -n 10 in: ^K R !sh -c 'while :; do echo y; done' |
     head -n 10. This issue only occurred in read/write to !, JOE already did
     the right thing for shell windows and the filter region through shell
     command.
   * Improve screen update algorithm so that spaces at the ends of lines are
     always emitted. This allows them to be preserved when cutting text with
     the mouse from a terminal emulator window.
   * Improve efficiency of screen update algorithm: JOE had been resetting
     attributes such as background color before performing cursor motions
     (probably as work around for bugs in old terminal emulators). This made
     screen update slow when there were many attributes, as with syntax
     highlighting and color schemes. It was also repeatedly emitting ESC [ K.
   * Switch JOE to issue scrolling commands, even at high baud rates (before
     this, JOE issued scrolling commands only at 19200 and below because it
     used to be that simple screen refresh was faster than scrolling in
     terminal emulators. But this is no longer true with complex screens
     involving color schemes, unicode and highlighting).
- Update to version 4.5
   * New color scheme feature, which can be accessed with ^T S or by setting
   * the -colors option.
   * 24-bit color support can be enabled by setting the COLORTERM environment
     variable to truecolor or 24bit.
   * Several schemes included in-the-box:
      * gruvbox by Pavel Pertsev
      * ir_black by Todd Werth
      * molokai by Tomas Restrepo
      * solarized by Ethan Schoonover
      * wombat by Lars H. Nielsen
      * xoria by Dmitriy Y. Zotikov
      * zenburn by Jani Nurminen
  * The current line can be highlighted by pressing ^T U or by enabling the
    -hiline option.
  * The gutter containing line numbers has a dynamic size based on the length
    of the file, rather than a fixed size of 10.
  * Updated all language syntax files to use comment_todo and string/comment
    contexts where appropriate.
  * Now pass character which invoked a macro to each macro step and call. If a
    macro step happens to be the 'type' command, the character which invoked
    the macro will be typed in. For example, this macro will type three 'X's.
    Before this change you got three NULs.
  * type,type,type X
  * Fix exsave: (^K ^X) should close file when a block is present in the
    window, and the file is unmodified (regression from ^C change in 4.2).
  * Fix regex assertions: they were not working because the character before
    the search position was not being loaded.
  * For jmacs: ^Q^J now again inserts \n in the string replace prompt. This
    broke beginning with JOE 4.0.
  * Don't try to open files for writing to check file access. This behaves
    better on unionfs mounts.
  * Fix stray blocks created after find/replace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 15:50:17 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 4.4:
	* Fix segfault due to buffer overrun.  This happens if a line
	  with many backslashes appears in the status line context display.
	* Fix jmacs: ^X ^F and ^X ^B were not working
	* Build fixes for Solaris
	* Improve php highlighter: allow numbers in substitution variable names
	* Unicode tweak: treat private use characters (Co) as printable
	* Dockerfile highlighter: Add Docker new commands from 1.12,
	  mark bad strings in arrays
	* Fix loading external charmaps
- Changes for version 4.3:
	* Improve memory usage by shrinking buffer header size and
	  highlighter state size.
	* Improve performance of status line context display (which shows
	  the first line of the function that the cursor is currently in). 
	  This feature was making JOE very slow on extremely large files with
	  auto indent enabled (typically JSON or XML data files).  Now
	  the syntax highlighter computes the context display (using a new
	  syntax named context.jsf).
	* Add a mode 'title' to enable or disable the status line context
	  display (previously autoindent mode was overloaded to do this).
	* Disable syntax highlighting and context display in very large
	  files
	* Force more appropriate modes when we enter hex dump display:
	  enable overtype, disable autoindent, wordwrap, ansi, picture.
	* Handle middle mouse button in "joe -mouse" mode (before it did
	  nothing).  It's treated as paste (copy region to mouse) as
	  expected.  (patch from Petr Olsak).
	* Do not kill region highlighting during incremental search (patch
	  from Petr Olsak).
	* Negative numbers were not being recognized in blocks
	* PgUp/PgDn would try to scroll menu if the window above is a menu
	  (it should do this only for completion menus associated with
	  prompts)
	* Use 'LC_ALL=C sed' to get JOE to compile in OS X.
	* Forward direction delimiter matching where the delimiters do
	  not begin with special characters (for example in Verilog
	  "begin" / "end") was not working.
	* Get mouse to work in menus: this broke in 4.1
	* Character classes with ranges were not working for UTF-8 (as in \\[a-z])
	* Apply spec highlighting to .spec files
	* Gracefully handle short terminals: fix segfaults which occur when
	  trying to shrink terminal while many windows are on the screen or
	  while turning on help with a short terminal.  Fix similar bugs
	  involving the skiptop option.  JOE now works even if the terminal
	  height is only one line.
- Refresh patches
- Small spec file cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 10:14:54 CEST 2016 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 4.2:
  * New or improved syntax files for the following languages: 

	* Dockerfile

  * Usability Enhancements

	* The top Google help searches for JOE include:

		* How do I save and exit?  The startup copyright notice
		  has been replaced with basic help for beginners

		* How do I dismiss the region highlighting?
		  Changed to Ctrl-C will do it.

		* How do I close all files and exit?  Now Ctrl-K Q does this.

	* Restyle the help screens.
	* Remove time and "Ctrl-K H for help" message from status bar. 
	* Add ^KH for help to search and replace prompts.
	* Provide aborthint and helphint options
	* Enable -noxon by default (disable ^S/^Q flow control).
	* Document ESC X (command prompt) in the help screens.
	* "joe --help" now prints all command line options.

  * Other Enhancements

	* Tags search now tries to find the tags file in parent directories
	  if it does not exist in the current directory and if the TAGS
	  environment variable was not set.
	* Built-in calculator can now print and accept numbers in binary,
	  octal and engineering formats:
		__dec__	12_345
		__eng__	12.345_0e3
		__bin__	0b11_0000_0011_1001
		__oct__	0o3_0071
		__hex__	0x3039

	* Built-in calculator now prints and accepts separating underscores
	  for clarity.

	* Enhanced calculator statistics functions:
		* __dev__ computes standard deviation with full population
		* __samp__ computes standard deviation with sample of population
		* Linear regression analysis.  Select a region of x
		  and y values, then:
			* __lr__(x)   provide estimate of y given x
			* __rlr__(y)  provide estimate of x given y
			* __Lr__, __lR__, __LR__: log, exponential, power regression

	* Calculator region functions now assume the entire buffer if no
	  region is set.
	* Tab completion now works at the calculator prompt (and in all
	  prompts which allow numeric input, such as ^KL- go to line).
	* Make new regex engine (from JOE 4.1) more compatible with the
	  classic engine.  \\y is now shorthand for \\(\\.\\\*\\), so that it does
	  what \\\* did in the old engine.  Also:
		* \\. no longer matches newline.
		* \\\* matches shortest match, not longest match.
	* Add -left and -right options to control the amount scrolling when
	  the cursor moves past the left or right edge of the screen. 

* Bugs fixed

	* Fix use after free bug which shows up as a crash in OpenBSD
	* Fix bug where indent step value was not shown on ^T menu
	* Fix bug where setting margin doesn't work on big-endian systems
	* Fix issue where highest valued unicode character equivalent was
	  not translating to its corresponding 8-bit character.  Effect
	  of this was that Delete key was not working in shell windows in
	  ASCII character set.
	* Standard deviation calculator function was not producing correct
	  results.
	* Allow koi8r and koi8-r for KOI8-R in joe_getcodeset (which is only
	  used if there is no setlocale).
	* Guess_crlf forced UNIX line endings for new files even though
	  crlf was set.  Now crlf is left alone if guess_crlf can not
	  determine the line ending.
	* If cursor was at end of a long line and you switched to hex dump
	  display mode, then hex dump was scrolled.  Now scroll offset is
	  reset when you switch to hex display mode.

- Resynched patches:
  joe-3.3-warnings.patch
  joe-3.7-spec_association.patch
- Update German translations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  4 17:03:55 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 4.1
* JOE can now edit UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE files. It does this by
  converting them to UTF-8 during load and back to UTF-16 during
  save.
* Within JOE, native byte order is called UTF-16 and reversed order
  is called UTF-16R. Changing the encoding (with ^T E) between
  UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-16R will make JOE convert the file to the
  desired encoding on save.
* New regular expression engine, which is a compiled Thompson NFA
  matcher. Now supports alternatives "X\|Y", grouping and submatch
  "a\(inside\)b", repetition ranges "x\{3,5}" for "xxxx\?x\?".
* Unicode 8.0 character class support.
- Use shorter download URL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 17 08:12:37 UTC 2015 - thehejik@suse.com

- Version update to 4.0:
  - JOE now has pop-up shell windows with full terminal emulation
    and shell commands that can control the editor. Hit F1 - F4 to bring up a shell window.
  - See Pop-up shell feature for a full description.
  - The status command (^K SPACE) can now be customized using the same syntax
    as the status bar. Look for smsg and zmsg in joerc to see how to do this.
    parserr (the error parser) will parse only the highlighted block if it's set.
    Before it always parsed the entire buffer.
  - Now there is a per-buffer concept of current directory. This was added to
    make the pop-up shell windows work better, but it's useful in general.
  - At file prompts you can begin a new anchored path without having to delete
    the old one. It means that ~jhallen/foo//etc/passwd is translated to /etc/passwd.
  - Prompt windows are now highighted to indicate which parts of the path are
    being dropped. There is a syntax file for this: filename.jsf
  - The error parser now ignores ANSI sequences (some versions of grep
    color their results, now JOE can still parse it).
  - Temporary messages are now dismissed by keyboard input only. Before, they
    could also be dismissed by shell input.
  - Tags search now supports multiple matches. ^K ; can be configured to
    either provide a menu of the matches or to cycle through them.
  - Tags search will now match on the member name part of member functions
    ('fred' will match 'myclass::fred').
  - Tags search will prepend the path to the tags file file name in the tags
    file. This is important when JOE finds the tags file via the TAGS
    environment variable.
  - Remove ` as quote character from incremental search.
  - Clean up documentation, convert much of it to Markdown.
- Cleanup with spec-cleaner
- Drop languages as they don't work at all
- refreshed patches:
  * joe-3.1-fix_isblanck_argument.patch
  * joe-3.1-terminate_buffer.patch

- Use gettext autoconf macros and makefiles.
- Added complete germen translation.
- Update to 3.7
  Changes in 3.7:
  - backspace/DEL means 'n' in replace prompt for better emacs
    compatibility

  - Menus are now made up of macros instead of options.
    New commands:
		menu	Prompt for a menu to display with tab

    default list has been reduced so that formatting of TeX/LaTeX files
    works better.
  * Highlighting now uses less CPU time and always parses from the beginning
    of the file (the number of sync lines option is deprecated).
  * File selection menu/completion-list is now above the prompt (which is
    more like bash).  Also it is transposed, so that it is sorted by columns
    instead of rows.
  * "Bufed" (prompt for a buffer to edit), works like other file prompt
    commands: it's a real prompt with history and completion.
  * Automatic horizontal left scroll jumps by 5-10 columns.
  * New syntax files: troff, Haskell, Cadance SKILL, REXX, LUA, RUBY.  Many
    of the existing syntax files have been improved.
