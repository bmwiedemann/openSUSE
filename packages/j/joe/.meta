  <title>A Text Editor</title>
  <description>JOE (Joe's Own Editor) is a freeware ASCII editor for UNIX. Joe is
similar to most IBM PC text editors. The keyboard combinations are
similar to WordStar[tm] and Turbo C. Some of Joe's features include:

-full support of termcap and terminfo (useful for device-independent
descriptions to control screen output) -optimized screen refresh like
GNU Emacs (Joe can even be used at 2400 baud) -easy installation with
all features for UNIX integration with vi: a marked block of text can
be filtered through a UNIX command and wherever JOE accepts a filename
parameter, the following can also be substituted:

!command\t\t:to redirect from or to another command

&gt;&gt;filename\t\t:to append onto an existing file

filename,start,size\t:to edit a part of a file or device

-\t\t\t:to use standard input/output

When JOE has several files opened at the same time, each file is
displayed in its own window. Additionally, JOE allows for shell windows
from which the output of the executed commands are saved in a buffer,
automatic filename completion (via TAB), help windows, undo and redo,
and search and replace using regular expressions.</description>
