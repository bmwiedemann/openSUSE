%description
JSON-GLib provides a parser and a generator GObject classes and various
wrappers for the complex data types employed by JSON, such as arrays
and objects.

JSON-GLib uses GLib native data types and the generic value container
GValue for ease of development. It also provides integration with the
GObject classes for direct serialization into, and deserialization from,
JSON data streams.
