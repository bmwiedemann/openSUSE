%description
The Jitter RNG provides a noise source using the CPU execution
timing jitter. It depends on a high-resolution time stamp.

The design of this RNG is given in the documentation found at
http://www.chronox.de/jent.html . This documentation also covers the full
assessment of the SP800-90B compliance as well as all required test code.
