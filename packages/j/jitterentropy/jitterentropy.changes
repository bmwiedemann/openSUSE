- Fix a stack corruption on s390x: [bsc#1209627]
  * Output size of the STCKE command on s390x is 16 bytes, compared
    to 8 bytes of the STCK command. Fix a stack corruption in the
    s390x version of jent_get_nstime(). Add some more detailed
    information on the STCKE command.
  * github.com/smuellerDD/jitterentropy-library/commit/7bf9f85
  * Add jitterentropy-fix-a-stack-corruption-on-s390x.patch

- updated to 3.4.1
 * add FIPS 140 hints to man page
 * simplify the test tool to search for optimal configurations
 * fix: jent_loop_shuffle: re-add setting the time that was lost with 3.4.0
 * enhancement: add ARM64 assembler code to read high-res timer

- updated to 3.4.0
  * enhancement: add API call jent_set_fips_failure_callback as requested by Daniel Ojalvo
  * fix: Change the SHA-3 integration: The entropy pool is now a SHA-3 state.
It is filled with the time delta containing entropy and auxiliary data that does not contain entropy using a SHA update operation. The auxiliary data is calculated by a SHA-3 hashing of some varying state data. The time delta that contains entropy is measured about the SHA-3 hasing of the auxiliary data. This satisfies FIPS 140-3 IG D.K resolutions 4, 6, and 8.
  * enhancement: add CMake support by Andrew Hopkins

- updated to 3.3.1
  * fix: bug fix in initialization logic by Vladis Dronov <vdronov@redhat.com>
  * fix: use __asm__ instead of asm to suit the C11 standard

- added a -devel-static package to be able to link it static.
