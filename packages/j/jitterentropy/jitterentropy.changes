- updated to 3.4.0
  * enhancement: add API call jent_set_fips_failure_callback as requested by Daniel Ojalvo
  * fix: Change the SHA-3 integration: The entropy pool is now a SHA-3 state.
It is filled with the time delta containing entropy and auxiliary data that does not contain entropy using a SHA update operation. The auxiliary data is calculated by a SHA-3 hashing of some varying state data. The time delta that contains entropy is measured about the SHA-3 hasing of the auxiliary data. This satisfies FIPS 140-3 IG D.K resolutions 4, 6, and 8.
  * enhancement: add CMake support by Andrew Hopkins

- updated to 3.3.1
  * fix: bug fix in initialization logic by Vladis Dronov <vdronov@redhat.com>
  * fix: use __asm__ instead of asm to suit the C11 standard

- added a -devel-static package to be able to link it static.
