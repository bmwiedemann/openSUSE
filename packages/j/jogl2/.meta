  <description>The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java Binding for the OpenGL API, and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics to applications written in Java.

JOGL provides full access to the APIs in the OpenGL 1.3 - 3.0, 3.1 - 3.3, â‰¥ 4.0, ES 1.x and ES 2.x specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions. OpenGL Evolution &amp; JOGL (UML) gives you a brief overview of OpenGL, its profiles and how we map them to JOGL.</description>
