  <title>Commons Transaction</title>
  <description>Commons Transaction aims at providing lightweight, standardized, well
tested and efficient implementations of utility classes commonly used
in transactional Java programming. Initially there are implementations
for multi level locks, transactional collections and transactional file
access. There may be additional implementations when the common need
for them becomes obvious. However, the complete component shall remain
compatible to JDK1.2 and should have minimal dependencies.</description>
