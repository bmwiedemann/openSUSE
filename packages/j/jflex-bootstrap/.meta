  <title>Lexical Analyzer Generator for Java</title>
  <description>JFlex is a lexical analyzer generator for Java written in Java. It is 
also a rewrite of the very useful tool JLex which was developed by 
Elliot Berk at Princeton University. As Vern Paxson states for his C/C++ 
tool flex: they do not share any code though.

Design goals The main design goals of JFlex are:

    * Full unicode support
    * Fast generated scanners
    * Fast scanner generation
    * Convenient specification syntax
    * Platform independence
    * JLex compatibility</description>
