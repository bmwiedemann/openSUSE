- Update to version 0.4.1+git.20220705:
  * Fix is_safe_path call to use absolute path rather than
    relative path to execution directory.
  * Fix extraction of files with size greater than one erase block.
  * Remove unnecessary log call.
  * Keep xattr, xref, and summary nodetypes in order to propely
    identify unknown node types.
  * Remove handling of xref nodes, xattr nodes, summary nodes.
  * Use inode indexed dicts for inodes, dirent, and xref entries.
  * Simplify filesystem structure.
  * Fix duplicate inodes handling.
  * Fix support for python 3.10 by pinning python-lzo to 1.14.
  * Better handling of decompression error + simpler endianness
    logging.
  * Memory-mapped file support
  * Add support for LZO compression.
  * Revert the symlink path traversal check as it does not present
    a direct risk to normal end users. Those checks can be
    implemented by other tools where required.
  * Fix path traversal security vulnerability by canonicalizing
    path names of every inodes and discarding inodes with a path
    pointing outside of the extraction directory.
  * Autodetect endianness rather than scan the filesystem twice,
    one for each possible endianness. We make the assumption that
    a JFFS2 has always a fixed endianness and that nodes won't
    switch between endianness in the middle of a filesystem.
  * Add support for JFFS2 old magic signature (0x1984).
  * pin cstruct version to 2.1 so we don't end up with breaking
    API changes in the future. Moving to more recent versions
    should be done manually once it's been tested that jefferson
    still works with the newly released version of cstruct.
  * Fix set_endianness to support cstruct version 2.1.
  * Converted python2 encode("hex") to python3 hex()
  * Switched to lzma in python stdlib
  * Convert to python3.
- Drop patches:
  * 18.patch
  * jefferson-use-pylzma.patch
