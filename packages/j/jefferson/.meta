  <title>JFFS2 filesystem extraction tool</title>
  <description>A JFFS2 filesystem extraction tool written in python.

Features:
 - Big/Little Endian support
 - JFFS2_COMPR_ZLIB, JFFS2_COMPR_RTIME, and
   JFFS2_COMPR_LZMA compression support
 - CRC checks - for now only enforced on hdr_crc
 - Extraction of symlinks, directories, files, and device nodes
 - Detection/handling of duplicate inode numbers. Occurs if multiple
   JFFS2 filesystems are found in one file and causes jefferson
   to treat segments as separate filesystems
