  <title>JavaBeans Activation Framework</title>
  <description>The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the
Java platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to:
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to it;
discover the operations available on it; and instantiate the appropriate
bean to perform the operation(s).
