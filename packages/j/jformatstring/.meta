  <title>Java library for format string checks</title>
  <description>This project is derived from Sun's implementation of java.util.Formatter. It 
is designed to allow compile time checks as to whether or not a use of format 
string will be erronous when executed at runtime.

This code is derived from the OpenJDK implementation, jdk1.7.0-b35. As such, 
it is licensed under the same license as OpenJDK, GPL v2 + the Classpath 
exception.

This project is preliminary, and the API is subject to change. The library 
produced by compiling this project is used by the FindBugs project. To avoid 
any licensing questions due to incompatible licenses (FindBugs is licensed 
under the LGPL), it is broken out as a separate project. While there may be 
some confusion/discussion about the licenses, the FindBugs project does not 
interpret the FindBugs LGPL license to be any stronger than GPL v2 + the 
Classpath exception.</description>
