  <title>JDOM is a Java Representation of an XML Document</title>
  <description>JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML document. JDOM
provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is
lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. It is
an alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both
DOM and SAX.</description>
