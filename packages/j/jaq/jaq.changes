- Update to 1.6.0
  * This version includes a completely rewritten parser which massively 
    increases speed and decreases build time, see #196.
    Furthermore, it allows using keywords as object keys (e.g. {if: 1}.if).

- Update to 1.5.1
  * jaq now respects the NO_COLOR environment variable (#189).

- Update to 1.5.0
  * This release corrects escaping of special characters in strings; 
    in particular, newlines tabs, and quotes (") were not correctly escaped.
  * fixed compilation by replacing library ariadne with codesnake 
  * This release finishes the work started in jaq 1.4 towards making jaq being
     able to process non-JSON values.

- Update to 1.4.0
  * This release brings an exciting new addition: the jaq playground! Unlike 
    the jq playground, the jaq playground runs jq filters on your computer 
    and does not send data to a server to process it there. 
  * The other big change is that when jaq is used as a library, you can now use
    it to process custom types of values. That makes it possible to adapt jaq 
    to process non-JSON data, similarly to fq
  * New command-line options: --indent and --tab by @chutz #153
  * New filters: indices, index, and rindex by @kklingenberg #158 #165
  * Division of strings (string splitting) #167
  * Subtraction of arrays #164
