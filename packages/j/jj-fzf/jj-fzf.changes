- BuildRequire/Require jujutsu >= 0.33.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 19 07:45:36 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 0.33.0:
  * Added:
    - New preflight.sh script dedicated to dependency handling
    - Added version.sh to support Github "Source code" archives
    - Added self extracting jj-fzf.sfx script to release artifacts
    - Added manual page jj-fzf.1.gz to release artifacts
    - Added contrib/jj-foreach.sh to run shell command for each
      commit in a revset
    - Added option to contrib/jj-foreach.sh to not affecting
      descendants
    - Alt-J: inject selected revision as historic commit before @
    - Documented F5 and F11 keybindings
  * Breaking:
    - This release requires jj-0.33.0
    - This release is the last one to support fzf 0.44.1, future
      release
    - will depend on more recent fzf versions
    - Upon start, fzf will now wait for jj log to finish before
      display; if this
    - turns out too slow for some repos, please file an issue and
      request --async
    - Instead of enforcing gsed use, preflight.sh now defines an
      sed() function
    - that proxies gsed if needed. Please file an issue if sed
      problems remain
  * Changed:
    - Pushing to a remote will now also push deleted bookmarks
    - Preserve history when deleting tags or bookmarks
    - (enforces git.abandon-unreachable-commits=false during
      deletion)
    - Added cursor down to swap-commits to follow swapped commit
    - Moved preview and helper into library files (speeds up
      previews)
    - Undo/redo operations in jj-fzf now use jj's built-in commands
    - Use jj-fzf oplog to display the undo stack with â‹¯ undo step
      markers
    - Renamed oplog and oplog-browser commands
  * Fixed:
    - Fixed evolog preview and evolog paging (was broken since
      jj-0.30)
    - Fixed outdated uses of jj --config-toml
    - Fixed broken Github jj-fzf links
    - Fixed lacking DESTDIR for make (un)install
  * Removed:
    - Removed unnecessary all: prefix in jj revset expressions
    - Removed unsed command / key binding for undo marker reset
