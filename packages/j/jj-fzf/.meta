  <title>Text UI for Jujutsu based on fzf</title>
  <description>JJ-FZF is a text UI for jj based on fzf, implemented as a bash shell script. The main view centers around jj log, providing previews for the jj diff or jj obslog of every revision. Several key bindings are available to quickly perform actions such as squashing, swapping, rebasing, splitting, branching, committing, abandoning revisions and more. A separate view for the operations log jj op log enables fast previews of old commit histories or diffs between operations, making it easy to jj undo any previous operation. The available hotkeys are displayed onscreen for simple discoverability. The commands and key bindings can also be displayed with jj-fzf --help and are documented in the wiki: jj-fzf-help</description>
