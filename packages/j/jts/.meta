  <title>Java Topology Suite</title>
  <description>The LocationTech JTS Topology Suite (JTS) is an open source Java software
library that provides an object model for planar geometry together with a
set of fundamental geometric functions. JTS conforms to the Simple Features
Specification for SQL published by the Open GIS Consortium.  JTS is designed
to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics software such as
geographical information systems. It can also be used as a general-purpose
library providing algorithms in computational geometry.
