  <title>JBIG-KIT implements a highly effective data compression algorithm for bi-level high-resolution images such as fax pages or scanned documents</title>
  <description>JBIG-KIT provides a portable library of compression
and decompression functions with a documented interface
that you can include very easily into your image or
document processing software. In addition, JBIG-KIT
provides ready-to-use compression and decompression
programs with a simple command line interface (similar
to the converters found in netpbm).
