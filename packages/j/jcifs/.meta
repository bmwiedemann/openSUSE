  <title>Common Internet File System Client in 100% Java</title>
  <description>The jCIFS SMB client library enables any Java application to remotely
access shared files and directories on SMB file servers(i.e. a
Microsoft Windows &quot;share&quot;) in addition to domain, workgroup, and server
enumeration of NetBIOS over TCP/IP networks. It is an advanced
implementation of the CIFS protocol supporting Unicode, batching,
multiplexing of threaded callers, encrypted authentication,
transactions, the Remote Access Protocol (RAP), and much more. It is
licensed under LGPL which means commercial organizations can
legitimately use it with their proprietary code(you just can't sell or
give away a modified binary only version of the library itself without
reciprocation).</description>
