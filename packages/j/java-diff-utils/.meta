  <title>A Java library for performing the comparison operations between texts</title>
  <description>Diff Utils library is an OpenSource library for performing the comparison operations between texts: computing diffs, applying patches, generating unified diffs or parsing them, generating diff output for easy future displaying (like side-by-side view) and so on.

Main reason to build this library was the lack of easy-to-use libraries with all the usual stuff you need while working with diff files. Originally it was inspired by JRCS library and it's nice design of diff module.

This is originally a fork of java-diff-utils from Google Code Archive.</description>
