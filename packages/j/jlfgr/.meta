  <title>Java look and feel Graphics Repository</title>
  <description>These pages contain a collection of toolbar button graphics. The
graphics have been designed specifically for use with the Java look and
feel. They conform to the Java look and feel Design Guidelines. A set
of attributes accompanies each graphic. This information can easily be
used to create Swing Actions.

As the Human Interface Group, we strive to improve the user experience
for you and your end-users. This graphics repository provides you with
professional quality graphics that will save you development time. Your
end-users benefit by leveraging their knowledge of these graphics and
terminology across different Java look and feel applications.

To provide feedback about the graphics repository, send email to the
Java look and feel Design Team (jlfdesign (at) sun (dot) com).</description>
