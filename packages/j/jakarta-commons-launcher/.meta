  <title>A Cross-Platform Java Application Launcher</title>
  <description>Commons-launcher eliminates the need for a batch or shell script to
launch a Java class. Some situations where elimination of a batch or
shell script may be desirable are:

* You want to avoid having to determining where certain application
   paths are, for example, your application's home directory.
   Determining this dynamically in a Windows batch script is very
   tricky on some versions of Windows or when softlinks are used on
   Unix platforms.

* You want to avoid having to handle native file and path separators
   or native path quoting issues.

* You need to enforce certain system properties, such as
   java.endorsed.dirs when running with JDK 1.4.

* You want to allow users to pass custom JVM arguments or system
   properties without having to parse and reorder arguments in your
   script. This can be tricky or messy in batch and shell scripts.

* You want to bootstrap system properties from a configuration file
   instead of hard-coding them in your batch and shell scripts.

* You want to provide localized error messages, which is very tricky to
   do in batch and shell scripts.</description>
