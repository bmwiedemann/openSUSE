- Update to version 5.1.0:
  * remove patches: 0001-ARM-Don-t-extend-bit-LG_VADDR-to-compute-high-addres.patch
  and 0001-remove-CPU_SPINWAIT.patch.

  New features:
    * Implement transparent huge page support for internal metadata. (@interwq)

    * Allow arena index lookup based on allocation addresses via mallctl. (@lionkov)
    * Allow disabling initial-exec TLS model. (@davidtgoldblatt, @KenMacD)
    * Add opt.lg_extent_max_active_fit to set the max ratio between the size of the active extent selected (to split off from) and the size of the requested allocation. (@interwq, @davidtgoldblatt)
    * Add retain_grow_limit to set the max size when growing virtual address space. (@interwq)
    * Add mallctl interfaces:
    * arena.<i>.retain_grow_limit (@interwq)
    * arenas.lookup (@lionkov)
    * max_background_threads (@djwatson)
    * opt.lg_extent_max_active_fit (@interwq)
    * opt.max_background_threads (@djwatson)
    * opt.metadata_thp (@interwq)
    * opt.thp (@interwq)
    * stats.metadata_thp (@interwq)

  Portability improvements:
    * Support GNU/kFreeBSD configuration. (@paravoid)
    * Support m68k, nios2 and SH3 architectures. (@paravoid)
    * Fall back to FD_CLOEXEC when O_CLOEXEC is unavailable. (@zonyitoo)
    * Fix symbol listing for cross-compiling. (@tamird)
    * Fix high bits computation on ARM. (@davidtgoldblatt, @paravoid)
    * Disable the CPU_SPINWAIT macro for Power. (@davidtgoldblatt, @marxin)
    * Fix MSVC 2015 & 2017 builds. (@rustyx)
    * Improve RISC-V support. (@EdSchouten)
    * Set name mangling script in strict mode. (@nicolov)

    * Modify configure to determine return value of strerror_r. (@davidtgoldblatt, @cferris1000)
    * Make sure CXXFLAGS is tested with CPP compiler. (@nehaljwani)
    * Fix 32-bit build on MSVC. (@rustyx)
    * Fix external symbol on MSVC. (@maksqwe)
    * Avoid a printf format specifier warning. (@jasone)

    * AArch64: Add ILP32 support. (@cmuellner)
    * Add --with-lg-vaddr configure option to support cross compiling. (@cmuellner, @davidtgoldblatt)

  Optimizations and refactors:
    * Improve active extent fit with extent_max_active_fit. This considerably reduces fragmentation over time and improves virtual memory and metadata usage. (@davidtgoldblatt, @interwq)
    * Eagerly coalesce large extents to reduce fragmentation. (@interwq)
    * sdallocx: only read size info when page aligned (i.e. possibly sampled), which speeds up the sized deallocation path significantly. (@interwq)
    * Avoid attempting new mappings for in place expansion with retain, since it rarely succeeds in practice and causes high overhead. (@interwq)
    * Refactor OOM handling in newImpl. (@wqfish)

    * Use sysctl on startup in FreeBSD. (@trasz)
    * Use thread local prng state instead of atomic. (@djwatson)
    * Make decay to always purge one more extent than before, because in practice large extents are usually the ones that cross the decay threshold. Purging the additional extent helps save memory as well as reduce VM fragmentation. (@interwq)
    * Fast division by dynamic values. (@davidtgoldblatt)
    * Improve the fit for aligned allocation. (@interwq, @edwinsmith)
    * Refactor extent_t bitpacking. (@rkmisra)

    * Validate returned file descriptor before use. (@zonyitoo)
    * Fix a few background thread initialization and shutdown issues. (@interwq)
    * Fix an extent coalesce + decay race by taking both coalescing extents off the LRU list. (@interwq)
    * Fix potentially unbound increase during decay, caused by one thread keep stashing memory to purge while other threads generating new pages. The number of pages to purge is checked to prevent this. (@interwq)
    * Fix a FreeBSD bootstrap assertion. (@strejda, @interwq)
    * Handle 32 bit mutex counters. (@rkmisra)
    * Fix a indexing bug when creating background threads. (@davidtgoldblatt, @binliu19)

  Documentation:
    * Add TUNING.md. (@interwq, @davidtgoldblatt, @djwatson)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 12 08:12:04 UTC 2017 - mliska@suse.cz

- Update to version 5.0.1
   Bug fixes:
     * Update decay->nunpurged before purging, in order to avoid potential
       update races and subsequent incorrect purging volume.
       ([37]@interwq)
     * Only abort on dlsym(3) error if the failure impacts an enabled
       feature (lazy locking and/or background threads). This mitigates an
       initialization failure bug for which we still do not have a clear
       reproduction test case. ([38]@interwq)
     * Modify tsd management so that it neither crashes nor leaks if a
       thread's only allocation activity is to call free() after TLS
       destructors have been executed. This behavior was observed when
       operating with GNU libc, and is unlikely to be an issue with other
       libc implementations. ([39]@interwq)
     * Mask signals during background thread creation. This prevents
       signals from being inadvertently delivered to background threads.
       ([40]@jasone, [41]@davidtgoldblatt, [42]@interwq)
     * Avoid inactivity checks within background threads, in order to
       prevent recursive mutex acquisition. ([43]@interwq)
     * Fix extent_grow_retained() to use the specified hooks when the
       arena.<i>.extent_hooks mallctl is used to override the default
       hooks. ([44]@interwq)
     * Add missing reentrancy support for custom extent hooks which
       allocate. ([45]@interwq)
     * Post-fork(2), re-initialize the list of tcaches associated with
       each arena to contain no tcaches except the forking thread's.
       ([46]@interwq)
     * Add missing post-fork(2) mutex reinitialization for
       extent_grow_mtx. This fixes potential deadlocks after fork(2).
       ([47]@interwq)
     * Enforce minimum autoconf version (currently 2.68), since 2.63 is
       known to generate corrupt configure scripts. ([48]@jasone)
     * Ensure that the configured page size (--with-lg-page) is no larger
       than the configured huge page size (--with-lg-hugepage).
       ([49]@jasone)

   New features:
     * Implement optional per-CPU arena support; threads choose which
       arena to use based on current CPU rather than on fixed
       thread-->arena associations. ([59]@interwq)
     * Implement two-phase decay of unused dirty pages. Pages transition
       from dirty-->muzzy-->clean, where the first phase transition relies
       on madvise(... MADV_FREE) semantics, and the second phase
       transition discards pages such that they are replaced with
       demand-zeroed pages on next access. ([60]@jasone)
     * Increase decay time resolution from seconds to milliseconds.
       ([61]@jasone)
     * Implement opt-in per CPU background threads, and use them for
       asynchronous decay-driven unused dirty page purging. ([62]@interwq)
     * Add mutex profiling, which collects a variety of statistics useful
       for diagnosing overhead/contention issues. ([63]@interwq)
     * Add C++ new/delete operator bindings. ([64]@djwatson)
     * Support manually created arena destruction, such that all data and
       metadata are discarded. Add MALLCTL_ARENAS_DESTROYED for accessing
       merged stats associated with destroyed arenas. ([65]@jasone)
     * Add MALLCTL_ARENAS_ALL as a fixed index for use in accessing
       merged/destroyed arena statistics via mallctl. ([66]@jasone)
     * Add opt.abort_conf to optionally abort if invalid configuration
       options are detected during initialization. ([67]@interwq)
     * Add opt.stats_print_opts, so that e.g. JSON output can be selected
       for the stats dumped during exit if opt.stats_print is true.
       ([68]@jasone)
     * Add --with-version=VERSION for use when embedding jemalloc into
       another project's git repository. ([69]@jasone)
     * Add --disable-thp to support cross compiling. ([70]@jasone)
     * Add --with-lg-hugepage to support cross compiling. ([71]@jasone)
     * Add mallctl interfaces (various authors):
          + background_thread
          + opt.abort_conf
          + opt.retain
          + opt.percpu_arena

            time,max_num_thds,num_owner_switch}

   Portability improvements:
     * Improve reentrant allocation support, such that deadlock is less
       likely if e.g. a system library call in turn allocates memory.
       ([72]@davidtgoldblatt, [73]@interwq)
     * Support static linking of jemalloc with glibc. ([74]@djwatson)

   Optimizations and refactors:
     * Organize virtual memory as "extents" of virtual memory pages,
       rather than as naturally aligned "chunks", and store all metadata
       in arbitrarily distant locations. This reduces virtual memory
       external fragmentation, and will interact better with huge pages
       (not yet explicitly supported). ([75]@jasone)
     * Fold large and huge size classes together; only small and large
       size classes remain. ([76]@jasone)
     * Unify the allocation paths, and merge most fast-path branching
       decisions. ([77]@davidtgoldblatt, [78]@interwq)
     * Embed per thread automatic tcache into thread-specific data, which
       reduces conditional branches and dereferences. Also reorganize
       tcache to increase fast-path data locality. ([79]@interwq)
     * Rewrite atomics to closely model the C11 API, convert various
       synchronization from mutex-based to atomic, and use the explicit
       memory ordering control to resolve various hypothetical races
       without increasing synchronization overhead. ([80]@davidtgoldblatt)
     * Extensively optimize rtree via various methods:
          + Add multiple layers of rtree lookup caching, since rtree
            lookups are now part of fast-path deallocation. ([81]@interwq)
          + Determine rtree layout at compile time. ([82]@jasone)
          + Make the tree shallower for common configurations.
            ([83]@jasone)
          + Embed the root node in the top-level rtree data structure,
            thus avoiding one level of indirection. ([84]@jasone)
          + Further specialize leaf elements as compared to internal node
            elements, and directly embed extent metadata needed for
            fast-path deallocation. ([85]@jasone)
          + Ignore leading always-zero address bits
            (architecture-specific). ([86]@jasone)
     * Reorganize headers (ongoing work) to make them hermetic, and
       disentangle various module dependencies. ([87]@davidtgoldblatt)
     * Convert various internal data structures such as size class
       metadata from boot-time-initialized to compile-time-initialized.
       Propagate resulting data structure simplifications, such as making
       arena metadata fixed-size. ([88]@jasone)
     * Simplify size class lookups when constrained to size classes that
       are multiples of the page size. This speeds lookups, but the
       primary benefit is complexity reduction in code that was the source
       of numerous regressions. ([89]@jasone)
     * Lock individual extents when possible for localized extent
       operations, rather than relying on a top-level arena lock.
       ([90]@davidtgoldblatt, [91]@jasone)
     * Use first fit layout policy instead of best fit, in order to
       improve packing. ([92]@jasone)
     * If munmap(2) is not in use, use an exponential series to grow each
       arena's virtual memory, so that the number of disjoint virtual
       memory mappings remains low. ([93]@jasone)
     * Implement per arena base allocators, so that arenas never share any
       virtual memory pages. ([94]@jasone)
     * Automatically generate private symbol name mangling macros.
       ([95]@jasone)

   Incompatible changes:

       hooks. ([96]@jasone)

    typically, and EXTRA_CFLAGS provides a way to specify e.g. 
    -Werror during building, but not during configuration.
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix DSS (sbrk(2)-based) allocation. This regression was first
    released in 4.3.0.
  * Handle race in per size class utilization computation.
    This functionality was first released in 4.0.0.
  * Fix lock order reversal during gdump.
  * Fix/refactor tcache synchronization. This regression was
    first released in 4.0.0.
  * Fix various JSON-formatted malloc_stats_print() bugs.
    This functionality was first released in 4.3.0.
  * Fix huge-aligned allocation. This regression was first
    released in 4.4.0.
  * When transparent huge page integration is enabled, detect
    what state pages start in according to the kernel's current
    operating mode, and only convert arena chunks to non-huge
    during purging if that is not their initial state. 
    This functionality was first released in 4.4.0.
  * Fix lg_chunk clamping for the --enable-cache-oblivious
    --disable-fill case. This regression was first released 
    in 4.0.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  4 12:07:44 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.4.0
  Optimizations:
  * Add extent serial numbers and use them where appropriate as a
    sort key that is higher priority than address, so that the
    allocation policy prefers older extents. This tends to improve
    locality (decrease fragmentation) when memory grows downward.
  * Refactor madvise(2) configuration so that MADV_FREE is detected
    and utilized on Linux 4.5 and newer.
  * Mark partially purged arena chunks as non-huge-page.
    This improves interaction with Linux's transparent huge page
    functionality.

  Bug fixes:
  * Fix size class computations for edge conditions involving
    extremely large allocations. This regression was first
    released in 4.0.0.
  * Remove overly restrictive assertions related to the cactive
    statistic. This regression was first released in 4.1.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 06:52:55 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.3.1
  * Fix a severe virtual memory leak. This regression was first
    released in 4.3.0. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  5 05:46:39 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.3.0
  New features:
  * Add "J" (JSON) support to malloc_stats_print().
  * Add Cray compiler support.

  Optimizations:
  * Add/use adaptive spinning for bootstrapping and radix tree node
    initialization.

  Bugfixes:
  * Fix large allocation to search starting in the optimal size
    class heap, which can substantially reduce virtual memory churn
    and fragmentation.  This regression was first released in 4.0.0. 
  * Fix stats.arenas.<i>.nthreads accounting.
  * Fix and simplify decay-based purging.
  * Make DSS (sbrk(2)-related) operations lockless, which resolves
    potential deadlocks during thread exit.
  * Fix over-sized allocation of radix tree leaf nodes.
  * Fix over-sized allocation of arena_t (plus associated stats) data
    structures.
  * Fix EXTRA_CFLAGS to not affect configuration.
  * Fix a Valgrind integration bug.
  * Disallow 0x5a junk filling when running in Valgrind.
  * Fix a file descriptor leak on Linux.  This regression was
    first released in 4.2.0.
  * Fix static linking of jemalloc with glibc.
  * Use syscall(2) rather than {open,read,close}(2) during boot on Linux.
    This works around other libraries' system call wrappers performing
    reentrant allocation.
  * Fix OS X default zone replacement to work with OS X 10.12.
  * Fix cached memory management to avoid needless commit/decommit
    operations during purging, which resolves permanent virtual
    memory map fragmentation issues on Windows.
  * Fix TSD fetches to avoid (recursive) allocation.  This is relevant to
    non-TLS and Windows configurations.
  * Fix malloc_conf overriding to work on Windows.
  * Forcibly disable lazy-lock on Windows (was forcibly *enabled*).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  9 07:26:13 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.2.1
  * Fix bootstrapping issues for configurations that require
    allocation during tsd initialization (e.g. --disable-tls).
  * Fix gettimeofday() version of nstime_update().
  * Fix Valgrind regressions in calloc() and chunk_alloc_wrapper().
  * Fix potential VM map fragmentation regression.
  * Fix opt_zero-triggered in-place huge reallocation zeroing.
  * Fix heap profiling context leaks in reallocation edge cases. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 13 06:58:21 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.2.0
  * Add the arena.<i>.reset mallctl, which makes it possible to
    discard all of an arena's allocations in a single operation.
  * Add the stats.retained and stats.arenas.<i>.retained statistics.
  * Add the --with-version configure option.
  * Support --with-lg-page values larger than actual page size.
  * Use pairing heaps rather than red-black trees for various hot
    data structures.
  * Streamline fast paths of rtree operations.
  * Optimize the fast paths of calloc() and [m,d,sd]allocx().
  * Decommit unused virtual memory if the OS does not overcommit.
  * Specify MAP_NORESERVE on Linux if [heuristic] overcommit is active,
    in order to avoid unfortunate interactions during fork(2).
  * Fix chunk accounting related to triggering gdump profiles.
  * Link against librt for clock_gettime(2) if glibc < 2.17.
  * Scale leak report summary according to sampling probability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  4 07:30:43 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.1.1
  * Fix hashing functions to avoid unaligned memory accesses
    (and resulting crashes). This is relevant at least to some
    ARM-based platforms.
  * Fix fork()-related lock rank ordering reversals. These reversals
    were unlikely to cause deadlocks in practice except when heap
    profiling was enabled and active.
  * Fix various chunk leaks in OOM code paths.
  * Fix malloc_stats_print() to print opt.narenas correctly.
  * Fix a variety of test failures that were due to test fragility
    rather than core bugs.
- Remove disable_oom_test.patch, fixed upstream.
- Run testsuite in parallel where possible

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 20 12:11:43 UTC 2016 - jslaby@suse.com

- add disable_oom_test.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 29 08:27:44 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 4.1.0
  New features:
  * Implement decay-based unused dirty page purging, a major optimization
    with mallctl API impact. This is an alternative to the existing ratio-based
    unused dirty page purging, and is intended to eventually become the sole 
    purging mechanism. New mallctls:
    + opt.purge
    + opt.decay_time
    + arena.<i>.decay
    + arena.<i>.decay_time
    + arenas.decay_time
    + stats.arenas.<i>.decay_time
  * Add --with-malloc-conf, which makes it possible to embed a default options
    string during configuration. This was motivated by the desire to specify 
    --with-malloc-conf=purge:decay , since the default must remain purge:ratio
    until the 5.0.0 release.
  * Make *allocx() size class overflow behavior defined. The maximum size
    class is now less thanPTRDIFF_MAX to protect applications against numerical
    overflow, and all allocation functions are guaranteed to indicate errors 
    rather than potentially crashing if the request size exceeds the maximum size class.
  * jeprof:
    + Add raw heap profile support.
    + Add --retain and --exclude for backtrace symbol filtering.

  Optimizations:
  * Optimize the fast path to combine various bootstrapping and configuration
    checks and execute more streamlined code in the common case.
  * Use linear scan for small bitmaps (used for small object tracking). 
   In addition to speeding up bitmap operations on 64-bit systems, this reduces
   allocator metadata overhead by approximately 0.2%.
  * Separate arena_avail trees, which substantially speeds up run tree operations.
  * Use memoization (boot-time-computed table) for run quantization. Separate 
    arena_avail trees reduced the importance of this optimization.
  * Attempt mmap-based in-place huge reallocation. This can dramatically speed up
    incremental huge reallocation.

  Incompatible changes:
  * Make opt.narenas unsigned rather than size_t.

  Bug fixes:
  * Fix stats.cactive accounting regression.
  * Handle unaligned keys in hash(). This caused problems for some ARM systems.
  * Refactor arenas array. In addition to fixing a fork-related deadlock, 
    this makes arena lookups faster and simpler.
  * Move retained memory allocation out of the default chunk allocation function,
    to a location that gets executed even if the application installs a custom chunk
    allocation function. This resolves a virtual memory leak.  
  * Fix a potential tsd cleanup leak.
  * Fix run quantization. In practice this bug had no impact unless applications
    requested memory with alignment exceeding one page. 
  * Fix LinuxThreads-specific bootstrapping deadlock. (Cosmin Paraschiv) 
  * jeprof:
    + Don't discard curl options if timeout is not defined. (@djwatson)
    + Detect failed profile fetches. (@djwatson)
 * Fix stats.arenas.<i>.{dss,lg_dirty_mult,decay_time,pactive,pdirty} for --disable-stats case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 25 08:31:08 UTC 2015 - idonmez@suse.com

- Remove jemalloc-fix-32bit-tests.patch, fixed upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 12:24:21 UTC 2014 - idonmez@suse.com

- Add jemalloc-fix-32bit-tests.patch to fix test failures on i586

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 24 12:02:33 UTC 2014 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 3.5.0
  * Add the *allocx() API, which is a successor to the experimental *allocm()
    API.  The *allocx() functions are slightly simpler to use because they have
    fewer parameters, they directly return the results of primary interest, and
    mallocx()/rallocx() avoid the strict aliasing pitfall that
    allocm()/rallocx() share with posix_memalign().  Note that *allocm() is
    slated for removal in the next non-bugfix release.
  * Add support for LinuxThreads.

  * Unless heap profiling is enabled, disable floating point code and don't link
    with libm.  This, in combination with e.g. EXTRA_CFLAGS=-mno-sse on x64
    systems, makes it possible to completely disable floating point register
    use.  Some versions of glibc neglect to save/restore caller-saved floating
    point registers during dynamic lazy symbol loading, and the symbol loading
    code uses whatever malloc the application happens to have linked/loaded
    with, the result being potential floating point register corruption.
  * Report ENOMEM rather than EINVAL if an OOM occurs during heap profiling
    backtrace creation in imemalign().  This bug impacted posix_memalign() and
    aligned_alloc().
  * Fix a file descriptor leak in a prof_dump_maps() error path.
  * Fix prof_dump() to close the dump file descriptor for all relevant error
    paths.
  * Fix rallocm() to use the arena specified by the ALLOCM_ARENA(s) flag for
    allocation, not just deallocation.
  * Fix a data race for large allocation stats counters.
  * Fix a potential infinite loop during thread exit.  This bug occurred on
    Solaris, and could affect other platforms with similar pthreads TSD
    implementations.
  * Don't junk-fill reallocations unless usable size changes.  This fixes a
    violation of the *allocx()/*allocm() semantics.
  * Fix growing large reallocation to junk fill new space.
  * Fix huge deallocation to junk fill when munmap is disabled.
  * Change the default private namespace prefix from empty to je_, and change
    --with-private-namespace-prefix so that it prepends an additional prefix
    rather than replacing je_.  This reduces the likelihood of applications
    which statically link jemalloc experiencing symbol name collisions.
  * Add missing private namespace mangling (relevant when
    --with-private-namespace is specified).
  * Add and use JEMALLOC_INLINE_C so that static inline functions are marked as
    static even for debug builds.
  * Add a missing mutex unlock in a malloc_init_hard() error path.  In practice
    this error path is never executed.
  * Fix numerous bugs in malloc_strotumax() error handling/reporting.  These
    bugs had no impact except for malformed inputs.
  * Fix numerous bugs in malloc_snprintf().  These bugs were not exercised by
    existing calls, so they had no impact.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 22 09:28:50 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 3.4.1
  * Fix a race in the "arenas.extend" mallctl that could cause memory
    corruption of internal data structures and subsequent crashes.
  * Fix Valgrind integration flaws that caused Valgrind warnings about
    reads of uninitialized memory in:
    + arena chunk headers
    + internal zero-initialized data structures
  * Preserve errno during the first allocation.  A readlink(2) call
    during initialization fails unless /etc/malloc.conf exists,
    so errno was typically set during the first allocation prior to this fix.
  * Fix compilation warnings reported by gcc 4.8.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Mar  7 20:50:35 UTC 2013 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to version 3.3.1
  * Fix a locking order bug that could cause deadlock during fork
    if heap profiling were enabled.
  * Fix a chunk recycling bug that could cause the allocator to lose
    track of whether a chunk was zeroed.
  * Fix TLS-related memory corruption that could occur during thread
    exit if the thread never allocated memory.  Only the quarantine
    and prof facilities were susceptible.
  * Internal reallocation of the quarantined object array leaked
    the old array.
  * Reallocation failure for internal reallocation of the quarantined
    object array (very unlikely) resulted in memory corruption.
  * Fix Valgrind integration to annotate all internally allocated
    memory in a way that keeps Valgrind happy about internal data
    structure access.
  * Fix building for s390 systems.
