  <title>A (Strict) FastMath class with 1e-15ish accuracy</title>
  <description>Jafama (Java Fast Math) is a Java library aiming at providing faster versions
of java.lang.Math treatments, at the eventual cost of 1e-15ish accuracy errors
but still handling special cases properly (NaN, +-Infinity, ties, etc.).
It also provides additional features, such as angles normalization methods,
inverse hyperbolic trigonometry, etc.
