-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 10:16:59 UTC 2024 - Soc Virnyl Estela <uncomfy+openbuildservice@uncomfyhalomacro.pl>

- Update to version 1.10.2:
  * JuliaSyntax.jl is now used as the default parser, providing better diagnostics and faster
    parsing. Set environment variable `JULIA_USE_FLISP_PARSER` to `1` to switch back to the old
    parser if necessary (and if you find this necessary, please file an issue).
  * `⥺` (U+297A, `\leftarrowsubset`) and `⥷` (U+2977, `\leftarrowless`) may now be used as
    binary operators with arrow precedence.
  * When a task forks a child, the parent task's task-local RNG (random number
    generator) is no longer affected. The seeding of child based on the parent
    task also takes a more disciplined approach to collision resistance, using
    a design based on the SplitMix and DotMix splittable RNG schemes.
  * A new more-specific rule for methods resolves ambiguities containing Union{} in favor of
    the method defined explicitly to handle the Union{} argument. This makes it possible to
    define methods to explicitly handle Union{} without the ambiguities that commonly would
    result previously. This also lets the runtime optimize certain method lookups in a way
    that significantly improves load and inference times for heavily overloaded methods that
    dispatch on Types (such as traits and constructors).
  * The "h bar" `ℏ` (`\hslash` U+210F) character is now treated as equivalent to `ħ` (`\hbar` U+0127).
  * The `@simd` macro now has more limited and clearer semantics: it only enables reordering and contraction
    of floating-point operations, instead of turning on all "fastmath" optimizations.
    If you observe performance regressions due to this change, you can
    recover previous behavior with `@fastmath @simd`, if you are OK with
    all the optimizations enabled by the `@fastmath` macro.
  * When a method with keyword arguments is displayed in the stack trace view, the textual
    representation of the keyword arguments' type is simplified using the new
    `@Kwargs{key1::Type1, ...}` macro syntax.
  * The mark phase of the garbage collector is now multi-threaded.
  * [JITLink](https://llvm.org/docs/JITLink.html) is enabled by default on
    Linux aarch64 when Julia is linked to LLVM 15 or later versions.
    This should resolve many segmentation faults previously observed on this
    platform.
  * The precompilation process now uses pidfile locks and orchestrates
    multiple julia processes to only have one process
    spend effort precompiling while the others wait. Previously all would
    do the work and race to overwrite the cache files.
  * New option `--gcthreads` to set how many threads will be used by the
  garbage collector.
    The default is `N/2` where `N` is the number of worker threads
    (`--threads`) used by Julia.
  * SparseArrays and SuiteSparse are no longer included in the default system
    image, so the core language no longer contains GPL libraries. However,
    these libraries are still included alongside the language in the standard
    binary distribution.
  * `tanpi` is now defined. It computes tan(π*x) more accurately than
    `tan(pi*x)`.
  * `fourthroot(x)` is now defined in `Base.Math` and can be used to compute
    the fourth root of `x`.  It can also be accessed using the unicode
    character `∜`, which can be typed by `\fourthroot<tab>`.
  * `Libc.memmove`, `Libc.memset`, and `Libc.memcpy` are now defined, whose
  functionality matches that of their respective C calls.
  * `Base.isprecompiled(pkg::PkgId)` has been added, to identify whether a
    package has already been precompiled.
  * `binomial(x, k)` now supports non-integer `x`.
  * A `CartesianIndex` is now treated as a "scalar" for broadcasting.
  * `printstyled` now supports italic output.
  * `parent` and `parentindices` support `SubString`s.
  * `replace(string, pattern...)` now supports an optional `IO` argument to
     write the output to a stream rather than returning a string.
  * `startswith` now supports seekable `IO` streams.
  * The `initialized=true` keyword assignment for `sortperm!` and
    `partialsortperm!` is now a no-op. It previously exposed unsafe behavior.
  * Printing integral `Rational`s will skip the denominator in `Rational`-typed
    IO context (e.g. in arrays).
  * `Pkg.precompile` now accepts `timing` as a keyword argument
    which displays per package timing information for precompilation
  (e.g. `Pkg.precompile(timing=true)`).
  * `AbstractQ` no longer subtypes `AbstractMatrix`. Moreover,
    `adjoint(Q::AbstractQ)` no longer wraps `Q` in an `Adjoint` type,
    but instead in an `AdjointQ`, that itself subtypes `AbstractQ`. This
    change accounts for the fact that typically `AbstractQ` instances
    behave like function-based, matrix-backed linear operators, and
    hence don't allow for efficient indexing. Also, many `AbstractQ`
    types can act on vectors/matrices of different size, acting like a
    matrix with context-dependent size. With this change, `AbstractQ`
    has a well-defined API that is described in detail in the [Julia
    documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#man-linalg-abstractq).
  * Adjoints and transposes of `Factorization` objects are no longer wrapped
    in `Adjoint` and `Transpose` wrappers, respectively. Instead, they are
    wrapped in `AdjointFactorization` and `TranposeFactorization` types,
    which themselves subtype `Factorization`.
  * New functions `hermitianpart` and `hermitianpart!` for extracting the
    Hermitian (real symmetric) part of a matrix.
  * The `norm` of the adjoint or transpose of an `AbstractMatrix` now returns
    the norm of the parent matrix by default, matching the current behaviour
    for `AbstractVector`s.
  * `eigen(A, B)` and `eigvals(A, B)`, where one of `A` or `B` is symmetric
    or Hermitian, are now fully supported.
  * `eigvals/eigen(A, cholesky(B))` now computes the generalized eigenvalues
    (`eigen`: and eigenvectors) of `A` and `B` via Cholesky decomposition
    for positive definite `B`. Note: The second argument is the output of
    `cholesky`.
  * Format specifiers now support dynamic width and precision, e.g. `%*s`
    and `%*.*g`.
  * When stack traces are printed, the printed depth of types in function
  signatures will be limited
    to avoid overly verbose output.
  * The `@test_broken` macro (or `@test` with `broken=true`) now complains
    if the test expression returns a non-boolean value in the same way as
    a non-broken test.
  * When a call to `@test` fails or errors inside a function, a larger
    stacktrace is now printed such that the location of the  test within a
    `@testset` can be retrieved.
  * `code_native` and `@code_native` now default to intel syntax instead
    of AT&T.
  * `@time_imports` now shows the timing of any module `__init__()`s that
    are run.
  * The `@pure` macro is now deprecated. Use `Base.@assume_effects :foldable` instead ([#48682]).

  * Fix checksum checks for suitesparse aarch64. Sources are fetched from the same source.

  * use bundled suitesparse. comment out system suitesparse build requirement
  * comment out openblas development dependencies. use bundled openblas.
  * comment out lapack development dependencies. use bundled lapack.

- Add patch `julia-fix-use_system_csl.patch` so that we can build
  using the option `USE_SYSTEM_CSL=1`.
- Add patch `julia-fix_doc_build.patch` to avoid building the
  documentation even if when the tarball already contains it.
  This seems an upstream bug that is triggered with
  `USE_SYSTEM_CSL=1` together with the previous patch.
- Add options `__provides_exclude` and `__requires_exclude` to
  avoid conflict between the bundled libraries and the system
  ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  because Julia does not support libgit2-1.0 yet (boo#1173180).
- Use bundled version of libdSFMT because Julia uses a patch that is
  not in upstream. Hence, using the system version leads to failures
  related to RNG.
- Add new build dependency `libcurl-devel`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 12:24:50 UTC 2016 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- Version bump to 0.4.6.
    * Bugfix release, no changelog available.
- Re-enable i586 architecture.
    * After the full rebuild caused by gcc6, julia started to
      correctly build against i586 again. The root cause of the
      problem was not identified yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 17:49:43 UTC 2016 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- Due to a bug, it is not possible now to build julia against i586
  with glibc 2.23. The root of the problem has not been determined
  yet. Two bugs were filled in upstream:
    _ https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/16087
    _ https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27548
  Thus, the support for julia in i586 architectures is being
  dropped until this bug is fixed.

Fri Jan 29 14:52:45 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  The application 'julia' must exist only once in the repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 21 11:21:38 UTC 2016 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- Add in _constraints the information to build julia package in a
  machine that supports the following extensions: mmx, sse, sse2,
  sse3, and ssse3. This is necessary because the main package is
  built for core2 architecture to improve the performance. The
  package julia-compat, on the other hand, is built for x86_64 and
  can be used if the user does not support core2 extensions.

- LLVM 3.3 will be bundle for 0.4 branch.
    * LLVM 3.3 will be bundle until upstream change the supported
      version. As it can be seen in upstream issues #9336 and
      #13209, there are still many problems related with LLVM 3.5,
      regarding both the build process and the JIT compiler used
      by Julia. Thus, it is better for now stick with LLVM 3.3.
      For more information, see:
        https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/13208
        https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/9336

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 04:38:14 UTC 2015 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- Version bump to 0.4 branch (0.4.0~rc1).
    * This version needs utf8proc > 1.3. Since it is not available
      in openSUSE yet, it was decided to bundle the selected
      upstream version.
    * This version seems to build correctly with both LLVM 3.5 and
      3.7, which are the versions available in 13.2 and
      Tumbleweed. Thus, it was decided to build julia against
      system LLVM.
    * The build process now requires libgit2 and pcre2.
    * The changes in .spec were obtained from Fedora's
      julia-nightlies.spec.

- Changelog of verion 0.4.0~rc1.
    * The complete list of changes related to this release
      candidate can be seen in:
      https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues?q=milestone%3A0.4.0+is%3Aclosed

    * Note: a changelog with the notable changes between 0.3 and
      0.4 versions are expected in the Julia 0.4 release
      announcement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 14:17:31 UTC 2015 - ronisbr@gmail.com

- Revert: "Build julia using llvm-3_3 package" (Revision 15)
  * The llvm-3_3 package is conflicting with other packages that
    depends on llvm and it turns out that it will need a huge
    amount of work to modify every package spec that depends on
    llvm to circumvent this problem. Thus, by now, the safest
    approach is just bundle the supported llvm version in julia
    package.
