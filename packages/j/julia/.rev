    <comment>- Remove unsatisfactory architectures that does not guaranteed to build.
  It seems x86_64 is the guaranteed to work anyway.
- Specfile cleanup:
  * specify more dependencies
    - openlibm-devel
    - julia-devel or julia-compat-devel which provides libjulia.so
- Some dependencies require to be explicit since Julia uses dlopen
  on it's stdlib and other julia scripts
- Specfile cleanup:
  * Exclude now only bundled libs
    - LLVM, uv, ccalltest, llvmcalltest, openblas with INTERFACE64 enabled,
      libjulia-internal and libjulia-codegen
  * Fdupe only /usr/share/julia.
  * Define some dependencies that are dlopened
- There should be a package libjulia1. 
- CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS use provided %optflags.
- libjulia-compat1 should provide libjulia1 to fulfill soname shlib naming policies.
- Remove unused rpmlints:
  * devel-dependency
- Turn all eol encondings to unix to all files
- Add rpmlint for &quot;W: hidden-file-or-dir /usr/share/julia/stdlib/v1.9/Pkg/test/test_packages/AugmentedPlatform/.pkg&quot;
  That contains julia scripts. Leave it alone.
- fdupes at the end of the install section.

    <comment>- libjulia-compat1_10 provides libjulia1_10. added rpmlint filter
  to workaround rpmlint error on ldconfig_scriptlet
- Update rpmlint.
  * bad-cert.pem is a test file in LibGit2_jll.
- Update specfile.
  * cleanup symlinks. these files should just point starting from buildroot
- The location of libgcc_s is different between leap and tumbleweed.
- Prevent debug-info generation touching precompiled sysimages and caches which will
  invalidate checksum generation
- Update rpmlintrc to ignore some warnings
- Fix dangling symlinks errors
- Inconsistencies on where sbinaries are located in openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed
  has caused leap rpm generation to fail after all the builds done successfully.
- Julia on leap has trouble looking for libgfortran5 so symlinking it to fix it
- Format specfile
- Fix specfile
  * p7zip for tumbleweed
  * p7zip-full for leap
- More cleanup
- Also include OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH=NEHALEM in %{__julia_opts} for system not tumbleweed
- More specfile cleanup
  * Move over some environmental variables into the %{__julia_opts} global rpm var
  * Adjust to support if system is not Tumbleweed. openblas not building because libpthread troubles
- Fix ./julia-libunwind-1.9.patch.
- Cleanup specfile
  * Use autosetup
  * Remove patches that are not needed anymore
    - llvm-link-shared.patch
    - llvm-set-of-custom-patches.patch
    - new-pass-manager.patch
    - support-float16-depending-on-llvm-and-platform.patch
    - use-newpm-asan.patch
    - fix-dependencies-checksums.patch
    - julia-suitesparse-7.patch
    - use-system-libuv-correctly.patch
    - julia-libgit2-1.7.patch
- Update to version 1.10.3:
  * Fix outdated usage of scrubbing for log test failures
  * [REPL] Fix typo in using/import completion
  * Avoid compiler warning about redefining jl_globalref_t
  * yet more atomics &amp; cache-line fixes on work-stealing queue 
  * build: remove extra .a file
  * Bump CSL to 1.1.1 to fix libgomp bug
  * codegen: change tbaa of ptr_phi to tbaa_value
  * Default to the medium code model in x86 linux
  * Remove some duplicates from emitted compilation traces for Julia 1.10
  * Add version string to sysimg triple
  * Add missing GC_POP() in emit_cfunction
  * typeintersect: fix UnionAll unaliasing bug caused by innervars
  * Apply backported changes
    - GC typo fix
    - Add inventory writing via DocumenterInventoryWritingBackport
- Add mpfr-looking-for-gmp-fix.patch
- Cleanup specfile
- Limit to x86_64(-v3) architectures. aarch64 has libquadmath disabled
- Tests are currently broken. Idk how upstream was able to have all their checks green despite
  I using the some bundled dependencies. Other issues are because of hardcoded libraries in
  the jll packages even though their versions are non-impactful to Julia.
- Nghttp, Mbedtls, PCRE, LibGit2, LibSSH, gmp, mpfr, and DSFMT are now using the bundled dependencies.
  * now added to the globally defined _privatelibs
  * ./julia-hardcoded-libs.patch is now updated.
  * the only dependencies that do not require much intervention is libblastrampoline and openlibm
- Update to version 1.10.2:
  * JuliaSyntax.jl is now used as the default parser, providing better diagnostics and faster
    parsing. Set environment variable `JULIA_USE_FLISP_PARSER` to `1` to switch back to the old
    parser if necessary (and if you find this necessary, please file an issue).
  * `⥺` (U+297A, `\leftarrowsubset`) and `⥷` (U+2977, `\leftarrowless`) may now be used as
    binary operators with arrow precedence.
  * When a task forks a child, the parent task's task-local RNG (random number
    generator) is no longer affected. The seeding of child based on the parent
    task also takes a more disciplined approach to collision resistance, using
    a design based on the SplitMix and DotMix splittable RNG schemes.
  * A new more-specific rule for methods resolves ambiguities containing Union{} in favor of
    the method defined explicitly to handle the Union{} argument. This makes it possible to
    define methods to explicitly handle Union{} without the ambiguities that commonly would
    result previously. This also lets the runtime optimize certain method lookups in a way
    that significantly improves load and inference times for heavily overloaded methods that
    dispatch on Types (such as traits and constructors).
  * The &quot;h bar&quot; `ℏ` (`\hslash` U+210F) character is now treated as equivalent to `ħ` (`\hbar` U+0127).
  * The `@simd` macro now has more limited and clearer semantics: it only enables reordering and contraction
    of floating-point operations, instead of turning on all &quot;fastmath&quot; optimizations.
    If you observe performance regressions due to this change, you can
    recover previous behavior with `@fastmath @simd`, if you are OK with
    all the optimizations enabled by the `@fastmath` macro.
  * When a method with keyword arguments is displayed in the stack trace view, the textual
    representation of the keyword arguments' type is simplified using the new
    `@Kwargs{key1::Type1, ...}` macro syntax.
  * The mark phase of the garbage collector is now multi-threaded.
  * [JITLink](https://llvm.org/docs/JITLink.html) is enabled by default on
    Linux aarch64 when Julia is linked to LLVM 15 or later versions.
    This should resolve many segmentation faults previously observed on this
    platform.
  * The precompilation process now uses pidfile locks and orchestrates
    multiple julia processes to only have one process
    spend effort precompiling while the others wait. Previously all would
    do the work and race to overwrite the cache files.
  * New option `--gcthreads` to set how many threads will be used by the
  garbage collector.
    The default is `N/2` where `N` is the number of worker threads
    (`--threads`) used by Julia.
  * SparseArrays and SuiteSparse are no longer included in the default system
    image, so the core language no longer contains GPL libraries. However,
    these libraries are still included alongside the language in the standard
    binary distribution.
  * `tanpi` is now defined. It computes tan(π*x) more accurately than
    `tan(pi*x)`.
  * `fourthroot(x)` is now defined in `Base.Math` and can be used to compute
    the fourth root of `x`.  It can also be accessed using the unicode
    character `∜`, which can be typed by `\fourthroot&lt;tab&gt;`.
  * `Libc.memmove`, `Libc.memset`, and `Libc.memcpy` are now defined, whose
  functionality matches that of their respective C calls.
  * `Base.isprecompiled(pkg::PkgId)` has been added, to identify whether a
    package has already been precompiled.
  * `binomial(x, k)` now supports non-integer `x`.
  * A `CartesianIndex` is now treated as a &quot;scalar&quot; for broadcasting.
  * `printstyled` now supports italic output.
  * `parent` and `parentindices` support `SubString`s.
  * `replace(string, pattern...)` now supports an optional `IO` argument to
     write the output to a stream rather than returning a string.
  * `startswith` now supports seekable `IO` streams.
  * The `initialized=true` keyword assignment for `sortperm!` and
    `partialsortperm!` is now a no-op. It previously exposed unsafe behavior.
  * Printing integral `Rational`s will skip the denominator in `Rational`-typed
    IO context (e.g. in arrays).
  * `Pkg.precompile` now accepts `timing` as a keyword argument
    which displays per package timing information for precompilation
  (e.g. `Pkg.precompile(timing=true)`).
  * `AbstractQ` no longer subtypes `AbstractMatrix`. Moreover,
    `adjoint(Q::AbstractQ)` no longer wraps `Q` in an `Adjoint` type,
    but instead in an `AdjointQ`, that itself subtypes `AbstractQ`. This
    change accounts for the fact that typically `AbstractQ` instances
    behave like function-based, matrix-backed linear operators, and
    hence don't allow for efficient indexing. Also, many `AbstractQ`
    types can act on vectors/matrices of different size, acting like a
    matrix with context-dependent size. With this change, `AbstractQ`
    has a well-defined API that is described in detail in the [Julia
    documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#man-linalg-abstractq).
  * Adjoints and transposes of `Factorization` objects are no longer wrapped
    in `Adjoint` and `Transpose` wrappers, respectively. Instead, they are
    wrapped in `AdjointFactorization` and `TranposeFactorization` types,
    which themselves subtype `Factorization`.
  * New functions `hermitianpart` and `hermitianpart!` for extracting the
    Hermitian (real symmetric) part of a matrix.
  * The `norm` of the adjoint or transpose of an `AbstractMatrix` now returns
    the norm of the parent matrix by default, matching the current behaviour
    for `AbstractVector`s.
  * `eigen(A, B)` and `eigvals(A, B)`, where one of `A` or `B` is symmetric
    or Hermitian, are now fully supported.
  * `eigvals/eigen(A, cholesky(B))` now computes the generalized eigenvalues
    (`eigen`: and eigenvectors) of `A` and `B` via Cholesky decomposition
    for positive definite `B`. Note: The second argument is the output of
    `cholesky`.
  * Format specifiers now support dynamic width and precision, e.g. `%*s`
    and `%*.*g`.
  * When stack traces are printed, the printed depth of types in function
  signatures will be limited
    to avoid overly verbose output.
  * The `@test_broken` macro (or `@test` with `broken=true`) now complains
    if the test expression returns a non-boolean value in the same way as
    a non-broken test.
  * When a call to `@test` fails or errors inside a function, a larger
    stacktrace is now printed such that the location of the  test within a
    `@testset` can be retrieved.
  * `code_native` and `@code_native` now default to intel syntax instead
    of AT&amp;T.
  * `@time_imports` now shows the timing of any module `__init__()`s that
    are run.
  * The `@pure` macro is now deprecated. Use `Base.@assume_effects :foldable` instead ([#48682]).
- Set Cmake version requirement to be at least 3.22
- Accommodate renaming dependencies in specfile.
- Disable jldownload by just running true
- Add fix-dependencies-checksums.patch
  * Fix checksum checks for suitesparse aarch64. Sources are fetched from the same source.
  * Fix checksum checks for libLLVM_jll
  * It's checking for the checksums and it is also trying to fetch them from the internet 
    and idk what's the point of having the full julia tarball.
- Fix build
  * use bundled suitesparse. comment out system suitesparse build requirement
  * comment out openblas development dependencies. use bundled openblas.
  * comment out lapack development dependencies. use bundled lapack.
  * move openblas build away from the actual make build.
    this ensures that it's installed properly because doing otherwise will
    skip the install of the dependencies. weird but it works.
- Update specfile for bundled LLVM
- Add missing build requirements for bundled llvm 15
- Fix aarch64 build. it needs to download a source that can just be copied which is
  SuiteSparse.v7.2.1+1.aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
- Use python3 instead of python. Python 2.x is EOL-ed. Addresses bsc#1219740
- Set suitesparse requirement to 7.2.1 and libcholmod to 5.x.x
- Add Obsoletes to obsolete older versions for julia and its subpackages.
- Enable only tier 1 architectures
- Add disable-doc-gen-in-makefile.patch
- Add disable-download-of-unicode-for-doc-gen.patch
- Add UnicodeData.txt
- Add julia-remove-libcholmod_cuda.patch
- Add julia.keyring
- Add julia-1.10.0-full.tar.gz.asc
- Update julia-hardcoded-libs.patch
- Update specfile and enable v3 CPU optimizations on x86_64 architecture
- Update to version 1.10.0:
* New language features
  - JuliaSyntax.jl is now used as the default parser, providing better diagnostics and faster
    parsing. Set environment variable `JULIA_USE_FLISP_PARSER` to `1` to switch back to the old
    parser if necessary (and if you find this necessary, please file an issue).

    is linked to LLVM 15 or later versions.

  - New option `--gcthreads` to set how many threads will be used by the garbage collector.
    The default is `N/2` where `N` is the number of worker threads (`--threads`) used by Julia.
