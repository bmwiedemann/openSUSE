Thu Jun  6 12:34:28 UTC 2019 - simmphonie@opensuse.org

- spec-file changes
  + add jumbo scripts and remove "env" from shebang
  + remove patches. In upstream already:
    + john-1.7.9-powerpc_BE_need_rhash_u32_swap_copy.patch
    + ppc64le.patch
    + reproducible.patch
  + use configure to find dependenices and CPU architecture
    + openCL support
    + multicore support with fork option
    + require CPU with AVX support at least
  + root rights are no longer required

- update to 1.9.0
  + Increased the interleaving for bcrypt on x86-64 from 2x to 3x for a major
    speedup on CPUs without SMT.  Unfortunately, this sometimes results in a minor
    performance regression when running multiple threads on CPUs with SMT.
  + Recognize the $2b$ bcrypt prefix.
  + In the generic crypt(3) format, detect descrypt with valid vs. invalid salts
    as separate id's for our heuristics on supported hash types.
  + Introduced a number of optimizations for faster handling of large password
    hash files, including loading, cracking, and "--show".  Some of these use more
    memory than before, yet in a more efficient manner.
  + Benchmark using all-different candidate passwords of length 7 by default.
  + Dropped undocumented special handling of "Mc" in 'c' and 'C' rule commands.
  + Dropped undocumented limitation of the 'M' and 'Q' rule commands where they
    would sometimes memorize/check only up to the current hash type's length limit
    yet this optimization wouldn't necessarily be transparent (e.g., if a later
    command would extract a substring from above the hash type's length limit and
    bring it to within the limit).
  + Implemented special-case handling of repeated rule commands '$', '^', '[',
    ']', '{', and '}', as well as faster handling of the 'D' command.
  + When built with "--fork" support, disallow session names with all-digit
    suffixes since these clash with those produced by "--fork".
  + Forward SIGTERM to --fork'ed children.
  + Set stdout to line buffered (rather than potentially fully buffered), except
    for "--stdout", "--show", and auxiliary programs such as "unshadow".
  + On Windows, restore normal processing of Ctrl-C in case our parent (such as
    Johnny the GUI) had disabled it.
  + Added linux-x86*-avx512 and linux-x86*-avx2 make targets, which use
    respectively AVX-512 and AVX2 for bitslice DES.
  + Added linux-mic make target for Intel MIC (first generation Xeon Phi, aka
    Knights Corner), which uses its 512-bit SIMD intrinsics for bitslice DES.
    (For second generation Xeon Phi, aka Knights Landing, use linux-x86-64-avx512.)
  + Added linux-arm64le, linux-arm32le-neon, and linux-arm32le make targets.
    (The first two of these make use of ASIMD or NEON for bitslice DES.)
  + Added linux-sparc64 make target.
  + Made a minor optimization to MMX and SSE2 assembly code for LM hash.
  + Dropped Ultrix and SCO support.
  + Don't probe for alternate config file names (like john.ini when on Unix).
  + "DokuWiki" external mode sample has been added to the default john.conf.
  + Fixed operator precedence in the external mode compiler to be the same as C.
  + Fixed an out of bounds write bug in the external mode virtual machine.
  + Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.7.4 in the wordlist rules engine, where
    some sequences of rule commands could overflow a word buffer.
  + Fixed a bug where unaligned access SSE/AVX instructions would unnecessarily
    be generated by GCC 4.6+ in the bitslice DES code in non-OpenMP builds.
  + Fixed a bug where "Warning: no OpenMP support for this hash type" could be
    printed in "--stdout" mode.
  + Made assorted other bugfixes, portability and documentation enhancements.

- version 1.7.9.8
  + Revised the incremental mode to let the current character counts grow for
    each character position independently, with the aim to improve efficiency in
    terms of successful guesses per candidate passwords tested.
  + Revised the pre-defined incremental modes, as well as external mode filters
    that are used to generate .chr files.
  + Added makechr, a script to (re-)generate .chr files.
  + Enhanced the status reporting to include four distinct speed metrics (g/s,
    p/s, c/s, and C/s).
  + Added the "--fork=N" and "--node=MIN[-MAX]/TOTAL" options for trivial
    parallel and distributed processing.
  + In the external mode compiler, treat character literals as unsigned.
  + Renamed many of the formats.
  + Updated the documentation.
  + Relaxed the license for many source files to cut-down BSD.
  + Relaxed the license for John the Ripper as a whole from GPLv2 (exact version)
    to GPLv2 or newer with optional OpenSSL and unRAR exceptions.
  + Assorted other changes have been made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 13 06:07:17 UTC 2012 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.7.9:
  + Added optional parallelization of the MD5-based crypt(3) code with OpenMP.
  + Added optional parallelization of the bitslice DES code with OpenMP.
  + Replaced the bitslice DES key setup algorithm with a faster one, which
    significantly improves performance at LM hashes, as well as at DES-based
    crypt(3) hashes when there's just one salt (or very few salts).
  + Optimized the DES S-box x86-64 (16-register SSE2) assembly code.
  + Added support for 10-character DES-based tripcodes (not optimized yet).
  + Added support for the "$2y$" prefix of bcrypt hashes.
  + Added two more hash table sizes (16M and 128M entries) for faster processing
    of very large numbers of hashes per salt (over 1M).
  + Added two pre-defined external mode variables: "abort" and "status", which
    let an external mode request the current cracking session to be aborted or the
    status line to be displayed, respectively.
  + Made some minor optimizations to external mode function calls and virtual
    machine implementation.
  + The "--make-charset" option now uses floating-point rather than 64-bit
    integer operations, which allows for larger CHARSET_* settings in params.h.
  + Added runtime detection of Intel AVX and AMD XOP instruction set extensions,
    with optional fallback to an alternate program binary.
  + Added relbench, a Perl script to compare two "john --test" benchmark runs,
    such as for different machines, "make" targets, C compilers, optimization
    options, or/and versions of John the Ripper.
  + Additional public lists of "top N passwords" have been merged into the
    bundled common passwords list, and some insufficiently common passwords were
    removed from the list.
  + Many minor enhancements and a few bug fixes were made.
- updated jumbo patch to 1.7.9-jumbo-6

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  9 16:39:40 UTC 2010 - lars@linux-schulserver.de

- update to 1.7.6:
  + Generic crypt(3) support (enabled with "--format=crypt") has been 
    added for auditing password hash types supported by the system but 
    not yet supported by John's own optimized cryptographic routines 
    (such as "SHA-crypt" and SunMD5).
  + Optional parallelization of the above has been implemented by 
    means of OpenMP along with glibc's crypt_r(3)
  + Optional parallelization of John's own optimized code for the 
    OpenBSD-style Blowfish-based crypt(3) (bcrypt) hashes with OpenMP 
    has been added
  + A more suitable version of 32-bit x86 assembly code for Blowfish 
    is now chosen on Core i7 and similar CPUs (in 32 bit mode)
  + More optimal DES S-box expressions for PowerPC with AltiVec
  + The bitslice DES C source code has been reworked to allow for 
    the use of arbitrary SIMD intrinsics, which was previously only 
    implemented for AltiVec as a special case
  + Support for SSE2 and MMX intrinsics with bitslice DES (as an 
    alternative to the supplied assembly code) has been added 
    (currently only enabled for SSE2 on x86-64)
  + Support for mixed-type longer virtual vectors (such as SSE2+MMX, 
    SSE2+ALU, AltiVec+ALU, and other combinations) with bitslice 
    DES has been added
  + The loader will now detect password hashes specified on a line
    on their own, not only as part of an /etc/passwd or PWDUMP 
    format file
  + When run in "--stdin" mode and reading candidate passwords from 
    a terminal (to be typed by the user), John will no longer mess 
    with the terminal settings
  + John will now restore terminal settings not only on normal 
    termination or interrupt, but also when forcibly interrupted 
    with two Ctrl-C keypresses 
  + A new numeric variable has been added to the word mangling rules 
    engine: "p" for position of the character last found with the 
    "/" or "%" commands 
  + Support for the use of "--format" along with "--show" or 
    "--make-charset" has been added
  + The choice of .rec and .log filenames for custom session names 
    has been made more intuitive
  + Support for "\r" (character lists with repeats) and "\p0" 
    (reference to the immediately preceding character list/range) 
    has been added to the word mangling rules preprocessor
  + The undefined and undocumented behavior of some subtle word 
    mangling rules preprocessor constructs has been changed to 
    arguably be more sensible

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 11 21:53:39 CET 2010 - lrupp@suse.de

- update to 1.7.4.2:
  + Major performance improvements
  + John will now tend to use more memory to achieve better speed
  + Some previously missed common website passwords found on public 
    lists of "top N passwords" have been added to the bundled common 
    passwords list.
  + Support for back-references and "parallel" ranges has been 
    added to the word mangling rules preprocessor.
  + The notion of numeric variables has been introduced into the 
    rules engine.  
  + New rule commands have been added
  + New rule reject flags have been added
  + The default rulesets for "single crack" and wordlist modes have 
    been revised to make use of the new features, for speed, to 
    produce fewer duplicates, and to attempt additional kinds of 
    candidate passwords.
  + The default for the Idle setting has been changed from N to Y.
