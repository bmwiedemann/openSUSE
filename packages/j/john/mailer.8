.TH mailer "8" "October 2013" "Lars Vogdt" "John"
.SH NAME
Mailer \- notify users about crackable passwords

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mailer <password-file>
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mailer
is a script to send mail to all users whose passwords got cracked.
This is not always a good idea, though, since lots of people do not
check their e-mail or ignore such messages, and the messages can be a
hint for crackers.

You should probably deploy proactive password strength checking, such as
with passwdqc, before you ask users to change their passwords - whether
using this script or otherwise.  And you should edit the message inside
the script before possibly using it.
