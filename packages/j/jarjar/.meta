  <title>Repackage Java libraries</title>
  <description>Jar Jar Links is a utility that makes it easy to repackage Java
libraries and embed them into your own distribution. This is useful for
two reasons: You can easily ship a single jar file with no external
dependencies. You can avoid problems where your library depends on a
specific version of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies
of another library.</description>
