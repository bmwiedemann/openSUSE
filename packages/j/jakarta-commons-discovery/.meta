  <title>Jakarta Commons Discovery</title>
  <description>The Discovery component is about discovering, or finding,
implementations for pluggable interfaces.  Pluggable interfaces are
specified with the intent that multiple implementations are, or will
be, available to provide the service described by the interface. 
Discovery provides facilities for finding and instantiating classes and
for lifecycle management of singleton (factory) classes.</description>
