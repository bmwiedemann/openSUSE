  <title>Java manipulation of XML</title>
  <description>JDOM is a Java-oriented object model which models XML documents.
It provides a Java-centric means of generating and manipulating
XML documents. While JDOM inter-operates well with existing
standards such as the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document
Object Model (DOM), it is not an abstraction layer or
enhancement to those APIs. Rather, it provides a means of
reading and writing XML data.
