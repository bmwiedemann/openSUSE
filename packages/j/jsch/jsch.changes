Sat Jun  3 11:03:46 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Migrate from com.jcraft:jsch to com.github.mwiede:jsch fork
  (bsc#1211955)
  * Alias to the old artifact since the new one is drop-in
    replacement
  * Keep the old OSGi bundle symbolic name to avoid extensive
    patching of eclipse stack
- Upgrade to version 0.2.9
  * Changes of 0.2.9
    + various improvements, #295
      ~ #293 allow UserAuthNone to be extended.
      ~ Make JGSS module optional.
      ~ Tweak OSGi bundle manifest:
      ~ Avoid self-import.
      ~ Mark JGSS as optional.
      ~ Loosen import versions of dependencies.
      ~ Correctly adhere to the Multi-release JAR spec by ensuring
        all public classes under versioned directories preside over
        classes present in the top-level directory.
      ~ Eliminate stray System.err.println() calls.
      ~ Change PageantConnector to use JNA's built-in support for
        User32.SendMessage().
    + Improve error handling in InputStream.close() for SFTP
      channels, #331
  * Changes of 0.2.8
    + activate sourcecode formatting, #247
    + build improvements, #279
    + #287 add algorithm type information to algorithm negotiation
      logs, #290
    + wrap NoClassDefFoundError's for invalid private keys, #289 and
      #290
  * Changes of 0.2.7
    + #265 change buffer_margin computation to be dynamic based upon
      the MAC to allow connections that advertise small maximum
      packet sizes.
    + #266 fix PuTTY key parsing to work with unix line endings.
    + Add support for ECDSA and EdDSA type PuTTY keys.
    + #71 add support for PuTTY version 3 format keys.
      ~ Encrypted PuTTY version 3 format keys requires Bouncy
        Castle (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Eliminate KeyPairDeferred and instead change handling of
      OpenSSH V1 type keys to be more like other KeyPair types.
    + Be more vigilant about clearing private key data.
    + Improve PKCS8 key handling and add support for PKCS5 2.1
      encryption.
    + Add support for ECDSA type PKCS8 keys.
    + Add support for SCrypt type KDF for PKCS8 keys.
      ~ PKCS8 keys using SCrypt requires Bouncy Castle
        (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Add support for EdDSA type PKCS8 keys.
      ~ EdDSA type PKCS8 keys requires Bouncy Castle
        (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Attempt to authenticate using other signature algorithms
      supported by the same public key.
      ~ Allow this behavior to be disabled via
        try_additional_pubkey_algorithms config option.
        ° Some servers incorrectly respond with
          SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK to an initial auth query that they
          don't actually support for RSA keys.
    + Add a new config option enable_pubkey_auth_query to allow
      skipping auth queries and proceed directly to attempting
      full SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST's.
    + Add a new config option enable_auth_none to control whether
      an initial auth request for the method none is sent to detect
      all supported auth methods available on the server.
  * Changes of 0.2.6
    + Include host alias instead of the real host in messages and
      exceptions, #257
    + Fix missing keySize set when loading V1 RSA keys, #258
    + Enhancement to present KeyPair.getKeyTypeString() method, #259
  * Changes of 0.2.5

    + misc improvements, #152
    + Fixing Issue #131, #134
    + Update link to bcrypt, #157
  * Changes of 0.2.1
    + Allow to set a Logger per JSch-instance rather than a VM-wide
      one, #128
    + Preliminary changes prior to Javadoc work, #126
    + remove check to allow setting any filename encoding with any
      server version #137, #142
  * Changes of 0.2.0
    + Disable RSA/SHA1 signature algorithm by default #75
    + Add basic Logger implementations that can be optionally
      utilized with JSch.setLogger():
      ~ JulLogger, using java.util.logging.Logger
      ~ JplLogger, using Java 9's JEP 264
      ~ Log4j2Logger, using Apache Log4j 2
      ~ Slf4jLogger, using SLF4J
    + Fix client version to be compliant with RFC 4253 section 4.2
      by not including minus sign characters #115
    + Add java.util.zip based compression implementation #114
      ~ This is based upon the CompressionJUZ implementation posted
        to the JSch-users mailing list in 2012 by the original JSch
        author
      ~ The existing JZlib implementation remains the default to
        maintain strict RFC 4253 section 6.2 compliance
        ° To use the new implementation globally, execute
          JSch.setConfig("zlib@openssh.com",
          "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression") +
          JSch.setConfig("zlib", "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression")
        ° To use the new implementation per session, execute
          session.setConfig("zlib@openssh.com",
          "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression")
          + session.setConfig("zlib",
          "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression")

    + Address #83 by sending CR LF at the end of the identification
      string
    + Fix earlier change for #76 that failed to correctly make the
      "Host" keyword case-insensitive
    + Fix PageantConnector struct class visibility #86
  * Changes of 0.1.68
    + Added support for the rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se algorithm
    + Added support for the hmac-ripemd160,
      hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com and hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com
      algorithms using Bouncy Castle
    + Added support for various algorithms from RFC 4253 and
      RFC 4344 using Bouncy Castle
      ~ cast128-cbc
      ~ cast128-ctr
      ~ twofish-cbc
      ~ twofish128-cbc
      ~ twofish128-ctr
      ~ twofish192-cbc
      ~ twofish192-ctr
      ~ twofish256-cbc
      ~ twofish256-ctr
    + Added support for the seed-cbc@ssh.com algorithm using Bouncy
      Castle
  * Changes of 0.1.67
    + Added support for the blowfish-ctr algorithm from RFC 4344
    + Fix bug where ext-info-c was incorrectly advertised during
      rekeying
      ~ According to RFC 8308 section 2.1, ext-info-c should only
        advertised during the first key exchange
    + Address #77 by attempting to add compatibility with older
      Bouncy Castle releases
  * Changes of 0.1.66
    + Added support for RFC 8308 extension negotiation and
      server-sig-algs extension
      ~ This support is enabled by default, but can be controlled
        via the enable_server_sig_algs config option (or
        jsch.enable_server_sig_algs system property)
      ~ When enabled and a server-sig-algs message is received from
        the server, the algorithms included by the server and also
        present in the PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes config option will be
        attempted first when using publickey authentication
      ~ Additionally if the server is detected as OpenSSH version
        7.4, the rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 algorithms will be
        added to the received server-sig-algs as a workaround for
        OpenSSH bug 2680
    + Added support for various algorithms supported by Tectia
      (ssh.com):
      ~ diffie-hellman-group14-sha224@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group14-sha256@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group15-sha256@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group15-sha384@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group16-sha384@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group16-sha512@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group18-sha512@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha224@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha384@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha512@ssh.com
      ~ hmac-sha224@ssh.com
      ~ hmac-sha256@ssh.com
      ~ hmac-sha256-2@ssh.com
      ~ hmac-sha384@ssh.com
      ~ hmac-sha512@ssh.com
      ~ ssh-rsa-sha224@ssh.com
      ~ ssh-rsa-sha256@ssh.com
      ~ ssh-rsa-sha384@ssh.com
      ~ ssh-rsa-sha512@ssh.com
    + Added support for SHA224 to FingerprintHash
    + Fixing #52
    + Deprecate void setFilenameEncoding(String encoding) in favor
      of void setFilenameEncoding(Charset encoding) in ChannelSftp
    + Added support for rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-rsa2-512 algorithms to
      ChannelAgentForwarding
    + Address #65 by adding ssh-agent support derived from
      jsch-agent-proxy
      ~ See examples/JSchWithAgentProxy.java for simple example
      ~ ssh-agent support requires either Java 16's JEP 380 or the
        addition of junixsocket to classpath
      ~ Pageant support is untested and requires the addition of JNA
        to classpath
    + Added support for the following algorithms with older Java
      releases by using Bouncy Castle:
      ~ ssh-ed25519
      ~ ssh-ed448
      ~ curve25519-sha256
      ~ curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
      ~ curve448-sha512
      ~ chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
  * Changes of 0.1.65
    + Added system properties to allow manipulation of various
      crypto algorithms used by default
    + Integrated JZlib, allowing use of zlib@openssh.com and zlib
      compressions without the need to provide the JZlib jar-file
    + Modularized the jar-file for use with Java 9 or newer
    + Added runtime controls for the min/max/preferred sizes used
      for diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 and
      diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    + Renamed PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes config to
      PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms to match recent changes in OpenSSH
      (PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes is still accepted for backward
      compatibility)
    + Reduced number of algorithms that are runtime checked by
      default via CheckCiphers, CheckMacs, CheckKExes and
      CheckSignatures to improve runtime performance
  * Changes of 0.1.64
    + #55 bug fix
  * Changes of 0.1.63
    + fix for #42

      ssh-ed448, curve448-sha512, diffie-hellman-group15-sha512
      and diffie-hellman-group17-sha512.
      This makes use of the new EdDSA feature added in Java 15's
      JEP 339. #17
    + added integration test for public key authentication #19
  * Changes of 0.1.60
