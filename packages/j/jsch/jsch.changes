- Upgrade to version 0.2.15, which includes fix for SSH protocol
  vulnerability (bsc#1218134, CVE-2023-48795)
  * Changes in 0.2.15:
    + Address CVE-2023-48795 by adding support for new strict key
      exchange extension
    + Add support for ext-info-in-auth@openssh.com extension
    + Introduce two new config options to control usage of the new
      strict key exchange extension:
      ~ enable_strict_kex (set to yes by default)
      ~ require_strict_kex (set to no by default)
      ~ If either option (or both) is enabled, then JSch will
        attempt to use the new strict key exchange extension.
      ~ If the require_strict_kex option is enabled and JSch detects
        the server does not support it, then JSch will terminate the
        connection and throw an exception.
      ~ If the require_strict_kex option is not enabled and JSch
        detects the server does not support it, then JSch will
        fallback and proceed with the connection without using the
        new extension.
    + This gives users the ability to enable a strong security
      posture if needed and avoid proceeding with connections to
      potentially insecure servers.
  * Changes in 0.2.14:
    + #450 use Socket.connect() with a timeout that has been
      supported since Java 1.4 instead of using old method of
      creating a separate thread and joining to that thread with
      timeout
  * Changes in 0.2.13:
    + #411 Add flush operation from Fix added is/jsch#39,
      with new config option to allow disabling in case it causes
      regressions.
    + #403 add a warning when Channel.getInputStream() or
      Channel.getExtInputStream() is called after Channel.connect().
  * Changes in 0.2.12:
    + Further refine previous fixes for windows line endings in PEM
      keys
    + #392 replace call to BigInteger.intValueExact to remain
      compatible with android api 30
    + Introduce JSchSessionDisconnectException to allow the
      reasonCode to be retrieved without String parsing
    + Introduce specific JSchException for HostKey related failures
  * Changes in 0.2.11:
    + update dependencies changes
    + #369 fix multi-line PEM key parsing to work with windows line
      endings due to regression from previous fix for #362.
  * Changes in 0.2.10:
    + Fix new Java 21 compiler warning: possible 'this' escape
      before subclass is fully initialized
    + Tweak OSGi bundle manifest to allow Log4j 3
    + #362 fix PEM key parsing to work with windows line endings
    + #361 guard against UIKeyboardInteractive implementations that
      include NULL elements in the String[] returned from
      promptKeyboardInteractive()
    + Add a default implmentation of the deprecated decrypt() method
      to the Identity interface that throws an
      UnsupportedOperationException

- Migrate from com.jcraft:jsch to com.github.mwiede:jsch fork
  (bsc#1211955)
  * Alias to the old artifact since the new one is drop-in
    replacement
  * Keep the old OSGi bundle symbolic name to avoid extensive
    patching of eclipse stack
- Upgrade to version 0.2.9

        classes present in the top-level directory.
      ~ Eliminate stray System.err.println() calls.
      ~ Change PageantConnector to use JNA's built-in support for
        User32.SendMessage().

      packet sizes.
    + #266 fix PuTTY key parsing to work with unix line endings.
    + Add support for ECDSA and EdDSA type PuTTY keys.
    + #71 add support for PuTTY version 3 format keys.
      ~ Encrypted PuTTY version 3 format keys requires Bouncy
        Castle (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Eliminate KeyPairDeferred and instead change handling of
      OpenSSH V1 type keys to be more like other KeyPair types.
    + Be more vigilant about clearing private key data.

      encryption.
    + Add support for ECDSA type PKCS8 keys.
    + Add support for SCrypt type KDF for PKCS8 keys.
      ~ PKCS8 keys using SCrypt requires Bouncy Castle
        (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Add support for EdDSA type PKCS8 keys.
      ~ EdDSA type PKCS8 keys requires Bouncy Castle
        (bcprov-jdk18on).
    + Attempt to authenticate using other signature algorithms
      supported by the same public key.
      ~ Allow this behavior to be disabled via
        try_additional_pubkey_algorithms config option.
        ° Some servers incorrectly respond with
          SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK to an initial auth query that they
          don't actually support for RSA keys.
    + Add a new config option enable_pubkey_auth_query to allow
      skipping auth queries and proceed directly to attempting
      full SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST's.
    + Add a new config option enable_auth_none to control whether
      an initial auth request for the method none is sent to detect
      all supported auth methods available on the server.

    + Include host alias instead of the real host in messages and
      exceptions, #257
    + Fix missing keySize set when loading V1 RSA keys, #258

    + remove check to allow setting any filename encoding with any
      server version #137, #142
  * Changes of 0.2.0
    + Disable RSA/SHA1 signature algorithm by default #75
    + Add basic Logger implementations that can be optionally
      utilized with JSch.setLogger():
      ~ JulLogger, using java.util.logging.Logger
      ~ JplLogger, using Java 9's JEP 264
      ~ Log4j2Logger, using Apache Log4j 2
      ~ Slf4jLogger, using SLF4J
    + Fix client version to be compliant with RFC 4253 section 4.2
      by not including minus sign characters #115
    + Add java.util.zip based compression implementation #114
      ~ This is based upon the CompressionJUZ implementation posted
        to the JSch-users mailing list in 2012 by the original JSch
        author
      ~ The existing JZlib implementation remains the default to
        maintain strict RFC 4253 section 6.2 compliance
        ° To use the new implementation globally, execute
          JSch.setConfig("zlib@openssh.com",
          "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression") +
          JSch.setConfig("zlib", "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression")
        ° To use the new implementation per session, execute
          session.setConfig("zlib@openssh.com",
          "com.jcraft.jsch.juz.Compression")

      ~ According to RFC 8308 section 2.1, ext-info-c should only
        advertised during the first key exchange
    + Address #77 by attempting to add compatibility with older
      Bouncy Castle releases
  * Changes of 0.1.66
    + Added support for RFC 8308 extension negotiation and
      server-sig-algs extension
      ~ This support is enabled by default, but can be controlled
        via the enable_server_sig_algs config option (or
        jsch.enable_server_sig_algs system property)
      ~ When enabled and a server-sig-algs message is received from
        the server, the algorithms included by the server and also
        present in the PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes config option will be
        attempted first when using publickey authentication
      ~ Additionally if the server is detected as OpenSSH version
        7.4, the rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 algorithms will be
        added to the received server-sig-algs as a workaround for
        OpenSSH bug 2680
    + Added support for various algorithms supported by Tectia
      (ssh.com):
      ~ diffie-hellman-group14-sha224@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group14-sha256@ssh.com
      ~ diffie-hellman-group15-sha256@ssh.com

    + Address #65 by adding ssh-agent support derived from
      jsch-agent-proxy
      ~ See examples/JSchWithAgentProxy.java for simple example
      ~ ssh-agent support requires either Java 16's JEP 380 or the
        addition of junixsocket to classpath
      ~ Pageant support is untested and requires the addition of JNA
        to classpath
    + Added support for the following algorithms with older Java
      releases by using Bouncy Castle:
      ~ ssh-ed25519
      ~ ssh-ed448
      ~ curve25519-sha256
      ~ curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

    + Modularized the jar-file for use with Java 9 or newer
    + Added runtime controls for the min/max/preferred sizes used
      for diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 and
      diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    + Renamed PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes config to
      PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms to match recent changes in OpenSSH
      (PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes is still accepted for backward
      compatibility)
    + Reduced number of algorithms that are runtime checked by
      default via CheckCiphers, CheckMacs, CheckKExes and
      CheckSignatures to improve runtime performance
