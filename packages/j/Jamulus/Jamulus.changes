- Update to version 3.4.5
  The upstream maintainer announced that he will no longer publish source
  tarballs to SF.net, so fetched the tarball from github directly.
  Changes included:

  * added a scroll bar to the mixer board to support large numbers of
    mixer faders (a thank you to doloopuntil for his help)
  * changed the maximum number of clients supported by the server from 20 to 50
  * Windows installer now contains a 32 and 64 bit version of Jamulus (the version to
    be installed is selected automatically according to the detected operating system)
  * bug fix: server list ping times may not be accurate and client list may not be retrieved
