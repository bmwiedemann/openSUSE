    <comment>- Rename source tarball
- Update to version 3.4.5
  The upstream maintainer announced that he will no longer publish source
  tarballs to SF.net, so fetched the tarball from github directly.
  Changes included:
  * audio fade-in at the server if a new client connects
  * added a scroll bar to the mixer board to support large numbers of
    mixer faders (a thank you to doloopuntil for his help)
  * changed the maximum number of clients supported by the server from 20 to 50
  * Windows installer now contains a 32 and 64 bit version of Jamulus (the version to
    be installed is selected automatically according to the detected operating system)
  * bug fix: server list ping times may not be accurate and client list may not be retrieved

 * The term &quot;Central server&quot; has been replaced with &quot;Directory 
   server&quot; (#1407, #1715, #1629).
   Note that the program will still accept the --centralserver 
   option for backward
   compatibility with existing system startup scripts, but its usage 
   is deprecated.
   (contributed by @pljones, @softins)
   
 * Mac: Generate build with Qt 5.15.2 for better compatibility with 
   Big Sur (#1687, #1768).
   We still build a legacy version with Qt 5.9.9 to support older 
   versions of macOS:
    * Users of 10.13 (High sierra) or newer should use the standard 
      build with Qt 5.15.2
    * Users of Yosemite, El Capitan or Sierra should use the legacy 
      build with Qt 5.9.9
      (contributed by @softins)
   
 * GUI: Settings window has been reorganized into tabs (#1415, 
   #1554, #1542, #1588):
    * User Profile window has been integrated into the settings 
      window.
    * Input Pan has been moved to the newly created Advanced tab 
      and removed from main window.
      (contributed by @dcorson-ticino-com, @pljones)
   
 * GUI: Moved the Ping and Delay stats from the Settings window to 
   the main window (#1762):
   This was partly to work around a Mac issue with updates to the 
   settings window (#1643)
   and is actually an improvement anyway, as the settings window 
   does not need to remain open.
   (contributed by @dcorson-ticino-com and @softins)
   
 * GUI: Added &quot;About Qt&quot; to the help menu to display version of Qt 
   (#1685, #1692).
   (contributed by @softins)

 * Network: Support for DSCP Quality of Service flags has been added 
   (#1310).
   This is supposed to lead to improved network performance.
   It is enabled by default.
   On Windows, this requires additional configuration in order to 
   work.
   Please see the Tips &amp; Tricks page on the website for a setup 
   guide for Windows.

 * Client: Automatic channel fader adjustment simplifies mixer setup 
   by using the channel level meters (#1071).
   (contributed by @JohannesBrx)

   (contributed by @JohannesBrx)

   (contributed by @djfun)
   
 * Server: Support for Delay Panning has been added (#332, #567, 
   #1151, #1417, #1744):
   This feature can be enabled on servers using the new --delaypan 
   option.
   Enabling this feature will slightly increase server CPU usage.
   It can create a much more realistic spatial sound impression for 
   clients
   that are set to Stereo or Mono-in/Stereo-out mode.
   (contributed by @DetlefHennings, @Hk1020, @softins, @henkdegroot)
   
 * Server: Multi-threading performance has been improved (#960).
   (contributed by @menzels, @softins)
   
 * Server: Half-connected clients will no longer receive audio 
   (#1243, #1589):
   Note: This breaks compatibility with client versions before 3.3.0 
   (Feb 2013).
   If you update your server, ensure that all clients use 3.3.0 or 
   later as well.
   (contributed by @softins)
   
 * Server: HTML status file is now emptied on exit (#1423, #1427).
   (contributed by @hoffie, @drummer1154)
   
 * Server: An explicit bind address can now be specified (#141, 
   #1561).
   This can be done by the new --serverbindip option.
   (contributed by @buv)
   
 * Recorder: Compatibility with third-party tools such as Audacity 
   has been improved (#1384, #1424, #1437).

   (#1163, #1289, #1463).

   card or the numbers of channels changed (#1347).
   (contributed by @ann0see)

   non-working device was selected (#872).

   improved (#1536).
   (contributed by @npostavs)

    - Any Genre 3 has been added.
    - Choral/Barbershop has been added.
    - Classical/Folk/Choral has been renamed to Classical/Folk.
  * Central server addresses have been moved to the jamulus.io 
    domain (#919).
    The fischvolk.de addresses are deprecated.
  * GUI: If a name is provided using --clientname, that name is 
    shown first in the window title, to avoid clipping in the 
    Windows task bar (#789).
  * GUI: Translations have been updated:
    - Dutch, by @jerogee (#1110)
    - French, by @trebmuh &amp; @jujudusud (#1199 &amp; #1113)
    - German, by @rolamos (#1097)

  * Windows installer has been improved (#792, #841).
    Note: If you are using ASIO4ALL, we strongly suggest that
    you take a screenshot of your ASIO4ALL settings before upgrading.
    The installer will try its best to migrate your settings, but
    it may fail to do so when using custom installation paths.
  * Windows installer interface now supports English, Dutch, French,
    German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

      to a suffix such as dev, beta or rc.

    part of the release (#1100).
    The packages are compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 or later.

  * Bug fix: A suspected memory leak has been solved by removing 
    usage of ConsoleWriterFactory (#926).

    mapping in Jamulus again (#796).
    This was done to solve a bug with ASIO4ALL introduced in the
    last version.
  * Bug fix: Fader levels, mute and solo state are now restored 
    properly when reconnecting to a restarted server (#955, #1010).

    have been fixed (#1073).

    translations (#1165).

    Dialog&quot; setting from the server GUI and changed the
