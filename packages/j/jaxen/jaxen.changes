- Upgrade to version 2.0.0
  * Changes:
    + Despite the major version bump, this should be a drop in
      replacement for almost every project, The two major possible
      incompatibilities are:
      ° The minimum supported Java version is now 1.5, up from 1.4
        in 1.2.0 and 1.3 in 1.1.6.
      ° dom4j, XOM, and JDOM are now optional dependencies so if a
        project was depending on them to be loaded transitively it
        will need to add explicit dependencies to build.
    + On the plus side, this makes classpaths much smaller and less
      complex, and will shut up a lot of noise from static analysis
      tools.
    + In addition the Jaxen core code is also a little smaller and
      has fixed a few minor bugs in XPath evaluation, mostly weird
      cases found by fuzzing that are unlikely to arise in practice.
