- Update to version 1.32.1:
  * Report line and column when using janet_dobytes
  * Add :unless loop modifier
  * Allow calling reverse on generators.
  * Improve performance of a number of core functions including partition, mean, keys, values, pairs, interleave.
  * Add lengthable?
  * Add os/sigaction
  * Change every? and any? to behave like the functional versions of the and and or macros.
  * Fix bug with garbage collecting threaded abstract types.
  * Add :signal to the sandbox function to allow intercepting signals.
  * Fix return value from C function janet_dobytes when called on Janet functions that yield to event loop.
  * Change C API for event loop interaction - get rid of JanetListener and instead use janet_async_start and janet_async_end.
  * Rework event loop to make fewer system calls on kqueue and epoll.
  * Expose atomic refcount abstraction in janet.h
  * Add array/weak for weak references in arrays
  * Add support for weak tables via table/weak, table/weak-keys, and table/weak-values.
  * Fix compiler bug with using the result of (break x) expression in some contexts.
  * Rework internal event loop code to be better behaved on Windows

  * Report line and column when using `janet_dobytes`
  * Add `:unless` loop modifier
  * Allow calling `reverse` on generators.
  * Improve performance of a number of core functions including `partition`, `mean`, `keys`, `values`, `pairs`, `interleave`.
  * Add `lengthable?`
  * Add `os/sigaction`
  * Change `every?` and `any?` to behave like the functional versions of the `and` and `or` macros.
  * Fix bug with garbage collecting threaded abstract types.
  * Add `:signal` to the `sandbox` function to allow intercepting signals.

- Update to version 1.30.0:
  Changes in 1.30.0:
   - Change indexing of `array/remove` to start from -1 at the end instead of -2.
   - Add new string escape sequences `\\a`, `\\b`, `\\?`, and `\\'`.
   - Fix bug with marshalling channels
   - Add `div` for floored division
   - Make `div` and `mod` variadic
   - Support `bnot` for integer types.
   - Define `(mod x 0)` as `x`
   - Add `ffi/pointer-cfunction` to convert pointers to cfunctions
  Changes since 1.29.1:
   - Add support for passing booleans to PEGs for "always" and "never" matching.
   - Allow dictionary types for `take` and `drop`
   - Fix bug with closing channels while other fibers were waiting on them - `ev/take`, `ev/give`, and `ev/select`  will now return the correct (documented) value when another fiber closes the channel.
   - Add `ffi/calling-conventions` to show all available calling conventions for FFI.
   - Add `net/setsockopt`
   - Add `signal` argument to `os/proc-kill` to send signals besides `SIGKILL` on Posix.
   - Add `source` argument to `os/clock` to get different time sources.
   - Various combinator functions now are variadic like `map`
   - Add `file/lines` to iterate over lines in a file lazily.
   - Reorganize test suite to be sorted by module rather than pseudo-randomly.
   - Add `*task-id*`
   - Add `env` argument to `fiber/new`.
   - Add `JANET_NO_AMALG` flag to Makefile to properly incremental builds
   - Optimize bytecode compiler to generate fewer instructions and improve loops.
   - Fix bug with `ev/gather` and hung fibers.
   - Add `os/isatty`
   - Add `has-key?` and `has-value?`
   - Make imperative arithmetic macros variadic
   - `ev/connect` now yields to the event loop instead of blocking while waiting for an ACK.

- Fix errors, trim, and wrap description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 27 13:19:20 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.28.0:
  * Various bug fixes
  * Make nested short-fn's behave a bit more predictably (it is still not recommended to nest short-fns).
  * Add os/strftime for date formatting.
  * Fix ev/select on threaded channels sometimes live-locking.
  * Support the NO_COLOR environment variable to turn off VT100 color codes in repl (and in scripts).
  * See http://no-color.org/
  * Disallow using (splice x) in contexts where it doesn't make sense rather than silently coercing to x.
  * Instead, raise a compiler error.
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 sigals to :interrupt and :await
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 fiber statuses to :interrupted and :suspended.
  * Add ev/all-tasks to see all currently suspended fibers.
  * Add keep-syntax and keep-syntax! functions to make writing macros easier.
