- Update to version 1.35.0
  *  Add :only argument to import to allow for easier control over imported bindings.
  *  Add extra optional env argument to eval and eval-string.
  *  Allow naming function literals with a keyword. This allows better stacktraces for macros without
  *  accidentally adding new bindings.
  *  Add bundle/ module for managing packages within Janet. This should replace the jpm packaging
  *  format eventually and is much simpler and amenable to more complicated builds.
  *  Add macros ev/with-lock, ev/with-rlock, and ev/with-wlock for using mutexes and rwlocks.
  *  Add with-env
  *  Add *module-make-env*dynamic binding
  *  Add buffer/format-at
  *  Add long form command line options for readable CLI usage
  *  Fix bug with net/accept-loop that would sometimes miss connections.
  *  Build janet with Cosmopolitan Libc
  *  Add ffi/defbind-alias 
  *  Add LoongArch64 suppor
  *  Fix buffer push uint max

- Update to version 1.30.0:
  Changes in 1.30.0:
   - Change indexing of `array/remove` to start from -1 at the end instead of -2.
   - Add new string escape sequences `\\a`, `\\b`, `\\?`, and `\\'`.
   - Fix bug with marshalling channels
   - Add `div` for floored division
   - Make `div` and `mod` variadic
   - Support `bnot` for integer types.
   - Define `(mod x 0)` as `x`

  Changes since 1.29.1:
   - Add support for passing booleans to PEGs for "always" and "never" matching.
   - Allow dictionary types for `take` and `drop`
   - Fix bug with closing channels while other fibers were waiting on them - `ev/take`, `ev/give`, and `ev/select`  will now return the correct (documented) value when another fiber closes the channel.
   - Add `ffi/calling-conventions` to show all available calling conventions for FFI.
   - Add `net/setsockopt`
   - Add `signal` argument to `os/proc-kill` to send signals besides `SIGKILL` on Posix.

   - Various combinator functions now are variadic like `map`
   - Add `file/lines` to iterate over lines in a file lazily.
   - Reorganize test suite to be sorted by module rather than pseudo-randomly.
   - Add `*task-id*`
   - Add `env` argument to `fiber/new`.
   - Add `JANET_NO_AMALG` flag to Makefile to properly incremental builds
   - Optimize bytecode compiler to generate fewer instructions and improve loops.
   - Fix bug with `ev/gather` and hung fibers.
   - Add `os/isatty`
   - Add `has-key?` and `has-value?`
   - Make imperative arithmetic macros variadic
   - `ev/connect` now yields to the event loop instead of blocking while waiting for an ACK.

  * Add os/strftime for date formatting.
  * Fix ev/select on threaded channels sometimes live-locking.
  * Support the NO_COLOR environment variable to turn off VT100 color codes in repl (and in scripts).
  * See http://no-color.org/

  * Instead, raise a compiler error.
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 sigals to :interrupt and :await
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 fiber statuses to :interrupted and :suspended.
