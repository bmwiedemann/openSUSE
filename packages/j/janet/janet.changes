- Update to version 1.28.0:
  * Various bug fixes
  * Make nested short-fn's behave a bit more predictably (it is still not recommended to nest short-fns).
  * Add os/strftime for date formatting.
  * Fix ev/select on threaded channels sometimes live-locking.
  * Support the NO_COLOR environment variable to turn off VT100 color codes in repl (and in scripts).
  * See http://no-color.org/
  * Disallow using (splice x) in contexts where it doesn't make sense rather than silently coercing to x.
  * Instead, raise a compiler error.
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 sigals to :interrupt and :await
  * Change the names of :user8 and :user9 fiber statuses to :interrupted and :suspended.
  * Add ev/all-tasks to see all currently suspended fibers.
  * Add keep-syntax and keep-syntax! functions to make writing macros easier.
