- Upgrade to version 3.1.10
  * Fixed issue #205: Classpath: Class archive file naming: Removed
    the file name check for class file archives; previously: *.jar
    and *.zip
  * Fixed issue #201: A Stack overflow error: Catch
    StackOverflowError in all relevant API methods 8e.g. "cook()"
    and "guessParameterNames()") and convert it into a
    CompileException (bsc#1211923, CVE-2023-33546).
  * Fixed issue #204: Evaluate method is ambiguous: Changed method
    "evaluate(Object...)" back to "evaluate(Object[])", and added a
    method "evaluate()" for convenience.
  * Fixed issue #202: Gracefully degradation if loading system
    properties throws an SecurityException
  * Fixed issue #182: Incompatible return types, when there are
    multiple methods with different return type
  * Fixed issue #188: Some expressions are failing without explicit
    cast of null
  * C++-style comment before EOI caused an internal compiler error.
  * Fixed issue #195: "Redefinition of constructors and methods
    allowed".
  * AutoIndentWriter: flush() / close(): The "tabulatorBuffer" and
    the "lineBuffer" were flushed in the wrong order, leaving the
    tabulatorBuffer unflushed under some conditions.
  * Fixed issue #196: "First type argument in ReferenceType lose
    its type arguments".
  * Fixed issue #183: "Add Automatic-Module-Name to MANIFEST.MF".
- Upgrade to version 3.1.9
  * Merged pr #189 "Implement implicit conversions to Arrays with
    Annotations".
  * Reproduce issue #188 "Some expressions are failing without
    explicit cast of null".
  * Fixed issue #187 "Compilation of vars initialized in different
    if/else branches is failing".
  * Fixed issue #185 "InternalCompilerException while compiling
    variables initialized in while condition".
  * Added the "-benchmark" command line option.
  * Fixed issue #182 "Incompatible return types, when there are
    multiple methods with different return type".
  * Eliminated generation of empty StackMapTable attributes.
- Upgrade to version 3.1.8
  * Generation of the StackMapTable is finally correct! However,
    the default tar version is still 6.
  * Regression tests finally pass for target version 8!
  * Fixed an AccessControlException with JRE 7.
  * Fixed issue #172 "SimpleCompiler Variable Bug", and also for
    VOID return type. Added test cases for issue 172 "SimpleCompiler
    Variable Bug".
  * Added more test cases for the "ConstantValue" attribute.
  * Added fix and regression test case for issue #177
    "ClassFormatError when assigning integer to constant double".
    Added test cases.
  * Fixed issue #174: "Byte code is 350 times larger due to
    StackMapTable, JVM crashes when loading the class". Added test
    cases.
  * Implementing nested types didn't work (dollar signs in class
    name).
  * Added code for debugging the loading of .class file and source
    files.
  * Added fix and regression test case for issue #178 "Janino
    incorrectly thinks variables are uninitialized". Added
    regression test cases.
  * Issue #176: "String s = System.out.println();" throws an
    InternalCompilerException
  * Implemented a system property
    "org.codehaus.janino.CodeContext.suppressStackMapTable"
    (boolean).
  * Fixed Issue #168 "commons-compiler-jdk: Unable to load class".
  * Added JDISASM with scope "test" because some test cases now need
    JDISASM.
  * Fixed GITHUB PR #10: Replace if condition with literal if
    possible to simplify if statement
  * Allow variable declarators between the LV declaration and the IF
    statement iff none of the VDs modify the LV.
  * Added "-Xverify:all" to all run configuration to enforce the
    strictest bytecode verification possible.
  * Test case "JlsTest.test_9_7_1__Normal_Annotations2()" choked
    because of annotation-type element value (annotation type is
    described by an UTF8 CPE, not a CLASS CPE).
  * Fixed issue #167 "After a successful compilation, compiling
    identical (or similar) code fails with an assignment conversion
    error".
  * Moved the "getArrayIClass(...)" methods from "IClass" to
    "IClassLoader", and keep the array classes per-class-loader
    (which is important because arrays refer to java.lang.Object).
    Also added a test case.
  * Removed JUnit launch configurations for Java 12, 15 and 16,
    which are no longer supported.
- Upgrade to version 3.1.7
  * Merged PR #148 "Correct the logic to truncate Stack map in
    CodeContext.restoreLocalVariables".
  * Merged PR #163 "Add SUPER flag for package member types only
    (#163)".
  * Fixed issue #166 "Get generate method bytecode size".
  * Added a test case for issue #165.
  * Fixed issue #165 "Compilation failure when a class and package
    name match case insensitively".
  * Replaced "new (Byte|Short|Integer|Long|Float|Double|Character
    |Boolean)(...)" with "valueOf(...)".
  * Replaced types "Visitor.*Visitor" with "*Visitor".
  * Fixed issue #135 again; this time right.
  * Fixed Issue #155 "Enhanced FOR statement does not work with
    primitive variable".
  * Verified compatibility with Java 17.
  * Began to extend IClass and ClassFile for generics; specifically
    added IType and ITypeVariable. However generics are not yet
    supported; work in progress (although regression tested).
  * Implemented private interface methods (a Java 9 feature).
  * Further simplified the
    org.codehaus.commons.compiler.jdk.SimpleCompiler: It now uses a
    delegate o.c.c.c.j.Compiler, which saves a lot of duplicate
    code.
  * Major refactoring of org.codehaus.commons.compiler.jdk to get
    rid of duplicate code.
  * Fixed the error handling of the
    o.c.c.c.jdk.(Compiler|SimpleCompiler); added respective test
    cases.
  * Marking the SimpleCompiler as "cooked" was not reliable.
  * Static and default interface methods were still declared as "not
    implemented" on the home page, while they are already
    implemented! Updated the home page, added some test cases and
    fixed a minor bug.
  * Added a test for the "diamond operator".
  * Removed all "redundant type arguments", i.e. made use of the
    "diamond operator". This became possible because support was
    dropped for Java 6.
  * Also dropped support for "funny" intermediate Java versions 9
    and 10.
  * Dropped support for Java 6. Thus, Janino is now compiled against
    the JRE 7 runtime.

    change. (#150)
