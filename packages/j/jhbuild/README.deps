This package installs dependencies that are generally useful when using jhbuild
to build GNOME. Some of those dependencies would be built by jhbuild by default,
but it can be configured to skip them. This is the default configuration
proposed in sample.jhbuildrc.

If you build GNOME and the build fails because of a missing dependency while
jhbuild-recommended-deps is installed, please file a bug about this at
https://bugzilla.opensuse.org
