Wed May 20 06:09:56 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.2.1:
  * Fix apps module bug (issue #119)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 05:36:09 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.2.0:
  * Add config options icon_norm_alpha and icon_sel_alpha.
  * Support hooks. See jgmenu(1) for full details.
  * Support startup script. Run ~/.config/jgmenu/startup on initial launch.
    This feature enables optional syncing with others settings such as GTK3.
  * gtktheme: save last theme name in ~/.cache/jgmenu/.last-gtktheme
    This supports scripts for syncing gtktheme on startup.
  * obtheme: set menu_border=0 by default to avoid inheriting unwanted menu
    border thickness if openbox theme does not contain an entry for it.
  * configure: support --libexecdir= and --libdir= (issue #109)
  * configure: use the correct xfce4panel library.
  * xfce4-panel: remove dpkg-architecture and hardcoded debian paths from
    Makefile (issue #110).

  * Add options --no-append and --no-prepend to jgmenu-apps(1) module.
  * Whitespace-trim all comma separated fields when using the argv-buf library,
    which is used for parsing menu data and widgets. This allows CSV data to be
    indented or aligned without affecting the content.
  * Resolve tilde in --csv-file value (issue #113).
  * Add config option csv_no_duplicates to prevent applications from showing
    in multiple directories. Only supported by jgmenu-apps(1) module.
  * Respect that % can be escaped using %%, when removing field codes
    (e.g. %U and %f) from .desktop file Exec= strings (issue #68).
    Supported by jgmenu-apps(1) and jgmenu-lx(1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 20 08:18:18 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0.1:
  * Issue #108. Show menu on correct monitor in IPC mode (position_mode=ipc)
    Before this fix, the menu would always appear on the monitor from which
    it was first launched.
  * Fix segfault bug in jgmenu-apps on OpenBSD.
  * Update lithium theme to reflect introduction of apps module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 13 12:14:54 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 4.0:
  * Add apps module - a replacement for pmenu and the default menu
    generator from v4.0 (hence major bump)
  * Move pmenu and lx modules to contrib/ to make maintenance and
    packaging easier.
  * jgmenu.c: hide 'last selection border' (issue #103).
  * Update man pages and usage() to prefer `jgmenu_run init` over
    `jgmenu init`
  * Add banned.h to make audits easier
  * Add scripts/pbuild to simplify building deb packages with pbuilder.
  * Add configure script in order to (a) make contrib/ packages easier
    to manange; and (b) remove dependency checking from Makefile
  * greeneye: change category 'Games' to 'Game' in order to comply with
    freedesktop.org XDG menu-spec.
  * filter.c: support case-insensitive non-ASCII search (issue #91)

Tue Oct 22 07:26:41 UTC 2019 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 3.5:
  * Add col2 theme
  * Some minor fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  7 05:40:48 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 3.4:
  * Add xfce4-panel plugin. Written-by: @Misko_2083
  * Add mate-panel plugin. This contrib/ package is still in early development.
    Written-by: @Misko_2083
  * Add the following themes: col3 and the latest bunsenlabs_lithium
  * Man pages have seen the following improvements:
    - Better html support and available at https://jgmenu.github.io/
    - A new jgmenuunicode(7) guide
    - jgmenu(1) details on IPC variables, widgets and special pango markup
      characters (thanks @johnraff)
  * Support sourcing of CSV files. Suggested-by: @johnraff
    Use the following syntax to include other files from CSV files
    . <file>
    Tilde (~) is expanded, but not environment variables.
  * In jgmenu, improve handling of tags.
    - Remove ^checkout() items without matching tags. This permits the
      default prepend.csv and append.csv files to include ^checkout()
      items which only appear if an optional package providing a sourced
      csv file is installed. Suggested-by: @johnraff
    - Die on duplicate tags
    - Survive missing tags when actioning ^checkout() and ^pipe().
      Reported-by: @johnraff
  * Improve apps module by filtering out duplicate .desktop files. For
    example if foo.desktop exists in ~/.local/share/applications/, then
    ignore foo.desktopp in /usr/share/applications/
  * Improve lx modules by ensuring tag names are unique
  * Improve ob module by
    - Escaping < and > to support pango markup
    - Fixing pipemenu inline menu bug. Reported-by: @johnraff
  * Add .clang-format and a wrapper to cope with foreach iterators
  * Minor fixes:
    - Survive unsupported locale (issue #96). If setlocale(LC_ALL, "")
      fails, use fallback 'C' locale
    - x11-ui.c: don't pull for XRandR hardware changes. Calling
       XRRGetScreenResources() pulls for hardware changes which on some
       systems freezes the screen for a few hundred milliseconds, so use
       XRRGetScreenResourcesCurrent() instead to avoid that.
       Written-by: @Roliga
    - Set arrow colour of selected item to color_sel_fg to match font
      colour (issue #99)
    - Fix border misalignment to ensure rounded corners are pixel
      perfect
  * Add config option `verbosity`. See jgmenu(1) for details.
  * Add config option `position_mode` and remove `at_pointer`
    `position_mode` can be one of pointer, ipc, fixed or center.
    See jgmenu(1) for full details.
    Backward compatibility is maintained by repecting at_pointer=1
  * Improve `jgmenu_run config` command by:
    - Creating config file if missing. Avoid failure of
      `jgmenu_run config -s <file> -k <key> -v <value>` if config file
       does not exist (by creating one).
    - Only setting key/value pair if new value is different. This
      avoids writing to jgmenurc file unnecessarily.
    - Amending missing items more intelligently by commenting out new
      key/value pairs
  * Add contrib/jgmenu-gtktheme.py. Written by @Misko-2083
    This is still a basic implementation which only sets color_menu_bg,
    color_norm_fg, color_sel_bg and color_sel_fg
    If your package maintainer has included this contrib/ package, try it out
    with: jgmenu init --apply-gtktheme

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 23 05:34:04 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 3.3:
  * In the obtheme module, add support for parsing BunsenLabs Lithium's
    bl-rc.xml to obtain the current openbox theme, thereby supporting
    jgmenu init --apply-obtheme without having to set an environment
    variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 18 12:50:14 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 3.2:
  * Fix incorrect selection after clearing a filter resulting in
  * Update debian/ file and modify unit test t1201-lx.t to enable clean
    run with pbuilder
  * Add jgmenu-hide-app.sh. Run jgmenu_run hide-app foo.desktop to hide
    application foo from menu generated by lx module
  * Resolve config file csv_cmd value apps to jgmenu_run apps, so
    that user only needs to specify csv_cmd = apps to use apps module
  * Add xfce4-panel plugin. Written-by @Misko-2083
    (Not installed by default)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  8 06:32:33 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 3.1:
  * In obtheme module, support openbox config file (rc.xml) user override
    by setting environment variable JGMENU_RCXML. For example:
    JGMENU_RCXML=$HOME/.config/openbox/bl-rc.xml jgmenu_run obtheme jgmenurc
    JGMENU_RCXML=$HOME/.config/openbox/bl-rc.xml jgmenu init --apply-obtheme
  * Minor updates to man pages
  * Fix incorrect relative path in unit test t1201-lx.t

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 22 09:04:11 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 3.0:
  * This release has a MAJOR bump as we have changed a few things in a
    non-backward compatible way:
      + The menu background colour is set to have no transparency by
        default (alpha changed from 85% to 100%)
      + tint2_look is set to 0 (false) by default. Although the alignment
        with tint2's config file can be convenient, it has caused confusion
        for a number of users.
      + The config module has been re-written in C (previously python).
        It has very similar functionality, but slighly different command
        line options. It is predominantly an internal command used by
        'init', so most users should not notice a difference.
  * Support scroll past top/bottom when using keyboard arrows (issue #90).
    When scrolling past the last item, the selection moves to the top, and
    vice versa. Suggested-by: @hhhorb
  * Add lithium-rc1 theme
  * Teach widgets module to accept keyword "auto" for fgcol.  If "auto" is
    specified instead of a "#rrggbb aa" value, the jgmenurc config file
    color_norm_fg value will be used. This is useful if you want widget
    text to take on the same colour as ordinary menu items.
  * Give menu items higher Z-order priority than widgets
  * Support movement betweeen widgets and items using keyboard. Simply
    press the <tab> button to toggle between the two. The 'greeneye' theme
    is a good place to try this out.
  * Use apps module in greeneye theme rather than lx. This enables users
    without the lx module to try it. The apps module will be a pmenu
    successor. Although it is not quite ready yet, it is good enough for
    this.
  * In the pmenu module, respect override .desktop files (issue #86). We
    now do not show .desktop files with the same filenames more than once.
    We look for .desktop files in "~/.local/share" and "$XDG_DATA_DIRS"
    before "/usr/share" and "/usr/local/share".
  * Lots of minor improvements, tweaks and fixes. See git log for full
    details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 08:32:11 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2.2.1:
  * Fix init module bug which prevents config file from being created

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 07:44:45 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2.2.:
  * Fix --hide-on-startup bug
  * Add 'obtheme' module which:
  + Reads content of in openbox's rc.xml
  + Finds and parses the associated openbox-3/themerc file
  + Sets the corresponding jgmenurc key/value pairs
  * Improvements to 'init' module:
  * add --apply-obtheme (as a wrapper for the new obtheme module)
  * use pmenu if ob does not exist for lab themes
  * add "missing" option to interactive mode
  * do not launch jgmenu on theme change
  * only backup when needed
  * Add config options color_title_{fg,bg,border} (where title refers
    to a separator with text)
  * tests/helper/Makefile: disable ASAN by default (issue #84)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 25 10:28:17 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2.1:
  * Hide separators when searching
  * Make ^filter() happily co-exist with type-to-search, by clearing
    any ^filer() invocation on type-to-search.  So, for example, if
    ^filter(#Network) has been applied and the user then starts
    typing, '#Network' is cleared.
  * Survive bad ^pipe() - i.e. one that returns error or no items
  * Make checkout_tag() survive invalid tag by simply reverting to
    the first menu item. This means that we now also sensibly handle
    --checkout=foo where foo does not exist. (Reported-by: @johnraff)
  * Check that pipe-menu tags are unique before loading. Trying deal
    with duplicate tags after the node structure has been created does
    not work, because we cannot tell which ^tag() correspond to which
    ^checkout().
  * Add config option 'edge_snap_x'. Snap to left hand edge if within
    specified distance from it. Note that this option is only
    applicable in at_pointer mode. 
  * (config) Simplify command 'amend' and also add --dryrun option to check for
     missing items, but without modifying jgmenurc
  * (config) Add command 'create' to create a new config file (jgmenurc) based
    on built-in default values.
  * (ob) Cope with commas in all fields (thanks @johnraff)
  * (init) Add greeneye to the built-in themes
    Try greeneye with `jgmenu init --theme=greeneye`
  * Add sharness (https://github.com/chriscool/sharness) and modify
    current unit-tests to run with it (Thanks @chriscool et al)
  * Remove redundant/superseded code, scripts, examples and tests
  * Lots of minor coding style and flawfinder fixes
  * Simplify Makefile
  * Make sure self_pipe is cleared in hide_menu() and positively
    check that menu is not hidden when opening a submenu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  1 07:15:11 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 2.0:
  * Support ^filter() markup, whereby ^filter(foo) in the command field
    invokes a search for the inner value 'foo'
  * filter: support multi-word search
  * Improve widgets API and fix minor issues
  * lx: output application categories as metadata
  * Add 'color_scroll_ind' and 'csv_i18n' config options
  * Add greeneye module
  * Fix KeyError bug in pmenu module (commit 3b4ba92)
  * Handle missing xsettings variables
  * i18n: support dirirectory name without '/' at end
  * ob: quote output correctly (issue #76)
  * Retire 'xdg' module (now in noncore/). Its functionality is covered
    by pmenu and lx.
  * Do not install 'ff-bookmarks' and 'places', just leave them in
    noncore/ for reference or manual install. These are not considered
    part of the core application and are too time-consuming to maintain
    across OSs.
  * Tidy up init module

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 28 09:14:49 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to version 1.6:
