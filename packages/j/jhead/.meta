  <title>Tool to Manipulate the Nonimage Part of EXIF Compliant JPEG Files</title>
  <description>Jhead is a command line utility for extracting digital camera settings
from the EXIF format files used by many digital cameras. It handles the
various confusing ways these can be expressed and displays them as
F-stop, shutter speed, and more. It is also able to reduce the size of
digital camera JPEG files without loss of information by deleting
thumbnails that digital cameras put into the EXIF header.</description>
