- Update to version 0.82
  * Bugs fixed:
    + dict - under some circumstances it was possible to add duplicate keys to a dict
    + file delete - -force and -- were handled incorrectly
    + aio: ssl - fix eof detection with openssl3
    + getref and setref - now accept fully qualified references
    + unset - donâ€™t return a result with -nocomplain
    + Garbage collection - sometimes GC was overly zealous
    + regexp - builtin regexp fix for end of word check
    + dict with - now correctly returns the script result
    + Unicode ranges are closed intervals. This affected the character class of the end character of each range.
  * Features and improvements added:
    + aio gets - improve behaviour for non-blocking streams
    + aio TIP 603 - implement stat of an open file handle
    + aio socket pty - filename is now available
    + Included sqlite updated to version 3.38.0
    + redis extension - enable TCP_KEEPALIVE, add support for -type and -async
    + try - add support for trap
    + oo constructor is now more flexible (possible incompatibility with 0.81)
    + socket - add support for -async
    + Updated linenoise now has support for word forward, word backward
    + Updated Unicode to 14.0.0
    + file normalize - now supported on Windows
    + aio copyto - performance improvement for large copies
    + Memory allocator is now replaceable
    + info frame is now more Tcl compatible (incompatibility with 0.81)
    + New timerate command for improved benchmarking - largely compatible with TIP 527
    + vwait - add support for -signal for improved handling of signals in the event loop
    + clock millis and clock micros - now use monotonic time if possible (not affected by system time changes)
    + ensemble and namespace ensemble simplify creation of ensemble commands
  * Possible incompatibilities in version 0.82
    + New approach to oo constructor means some existing code may need to be altered
    + info frame now returns a dict rather than a list and can access non-proc frames. stacktrace will continue to work and should be preferred when retrieving a live stack trace
    + New ABI version means that compiled extensions will need to be rebuilt to work with this version
- excluded ssl test from running inside build environment
