  <title>A SatCom ACARS demodulator and decoder for the Aero standard</title>
  <description>JAERO is a program that demodulates and decodes Classic Aero ACARS (Aircraft
Communications Addressing and Reporting System) messages sent from satellites to
Aeroplanes (SatCom ACARS) commonly used when Aeroplanes are beyond VHF range.

Demodulation is performed using the soundcard.

Such signals are typically around 1.5Ghz and can be received with a simple
low gain antenna that can be home brewed in a few hours in conjunction with a
cheap RTL-SDR dongle.
