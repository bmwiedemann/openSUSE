- Update to version 0.11.0:
  * Breaking changes
    - Conflicts are now stored in a different way. Commits written
      by a new jj binary will not be read correctly by older jj
      binaries. The new model solves some performance problems with
      the old model. For example, jj log should be noticeably
      faster on large repos. You may need to create a new clone to
      see the full speedup.
    - The remote_branches() revset now includes branches exported
      to the Git repository (so called Git-tracking branches.) Use
      remote_branches(remote=exact:"origin") to query branches of
      certain remote.
    - Status messages are now printed to stderr.
    - jj config set now interprets the value as TOML also if it's a
      valid TOML array or table. For example, jj config set --user
      'aliases.n' '["new"]'
    - Remote branches now have tracking or non-tracking flags. The
      git.auto-local-branch setting is applied only to newly
      fetched remote branches. Existing remote branches are
      migrated as follows:
      - If local branch exists, the corresponding remote branches
        are considered tracking branches.
      - Otherwise, the remote branches are non-tracking branches.
    - If the deduced tracking flags are wrong, use jj branch
      track/untrack commands to fix them up.
    - See automatic local branch creation for details.
    - Non-tracking remote branches aren't listed by default. Use jj
      branch list --all to show all local and remote branches.
    - It's not allowed to push branches if non-tracking remote
      branches of the same name exist.
    - Pushing deleted/moved branches no longer abandons the local
      commits referenced by the remote branches.
    - jj git fetch --branch now requires glob: prefix to expand *
      in branch name.
  * New features
    - jj's stable release can now be installed with cargo binstall
      jj-cli.
    - jj workspace add now takes a --revision argument.
    - jj workspace forget can now forget multiple workspaces at
      once.
    - branches()/remote_branches()/author()/committer()/description()
      revsets now support glob matching.
    - jj branch delete/forget/list, and jj git push --branch now
      support string pattern syntax. The --glob option is
      deprecated in favor of glob: pattern.
    - The branches/tags/git_refs/git_head template keywords now
      return a list of RefNames. They were previously pre-formatted
      strings.
    - The new template keywords local_branches/remote_branches are
      added to show only local/remote branches.
    - jj workspace add now preserves all parents of the old
      working-copy commit instead of just the first one.
    - jj rebase -r gained the ability to rebase a revision A onto a
      descendant of A.
  * Fixed bugs
    - Updating the working copy to a commit where a file that's
      currently ignored in the working copy no longer leads to a
      crash (#976).
    - Conflicts in executable files can now be resolved just like
      conflicts in non-executable files (#1279).
    - jj new --insert-before and --insert-after now respect
      immutable revisions (#2468).
