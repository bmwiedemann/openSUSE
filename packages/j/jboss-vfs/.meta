  <title>JBoss VFS</title>
  <description>JBoss VFS provides an API to represent a deployment as a read-only hierarchical file system regardless of whether it is packaged or not. It also allows deployments to be accessed both locally and remotely using a pluggable design so that new protocols can easily be added to those supplied by default (file, jar, memory).</description>
