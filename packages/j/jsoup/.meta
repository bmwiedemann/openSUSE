  <description>jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML.
It provides an API for extracting and manipulating data,
using DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification.

 - scrapes and parses HTML from a URL, file, or string
 - finds and extracts data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
 - manipulates the HTML elements, attributes, and text
 - cleans user-submitted content against a safe white-list,
   to prevent XSS attacks
 - outputs tidied HTML

jsoup can deal with invalid HTML tag soup.
