  <title>Java UI testing library</title>
  <description>Jemmy is a Java UI testing library. Jemmy represents the most natural way to 
test Java UI - perform the testing right from the Java code. Jemmy is a Java 
library which provides clear and straightforward API to access Java UI. Tests 
are then just java programs, which use the API. Having the tests in Java allows 
to use all the flexibility of high level language to capture test logic and 
also do any other operations needed to be done from test.</description>
