%description
LibEMF is a C/C++ library that provides a drawing toolkit based on
ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create vector
graphics files on POSIX systems that can be imported into StarOffice or
OpenOffice. The Enhanced MetaFile (EMF) is one of the two color vector
graphics format that is "vectorially" understood by SO and OO. The EMF
format also has the additional advantage that it can be "broken" into
its constituent components and edited like any other SO or OO graphics
object.
