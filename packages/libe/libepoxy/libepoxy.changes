- Remove pkgconfig dependecies for glesv1_cm and glesv2:
  Starting with mesa commit b01524fff05 
  "meson: don't build libGLES*.so with GLVND" mesa stopped providing
  glesv1_cm.pc and glesv2.pc along. Let epoxy find the libraries directly 
  instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Do a minor spec cleanup, use autosetup macro.
- Pass docs=false, glx=yes, egl=yes and x11=true to meson, ensure
  we build the features we want.

Wed Jan 10 21:57:40 UTC 2018 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- -devel package requires pkgconfig(x11), pkgconfig(egl)
   but those deps are not generated automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  6 10:16:41 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.3:
  + Require Meson 0.39.1; the previous release already had an
    implicit requirement on this version.
  + Allow disabling EGL support when building Epoxy.
  + Add support for building on Haiku.
  + Update EGL registry from Khronos.
- Switch to meson build:
  + Drop autoconf, automake and libtool BuildRequires, and drop
    conditional autogen.sh call.
  + Add meson BuildRequires and add meson macros, drop autotools
    macros.
- Correct docs installed.
- Use "Full and pretty" source name.
- Run spec-cleaner.
- Add pkgconfig(glesv1_cm) and pkgconfig(glesv2) BuildRequires:
  Build the optional gles v1 and v2 support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  4 10:36:06 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.2:
  * Add C++ guards around generated headers.
  * Add z,relro and z,now to the GCC linker flags.
  * Add explicit version flags for macOS builds.
  * Add missing visibility compiler flags.
  * Prefer using pkg-config files to find GLES.
  * Fix build on MSVC 2013 when using the inline keyword.
  * Fix dlwrap on aarch64.
  * Require Meson ≥ 0.38.1.
  * Allow building Epoxy as a Meson sub-project.
  * Avoid crashes when running Epoxy on X servers without GLX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar  4 09:04:55 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.1:
  * Find the appropriate version of the Python interpreter when
    building.
  * Ensure that the dispatch generation script works with Python
    2.x and 3.x.
  * Ensure that Epoxy builds correctly under Windows.
  * Fix location of the m4 macros in the autotools build.
- Changes from version 1.4.0:
  * Epoxy can now build with MSVC versions prior to 2013; we still
    recommend using a recent, C99-compatible compiler, like MSVC
    2015.
  * When used under X11, Epoxy now attempts to handle the cases
    where the GLX extension is not built or not available.
  * GLX can now be enabled and disabled at configuration time; this
    allows building Epoxy with GLX on macOS, and allows building
    Epoxy without GLX on embedded platforms.
  * Epoxy now exposes API that lets dependent projects safely check
    if platform API like GLX and EGL is available at run time.
  * EGL support has been improved on Windows, and made more
    resilient on other platforms.
  * Epoxy supports building with the Meson build system, which has
    Ninja, Visual Studio, and XCode backends.
  * Epoxy can generate its API reference using Doxygen (currently
    only available on Meson builds).
  * The GL registry has been updated with the latest version of the
    API references provided by Khronos; Epoxy now supports the API
    introduced by OpenGL 4.5.

Mon Jul 20 18:20:19 UTC 2015 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 1.3.1
  * brown-paper-bag fix to unexport another private symbol that we'd
    leaked, noticed when I went diffing the exported symbols between
    v1.2 and v1.3 for the debian build.
- Changes since 1.3.0:
  * MSVC 2013 support.
  * OSX drops GLX support.
  * Updates to the registry
  * Fixes for a nonconformant GL implementation
  * Library size reductions
  * Reproducible builds
- Drop u_sort-the-providers-by-their-enum-not-by-their-functi.patch,
  merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 26 11:42:39 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add baselibs.conf in order to build 32bit packages.

Thu Feb 12 10:13:10 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- u_sort-the-providers-by-their-enum-not-by-their-functi.patch
  * sort the providers by their enum not by their function name;
    patch by coolo (bnc#917533)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 17 12:52:18 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Update to 1.2
  *This is a bugfix and feature release. On the feature side of
   things, it brings in an updated registry with support for
   GLES 3.1 and EGL 1.5, along with miscellaneous other extensions,
   and many more aliases for GLES functions. On the bugfix side,
   it should be much more portable to non-Mesa drivers (nvidia binary
   in particular) and systems with mixed Mesa and non-Mesa drivers,
   and actually install the wgl headers in the windows build.
- Explicitly BuildRequire pkgconfig(x11), and don't count other
  packages drag it in
- Drop git_fixes.patch, merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 26 20:11:18 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Init libepoxy package
