  <title>Library implementing the eCAP interface for application filtering modules</title>
  <description>eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an HTTP
proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to a
loadable module. The functionality is similar to the ICAP protocol (RFC 3507),
but implemented as function calls instead of network interactions.</description>
