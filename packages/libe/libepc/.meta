  <title>Easy Publish and Consume Library</title>
  <description>The Easy Publish and Consume library provides an easy method to:

    * publish data using HTTPS: EpcPublisher
    * announce that information via DNS-SD: EpcDispatcher
    * find that information: EpcConsumer
    * and finally consume it

You can use this library as a key/value store published to the network,
using encryption, authentication and service discovery.</description>
