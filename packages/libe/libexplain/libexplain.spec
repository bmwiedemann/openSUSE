%description
The libexplain project provides a library which may be used to explain
Unix and Linux system call errors. This will make an application's
error messages much more informative to users. The library is
not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror, but it comes close. Each
system call has a dedicated libexplain function.

The coverage for system calls is being improved all the time. Coverage
includes 159 system calls and 444 ioctl requests.

%description -n explain
The explain command is used to decode an error return read from an
strace(1) listing, or similar.  Because this is being deciphered in a
different process than the original one, the results will be less accurate
than if the program itself were to use libexplain(3).
