- Update to release 0.4.1
  * ei_setup_backend_portal() was removed. The portal it
    connected to never really existed and all the efforts since
    have gone into supporting libei connections through the
    RemoteDesktop and the InputCapture portals. Note that these
    changes are not yet merged into upstream xdg-desktop-portal.
  * a new library "liboeffis" takes the place of the above. It is
    a helper library to connect to the RemoteDesktop portal via
    DBus with a minimal API and retrieve the EIS socket. This
    library is intended to be used by tools that cannot easily
    talk DBus themselves (this includes Xwayland).
  * the libei/libeis log handlers have a new API which makes
    handling log messages a bit simpler.
  * version exchange between client/server make it possible (in
    the future) to have multiple supported protocol versions.

- Update to release 0.3
  * libei now supports the concept of sender/receiver contexts. A
    libei context in sender mode can send events to the
    (EIS-created) devices, a libei context in receiver mode can
    receive events from the (EIS-created) devices. This allows
    for libei to be used as a transport layer for captured input
    events.
  * A libei context can bind/unbind to seat capabilities
    individually at any time
  * Frame events now carry a timestamp
  * A helper tool ei-debug-events is now available, this tool can
    be used in e.g. portal implementation to show the events
    being sent.
