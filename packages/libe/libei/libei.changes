- Update to release 0.99.1
  * The protocol no longer has a fixed capability enum, the
    bitmask is based on the available interfaces. See the
    ei_seat.capability event in the protocol documentation.
  * New interfaces for button and scroll - these were split out
    from the previously merged pointer/pointer_absolute
    interfaces. Clients need to bind to those in addition to
    binding to pointer and/or pointer_absolute. EIS
    implementations need to provide those separately in addition
    to pointer/pointer_absolute.
  * A number of APIs have been renamed to adjust for this, e.g.
    ei_event_pointer_get_scroll_x() is now
    ei_event_scroll_get_dx()
  * ei_seat_bind_capability() was removed, use
    ei_seat_bind_capabilities() instead
  * The pkgconfig files are now libei-1.0.pc, libeis-1.0.pc,
    liboeffis-1.0.pc
- Delete ver.diff (obsolete), system-munit.diff (deactivate for now)

- Update to release 0.5
  * The previously protobuf-based ad-hoc protocol has changed to
    custom format defined in the protocol.xml file. This protocol
    is heavily influenced by the Wayland protocol but not binary
    compatible. The protocol is not yet stable.
  * ei_get_version() has been removed, with the protocol having
    per-interface versions this is no longer useful.
  * ei_device_start_emulating() now takes a sequence number.
  * Support for properties has been removed.
  * libreis has been removed.

- Update to release 0.4.1
  * ei_setup_backend_portal() was removed. The portal it
    connected to never really existed and all the efforts since
    have gone into supporting libei connections through the
    RemoteDesktop and the InputCapture portals. Note that these
    changes are not yet merged into upstream xdg-desktop-portal.
  * a new library "liboeffis" takes the place of the above. It is
    a helper library to connect to the RemoteDesktop portal via
    DBus with a minimal API and retrieve the EIS socket. This
    library is intended to be used by tools that cannot easily
    talk DBus themselves (this includes Xwayland).
  * the libei/libeis log handlers have a new API which makes
    handling log messages a bit simpler.
  * version exchange between client/server make it possible (in
    the future) to have multiple supported protocol versions.

- Update to release 0.3
  * libei now supports the concept of sender/receiver contexts. A
    libei context in sender mode can send events to the
    (EIS-created) devices, a libei context in receiver mode can
    receive events from the (EIS-created) devices. This allows
    for libei to be used as a transport layer for captured input
    events.
  * A libei context can bind/unbind to seat capabilities
    individually at any time
  * Frame events now carry a timestamp
  * A helper tool ei-debug-events is now available, this tool can
    be used in e.g. portal implementation to show the events
    being sent.
