Mon Feb  5 09:29:58 UTC 2024 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.2.1
  * Previously, using OEFFIS_DEVICE_ALL_DEVICES in
    oeffis_create_session() would erroneously result in the portal
    selecting no devices instead of all.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  6 08:31:30 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.2
  * if the write buffer is full, outgoing messages are now cached
    instead of returning EAGAIN.
  * if a message send fails, stop trying to send more messages
    which will do nothing but spam the log with more errors
  * if we get disconnected by the server, stop trying to send
    things to the server (and spam the log on error)
  * use EINTR checks instead of blocking SIGALRM
  * keep a cache of defunct objects to avoid spamming the log when
    there are in-flight messages arriving after destroy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 06:04:28 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.1
  * Correct documentation for ei_touch_(get|set)_user_data

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 09:28:28 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.901 (1.1.0~rc1)
  * ei_device_get_region_at() and its libeis equivalent was added
    as a helper to obtain a device's region at a given point.
  * ei_region_get_mapping_id() returns the mapping id previously
    set by the EIS implementation via
    eis_region_set_mapping_id(). This mapping id can be used to
    identify external resources that have a relationship with
    this region.
    This is a protocol addition and bumps the ei_device protocol
    to version 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  8 13:10:22 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.0.0
  * Protocol:
  * ei_connection.sync now takes a version argument to allow for
    future updates of the ei_callback interface. This is a
    protocol change.
  * The ei-scanner now exposes interface_arg + interface_arg_for
    and version_arg + version_arg_for to allow for better
    handling of arguments that refer to interfaces or versions,
    respectively.
  * Library:
  * The enum eis_event_type was synced with libei so identical
    events have the same enum value in both libraries.
  * A few missing functions are now public too.
  * libeis _for now_ sends all negotiated interface versions back
    to the client during the initial handshake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 12:50:07 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.99.2
  * Export the event names through helper functions
  * scanner: add the Interface.plainname property

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 17 09:20:52 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.99.1
  * The protocol no longer has a fixed capability enum, the
    bitmask is based on the available interfaces. See the
    ei_seat.capability event in the protocol documentation.
  * New interfaces for button and scroll - these were split out
    from the previously merged pointer/pointer_absolute
    interfaces. Clients need to bind to those in addition to
    binding to pointer and/or pointer_absolute. EIS
    implementations need to provide those separately in addition
    to pointer/pointer_absolute.
  * A number of APIs have been renamed to adjust for this, e.g.
    ei_event_pointer_get_scroll_x() is now
    ei_event_scroll_get_dx()
  * ei_seat_bind_capability() was removed, use
    ei_seat_bind_capabilities() instead
  * The pkgconfig files are now libei-1.0.pc, libeis-1.0.pc,
    liboeffis-1.0.pc
- Delete ver.diff (obsolete), system-munit.diff (deactivate for now)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  6 13:12:49 UTC 2023 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.5
  * The previously protobuf-based ad-hoc protocol has changed to
    custom format defined in the protocol.xml file. This protocol
    is heavily influenced by the Wayland protocol but not binary
    compatible. The protocol is not yet stable.
  * ei_get_version() has been removed, with the protocol having
    per-interface versions this is no longer useful.
  * ei_device_start_emulating() now takes a sequence number.
  * Support for properties has been removed.
  * libreis has been removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 10:10:37 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.4.1
  * ei_setup_backend_portal() was removed. The portal it
    connected to never really existed and all the efforts since
    have gone into supporting libei connections through the
    RemoteDesktop and the InputCapture portals. Note that these
    changes are not yet merged into upstream xdg-desktop-portal.
  * a new library "liboeffis" takes the place of the above. It is
    a helper library to connect to the RemoteDesktop portal via
    DBus with a minimal API and retrieve the EIS socket. This
    library is intended to be used by tools that cannot easily
    talk DBus themselves (this includes Xwayland).
  * the libei/libeis log handlers have a new API which makes
    handling log messages a bit simpler.
  * version exchange between client/server make it possible (in
    the future) to have multiple supported protocol versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 06:44:15 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.3
  * libei now supports the concept of sender/receiver contexts. A
    libei context in sender mode can send events to the
    (EIS-created) devices, a libei context in receiver mode can
    receive events from the (EIS-created) devices. This allows
    for libei to be used as a transport layer for captured input
    events.
  * A libei context can bind/unbind to seat capabilities
    individually at any time
  * Frame events now carry a timestamp
  * A helper tool ei-debug-events is now available, this tool can
    be used in e.g. portal implementation to show the events
    being sent.

Wed Mar  2 08:00:57 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 0.2
  * Development snapshot, no curated changelog available.
