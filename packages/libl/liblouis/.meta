  <title>Braille Translator and Back-Translator</title>
  <description>Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator.
It features support for computer and literary braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages
and has support for hyphenation. New languages can easily be added
through tables that support a rule- or dictionary based approach.

Liblouis also supports math braille (Nemeth and Marburg). The
formatting of braille is provided by the companion project
liblouisxml.

Liblouis is based on the translation routines in the BRLTTY
screenreader for Linux. It has, however, gone far beyond these
routines. It is named in honor of Louis Braille.

Included are also tools for testing and debugging tables.</description>
