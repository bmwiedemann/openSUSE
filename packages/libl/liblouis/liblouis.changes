- update to 3.21.0:
  * New table for German 6-dot computer braille thanks to the Swiss Library for
    the Blind, Visually Impaired and Print Disabled 
  * see http://liblouis.org/liblouis/2022/03/07/liblouis-release-3.21.0.html
    for list of bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 20:12:50 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.20.0:
  * This is a major release. Not only in terms of table additions and
    updates but also in the way the tables are written. Bert has replaced the
    ~uplow~ opcode with a more generalized ~base~ opcode. This clears
    up the path for a more generalized handling of emphasis and uppercase
    characters. In the course of this simplification some bugs with
    computer braille were discovered and fixed.
  * For this release Bert Frees has been hard at work to clean up the code
    base. He fixed a few bugs one of which was causing memory corruption.
    Others have contributed corrections to braille tables or even provided
    new tables. For example there are now tables for Tshivenda and for
    Russian contracted braille.
  * This release brings support for many new languages: There is support
    for six new languages from South Africa, Northern Kurdish, Kazakh,
    Tatar, Yakut, Bulgarian literary braille and finally Khmer, Burmese
    and Vietnamese. Aside from that there are also major improvements to
    Afrikaans, Russian literary braille, Uzbek and Hebrew Computer
    Braille.
  * This release stands in the tradition of small incremental improvements
    that make it another fine and solid release. Andrey Yakuboy put in a
    lot of work to improve Russian literary and computer braille. He also
    provided a new table for Belarusian uncontracted and computer braille.
    Aside from that there are numerous improvements in Braille tables such
    as French, Polish and Urdu. The documentation has been improved as has
    the table meta marking the tables whether they are geared towards
    forward or backwards translation. I'd like to thank everybody for
    helping to bring liblouis forward.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 20 19:04:33 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.15.0:
  + Long list of changes, see included NEWS file.
- Change sover to 20, following upstreams ABI bump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 19 16:01:51 UTC 2019 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Update to version 3.11.0:
  + A tremendous amount of work by Dave Mielke and Bert Frees
    has gone into this release. They have improved liblouis for use
    on note taker devices, for backwards translation and a number
    of languages. Many other contributors (listed below) have also
    helped in fixing bugs and improving braille tables, such as
    Dutch, Mongolian, Polish, Ancient Greek, Danish, Irish,
    Chinese, and American Braille Computer Code.
  + New features:
    - Enable ~always~ rules with a single character and a single
    braille cell for back-translation.
    - Implement ~noUndefined~ mode for forward translation.
    - Use fallback braille representations (NABCC) for rendering
      undefined characters in hexadecimal notation.
    - Always render undefined characters, also ASCII characters, in
      hexadecimal notation.
    - Add a new metadata field ~index-name~ for selecting a table
      from a list fast and efficiently. It has the most important
      information first and no redundant information. It should
      look nice when sorted.  This in contrast to the existing
      ~display-name~ field which is for describing a table
      accurately and should sound good.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Don't let a caps passage end on a word with no letters.
    - Handle word resets in the last word of an caps or emphasis
      passage if the end indicator was placed before the word.
    - Never convert to lowercase if ~capsletter~ is not defined.
    - Fix position mapping for back-translation when ~noUndefined~
      mode is active.
    - Fix bug where a translation would hang on words that match
      both a ~nocont~ and a ~repeated~ rule.
    - Fix bug where the effect of ~capsnocont~ would leak to the
      next word if that word starts with a capital.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Other changes:
    - The python wrapper now encodes and decodes strings to/from
      UTF-16 and UTF-32 using the surrogatepass error handler. This
      ensures that single UTF-16 surrogate characters are processed
      correctly by the wrapper and don't raise an encoding/decoding
      error.
    - Metadata keys and values are now case insensitive.
    - Remove ~unicodedefs.cti~. It was obsolete and never meant
      to be included by any tables. Instead use the online
      references as mentioned in the documentation now.
    - ~lou_checkyaml~ test reporting has been improved.
    - Hyphenation tables have been removed from tables except
      those needed for ~nocross~ rules.
    - ~lou_hyphenate~ can now handle more than just words
      (sequences of letters), e.g compound words.
  + Deprecation notice: - The ~noUndefinedDots~ mode has been
    renamed to ~noUndefined~. For backwards compatibility
    ~noUndefinedDots~ is still available in the header file and in
    the Python bindings, as an alias for ~noUndefined~.
  + Backwards incompatible changes: None.
  + Changes in version 3.10.0:
  + This release comes across as quiet, containing just the usual
    assortment of braille table improvements, cleanups, bug fixes
    and the classic buffer overflow patches. But beware, a lot has
    happened behind the scenes. Bert and Davy have been adding a
    new opcode to handle special emphasis situations. A number of
    annoying restrictions with regards to names, such as class
    names have been removed thank to Bert.  And lastly
    also thanks to Bert it is now possible to define inline display
    tables in your YAML tests.
  + New features:
    - Add a new opcode ~emphmodechars~.
  + Bug fixes
    - Remove memoization in ~checkAttr~. It wasn't implemented
      correctly, caused some weird bugs and probably didn't do much
      for performance.
    - Fix multiple buffer overflows in ~compilePassOpcode~.
    - Fix a build problem when building without libyaml.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Other changes:
    - Remove various restrictions on which characters and braille
      cells can be used in translation rules.
    - Remove some code duplication in ~pattern.c~.
    - It is now also possible to define inline tables when a display
      table has been defined.
  + Deprecation notice: None.
  + Backwards incompatible changes: None.
  + Changes in version 3.9.0:
  + This release has seen a tremendous amount of work by Bert
    Frees. He was instrumental in pushing the improvements for
    Latvian, Norwegian and Slovenian. But most prominently he
    pushed the big change for space and control character
    handling through the door. These characters are now no longer
    hard coded in liblouis. This should solve a few long standing
    issues. Other than that there is the usual assortment of code
    improvements and cleanups.
  + New features: None.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Fix a problem in the callback registration in the Python
      bindings.
    - Fixed memory leaks created by block scope compound literals.
    - The hard coded rules dealing with white space have been
      replaced with a normal table that is included in all tables.
      This fixes a number of bugs to do with space and control
      characters. This (big) change has been brewing for a couple
      of releases and has finally landed.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Other changes:
    - Don't search for tables in ~/usr/local/share/liblouis/tables~
      (or the Windows equivalent) if ~LOUIS_TABLEPATH~ is set.
    - The log levels in ~liblouis.h~ are no longer exposed as
      ~LOG_FOO~ but instead are now prefixed. So ~LOG_WARN~ becomes
      ~LOU_LOG_WARN~ for example to issue a warning from a C
      program using liblouis. The actual values remain the same,
      so the ABI remains stable.
  ** Deprecation notice
    - The ~locale~ opcode was never implemented and was just
      silently ignored. It is now removed from the tables and a
      warning will be issued if it is found in a table.
- Drop
    gcc9-fixed-memory-leaks-created-by-block-scope-compound-l.patch
    fixed upstream.
- Sover is now 19.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  6 01:29:27 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.8.0:
  + Noteworthy changes in this release: The major focus of this
    release is on braille table updates. There are major updates to
    German, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Dutch, Czech, Latvian,
    Spanish and Ethiopic. Some of these new tables have only been
    possible because Bert Frees fixed some nasty long standing bugs
    behind the scene. Also there is the usual assortment of code
    improvements and cleanups.
  + New features: None.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Fix support more than 4 classes.
    - Fix capitalization of words that match nocont rules.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Other changes: Updated the lou_allround and lou_trace test
    tools to include all the mode flags described in the
    documentation of the lou_translateString() function.
  + Backwards incompatible changes: The pass1Only flag has been
    deprecated for a while and is now removed from the code.
- Bump sover define to 17, following upstreams soname bump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 21 20:08:22 UTC 2018 - mgorse@suse.com

- Update to version 3.7.0 (boo#1109319)
  + New features

      defined with this opcode can appear in the middle or at the
      end of a number without canceling numeric mode.
  + Bug fixes
    - Fix another stack-based buffer overflow in input parsing
      reported by Henri Salo thanks to Christian Egli.
    - Fix input/output positions for back-translation.
    - Major improvements in the back-translation of capitalized words
    - Fixed a problem in the back-translation of numbers in
      conjunction with punctuation and letters.
    - Fix a buffer overflow in ~matchCurrentInput~.
  + Braille table improvements
  + Other changes
    - Added documentation of opcodes which were previously
      introduced as part of the UEB work.
    - Removal of the code for the /scripting language/ for
      multipass opcodes. This code was originally introduced in
      2012 but never documented. Consequently it was never used.
      Meanwhile the original code for multipass opcodes was much
      improved. So there is no more need for this (duplicate)
      code and we are removing it.
  + New tables: zhcn-g1.ctb, zhcn-g2.ctb
- Drop CVE-2018-12085.patch: fixed upstream.

- Updated to version 3.5.0:
  + New features
    - The same name can now be used in more than one ~class~ rule.
      The effect is that both set of characters become part of that
      one class.
  + Bug fixes
    - Fix a regression in inputPositions thanks to Bert Frees
    - Treat characters within the range ~compbrlStart~ and
      ~compbrlEnd~ as a special case. This fixes many if not most
      of the problems with cursor position and the
      ~compbrlAtCursor~ mode. Thanks to Dave Mielke.
    - Fix ~swapdd~ opcode thanks to Bert Frees
    - Fix negation of attribute matcher in multipass expressions
      thanks to Bert Frees
  + Braille table improvements
  + Backwards incompatible changes
    - The translation mode ~comp8Dots~ has been removed as it was
      never really implemented anyway
    - Support for the ~pass1Only~ flag has now been removed. Thanks
      to Bue Vester-Andersen.
    - The old UEB tables ~UEBC-g1.ctb~ and ~UEBC-g2.ctb~ have been
      removed as the have been superseded by ~en-ueb-g1.ctb~ and
      ~en-ueb-g2.ctb~.
    - The french tables ~fr-2007.ctb~, ~fr-fr-g1.utb~,
      ~fr-fr-g2.ctb~, ~fr-ca-g1.utb~ and ~fr-ca-g2.ctb~ have been
      removed. Use ~fr-bfu-comp6.utb~ for 6 dots literary,
      ~fr-bfu-comp8.utb~ for 8 dots computer and ~fr-bfu-g2.ctb~
      for contracted braille instead.
- Updated to version 3.4.0:
  + New features
    - Add support for ~inputPos~ and ~outputPos~ checking in
      ~lou_checkyaml~ thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen. See the manual
      for details and examples.
  + Bug fixes
    - output positions (~outputPos~) are now calculated based on
      input positions (~inputPos~) thanks to Bert Frees. This
      avoids a whole class of bugs that previously plagued the
      output positions. This fix also obviates the need for the
      ~pass1Only~ flag. See below for the deprecation notice.
  + Braille table improvements

Wed Sep  6 15:34:40 UTC 2017 - mgorse@suse.com

- Update to version 3.3.0:
  + New features
    - A new tool ~lou_maketable~ enables the creation of tables
      based on a corpus of known good Braille translations. This
      has huge potential to simplify table maintenance for tables
      that have so far been dominated by large exception lists.

      table meta data
  + UEB Grade 2:
    - Fix back-translation of whole word contractions followed
      by other contractions
    + Fix back-translation for contractions followed by

      boo#1056090 (CVE-2017-13743), and boo#1056088
      (CVE-2017-13744)
  + Braille table improvements
- Changes from version 3.2.0: 
  + Bug fixes
    - Fix capsnocont opcode. Also mark capital letters with
      capsletter symbol when capsnocont is defined but no
      begcapsword indicator is defined.
    - Fix the syllable opcode. It had been broken under some
      circumstances since 3.0.
  + Other changes
    + Fix building of Python bindings when cross-compiling.
    - lou_checkyaml is now only installed if libyaml is available.
    - Enhance documentation on usage of display tables in
    particular
  in conjunction with Unicode dot patterns.
  + Braille table improvements
- Changes from version 3.1.0:
  + New features:
    - Most of the translation tables now contain meta data. This
      makes them discoverable. Programs can use the lou_findTable
      function to find a table based on a query.
    - Add a noUndefinedDots mode to disable the output of dot
      numbers when back-translating undefined patterns.
    - When back translating input from a braille keyboard cell by
      cell, it is desirable to output characters as soon as they
      are produced.  Similarly, when back translating contracted
      braille, it is desirable to provide a "guess" to the user of
      the characters they typed. To achieve this, liblouis needs to
      have the ability to produce no text when indicators (which
      don't produce a character by themselves) are not followed by
      another cell. This works already for indicators liblouis
     knows about such as capital sign, number sign, etc., but it
      does not work for indicators which are not (and cannot be)
      specifically defined as indicators. For example, in UEB, dots
      4 5 6 alone produces the text "\456/". Setting the
      noUndefinedDots mode suppresses this dot number output.
      - Add a partialTrans mode to specify that back-translation
      input should be treated as an incomplete word. If this mode
      is set, rules that apply only for complete words or at the
      end of a word will not take effect. This is intended to be
      used when translating input typed on a braille keyboard to
      provide a rough idea to the user of the characters they are
      typing before the word is complete.
  + Bug fixes
    - - Fixes implicit declaration of 'pattern_check'
    - Fix a stackoverflow crash on applications with smaller stack
      size.
    - Fix the \v escape sequence.
    - The Python bindings now give a helpful error if liblouis has
      been compiled with a different character size than Python.
    - Massive bug fixes in multipass rules. Dave Mielke has done a
      tremendous job improving the multipass machinery also in the
      context of back-translation. Where needed nofor/noback has
      been added to the multipass rules.
  + Other changes
    - Improvements to the Emacs mode for editing liblouis tables
    - Documenting lou_charSize
  + Braille table improvements
  + License changes
    - DocArch has agreed to re-license their tables, so we have 8
      more tables under the LGPLv2.1+.
- Changes from version 3.0.0:
  + New features
    - Numerous features to support UEB properly.
    - support the many emphasis classes needed for UEB.
    - support translation of numbers according to the rules of UEB.
    - Capitalization is now handled just like emphasis.
    - support for numeric mode
    - UTF-8 support for all tools
    - Add ~lou_checkTable~ and ~lou_getTypeformForEmphClass~ to

Wed Oct 21 18:49:50 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.6.4:
  + New features: YAML based harness tests. Harness tests can now
    be written in simple YAML notation and they are integrated with
    the normal `make check' command. They can be used for both ucs2
    and ucs4 and no Python is required.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Use a separate gnulib instance for the library and the tools.
      Use the strndup module to avoid build problems on windows.
    - Fix a problem with the nocross opcode when used in
      combination with the opcodes nocont and compbrl.
    - Fix a problem with the decoding of the harness test files.
    - Fix numerous problems in the way braille indicators are
      handled. There is now a safe version of the checkAttr
      function which makes sure that no attributes are checked
      beyond the boundaries of the currentInput. This fixes the
      random behavior with tests where the emphasis extends to the
      end of the input string.
  + Other changes:
    - If found use texi2any to build the documentation.
    - Fix permissions of Korean tables.
    - Update the windows build instructions.
  + Braille table improvements:
- Changes from version 2.6.3:
  + New features:
    - [beta] The new function lou_findTable can be used for table
      discovery based on meta data in table headers.
    - The Python API now has a new function to check tables aptly
      named ~checkTable~.
  + Bug fixes: Fixed a problem in resolveTable when using a Java
    resolver.
  + Other changes: The build dependency on makeinfo is now
    optional. If it is not installed we simply do not build the
    documentation.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Corrections and improvements made to UEB tables.
- Changes from version 2.6.2:
  + New features: Harness tests now can test for typeform
    differences.
  + Bug fixes: Fix for emphasis bug.
  + Braille table improvements.
- Changes from version 2.6.1:
  + New features: New Braille tables.
  + Braille table improvements.
  + Bug fixes: Fix a compiler warning in the logging code.
  + Documentation updates: The documentation has been restructured
    to be more beginner friendly and a short introduction to
    translation table writing has been added.
  + Other changes:
    - When compiling with mingw or cygwin resulting dll is
      liblouis.dll.
    - runHarness.py: add new output format, compact output mode
      suitable for grepping.
  + Backwards incompatible changes:
    - Deleted ga.ctb now superseded by ga-g1.utb and ga.g2.ctb.
    - Nl-Nl-g1.utb has been removed. It is superseded by
      nl-NL-g1.ctb.
    - nl-be-g1.utb has been removed. It is superseded by
      nl-BE-g1.ctb.
- Changes from version 2.6.0:
  + New features:
    - New Braille tables.
    - Logging callback. There is now a callback system in place to
      get error messages and warnings.
  + Bug fixes:
    - Fix back translation problems when word gets split in unusual
      places causing back translation of whole words.
    - Fixed bug to prevent removal of \xffff between largesign
      rules.
    - Fixed a bug in back translation, when a letsign was
      encountered, the letsign was being applied beyond the element
      it applied to.
    - Fix memory leaks in the default table resolver introduced in
      the previous release.
    - Fixes to the build system.
  + Braille table improvements.
- Bump soname following upstream changes, leading to rename of
  package liblouis2 to liblouis9.
- Update url and sourceurl to new working ones.
- Add exlicit makeinfo BuildRequires, we want to build
  documentation.

    - Fixed a problem with syllable opcode.
    - Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2.
    - When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path,
      the "includes" in that table will now work as expected,
      meaning files in the same directory will be found.
  + Braille Table Improvements to fr-bfu-comp8, en-us-g2,
    en-ueb-g2, BUlgarian, en-gb-g1, Nemeth, Slovenian, Norwegian,
    Nepali, Danish.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 22 09:44:44 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.5.3:
  + New features:
    - New Braille tables.
      . Korean grade 1 and grade 2.
      . U.K. English 8 dot computer braille table.
      . New Russian literary and computer braille tables. These
        replace the older Russian tables which are left for
        backwards compatibility.
      . New hyphenation dictionary for Russian.
      . Updated hyphenation tables for the Norwegian language
        (nynorsk and bokmål).
      . New hyphenation dictionary for Esperanto.
      . New Esperanto grade 1 table, using the x system for
        accented letters.
    - runHarness.py:
      . Accept filename globs on the commandline to run specific
        harness files. In tests/harness, one can do make <filename>
        or make runall Removed from make check because these checks
        are checking the validity of our tables, rather than
        validity of the code.
  + Braille Table Improvements:
    - da-dk-g2.ctb, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation
      table.
    - Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace
      statements, if you need to compress whitespace, consider
      adding compress.ctb to the list of tables when processing.
    - Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 1 and 2).
    - Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots
      Braille table (Es-Es-G0.utb).
    - Corrections for double angle quotation marks and emphasis
      marks in the Norwegian Grade 0 Braille Table.
    - Fixes for a minor problem regarding the noletsign in
      Norwegian contracted braille.
    - Corrections to the Italian table.
    - Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table.
    - Corrections to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) table.
    - Further reorganization of the tables to remove duplication.
      Move litdigit opcode common parts and include where needed.
    - Removed obsolete en-us-g1.utb, which has been replaced by
      en-us-g1.ctb.
    - Added dictionary harness tests for: en-ueb-g2.ctb,
      en-us-g2.ctb.
    - Corrections to Nemeth character definitions.
    - Corrections to the Esperanto table.
  + Bug Fixes:
    - Cursor position calculation is now based on the same code
      that calculates inpos and outpos. This probably solves a
      number of bugs.
    - Fix nocross opcode processing.
    - Fix several buffer over/under runs in
      lou_translateString.c:hyphenate.
    - Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix inputPositions calculation for
      the case where the equals sign is used as the dots operand.
    - Fix a bug when resizing a table. Previously not all
      references to this table were updated.
  + Backwards incompatible changes:
    - The feature that allowed a mapping between language code and
      Braille table was removed as it contained a out-of-bounds
      access bug, was never documented and probably never used.

- Create a tools and a doc subpackages to contain the tools and
  documentation shipped by liblouis, instead of having a liblouis
  subpackage, since that's confusing (because what people are
  usually interested is the liblouis2 subpackage).
- Ship COPYING.LIB in liblouis2 subpackage and COPYING in the tools
  subpackage since everything is LGPL-3.0+, except the tools that
  are GPL-3.0+. That fixes bnc#779253.
