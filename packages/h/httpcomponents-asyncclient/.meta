  <title>Apache components to build asynchronous client side HTTP services</title>
  <description>Asynch HttpClient is a HTTP/1.1 compliant HTTP agent implementation based on
HttpCore NIO and HttpClient components. It is a complementary module to
Apache HttpClient intended for special cases where ability to handle
a great number of concurrent connections is more important than performance
in terms of a raw data throughput.
