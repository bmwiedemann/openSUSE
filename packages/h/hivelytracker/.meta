  <title>Music tracker for AHX and HVL formats</title>
  <description>Hively Tracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created
in the mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively
popular, and many songs were created and used in scene productions and
games. AHX was designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.

HivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX
format, but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has
its own instrument and module formats.

HivelyTracker offers the following features over AHX:
 * Multichannel (4 to 16 channels)
 * Per-channel stereo panning
 * Two commands per note instead of one
 * Ring modulation
 * A more feature rich editor
