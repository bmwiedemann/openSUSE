  * Vertex position fix for taus in dipole shower events.
- Add Herwig-type-mismatch-fix.patch to fix data of incorrect type

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 13 17:51:39 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Rename from libHerWig1 to Herwig-libs as the package does not
  satisfy the SLPP guideline: there are a number of non-.so.1
  files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 16 09:28:43 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim history lesson from description

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 03:15:10 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Rename shared library, adding the so number from
  libHerwigAPI.so; the so numbers of the other shared libraries
  are expected to be incremented by upstream in step with this.
- Move config file to -devel pkg in keeping with shlib packaging
  policy.
- Added obsoletes/provides for Herwig++ which will now be dropped
  from Factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 11 11:49:19 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Initial package.
- Add Herwig-disable-repo-install.patch: Disable post-install
  hooks intended to set up the Herwig repo, this doesn't work
  inside the build script because of missing LHAPDF data that
  needs to be installed by the user; the install-hook doesn't
  serve any purpose while building the rpm and users can easily
  set this up on their own.
