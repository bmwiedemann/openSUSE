%description
Homeshick is a tool for users to manage configuration files, also known as
dotfiles. It leverages Git repositories to store and version dotfiles, and to
synchronize dotfile repositories between accounts and/or machines.

For example, this allows managing personal dotfiles alongside emacs or vim
plugins without clutter. It also makes it easy to install large external
frameworks, such as oh-my-zsh, found on sites like https://dotfiles.github.io/.
