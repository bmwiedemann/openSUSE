  <title>Dotfile synchronizer based on Git and Bash</title>
  <description>In Unix, configuration files are king.  Tailoring tools to suit your needs
through configuration can be empowering.  An immense number of hours is spent
on getting these adjustments just right, but once you leave the confines of
your own computer, these local optimizations are left behind.

Homeshick is a tool for users to manage configuration files, also known as
dotfiles. It leverages Git repositories to store and version dotfiles, and to
synchronize dotfile repositories between accounts and/or machines.

For example, this allows installing large external frameworks (such as
oh-my-zsh, or a multitude of emacs or vim plugins) found on sites like
https://dotfiles.github.io/ alongside personal dotfiles without clutter.
