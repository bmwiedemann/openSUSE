    - In backlog you might see two text markers (âˆ™). This is
      because we didn't want to update the entire history, when we
      updated the way we construct text components. New history
      from this release wont have multiple markers.
    - Your old themes are broke since we updated to a new format.
      Find themes in the new format here: theme community.
