- Update to version 1.2.4 
  This patch release fixes a number of bugs and inconsistencies found
  since version 1.2.3 and is generally recommended for all users.

  Added

  * Forward compatibility for .h2song, .h2pattern, .h2playlist, and
    drumkit changes introduced in version 2.0.
  * MIDI and OSC commands
  * CLEAR_SELECTED_INSTRUMENT - to remove all notes of the selected
    pattern associated with the currently selected instrument.
  * CLEAR_PATTERN - to remove all notes of the selected pattern.
  * INSTRUMENT_PITCH - to adjust the pitch of an instrument.
  * OSC commands
  * NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF which are handled like incoming MIDI events
    without triggering their associated actions.
  * CLEAR_INSTRUMENT - to remove all notes of the selected pattern
    associated with the provided instrument number.
  * CLI option:
      * -O/--osc-port to use a custom OSC port in both hydrogen and h2cli.
      * -L/--log-file to provide a path to an alternative log file.
      * -T/--log-timestamps to add timestamps to all log messages.
      * --config to use a different user-level config file.
      * --compression-level for h2cli to set the trade-off between
        max. quality (.mp3 and .ogg)/max. speed (.flac) (0.0) and
        max. compression (1.0) for exported audio files.
      * Adding support for importing and exporting audio files of
        format .mp3, .opus, .au, .caf, .voc, .w64. Drumkits containing
        those formats can be loaded with older versions of Hydrogen too.
        libsndfile >= 1.1.0 is required on your system for MP3 support. (#2023)
      * X-NSM-Exec entry added to org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.desktop
        by @grammoboy2 (#2042).
      * Delete key does now remove selected notes and notes under
        cursor in NotePropertiesRuler.

  Changed

  * Brazilian translation updated.
  * Grid lines in the Song Editor are now rendered dotted to
    emphasize that this is the space the patterns in rather
    than objects in their own right.
  * Virtual keyboard strokes are now mapped exactly as incoming
    MIDI NOTE_ON events (respecting both "Use output note as input note"
    and hihat pressure groups). But do not trigger associated actions (#1770).
  * CLI option -d understand driver names regardless of capitalization.
  * h2cli option -V is now able to handle whitespaces between flag and argument.
  * h2cli long option for -k is renamed --drumkit -> kit in order to
    align the naming with the one used in hydrogen CLI options.
  * Smaller keyboard cursor size with resolution set to off.
  * Rename "J.Master" button into "Timebase".

  Fixed

  * Fix potential segfault on ill-formated notes in .h2song files.
  * Fix buzzing sound during startup when using Port Audio (#1932).
  * Fix build failure without precompiled headers (e.g. on Gentoo) (#1944).
  * Fix persistent of hihat pressure group settings while
    changing/restarting MIDI drivers.
  * Fix mapping of NOTE_OFF MIDI messages in hihat pressure groups.
  * Fix segfault when using MIDI sense button in table of
    Preferences > MIDI after removing rows above it from the table.
  * Fix synchronization problems while using JACK Timebase support (#1953).
  * Fix compilation error on macOS with case-sensitive filesystem (#1938).
  * Fix usability with large QT_SCALE_FACTOR (#1933).
  * Fix MIDI, WAV, and LilyPond export as well as drumkit import
    and export with with non-ASCII filenames (#1957).
  * Paths to songs and scripts are now properly saved relative to
    a .h2playlist file (in case the corresponding option was set).
  * Fix grid line rendering with resolution set to off (#2015).
  * Fix handling of adjacent tags with same content in Director by @aldimond (#2036).
  * Fix copy/cut/paste in PianoRollEditor.

  Removed

  * Windows 32bit support dropped (due to upstream limitations).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    in version 1.3.0

Fixed

  * Restore mute button state of master mixer strip on song load.
  * Recorded MIDI notes were inserted ahead of the beat (#1851).
  * Drumkit Property Dialog:
    * Images were written regardless whether one hits the ok or cancel button.
    * When using Save As to create a new drumkit, the added image was put in the
      old drumkit folder instead and not properly copied into the new one.
    * Allow to Save As drumkits derived from kits not found on the current system.
  * Audio Engine: In Song Mode with Loop Mode deactivated Hydrogen missed notes

    using JACK on Linux (#1902, #1867, #1907)
  * Pattern Editor:
    * Only delete stop notes clicked by the user. (#1859)
    * Proper undo of moving notes out of DrumPatternEditor. (#1859)
    * Custom note lengths are now only drawn till the next stop
      note. (#1859)

    fixed (#1920).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  4 21:19:39 UTC 2024 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Add Fix-driver-switching-whil-using-JACK.patch and
      Fix-JACK-support.patch which fixes crashes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  3 05:47:00 UTC 2024 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Remove fix-obsolete-appdata.patch now upstream
- Set noarch for libhydrogen-core-devel package
- Update to version 1.2.2
Added

  * Hydrogen is now released as AppImage for Linux as well.
  * Playlist dialog can now be resized and remembers geometry,
    position, as well as visibility.
  * Save and restore Director position, geometry, and visibility.
  * New and properly licensed AppStream metainfo files
    org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.metainfo.xml replace old
    org.hydrogenmusic.Hydrogen.appdata.xml.
  * Hydrogen shows an error dialog and exits on the first invocation
    with no hydrogen.conf file present on user and system level
    (application was not properly installed).
  * A new cmake option WANT_DYNAMIC_JACK_CHECK was
    introduced. When set Hydrogen does check on startup whether
    jackd, jackdbus, or pw-jack is installed and disables JACK
    support in case none of them was found. This is intended for
    bundled builds, like AppImage and Flatpak, and can be overridden
    by setting the audio driver manually to "Jack" in the
    hydrogen.conf or by passing the "-d jack" CLI option.

Changed

  * Spanish translation updated.
  * Minor tweaks in French and German translation.
  * On Linux the order of audio drivers tried when selecting Auto
    changed from "JACK > ALSA > OSS > PulseAudio" to
    "JACK > PulseAudio > ALSA > OSS".

Fixed

  * Style combo box in Preferences > Appearance > Interface is
    working again.
  * Fix segfault on hitting "Panic" button while transport was
    rolling.
  * Instrument/strip-specific actions, like MIDI action
    STRIP_MUTE_TOGGLE, did void the instrument selection of the
    Instrument Editor if the specified instrument was not the
    currently selected one.
  * Do not start playback at cursor when cursor in Song Editor is
    beyond the current song length.
  * Fixed compatibility with PortMidi version 217 (Hydrogen v1.2.1
    was incompatible) (#1795). All versions of Hydrogen >=1.3 will,
    however, require on a more recent PortMidi version (at least
    v2.0.1).
  * Fixed allowed range of MIDI output notes to be [0,127] again
    (#1828) (introduced in v1.2.0).
  * Hydrogen does now successfully startup even if no data folder is
    present on user and system level.
  * Allow an arbitrary number of notes in a pattern (#1827).
  * Fix playback track volume fader (#1449)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 25 14:12:20 UTC 2023 - Konstantin Voinov <kv@kott.no-ip.biz>

- Add upstream patch:
  hydrogen-Fix-beat-and-bar-calculation-in-pattern-mode.patch

- Update to version 1.2.0

* General behavior
  - Remembering paths in all export/import/save/open dialogs.
  - Introducing keyboard shortcut for the Open Pattern dialog.
  - Allow for opening more than one Pattern at once.
  - All available audio drivers can now be chosen via CLI.
  - Implement missing EFFECT_LEVEL_RELATIVE MIDI action
  - If the Timeline is activated, the tempo set using the BPM
    widget, BeatCounter, Tap Tempo, or MIDI/OSC commands is used left
    of the first tempo marker.
  - The tempo provided by an external JACK timebase master
    overwrites all internal tempo settings.
  - The BPM widget switches to read-only mode and displays the
    current playback speed when the Timeline is activated.
  - Activation of the Timeline is now stored in each individual
    .h2song file.
  - Autosave files will be hidden. The interval they are stored with
    as well whether there is an autosave at all can be set via the
    Preferences. Hydrogen will inform the user whether there are
    unsaved changes to recover taken from the autosave file.
  - Hydrogen is now able to recover changes applied to a new and
    empty song in case they are discarded or the session end
    untimely (using autosave files)
  - Multiple actions can be assigned to a single MIDI event.
  - The virtual keyboard is now decoupled from the "Hear New Notes"
    button in the Pattern Editor and can be used to play back notes in
    song mode with playback rolling too.
  - Mutable warning dialogs are shown when saving/exporting a
    drumkit containing samples of mismatching license and when
    saving/exporting a drumkit or song containing a copyleft license
    or one requiring an attribution.
  - Drumkit properties dialog does now feature a table listing all
    contained samples and associated licenses.
  - All actions accessible via right-clicking in the SoundLibrary do
    affect the stack drumkits and not the instrument list of the
    current song.
  - All actions accessible via the Drumkits tab of the main menu do
    affect the loaded drumkit using the current song's custom
    instrument and component list.
* Interface
  - Improved scalability (most PNG images were replaced by SVGs,
    hardcoded PNG labels are now directly drawn by Qt, and spin boxes,
    buttons, and combo boxes are now based on native Qt widgets)
  - Improved internationalization (all labels are translatable now
    and support UTF-8)
  - Improved accessibility (widgets were increased to fill available
    space, preference option to (de- and) increase font size)
  - All colors can be altered via the preferences
  - Input widgets (rotary, fader, combo box, spin box, button) do
    support both mouse and keyboard input (e.g. setting numerical values)
  - Input widgets are faintly highlighted when hovered and more
    strongly highlighted when clicked (focuses). Only the focused
    widget can receive keyboard input
  - MIDI-learnable widgets now show their corresponding MIDI action
    and it's binding in the tooltip
  - It's now possible to jump to the beginning of the currently
    playing pattern by clicking its position on the ruler in the
    pattern editor.
  - The length of patterns can now be changed while transport is
    rolling.
* PreferencesDialog > Appearance tab overhaul
  - Drop previous font options in favor for three different
    levels of font (without exposing their point sizes)
  - Ability to decrease or increase the overall font size
  - All settings in the Appearance tab - except the overall layout
    and the scaling policy - take effect immediately (no restart
    required anymore)
  - Drop the "fixed" coloring methods and rename "steps" to
    "Custom".
  - Via a colored button the particular line color can now be
    adjusted using a QColorDialog
  - Custom color tab to alter all colors in the GUI (big thanks to
    the Muse4 team for the original code).
  - All options set in the Appearance tab can be imported and
    exported into and shared via dedicated .h2theme files.
  - Overhauled MIDI Table
    - Per effect or layer setting are now done in dedicated spin
      boxes instead of providing individual actions for each.
    - Only spin boxes for parameters required for a particular
      action are shown.
    - Rows can be removed by unsetting both the Event and Action
      combo box.
  - Clicking the widget showing the status messages does now open a
    dropdown menu displaying the last 100 messages.
* Audio processing
  - Set CoreAudio (macOS) buffer size to control latency
  - New fast exponential ADSR envelope processing
* InstrumentEditor UX improvements:
  - rework start/end/loop frame slider selection and motion.
  - rework velocity/pan envelope editing
* SongEditor UX improvements:
  - Tags can now be inserted at all possible columns
  - Hovering a Tag displays its content
  - Changed behavior of the Tempo Marker dialog: When clicking an
    existing Tempo Marker it can be moved, edited, or
    deleted. Clicking a column with no Tempo Marker present allows
    to create a new one at an arbitrary location.
  - Timeline is deactivated automatically when switching to Pattern
    Mode or a JACK timebase master is present
  - The tempo used left of the first tempo marker is painted in a
    darker color.
  - The currently used Tempo Marker gets highlighted.
  - Tags have been moved into Timeline (next to the Tempo Markers)
    in order to make room to accommodate the cursor in the ruler to
    highlight the current position
  - Tags can be inserted by left-clicking the bottom area of the
    Timeline (above the ruler).
  - Clicking the ruler is now always enabled and automatically
    switches transport into Song Mode.
  - Full-size playhead
  - The icons in the pattern list indicating whether a pattern is
    playing in stacked pattern mode are now colored and can have four
    different states: on, off, off next (pattern is played till the
    end and then turned off), and on next (pattern is played as soon
    as transport is looped again)
  - In song mode the pattern editor can be locked meaning that
    always the bottom-most pattern of the current column the
    playhead resides in as well as all other playing notes are
    shown. Pattern selection is done automatically when moving into
    a different column.
* PatternEditor UX tweaks:
  - Relocating transport by clicking the ruler is now supported
    (like in the SongEditor) and automatically switches transport
    into Pattern Mode.
  - Full-size playhead
  - The ruler was decoupled from the currently selected pattern. It
    always has the size of the largest playing pattern and always
    shows the transport position using a playhead. Whether or not the
    current pattern is played back is indicated by a full-height
    cursor.
  - All note properties except of the note key can now be altered in
    both the drum pattern editor and the piano roll editor by
    right-clicking and dragging a note.
  - All notes of the currently playing patterns will be hinted in
    stacked pattern mode, when selecting a virtual pattern, or in
    case the pattern editor is locked in song mode. Even those notes
    exceeding the length of the current pattern are shown.
* OSC API
  - Add command /Hydrogen/LOAD_DRUMKIT
  - Add command /Hydrogen/UPGRADE_DRUMKIT
  - Add command /Hydrogen/VALIDATE_DRUMKIT
  - Add command /Hydrogen/EXTRACT_DRUMKIT
  - Add command /Hydrogen/BPM
  - /Hydrogen/STRIP_SOLO_TOGGLE/X and /Hydrogen/STRIP_MUTE_TOGGLE/X
    can now be called without any argument too
* H2CLI
  - Add `--upgrade` option to upgrade a drumkit
  - Add `--check` option to validate a drumkit
  - Add `--extract` option to extract the content of a drumkit
  - Drumkit supplied using `-k` option can now be either the name of
    an install kit or an absolute path to a kit (does not have to be
    located in the Hydrogen's drumkit folder).
* Bugfixes
  - fix dithering of SongEditor when viewing the playback track
    and resizing the application or for very small size (#1379).
  - fix rewinding to beginning of pattern in pattern mode with no
    pattern inserted in SongEditor (#932)
  - fix display of tags and tempo marker while loading a song
    (introduced in 1.1.0) (#1393)
  - default MIDI driver is now picked with the system's capabilities
    in mind
  - remove unwanted samples at the end of the exported song (to
    .wav) (#946)
  - fix undefined tempo before first tempo marker (#416)
  - fix Song export to keep writing till all notes and FX have faded
    out
  - notes at first ticks in pattern were missed when relocation
    transport using the position ruler
  - fix playhead glitches when adding toggling patterns at the end
    of the song after transport was loop at least once
  - deactivating loop mode result stopping transport at the end of
    the song even if transport was already looped at least once
  - relocation of the playhead use JACK is now also support in case
    transport is not rolling
  - Hydrogen is now able to handle multiple drumkits featuring the
    same name in the SoundLibrary. The drumkit's absolute path will be
    used as unique handler from now on.
  - Mixing instruments from different drumkit in one Song works
    again
  - Hydrogen shows a now a warning dialog when exporting/saving date
    to read-only folders
  - fix text overflow in Director
* Crash reporting
  - Fatal errors will now show a GUI report including details to report
    and potential hints about the cause
