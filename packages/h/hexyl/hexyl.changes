- Update to version 0.13.0
  * Support both little and big Endian dumps using --endianness={little,big}
  * Breaking: Changed the meaning of the short flag -C to be consistent with hexdump -C. 
    Previously, this would hide the character panel, but now -C shows the character panel, 
    in case it has been previously (e.g. in an alias) disabled with --no-characters

- Update to version 0.11.0
  * Significantly improved performance.
  * Added variable panels through the --panels and --terminal-width
    flags.
  * Added new --group-bytes/-g option.
  * Added new --base B option (where B can be binary, octal,
    decimal or hexadecimal).

    (previously: 0), in order not to confuse them with ASCII.
  * 0 bytes if colors are deactivated.
