%description
hashdeep is a program to compute, match, and audit hashsets.
md5deep computes the MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, or Whirlpool message digest
for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through the
directory structure. md5deep can also match input files against lists of known
hashes in a variety of formats.
