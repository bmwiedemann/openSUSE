  <title>A Yamaha DX7 modeling software synthesizer for DSSI</title>
  <description>Hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation of                                              
a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer.  It can easily load most DX7 patch bank 
files, edit those patches via a built-in editor or MIDI sys-ex                                                          
messages (ALSA systems only), and recreate the sound of the DX7 with 
greater accuracy than any previous open-source emulation (that the 
author is aware of....)                                        

Hexter operates as a plugin for the DSSI Soft Synth Interface. DSSI 
is a plugin API for software instruments (soft synths) with user 
interfaces, permitting them to be hosted in-process by audio 
applications.</description>
