Thu Feb  9 09:53:40 UTC 2023 - Manfred Hollstein <manfred.h@gmx.net>

- CVE-2023-25165: Require helm >= 3.11.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 17:02:57 UTC 2023 - Manfred Hollstein <manfred.h@gmx.net>

- Update to version 0.150.0:
  New features:
  * We introduced a new Helmfile V1 mode that can be enabled via an
    environment variable and a build flag. It allows you to build a
    Helmfile V1 binary from the same source tree and even enabling
    the V1 mode at runtime via an environment variable:
    HELMFILE_V1MODE=true
  * The new V1 mode and upcoming Helmfile v1 releases have some
    breaking changes like the .gotmpl extension is required to let
    Helmfile render the helmfile.yaml as a template. See the V1
    proposal for more information.
  * We also reverted our YAML library to gopkg.in/yaml.v2 and
    introduced goccy/go-yaml for the Helmfile V1 mode. You can
    opt-in for the V1 mode or enable the new YAML library via
    environment variables: HELMFILE_GOCCY_GOYAML=true. Please note
    that the default yaml parser disables yaml overwrite feature.
  * If you've been struggling with managing and repeating common
    fields across releases, or worked-around that by either
    leveraging helmfile templates(not release templates) or
    layering values and valuesTemplate (although it wasn't the
    intended usage), the new inherit field would be handy.
    It allows you to layer any number of release templates.
  * The last and most important change is that we finally dropped
    the Helm v2 support! Helm v2 has been unmaintained since 2020,
    and no one should be using it anymore.

  What's Changed:
  * Clarify postsync hooks docs by @felipecrs in #585
  * optimize lint logic by @yxxhero in #586

- Update to version 0.147.0:
  v0.147.0 is the first Helmfile version to officially support Helm
  3.10.0, along with several fixes and new features.
  Starting from helmfile v0.147.0, helmfile version will check for
  the latest version of Helmfile and print a tip if the current
  version is not the latest. To disable this behavior, set
  environment variable HELMFILE_UPGRADE_NOTICE_DISABLED to any
  non-empty value.

  This minor release incorporates many new features and a few bug
  fixes, almost all thanks to 5 new contributors! Kudos to everyone
  who contributed code 🙏
  Also, we've been fixing a handful of regressions introduced via
  v0.145.0 in v0.145.x patch releases. For this release, the only
  regression we found and fixed was #370. Hopefully, this will be
  the most reliable release ever since v0.145.0!

- Update to version 0.145.5:
  This patch release is mainly for fixing the default --skip-needs
  setting. If you had to add --skip-needs to every helmfile run
  since v0.145.0, this fixes that- you no longer need to explicitly
  set --skip-needs. To be clear, --skip-needs has been the default
  since v0.139.2. We just unintentionally broke it in v0.145.0!
  See #339 for more details. Thanks a lot for filing the detailed
  issue @strainovic, and thanks a lot for fixing the issue @yxxhero!

  few diff-related flags that were not working since v0.145.0's

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 08:23:11 UTC 2021 - Manfred Hollstein <manfred.h@gmx.net>

- v0.139.0
  This release includes a lot of bug fixes for forceNamespace,
  jsonPatches, strategicMergePatches, needs, kustomize integration,
  chartify, and the use of kubeContext in templates. If you use any
  of these features, upgrading to 1.139.x is highly recommended.

  This is a minor version bump because we had a bug fix that
  resulted in breaking some existing behavior. See #1831.

  CAUTION: Your pipeline may start failing due to a fixed bug. See
  #1831 and add --skip-needs to your helmfile command if you'd like
  to opt-in to preserve the existing behaviour.
