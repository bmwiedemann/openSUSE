  v0.147.0 is the first Helmfile version to officially support Helm

  the latest version of Helmfile and print a tip if the current
  version is not the latest. To disable this behavior, set
  environment variable HELMFILE_UPGRADE_NOTICE_DISABLED to any
  non-empty value.

  This minor release incorporates many new features and a few bug
  fixes, almost all thanks to 5 new contributors! Kudos to everyone
  who contributed code 🙏
  Also, we've been fixing a handful of regressions introduced via
  v0.145.0 in v0.145.x patch releases. For this release, the only
  regression we found and fixed was #370. Hopefully, this will be
  the most reliable release ever since v0.145.0!

- Update to version 0.145.5:
  This patch release is mainly for fixing the default --skip-needs
  setting. If you had to add --skip-needs to every helmfile run
  since v0.145.0, this fixes that- you no longer need to explicitly
  set --skip-needs. To be clear, --skip-needs has been the default
  since v0.139.2. We just unintentionally broke it in v0.145.0!
  See #339 for more details. Thanks a lot for filing the detailed
  issue @strainovic, and thanks a lot for fixing the issue @yxxhero!

  few diff-related flags that were not working since v0.145.0's

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 08:23:11 UTC 2021 - Manfred Hollstein <manfred.h@gmx.net>

- v0.139.0
  This release includes a lot of bug fixes for forceNamespace,
  jsonPatches, strategicMergePatches, needs, kustomize integration,
  chartify, and the use of kubeContext in templates. If you use any
  of these features, upgrading to 1.139.x is highly recommended.

  This is a minor version bump because we had a bug fix that
  resulted in breaking some existing behavior. See #1831.

  CAUTION: Your pipeline may start failing due to a fixed bug. See
  #1831 and add --skip-needs to your helmfile command if you'd like
  to opt-in to preserve the existing behaviour.
