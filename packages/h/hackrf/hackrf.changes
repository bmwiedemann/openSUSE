- Update to version 2021.03.01
  Note: You must also update firmware on your HackRF !
  * CPLD bitstreams are now included in and loaded automatically
    by the firmware. There is no longer a need to update the CPLD
    separately.
  * The clock output (CLKOUT) is now turned off by default.
  * A new utility, hackrf_clock, provides a way to inspect and
    modify configuration of hardware clocks, including turning on
    and off CLKOUT.
  * The rad1o badge is now supported by firmware in this release.
    Firmware from the HackRF release/repository is different than
    the original CCCamp firmware and only supports operation as a
    USB SDR peripheral.
  * When using a HackRF One with a PortaPack in "HackRF Mode"
    (operating as a USB peripheral), the PortaPack display now
    indicates operational status and settings.
  * There have been many more enhancements and bug fixes.
