  <title>A virtual machine for Haxe</title>
  <description>HashLink is a virtual machine for Haxe.
Haxe supports two modes of compilation for HashLink:
* Compilation to HashLink bytecode. This mode has a very fast compilation time,
  so it is suitable for daily development.
* Compilation to HashLink/C code, compiled with a native compiler to a regular
  executable. This mode results in the best performance, so it is suitable for
  final releases.
