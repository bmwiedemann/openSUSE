I want to add HashLink ( https://hashlink.haxe.org/ ) to openSUSE:Factory

HashLink is a virtual machine for Haxe.
Haxe supports two modes of compilation for HashLink:
* Compilation to HashLink bytecode. This mode has a very fast compilation time,
so it is suitable for daily development.
* Compilation to HashLink/C code, compiled with a native compiler to a regular
executable. This mode results in the best performance, so it is suitable for
final releases.

    <comment>- Update to version 1.12
  * support for hot reload
  * added native int64 support (for x64 only, compile with -D hl-legacy32 to keep hl32 i64 emulation)
  * added field name to null access exceptions
  * added hl.Api.compact to compact a set of values into a single GC block
  * better stack primitives for faster haxe throw
  * added 16 bits PNG decoding (fmt)
  * added captured stack for closures (when debugger connected)
  * added ftell2/fseek2 for large file support
  * added optional library support @:native(&quot;?lib&quot;,&quot;name&quot;) static function foo() : Void allowing runtime detection of libraries (as well as hl.Api.isPrimLoaded)
  * changed Windows binary to use VS2015 (was VS2013)
