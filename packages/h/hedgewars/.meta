  <title>2D tankbattle game with the tanks replaced by hedgehogs</title>
  <description>Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the &quot;Rope&quot; or &quot;Parachute&quot;, to move to otherwise inaccessible areas.</description>
