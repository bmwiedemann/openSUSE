 * Fix English-only language/country names in language selection
 * Fix very, very broken mission map descriptions

Lua API:
 + New call: SetCinematicMode(enable) -- e.g. for cutscenes etc.
 + New call: GetAmmoName(ammoType [, ignoreOverwrite]) -- returns the localized name for the specified ammoType
 + New call: GetVisualGearType(vgUid) -- returns the visual gear type
 + New call: SetAmmoTexts(ammoType, name, caption, description) -- Overwrite displayed name and description of an ammo type
 + New call: SetAmmoDescriptionAppendix(ammoType, descAppend) -- Append a custom text to the description of an ammo type without overwriting it
 + New call: GetHogFort(gearUid) -- Returns the name of the fort of the hog's team
 + New call: PlaceRubber(x, y, frameIdx) -- Places a rubber
 + New call: SendGameResultOff() -- Disable the game automatically setting a game result in the stats screen
 + New call: SendRankingStatsOff() -- Disable the game automatically filling the team rankings in the stats screen
 + New call: SendAchievementsStatsOff() -- Disable the game automatically populating the bullet point list in the “Details” section on the stats screen
 + New call: GetTeamStats(teamname) -- Returns a table of team stats
 + New call: EndTurn([noTaunts]) -- Ends the current turn
 + New hook: onVisualGearAdd(vgUid) -- called when a visual gear is added
 + New hook: onVisualGearDelete(vgUid) -- called when a visual gear is deleted
 + New hook: onUsedAmmo(ammoType) -- called when ammo has been finished using (e.g. after both shotgun shots)
 + New variable: AirMinesNum -- Number of air mines being placed on a medium-sized map
 + New variable: WorldEdge -- World edge type (weNone, weWrap, weBounce, weSea)
 + New variable: AmmoTypeMax -- Maximum ammo type ID (useful to iterate through all ammo types, starting by 0)
 + New variable: ReadyTimeLeft -- Remaining ready time, 0 if turn in progress. Can be set in onNewTurn
 + Locale library: loc_noop -- Mark string for translation but don't translate it
 + Animate library: AnimInit([startAnimating]) -- New parameter startAnimating: if true, will start game in cinematic mode with most controls disabled. Must play an animation after that
 + Animate library: AnimSetInputMask(extraInputMask) -- Set input mask in a manner comptible with the Animate library
 + Animate library: AnimMove(gear, dir, posx, posy, [maxMoveTime]) -- new optional parameter maxMoveTime. If hog did not reach its destination within maxMoveTime milliseconds, animation stops and hog is just teleported there
 + Gear values: “Boom” -- used to modify explosion size and/or damage for most gears
 + 8 overridable custom sprites/sounds: sprCustom1-sprCustom8, sndCustom1-sndCustom8
 * Fixed call: HideHog(gear) -- Fix crash when gear is invalid. Returns true on success or false otherwise
 * Fixed call: SwitchHog(gear) -- Fix new hog being unable to open ammo menu
 * Removed call: SetAmmoStore -- Old undocumented function of questional use, has never been used
 * Fixed variable: Goals -- Fix Goals text being cut off at ca. 255 characters
 * Fix huge numbers having sign errors on 64-bit architectures
