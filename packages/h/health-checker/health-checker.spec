%description
health-checker is a service running once at every reboot to verify
that all important services are running. If it is the first reboot after
an update, an automatic rollback to the last working snapshot is made.
If this is not after an update, a reboot is made. If this does not help,
the services will be disabled.
This package does not contain any checks. For this, additional
plugins for different products are needed.
