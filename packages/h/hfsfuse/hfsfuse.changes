Tue Feb 17 00:50:31 UTC 2026 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.400
  * This release enables use of the multi-threaded FUSE loop.
    Previously hfsfuse was limited to single-threaded mode.
  * Fixes a potential memory leak on directory open failure.
  * Other minor improvements.
- from version 0.392
  * Fixes an issue building hfsdump in a release configuration.
  * The system's uthash headers can now be used instead of the
    bundled version by building with WITH_UTHASH=system
  * Other minor improvements.
- from version 0.385
  * Fixes handling of file timestamps earlier than 1970.
    Previously these were clamped to the Unix epoch.
  * Fixes an issue with the LZVN install target that caused make
    install-lib to fail. LZVN has also been updated with an uninstall
    target for use with make uninstall-lib.
  * A pkg-config file has been added for libhfsuser and can be
    installed with the make install-lib target. This can be used
    to get the appropriate linker flags including the supporting
    libraries libhfsuser was built with.
  * hfsdump now prints version/build info alongside usage if invoked
    with no arguments.
  * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
- from version 0.358
  * Fixes a bug in the previous release that caused hfsfuse
    not to compile on systems with statx support.
  * Minor improvements to error handling in hfsfuse and hfsdump.
  * Adds hfs_open_volume and hfs_file_read to libhfsuser's API
    to read files without keeping track of offsets and to open
    volumes without explicitly initializing libhfs respectively.
- from version 0.345
  * Embeds the LZVN library as a local dependency, first supported
    for decoding certain HFS+ compressed files in v0.318.
  * LZVN is small and not widely distributed, so was a good candidate
    for embedding locally. This uses a portability-focused fork of the
    LZVN library from 0x09/LZVN.
  * This is built by default and may be configued using
    WITH_LZVN=local/system/none simiar to the existing
    ublio and utf8proc dependencies.
  * The build system no longer overrides the C standard version set by
    embedded libraries to gnu11 and now builds these with the version
    specified by the library. The former was not known to cause any issues.
  * Adds a new high level API for file reading to libhfsuser which offers
    a unified interface for reading HFS+ compressed files and regular files.
    Clients using this no longer need to interface with the hfs_decmpfs_* API
    directly, and this new interface has been adopted in all hfsfuse tools.
  * Various minor Makefile improvements
- from version 0.318
  * Adds support for LZVN HFS+ compression using libFastCompression
    from https://github.com/xerub/LZVN.
  * If this library is not available, the tools will now log a more
    appropriate error when attempting to read these types of files.
    Edit: this library is now embedded since release v0.327
  * hfstar: fixes a double-free of the decmpfs context in case of error.
  * Updates the utf8proc subtree to v0.32.0
- Add no-incompatible-pointer-types.patch to treat compiler
  error for "-Wincompatible-pointer-types" as warning only

Wed Dec 24 11:16:06 UTC 2025 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- Update to 0.310:
  * add support for the statx FUSE operation in libfuse 3.18+,
    which enables printing file and directory birth times in the
    output of the stat command on Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 10 09:16:59 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.307
  * macOS: Updates hfsfuse to work with the current version of macFUSE (5.1.x).
  * Updates the embedded utf8proc to version 2.11.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 26 14:22:47 UTC 2025 - John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <adrian.glaubitz@suse.com>

- Update to 0.292
  * Adds support for the FUSE version 3 API. If available this
    will be detected and used at build time. hfsfuse remains
    compatible with FUSE version 2 implementations if v3 is
    not available. (bsc#1243039)
- Add missing license information for vendored libraries
- Pass WITH_UBILIO=local WITH_UTF8PROC=system to %make_install
