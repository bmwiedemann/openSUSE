%description
FUSE driver for HFS+ filesystems, based on NetBSD's kernel driver with modifications.

hfsfuse embeds and extends NetBSD's HFS+ kernel driver into a portable library for use
with FUSE and other userspace tools. hfsfuse was created for use on FreeBSD and other
Unix-like systems that lack a native HFS+ driver, but can also be used on Linux and
macOS as an alternative to their kernel drivers.

hfsfuse also includes two standalone tools, hfsdump and hfstar, which can be used
without FUSE.

This driver is read-only and cannot write to or alter the target filesystem.

Supported

 * Journaled and non-journaled HFS+
 * Unicode normalization for pathnames via utf8proc
 * Hard links, including directory hard links (i.e. Time Machine backups)
 * Resource fork, Finder info, and creation/backup time access via extended attributes
 * birthtime (with compatible FUSE)
 * User-defined extended attributes
 * HFS+ compression with zlib and lzfse

Not supported

 * HFS without the "+", aka "Mac OS Standard" volumes. For these, try hfsutils.
 * Writing
