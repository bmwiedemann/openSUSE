Sun Nov  1 21:25:19 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.0:
  * When an application fails to focus itself (because
    focus_stealing_prevention is active), then the window is marked
    as urgent.
  * New optional argument for the 'split' command for splitting
    non-leaf frames
  * Frame objects: the frame layout can be introspected via the
    'tiling' object present in each tag, e.g.: 'tags.focus.tiling'.
  * New command 'foreach' for iterating over objects
  * New attribute 'urgent_count' for tags, counting the number of
    urgent clients on a tag
  * New rule consequence 'floatplacement' that updates the placement
    of floating clients ('floatplacement=smart' for little overlap,
    'floatplacement=center' for centering) or leaves the floating
    position as is ('floatplacement=none')
  * New rule condition 'pgid'
  * New format specifier '%c' in the 'sprintf' command (useful
    in combination with 'foreach')
  * The 'new_attr' command now also accepts an initial value
  * React to a change of the 'floating_focused' attribute of the
    tag object
  * New frame index character 'p' for accessing the parent frame
  * Object tree documentation as a json file
  Bug fixes:
  * Fix wrong behaviour in 'cycle_layout' in the case where the
    current layout is not contained in the layout list passed
    to 'cycle_layout'.
  * Fix handling of delta -1 in 'focus_monitor' and 'cycle_monitor'
  * Fixed precision decimals in the layout tree (more reliable
    in- and output of fractions in frame splits)
  * Fixes in maximize.sh

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  8 07:56:04 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.3:
  * Set .desktop file Type to Application (#903) 
  * Ignore EnterNotify events by grabs and decoration (#907) 
  * Don't drop later EnterNotify during enternotify() (#909) 
  * Consistently use $(BUILDDIR) in Makefile
  * Remove unused command interface methods (#917) 
  * Update and add new tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  5 07:17:51 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.2:
  * Selection of empty frames by the mouse (by click or by hover if
    focus_follows_mouse is enabled)
  * The commands 'close_and_remove' / 'close_or_remove' act like
    'close' for floating clients
  * The decoration window allows focusing, moving, and resizing
    the client via the mouse (as known from standard floating
    window managers)
  * Improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  * Fix a crash in the error handler when a invalid monitor
    name is passed. (Affects list_padding move_monitor
    rename_monitor lock_tag unlock_tag)
  * Fix the type of WM_STATE
  * The client attributes sizehints_tiling and sizehints_floating
    are now writable
  * Fix EWMH urgency change for clients without WM hints set
  * Fix the exit code of the 'focus' command

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 21 06:23:38 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.1:
  * the frame index 'e' refers to the first empty frame
    (e.g. 'rule index=e' places new windows in empty frames, if possible)
  * new setting 'hide_covered_windows' to improve the appearance
    when used with a compositor.
  * resize floating windows with the same command ('resize') as in
    tiling mode and thus the same keybindings as in tiling mode.
    Therefore, the 'fractiondelta' parameter to the 'resize' command
    is now optional.
  * keybind now checks that the bound command exists.
  * cycle_all (Alt-Tab) now also traverses floating clients
  * new setting 'auto_detect_panels' controlling the panel
    detection algorithm.
  * improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  Bug fixes:
  * Handle the regular expression "" correctly, since the grammar
    of extended regular expressions does not allow "".
  * Error handling for the lack of xrandr
  * Fixes to make it compile on other systems and architecture

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 12 20:45:28 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.0:
  * single window floating (every client has an attribute 'floating' which can
    be set at run time and via the rule consequence 'floating=on')
  * monitor detection via xrandr
  * detection of external panels
  * new command: apply_rules
  * new command: export (convenience wrapper around setenv)
  * new client attribute: keys_inactive (negation of keymask)
  * new command: drag (initiates moving/resizing a window by mouse)
  * if tags have been configured through EWMH before herbstluftwm starts (from
    a previous running window manager), then herbstluftwm re-uses these tags
    (start with --no-tag-import to disable this)
  * The build system is now cmake. See the INSTALL file if you need to
    compile herbstluftwm yourself.
  * the 'remove' command now tries to preserve the focus and the client
    arrangement. Intuitively speaking, 'remove' is undoing a frame split.
  * Many boolean style settings were formerly of type int. Now, these are
    boolean settings.
  * The 'toggle' command only works for boolean settings. For the former
    behavior for int-typed settings, use 'cycle_value'.
  * Writing '%%' in the 'sprintf' format string now gives a literate '%', just
    as printf. Formerly it stayed '%%'.
  * The 'keybind' command now accepts all valid key symbols, even if they are
    not present on the current keyboard layout at the time of setup.
  * the rules are also applied to those clients that change their WM_CLASS
    after being shown already.
  * 'detect_monitors' has an additional '--list-all' parameter
  * do not change the focus (for focus_follows_mouse=1) when an unmanaged
    dialog (e.g. a rofi menu or a notification) closes.
  * list_rules now prints regex-based rule conditions with '~' instead of '='
  * new attributes on every monitor for pad_up pad_down pad_left pad_right
  * new flag --exit-on-xerror (to be used in automated testing only)
  * Formerly, double dots in object paths were allowed (similar to double
    slashes in file paths in unix). Right now, they are only allowed at the end
    (which is necessary for the tab-completion of attr):
    - +monitors+ is valid
    - +monitors.+ is valid
    - +monitors..+ is valid
    - +monitors.by-name.+ is valid
    - +monitors..by-name.+ is *invalid*
- Remove examples-remove-executable-bits.patch
- Run spec-cleaner

Wed May 29 07:19:37 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.7.2:
  * When herbstluftwm is not running and herbstclient is called,
    the absent herbstluftwm is detected instead of hanging forever.

    via ewmh panels work.
  * Fix return code of remove_attr
  * Fix error when unmanaging clients
  * Some typo fixes in the documentation
