Tue May  5 07:17:51 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.2:
  * Selection of empty frames by the mouse (by click or by hover if
    focus_follows_mouse is enabled)
  * The commands 'close_and_remove' / 'close_or_remove' act like
    'close' for floating clients
  * The decoration window allows focusing, moving, and resizing
    the client via the mouse (as known from standard floating
    window managers)
  * Improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  * Fix a crash in the error handler when a invalid monitor
    name is passed. (Affects list_padding move_monitor
    rename_monitor lock_tag unlock_tag)
  * Fix the type of WM_STATE
  * The client attributes sizehints_tiling and sizehints_floating
    are now writable
  * Fix EWMH urgency change for clients without WM hints set
  * Fix the exit code of the 'focus' command

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 21 06:23:38 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.1:
  * the frame index 'e' refers to the first empty frame
    (e.g. 'rule index=e' places new windows in empty frames, if possible)
  * new setting 'hide_covered_windows' to improve the appearance
    when used with a compositor.
  * resize floating windows with the same command ('resize') as in
    tiling mode and thus the same keybindings as in tiling mode.
    Therefore, the 'fractiondelta' parameter to the 'resize' command
    is now optional.
  * keybind now checks that the bound command exists.
  * cycle_all (Alt-Tab) now also traverses floating clients
  * new setting 'auto_detect_panels' controlling the panel
    detection algorithm.
  * improved herbstclient tab completion for the fish shell
  Bug fixes:
  * Handle the regular expression "" correctly, since the grammar
    of extended regular expressions does not allow "".
  * Error handling for the lack of xrandr
  * Fixes to make it compile on other systems and architecture

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 12 20:45:28 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.0:
  * single window floating (every client has an attribute 'floating' which can
    be set at run time and via the rule consequence 'floating=on')
  * monitor detection via xrandr
  * detection of external panels
  * new command: apply_rules
  * new command: export (convenience wrapper around setenv)
  * new client attribute: keys_inactive (negation of keymask)
  * new command: drag (initiates moving/resizing a window by mouse)
  * if tags have been configured through EWMH before herbstluftwm starts (from
    a previous running window manager), then herbstluftwm re-uses these tags
    (start with --no-tag-import to disable this)
  * The build system is now cmake. See the INSTALL file if you need to
    compile herbstluftwm yourself.
  * the 'remove' command now tries to preserve the focus and the client
    arrangement. Intuitively speaking, 'remove' is undoing a frame split.
  * Many boolean style settings were formerly of type int. Now, these are
    boolean settings.
  * The 'toggle' command only works for boolean settings. For the former
    behavior for int-typed settings, use 'cycle_value'.
  * Writing '%%' in the 'sprintf' format string now gives a literate '%', just
    as printf. Formerly it stayed '%%'.
  * The 'keybind' command now accepts all valid key symbols, even if they are
    not present on the current keyboard layout at the time of setup.
  * the rules are also applied to those clients that change their WM_CLASS
    after being shown already.
  * 'detect_monitors' has an additional '--list-all' parameter
  * do not change the focus (for focus_follows_mouse=1) when an unmanaged
    dialog (e.g. a rofi menu or a notification) closes.
  * list_rules now prints regex-based rule conditions with '~' instead of '='
  * new attributes on every monitor for pad_up pad_down pad_left pad_right
  * new flag --exit-on-xerror (to be used in automated testing only)
  * Formerly, double dots in object paths were allowed (similar to double
    slashes in file paths in unix). Right now, they are only allowed at the end
    (which is necessary for the tab-completion of attr):
    - +monitors+ is valid
    - +monitors.+ is valid
    - +monitors..+ is valid
    - +monitors.by-name.+ is valid
    - +monitors..by-name.+ is *invalid*
- Remove examples-remove-executable-bits.patch
- Run spec-cleaner

- Update to 0.7.2:
  * When herbstluftwm is not running and herbstclient is called,
