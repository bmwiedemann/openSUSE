  <title>A secure webserver for Unix</title>
  <description>Hiawatha is a secure webserver for Unix. It has been written with 'being
secure' as its main goal. Hiawatha has many security features that no other
webserver has. This and the fact that Hiawatha's source code is free of
security-bugs, makes Hiawatha the most secure webserver available.
