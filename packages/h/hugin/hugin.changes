Sun Jul 14 16:12:38 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- update to version 2019.0.0
  * Added raw import: It converts the RAW images to TIFF using a
    raw converter. This can be done by dcraw (requires additional
    exiftool), RawTherapee or darktable. These programs needs to be
    installed externally.
  * Fixes for align_image_stack with EXR images.
  * Added option for range compression. Can be helpful for LDR
    panoramas to brighten the shadows before merging, because at this
    stage the blender has some more information which can be helpful.
  * New hotkeys for mask editor (change zoom level with 0, 1 and 2).
  * Expression parser (pto_var and "manipulate image variables" in
    GUI) can now read also all image variables.
  * line_find: Ignore lines with low distance to each other to get
    better coverage. Also use only central part of the panorama for
    searching for line control points (ignoring zenit/nadir near areas).
  * pano_modify: Added new switch --projection-parameter to set
    projection parameters.
  * Store program settings according to XDG base dir specification
    (Linux only, needs to compile with wxWidgets 3.1.1 or later).
- Enable parallel build, use memory-constraints
- Replace hugin-exiv2-0.27.patch with upstream patch,
  0001-Unified-inclusion-of-exiv2-library-1828925.patch
- Cleanup spec file:
  * Drop obsolete SDL and freeglut BuildRequires
  * Remove obsolete references to SVN (hugin uses mercurial)
  * Minor cleanups, remove obsolete comments etc.

Tue Feb  6 08:16:56 UTC 2018 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 2018.0.0
  The version 2018.0 is mainly a bug fix release and introduce some minor new features.

  Several improvements for optimizer tabs:
  * mark deselected images
  * allow changing optimizer variables for all selected images at once
  * option to ignore line cp
  * hugin_stacker: New tool to stack overlapping images with several
    averaging modes (e.g. mean, median).
  * Hugin: Added option to disable auto-rotation of images in control
    point and mask editor.
  * Nona, verdandi and hugin_stacker can now write BigTIFF images
  * Added expression parser to GUI: This allows to manipulate several
    image variables at once. (This is the same as running pto_var
    --set from the command line.) This can be used e.g. to prealigns
    the images in a given setup and then run cpfind --prealigned to
    search control points only in overlapping images.
  * Add user-defined assistant and expose it in the GUI. It allows
    to set up different assistant strategies without the need to
    recompiling. Provide also some examples (scanned images,
    multi-row panoramas with orphaned images, single-shot panorama
    cameras).
- drop python dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  1 09:37:01 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 18 12:41:12 UTC 2016 - salsergey@gmail.com

- Updated to version 2016.2.0
  * Allow reading of image positions from Papywizard XML files: First add the image to a new project and then select File, Import settings from Papywizard XML file... This will read the lens settings, the image positions and also, if applicable, the bracket settings. After this, the usual workflow is to run cpfind with --prealigned switch and then geocpset to connect orphanded images.
  * The internal blender and verdandi got the possibility to blend seams as alternative to current hard seam: For each seam the color of second image is adapted to the match the color of the first seam. For this blender, the blender order changes according to the overlap. The blending starts with the exposure anchor and blends then all overlapping images. This blending mode is not suited if there are bigger misalignments or bigger parallax errors.
  * The display of the control point error (after optimizing and in fast preview window) and the control point list window can now limited to take only control points in active images into account (menu Edit, Optimize only active images, connected with the setting on the optimizer tab).
  * Improvements to mask tab in Hugin (edit crop of all images of the same lens at once) and find panorama dialog in PTBatcherGUI (remove images from found panoramas, split found panorama into two).
  * Fixes several issues with fast preview window which could result in random crashes (uninitialized variables, memory leaks).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 28 19:36:41 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Build with wxWidgets 3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 14:13:31 UTC 2016 - salsergey@gmail.com

- Updated to version 2016.0.0
  * Added user defined output. The user can define own output sequences to implement new use cases, e.g. zero noise output.
  * Added --clip-exposure switch to nona to automatically mask over and under exposed areas in input images.
  * Color management
    ** GUI tools (Hugin, calibrate_lens_gui) take ICC profiles in files and monitor color profile into account to display images.
    ** celeste and cpfind converts internal image to sRGB before working.
  * Some buttons got a context menu for easier access to some function
    ** Show all in fast preview window to allow better interaction with stacked projects
    ** Celeste in cp tab: the button can now create cp or clean cp  
  * Updated internal levmar library to version 2.6
  * The identify tool in the fast preview window shows now also the image numbers on top of the images. (This can be suppressed by pressing the alt button).
  * Fixes internal image format for GPU remapping. This should fix the "unsupported framebufferformat" error.
  * Use own code for OpenGL intialization. Now freeglut is not needed anymore. (This should prevent the appearing of window when running "nona -g". Linux/Window only)
  * Control point and mask editor retain viewpoint when changing zoom factor.
  * PTBatcherGUI: Minimize to tray is now user configurable.
  * Fixes a bug in photometric optimizer and merge projects with line control points.
- Hugin is built in "build" subdirectory (in-source builds are not allowed now).

  * The fast preview window has a new tool to add or remove control points to selected areas in the output projection.
  * Automatic exposure stack detection is now applied when loading images, and an option has been added to unlink image position when adding stacks.
  * The fine-tune and auto-estimate functions in the control point tab have been made projection aware.
  * PTBatcherGUI has more choice for the end of the process: depending on the operating system the PTBatcherGUI can be closed, the computer can be shut down or send to the hibernate mode.
  * PTBatcherGUI now shows the thumbnails when searching for images in directories.
  * Many of the underlying tools in hugin are now able to use available cpu cores.
