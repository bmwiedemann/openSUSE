  <title>Toolchain for Stitching of Images and Creating Panoramas</title>
  <description>Hugin can be used to stitch multiple images together. The resulting
image can span 360 degrees. Another common use is the creation of very
high resolution pictures by combining multiple images.

Other tools in this package can correct lens distortion, vignetting and
chromatic abberation, create HDR images, provide automatic feature
detection and extraction of key points.</description>
