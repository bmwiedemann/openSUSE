Subject: [PATCH 130/130] README.rst: Add a section about UUID changing

The auto-blacklisting issue has been figured out by now
(https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster-shell-extension/issues/324),
It was caused by our non-integer "version" tag in metadata.json,
plus the fact that two version of the "contact@projecthamster.org"
extension had been uploaded to extensions.gnome.org, but were never
approved by a reviewer, plus the "extension auto-upgrade" feature
of GNOME shell 3.36.

Nevertheless, being able to change the UUID may be useful in the
future.

+Changing the extension UUID
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's possible to change the "UUID" of the extension from
+``contact@projecthamster.org`` to a name of your choice. If you do this,
+you have to obey the `UUID Guidelines
+<https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Extensions/UUIDGuidelines>`.
+This may become necessary in some cases if there are problems with the
+official UUID on `https://extensions.gnome.org`.
+
+To change the UUID, pass it to ``make dist`` in the instructions above::
+
+    # Build
+    make dist UUID="my_uuid@my.domain"
+
+The rest of the build procedure is like above, except that you have to replace
+``contact@projecthamster.org`` by your new UUID everywhere.
