- Update to 0.7.0:
  Added:
  * Added offline support with the account sync command to synchronize
    a backend to a local Maildir backend [#342].
  * Added the flag --disable-cache to not use the local Maildir backend.

  Changed:
  * Made commands read, attachments, flags, copy, move,
    delete accept multiple ids.
  * Flipped arguments ids and folder for commands copy and move
    in order the folder not to be considered as an id.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed missing folder aliases [#430].
  Removed:
  * Removed the -a|--attachment argument from write, reply and
    forward commands. Instead you can attach documents directly from
    the template using the syntax <#part filename=/path/to/you/document.ext>.
  * Removed the -e|--encrypt flag from write, reply and forward
    commands. Instead you can encrypt and sign parts directly from the
    template using the syntax <#part type=text/plain encrypt=command
    sign=command>Hello!<#/part>.
  * Removed the -l|--log-level option, use instead the RUST_LOG
    environment variable (see the wiki)

- Update to 0.6.1:
  Added:
  * Added -s|--sanitize flag for the read command.
  Changed:
  * Changed the behaviour of the -t|--mime-type argument of the read
    command. It is less strict now: if no part is found for the given
    MIME type, it will fallback to the other one. For example, giving
    -t html will show in priority HTML parts, but if none of them are
    found it will show plain parts instead (and vice versa).
  * Sanitization is not done by default when using the read command,
    the flag -s|--sanitize needs to be explicitly provided.
  FixedL
  * Fixed empty text bodies when reading html part on plain text email
    [#352].
