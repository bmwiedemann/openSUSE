Mon May  1 08:09:33 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.2:
  Added:
  * Added create and delete folder commands [sourcehut#54].
  * Added generated completions and man pages to releases
    [sourcehut#43].
  * Added new account config option sync-folders-strategy which allows
    to choose a folders synchronization strategy [sourcehut#59]:
    + sync-folders-strategy = "all": synchronize all existing folders
      for the current account
    + sync-folders-strategy.include = ["folder1", "folder2", …]:
      synchronize only the given folders for the current account
    + sync-folders-strategy.exclude = ["folder1", "folder2", …]:
      synchronizes all folders except the given ones for the current
      account
  * Also added new account sync arguments that override the account
    config option:
    + -A|--all-folders: include all folders to the synchronization.
    + -F|--include-folder: include given folders to the
      synchronization. They can be repeated -F folder1 folder2 or -F folder1 -F folder2.
    + -x|--exclude-folder: exclude given folders from the
      synchronization. They can be repeated -x folder1 folder2 or -x folder1 -F folder2.
  * Added cargo features native-tls (default), rustls-tls and
    rustls-native-certs.
  Changed:
  * Made global options truly global, which means they can be used
    everywhere (not only before commands but also after) [sourcehut#60].
  * Replaced reply all -a argument with -A because it conflicted
    with the global option -a|--account.
  * Replaced himalaya-lib by pimalaya-email.
  * Renamed feature vendored to native-tls-vendored.
  * Removed the develop branch, all the development is now done on the
    master branch.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed config deserialization issue with email-hooks and email-reading-format.
  * Fixed flags case sensitivity.

Wed Feb  8 15:41:34 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.0:
  Added:
  * Added offline support with the account sync command to synchronize
    a backend to a local Maildir backend [#342].
  * Added the flag --disable-cache to not use the local Maildir backend.
  * Added the email composer (from its own repository) [#341].
  * Added Musl builds to releases [#356].
  * Added himalaya man command to generate man page [#419].
  Changed:
  * Made commands read, attachments, flags, copy, move,
    delete accept multiple ids.
  * Flipped arguments ids and folder for commands copy and move
    in order the folder not to be considered as an id.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed missing folder aliases [#430].
  Removed:
  * Removed the -a|--attachment argument from write, reply and
    forward commands. Instead you can attach documents directly from
    the template using the syntax <#part filename=/path/to/you/document.ext>.
  * Removed the -e|--encrypt flag from write, reply and forward
    commands. Instead you can encrypt and sign parts directly from the
    template using the syntax <#part type=text/plain encrypt=command
    sign=command>Hello!<#/part>.
  * Removed the -l|--log-level option, use instead the RUST_LOG
    environment variable (see the wiki)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 12 15:17:26 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.1:
  Added:
  * Added -s|--sanitize flag for the read command.
  Changed:
  * Changed the behaviour of the -t|--mime-type argument of the read
    command. It is less strict now: if no part is found for the given
    MIME type, it will fallback to the other one. For example, giving
    -t html will show in priority HTML parts, but if none of them are
    found it will show plain parts instead (and vice versa).
  * Sanitization is not done by default when using the read command,
    the flag -s|--sanitize needs to be explicitly provided.
  FixedL
  * Fixed empty text bodies when reading html part on plain text email
    [#352].
