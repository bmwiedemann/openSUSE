- Update to 0.6.1:
  Added:
  * Added -s|--sanitize flag for the read command.
  Changed:
  * Changed the behaviour of the -t|--mime-type argument of the read
    command. It is less strict now: if no part is found for the given
    MIME type, it will fallback to the other one. For example, giving
    -t html will show in priority HTML parts, but if none of them are
    found it will show plain parts instead (and vice versa).
  * Sanitization is not done by default when using the read command,
    the flag -s|--sanitize needs to be explicitly provided.
  FixedL
  * Fixed empty text bodies when reading html part on plain text email
    [#352].
