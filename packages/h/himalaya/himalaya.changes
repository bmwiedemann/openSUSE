Fri Jun  9 13:14:42 UTC 2023 - Gus Kenion <gkenion@suse.com>

- Update to 0.8.0:
  Added:
  * Added keyring support, which means Himalaya can now use your system's global keyring to get/set sensitive data like passwords or tokens.
  * Added required IMAP option imap-auth and SMTP option smtp-auth. Possible values: passwd, oauth2.
  * Added OAuth 2.0 support for IMAP and SMTP.
  * Added passwords and OAuth 2.0 configuration via the wizard.
  * Added email-sending-save-copy option to control whenever a copy of any sent email should be saved in the sent folder defined in folder-aliases.
  * Imported id mapper from the lib, which means that the id mapping is now done by the CLI.
  * Added BackendConfig to AccountConfig::backend to match sender implementation.
  * Added support for pipeline commands, which means commands can be either a single command (string) or piped commands (list of strings). It applies for:
    + email-writing-verify-cmd
    + email-writing-decrypt-cmd
    + email-writing-sign-cmd
    + email-writing-encrypt-cmd
  Changed:
  * Changed release archive extensions from .tar.gz to .tgz.
  * Moved wizard module into domains (config, account, backend…).
  * [BREAKING] Changed the way secrets are managed. A secret is a sensitive data like passwords or tokens. There is 3 possible ways to declare a secret in the config file:
    + { raw = <secret> } for the raw secret as string (unsafe, not recommanded),
    + { cmd = <secret-cmd> } for command that exposes the secret,
    + { keyring = <secret-entry> } for entry in your system's global keyring that contains the secret.
    This applies for:
    + imap-passwd
    + imap-oauth2-client-secret
    + imap-oauth2-access-token
    + imap-oauth2-refresh-token
    + smtp-passwd
    + smtp-oauth2-client-secret
    + smtp-oauth2-access-token
    + smtp-oauth2-refresh-token
  Fixed:
  * Fixed Windows releases corrupted archives.
  Removed
  * [BREAKING] Removed -s|--sanitize option. It is done by default now, except if the -t|--mime-type html is set.
  * [BREAKING] Removed native-tls support, rustls-tls is now the only TLS provider available. Removed in consequence native-tls, rustls-tls and rustls-native-certs cargo features.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Added:
  * Added create and delete folder commands [sourcehut#54].
  * Added generated completions and man pages to releases
    [sourcehut#43].
  * Added new account config option sync-folders-strategy which allows
    to choose a folders synchronization strategy [sourcehut#59]:
    + sync-folders-strategy = "all": synchronize all existing folders
      for the current account
    + sync-folders-strategy.include = ["folder1", "folder2", …]:
      synchronize only the given folders for the current account
    + sync-folders-strategy.exclude = ["folder1", "folder2", …]:
      synchronizes all folders except the given ones for the current
      account
  * Also added new account sync arguments that override the account
    config option:
    + -A|--all-folders: include all folders to the synchronization.
    + -F|--include-folder: include given folders to the
      synchronization. They can be repeated -F folder1 folder2 or -F folder1 -F folder2.
    + -x|--exclude-folder: exclude given folders from the
      synchronization. They can be repeated -x folder1 folder2 or -x folder1 -F folder2.
  * Added cargo features native-tls (default), rustls-tls and
    rustls-native-certs.
  Changed:
  * Made global options truly global, which means they can be used
    everywhere (not only before commands but also after) [sourcehut#60].
  * Replaced reply all -a argument with -A because it conflicted
    with the global option -a|--account.
  * Replaced himalaya-lib by pimalaya-email.
  * Renamed feature vendored to native-tls-vendored.
  * Removed the develop branch, all the development is now done on the

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  8 15:41:34 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.0:
  Added:
  * Added offline support with the account sync command to synchronize
    a backend to a local Maildir backend [#342].
  * Added the flag --disable-cache to not use the local Maildir backend.
  * Added the email composer (from its own repository) [#341].
  * Added Musl builds to releases [#356].
  * Added himalaya man command to generate man page [#419].
  Changed:
  * Made commands read, attachments, flags, copy, move,
    delete accept multiple ids.
  * Flipped arguments ids and folder for commands copy and move
    in order the folder not to be considered as an id.
  Fixed:
  * Fixed missing folder aliases [#430].
  Removed:
  * Removed the -a|--attachment argument from write, reply and
    forward commands. Instead you can attach documents directly from
    the template using the syntax <#part filename=/path/to/you/document.ext>.
  * Removed the -e|--encrypt flag from write, reply and forward
    commands. Instead you can encrypt and sign parts directly from the
    template using the syntax <#part type=text/plain encrypt=command
    sign=command>Hello!<#/part>.
  * Removed the -l|--log-level option, use instead the RUST_LOG
    environment variable (see the wiki)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 12 15:17:26 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.1:
  Added:
  * Added -s|--sanitize flag for the read command.
  Changed:
  * Changed the behaviour of the -t|--mime-type argument of the read
    command. It is less strict now: if no part is found for the given
    MIME type, it will fallback to the other one. For example, giving
    -t html will show in priority HTML parts, but if none of them are
    found it will show plain parts instead (and vice versa).
  * Sanitization is not done by default when using the read command,
    the flag -s|--sanitize needs to be explicitly provided.
  FixedL
  * Fixed empty text bodies when reading html part on plain text email
    [#352].
