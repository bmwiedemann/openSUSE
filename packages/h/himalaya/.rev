  * Fixed windows releases due to cargo deps typo.

- Update to 0.8.3:
  * Fix windows releases due to coredump crate compilation error.
  * Fix macos releases due to macos 12 System Integrity Protection.

  Changed:
  * Made the code async using the tokio async runtime.
  * On Linux, made the kernel keyring the default one (the one based on keyutils).
  Fixed:
  * Fixed the way folder aliases are resolved. In some case, aliases were
    resolved CLI side and lib side, which led to alias errors sourcehut#95.

  Added:
  * Implemented OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow for IMAP and SMTP,
    which means that access tokens are now automatically refreshed
    and is transparent for users.
  * Added imap-oauth2-redirect-host and smtp-oauth2-redirect-host
    options to customize the redirect server host name (default: localhost).
  * Added imap-oauth2-redirect-port and smtp-oauth2-redirect-port
    options to customize the redirect server port (default: 9999).
  * Added email-listing-datetime-fmt to customize envelopes datetime
    format. See format spec here.
  * Added email-listing-local-datetime to transform envelopes datetime's
    timezone to the user's local one. For example, if the user's local
    is set to UTC, the envelope date 2023-06-15T09:00:00+02:00
    becomes 2023-06-15T07:00:00-00:00.</comment>
