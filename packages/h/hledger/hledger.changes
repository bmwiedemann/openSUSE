Sun Jan 31 13:49:09 UTC 2021 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hledger to version 1.20.4.
  # 1.20.4 2021-01-29

  - aregister: ignore a depth limit, as in 1.19 (#1468).
    In 1.20-1.20.3, aregister had stopped showing transactions in subaccounts
    below a depth limit. Now it properly shows all subaccount transactions,
    ensuring that the register's final total matches a balance report with
    similar arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 15 08:54:56 UTC 2021 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hledger to version 1.20.3.
  # 1.20.3 2021-01-14

  - When searching for price chains during valuation/currency conversion:

    - It no longer hangs when there are price loops. (And in case of
      future bugs, it will give up rather than search forever.) (#1439)
    - It now really finds the shortest path. (#1443)
    - Useful progress info is displayed with `--debug=1` or `--debug=2`.

  - balance, incomestatement: End-valued multi-period balance change
    reports (eg: `bal -MV`) have been reverted to show value-of-change,
    as in previous hledger versions, rather than change-of-value, for
    now. (#1353, #1428) (Stephen Morgan)

  - balance: End-valued balance change reports now choose the same final
    valuation date and show consistent results whether single-period or
    multi-period. (#1424) (Stephen Morgan)

  - balance: the `--drop` option now works with `csv` and `html` output.
    (#1456) (Ilya Konovalov)

  - check: the `commodities` check, and `-s`/`--strict` mode, now ignore
    the "AUTO" internal pseudo-commodity. (#1419) (Ilya Konovalov)

  - register: Then-valued multi-period register reports
    (eg: `register -M --value=then`) now calculate the correct values.
    (#1449) (Stephen Morgan)

  - roi: now shows a better error message when required prices are
    missing. (#1446) (Dmitry Astapov)

  - The no-symbol commodity's input number format can now be set by a
    `commodity` directive, like other commodities. (#1461)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 29 21:16:52 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

  a non-trivial way, i.e. they did more than just add a new entry
  at the top. You can review the file at:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger-1.20.1/src/CHANGES.md

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  6 13:36:27 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hledger to version 1.20.
  # 1.20 2020-12-05

  ## general

  - strict mode: with -s/--strict, hledger requires that
    all accounts and commodities are declared with directives.

  - Reverted a stripAnsi change in 1.19.1 that caused a 3x slowdown of amount rendering
    in terminal reports. (#1350)

  - Amount and table rendering has been improved, so that stripAnsi is no longer needed.
    This speeds up amount rendering in the terminal, speeding up some reports by 10% or more since 1.19.
    (Stephen Morgan)

  - Amount eliding no longer displays corrupted ANSI codes (#1352, Stephen Morgan)

  - Eliding of multicommodity amounts now makes better use of available space,
    avoiding unnecessary eliding (showing as many amounts as possible within
    32 characters). (Stephen Morgan)

  - Command line help for --no-elide now mentions that it also disables eliding of
    multicommodity amounts.

  - Query terms containing quotes (eg to match account names containing quotes)
    now work properly. (#1368, Stephen Morgan)

  - cli, journal: Date range parsing is more robust, fixing failing/incorrect cases such as: (Stephen Morgan)

    - a hyphenated range with just years (`2017-2018`)
    - a hyphenated date with no day in a hyphenated range (`2017-07-2018`)
    - a dotted date with no day in a dotted range (`2017.07..2018.02`)

  - Debug output is prettier (eg, in colour), using pretty-simple instead of pretty-show.

  - csv, timedot, timeclock files now respect command line --alias options,
    like journal files.  (#859)

  - Market price lookup for value reports is now more robust, fixing several bugs
    (and debug output is more informative).
    There has been a slight change in functionality: when chaining prices,
    we now prefer chains of all "forward" prices, even if longer, with chains
    involving reverse prices being the last resort.
    (#1402)

  ## commands

  - add: number style (eg thousands separators) no longer disturbs the value
    that is offered as default. (#1378)

  - bal: --invert now affects -S/--sort-amount, reversing the order. (#1283, #1379) (Stephen Morgan)

  - bal: --budget reports no longer insert an extra space inside the brackets. (Stephen Morgan)

  - bal, is, bs --change:
    Valued multiperiod balance change reports now show changes of value,
    rather than the value of changes. (#1353, Stephen Morgan)

  - bal: improve budget, MultiBalanceReport debug output
    Comply with debug levels policy, clarify some labels.

  - bal: support CSV output for --budget reports (#1155)

  - check: A new command which consolidating the various check-* commands.
    It runs the default, strict, or specified checks and produces
    no output and a zero exit code if all is well.

  - check-dates: this command is deprecated and will be removed
    in next release; use "hledger check ordereddates" instead.

  - check-dupes: this command is deprecated and will be removed
    in next release; use "hledger check uniqueleafnames" instead.

  - import: The journal's commodity styles (declared or inferred) are now applied
    to imported amounts, overriding their original number format.

  - roi: TWR now handles same-day pnl changes and cashflows,
    calculation failure messages have been improved, and
    the documentation includes more detail and examples.
    (#1398) (Dmitry Astapov)

  ## journal format

  - The journal's commodity styles are now applied to forecasted transactions. (#1371)

  - journal, csv: commodity style is now inferred from the first amount, as documented,
    not the last. This was "working wrongly" since hledger 1.12..

  - A zero market price no longer causes "Ratio has zero denominator" error
    in valued reports. (#1373)

  ## csv format

  - The new `decimal-mark` rule allows reliable number parsing
    when CSV numbers contain digit group marks (eg thousands separators).

  - The CSV reader's verbose "assignment" debug output is now at level 9.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 02:00:34 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hledger to version 1.19.1.
  # 1.19.1 2020-09-07

  - Fix alignment of coloured numbers (#1345, #1349, Stephen Morgan)

  - Fix a regression in account type autodetection for accounts with
    capitalised names. (#1341)

  - Allow megaparsec 9

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 02:00:39 UTC 2020 - psimons@suse.com

- Update hledger to version 1.19.
  # 1.19 2020-09-01

  ## general

  - When parsing dates, the year is now required to have at least four
    digits. So eg we no longer accept `200/1/1` as a valid date, it
    would need to be written `0200/1/1`. This was done for.. reasons,
    and is experimental; let us know if it causes you trouble.

  - The --color/--colour=WHEN command line option, support for the
    NO_COLOR environment variable, and smarter autodetection of colour
    terminals have been added (#1296)

  - Command line options taking a numeric argument are now validated
    more carefully, preventing issues with unexpected negatives or Int
    overflow. (Stephen Morgan)

  - In queries, you can now specify a quarter like `2020q1` or `q4`
    (the q is case-insensitive). (#1247, Henning Thieleman, Stephen Morgan)

  - In report intervals, `fortnightly` has been added as a synonym for
    `biweekly`. (Stephen Morgan)

  - -t and -l command line flags have been added as short forms of
    --tree and --flat (#1286)

  - All reports displaying accounts now choose flat mode by default
    (Stephen Morgan)

  - Reports now show at most 2 commodities of multicommodity amounts,
    unless the --no-elide flag is used. This helps keep them readable by
    default, since multicolumn, multicommodity balance reports otherwise
    tend to become very wide, especially in tree mode.

  - Numbers with more than 255 decimal places, which we do not support,
    now give an error instead of silently misparsing. (#1326)

  - Digit groups are now limited to at most 255 digits each. (#1326)

  - Account aliases (on command line or in journal) containing a bad
    regular expression now give a more detailed error message.

  - A tab character could get parsed as part of a commodity symbol, with
    confusing results. This no longer happens. (#1301, Dmitry Astapov)

  - Debug output is now organised better by debug level.
    The levels are:

    0. normal command output only (no warnings)
    1. useful warnings & most common troubleshooting info (valuation, eg)
    2. common troubleshooting info, more detail
    3. report options selection
    4. report generation
    5. report generation, more detail
    6. input file reading
    7. input file reading, more detail
    8. command line parsing
    9. any other rarely needed or more in-depth info

  - Added a missing lower bound for aeson, making cabal installs more
    reliable. (#1268)

  - lib: parseAmountQueryTerm: allow whitespace around arg parts (#1312)
    Whitespace around the operator, sign, or number is now tolerated.

  ## commands

  - account,bal,bs,cf,is: --drop now also works in tree mode (Stephen Morgan)

  - add: fix an error in the command line help (arguments are inputs,
    not a query)

  - aregister: a new command showing a transaction-oriented account
    register, like hledger-ui, hledger-web, or your bank statement.
    Each line represents a whole transaction in one account, unlike
    the register command which shows individual postings possibly from
    multiple accounts. You might prefer aregister when reconciling
    real-world asset/liability accounts, and register when reviewing
    detailed revenues/expenses. (#1294)

  - bal,bs,cf,is: boring parents are now elided by default in tabular
    balance reports too, like single-column reports. (Stephen Morgan)

  - bal,bs,cf,is: monthly column headings are no longer elided to just
    the short month name, if multiple years are being displayed.

  - bal --budget's column headings are now end dates rather than
    periods when appropriate (ie with --cumulative or --historical).

  - bs,cf,is: -%/--no-total no longer forces --no-total (Stephen Morgan)

  - bs,cf,is: --no-total now hides subtotals as well as the grand total
    (Stephen Morgan)

  - codes: a new command for listing transaction codes

  - print: a new `sql` output format has been added (Dmitry Astapov)

  - roi: errors are now shown without a call stack

  - tags: add --parsed flag, hide empties without --empty. With the
    --parsed flag, all tags or values are shown in the order they are
    parsed from the input data, including duplicates. With -E/--empty,
    any blank/empty values will also be shown, otherwise they are
    omitted.

  ## journal format

  - account directives can specify a new `Cash` account type. This is a
    subtype of `Asset`, denoting accounts which should be displayed
    in `cashflow` reports.

  - The built-in regular expressions for choosing default account types
    have been tweaked, and documentation for account types has been
    improved.

  ## csv format

  - Inferring the appropriate default field separator based on file
    extension (, for .csv, ; for .ssv, \t for .tsv) now works as
    documented.

  - Conditional rule patterns can now be grouped with the `&` (AND) operator,
    allowing more powerful matching. (Michael Sanders)

  - Invalid csv rules files now give clearer parse error messages.
    (Dmitry Astapov)

  - "If tables", a compact bulk format for conditional rules, have been
    added. (Dmitry Astapov)

  - csv conversion with a lot of conditional rules is now faster (Dmitry Astapov)
