- Update hledger to version 1.19.
  # 1.19 2020-09-01

  ## general

  - When parsing dates, the year is now required to have at least four
    digits. So eg we no longer accept `200/1/1` as a valid date, it
    would need to be written `0200/1/1`. This was done for.. reasons,
    and is experimental; let us know if it causes you trouble.

  - The --color/--colour=WHEN command line option, support for the
    NO_COLOR environment variable, and smarter autodetection of colour
    terminals have been added (#1296)

  - Command line options taking a numeric argument are now validated
    more carefully, preventing issues with unexpected negatives or Int
    overflow. (Stephen Morgan)

  - In queries, you can now specify a quarter like `2020q1` or `q4`
    (the q is case-insensitive). (#1247, Henning Thieleman, Stephen Morgan)

  - In report intervals, `fortnightly` has been added as a synonym for
    `biweekly`. (Stephen Morgan)

  - -t and -l command line flags have been added as short forms of
    --tree and --flat (#1286)

  - All reports displaying accounts now choose flat mode by default
    (Stephen Morgan)

  - Reports now show at most 2 commodities of multicommodity amounts,
    unless the --no-elide flag is used. This helps keep them readable by
    default, since multicolumn, multicommodity balance reports otherwise
    tend to become very wide, especially in tree mode.

  - Numbers with more than 255 decimal places, which we do not support,
    now give an error instead of silently misparsing. (#1326)

  - Digit groups are now limited to at most 255 digits each. (#1326)

  - Account aliases (on command line or in journal) containing a bad
    regular expression now give a more detailed error message.

  - A tab character could get parsed as part of a commodity symbol, with
    confusing results. This no longer happens. (#1301, Dmitry Astapov)

  - Debug output is now organised better by debug level.
    The levels are:

    0. normal command output only (no warnings)
    1. useful warnings & most common troubleshooting info (valuation, eg)
    2. common troubleshooting info, more detail
    3. report options selection
    4. report generation
    5. report generation, more detail
    6. input file reading
    7. input file reading, more detail
    8. command line parsing
    9. any other rarely needed or more in-depth info

  - Added a missing lower bound for aeson, making cabal installs more
    reliable. (#1268)

  - lib: parseAmountQueryTerm: allow whitespace around arg parts (#1312)
    Whitespace around the operator, sign, or number is now tolerated.

  ## commands

  - account,bal,bs,cf,is: --drop now also works in tree mode (Stephen Morgan)

  - add: fix an error in the command line help (arguments are inputs,
    not a query)

  - aregister: a new command showing a transaction-oriented account
    register, like hledger-ui, hledger-web, or your bank statement.
    Each line represents a whole transaction in one account, unlike
    the register command which shows individual postings possibly from
    multiple accounts. You might prefer aregister when reconciling
    real-world asset/liability accounts, and register when reviewing
    detailed revenues/expenses. (#1294)

  - bal,bs,cf,is: boring parents are now elided by default in tabular
    balance reports too, like single-column reports. (Stephen Morgan)

  - bal,bs,cf,is: monthly column headings are no longer elided to just
    the short month name, if multiple years are being displayed.

  - bal --budget's column headings are now end dates rather than
    periods when appropriate (ie with --cumulative or --historical).

  - bs,cf,is: -%/--no-total no longer forces --no-total (Stephen Morgan)

  - bs,cf,is: --no-total now hides subtotals as well as the grand total
    (Stephen Morgan)

  - codes: a new command for listing transaction codes

  - print: a new `sql` output format has been added (Dmitry Astapov)

  - roi: errors are now shown without a call stack

  - tags: add --parsed flag, hide empties without --empty. With the
    --parsed flag, all tags or values are shown in the order they are
    parsed from the input data, including duplicates. With -E/--empty,
    any blank/empty values will also be shown, otherwise they are
    omitted.

  ## journal format

  - account directives can specify a new `Cash` account type. This is a
    subtype of `Asset`, denoting accounts which should be displayed
    in `cashflow` reports.

  - The built-in regular expressions for choosing default account types
    have been tweaked, and documentation for account types has been
    improved.

  ## csv format

  - Inferring the appropriate default field separator based on file
    extension (, for .csv, ; for .ssv, \t for .tsv) now works as
    documented.

  - Conditional rule patterns can now be grouped with the `&` (AND) operator,
    allowing more powerful matching. (Michael Sanders)

  - Invalid csv rules files now give clearer parse error messages.
    (Dmitry Astapov)

  - "If tables", a compact bulk format for conditional rules, have been
    added. (Dmitry Astapov)

  - csv conversion with a lot of conditional rules is now faster (Dmitry Astapov)
