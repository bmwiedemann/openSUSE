- Remove unsupported options from example haproxy.cfg
- Make haproxy useable for containers
  - Use sysusers.d to create users.
  - Use systemd_ordering instead of requiring systemd.
  - Own vim syntax directory instead of requiring vim. This also

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 17 12:33:47 UTC 2019 - kgronlund@suse.com

- Update to version 2.0.0~git0.ba23630a:
  - new internal native HTTP representation called HTX, was already in 1.9
    and is now enabled by default in 2.0 ;

  - end-to-end HTTP/2 support including trailers and continuation frames,
    as needed for gRPC ; HTTP/2 may also be upgraded from HTTP/1.1 using
    the H2 preface;

  - server connection pooling and more advanced reuse, with ALPN protocol
    negotiation (already in 1.9) ;

  - layer 7 retries, allowing to use 0-RTT and TCP Fast Open to the servers
    as well as on the frontend ;

  - much more scalable multi-threading, which is even enabled by default on
    platforms where it was successfully tested ; by default, as many threads
    are started as the number of CPUs haproxy is allowed to run on. This
    removes a lot of configuration burden in VMs and containers ;

  - automatic maxconn setting for the process and the frontends, directly
    based on the number of available FDs (easier configuration in containers
    and with systemd) ;

  - logging to stdout for use in containers and systemd (already in 1.9).
    Logs can now provide micro-second resolution for some events ;

  - peers now support SSL, declaration of multiple stick-tables directly in
    the peers section, and synchronization of server names, not just IDs ;

  - In master-worker mode, the master process now exposes its own CLI and
    can communicate with all other processes (including the stopping ones),
    even allowing to connect to their CLI and check their state. It is also
    possible to start some sidecar programs and monitor them from the master,
    and the master can automatically kill old processes that survived too
    many reloads ;

  - the incoming connections are load-balanced between all threads depending
    on their load to minimize the processing time and maximize the capacity
    (already in 1.9) ;

  - the SPOE connection load-balancing was significantly improved in order
    to reduce high percentiles of SPOA response time (already in 1.9) ;

  - the "random" load balancing algorithm and a power-of-two-choices variant
    were introduced ;

  - statistics improvements with per-thread counters for certain things, and
    a prometheus exporter for all our statistics;

  - lots of debugging help, it's easier to produce a core dump, there are
    new commands on the CLI to control various things, there is a watchdog
    to fail cleanly when a thread deadlock or a spinning task are detected,
    so overall it should provide a better experience in field and less
    round trips between users and developers (hence less stress during an
    incident).

  - all 3 device detection engines are now compatible with multi-threading
    and can be build-tested without any external dependencies ;

  - "do-resolve" http-request action to perform a DNS resolution on any,
    sample, and resolvers now support relying on /etc/resolv.conf to match
    the local resolver ;

  - log sampling and balancing : it's now possible to send 1 log every 10
    to a server, or to spread the logging load over multiple log servers;

  - a new SPOA agent (spoa_server) allows to interface haproxy with Python
    and Lua programs ;

  - support for Solaris' event ports (equivalent of kqueue or epoll) which
    will significantly improve the performance there when dealing with
    numerous connections ;

  - some warnings are now reported for some deprecated options that will
    be removed in 2.1. Since 2.0 is long term supported, there's no
    emergency to convert them, however if you see these warnings, you
    need to understand that you're among their extremely rare users and
    just because of this you may be taking risks by keeping them ;

  - A new SOCKS4 server-side layer was provided ; it allows outgoing
    connections to be forwarded through a SOCKS4 proxy (such as ssh -D).

  - priority- and latency- aware server queues : it is possible now to
    assign priorities to certain requests and/or to give them a time
    bonus or penalty to refine control of the traffic and be able to
    engage on SLAs.

  - internally the architecture was significantly redesigned to allow to
    further improve performance and make it easier to implement protocols
    that span over multiple layers (such as QUIC). This work started in
    1.9 and will continue with 2.1.

  - the I/O, applets and tasks now share the same multi-threaded scheduler,
    giving a much better responsiveness and fairness between all tasks as
    is visible with the CLI which always responds instantly even under
    extreme loads (started in 1.9) ;

  - the internal buffers were redesigned to ease zero-copy operations, so
    that it is possible to sustain a high bandwidth even when forwarding
    HTTP/1 to/from HTTP/2 (already in 1.9) ;

Tue Oct 13 19:39:12 UTC 2015 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 1.6.0
  The most user-visible changes, we can cite the simpler handling
  of multiple configuration files, the support for quotes and
  environment variables in the configuration, a significant
  reduction of the memory usage thanks to a new dynamic buffer
  allocator, notifications over e-mail, server state keeping across
  reloads, dynamic DNS-based server address resolution, new
  scripting capabilities thanks to the embedded Lua interpreter,
  use of variables in the configuration to manipulate samples,
  request body buffering and analysis, support for two third-party
  device identification products (DeviceAtlas and 51Degrees), a lot
  of new sample converters including arithmetic operators and table
  lookups, TLS ticket secret sharing between nodes, TLS SNI to the
  server, full tables replication between peers, ability to
  instruct the kernel to quickly kill dead connections, support for
  Linux namespaces, and a number of other less visible goodies. The
  performance has also been improved a lot with support for server
  connection multiplexing, much faster and cheaper HTTP compression
  via libslz, and the addition of a pattern cache to speed up
  certain expensive ACLs. The great flexibility offered by this
  version will allow many users to significantly simplify their
  configurations. Some users will notice a huge performance boost
  after they enable the features designed for them.

- pulled 2 fixes from git:
  - 0001-BUG-MEDIUM-patterns-previous-fix-was-incomplete.patch
    Dmitry Sivachenko <trtrmitya@gmail.com> reported that commit
    315ec42 ("BUG/MEDIUM: pattern: don't load more than once a
    pattern list.") relies on an uninitialised variable in the
    stack. While it used to work fine during the tests, if the
    uninitialized variable is non-null, some patterns may be
    aggregated if loaded multiple times, resulting in slower
    processing, which was the original issue it tried to address.
  - 0002-BUG-MEDIUM-payload-ensure-that-a-request-channel-is-.patch
    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported a segfault when using certain
    sample fetch functions in the "tcp-request connection" rulesets
    despite the warnings. This is because some tests for the
    existence of the channel were missing.

Fri Jun 20 14:37:21 UTC 2014 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 1.5.0
  For people who don't follow the development versions, 1.5 expands
  1.4 with many new features and performance improvements,
  including native SSL support on both sides with SNI/NPN/ALPN and
  OCSP stapling, IPv6 and UNIX sockets are supported everywhere,
  full HTTP keep-alive for better support of NTLM and improved
  efficiency in static farms, HTTP/1.1 compression (deflate, gzip)
  to save bandwidth, PROXY protocol versions 1 and 2 on both sides,
  data sampling on everything in request or response, including
  payload, ACLs can use any matching method with any input sample
  maps and dynamic ACLs updatable from the CLI stick-tables support
  counters to track activity on any input sample custom format for
  logs, unique-id, header rewriting, and redirects, improved health
  checks (SSL, scripted TCP, check agent, ...), much more scalable
  configuration supports hundreds of thousands of backends and
  certificates without sweating.

  For all the details see /usr/share/doc/packages/haproxy/CHANGELOG

- initial package of 1.2.16
- added 2 patches:
  haproxy-1.2.16_config_haproxy_user.patch
  haproxy-1.2.16_username_groupname_support.patch
  the patches allow to specify username and groupname instead of
  uid/gid. The patches are needed as we do not have a static
  uid/gid for the haproxy user/group.
