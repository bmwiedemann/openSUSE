Packaging notes regarding QUIC:

We enable QUIC for Tumbleweed where OpenSSL 3.x is the default.
OpenSSL is not the perfect fit, but it's better than nothing - the best recommendation by HAProxy currently seems to be AWS-LC, but we do not ship it.

Note to remove USE_QUIC_OPENSSL_COMPAT if switching to a different implementation in the future.
