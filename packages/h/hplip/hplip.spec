%description
The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing project (HPLIP) provides
a unified single and multifunction connectivity solution for HP
printers, scanners, and all-in-one devices.

This package contains command line and UI front-ends for HPLIP, and tools
for extra functionality such as status and supply information. It is
not required for basic printing and scanning with HP hardware, except
for those devices that need the proprietary hplip plugin, see
https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/binary_plugin.html

%package hpijs
Summary:        Printer drivers for HP printers and all-in-one devices
# On a minimalist system only hplip-hpijs may be installed
# or on a minimalist package repository (e.g. on the openSUSE CDs)
# only hplip-hpijs may be available (even when a usual system is installed).
# When only hplip-hpijs is there, it should tell the dependency resolver
# that for usual functionality, hplip should be installed too (if possible).
# Unfortunately the installer ignores suggested packages silently
# but on the other hand I cannot use "Recommends hplip" here
# because the installer installs recommended packages silently
# which would bloat a minimal selection (when hplip is available to be installed)
# because the minimal selection contains hplip-hpijs which recommends hplip
# so that the installer installs hplip and all what this requires silently
# see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=546893
# Require only the matching version of the hplip main-package
# (compare the "Requires: hplip-hpijs" entry above) but do not depend
# on the exact matching release because the exact matching release
# may be not available to be installed (e.g. when hplip-hpijs-1.2.3-4.5 is
# installed from the openSUSE CDs but on our official online repository
# only hplip-1.2.3-6.7 is available which should usually also work):
Group:          Hardware/Printing

# to document the ghostscript <-> hplip-hpijs relationship:
Enhances:       ghostscript
# hpijs-standalone was a stand-alone minimalist package
# which is no longer provided since a long time.
# hplip-hpijs and hpijs-standalone both contain /usr/bin/hpijs
# so that both packages have a RPM conflict which should
# be solved by a silent replacement of the old hpijs-standalone.
# This Obsoletes is intentionally unversioned because
# hplip-hpijs should replace any version of hpijs-standalone.
Obsoletes:      hpijs-standalone
# Either the hplip17 packages or the hplip packages can be installed,

# PackMan provides HPLIP in the packages hplip and hplip-hpcups.

# are installed together with a leftover PackMan package hplip-hpcups
# see https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515005#c17

Obsoletes:      hplip-hpcups

%description hpijs
This package contains the backend drivers and PPDs for printing
with HP printers using CUPS.

HPCUPS is HPLIP's native CUPS printer driver for HP printers.
HPIJS (deprecated) is HPLIP's Ghostscript printer driver for
HP printers, and only used for some Fax devices nowadays.

Install the "hplip" package if you need the proprietary HP plugin
required by some devices, or additional functionality besides plain
printing.

%package sane
Summary:        SANE backends for HP scanners and all-in-one devices
# Require the exact matching version-release of the hpijs sub-package to make sure
# to have the exact matching version of libhpip and libhpmud installed.
# A wrong library version may let libsane-hpaio crash (e.g. segfault)
# which lets the whole scanning stack frontend<->libsane-dll<->libsane-backend crash
# also for any other backend when the hpaio backend is enabled (e.g. "scanimage -L"):

%description sane
This package includes the backend driver for scanning with HP scanners
and all-in-one devices using SANE tools like xsane or scanimage.

%package scan-utils
Summary:        HPLIP scanning frontends hp-scan and hp-uiscan
# SLE does not provide python-pillow (PIL) (bsc#1131613)
Group:          Hardware/Scanner
Requires:       %{pymod Pillow}
# hp-scan et al. import skimage from the scikit-image package.
# It is pretty heavy-weight and pulls in various other packages.
Requires:       %{pymod scikit-image}

Provides:       %{name}-scan = %{version}-%{release}
Obsoletes:      %{name}-scan < %{version}-%{release}

%description scan-utils
This package provides the "hp-scan" and "hp-uiscan" frontend utilities. These
utilities are alternatives to the SANE frontends "xsane" and "scanimage". They
expose some advanced features of certain HP scanner models.

# --enable-foomatic-ppd-install enable foomatic static ppd install (default=no), uses hpppddir

# Final test by cupstestppd:
# To save disk space gzip the files (gzipped PPDs can also be used by CUPS).
# Future goal: Only have files which don't FAIL for cupstestppd.
# Ignore FAILs because of errors in UIConstraints and/or NonUIConstraints
# which are detected since cupstestppd in CUPS > 1.2.7 (i.e. in openSUSE 10.3).
# See Novell/Suse Bugzilla bug #309822: When this bug is fixed, cupstestppd would
# no longer result zero exit code.
# In the long run the PPDs should be fixed but as far as we know there have been
# no problems because of such UIConstraints errors so that it should be o.k.
# let those PPDs pass even if they are not strictly compliant.
# Ignore FAILs because of missing cupsFilter programs because
# in the package build environment the usual HPLIP filters
# like "hpcups" and "hpcupsfax" are
# installed at an unusual place (in the BuildRoot directory).
# For now keep all PPDs even if cupstestppd FAILs.
# Reason:
# With each CUPS version upgrade cupstestppd finds more and more errors
# so that more and more PPDs would be no longer included in the RPM
# which have been included before which results a regression.
# As far as we know there have been no problems at all because of
# not strictly compliant PPDs in HPLIP so that it is much better
# to provide all HPLIP PPDs so that the matching printers can be used
# than to be rigorous regarding enforcing compliance to the PPD specification:
