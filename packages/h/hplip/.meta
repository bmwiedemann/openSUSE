  <title>HP's Printing, Scanning, and Faxing Software</title>
  <description>The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing project (HPLIP) provides
a unified single and multifunction connectivity solution for HP
printers and scanners (in particular, HP all-in-one devices).

HPLIP provides unified connectivity for printing, scanning, sending
faxes, photo card access, and device management and is designed to work
with CUPS.

It includes the Ghostscript printer driver HPIJS for HP printers and a
special &quot;hp&quot; CUPS back-end that provides bidirectional communication
with the device (required for HP printer device management).

It also includes the SANE scanner driver &quot;hpaio&quot; for HP all-in-one
devices. Basic PC send fax functionality is supported on a number of
devices.

The special &quot;hpfax&quot; CUPS back-end is required to send faxes. Direct
uploading (i.e. without print and scan) of received faxes from the
device to the PC is not supported.

The &quot;hp-toolbox&quot; program is provided for device management.

The &quot;hp-sendfax&quot; program must be used to send faxes.

The &quot;hp-setup&quot; program can be used to set up HP all-in-one devices.

The HPLIP project is open source software and uses GPL-compatible
licenses. For more information, see:
