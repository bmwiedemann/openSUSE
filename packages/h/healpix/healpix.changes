- Update to version 3.80:
  * General:
    - addition of SHARP_PARAL and CXX_PARAL to control the
      parallel implementation of the libsharp library and C++
      library and codes.
    - PYTHON now defaults to python3.
  * C++:
    - the line-integral convolution interface is now accessible
      not only from the command line, but also via C++ calls, to
      allow calling from healpy.
    - some internals were restructured to allow easier integration
      with SWIG.
  * Fortran 90 facilities and subroutines:
    - Improvement of query_disc routine in inclusive mode.
    - The routines alm2map_spin and map2alm_spin now accept any
      (integer) spin values |s|>=0, but the scalar routines
      alm2map and map2alm are still recommended for vanishing spin
      (s=0).
    - Correction of bugs preventing the compilation with versions
      10.* of gfortran.
    - Fixed bug affecting map2gif when compiled with versions 10.*
      of gfortran and gcc.

  while omitting idl source files: this avoids licensing issues
  that the idl source files carry.
