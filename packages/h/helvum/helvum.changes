Tue Nov 30 20:19:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.3.2
  - Changes:
    - Links where the endpoint is left of the start point and on the same height
      now have a slight vertical component in their curve so they don't appear
      as a single line
    - Links now use a gray instead of black color for better constrast
  - Fixes:
    - Build scripts now use bash instead of sh, as they were already using bash
      features before, which could lead to problems where sh is not a symlink to
      bash
  - Also, from now on, releases will have a source tarball with vendored cargo
    dependencies attached, so that releases can be built offline easier.
