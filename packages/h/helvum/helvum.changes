- update to 0.4.0
  - Improvements
    - The graphview no longer renders content outside the visible area and uses
      less CPU drawing, which should improve performance greatly.
    - The graphview can now be zoomed. Zooming is possible via
      two-finger-gesture, CTRL+Scrolling, and a zoom widget in the header bar.
    - The graphview now has a fixed size, and the view is initially centered in
      middle.
    - Labels on nodes and ports now may use multiple lines when too long, and
      very long labels will be ellipsized. A new tooltip is displayed when
      hovering a label, which displays the full name and is never ellipsized.
    - The label for a node now prefers displaying the node.description property
      over the node.nick property of a pipewire node, which is usually more
      human-readable and helpful, and also matches the behaviour of other tools.
  - Fixes
    - Helvum should build again with pipewire versions 0.3.64 and 0.3.65 due to
      an updated pipewire dependency.

Tue Nov 30 20:19:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.3.2
  - Changes:
    - Links where the endpoint is left of the start point and on the same height
      now have a slight vertical component in their curve so they don't appear
      as a single line
    - Links now use a gray instead of black color for better constrast
  - Fixes:
    - Build scripts now use bash instead of sh, as they were already using bash
      features before, which could lead to problems where sh is not a symlink to
      bash
  - Also, from now on, releases will have a source tarball with vendored cargo
    dependencies attached, so that releases can be built offline easier.
