Thu Sep 28 14:12:34 UTC 2023 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.5.1
  - Fix an issue where the headerbar is overly large
- update to 0.5.0
  - Helvum has been ported to libadwaita, and now requires libadwaita >= 1.3 to
    build.
  - The graph UI has been redesigned to fit the libadwaita style and to improve
    usability and looks. Nodes now have a background, ports are split into a
    label and a round handle, and more minor changes.
  - Ports are now added and removed more reliably from nodes, and are sorted by
    name.
  - An "About" window has been added, and can be opened using the new primary
    menu, opened by a button in the headerbar.
  - The application no longer enters an unusable state if the app can't connect
    to the pipewire server, or loses connection. Instead, the app will attempt
    to reconnect on an interval, and display a banner in the UI to notify the
    user that the app is not connected.
- started using cargo-packaging

Mon Aug 21 15:01:19 UTC 2023 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.4.1
  - Nodes are now allocated their proper size when the graph is zoomed, so that
    they do not become smaller when the graph is zoomed in.
  - When dragging a port to create a link, a link is now drawn from the port to
    the cursor position to visualize the linking process. If hovering over a
    compatible port, the link snaps to that port.
  - Multiple internal improvements.

Mon Feb 13 08:21:08 UTC 2023 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.4.0
  - Improvements
    - The graphview no longer renders content outside the visible area and uses
      less CPU drawing, which should improve performance greatly.
    - The graphview can now be zoomed. Zooming is possible via
      two-finger-gesture, CTRL+Scrolling, and a zoom widget in the header bar.
    - The graphview now has a fixed size, and the view is initially centered in
      middle.
    - Labels on nodes and ports now may use multiple lines when too long, and
      very long labels will be ellipsized. A new tooltip is displayed when
      hovering a label, which displays the full name and is never ellipsized.
    - The label for a node now prefers displaying the node.description property
      over the node.nick property of a pipewire node, which is usually more
      human-readable and helpful, and also matches the behaviour of other tools.
  - Fixes
    - Helvum should build again with pipewire versions 0.3.64 and 0.3.65 due to
      an updated pipewire dependency.

Wed Feb  2 13:04:21 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.3.4
  - Update glib dependency, which fixes a SIGSEGV when using glib as a log
    backend and the output is being captured by systemd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 28 21:03:21 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.3.3
  - An appstream metadata file was added and is installed to the metainfo directory
  - gtk4-update-icon-cache instead of the gtk3 variant is used during post-install
  - The application id was changed to `org.pipewire.Helvum`
  - Bash build scripts were removed and their work is done directly via meson instead
  - The upstream URL has changed to https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/helvum

  - Changed location of hicolor folder to properly display app icon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 30 20:19:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 0.3.2
  - Changes:
    - Links where the endpoint is left of the start point and on the same height
      now have a slight vertical component in their curve so they don't appear
      as a single line
    - Links now use a gray instead of black color for better constrast
  - Fixes:
    - Build scripts now use bash instead of sh, as they were already using bash
      features before, which could lead to problems where sh is not a symlink to
      bash
  - Also, from now on, releases will have a source tarball with vendored cargo
    dependencies attached, so that releases can be built offline easier.
