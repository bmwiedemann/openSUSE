  <title>Free Chinese-German Dictionary in EDICT Format</title>
  <description>This is a free Chinese-German dictionary that can be used, for example,
with Gjiten.

Everyone is invited to help develop it together with the authors (see
URL and e-mail addresses in the author list). It is based in large
parts on CEDICT which in turn has been modelled on Jim Breen's highly
successful EDICT (Japanese-English dictionary) project.</description>
