  * Added the **popup_menu_accept_key option, for controlling which
    key accepts the current option for a popup menu, such as the

    two new commands: project-file-search and project-file-search-list

  * Performance and functionality improvements for the matcher, used
    in Howl selection lists, enabling fast matching across much

    Between 30x and 32x faster.
  * Respect use_tabs option when commenting
  * Ensure scrolling works correctly for Gtk+ 3.4

    file in a asynchronous Howl context.

   visited locations. Two new commands, navigate-back and
   navigate-forward were added, bound to ctrl_< and ctrl_> respectively.
  * Improved key translation for keys when caps lock is on.
  * Added two new commands, editor-newline-above and editor-newline-below,
    that insert a new line above/below the current line. Bound these
    commands to ctrl_shift_return and ctrl_return.
