- Update to 0.6:
  * Added navigate-go-to command, for going back to a specific
    previous location.
  * Added support for a “journal” buffer showing the Howl log,
    available via open-journal.

  * Added support for specifying line and column when opening files
  * Added support for custom user fonts
  * Added project-switch-buffer command that displays open buffers
    within the current project.
  * Added two inspectors and a command for documentation to the Go mode
  * Moving cursor left or right with a selection active now cancels
    the selection, leaving the cursor at the corresponding end.
  * Added proper structure support for C/C++ mode
  * Base scheme support on the newer lisp mode instead of old basic mode
  * Added the **popup_menu_accept_key option, for controlling which
    key accepts the current option for a popup menu, such as the
    completion popup. Valid values are ‘enter’ (the default) or ‘tab’.
  * Close completion popup when user activity warrants it
  * Added new built-in theme: Dracula
  * Added integrated and fast project file search functionality via
    two new commands: project-file-search and project-file-search-list
  * Javascript: Support for ES6 templates and new keywords and operators
  * Performance and functionality improvements for the matcher, used
    in Howl selection lists, enabling fast matching across much
    larger data sets.
  * Performance improvements for recursive file selection.
    Between 30x and 32x faster.
  * Respect use_tabs option when commenting
  * Ensure scrolling works correctly for Gtk+ 3.4
  * Dart bundle enhancements: improved syntax highlighting
  * Added support for activities - potentially longer running activities
    that should run in a apparently blocking way to the user.
  * Added a new commandline flag, --run-async, for running a particular
    file in a asynchronous Howl context.
  * Added support for shared, low precision after timers
  * Added options for controlling scrolling speed
  * Add support for smooth scrolling events
  * Fixed background drawing for Wayland/Weston/CSD environments.
  * Requested that titlebar is hidden for newer versions of Gnome 3.
  * Added support for navigating back and forth in a list of previously
   visited locations. Two new commands, navigate-back and
   navigate-forward were added, bound to ctrl_< and ctrl_> respectively.
  * Improved key translation for keys when caps lock is on.
  * Added two new commands, editor-newline-above and editor-newline-below,
    that insert a new line above/below the current line. Bound these
    commands to ctrl_shift_return and ctrl_return.
  * Auto detect line endings when opening a file if possible
  * For details see: https://howl.io/blog/2019/04/05/howl-0-6-released.html
