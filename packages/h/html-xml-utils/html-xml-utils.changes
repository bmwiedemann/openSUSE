- update to version 7.8:
 * textwrap.c, langinfo.c, hxnormalize.c: Added knowledge about
   languages that do not use spaces between words. In such languages,
   a newline should not be converted to a space in outc() in
   textwrap.c, but only to a break opportunity.
 * hxtoc.c: The element to group headings in HTML5 is called
   HGROUP, not HEADER. The heading of a section (SECTION, ARTICLE,
   etc.) need not be the first element, there may be non-header
   elements before it.
 * hxwls.c: Print "longdesc", "classid" or "codebase" in the second
   column for the corresponding attribute. Also recognize srcset
   (somewhat).
 * hxnormalize.c: Added option -X to indicate the input is XML
   instead of HTML. Handle conversion of CDATA elements to XML by
   escaping < and & instead of adding <![CDATA[. Added corresponding
   test normalize13.sh.

- update to version 7.7:
 * dtd.hash: Don't include the arguments in the forward declaration
   of lookup_element(), because those arguments differ slightly
   depending on which version of gperf is used to generate dtd.c:
   "unsigned int" in gperf 3.0 vs "size_t" in gperf 3.1.
 * conficgure.ac: Check for libiconv with the AM_ICONV macro (from
   gettext) instead of AC_SEARCH_LIBS. (Advice from Christian
   Weisgerber, received via Anthony Bentley). That in turn requires
   adding config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am.
 * hxindex.c: Replaced fgets() by getline(), to allow lines of
   arbitrary length in the term database.
