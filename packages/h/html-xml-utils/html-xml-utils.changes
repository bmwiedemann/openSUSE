- Fix compilation error on tumbleweed with fix-dtd-declaration.patch:
  dtd.hash:117:1: error: conflicting types for ‘lookup_element’; have ‘const ElementType *(const char *, size_t)’ {aka ‘const struct _ElementType *(const char *, long unsigned int)’}
    117 | link,           0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, {"head", NULL}
        | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  dtd.hash:46:28: note: previous declaration of ‘lookup_element’ with type ‘const ElementType *(void)’ {aka ‘const struct _ElementType *(void)’}
- Add basic check section.

Sat Mar  8 15:52:58 UTC 2025 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to version 8.7:
  * textwrap.c: Corrected counting of visible characters on a line
    (bufchars).
  * hxcopy.c: Fixed error in an error message.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  4 14:27:28 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to version 8.6:
	* tests/select34.sh: Use "tr" instead of "xarg" to replace \0 by
	\n. (The xargs command on BSD ignores empty input lines, the GNU
	version does not.) Also use "printf" instead of "echo" to write to
	the log file, because it seems to be more consistent between
	different shells.

	* hxselect.c: Fixed a bug in parsing octal escapes in the
	separator string (option -s). Patch provided by Jorrit Fahlke.

	* errexit.c: Removed. Consistently use err() and errx()
	everywhere.

	* hxwls.c, printlinks.c, hxcopy.c: Allow white space before and
	after URLs in attributes. (Allowed by HTML5.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  1 18:43:35 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 8.4:
 * hxselect.c: The :attr() pseudo-element was only matched if it
   was on the first selector, not if it was on a subsequent selector
   in a comma-separated list of selectors. (Found and fixed by Bas
   Ploeger.)
 * tests/select33.sh: Added test for multiple :attr()
   selectors. (Contributed by Bas Ploeger.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 11 15:17:14 UTC 2022 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 8.3:
 * dtd.hash: Make <head> rather than <body> the preferred parent
   for <script>. Allow text in the <body> element, without requiring a
   <p> or other element around it.
 * tests/pipe5.sh, tests/pipe6.sh, tests/pipe7.sh: Added tests for
   the -H option of hxpipe.
 * hxpipe.c: Add option -H, which assumes the input is HTML and adds
   implied tags and parses script and style elements as literal text.
   hxpipe now outputs attributes in a normalized order
   (alphabetical). Remove a redundant "if".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 21 08:46:21 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- Update to version 8.1:
 * tests/select11.sh, tests/select12.sh, tests/select13.sh,
 tests/select19.sh, tests/select21.sh: Added some text and
 comments, to test that they are correctly skipped.
 * tests/select31.sh, tests/select32.sh, Makefile.am: Added two
 tests for the sibling selector (~).
 * selmatch.c: Sibling selector failed to skip non-element nodes.
 * dict.c: Deleting an entry with dict_destroy() made entries with
 the same hash value that were stored in subsequent slots
 inaccessible. The dict_destroy() function isn't used in any of the
 HTML-XML-utils, but other programs may borrow this module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  2 20:39:02 UTC 2021 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 8.0:
  * selector.c, selmatch.c: Also parse and process the experimental
  ":is()" and ":where()" pseudo-classes. Correct a bug in parsing
  comma-separated selectors. Correct a bug in esc() that caused an
  empty string to fail (e.g., in [alt=""]. (The function esc() is not
  used, but could be used when debugging.)
  * tests/select14.sh: Test ":empty" in combination with another
  pseudo-class.
  * Makefile.am: Added tests select26.sh, select27.sh, select28.sh,
  select29.sh and select30.sh
  * configure.ac: Added AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to enable seek() to seek
  large files and the off_t type to be 64 bits on older, 32-bit
  systems. Also check for limits.h.
  * hxselect.1: Noted the known bug that case-insensitive selectors
  (option -i) only work with ASCII characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 11 07:45:54 UTC 2021 - Wang Jun <jgwang@suse.com>

- Update to version 7.9
  * unent.hash: gperf 3.1 generates size_t instead of unsigned int.
  * Makefile.am: Call gperf on unent.hash with "-k 1-6" instead of
    "-k 1,2,$ -D". Added test select25.sh.
  * select25.sh: Test added. (Contributed by Hugo Peixoto.)
  * selector.c: An attribute selector with an empty string such as
    [foo=''], resulted in a NULL value instead of an empty string,
    which led to a crash. (Found and fixed by Hugo Peixoto.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 20:21:24 UTC 2019 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 7.8:
 * textwrap.c, langinfo.c, hxnormalize.c: Added knowledge about
   languages that do not use spaces between words. In such languages,
   a newline should not be converted to a space in outc() in
   textwrap.c, but only to a break opportunity.
 * hxtoc.c: The element to group headings in HTML5 is called
   HGROUP, not HEADER. The heading of a section (SECTION, ARTICLE,
   etc.) need not be the first element, there may be non-header
   elements before it.
 * hxwls.c: Print "longdesc", "classid" or "codebase" in the second
   column for the corresponding attribute. Also recognize srcset
   (somewhat).
 * hxnormalize.c: Added option -X to indicate the input is XML
   instead of HTML. Handle conversion of CDATA elements to XML by
   escaping < and & instead of adding <![CDATA[. Added corresponding
   test normalize13.sh.

- Cut overly long description and trim bias.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 27 08:45:43 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 7.7:
 * dtd.hash: Don't include the arguments in the forward declaration
   of lookup_element(), because those arguments differ slightly
   depending on which version of gperf is used to generate dtd.c:
   "unsigned int" in gperf 3.0 vs "size_t" in gperf 3.1.
 * conficgure.ac: Check for libiconv with the AM_ICONV macro (from
   gettext) instead of AC_SEARCH_LIBS. (Advice from Christian
   Weisgerber, received via Anthony Bentley). That in turn requires
   adding config.rpath to the EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am.
 * hxindex.c: Replaced fgets() by getline(), to allow lines of
   arbitrary length in the term database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 18 17:03:55 UTC 2018 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- update to version 7.6:
 * fix read uninitialized memory bug
- update to version 7.5:
 * bugfixes
 * Added support for HTML5 elements (source, audio, video)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 30 11:18:16 UTC 2017 - sebix+novell.com@sebix.at

- initial package for version 7.4
