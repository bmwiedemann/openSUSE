%description
Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized
for speed, ease of use, and configurability, and designed to work well for any
kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs. Hugo takes a directory with
Markdown and templates and renders them into a full HTML website, typically in a
fraction of a second. You can run Hugo from any directory, which works well for
shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account. Hugo
provides a Privacy Config that can assist with General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) compliance issues.
