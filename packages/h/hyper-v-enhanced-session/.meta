  <description>NOTE: The package is for SUSE VM guest installs in MS Hyper-V, generally when the &quot;hyper-v&quot;[https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization/hyper-v] package is present.

* Completes pre-requisite setup for an openSUSE VM on Hyper-V to be able to use &quot;Enhanced session&quot;.
* Works with lightdm, NOT sddm. gdm isn't an issue and is difficult to remove from a Gnome install.
* In PowerShell, run 'Set-VM -VMName &amp;lt;name of vm&amp;gt; -EnhancedSessionTransportType HvSocket' to enable.
* Provides /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh.userwindowmanager-sample to use in '$HOME'.</description>
