- updated to V9_0_11 which fixes also following CVEs:
  * CVE-2021-45103
  * CVE-2021-45104
  * CVE-2022-26110
- renamed added-suse-as-SYSTEM_NAME.patch to
  added-suse-as-SYSTEM_NAME-again.patch
- Following new deature was added:
  * The condor_job_router can now create an IDTOKEN and send it them along with a
    routed job for use by the job. This is controlled by a new configuration
    variable JOB_ROUTER_CREATE_IDTOKEN_NAMES and a new route option SendIDTokens.
- update contains following bugfixes:
  * HTCondor will now properly transfer checkpoints if stream_output or
    stream_error is set and output or error, respectively, is not an absolute
    path. (HTCONDOR-736)
  * A problem where HTCondor would not create a directory on the execute node
    before trying to transfer a file into it should no longer occur. (This
    would cause the job which triggered this problem to go on hold.) One way to
    trigger this problem was by setting preserve_relative_paths and specifying
    the same directory in both transfer_input_files and
    transfer_checkpoint_files. (HTCONDOR-857)
  * The condor_annex tool no longer duplicates the first tag if given multiple
    -tag options on the command line. You can now set longer user data on the
    command-line. (HTCONDOR-910)
  * Fixed a bug in the condor_job_router that could result in routes and
    transforms substituting a default configuration value rather than the value
    from the configuration files when a route or transform was applied
    (HTCONDOR-902)
  * For batch grid universe jobs, a small default memory value is no longer
    generated when request_memory is not specified in the submit file. This
    restores the behavior in versions 9.0.1 and prior. (HTCONDOR-904)
  * Fixed a bug in the FileTransfer mechanism where URL transfers caused
    subsequent failures to report incorrect error messages. (HTCONDOR-915)
  * Fixed a bug in the condor_dagman parser which caused SUBMIT-DESCRIPTION
    statements to return an error even after parsing correctly. (HTCONDOR-928)
  * The Python bindings no longer segfault when the htcondor.Submit constructor
    is passed a dictionary with an entry whose value is None. (HTCONDOR-950)

- initial commit of htcondor stbale condor release V9_0_8 with 
  the patch added-suse-as-SYSTEM_NAME.patch so that suse can be 
  used as system for the build. The additional sources condor_config\
  and osg-env.conf are the rpm specific configurations
