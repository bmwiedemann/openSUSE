# Kubernetes Package Manager container image

![Redistributable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redistributable-Yes-green)


## Description

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a tool for managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. This container image simplifies the deployment and use of Helm by packaging it into a ready-to-use container.


## Usage

To run Helm, use the following command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -it  registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/helm:3.16 <helm-sub-command>
```

For instance, to display the Helm version, run:
```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -it registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/helm:3.16 version --template='{{.Version}}'
v3.16
```

Refer to the full list of Helm commands, flags and environment variables, in the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/).

For a comprehensive guide on getting started with Helm, refer to the [official Helm tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/).

### Connecting Helm container to the Host's Kubernetes Cluster


To interact with a Kubernetes cluster, mount the Kubernetes configuration file (`kubeconfig`) from the container host into the container (use the `--net=host` flag to allow the container to use the hostâ€™s network):

```ShellSession
$ podman run --rm -it --net=host -v /path/to/kubeconfig:/root/.kube/config:Z registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/helm:3.16
```
