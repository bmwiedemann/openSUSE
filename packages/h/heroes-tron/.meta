  <title>heroes-tron</title>
  <description>Heroes is similar to the &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;Nibbles&quot; games of yore, but includes many graphical improvements and new game features.  In it, you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own trail. Several modes of play are available, including &quot;get-all-the-bonuses&quot;, death match, and &quot;squish-the-pedestrians&quot;.</description>
