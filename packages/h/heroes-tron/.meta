  <title>Game Like Tron and Nibbles Games</title>
  <description>Heroes is similar to the &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;Nibbles&quot; games of yore, but
includes many graphical improvements and new game features.  In it, you
must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while
avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own trail.
Several modes of play are available, including &quot;get-all-the-bonuses&quot;,
death match, and &quot;squish-the-pedestrians&quot;.</description>
