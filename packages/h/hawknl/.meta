  <title>Game oriented network API</title>
  <description>HawkNL (NL) is a fairly low level API, a wrapper over Berkeley/Unix Sockets
and Winsock. But NL also provides other features including support for many OSs,
groups of sockets, socket statistics, high accuracy timer, CRC functions, macros
to read and write data to packets with endian conversion, and support for multiple
network transports.</description>
