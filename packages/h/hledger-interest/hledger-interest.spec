%description
Hledger-interest is a small command-line utility based on Simon Michael's
hleder library. Its purpose is to compute interest for a given ledger account.
Using command line flags, the program can be configured to use various schemes
for day-counting, such as act/act, 30/360, 30E/360, and 30/360isda.
Furthermore, it supports a (small) number of interest schemes, i.e.
annual interest with a fixed rate and the scheme mandated by the German BGB288
(Basiszins fuer Verbrauchergeschaefte). Extending support for other schemes is
fairly easy, but currently requires changes to the source code.

As an example, consider the following loan, stored in a file called
'test.ledger':

> 2008/09/26 Loan > Assets:Bank EUR 10000.00 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2008/11/27
Payment > Assets:Bank EUR -3771.12 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2009/05/03 Payment >
Assets:Bank EUR -1200.00 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2010/12/10 Payment >
Assets:Bank EUR -3700.00 > Liabilities:Bank

Suppose that loan earns 5% interest per year, and payments amortize interest
before amortizing the principal claim, then the resulting ledger would look
like this:

> $ hledger-interest --file=test.ledger --source=Expenses:Interest
--target=Liabilities:Bank --30-360 --annual=0.05 Liabilities:Bank > 2008/09/26
Loan > Assets:Bank EUR 10000.00 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2008/11/27 Payment >
Assets:Bank EUR -3771.12 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2008/11/27 5.00% interest for
EUR -10000.00 over 61 days > Liabilities:Bank EUR -84.72 > Expenses:Interest >
> 2008/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -6313.60 over 34 days > Liabilities:Bank
EUR -29.81 > Expenses:Interest > > 2009/05/03 Payment > Assets:Bank EUR
-1200.00 > Liabilities:Bank > > 2009/05/03 5.00% interest for EUR -6343.42 over
123 days > Liabilities:Bank EUR -108.37 > Expenses:Interest > > 2009/12/31
5.00% interest for EUR -5251.78 over 238 days > Liabilities:Bank EUR -173.60 >
Expenses:Interest > > 2010/12/10 Payment > Assets:Bank EUR -3700.00 >
Liabilities:Bank > > 2010/12/10 5.00% interest for EUR -5425.38 over 340 days >
Liabilities:Bank EUR -256.20 > Expenses:Interest > > 2010/12/31 5.00% interest
for EUR -1981.58 over 21 days > Liabilities:Bank EUR -5.78 > Expenses:Interest

Running the utility with '--help' gives a brief overview over the available
options:

> Usage: hledger-interest [OPTION...] ACCOUNT > -h --help print this message
and exit > -V --version show version number and exit > -v --verbose echo input
ledger to stdout (default) > -q --quiet don't echo input ledger to stdout >
--today compute interest up until today > -f FILE --file=FILE input ledger file
(pass '-' for stdin) > -s ACCOUNT --source=ACCOUNT interest source account > -t
ACCOUNT --target=ACCOUNT interest target account > -I --ignore-assertions
ignore any failing balance assertions > --act use 'act' day counting convention
> --30-360 use '30/360' day counting convention > --30E-360 use '30E/360' day
counting convention > --30E-360isda use '30E/360isda' day counting convention >
--constant=RATE constant interest rate > --annual-schedule=SCHEDULE schedule of
annual interest rates. > syntax: '[(Date1,Rate1),(Date2,Rate2),...]' >
--annual=RATE annual interest rate > --bgb288 compute interest according to
German BGB288.
