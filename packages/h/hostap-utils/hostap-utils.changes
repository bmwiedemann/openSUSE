Mon Sep 18 14:13:31 CEST 2006 - jg@suse.de

- hostap-utils: Fixed usage of uninitialised variable (bug 184410)
- hostapd: Update to version 0.4.9, changes:
  * added a new configuration option, eapol_version, that can be

    broken client implementations that drop EAPOL frames which use
    version number 2 [Bug 89]
  * fixed EAP-MSCHAPv2 message length validation
  * fixed stdarg use in hostapd_logger(): if both stdout and syslog
    logging was enabled, hostapd could trigger a segmentation fault
    in vsyslog on some CPU -- C library combinations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  4 17:51:44 CET 2005 - jg@suse.de

- hostapd, update to 0.4.6, changes:
  * added support for replacing user identity from EAP with RADIUS
    User-Name attribute from Access-Accept message, if that is included,
    for the RADIUS accounting messages (e.g., for EAP-PEAP/TTLS to get
    tunneled identity into accounting messages when the RADIUS server
    does not support better way of doing this with Class attribute)
  * driver_madwifi: fixed EAPOL packet receive for configuration where
     ath# is part of a bridge interface
  * added a configuration file and log analyzer script for logwatch
  * fixed EAPOL state machine step function to process all state
    transitions before processing new events; this resolves a race
    condition in which EAPOL-Start message could trigger hostapd to send
    two EAP-Response/Identity frames to the authentication server

    4-Way Handshake if WPA-PSK is used
  * fixed PMKSA caching for the case where
  * EAP-PAX is now registered as EAP type 46

    set (this was causing "wifi0: invalid skb->cb magic" errors)
  * fixed linking both hostap_cs and hostap_pci to kernel
  * filter out sequential disconnect events to make race condition with
    received EAPOL frames less likely to happen (this improves
    authentication success rate with some APs that send EAPOL frames
    very quickly after the (re)association response)
  * added support for setting channel mask for scan requests

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug  7 22:13:32 CEST 2005 - ro@suse.de

    authenticator
  * driver_madwifi: fixed pairwise key removal to allow WPA reauth
    without disassociation
  * fixed RADIUS attribute Class processing to only use
    Access-Accept packets to update Class; previously, other RADIUS
    authentication packets could have cleared Class attribute
  * fixed PMKSA caching (EAP authentication was not skipped correctly
    with the new state machine changes from IEEE 802.1X draft)
- hostap-driver: update to 0.3.9, changes:
  * fixed background scans (iwlist wlan0 scan) not to break data
    connection when in host_roaming 2 mode

- update hostap-utils to 0.2.4 (no changes)
- update hostap-driver to 0.2.4:

    did not count TX or RX at all for most cases)
  * fixed compilation with PRISM2_NO_STATION_MODES defined
  * fixed MAC address changing to update address for wifi# interface
    (without this, at least Master mode did not work correctly when
    MAC address was changed for wlan#)

    packets to unauthorized ports when IEEE 802.1X/WPA is used
  * merged CryptoAPI versions of WEP/TKIP/CCMP from the wireless-2.6
    BitKeeper tree (not used by default, can be enabled by defining
    HOSTAP_USE_CRYPTO_API)
  * fixed a buffer overflow in TKIP encryption (hostap_crypt_tkip
    module) on big endian hosts

- update to hostapd-0.1.3, changes:
  * fixed event loop to call signal handlers only after returning from
    the real signal handler
  * reset sta->timeout_next after successful association to make sure
    that the previously registered inactivity timer will not remove the

    issues with some STA firmware versions forgetting the configured
    value
  * restore retry limit after card reset

    ('-g' command line option in prism2_srec)
  * added support for merging two srec file (Primary and Secondary(STA)
    firmware) into one non-volatile (flash) download
