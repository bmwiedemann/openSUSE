%description
The Helsinki Finite-State Transducer software is intended for the
implementation of morphological analyzers and other tools which are
based on weighted and unweighted finite-state transducer technology.

%description -n libfoma-hfst0
Foma is a multi-purpose finite-state toolkit designed for
applications ranging from natural language processing and research in
automata theory. It should be upwardly compatible with Xerox xfst and
lexc, with the exception of binary file reading and writing.
