  <title>Command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer</title>
  <description>hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer.
The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping 
isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, 
ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to 
send files between a covered channel, and many other features.</description>
