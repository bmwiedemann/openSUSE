  <title>harmonic inversion solver</title>
  <description>Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the problem of harmonic inversion â€” given a discrete-time, finite-ength signal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a given bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those sinusoids.
