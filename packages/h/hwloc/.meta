  <title>Portable Hardware Locality</title>
  <description>
The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides 
a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) 
of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including 
NUMA memory nodes,  shared caches, processor sockets, processor cores
and processing units (logical processors or &quot;threads&quot;). It also gathers
various system attributes such as cache and memory information. It primarily
aims at helping applications with gathering information about modern
computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.

hwloc may display the topology in multiple convenient formats. 
It also offers a powerful programming interface (C API) to gather information 
about the hardware, bind processes, and much more.
