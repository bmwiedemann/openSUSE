# Until the following setting is changed, the HSQLDB service will not accept
# remote connections. Failing to set a value for server.address at all will
# result in the service binding itself to 0.0.0.0 and accepting remote
# connections.
#
# IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED that before doing this you alter the password of
# the default account (username "sa"). By default, no password is required
# to connect to HSQLDB with the "sa" account.
