  <description>Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the Tailscale control server. Headscale's goal is to provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for their projects and labs. It implements a narrower scope, a single Tailnet, suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source organisation.</description>
