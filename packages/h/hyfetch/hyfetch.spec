%description
HyFetch is a command line script to display information about your
Linux system, such as amount of installed packages, OS and kernel
version, active GTK theme, CPU info, and used/available memory.
It is a fork of neofetch, and adds pride flag coloration to the OS logo.

%package -n neowofetch
# version as reported by neowofetch --version
Version:        8.0.2
Summary:        CLI system information tool written in BASH
Provides:       neofetch = %{version}
Obsoletes:      neofetch < %{version}

%description -n neowofetch
Displays information about the system next to an image, the OS logo, or any
ASCII file of choice. The main purpose of Neofetch is to be used in
screenshots to show other users what OS/Distro is running, what Theme/Icons
are being used, etc.

Customizable through the use of command line flags or the user config file.
There are over 50 config options to mess around with and there's the `print_info()
function and friends which let you add your own custom info.

This is the forked version that is maintained together with hyfetch
