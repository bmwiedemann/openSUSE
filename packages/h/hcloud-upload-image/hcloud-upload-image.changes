- Update to version 1.1.0:
  * Highlights
    - Smaller Snapshots
      The root disk is now zeroed before the intend image is
      uploaded. This makes sure, that no bytes from the original
      image are stored in the compressed snapshot. Previously a
      very small uploaded image could not be smaller than ~0.42Gi,
      as that was the (compressed) size of image that the server
      was started with. Starting a server from a custom image is
      slower the larger the image is, so by having smaller images
      the servers can start faster.
      As one example: The test Talos Linux 1.10.1 x86 image was
      0.42Gi before, and now only takes up 0.2Gi.
      This only benefits images that are smaller than 0.42Gi
      compressed.
  * Features
    - smaller snapshots by zeroing disk first (#101) (fdfb284),
      closes #96
  * Bug Fixes
    - upload from local image generates broken command (#98)
      (420dcf9), closes #97
