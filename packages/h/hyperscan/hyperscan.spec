%description
Hyperscan is a multiple regex matching library. It
follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre
library, but is a standalone library with its own C API.

Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous
matching of large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular
expressions and for the matching of regular expressions across streams
of data.

Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.
