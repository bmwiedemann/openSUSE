- Update to version 4.0.0:
  + New public API to create subset plan and gather information on
    things like glyph mappings in the final subset. The plan can
    then be passed on to perform the subsetting operation.
  + Draw API for extracting glyph shapes have been extended and
    finalized and is no longer an experimental API. The draw API
    supports glyf, CFF and CFF2 glyph outlines tables, and applies
    variation settings set on the font as well as synthetic slant.
    The new public API is not backward compatible with the
    previous, non-public, experimental API.
  + The hb-view tool will use HarfBuzz draw API to render the
    glyphs instead of cairo-ft when compiled with Cairo 1.17.5 or
    newer, setting HB_DRAW environment variable to 1 or 0 will
    force using or not use the draw API, respectively.
  + The hb-shape and hb-view tools now default to using HarfBuzz’s
    own font loading functions (ot) instead of FreeType ones (ft).
    They also have a new option, --font-slant, to apply synthetic
    slant to the font.
  + HarfBuzz now supports more than 65535 (the OpenType limit)
    glyph shapes and metrics. See be-fonts/boring-expansion-spec#6
    and be-fonts/boring-expansion-spec#7 for details.
  + New API to get the dominant horizontal baseline tag for a given
    script.
  + New API to get the baseline positions from the font, and
    synthesize missing ones. As well as new API to get font metrics
    and synthesize missing ones.
  + Improvements to finding dependencies on Windows when building
    with Visual Studio.
  + New buffer flag, HB_BUFFER_FLAG_PRODUCE_UNSAFE_TO_CONCAT, that
    must be set during shaping for HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_CONCAT
    flag to be reliably produced. This is to limit the performance
    hit of producing this flag to when it is actually needed.
  + Documentation improvements.
  + New API:
    - General:

    hvar/vvar isn't present.
  + Reverted a GDEF processing regression.
  + A couple of fixes to handle OOM better.
  + Use an implementation for round that always rounds up, some
    minor fluctuations are expected on var font specially when
    hb-ot callback is used.
  + Fix an AAT's `kerx` issue on broken rendering of Devanagari
    Sangam MN.
  + Remove AAT's `lcar` table support from _get_ligature_carets
    API, not even much use on macOS installed fonts (only two
    files). GDEF support is the recommended one and expected to
    work properly after issues fixed two releases ago.
  - Minor memory fixes to handle OOM better specially in hb-ft.
  - Minor .so files versioning scheme change and remove
    stable/unstable scheme differences, was never used in practice
    (always default to stable scheme).

    meson, https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/wiki/Notes-on-migration-to-meson
    for more information.
  - Distribution package URL is changed, either use GitHub
    generated tarballs,
    `https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/archive/$pkgver.tar.gz`

    hb_font_get_ptem() and hb_ft_font_changed().
- Drop pkgconfig(gobject-2.0) BuildRequires: not needed/used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  9 21:00:13 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.1:
  + Fix "unsafe-to-break" in fallback shaping and other corner
    cases. All our tests pass with --verify now, meaning
    unsafe-to-break API works as expected.
  + Add --unicodes to hb-view / hb-shape.
  + [indic] Treat Consonant_With_Stacker as consonant.  This will
    need further tweaking.
  + hb_buffer_diff() tweaks.
- Changes from version 1.5.0:
  + Misc new API, for appending a buffer to another, and for
    comparing contents of two buffers for types of differences.
  + New "unsafe-to-break" API.  Can be used to speed up reshaping
    in line-breaking situations.  Essentially, after shaping, it
    returns positions in the input string (some of the cluster
    boundaries) that are "safe to break" in that if the text is
    segmented at that position and two sides reshaped and
    concatenated, the shaping result is exactly the same as shaping
    the text in one piece.
  + hb-view and hb-shape and hb-shape now take --verify, which
    verifies the above property.
  + Some corner cases of the implementation are still not quite
    working. Those will be fixed in subsequent releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  3 14:44:33 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

  + Implement OpenType Font Variation tables avar/fvar/HVAR/VVAR.
  + hb-shape and hb-view now accept --variations.
  + Various API additions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 11:38:22 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.1:
  + Always build and use UCDN for Unicode data by default. Reduces
    dependence on version of Unicode data in glib.
- Changes from version 1.4.0:
  + Merged "OpenType GX" branch which adds core of support for
    OpenType 1.8 Font Variations.
  + New API:
    - hb_font_set_var_coords_normalized().
    - HB_OT_LAYOUT_NO_VARIATIONS_INDEX.
    - hb_ot_layout_table_find_feature_variations().
    - hb_ot_layout_feature_with_variations_get_lookups().
    - hb_shape_plan_create2().
    - hb_shape_plan_create_cached2().
  + Currently variations in GSUB/GPOS/GDEF are fully supported, and
    no other tables are supported. In particular, fvar/avar are NOT
    supported, hence the hb_font_set_var_coords_normalized() taking
    normalized coordinates. API to take design coordinates will be
    added in the future.
  + HVAR/VVAR/MVAR support will also be added to hb-ot-font in the
    future.
  + Fix regression in GDEF glyph class processing.
  + Add decompositions for Chakma, Limbu, and Balinese in USE
    shaper.

    testing ONLY.
  + CoreText backend improvements with unreachable fonts.
  + Implement symbol fonts (cmap 3.0.0) in hb-ft and hb-ot-font.
  + Blacklist bad GDEF of more fonts (Tahoma & others).
  + Misc fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 11:48:17 UTC 2016 - idonmez@suse.com

- Update to GNOME 3.20.2 FATE#318572 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 11 12:35:50 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.6:
  + Blacklist GDEF table of another set of Times New Roman (Bold)
    Italic.
  + DirectWrite backend improvements. Note: DirectWrite backend is
    exclusively for our internal testing and should NOT be used in
    any production system whatsoever.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  8 19:08:56 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.5:
  + Fix GDEF mark-filtering-set, which was broken in 1.2.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 14:54:49 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.4:
  + Synthesize GDEF glyph class for any glyph that does not have
    one in GDEF. Hope we don't discover broken fonts that shape
    badly with this change.
  + Misc build and other minor fixes.
  + API changes: Added HB_NDEBUG. It's fine for production systems
    to define this to disable high-overhead debugging checks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  1 19:40:45 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.3:
  + Blacklist GDEF table of certain versions of Times New Roman
    (Bold) Italic, due to bug in glyph class of ASCII double-quote
    character. This should address "regression" introduced in 1.2.0
    when we switched mark zeroing in most shapers from
    BY_UNICODE_LATE to BY_GDEF_LATE. This fourth release in a week
    should finally stablize things...
  + hb-ot-font's get_glyph() implementation saw some optimizations.
    Though might be really hard to measure in real-world
    situations.
  + Also, two rather small API changes:
    - We now disable some time-consuming internal bookkeeping if
      built with NDEBUG defined. This is a first time that we use
      NDEBUG to disable debug code. If there exist production
      systems that do NOT want to enable NDEBUG, please let me know
      and I'll add HB_NDEBUG.
    - Added get_nominal_glyph() and get_variation_glyph() instead
      of get_glyph()
  + New API:
    - hb_font_get_nominal_glyph_func_t.
    - hb_font_get_variation_glyph_func_t.
    - hb_font_funcs_set_nominal_glyph_func().
    - hb_font_funcs_set_variation_glyph_func().
    - hb_font_get_nominal_glyph().
    - hb_font_get_variation_glyph().
  + Deprecated API:
    - hb_font_get_glyph_func_t.
    - hb_font_funcs_set_glyph_func().
  + Clients that implement their own font-funcs are encouraged to
    replace their get_glyph() implementation with a
    get_nominal_glyph() and get_variation_glyph() pair. The
    variation version can assume that variation_selector argument
    is not zero. Old (deprecated) functions will continue working
    indefinitely using internal gymnastics; it is just more
    efficient to use the new functions.
- Changes from version 1.2.2:
  + Fix regression with mark positioning with fonts that have
    non-zero mark advances. This was introduced in 1.2.0 while
    trying to make mark and cursive attachments to work together.
    I have partially reverted that, so this version is much more
    like what we had before. All clients who updated to 1.2.0
    should update to this version.
- Changes from version 1.2.1:
  + CoreText:
    - Fix bug with wrong scale if font scale was changed later
      (gh/libass/libass/#212).
    - Drastically speed up font initialization.
    - Fix tiny leak.
  + Group ZWJ/ZWNJ with previous syllable under cluster-level=0
    (gh/behdad/harfbuzz#217).
  + Add test/shaping/README.md about how to add tests to the suite.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 16:49:31 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add Conflicts: cantarell-fonts < 0.0.23. Previous versions of
  cantarell-fonts have a bug that harfbuzz now exposes, so add a
  conflicts to work-around that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 19 15:28:03 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.2.0:
  + Fix various issues (hangs mostly) in case of memory allocation
    failure.
  + Change mark zeroing types of most shapers from BY_UNICODE_LATE
    to BY_GDEF_LATE. This seems to be what Uniscribe does.
  + Change mark zeroing of USE shaper from NONE to BY_GDEF_EARLY.
    That's what Windows does.
  + Allow GPOS cursive connection on marks, and fix the interaction
    with mark attachment. This work resulted in some changes to how
    mark attachments work (gh#behdad/harfbuzz#211).
  + Graphite2 shaper: improved negative advance handling
    (eg. Nastaliq).
  + Add nmake-based build system for Windows.
  + Minor speedup.
  + Misc. improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 14 08:50:37 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.3:
  + Ported Indic shaper to Unicode 8.0 data.
  + Universal Shaping Engine fixes.
  + Speed up CoreText shaper when font fallback happens in
    CoreText.
  + Documentation improvements, thanks to Khaled Hosny.
  + Very rough directwrite shaper for testing.
  + Misc bug fixes.
  + API extensions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 29 19:19:10 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.2:
  + Fix badly-broken fallback shaper that affected terminology.
  + Fix y_scaling in Graphite shaper.
  + API changes: An unset glyph_h_origin() function in font-funcs
    now (sensibly) implies horizontal origin at 0,0. Ie, the nil
    callback returns true instead of false. As such,
    implementations that have a glyph_h_origin() that simply
    returns true, can remove that function with HarfBuzz >= 1.1.2.
    This results in a tiny speedup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 25 20:10:56 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.1:
  + Build fixes, specially for hb-coretext.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 13:18:12 UTC 2015 - mimi.vx@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.0:
  + Implement 'stch' stretch feature for Syriac Abbreviation Mark.
  + Disable use of decompose_compatibility() callback.
  + Implement "shaping" of various Unicode space characters, even
    if the font does not support them.
  + If font does not support U+2011 NO-BREAK HYPHEN, fallback to
    U+2010 HYPHEN.
  + Changes resulting from libFuzzer continuous fuzzing:
    - Reject font tables that need more than 8 edits.
    - Bound buffer growth during shaping to 32x.
    - Fix assertions and other issues at OOM / buffer max-growth.
  + Misc fixes and optimizations.
  + API changes: All fonts created with hb_font_create() now
    inherit from (ie. have parent) hb_font_get_empty().

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 19 14:43:00 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.6:
  + Reduce max nesting level in OT lookups from 8 to 6.
  + Fix memory access issue in ot-font.
  + Revert default load-flags of fonts created using
    hb_ft_font_create() back to FT_LOAD_DEFAULT|FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING.
    This was changed in 1.0.5, but caused major issues, so revert.
- Changes from version 1.0.5:
  + Fix multiple memory access bugs discovered using libFuzzer.
  + Misc fixes.
  + New API:
    - hb_font_set_parent().
    - hb_ft_font_[sg]et_load_flags()
      The default flags for fonts created using hb_ft_font_create()
      has changed to default to FT_LOAD_DEFAULT now. Previously it
      was defaulting to FT_LOAD_DFEAULT|FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING.
  + API changes:
    - Fonts now default to units-per-EM as their scale, instead
      of 0.
    - hb_font_create_sub_font() does NOT make parent font immutable
      anymore. hb_font_make_immutable() does.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  9 19:02:19 UTC 2015 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.4:
  + Fix minor out-of-bounds read error.

  + Uniscribe positioning fix.
- Changes from version 1.0.2:
  + Fix shaping with cluster-level > 0.
  + Fix Uniscribe backend font-size scaling.
  + Declare dependencies in harfbuzz.pc. FreeType is not declared
    though, to avoid bugs in pkg-config 0.26 with recursive
    dependencies.
  + Slightly improved debug infrastructure.  More to come later.
  + Misc build fixes.
- Changes from version 1.0.1:
  + Fix out-of-bounds access in USE shaper.

  + hb_feature_from_string() now accepts CSS
    font-feature-settings format.

    valid Unicode after hb_buffer_add_utf8/16/32 no matter how
    broken the input is.
  + Fix Mongolian Variation Selectors for fonts without GDEF.
  + Fix minor invalid buffer access.

    hb_ot_tag_to_language() now uses these instead of private tags.

  + New API:
    - hb_buffer_add_codepoints(). This does what
      hb_buffer_add_utf32() used to do, ie. no validity check on
      the input at all. add_utf32 now replaces invalid Unicode
      codepoints with the replacement character.
    - hb_buffer_set_replacement_codepoint()
    - hb_buffer_get_replacement_codepoint()
      Previously, in hb_buffer_add_utf8 and hb_buffer_add_utf16,
      when we detected broken input, we replaced that with
      (hb_codepoint_t)-1. This has changed to use U+FFFD now, but
      can be changed using these new API.
