Thu May  4 14:47:16 UTC 2023 - Andrea Manzini <andrea.manzini@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.0:
  * Significant speed ups to the fqzcomp codec via code restructuring
    and use of memory prefetch instructions. Encode is 30-40% faster
    and decode 5-8% faster.
  * Remove unused ax_with_libdeflate.m4 file from build system

- removed patch fix_ix86_build.patch already merged in upstream

- Update to 1.4.0:
  * This is almost entirely minor bug fixing with a few small updates.
  * Optimise compression / speed of the name tokeniser
  * Improvements for Intel -m32 builds, including better AVX2 validation
  * Detect Neon capability at runtime via operating system APIs.
  * Update hts_pack to operate in line with CRAMcodecs spec, where the number of symbols > 16.
  * Fixed too-stringent buffer overflow checking in O1 rans decoder.

- Update to 1.3.0:
  * The primary change in this release is a new SIMD enabled
    rANS codec.
    There is a 32-way unrolled rANS implementation. This is accessed
    using the existing rans 4x16 API with the RANS_ORDER_X32 bit set.
  * Improved memory allocation via a new htscodecs_tls_alloc function.
  * Some external functions have been renamed, with the old ones
    still existing in a deprecated fashion.
  * Improved test framework with an "entropy" tool that iterates
    over all entropy encoders.
  * Reworked fuzzing infrastructure.
  * Small speed improvements to various rANS encoders and decoders.
  * Substantial memory reduction to the name tokeniser (tok3).
  * Fixed undefined behaviour in our use of _builtin_clz().
  * Fixed a few redundant #includes.
  * Work around strict aliasing bugs, uncovered with gcc -O2.
  * Fixed an issue with encoding data blocks close to 2GB in size.
  * Fix encode error with large blocks using RANS_ORDER_STRIPE.
- Add fix_ix86_build.patch
