%description
A simple curses-style terminal user interface for the hledger accounting
system. It can be a more convenient way to browse your accounts than the CLI.
This package currently does not support Microsoft Windows, except in WSL.

hledger is a robust, cross-platform set of tools for tracking money, time, or
any other commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable file
format, with command-line, terminal and web interfaces. It is a Haskell rewrite
of Ledger, and one of the leading implementations of Plain Text Accounting.
