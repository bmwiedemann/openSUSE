  <title>IRC client based on XChat</title>
  <description>HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it’s completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source, it’s perfectly legal. For more info, please read the Shareware Background.

HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK which in turn was a successor of freakschat.</description>
