Changes for htdig:
==================

The htdig 'main' dir is now /srv/www/htdig, there is a subdir
conf where the configuration file is to be found.
/etc/htdig/htdig.conf is the htdig configuration file.

Tools like htdig, htdump, etc. are installed in /usr/bin.

The probably large databases go to /var/lib/htdig/db.

The online documentation is in /usr/share/doc/packages/htdig 
if you install the htdig-doc package.
