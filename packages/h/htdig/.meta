  <title>WWW Index and Search System</title>
  <description>The ht://Dig system is a complete World Wide Web index and search
system for a small domain or intranet. This system is not meant to
replace the need for powerful Internet-wide search systems like Lycos,
Infoseek, Webcrawler, or AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the
search needs of a single company, campus, or even a particular
subsection of a Web site.

Unlike some WAIS-based or Web server-based search engines, ht://Dig can
span several Web servers at a site. The type of these Web servers does
not matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.</description>
