  <title>HTML to PostScript Converter</title>
  <description>An HTML to PostScript converter written in Perl.  Html2ps understands
many of the HTML 4.0 features.	From the home page
(http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html):

* Many ways to control the appearance; this is mostly done using
   configuration files.

* Support for processing multiple documents, can be done
   automatically by recursively following links.

* A table of contents can be generated, either from the links in a
   document or automatically from document headings.

* Configurable page headers and footers that can, for example,
   contain document title, URL, page number, current heading, and
   date.

* Automatic hyphenation and text justification can be selected.</description>
