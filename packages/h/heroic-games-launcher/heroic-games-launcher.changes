  * Known Issues
    + We just found out that Heroic is not creating the folder 'GamesConfig' on its folder
      so this might cause some issues on clean installs. As an workaround, just create this folder under:
      - Linux: .config/heroic or .var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/config/heroic on Flatpak.
      - Windows: %APPDATA%/local/heroic
      - macOS: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/heroic
      - Or Install a game, it will show some errors, just wait until the install finished notification shows up.
        Then open the game settings.
