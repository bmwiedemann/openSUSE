- Update to  3.4.4
  * New features:
  - Added experimental support for scalable (truetype) fonts based
    on the freetype2 library. To enable this, obtain a suitable
    fixed-width font (such as Bitstream Vera Mono available from
    www.gnome.org/fonts) and add
    '-DSTROKED_FONTS=\"/path/to/this/truetype/font.ttf\"' in the
    DEFINES section of the Makefile) 
  - DXF header improved, and line width and color support added
  - Added support for the rectangle mode within PE mode
  - Added NR as another end-of-image marker in multi-image files
  - hp2xx now tries to print the offending section of the input
    file when it encounters an error.
  - Added a new commandline option, -M <pen> to redirect pen 0
    drawing commands to any other, ideally unused pen number.
    This works around the problem that redefining PC0 also changes
    the background color of raster images (but not vector files
    such as eps).
  * Bug fixes:
  - penwidth was erroneously set to the default 0.1 mm after
    drawing a label
  - xfig and rgip output did not yet handle the changed pencolor
    and width settings
  - polygons sometimes had the wrong sections filled in for some
    of the scanlines
  - forcing penwidth via the -p commandline option no longer
    worked for the conventional values between 1 and 9 
  - Simplified HPGL output could contain values in exponential
    notation (which is illegal in HPGL1)
  - Default miter limit in eps and pdf output was way too large
  - Using the -ansi compiler flag (as even suggested by the
    supplied Makefiles) could result in a broken binary (due to
    missing function prototypes) on some platforms
  - the size of the raster buffer was miscalculated in some
    circumstances
  - DT implementation was both incorrect and incomplete
  - AA with CT set to 'deviation distance' gave wrong results or
    even crashed the program
  - page counting of multi-image files was not always correct,
    rendering some images inaccessible, or causing the generation
    of blank image files)
  - SP in PE mode did not update the pen count, potentially
    resulting in color loss in the raster modes.
  - Using -h, -? or even -help for help no longer generates an
    error message before the help text is shown.
- includes 3.4.3
  * New features:
  - Raster graphics modes now use correctly scaled penwidths 
  - Added support for (most of) the LA, line attributes command
    (cap/join types best supported in eps,fig and pdf for now)
  - Added support for the CR (relative color range) command
  - Added support for the IR (input reference points as percentage
    of current limits) command
  - Added support for the OW (output clipping window) command
  - hp2xx now recognizes (and ignores) the VS command to reduce
    number of runtime warnings
  - hp2xx now ignores stray Escape characters among HPGL commands
  - EMF export is now also available as an option on non-Windows
    builds if libEMF (http://libemf.sourceforge.net) is installed
  - hp2xx now translates FP commands into EP to show the outlines
    when the -n, --nofill option is used. (Previously polygon
    commands were ignored in that case unless they contained an
    explicit EP as well. This was particularly unfortunate in the
    case of polygon-derived text)
  - Added new commandline option -e, --extraclip <unit> for
    additional margin around clip regions. Some programs apparently
    miscalculate their frames.
  - Input files containing several plots are now rendered as
    separate images, even if the -P option is not used. Output file
    names are numbered starting from the second file, i.e. file.plt
    yields file.png file.1.png file.2.png.
  - TIFF creation on stdout now uses a safer method of generating
    and accessing its temporary file on Unix.
  - Added a new output format, G-code for CNC engraving
  * Bug fixes:
  - hp2xx now ignores SC commands with invalid parameters 
  - hp2xx now ignores PS0
  - IW without parameters now does not cause clipping when P1,P2
    are still set to the 'hardware defaults'.
  - AC support in 3.4.2 slowed down the polygon fill code
  - raster mode was allocating a big 8 bit per pixel memory
    buffer even when the pen data would fit in 4bpp
  - PDF output would fold the image in some cases
  - The RO/IW fix in 3.4.2 broke other cases, fixed again.
  - The DXF header was a bit too minimalistic for some readers
  - Dots drawn for PUPDPU sequences were not clipped by IW
  - Unsupported subtypes 6 and 7 of SD and AD (weight & typeface)
    caused an error exit instead of simply being ignored
  - extremely short line segments could confuse the pattern state
    machine, resulting in no or extraneous lines being drawn
  - BP did not handle kind=5 (autorotation control). This could
    lead to misinterpretation of further arguments to BP,
    specifically title strings
  - Escape sequences inside PJL headers (two or more header lines
    starting with 'Esc-12345X') are now handled gracefully
  - Removed memory leak in the X11 previewers' zoom function
  - PDF output could omit lines in some cases
  - PM2 did not close the current polygon if necessary
  - Polygon fill range was not always initialized correctly
  - Compile fix for HPUX11 ansi compiler (add whitespace to work
    around what is probably a compiler bug)
  - Vertices of filled polygons were omitted from calculation of
    actual plot size
  - added ROWSPERSTRIP header parameter to TIFF files, as some
    programs rely on its presence 
  - Dots for PUPDPU got drawn for PDPA as well, which made
    consecutive dashed lines restart the dash pattern for each
    segment instead of carrying over the remainder of the pattern
    from the previous one. 
  - Removed the checks preventing negative or large offsets to be
    defined with the -o and -O commandline options
  - The viewbox given in the SVG header was too small
  - Closed several memory leaks (mainly important for multi-file
    operation).
  - The documentation was outdated in several aspects.
  - The SVG output used integral linewidths only roughly
    corresponding to the original values.
  - Files that explicitly asked for default arc precision (by
    providing a zero tolerance value) were not handled correctly
  - Text penwidth was always the same as that in use for
    linedrawing. This is now fixed, and the SD option for forcing
    this behaviour is now honored.
  - Some warning messages were emitted even in quiet mode.
- rebase hp2xx-3.4.2-fix.patch
- rebase hp2xx-3.4.2-png-deprecated.patch
- drop hp2xx-3.4.2-implicit-decls.patch (fixed upstream)
- add fix-stringcompare.patch (fixes rpm lint error)
