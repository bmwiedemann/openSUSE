  <title>C++ library for filezilla</title>
  <description>libfilezilla is a small and modern C++ library, offering some basic functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some of the highlights include:

    A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet extremely efficient
    Timers for periodic events
    A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy, which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
    Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O

libfilezilla is a cross-platform library for all major operating systems, including but not limited to Linux, *BSD, OS X and Windows.

This library is free software, it is distributed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License v2+
