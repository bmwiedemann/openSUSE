    <comment>Hi,

I'm submitting this small library because it is a dependency of a larger package that I want to submit to Factory:

That package is Nyxt, an innovative web browser written in Common Lisp, whose stable version 3.0.0 was just released, after 2 years of work:
https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt

I already maintain a  nyxt package in a subproject of my home repo since a while:
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:bobbie424242:nyxt
  
I'd like to get nyxt into the &quot;network&quot; devel project (and then Factory) but it depends on libfixposix, hence this request so nyxt can eventually build in the &quot;network&quot; devel project (if accepted).
