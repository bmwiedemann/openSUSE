  <title>Altivec Versions of Some libc Functions</title>
  <description>libfreevec is a free (LGPL) library with hand-optimized replacement
routines for GLIBC, such as memcpy() and strlen(). These routines have
been written specifically to take advantage of the AltiVec unit
(Velocity Engine or VMX) and will only work on processors that include
this unit. This means they will not work on older processors, such as
603, 604, 750 (G3), or the POWER family of CPUs.</description>
