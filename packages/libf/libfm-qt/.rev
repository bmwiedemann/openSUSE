    <comment>- Use LGPL-2.1-or-later AND BSD-3-Clause as license

- Move the libfm-qt Provides from the preamble to the library
  package. In the preamble it's useless, as if there was a main

  implicitly providing this capability.

- Split out data files from libfm-qt7 in order to adhere to the
  shared library packaging policy.

- Updated license in spec file

- Changed libfm-qt.keyring to tsujan's key

- Remove fix_query_cancellation_error.patch: contained in upstream
