-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 22:06:54 UTC 2021 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.3.2:
  * Fixed all/allfiles parse conditions in FmAction, it was inverted.
  * Fixed 'SelectionCount' condition parsing in FmAction if '=' was used.
  * Fix memory access error if home path == desktop path.
  * Added treating /usr/local/share/ as trusted for *.desktop files.
  * Fixed value for amount of data transferred in progress dialog.
  * Fixed preferred height in fm-cell-renderer-text.
  * Fixed search_window immediately disappearing on Wayland.
  * Changed thumbnails placement according to the XDG Base Directory
    Specification.
  * Changed xarchiver command invocation to create archive. It was incompatibly
    changed by the author in 2017.

  * Fixed memory leak on sn_id in fm-action.c.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 15 19:04:43 UTC 2019 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Removed calls to update-mime-database/update-desktop-database
  from scriptlets: They are automatically performed via RPM file
  triggers.
- Ran spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 25 12:34:06 UTC 2018 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.3.1:
  * Fixed crash on reload while directory changes (folder might be not ready yet).
  * Changed size of large thumbnails to 512 since 256*256 appears to be small on
    hi-res displays.
  * Added application/gzip to archivers.list file next to application/x-gzip.
  * Added image/x-compressed-xcf to archivers.list file for xarchiver.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 22 13:03:23 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.3.0.2:
  * Fixed launching menu entries shortcuts on desktop which was broken by making
    them all executable in 1.3.0 - those should be launchable still.
  * Fixed installing modules into non-standard path: libtool couldn't relink them
    properly.
  * Added emblem support by reading the "metadata::emblems" attribute provided by
    GFileInfo. The metadata is provided by gio/gvfs and are currently stored in
    $XDG_DATA_HOME/gvfs-metadata.
  * Fixed typo: occured -> occurred.
  * Made desktop entries treaten as executables. Now clicking on a native desktop
    file opens a confirmation dialog instead of executing it. Trashed desktop
    files are only opened as text files and desktop files under system menu
    (i.e. menu://applications/) are executed without prompt as before.
  * Fixed build error with vala 0.36.1.
  * Fixed crash on launching nonexistent link targets.
  * Added tooltips for attributes of copying files.
  * Fixed thumbnails generation for files in the thumbnails cache directory which
    actually should never be done.
  * Fixed crash on pasting large string when completion matches.
  * Prevented creation corrupted image thumbnails with gdk-pixbuf2 >= 2.36.1.
  * Fixed crash in fm_config_load_from_file().
  * Dropped displaying "extension" for a directory.
  * Fixed crash on pasting a file into the search folder, show an error message
    when the copy destination doesn't exist instead.
  * Added new API for FmAction new object type, to replace old VALA-generated
    code. New API is more convenient, C instead of VALA, and should support all
    DES-API specification features, not just limited set.
  * Migrated module 'gtk-menu-actions' to new DES-EMA actions API.
  * Added display of data transferred to progress dialog.
  * Fixed wrong names for files, copied from Google Drive and similar places.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 25 12:00:55 UTC 2016 - trcs@gmx.com

- new upstream version 1.2.5
  * Fixed 'Launch in Terminal' issue when custom args were ignored.
  * Fixed crash with non-UTF regex search pattern.
  * Added 'termite' into the terminals database.
  * Fixed possible crash on FmPlacesView.
  * Fixed crash on non-existent directory listing job.
  * Added conversion of all URIs schemes to file:/// by mapping them 
    to FUSE-mounted local paths if that is possible. This is required
    for non-gio applications to open files mounted by gvfs.
  * Added new MIME type for rar files to the archivers.list file.
  * Fixed crash in _fm_template_update().
  * Fixed incorrect initialization of FmPlacesViewClass, it should 
    not call fm_get_home_dir() but initialized with NULL, that will do
    the same at runtime.
  * Fixed FTBFS when libmenu-cache was installed to non-standard 
    location.
  * Added check for edit name "/" for remote root directory so 
    display name should be used in such cases as more sensible one.
  * Fixed wrong width requested by FmCellRendererText (1.2.4 
    regression).
  * Updated list of MIME types handled by xarchiver.
  * Don't show error message when attempting to rename file into the 
    same.
  * Fixed crash after file info job finished on a folder that already 
    left.
  * Changed limitations on libfm-pref-apps.desktop to show only in 
    LXDE.
  * Fixed incomplete file copy job pausing in some cases.
  * Fixed missing 'Empty Trash Can' option in desktop's trash context 
    menu.
  
  Changes on 1.2.4 since 1.2.3:
  
  * Fixed crash in templates on file that was deleted instantly after
    creation.
  * Fixed handling %c in desktop entry Exec key: launch may fail if 
    the application name contains spaces so it needs quoting.
  * Fixed missing folder info update on folder attributes change.
  * Use G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD on application launch, that should 
    fix a problem with pkexec.
  * Corrected missing newline at end of generated shortcut desktop 
    entry.
  * Improved file type detection, it failed in some cases such as 
    DOCX.
  * Returned back the workaround on thumbnailers which don't save any 
    of Thumb::MTime or Thumb::URI in the thumbnail.
  * Fixed wrong treating files like ".purple" as having extension 
    "purple".
  * Fixed invalid desktop entry save if 'Cancel' was pressed in the 
    file
    properties dialog window.
  * Fixed issues on dropping folders into Places for bookmarking them.
  * Fixed crash in expand_exec_macros() on missing Exec line.
  * Rewritten broken rubberband rendering in icon view for GTK3.
  * Eliminated usage of GVolumeMonitor if no FmFolder object was 
    created.
  * Fixed renaming of desktop entries on copy operation error: it was 
    the file name which was set in renaming dialog but it was 
    compared with display name instead when decided whether "Rename" 
    button should be active or not.
  * Fixed dropping files onto applications shortcuts on the desktop: 
    those should be not "inode/x-shortcut" but 
    "application/x-desktop" instead and therefore handled as any other
    applications, i.e. allow drop.
  * Added 'urxvtc' into the terminals database.
  * Fixed adding user-defined MIME associations into mimeapps.list 
    config.
  * Few UI adaptations to work with GTK+ 3.10 or newer.
  * Fixed creating shortcuts on paths with basename started with '?'.
  * Fixed pointer-related issues with GTK+ 3.10 or newer.
  * Added 'terminology' into the terminals database.
  * Fixed stuck tooltip on entering empty folder.
  * Fixed crash on cancelling FmDirListJob while retrieving is in 
    progress.
  * Fixed incomplete cleanup on folder reloading.
  * Corrected autoscrolling to position in view to not include extra 
    space (so not show all the column/row at once but only fully show 
    exactly the item). This may fix a problem with double-click at the
    end of the file name which is already visible so no scrolling is 
    needed, but if another file in the column/row has longer name then
    it could bring a scrolling of the column/row, and second click 
    lands out of item area.
  * Fixed timer shown in progress dialog, it should show 01:00, not 
    00:60.
  * Fixed stuck tooltip after right-click on file in view, seen 
    rarely.
  * Disabled following symlinked directories on recursive search, 
    that may give undesired results duplicating files and in some rare
    cases even may lead to endless recursion and endless number of 
    files found.
  * Fixed few small issues with icon view interactive search:
    + search should be not activated by space key;
    + cursor was missing in the entry.
  * Fixed the background of the name of selected file with GTK+ 3.0.
  * Fixed not-ignored invalid Path= line on launch a desktop entry.
  * Fixed testing URIs like http://some.host.com for MIME type.
  * Dropped using shortcuts to URIs like http://host/ as directories, 
    no directory should be in principle used in shortcuts.
  * Fixed possible data loss on cross-partition data movement.
  * Fixed incorrect data in the search dialog date selection window.
- Removed all the previously added patches from Git: they are all
  now included upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 14 20:22:18 UTC 2014 - trcs@gmx.com

- new upstream release 1.2.3
  * Changed licence for libfm-extra and libfm components from 
    GPL-2 to LGPL-2.1.
  * Fixed crash on dropping URL queries into some folder.
  * Fixed filename on dropping URI queries into folder: URI query 
    like http://some.site/path/query.php?new=yes&mine=0 should be 
    never saved with file name path/query.php?new=yes&mine=0 but 
    as query.php instead like all the web browsers do.
  * Disabled debug messages in XML parser, it spammed a lot.
  * Fixed content type detection which was broken in last release.
  * Fixed incorrect call to g_environ_setenv() in the terminal 
    call.
  * Replaced deprecated atk_component_get_position() calls.
  * Fixed invalid callback get_image_position() on ATK icon of 
    ExoIconView, it could loop and therefore hang the application.
  * Disabled deprecated atk_focus_tracker_notify() with new libatk.
  * Fixed installation of headers with parallel install, it could 
    create invalid symlink /usr/share/libfm/libfm in some 
    conditions.
  * Corrected handling of application launch failure - launch 
    content have to be informed about failure if startup notify id 
    was retrieved from it before.
  * Fixed usage of POSIX.1-2001 declaration `environ' with GLib < 
    2.28.
  * Fixed "out-of-tree" build (e.g. make distcheck).
  * Corrected menu cache to sync in 
    fm_app_chooser_dlg_dup_selected_app(), otherwise it would not 
    work without menu preloaded.
  * Fixed launch of applications with %f or %u argument - it 
    should launch not just first file but all of them with the 
    same command.
  * Fixed unneeded fm-folder-config save even if no changes were 
    made.
  * Fixed not updated file in FmFolder if file was not changed 
    within last 2 seconds. In case of fast download it was not 
    updated in time. This may cause a little performance issue 
    though due to thumbnails update.
  * Fixed crash if g_file_get_basename() returns NULL.
  * Fixed issue with desktop entry file selected in the 
    Application chooser dialog, it tried to execute the desktop 
    entry directly. Now it setups dialog fields from that desktop 
    entry instead.
  * Fixed problem with unwanted application substitution in the 
    Application chooser dialog: if user selected no name then no 
    replacements should be attempted.
  * Fixed default app detection in Application chooser combo box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 16:41:20 UTC 2014 - andrea@opensuse.org

- new upstream version 1.2.2.1
  * Fix installation of libfm-extra.pc file for development with 
    it.
- changes on 1.2.2 since 1.2.1:
  * Fixed display name of created shortcut after dropping from 
    another application.
  * Fixed the screen for context in fm_launch_command_simple().
  * Added KDE archiver "Ark" into archivers list.
  * Fixed parsing order of directories in XDG_DATA_DIRS and 
    XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.
  * Added a possibility for application that was started (by 
    PCManFM or any other application that uses LibFM) to never
    die after our application (i.e. its parent) was closed.
  * Fixed possible memory leak in fm_config_load_from_file().
  * Corrected g_content_type_guess() call with file sample. This 
    may help with correct file type detection.
  * When calculate total file sizes in directory, filesize of 
    directory now is skipped.
  * Fixed problem with memory consumption in case image has big 
    dimension but not so big filesize - in that case loading may 
    consume all the available memory to create bitmap. The file 
    dimensions should also be checked against thumbnail_max 
    configuration variable.
  * Fixed problem with starting custom command from application 
    selection dialog. This stopped to work with new GLib versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  3 07:35:49 UTC 2014 - trcs@gmx.com

    terminal.

    --with-gtk.
  * Fixed file renaming if it's name is illegal on destination 
    filesystem.
  * An error window after user pressed 'Cancel' on app selection 
    should be not shown anymore.
  * Fixed menu positioning if it's placed near monitor edge and 
    also on non-first monitor, also ensured menu UI update before 
    calculating its
    position.
  * Fixed cancellation of loading row after FmDirTreeView chdir.
  * The "link" mark on icons of small size (< 20 px) now scaled 
    properly.
  * Fixed positioning of search box in ExoIconView widget.
  * Fixed fm_terminal_launch(), some terminals need PWD environment 
    set.
  * Fixed invalid rubberbanding after doubleclick on ExoIconView 
    items.
  * Corrected drag cursor, it should correctly show dragged item 
    icon, not generic drag cursor.
  * Fixed crash in fm_folder_view_scroll_to_path() if path is not 
    available.
  * Fixed unitialized variable usage in folder view context menu 
    positioning code.
  * Prevented path entry from containing "(invalid encoding)" 
    string since it will prevent that path from being used.
  * Fixed path completion listing for display names in paths.
  * One-time custom application isn't added anymore into list of 
    last used.
  * Added a workaround on duplicated loop devices in Places 
    sidebar.
  * If quick_exec option is set to true, launching will always 
    start the application, not try a terminal for it.
  * Changed ExoIconView rubberbanding the same way as it's done in 
    GTK+.
  * Fixed invalid renaming files on moving them around virtual FS.
  * Fixed crash in vfs-menu module with libmenu-cache 0.3.x.
