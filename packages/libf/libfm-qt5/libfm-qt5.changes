  * Remove empty files
  * Try to refactor the emblemed icon support in a more generalized way. Reuse FolderItemDelegate to paint the emblemed icons in Fm::PlacesView to prevent code duplication. APIs changes:  * Add Fm::IconTheme::emblems() and cache emblem info in the cache.  * Add Fm::FolderItemDelegate::setFileInfoRole() and Fm::FolderItemDelegate::setFmIconRole()  * Cache multiple emblems rather than getting the first one only (but only paint the first one now).  * Remove icon sizes from Fm::PlacesModel and Fm::PlacesModelItems to maintain MVC design pattern and backward incompatibility.  * Expose two role IDs in Fm::PlacesModel: FileInfoRole and FmIconRole so the views can access these data.
  * Show File Emblems
  * Emblem For (Encrypted) Volume Icons
  * Remove cpack (#44)
  * Also Consider GEmblemedIcon (#41)
