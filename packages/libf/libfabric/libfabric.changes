-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 08:29:42 UTC 2017 - nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com

- Update to v1.5.0
  * Authorization keys Authorization keys, commonly referred to as job keys,
    are used to isolate processes from communicating with other processes
    for security purposes.
  * Multicast support Datagram endpoints can now support multicast communication.
  * (Experimental) socket-like endpoint types New FI_SOCK_STREAM and FI_SOCK_DGRAM
    endpoint types are introduced. These endpoint types target support of cloud
    and enterprise based middleware and applications.
  * Tagged atomic support Atomic operations can now target tagged receive
    buffers, in addition to RMA buffers.
  * (Experimental) deferred work queues Deferred work queues are enhanced triggerred
    operations. They target support for collective-based operations.
  * New mode bits: FI_RESTRICTED_COMP and FI_NOTIFY_FLAGS_ONLY These mode bits
    support optimized completion processing to minimize software overhead.
  * Multi-threaded error reporting Reading CQ and EQ errors now allow the application
    to provide the error buffer, eliminating the need for the application to
    synchronize between multiple threads when handling errors.
  * FI_SOURCE_ERR capability This feature allows the provider to validate and
    report the source address for any received messages.
  * FI_ADDR_STR string based addressing Applications can now request and use
    addresses provided using a standardized string format. This makes it easier
    to pass full addressing data through a command line, or handle address exchange
    through text files.
  * Communication scope capabilities: FI_LOCAL_COMM and FI_REMOTE_COMM Used to
    indicate if an application requires communication with peers on the same
    node and/or remote nodes.
  * New memory registration modes The FI_BASIC_MR and FI_SCALABLE_MR memory registration
    modes have been replaced by more refined registration mode bits. This allows
    applications to make better use of provider hardware capabilities when dealing
    with registered memory regions.
  * New mode bit: FI_CONTEXT2 Some providers need more than the size provided by the
    FI_CONTEXT mode bit setting. To accomodate such providers, an FI_CONTEXT2 mode bit
    was added. This mode bit doubles the amount of context space that an application
    allocates on behalf of the provider.
  * PSM provider notes
    * Improve the name server functionality and move to the utility code
    * Handle updated mr_mode definitions
    * Add support of 32 and 64 bit atomic values
  * PSM2 provider notes
    * Add option to adjust the locking level
    * Improve the name server functionality and move to the utility code

    * Handle updated mr_mode definitions
    * Add support for scalable endpoint
    * Add support of 32 and 64 bit atomic values

    * Improve the method of checking device existence
  * Sockets provider notes
    * Updated and enhanced atomic operation support.
    * Add support for experimental deferred work queue operations.
    * Fixed counter signaling when used with wait sets.
    * Improved support on Windows.
    * Cleaned up event reporting for destroyed endpoints.
    * Fixed several possible crash scenarios.
    * Fixed handling socket disconnect events which could hang the provider.
  * UDP provider notes
    * Add support for multicast data transfers
  * Verbs provider notes
    * Fix an issue where if the user requests higher values for tx, rx
      context sizes than default it wasn't honored.
    * Introduce env variables for setting default tx, rx context sizes and iov limits.
    * Report correct completion ordering supported by MSG endpoints.

  (fate#321883)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 16 13:12:14 CET 2017 - ndas@suse.de

- Updated to version 1.4.0 for general stability(fate#321883)
- Summary of changes as follow: 
 - Add new options, `-f` and `-d`, to fi_info that can be used to
  specify hints about the fabric and domain name. Change port to `-P`
  and provider to `-p` to be more in line with fi_pingpong.

 *GNI provider notes

	- General bug fixes, plugged memory leaks, performance improvements,
  	  improved error handling and warning messages, etc.
	- Additional API support:
    - FI_THREAD_COMPLETION
    - FI_RMA_EVENT
    - iov length up to 8 for messaging data transfers

 *PSM provider notes

	- General bug fixes
	- Use utility provider for EQ, wait object, and poll set
	- Allow multi-recv to post buffer larger than message size limit

 *PSM2 provider notes

	- General bug fixes
    - Add support for multi-iov RMA read and aromic operations
    - Allow multi-recv to post buffer larger than message size limit


 *Verbs provider notes

	- Add fork support. It is enabled by default and can be turned off by
	setting the FI_FORK_UNSAFE variable to "yes". This can improve
	performance of memory registrations but also makes fork unsafe. The
	following are the limitations of fork support:
  	- Fabric resources like endpoint, CQ, EQ, etc. should not be used in
    the forked process.
  	- The memory registered using fi_mr_reg has to be page aligned since
    ibv_reg_mr marks the entire page that a memory region belongs to
    as not to be re-mapped when the process is forked (MADV_DONTFORK).
