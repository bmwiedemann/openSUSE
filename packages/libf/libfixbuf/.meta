  <title>Implementation of the IPFIX Protocol as a C library</title>
  <description>libfixbuf is a compliant implementation of the IPFIX Protocol, as defined in
RFC 5101. It supports the information model defined in RFC 5102, extended as
proposed by RFC 5103 to support information elements for representing biflows.
libfixbuf supports UDP, TCP, SCTP, TLS over TCP, and Spread as transport
protocols. It also supports operation as an IPFIX File Writer or IPFIX File
Reader.

ipfixDump is a command line tool for printing the contents of an IPFIX
file as text.
