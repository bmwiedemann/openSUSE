# This is a useful command-line script through which one can use the
# macros from mingw64-macros.mingw64 cross-compilation.
#
# It supports the environment variable MINGW64_MACROS=<value> to be
# able to override individual rpm macros. With 
# 
#   MINGW64_MACROS='__cmake ~/bin/cmake' mingw64-cmake
# 
# for example, the specified cmake executable is used instead of
# the internal default.
