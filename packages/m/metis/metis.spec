%description
METIS is a family of programs for partitioning unstructured graphs and hypergraph
and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. The underlying algorithms
used by METIS are based on a multilevel paradigm that, at the time, had been
shown to produce quality results and scale to large problems.
