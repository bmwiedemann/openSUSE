  <title>Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering</title>
  <description>METIS is a family of programs for partitioning unstructured graphs and hypergraph and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. The underlying algorithms used by METIS are based on the state-of-the-art multilevel paradigm that has been
shown to produce high quality results and scale to very large problems. </description>
