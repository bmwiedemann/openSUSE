Wed Feb 12 01:19:50 UTC 2025 - Sean Baggaley <me@drinkybird.net>

- Update to version 1.2.0.
  * Drop support for Python 3.8.
- Changes from version 1.2.0b1:
  * Change the defaults for hggit.usephases; similar to Mercurial,
    remote repositories now default to publishing.
  * Add support for a git.blame.ignoreRevsFile configuration
    setting, that works similarly to the setting for git blame.
  * Add limited and experimental support for including hg-git metadata
    in Mercurial bundles and when pulling or pushing from remote
    Mercurial repositories, see below. (#156)
  * hg git-cleanup now also removes broken Git refs.
  * Always pull any annotated tags pointing to any known commits,
    equivalent to passing the --tags option in Git. Previously, such
    tags would only be pulled when either not using --rev or
    similar, or when listing the tag explicitly.
  * Transparently compress the objects when pushing (or exporting) to
    Git. This is done in background threads, and by default uses up to
    either four of them or the system CPU count, whichever is lower. The
    hggit.threads configuration option allows adjusting the default.
- Changes from version 1.1.4:
  * Mark Dulwich 0.22.0 as fully supported; the differences are assumed
    intentional for now.
  * Mark Mercurial 6.9 as tested and supported.
  * Fix tests with Python 3.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 12 18:51:43 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Use existing python RPM macros instead of custom ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 11 18:32:08 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Update to version 1.1.3.
  * Mark Dulwich 0.22.0 and 0.22.1 as unsupported. The compatibility hack didn't work in practice.
  * Mark Mercurial 6.8 as tested and supported.
- Changes from version 1.1.2:
  * Always advance draft phase, even if pulling from an explicit URL that isn't a named path.
  * Always save Git tags into the local, cached Git repository.
  * Add support for Dulwich 0.22.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 18 01:26:08 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Build package with Python 3.11 on Leap 15.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 17:49:36 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Update to version 1.1.1.
  * Fix pulling after marking the tip as obsolete.
  * Mark Mercurial 6.7 as supported.
- Changes from 1.1.0:
  * Remove some compatibility for now-unsupported versions of Dulwich.
- Changes from 1.1.0b1:
  * The gclear command is inherently dangerous, and has been
    replaced with a debug command instead.
  * The .hgsub and .gitmodules files are no longer retained when
    pushing to or pulling from Git, respectively. Instead, changes to
    each will be applied during the conversion.
  * Minor adjustments to categorisation of internal commands, and ensure
    that they all start with git-*.
  * Move configuration from the README file to contained within the
    extension, so that it is now self-documenting like Mercurial.
  * The -B/--bookmark flag for push will now restrict bookmarks
    by name rather than revision. (Please note that this is unsupported
    when the git.branch_bookmark_suffix configuration option is
    set.)
  * Pushing an unknown bookmark with the -B/--bookmark option now
    has the same effect as when pushing to a Mercurial repository, and
    will delete the remote Git branch.
  * You can now specify what to publish with the paths section.
  * Pushing and pulling from Git now triggers incoming, outgoing
    and changegroup hooks, along with the corresponding pre*
    hooks. In addition, the gitexport and gitimport hooks allow
    intercepting when commits are converted. As a result, you can now
    use the notify extension when interacting with Git repositories.
    (#402)
  * Git subrepositories will now be pushed as Git submodules.
- Changes from 1.0.4:
  * Address regression with Mercurial 6.4 and later where remote tags
    weren't updated on push.

  This is a minor release, focusing on bugs and compatibility.

  * Support reading remote refs even if packed.
