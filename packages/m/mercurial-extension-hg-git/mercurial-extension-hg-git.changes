Tue Jun 18 01:26:08 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Build package with Python 3.11 on Leap 15.6.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 17:49:36 UTC 2024 - Lukas Müller <expeehaa@outlook.com>

- Update to version 1.1.1.
  * Fix pulling after marking the tip as obsolete.
  * Mark Mercurial 6.7 as supported.
- Changes from 1.1.0:
  * Remove some compatibility for now-unsupported versions of Dulwich.
- Changes from 1.1.0b1:
  * The gclear command is inherently dangerous, and has been
    replaced with a debug command instead.
  * The .hgsub and .gitmodules files are no longer retained when
    pushing to or pulling from Git, respectively. Instead, changes to
    each will be applied during the conversion.
  * Minor adjustments to categorisation of internal commands, and ensure
    that they all start with git-*.
  * Move configuration from the README file to contained within the
    extension, so that it is now self-documenting like Mercurial.
  * The -B/--bookmark flag for push will now restrict bookmarks
    by name rather than revision. (Please note that this is unsupported
    when the git.branch_bookmark_suffix configuration option is
    set.)
  * Pushing an unknown bookmark with the -B/--bookmark option now
    has the same effect as when pushing to a Mercurial repository, and
    will delete the remote Git branch.
  * You can now specify what to publish with the paths section.
  * Pushing and pulling from Git now triggers incoming, outgoing
    and changegroup hooks, along with the corresponding pre*
    hooks. In addition, the gitexport and gitimport hooks allow
    intercepting when commits are converted. As a result, you can now
    use the notify extension when interacting with Git repositories.
    (#402)
  * Git subrepositories will now be pushed as Git submodules.
- Changes from 1.0.4:
  * Address regression with Mercurial 6.4 and later where remote tags
    weren't updated on push.

  This is a minor release, focusing on bugs and compatibility.

  * Fix tests with Mercurial 6.5
  * Handle failures to save refs, such as when they use characters
    forbidden by the file system; this is most easily noticed on Windows
    and macOS. (#397)

  * Support reading remote refs even if packed.
