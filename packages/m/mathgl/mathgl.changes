    for keeping plot settings, simplifying external scripts and
    capture it in GUI.

    arbitrary points.
  * Allow background for scaling image, centering image and
    tessellate image as mosaic.

  * Allow masks for candle, area, region, bars, barh, chart, tape,
    face, polygon, ellipse, rhomb.

  * Minor bugfixes.
  * OBSOLETE: Qt4 interface will be disabled in the next release.
  * OBSOLETE: Functions colorbar will have extra argument opt for
    options, similarly to axis and other plotting functions. In
    C++ and SWIG-based interfaces this change "masked" by
    providing the default value for the argument.

  * INCOMPATIBLE: Formally pure C interface handle complex numbers
    by new way due to strict following of C/C++ standards.
    However, the MathGL library is binary compatible with previous
    version(s).

  for all openSUSE versions; package it using %%doc.

- Update to version 2.3.5.1:
  + Library libmgl-qt is removed. You need to use libmgl-qt4 or
    libmgl-qt5 explicitly now.
  + Compatibility changes for latest MS VisualStudio.
  + Bugfixes.
- Changes from version 2.3.5:
  + See Changelog.txt for list of changes.
- Rebase mathgl-examples-install.patch for updated version.
- Define a macro for deciding whether to enable octave bindings,
  but disable octave bindings for all openSUSE versions for now
  as mathgl fails to build with updated octave. This is a
  temporary workaround, and once the build issue is fixed, we
  should revert back to enabling octave for recent openSUSE
  versions. The "enable_octave" macro is defined with this in
  mind.
- Add rpmlintrc file to suppress warning of missing man pages for
  the example binaries. These just clutter up the rpmlint log and
  have no practical use.
