%description
MySQL Connector/C++ is a library for applications written in C or C++ that
communicate with MySQL database servers. Version 8.0 of Connector/C++
implements three different APIs which can be used by applications:

* The new X DevAPI for applications written in C++.
* The new X DevAPI for C for applications written in plain C.
* The legacy JDBC4-based API also implemented in version 1.1 of the connector.

The Driver for C++ is designed to work best with MySQL 5.1 or later. Note - its
full functionality is not available when connecting to MySQL 5.0. You cannot
connect to MySQL 4.1 or earlier.

MySQL Connector/C++ API is a MySQL database connector for C++ development. The
MySQL driver for C++ can be used to connect to MySQL from C++ applications. The
driver mimics the JDBC 4.0 API. It implements a significant subset of JDBC 4.0.

The Driver for C++ is designed to work best with MySQL 5.1 or later. Note - its
full functionality is not available when connecting to MySQL 5.0. You cannot
connect to MySQL 4.1 or earlier.

MySQL Connector/C++ 8.0 implements the X DevAPI. The X DevAPI allows one to work
with MySQL Servers implementing a document store via the X Plugin. One can also
execute plain SQL queries using this API.

The Driver for C++ is designed to work best with MySQL 5.1 or later. Note - its
full functionality is not available when connecting to MySQL 5.0. You cannot
