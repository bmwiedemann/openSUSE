- Update to make 4.4
  * WARNING: Future backward-incompatibility!
    In the NEXT release of GNU Make, pattern rules will implement the same
    behavior change for multiple targets as explicit grouped targets
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    GNU Make now uses temporary files in more situations than previous releases.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously each target in a explicit grouped target rule was considered
    individually: if the targets needed by the build were not out of date the
    recipe was not run even if other targets in the group were out of date.  Now
    if any of the grouped targets are needed by the build, then if any of the
    grouped targets are out of date the recipe is run and all targets in the
    group are considered updated.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously if --no-print-directory was seen anywhere in the environment or
    command line it would take precedence over any --print-directory.  Now, the
    last setting of directory printing options seen will be used, so a command
    line such as "--no-print-directory -w" _will_ show directory entry/exits.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously the order in which makefiles were remade was not explicitly
    stated, but it was (roughly) the inverse of the order in which they were
    processed by make.  In this release, the order in which makefiles are
    rebuilt is the same order in which make processed them, and this is defined
    to be true in the GNU Make manual.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously only simple (one-letter) options were added to the MAKEFLAGS
    variable that was visible while parsing makefiles.  Now, all options are
    available in MAKEFLAGS.  If you want to check MAKEFLAGS for a one-letter
    option, expanding "$(firstword -$(MAKEFLAGS))" is a reliable way to return
    the set of one-letter options which can be examined via findstring, etc.
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously makefile variables marked as export were not exported to commands
    started by the $(shell ...) function.  Now, all exported variables are
    exported to $(shell ...).  If this leads to recursion during expansion, then
    for backward-compatibility the value from the original environment is used.
    To detect this change search for 'shell-export' in the .FEATURES variable.
  * WARNING: New build requirement
    GNU Make utilizes facilities from GNU Gnulib: Gnulib requires certain C99
    features in the C compiler and so these features are required by GNU Make:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/C99-features-assumed.html
    The configure script should verify the compiler has these features.
  * New feature: The .WAIT special target
    If the .WAIT target appears between two prerequisites of a target, then
    GNU Make will wait for all of the targets to the left of .WAIT in the list
    to complete before starting any of the targets to the right of .WAIT.
  * New feature: .NOTPARALLEL accepts prerequisites
    If the .NOTPARALLEL special target has prerequisites then all prerequisites
    of those targets will be run serially (as if .WAIT was specified between
    each prerequisite).
  * New feature: The .NOTINTERMEDIATE special target
    .NOTINTERMEDIATE disables intermediate behavior for specific files, for all
    files built using a pattern, or for the entire makefile.
  * New feature: The $(let ...) function
    This function allows user-defined functions to define a set of local
    variables: values can be assigned to these variables from within the
    user-defined function and they will not impact global variable assignments.
  * New feature: The $(intcmp ...) function
    This function allows conditional evaluation controlled by a numerical
    comparison.
  * New feature: Improved support for -l / --load-average
    On systems that provide /proc/loadavg (Linux), GNU Make will use it to
    determine the number of runnable jobs and use this as the current load,
    avoiding the need for heuristics.
  * New feature: The --shuffle command line option
    This option reorders goals and prerequisites to simulate non-determinism
    that may be seen using parallel build.  Shuffle mode allows a form of "fuzz
    testing" of parallel builds to verify that all prerequisites are correctly
    described in the makefile.
  * New feature: The --jobserver-style command line option and named pipes
    A new jobserver method is used on systems where mkfifo(3) is supported.
  * GNU Make has sometimes chosen unexpected, and sub-optimal, chains of
    implicit rules due to the definition of "ought to exist" in the implicit
    rule search algorithm, which considered any prerequisite mentioned in the
    makefile as "ought to exist".  This algorithm has been modified to prefer
    prerequisites mentioned explicitly in the target being built and only if
    that results in no matching rule, will GNU Make consider prerequisites
    mentioned in other targets as "ought to exist".
  * GNU Make was performing secondary expansion of all targets, even targets
    which didn't need to be considered during the build.  In this release
    only targets which are considered will be secondarily expanded.
  * If the MAKEFLAGS variable is modified in a makefile, it will be re-parsed
    immediately rather than after all makefiles have been read.
  * The -I option accepts an argument "-" (e.g., "-I-") which means "reset the
    list of search directories to empty".
  * New debug option "print" will show the recipe to be run, even when silent
    mode is set, and new debug option "why" will show why a target is rebuilt
    (which prerequisites caused the target to be considered out of date).
  * The existing --trace option is made equivalent to --debug=print,why
  * Target-specific variables can now be marked "unexport".
  * Exporting / unexporting target-specific variables is handled correctly, so
    that the attribute of the most specific variable setting is used.
  * Special targets like .POSIX are detected upon definition, ensuring that any
    change in behavior takes effect immediately, before the next line is parsed.
  * When the pipe-based jobserver is enabled and GNU Make decides it is invoking
    a non-make sub-process and closes the jobserver pipes, it will now add a new
    option to the MAKEFLAGS environment variable that disables the jobserver.
  * A long-standing issue with the directory cache has been resolved: changes
    made as a side-effect of some other target's recipe are now noticed as
    expected.

- Update to make 4.3
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Number signs (#) appearing inside a macro reference or function
    invocation no longer introduce comments and should not be escaped with
    backslashes
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Previously appending using '+=' to an empty variable would result in a
    value starting with a space
  * NOTE: Deprecated behavior.
    Contrary to the documentation, suffix rules with prerequisites are being
    treated BOTH as simple targets AND as pattern rules
  * New feature: Grouped explicit targets
  * New feature: .EXTRA_PREREQS variable
  * Makefiles can now specify the '-j' option in their MAKEFLAGS variable
    and this will cause make to enable that parallelism mode
  * Error messages printed when invoking non-existent commands have been
    cleaned up and made consistent.
  * A new option --no-silent has been added, that cancels the effect of
    the -s/--silent/--quiet flag

  * see details in NEWS and ChangeLog files 
  * Bugfixes, a complete list of bugs fixed in this version is
    available here
    http://sv.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?group=make&report_id=111&fix_release_id=101&set=custom
  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility! backslash/newline handling
  * New feature: GNU Guile integration
  * New command line option: --output-sync (-O) enables grouping of
    output by target or by recursive make.
  * New command line option: --trace enables tracing of targets.
  * New command line option argument: --debug now accepts a "n"
    (none) flag which disables all debugging settings that are
    currently enabled.
  * New feature: The "job server" capability is now supported on
    Windows.
  * New feature: The .ONESHELL capability is now supported on
    Windows.
  * New feature: "!=" shell assignment operator as an alternative
    to the $(shell ...) function.  Implemented for compatibility
    with BSD makefiles.
  * New feature: "::=" simple assignment operator as defined by
    POSIX in 2012.
  * New feature: Loadable objects
  * New function: $(file ...) writes to a file.
  * New variable: $(GNUMAKEFLAGS) will be parsed for make flags,
    just like MAKEFLAGS is.  It can be set in the environment or
    the makefile, containing GNU make-specific flags to allow your
    makefile to be portable to other versions of make.
  * New variable: `MAKE_HOST' gives the name of the host
    architecture make was compiled for.
  * Behavior of MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS is more rigorously defined.
  * Setting the -r and -R options in MAKEFLAGS inside a makefile
    now works as expected, removing all built-in rules and
    variables, respectively.
  * If a recipe fails, the makefile name and linenumber of the
    recipe are shown.
  * A .RECIPEPREFIX setting is remembered per-recipe and variables
    expanded in that recipe also use that recipe prefix setting.
  * In -p output, .RECIPEPREFIX settings are shown and all
    target-specific variables are output as if in a makefile,
    instead of as comments.
  * On MS-Windows, recipes that use ".." quoting will no longer force
    invocation of commands via temporary batch files.
