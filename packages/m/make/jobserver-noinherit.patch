Subject: [PATCH] [SV 58232] Disable inheritance of jobserver FDs for recursive
 make

A parent make will invoke a sub-make with close-on-exec disabled for
the jobserver pipe FDs.  Force close-on-exec to be to be enabled in
the sub-make so the pipe is not always passed to child jobs.

I have a test case which, when invoked with a suitable -j switch,
will hang if the recipe inherits the jobserver pipe.  This test case
was inspired by a real world case in which testing GDB on Fedora
would hang due to some poorly written test GDB cases having been
passed the jobserver file descriptors.

* src/posixos.c (jobserver_parse_auth): Call fd_noinherit() for
jobserver pipe descriptors.
