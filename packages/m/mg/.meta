  <description>Mg is a Micro Emacs clone created in 1987, based on the original MicroEMACS v30 released by Dave Conroy in 1985. The name, &quot;Micro GNU Emacs&quot;, was disputed early on by the FSF, so today it simply goes by mg. This software is fully free and in the public domain.</description>
