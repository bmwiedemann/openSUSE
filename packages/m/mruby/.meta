  <title>Lightweight Ruby</title>
  <description>mruby is the lightweight implementation of the Ruby language complying to (part
of) the ISO standard.

mruby can be linked and embedded within your application.

We provide the interpreter program &quot;mruby&quot; and the interactive mruby shell
&quot;mirb&quot; as examples.

You can also compile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the mruby
compiler &quot;mrbc&quot;.

The &quot;mrbc&quot; is also able to generate compiled byte code in a C source file.
