mimetic is an Email library (MIME) written in C++ designed to be easy to use and integrate but
yet fast and efficient.

It has been built around the standard lib. This means that you'll not find yet another string class
or list implementation and that you'll feel comfortable in using this library from the very first time.

Most classes functionalities and behavior will be clear if you ever studied MIME and its components;
if you don't know anything about Internet messages you'll probably want to read
some RFCs to understand the topic and, therefore, easily use the library whose names,
whenever possible, overlap terms adopted in the standard RFC documents.
At the very least: RFC 822, RFC 2045 and RFC 2046.
