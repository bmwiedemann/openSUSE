  <title>MagicPoint, an X Window System Presentation Tool</title>
  <description>MagicPoint is an X Window System presentation tool. It is designed to
make simple presentations easy while making complicated presentations
possible. Its presentation file (the suffix is typically .mgp) is plain
text so that you can create presentation files quickly with your
favorite editor (Emacs, for example). The package also includes the
tools mgp2html, mgp2ps, and mgp2latex, which convert mgp presentations
into other file formats.</description>
