XFT2 SUPPORT AND BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
=======================================

In the current version of magicpoint (1.10a), XFT2 mode is selected as
default.  When you show old mgp files with freetype support, pass -xxft
option to suppress the XFT2 support.  Otherwise it might not display
fonts correctly.  Most of sample mgp files in sample directory need
this option.
