- bump to 1.01
    - Keyboard shortcuts can now be edited from MComix' preference dialog
      in a new tab "Shortcuts". (by Valentin Gologuzov)
      Please not that the arrow keys, Backspace and Escape cannot be bound
      to actions right now, unless you're manually editing the config file.

    - During database upgrade, MComix did not consider that books in the
      "Last read" database might no longer exist, leading to program crash.
      This has been fixed.

    - Adding a collection with a numeric name to the library made the library
      unusable. This has been fixed.

    - Fixed win32 builds missing the 'calendar' module.

    - Fixed bookmarks not being displayed in the Ubuntu Unity global menu.

    - Fixed 'Continue reading' not working when files are opened from
      the command line (by Boris Bogar).

    - Improved page extraction and caching algorithm, leading to much better
      responsiveness, especially for viewing large archives. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - MComix will now always hide the mouse cursor after a period of
      inactivity, even when not in fullscreen mode. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - The ALT+Left and ALT+Right keys will now either advance one page,
      or go back one page, depending on the user being in manga mode.

    - CTRL plus mouse wheel will now zoom in/out one level.

    - Manual zooming will now use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear
      spline.

    - The library will now use natural sorting for "Sort by name" and
      "Sort by path" instead of alphanumeric sorting, bringing it in line
      with most other sorting done by MComix.

    - Adding a book to a collection with the same book already existing
      in another collection did not immediately show the book in the
      library main view when the new collection was already selected.

    - MComix can now use the '7z' executable to read .tar.xz and .tar.lzma
      archives.

    - ZIP archives using BZIP2 compression will now fall back to external
      unzip/7z instead of failing (by Awad Mackie).

    - MComix can now read PDF files using tools provided by mupdf,
      namely mutool and mudraw. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - MComix will now use the current GTK theme's icons for
      Next/Previous buttons.

    - Added AppData meta information for software repositories.

    - Updated traditional Chinese translation (by Wayne Su).
