  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
- Changes from version 1.20.0:
  + API:
    - New 'Modem.Sar' interface to allow the host to manage the SAR
      power level.
    - New 'Modem.GetCellInfo()' method, that allows querying
      information about the current serving and neighboring cells.
      Currently including 'cell-type' and 'serving' fields for all
      cell types, plus additional type-specific fields:
      . CDMA: 'nid', 'sid', 'base-station-id', 'ref-pn' and
        'pilot-strength'.
      . GSM: 'operator-id', 'lac', 'ci', 'timing-advance', 'arfcn',
        'base-station-id' and 'rx-level'.
      . UMTS: 'operator-id', 'lac', 'ci', 'frequency-fdd-ul',
        'frequency-fdd-dl', 'frequency-tdd', 'uarfcn', 'psc',
        'rscp', 'ecio' and 'path-loss'.
      . TDSCDMA: 'operator-id', 'lac', 'ci', 'uarfcn',
        'cell-parameter-id', 'timing-advance', 'rscp' and
        'path-loss'.
      . LTE: 'operator-id', 'tac', 'ci', 'physical-ci', 'earfcn',
        'rsrp', 'rsrq' and 'timing-advance'.
      . 5GNR: 'operator-id', 'tac', 'ci', 'physical-ci', 'nrarfcn',
        'rsrp', 'rsrq', 'sinr' and 'timing-advance'.
    - New 'access-type-preference', 'roaming-allowance',
      'profile-name', 'profile-enabled' and 'profile-source'
      fields in the 'Bearer.Properties' property, that can also be
      used in both 'Modem.Simple.Connect()' and
      'Modem.CreateBearer()'.
    - New 'Modem.Modem3gpp.SetPacketServiceState()' method and
      'Modem.Modem3gpp.PacketServiceState' property, which allow
      management the explicit attach or detach to packet service on
      the current registered network.
    - New 'Modem.Modem3gpp.SetNr5gRegistrationSettings()' method
      and 'Modem.Modem3gpp.Nr5gRegistrationSettings' property, to
      allow management of 5G specific settings like 'mico-mode' or
      'drx-cycle'.
    - New 'start-date', 'uplink-speed' and 'downlnk-speed' fields
      in the 'Bearer.Stats' property.
    - New 'Bearer.ReloadStatsSupported' property to indicate
      whether reloading ongoing stats is supported or not.
    - New 'Modem.Modem3gppProfileManager.IndexField' property, to
      indicate which field is to be used as unique index in the
      profile management operations.
    - New 'Sim.SimType', 'Sim.EsimStatus' and 'Sim.Removability'
      properties to improve the management of eSIM related
      operations.
    - New 'Sim.Gid1' and 'Sim.Gid2' properties, which allow
      identifying SIM cards that should have different settings
      applied.
    - New 'Modem.Signal.SetupThresholds() method,
      'Modem.Signal.RssiThreshold' and
      'Modem.Signal.ErrorRateThreshold' to allow configuring
      thresholds so that the modem emits indications whenever the
      signal quality values change based on those thresholds. For
      RSSI a delta amount of dBm can be given, and for error rate
      just a boolean to enable or disable the corresponding event.
    - New 'error-rate' fields in the 'Modem.Signal.Cdma',
      'Modem.Signal.Evdo', 'Modem.Signal.Gsm', 'Modem.Signal.Umts',
      'Modem.Signal.Lte' and 'Modem.Signal.Nr5g' properties.
  + Core:
    - Detecting an eSIM without an active profile in the current
      SIM slot will lead to the modem being in Failed state, in the
      same way as if the slot was for a physical SIM and no SIM was
      inserted.
    - Default amount of AT probing attempts is updated to 6, to
      cope with modems that are slower to boot.
    - New '--test-mbimex-profile-management' option in the daemon,
      to enable support for profile management operations using the
      Microsoft extensions. This is an optional feature because it
      requires using the 'apn-type' field as unique index, which
      not all users of the profile management API may expect.
    - Implemented some initial support to automatically hide
      personal details (e.g. phone numbers, SMS contents...) from
      logs, right now only applicable to QMI and MBIM logs. Updated
      support for this feature will keep on being integrated in
      future 1.20.x updates. The new '--log-personal-info' option
      in the daemon allows to disable this feature completely.
    - Added new filter match option for subsystem vendor id,
      required in several PCI based Qualcomm modules.
    - QCDM port probing will no longer automatically run for all
      plugins, only in those that explicitly require it.
    - Implemented support for suspend/resume detection based on
      ChromeOS' powerd daemon.
    - Added Cat-M and NB-IoT LPWA access technologies.
  + Modem interface: On 3GPP+3GPP2 multimode devices, a missing SIM
    card will now force the modem into Failed state, as if it was a
    3GPP-only device.
  + Simple interface: Explicitly wait for PS domain to be attached
    during a connection attempt.
  + 3GPP interface: Updated to report domain registration changes
    altogether whenever possible (e.g. when using the QMI or MBIM
    protocols).
  + MBIM:
    - Implemented support to use the Microsoft-defined MBIM
      extensions v2 and v3 whenever supported by the device. The
      ModemManager daemon will negotiate which version to use with
      the modem, so that the highest version supported is enabled.
      This negotiation applies to the whole device, so any other
      user of the MBIM device will automatically start using the
      newly agreed version.
    - Implemented current modes switching using MBIMEx v2.0
      extensions.
    - Trigger explicit disconnection if a connection attempt fails.
    - Modem will be flagged as unusable if 10 consecutive MBIM
      requests timeout.
    - Enabled multiplex support for devices in the WWAN subsystem.
  + QMI:
    - Updated logic to by default prefer 'Signal Info' over the
      deprecated 'Signal Strength' operations.
    - Updated logic to by default prefer 'System Info' over the
      deprecated 'Serving System' operations.
    - Updated power state transition logic to ensure the new state
      is reached before returning success to the user.
    - Implemented support for the 'Modem3gppProfileManager.Updated'
      signal using PDC refresh notifications.
    - Modem will be flagged as unusable if 10 consecutive QMI
      requests timeout.
    - Implemented DTMF support.
    - Implemented support for automatic SIM IMSI switch detection
      under certain roaming scenarios.
    - Updated the logic to move the PS domain state to 'registered'
      based on the DSD System Status indications.
    - Updated endpoint type detection logic to be based on the net
      driver.
    - Updated endpoint number selection to be based on the data
      port.
    - Updated connection logic to allocate separate WDS clients per
      endpoint.
    - Added support for PCO reporting.
  + plugins:
    - quectel: Added FCC unlock support for the EM05-G.
    - telit:
      . Band management updated to prefer using QMI whenever
        available, as well as to detect the #BND command format
        automatically.
      . Added support for LPWA modems.
    - fibocom:
      . Implemented optional support to power down and up the modem
        during the update of the initial EPS bearer settings.
      . Implemented initial EPS bearer settings management in the
        MA510.
    - intel: New generic plugin for Intel PCI devices with vid
      0x8086.
    - xmm: Prefer GNSS control ports explicitly tagged via udev
      tags.
    - foxconn: Use the new FOX QMI service to load firmware
      version.
    - cinterion: Added support for PCIe based devices.
- Use ldconfig_scriptlets macro.
- Switch to meson buildsystem, add meson BuildRequires and macros.
- Add xsltproc and pkgconfig(bash-completion) BuildRequires: New
  dependencies.

    connect/disconnect events. This dispatcher will make the netifd
    integration in openwrt work much better, as we'll be able to
    report network-initiated disconnections cleanly to netifd.
    There are no default connection status dispatcher scripts
    installed, but it's suggested distributions make sure the
    following directories exist:
    - ${sysconfdir}/ModemManager/connection.d/
    - ${libdir}/ModemManager/connection.d/

Wed Jun  8 11:01:59 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Enable QRTR support
  * Add BR pkgconfig(qrtr-glib)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 14:32:32 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.18.6:
  + The ModemManager.service file for systemd integration provided
    in the sources is updated as follows:
    ++ 'CAP_NET_ADMIN' is now required in the
       'CapabilityBoundingSet' field.
    ++ 'AF_NETLINK' and 'AF_QIPCRTR' are now required in the
       'RestrictAddressFamilies' field.
  + The LEGACY and PARANOID filter types that were allowed
    options in the '--filter-policy' option in the ModemManager
    daemon were deprecated in version 1.16.0 and have now been
    completely removed, along with the vid:pid blacklist of
    devices and the vid:pid greylist of RS232<->USB adapters.
  + The ModemManager daemon can run now in a 'quick suspend/resume'
    mode, in which no explicit data disconnection is triggered on
    suspend, and no explicit device re-probing from scratch is
    launched on resume. Instead, the daemon will try to refresh
    the state of all interfaces upon suspend, e.g. to see if the
    module keeps registered to the same operator, to see if it is
    still connected, and so on.
  + core: added support for the new 'WWAN' subsystem in Linux kernel
    5.13, enabling PCIe-only modules.
  + core: The charset conversion methods rework, including the
    avoiding of the iconv()
  + qmi: the logic managing allowed/preferred modes was fixed for
    multimode devices like the MC7304, making sure the acquisition
    order preference always had the same items.
  + serial: when modem is connected with AT+PPP, ignore forced
    disconnections, so that we don't take ownership of the PPP
    port before pppd has released it.
  + foxconn: added support for the T99W175 (SDX55) module,
    including built-in FCC unlock procedure.
  + foxconn: added new MBIM QDU firmware update method.
- Move the dbus-1 system.d file to /usr (bsc#1196170)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  6 15:41:18 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.14.8:
  + Build:
    - Fixed distcheck with new gtk-doc releases.
    - ModemManager-names.h was being included in the dist tarball,
      but then removed on the 'clean' target. Fix that, by only
      removing it on the 'maintainer-clean' target. Therefore,
      'xsltproc' is now only needed in git builds, not needed when
      building from a dist tarball.
  + QMI:
    - Fix daemon crash when the device is removed during the
      initialization sequence.
  + Several other minor improvements and fixes.
- Drop libxslt-tools BuildRequires: No longer needed.

  + Daemon:
    - Switched to 'STRICT' filter mode by default.
    - Added a new implicit whitelist rules applicable in 'STRICT' filter mode.
    - Updated the probing logic to make sure we don't attempt a re-probe when
    the device is gone.
    - Updated daemon logging.
  + AT:
    - Moved the charset definition logic to the initialization phase instead
      of the enabling phase.
    - Updated manual registration operation

      required NMEA traces before starting the engine.
    - Update carrier code if registration changes from one roaming operator
      to another.
    - Explicitly disable autoconnect during modem enabling phase, because it
      interferes with our connection management logic.
    - Fallback to raw-ip if WDA Get Data Format requests arguments, as in most
      new 5G devices.
    - Updated to always use the asynchronous close() operation.
    - Handle disconnection indications during connection attempts.
  + MBIM:
    - Update carrier code if registration changes from one roaming operator to
      another.
    - Implement reset in Intel-based and Qualcomm-based devices.
    - Avoid LTE attach config/status if unsupported.
    - Updated to make sure all allocated QMI CIDs are released during shutdown.

    - Updated to avoid connection checks or stats updates while disconnecting.
  + libmm-glib:
    - New 'mm_location_gps_nmea_get_traces()' method to retrieve a NULL
      terminated array of strings with all cached NMEA traces.
    - Deprecated the 'mm_location_gps_nmea_build_full()' method.
  + mmcli:
    - Added a new 'any' lookup keyword for the --modem and --sim options, useful
      when the system is only expected to have one single device.
  + Plugins:
    - broadmobi: new plugin, right now just with port type hints for the BM818.
    - foxconn: new plugin to support the T77W968 (both with and without eSIM).
    - dell,dw5821e: added support for the DW5821e with eSIM variant.

Wed Feb 12 17:49:35 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.12.6:
  + SIM: Updated logic to avoid sending PIN/PUK to the SIM card
    when not required (e.g. if already unlocked).
  + Simple interface: Avoid aborting connection if SIM-PUK2 locked,
    as PIN2/PUK2 doesn't prevent us from getting connected.
  + Location interface: Fixed memory leak happening as soon as a
    position fix was obtained and gps-raw location source was

Wed Nov  6 20:40:26 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.12.0
  + Modem interface:
    - Updated logic to avoid assuming that setting bands or modes
      is immediate, the daemon will now actively monitor for those
      updates to happen before returning success.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - libmm-glib: deprecated the mm_pco_list_free() helper method.
  + Simple interface:
    - api,libmm-glib: deprecated the 'subscription state' property.
  + Location interface:

    - Added support for MSB A-GPS in addition to MSA A-GPS.
  + Voice interface:
    - Improved voice call management with call id detection and
      tracking.
    - Improved detailed call state transitions on generic modems
      that support call list polling.
    - Added support for GSM supplementary services, including call
      waiting, call transfer, call deflection, multiparty calls...
    - Added emergency call support, allowing voice call to
      emergency numbers even without SIM or with SIM-PIN locked.
    - Deprecated all properties except for 'number' in the
      CreateCall() method.
  + Messaging interface:
    - Updated to report SMS timestamps in correct ISO8601 format.
  + Bearer:
    - Improved unused CID lookup to allow selecting non-sequential
      CIDs.
    - Disabled all AT protocol based context monitoring when PPP
      is used for the connection, in order to properly sync with
      pppd, which should be the one detecting the disconnections
  + QMI:
    - Improved support to list stored firmware images in Sierra
      devices.
    - Added additional lock check retries on 'SIM not inserted'
      errors.

    - Removed support for the ID_MM_PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROBE udev
      tag, as it is no longer required given that the more generic
      explicit whitelist may be used to flag which devices should
      be probed.
    - Renamed ID_MM_DEVICE_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY to
      ID_MM_TTY_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY, given that the tag only applies
      to TTYs.
    - ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE is no longer used internally in
      ModemManager, and is instead targeted to users that want to
      explicitly ignore specific devices regardless of what filter
      type is in use (already in 1.10.6).
  + dbus:
    - Updated to always report the registered
      MM_CORE_ERROR_CANCELLED error instead of the implicit

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  1 14:10:52 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.10.8:
  + Polkit policy:
    + Added several missing methods to the policy rules.
    + Use the explicit Firmware policy for all firmware operations.
    + Updated USSD policy to require user authentication in strict
      mode.
  + systemd service:
    - Always start after polkit service when policy control is
      enabled.
  + Broadband modem:
    - Fixed signal quality reporting when +CSQ is used.
  + 3GPP:
    - Fixed reporting 'denied' registration state.
  + QMI:
    - Fixed NAS SSP support check during supported capability loading.
  + Simple interface:
    - Allow one single ongoing Connect() attempt.
    - Fixed Disconnect() when an explicit bearer path is given.
  + mmcli:
    - Fixed key-value output when printing array with 10 elements.
  + Plugins:
    - simtech: added port type hints for the SIM7000/SIM7600 family.
    - x22x: added support for the Alcatel X602D.
    - telit: increased timeout for AT#REBOOT.
    - quectel: fixed port type hints for the EG91.
    - quectel: added port type hints for the BG96.
- Update to version 1.10.6:
  + Bearer: if connecting a bearer with PPP method, require upper layers
    to disconnect the bearer explicitly and completely ignore the
    connectivity checks performed by the modem itself. This makes sure
    that the TTY is not reused by ModemManager before pppd has finished
    using it.
  + Serial port:
    - Fix serial port flash cancellation logic to avoid assertion if the
      device gets unplugged during the flash operation.
    - Fix serial port reopen logic to flag the port as forced-closed if
      the reopening fails, to avoid assertion if the device gets
      unplugged during the reopen operation.
    - Avoid warning when signals are disconnected automatically during
      last object unref.
  + SMS:
    - Initialize common fields early for multipart messages, without
      waiting for the last part to arrive.
  + 3GPP:
    - Report consolidated registration state as DENIED if all the other
      ones are either idle or unknown.
  + udev:
    - Updated ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE to make it really a user-usable tag,
      applicable not only to TTY devices but to any kind of device
      (e.g. to blacklist MBIM modems); and also applicable under any
      kind of filter mode (including 'strict' mode).
  + Filter:
    - Added new 'explicit blacklist' filter rule, by default enabled for
      all filter modes and controlled with the
      MM_FILTER_RULE_EXPLICIT_BLACKLIST envvar.
    - Added new 'plugin whitelist' filter rule, enabled exclusively in
      'strict' filter mode, which allows us to automatically flag for
      probing those devices that are flagged with specific
      plugin-selected udev tags or which have vid:pid pairs registered
      as allowed in the plugins.
    - Updated the 'AT-capable ttyACM' filter rule, so that we only
      process and probe the serial port if the device also exposes other
      ports (serial, cdc-wdm, net) that ModemManager may process. This
      fix should allow us to automatically ignore Arduino devices that
      wrongly report themselves as speaking AT protocol in the ttyACM
      port.
  + QMI:
    - Fix segfault while updating bands and the device doesn't support
      the 'extended LTE band preference' TLV.
  + MBIM:
    - Fix segfault while processing empty USSD responses.
  + libmm-glib:
    - Properly handle NULL pointer on MMFirmwareUpdateSettings.
  + Plugins:
    - sierra: added port type hints for the MC74xx family.
    - telit: added port type hints for the ME910 and the EG91.
    - cinterion: added port type hints for the PLS8.
- Update to version 1.10.4:
  + QMI:
    - Fix assertion when cleaning up event report indications.
  + MBIM:
    - Fix detecting errors in "Register State Set" responses.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - Use correct finish() method to complete user registration.

    - u-blox: fix segfault when UACT? returns empty band list.
- Update to version 1.10.2:
  + Carrier configuration reporting and automatic selection.
  + Manager interface:
    - Fixed inhibition alloc/dealloc mixup.
  + Modem interface:
    - New 'CarrierConfiguration' property that shows which is the
      currently selected carrier configuration in the device, if
      known.
    - New automatic carrier configuration selection logic, based
      on per-device or per-vendor mapping.
  + Messaging interface:
    - Flush SMS list update before notifying added/removed signals.
  + SMS:
    - Fixed sending binary PDUs via AT commands when other AT command
      operations are scheduled at the same time.
  + QMI:
    - Increased the number of open retries from 10 to 20, required
      e.g. for the Telit LM940/960 modems.
    - Implemented QMI PDC based carrier config loading and automatic
      switching.
  + Plugins:
    - dell: added port type hints for the DW5820e.
    - dell: use QMI DMS extension method to load properly formatted
      firmware version strings.
    - quectel: added port type hints for the EG06.
    - ublox: added alternative port type hints for the LISA/SARA-U2.

    - Updated --monitor-state to report modem removal.
  + Several memory leak fixes in different modules.
- Run testsuite

- Do build without requiring bash-completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 26 10:04:30 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com
  
- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + udev:
    - Consolidated common tag names among all the supported
      plugins. E.g. ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_GPS, ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AT_*,
      ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_QCDM... All these generic tags are included
      as symbols in the API, and compatibility will be maintained
      for these. Custom setups of ModemManager relying on
      previously available per-plugin udev tags may need to
      manually port them to this new generic subset.
    - New tag to allow specifying flow control settings to use in
      serial ports.
  + Core:
    - Avoid probing other protocols on TTYs tagged in udev with
      specific port type tags (e.g. avoid probing QCDM if a port is
      tagged as AT). This allows faster port probing and modem
      detection for known modem layouts.
    - Implemented support to enable and handle +CGEV URCs for
      asynchronous connection state updates in AT-controlled
      devices.
  + Manager interface:
    - New runtime daemon version reporting.
    - New support for requesting device inhibition, e.g. so that
      ModemManager stops completely using a modem device until the
      inhibition is released. This feature is implemented to allow
      fwupd taking over of a device completely for as long as it
      needs during a firmware update.
  + Modem interface:
    - All methods are always connected, even in Failed state.
    - Allow parallel Enable()/Disable() calls.
    - Deprecated redundant ListBearers() method, the read-only
      Bearers property is already showing the same information.
  + Bearer interface:
    - New 'BearerType' property, e.g. to specify whether a bearer
      is the initial LTE default bearer or not.
    - Deprecated 'number' field in bearer settings. Applications do
      not need to send the 'number' field in Bearer.Connect() or in
      Modem.Simple.Connect(), as the setting is totally ignored.
  + mmcli:
    - New 'key-value' output, easier to parse by scripts than the
      default.
    - Removed redundant '--location-get-XXX' actions, as the
      '--location-get' already reports the location information for
      all sources.
    - Removed redundant '--simple-status' action, as the same
      information can be obtained through different mmcli
      operations.
    - New manager '--inhibit-device' action and modem-specific
      '--inhibit', to allow requesting device inhibition.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - New support for exposing the network reported Protocol
      Configuration Options (PCO), to be used instead of the new
      deprecated Subscription State property.
    - New support for exposing the initial LTE default bearer
      status.
    - New support for configuring the initial LTE default bearer
      settings.
  + Location interface:
    - New LTE Tracking Area Code (TAC) in 3GPP location
      information.
    - New support for injecting assistance data (e.g. Qualcomm
      XTRA) into the GNSS engine, useful when there is no mobile
      connection to use MSA A-GPS.
  + Firmware interface:
    - Support for reporting firmware update support properties,
      e.g. specifying which update methods are supported. This
      information will be consumed by fwupd in order to allow
      upgrading firmware in devices managed by ModemManager.
  + Voice interface:
    - Multiple improvements and fixes in the voice call management
      logic implemented with generic AT commands.
    - Added AudioPort and AudioFormat properties to the Call
      object.
    - Added new generic audio channel setup/cleanup handlers in the
      Call object.
  + QMI:
    - New LOC service based GNSS support, including A-GPS setup via
      SUPL server.
    - New support for the "extended" LTE band list.
    - New support for reading IMSI and ICCID with the UIM service.
  + MBIM:
    - Implemented support for processing Protocol Configuration
      Options using Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
    - Implemented support for LTE attach status and configuration
      using Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
    - Implemented support for the extended signal interface and for
      3GPP location details using the AT&T specific service.
    - Implemented support for 3GPP USSD operations using the
      standard USSD service.
    - For Qualcomm-based MBIM devices, those with QMI-over-MBIM
      support, a whole new set of features is now available,
      including: QMI LOC/PDS location support, allowed/preferred
      mode management, frequency band selection, power management
      operations...
  + Plugins:
    - xmm: new XMM plugin, with shared logic (allowed/preferred
      mode management, frequency band selection, power management
      operations, extended signal quality reporting, GPS/A-GPS...)
      for Intel XMM based devices.
    - fibocom: new plugin, with support for generic MBIM and
      XMM-based devices.
    - dell: added support for XMM-based devices, like the DW5820e.
    - dell: added custom support for the DW5821e, including
      'unmanaged' GPS and firmware update integration details.
    - cinterion: new shared interface to include all logic shared
      between Option and Option/HSO devices.
    - sierra-legacy: implemented connection monitoring support.
    - u-blox: added support for extended call state transitions.
    - u-blox: added CDC-ECM support for SARA/LISA-U2xx modems.
    - altair-lte: migrated from SubscriptionState to PCO.
- Changes from version 1.8.0:
  + New 'filter policy' setting in the ModemManager daemon to
    decide which ports are probed and how. Currently these levels
    are defined:
    - WHITELIST-ONLY: Only devices or ports explicitly whitelisted
      with the new 'ID_MM_DEVICE_PROCESS' udev tag are probed.
    - DEFAULT: All ports are allowed to be probed except for the
      ones explicitly greylisted as RS232 adapters or completely
      blacklisted. This is the default approach that was used until
      now, and the default as well in this release if a different
      one isn't requested.
    - STRICT: The daemon defines a set of heuristics to try to
      detect modems and ports to probe. Only the TTY ports that are
      very very likely to be modem ports are probed, therefore
      completely avoiding the need of having a separate blacklist
      or RS232 adapter greylist. But note that this policy may end
      up ignoring some devices, like TTY controlled modems without
      an associated network port.
    - PARANOID: This is equivalent to running the STRICT mode but
      also applying the blacklist and RS232 greylist filters
      explicitly.
  + Device 'naming'. This release includes logic to allow 'naming'
    devices with the ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID udev tag, so that the names
    can then be used in e.g. mmcli and also exposed in the 'Device'
    property in the Modem interface. This new setup makes it
    possible to give the devices unique names that are kept across
    reboots.
  + Allow skipping the automatic scan for devices in the daemon
    with the new '--no-auto-scan' daemon option. Instead, the
    daemon may be called with the '--initial-kernel-events=[PATH]'
    option including a predefined list of ports or otherwise get
    the port additions reported during runtime with the mmcli
    --report-kernel-event=[] command.
  + Allow building and running without 'udev'. In this setup, the
    previously explained '--no-auto-scan' is enabled by default, so
    ports are not automatically detected .Note that this setup is
    not suggested for standard distributions: if udev is available
    in the system, it is the preferred method to manage the port
    addition and removal.
  + SIM hot swap. The core includes the needed logic to support SIM
    hot swap in the different devices, although for now it's only
    tested for Telit and MBIM modems. If a SIM hot swap is
    detected, the modem is flagged as failed and reprobed from
    scratch.
  + Connection status monitoring logic. In order to try to detect
    network initiated disconnections, a generic setup is provided
    to plugins so that they can implement explicit connection
    status checks that would be executed periodically.
  + New support for 3GPP CSFB states and operation modes. We now
    support registration states reported as "SMS only" or "CSFB not
    preferred", and provide APIs to set and get the "UE mode of
    operation for EPS".
  + Build and system:
    - Updated the systemd service file with additional security
      related rules.
    - Added support for systemd journal logging.
    - Updated most of the code to use GTask instead of the
      deprecated GSimpleAsyncResult based operations.
    - ChangeLog is built from git during the dist tarball
      generation.
  + API:
    - Defined additional GSM, UMTS and LTE frequency bands.
    - The MMModemBand enumeration values (EUTRAN, UTRAN and CDMA)
      have been renamed to consolidate how they are defined. A
      compatibility layer has been provided to avoid breaking the
      API.
    - New 'HardwareRevision' property in the Modem interface.
    - New 'EpsUeModeOperation' property and 'SetEpsUeModeOperation'
      method in the Modem 3GPP interface.
  + Core:
    - Updated libqcdm to load signal strength from QCDM EVDO Pilot
      Sets.
    - Updated udev rules with new per-vendor rules for quicker
      processing.
    - Explicitly ignored ports are never probed now, but they will
      be reported as owned by the device and exposed in the Ports
      property.
    - New 'ID_MM_TTY_BAUDRATE' udev tag to specify the baudrate to
      use in RS232 TTY ports.
    - If using UCS2, still assume that the operator name may be
      given in ASCII.
    - Explicitly open QCDM ports anytime it's needed, instead of
      assuming they are open when enabled.
    - Query supported ME event reporting options and automatically
      set the best choice based on the supported ones.
    - Query supported flow control modems and automatically set the
      best choice based on the supported ones.
    - Explicitly configure flow control settings on the TTY as soon
      as it is connected, only applicable for RS232 devices.
    - Implemented generic unlock retries loading.
  + MBIM:
    - Explicitly reprobe the modem when the mbim-proxy is detected
      dead.
    - Workaround implemented to keep track of the PIN1 unlock
      retries as the protocol isn't very good allowing this.
    - Load and expose HW revision.
  + QMI:
    - Explicitly reprobe the modem when the qmi-proxy is detected
      dead.
    - Load and expose HW revision.
    - Detect port closed and forbid client allocation operations.
    - New optional connection status monitoring support, enabled by
      default for the Netgear AC341U.
  + Location interface: Disabled by default for MBIM modems.
  + Messaging interface: Try decoding with UTF-16BE when UCS-2
    reported.
  + Plugins:
    - u-blox: new plugin, currently supporting the TOBY-L2,
      TOBY-L4, TOBY-R2, LARA-R2 and LISA-R2.
    - quectel: new plugin, supporting generic AT/QMI based modems.
    - cinterion: implemented support for devices exposing a WWAN
      network interface.
    - cinterion: support changing modes in LTE capable devices.
    - cinterion: added GPS support for devices controlled only with
      AT^SGPSC.
    - cinterion: use ^SIND unsolicited messages for access tech
      reporting.
    - huawei: implemented Signal interface.
    - telit: added support for RS232, QMI and MBIM modems.
    - novatel: cleaned up registration state and access tech
      reporting.
    - novatel-lte: implemented unlock retries loading.
    - dell: speed probing time up and reduce udev dependency.
    - mbm: added GPS support for the Dell DW5560.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop intltool BuildRequires, no longer needed.
- Pass --with-systemd-journal to configure, ensure we use the new
  journald support for logging.

Mon Aug 15 09:29:09 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to version 1.6.0 (boo#975211):
  + New features:
    - Core:
      . Implemented support for suspend/resume detection, currently
        working when systemd is in use. Whenever the system is
        suspended, we'll flag the modems as invalid so that they
        are re-probed from scratch when the system is resumed.
      . Added cancellation support for the probing operations.
      . Reworked and simplified the serial port response
        processing.
    - Location interface:
      . Added A-GPS support, currently available only for QMI based
        modems with PDS service.
      . Added support for updating the default GPS refresh time.
    - Time interface: New default implementation for all AT-based
      modems.
    - Voice interface: New DBus interface to allow the management
      of voice calls, which currently assumes that the audio
      channel is setup out of ModemManager.
    - Bearer: New support for reporting statistics of the ongoing
      connection with a new 'Stats' property, currently available
      for QMI and MBIM based modems.
    - QMI:
      . Implemented support for devices which only work in "raw IP"
        mode, like the Sierra MC7455.
      . Implemented support for SIM related operations using the
        UIM service, as newer modems with multi-SIM capabilities
        don't support the legacy DMS UIM operations.
      . Implemented support for detecting network-initiated
        disconnections.
    - MBIM: If online mode fails, try to use the 'DMS Set FCC
      Authentication' QMI
    - udev: Added new supported 'ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE' tag to allow
      fully ignoring ports specified by the user.
    - mmcli:
      . Added command completion.
      . Added new operations to use the Voice interface.
    - Build: Added code coverage support.
    - Plugins:
      . haier: new plugin to support the Haier CE81B.
      . thuraya: new plugin for Thuraya satellite modems.
      . sierra-legacy,sierra: the implementation for Sierra modems
        is now split into two different plugins: a 'legacy' one for
        the old PPP and DirectIP based modems and the standard one
        for the newer QMI and MBIM based ones.
      . dell: new plugin for Dell rebranded devices from Novatel, 
        Sierra or Ericsson.
      . gobi: removed the plugin. All non-vendor specific QMI
        devices should now be managed by the generic plugin.
      . mbm: dynamically load the list of supported modes.
      . mbm: fixed several connection/disconnection issues.
      . simtech: support QMI devices.
      . huawei: implemented Voice call management support.
      . huawei: use static IP addressing in NDISDUP capable devices 
        if the AT^DHCP response provides the IP details.
  + Existing features backported to 1.4.x releases also present in 
    in ModemManager 1.6.0:
    - MBIM:
      . The mbim-proxy is used by default.
      . Implemented support for disconnection status notification 
        while connected.
      . Disabled CDMA capabilities, until properly supported.
    - QMI:
      . The qmi-proxy is used by default.
      . If online mode fails, use 'DMS Set FCC Authentication', 
        required by some rebranded Sierra modems (e.g. Dell branded 
        ones).
      . Implemented support for loading SIM operator id and name.
      . Implemented power-cycle reset functionality.
    - Plugins:
      . telit:
        . added support for new devices, like HE910, UE910 and 
        . implemented dynamic port identification.
        . implemented unlock retries loading.
        . implemented supported/current bands management.
        . implemented supported/current modes management.
        . implemented modem reset and power down.
      . mbm: implemented GPS support for Ericsson HS2350 and 
        H5321gw modems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 20 11:57:19 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + This version comes with the following updates in the
    interfaces:
    - Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in
      the Bearer:
      . Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that
        SLAAC should be used to retrieve correct addressing and
        routing details.
      . DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static
        IP address, as IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local
        address to be present.
      . MTU is now also included in the IP configuration
        properties, if specified by the modem, and applicable to
        both DHCP and STATIC methods.
    - New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem
      device. After setting the modem in this state, no further use
      of it can be done. Currently available in Wavecom and
      Cinterion.
    - Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows
      to start/stop the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the
      location information retrieval to other processes. Currently
      available in modems with independent GPS TTYs, like
      Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
    - New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for
      internal system tests.
  + Other notable changes include:
    - MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
    - Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
    - Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
    - Huawei: implemented GPS support.
    - Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new
      huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
    - Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
    - Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
    - Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
    - Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN
      unlock.
    - Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
    - Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't
      need full reset.
    - Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing
      test-driven virtual ports and system tests run during
      'make check'. This new feature also comes with a new internal
      'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*] options in
      the ModemManager program.
    - and many more fixes...
- Changes from version 1.2.0:
  + Signal interface: new interface for extended signal quality
    information.
  + OMA interface: new interface to expose the Device Management
    capabilities defined by the Open Mobile Alliance.
  + Messaging interface: new 'Messages' property.
  + Modem interface: new 'Bearers' property.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 20 08:29:18 UTC 2014 - lnussel@suse.de

- Add ModemManager-1.0.0-systemd-activation.patch: Fix systemd dbus
  activation (bnc#892682). Systemd does not honor Alias= lines in
  install sections; that only works if the service file in question
  is actually enabled. So the dbus service file must refer to
  ModemManager.service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 23 03:34:04 UTC 2014 - rlmu@suse.com

- Added bnc878066-serial-ports-on-the-IO-card-are-not-responding.patch

Wed Jan 22 11:59:13 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- As we enabled pkgconfig(qmi-glib) and pkgconfig(mbim-glib)
  BuildRequires (last change), it's arguably also a good idea to
  replace --without-qmi and --without-mbim configure parameters
  with their --with-qmi and --with-mbim counterparts (and thus
  actually really enable the support).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  1 17:04:45 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Enable pkgconfig(qmi-glib) and pkgconfig(mbim-glib)
