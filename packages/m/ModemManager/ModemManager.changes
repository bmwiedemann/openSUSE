-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  6 20:40:26 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.12.0
  + Modem interface:
    - Updated logic to avoid assuming that setting bands or modes
      is immediate, the daemon will now actively monitor for those
      updates to happen before returning success.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - libmm-glib: deprecated the mm_pco_list_free() helper method.
  + Simple interface:
    - api,libmm-glib: deprecated the 'subscription state' property.
  + Location interface:
    - Fixed 'unknown' lat/long/alt numeric values.
    - Added support for MSB A-GPS in addition to MSA A-GPS.
  + Voice interface:
    - Improved voice call management with call id detection and
      tracking.
    - Improved detailed call state transitions on generic modems
      that support call list polling.
    - Added support for GSM supplementary services, including call
      waiting, call transfer, call deflection, multiparty calls...
    - Added emergency call support, allowing voice call to
      emergency numbers even without SIM or with SIM-PIN locked.
    - Deprecated all properties except for 'number' in the
      CreateCall() method.
  + Messaging interface:
    - Updated to report SMS timestamps in correct ISO8601 format.
  + Bearer:
    - Improved unused CID lookup to allow selecting non-sequential
      CIDs.
    - Disabled all AT protocol based context monitoring when PPP
      is used for the connection, in order to properly sync with
      pppd, which should be the one detecting the disconnections
  + QMI:
    - Improved support to list stored firmware images in Sierra
      devices.
    - Added additional lock check retries on 'SIM not inserted'
      errors.
    - Updated explicit registration attempt to report success only
      when the target requested network is registered.
    - Added MSB A-GPS support.
    - Implemented automatic carrier configuration selection using
      PDC service (already in 1.10.2).
  + mmcli:

    - Updated to allow using the modem UID to specify SIM
      operations.
  + udev:
    - New ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AUDIO generic udev tag to identify ports
      that should be used for in-band audio.
    - Removed support for the ID_MM_PLATFORM_DRIVER_PROBE udev
      tag, as it is no longer required given that the more generic
      explicit whitelist may be used to flag which devices should
      be probed.
    - Renamed ID_MM_DEVICE_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY to
      ID_MM_TTY_MANUAL_SCAN_ONLY, given that the tag only applies
      to TTYs.
    - ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE is no longer used internally in
      ModemManager, and is instead targeted to users that want to
      explicitly ignore specific devices regardless of what filter
      type is in use (already in 1.10.6).
  + dbus:
    - Updated to always report the registered
      MM_CORE_ERROR_CANCELLED error instead of the implicit
      G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED ones generated by GLib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  1 14:10:52 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.10.8:
  + Polkit policy:
    + Added several missing methods to the policy rules.
    + Use the explicit Firmware policy for all firmware operations.
    + Updated USSD policy to require user authentication in strict
      mode.
  + systemd service:
    - Always start after polkit service when policy control is
      enabled.
  + Broadband modem:
    - Fixed signal quality reporting when +CSQ is used.
  + 3GPP:
    - Fixed reporting 'denied' registration state.
  + QMI:
    - Fixed NAS SSP support check during supported capability loading.
  + Simple interface:
    - Allow one single ongoing Connect() attempt.
    - Fixed Disconnect() when an explicit bearer path is given.
  + mmcli:
    - Fixed key-value output when printing array with 10 elements.
  + Plugins:
    - simtech: added port type hints for the SIM7000/SIM7600 family.
    - x22x: added support for the Alcatel X602D.
    - telit: increased timeout for AT#REBOOT.
    - quectel: fixed port type hints for the EG91.
    - quectel: added port type hints for the BG96.
- Update to version 1.10.6:
  + Bearer: if connecting a bearer with PPP method, require upper layers
    to disconnect the bearer explicitly and completely ignore the
    connectivity checks performed by the modem itself. This makes sure
    that the TTY is not reused by ModemManager before pppd has finished
    using it.
  + Serial port:
    - Fix serial port flash cancellation logic to avoid assertion if the
      device gets unplugged during the flash operation.
    - Fix serial port reopen logic to flag the port as forced-closed if
      the reopening fails, to avoid assertion if the device gets
      unplugged during the reopen operation.
    - Avoid warning when signals are disconnected automatically during
      last object unref.
  + SMS:
    - Initialize common fields early for multipart messages, without
      waiting for the last part to arrive.
  + 3GPP:
    - Report consolidated registration state as DENIED if all the other
      ones are either idle or unknown.
  + udev:
    - Updated ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE to make it really a user-usable tag,
      applicable not only to TTY devices but to any kind of device
      (e.g. to blacklist MBIM modems); and also applicable under any
      kind of filter mode (including 'strict' mode).
  + Filter:
    - Added new 'explicit blacklist' filter rule, by default enabled for
      all filter modes and controlled with the
      MM_FILTER_RULE_EXPLICIT_BLACKLIST envvar.
    - Added new 'plugin whitelist' filter rule, enabled exclusively in
      'strict' filter mode, which allows us to automatically flag for
      probing those devices that are flagged with specific
      plugin-selected udev tags or which have vid:pid pairs registered
      as allowed in the plugins.
    - Updated the 'AT-capable ttyACM' filter rule, so that we only
      process and probe the serial port if the device also exposes other
      ports (serial, cdc-wdm, net) that ModemManager may process. This
      fix should allow us to automatically ignore Arduino devices that
      wrongly report themselves as speaking AT protocol in the ttyACM
      port.
  + QMI:
    - Fix segfault while updating bands and the device doesn't support
      the 'extended LTE band preference' TLV.
  + MBIM:
    - Fix segfault while processing empty USSD responses.
  + libmm-glib:
    - Properly handle NULL pointer on MMFirmwareUpdateSettings.
  + Plugins:
    - sierra: added port type hints for the MC74xx family.
    - telit: added port type hints for the ME910 and the EG91.
    - cinterion: added port type hints for the PLS8.
- Update to version 1.10.4:
  + QMI:
    - Fix assertion when cleaning up event report indications.
  + MBIM:
    - Fix detecting errors in "Register State Set" responses.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - Use correct finish() method to complete user registration.
  + Plugins:
    - u-blox: fix segfault when UACT? returns empty band list.
- Update to version 1.10.2:
  + Carrier configuration reporting and automatic selection.
  + Manager interface:
    - Fixed inhibition alloc/dealloc mixup.
  + Modem interface:
    - New 'CarrierConfiguration' property that shows which is the
      currently selected carrier configuration in the device, if
      known.
    - New automatic carrier configuration selection logic, based
      on per-device or per-vendor mapping.
  + Messaging interface:
    - Flush SMS list update before notifying added/removed signals.
  + SMS:
    - Fixed sending binary PDUs via AT commands when other AT command
      operations are scheduled at the same time.
  + QMI:
    - Increased the number of open retries from 10 to 20, required
      e.g. for the Telit LM940/960 modems.
    - Implemented QMI PDC based carrier config loading and automatic
      switching.
  + Plugins:
    - dell: added port type hints for the DW5820e.
    - dell: use QMI DMS extension method to load properly formatted
      firmware version strings.
    - quectel: added port type hints for the EG06.
    - ublox: added alternative port type hints for the LISA/SARA-U2.
    - telit: added support for MBIM-based telit modems.
  + mmcli:
    - Updated --monitor-state to report modem removal.
  + Several memory leak fixes in different modules.
- Run testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 09:38:26 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Reduce %systemd_requires to %systemd_ordering:
  %service_* can handle its absence.
- Rewrite summaries not to rely on em dash grammar.
- Do build without requiring bash-completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 26 10:04:30 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com
  
- Update to version 1.10.0:
  + udev:
    - Consolidated common tag names among all the supported
      plugins. E.g. ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_GPS, ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AT_*,
      ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_QCDM... All these generic tags are included
      as symbols in the API, and compatibility will be maintained
      for these. Custom setups of ModemManager relying on
      previously available per-plugin udev tags may need to
      manually port them to this new generic subset.
    - New tag to allow specifying flow control settings to use in
      serial ports.
  + Core:
    - Avoid probing other protocols on TTYs tagged in udev with
      specific port type tags (e.g. avoid probing QCDM if a port is
      tagged as AT). This allows faster port probing and modem
      detection for known modem layouts.
    - Implemented support to enable and handle +CGEV URCs for
      asynchronous connection state updates in AT-controlled
      devices.
  + Manager interface:
    - New runtime daemon version reporting.
    - New support for requesting device inhibition, e.g. so that
      ModemManager stops completely using a modem device until the
      inhibition is released. This feature is implemented to allow
      fwupd taking over of a device completely for as long as it
      needs during a firmware update.
  + Modem interface:
    - All methods are always connected, even in Failed state.
    - Allow parallel Enable()/Disable() calls.
    - Deprecated redundant ListBearers() method, the read-only
      Bearers property is already showing the same information.
  + Bearer interface:
    - New 'BearerType' property, e.g. to specify whether a bearer
      is the initial LTE default bearer or not.
    - Deprecated 'number' field in bearer settings. Applications do
      not need to send the 'number' field in Bearer.Connect() or in
      Modem.Simple.Connect(), as the setting is totally ignored.
  + mmcli:
    - New 'key-value' output, easier to parse by scripts than the
      default.
    - Removed redundant '--location-get-XXX' actions, as the
      '--location-get' already reports the location information for
      all sources.
    - Removed redundant '--simple-status' action, as the same
      information can be obtained through different mmcli
      operations.
    - New manager '--inhibit-device' action and modem-specific
      '--inhibit', to allow requesting device inhibition.
  + 3GPP interface:
    - New support for exposing the network reported Protocol
      Configuration Options (PCO), to be used instead of the new
      deprecated Subscription State property.
    - New support for exposing the initial LTE default bearer
      status.
    - New support for configuring the initial LTE default bearer
      settings.
  + Location interface:
    - New LTE Tracking Area Code (TAC) in 3GPP location
      information.
    - New support for injecting assistance data (e.g. Qualcomm
      XTRA) into the GNSS engine, useful when there is no mobile
      connection to use MSA A-GPS.
  + Firmware interface:
    - Support for reporting firmware update support properties,
      e.g. specifying which update methods are supported. This
      information will be consumed by fwupd in order to allow
      upgrading firmware in devices managed by ModemManager.
  + Voice interface:
    - Multiple improvements and fixes in the voice call management
      logic implemented with generic AT commands.
    - Added AudioPort and AudioFormat properties to the Call
      object.
    - Added new generic audio channel setup/cleanup handlers in the
      Call object.
  + QMI:
    - New LOC service based GNSS support, including A-GPS setup via
      SUPL server.
    - New support for the "extended" LTE band list.
    - New support for reading IMSI and ICCID with the UIM service.
  + MBIM:
    - Implemented support for processing Protocol Configuration
      Options using Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
    - Implemented support for LTE attach status and configuration
      using Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions.
    - Implemented support for the extended signal interface and for
      3GPP location details using the AT&T specific service.
    - Implemented support for 3GPP USSD operations using the
      standard USSD service.
    - For Qualcomm-based MBIM devices, those with QMI-over-MBIM
      support, a whole new set of features is now available,
      including: QMI LOC/PDS location support, allowed/preferred
      mode management, frequency band selection, power management
      operations...
  + Plugins:
    - xmm: new XMM plugin, with shared logic (allowed/preferred
      mode management, frequency band selection, power management
      operations, extended signal quality reporting, GPS/A-GPS...)
      for Intel XMM based devices.
    - fibocom: new plugin, with support for generic MBIM and
      XMM-based devices.
    - dell: added support for XMM-based devices, like the DW5820e.
    - dell: added custom support for the DW5821e, including
      'unmanaged' GPS and firmware update integration details.
    - cinterion: new shared interface to include all logic shared
      between Option and Option/HSO devices.
    - sierra-legacy: implemented connection monitoring support.
    - u-blox: added support for extended call state transitions.
    - u-blox: added CDC-ECM support for SARA/LISA-U2xx modems.
    - altair-lte: migrated from SubscriptionState to PCO.
- Changes from version 1.8.0:
  + New 'filter policy' setting in the ModemManager daemon to
    decide which ports are probed and how. Currently these levels
    are defined:
    - WHITELIST-ONLY: Only devices or ports explicitly whitelisted
      with the new 'ID_MM_DEVICE_PROCESS' udev tag are probed.
    - DEFAULT: All ports are allowed to be probed except for the
      ones explicitly greylisted as RS232 adapters or completely
      blacklisted. This is the default approach that was used until
      now, and the default as well in this release if a different
      one isn't requested.
    - STRICT: The daemon defines a set of heuristics to try to
      detect modems and ports to probe. Only the TTY ports that are
      very very likely to be modem ports are probed, therefore
      completely avoiding the need of having a separate blacklist
      or RS232 adapter greylist. But note that this policy may end
      up ignoring some devices, like TTY controlled modems without
      an associated network port.
    - PARANOID: This is equivalent to running the STRICT mode but
      also applying the blacklist and RS232 greylist filters
      explicitly.
  + Device 'naming'. This release includes logic to allow 'naming'
    devices with the ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID udev tag, so that the names
    can then be used in e.g. mmcli and also exposed in the 'Device'
    property in the Modem interface. This new setup makes it
    possible to give the devices unique names that are kept across
    reboots.
  + Allow skipping the automatic scan for devices in the daemon
    with the new '--no-auto-scan' daemon option. Instead, the
    daemon may be called with the '--initial-kernel-events=[PATH]'
    option including a predefined list of ports or otherwise get
    the port additions reported during runtime with the mmcli
    --report-kernel-event=[] command.
  + Allow building and running without 'udev'. In this setup, the
    previously explained '--no-auto-scan' is enabled by default, so
    ports are not automatically detected .Note that this setup is
    not suggested for standard distributions: if udev is available
    in the system, it is the preferred method to manage the port
    addition and removal.
  + SIM hot swap. The core includes the needed logic to support SIM
    hot swap in the different devices, although for now it's only
    tested for Telit and MBIM modems. If a SIM hot swap is
    detected, the modem is flagged as failed and reprobed from
    scratch.
  + Connection status monitoring logic. In order to try to detect
    network initiated disconnections, a generic setup is provided
    to plugins so that they can implement explicit connection
    status checks that would be executed periodically.
  + New support for 3GPP CSFB states and operation modes. We now
    support registration states reported as "SMS only" or "CSFB not
    preferred", and provide APIs to set and get the "UE mode of
    operation for EPS".
  + Build and system:
    - Updated the systemd service file with additional security
      related rules.
    - Added support for systemd journal logging.
    - Updated most of the code to use GTask instead of the
      deprecated GSimpleAsyncResult based operations.
    - ChangeLog is built from git during the dist tarball
      generation.
  + API:
    - Defined additional GSM, UMTS and LTE frequency bands.
    - The MMModemBand enumeration values (EUTRAN, UTRAN and CDMA)
      have been renamed to consolidate how they are defined. A
      compatibility layer has been provided to avoid breaking the
      API.
    - New 'HardwareRevision' property in the Modem interface.
    - New 'EpsUeModeOperation' property and 'SetEpsUeModeOperation'
      method in the Modem 3GPP interface.
  + Core:
    - Updated libqcdm to load signal strength from QCDM EVDO Pilot
      Sets.
    - Updated udev rules with new per-vendor rules for quicker
      processing.
    - Explicitly ignored ports are never probed now, but they will
      be reported as owned by the device and exposed in the Ports
      property.
    - New 'ID_MM_TTY_BAUDRATE' udev tag to specify the baudrate to
      use in RS232 TTY ports.
    - If using UCS2, still assume that the operator name may be
      given in ASCII.
    - Explicitly open QCDM ports anytime it's needed, instead of
      assuming they are open when enabled.
    - Query supported ME event reporting options and automatically
      set the best choice based on the supported ones.
    - Query supported flow control modems and automatically set the
      best choice based on the supported ones.
    - Explicitly configure flow control settings on the TTY as soon
      as it is connected, only applicable for RS232 devices.
    - Implemented generic unlock retries loading.
  + MBIM:
    - Explicitly reprobe the modem when the mbim-proxy is detected
      dead.
    - Workaround implemented to keep track of the PIN1 unlock
      retries as the protocol isn't very good allowing this.
    - Load and expose HW revision.
  + QMI:
    - Explicitly reprobe the modem when the qmi-proxy is detected
      dead.
    - Load and expose HW revision.
    - Detect port closed and forbid client allocation operations.
    - New optional connection status monitoring support, enabled by
      default for the Netgear AC341U.
  + Location interface: Disabled by default for MBIM modems.
  + Messaging interface: Try decoding with UTF-16BE when UCS-2
    reported.
  + Plugins:
    - u-blox: new plugin, currently supporting the TOBY-L2,
      TOBY-L4, TOBY-R2, LARA-R2 and LISA-R2.
    - quectel: new plugin, supporting generic AT/QMI based modems.
    - cinterion: implemented support for devices exposing a WWAN
      network interface.
    - cinterion: support changing modes in LTE capable devices.
    - cinterion: added GPS support for devices controlled only with
      AT^SGPSC.
    - cinterion: use ^SIND unsolicited messages for access tech
      reporting.
    - huawei: implemented Signal interface.
    - telit: added support for RS232, QMI and MBIM modems.
    - novatel: cleaned up registration state and access tech
      reporting.
    - novatel-lte: implemented unlock retries loading.
    - dell: speed probing time up and reduce udev dependency.
    - mbm: added GPS support for the Dell DW5560.
  + Updated translations.
- Drop intltool BuildRequires, no longer needed.
- Pass --with-systemd-journal to configure, ensure we use the new
  journald support for logging.

Mon Aug 15 09:29:09 UTC 2016 - bruno@ioda-net.ch

- Update to version 1.6.0 (boo#975211):
  + New features:
    - Core:
      . Implemented support for suspend/resume detection, currently
        working when systemd is in use. Whenever the system is
        suspended, we'll flag the modems as invalid so that they
        are re-probed from scratch when the system is resumed.
      . Added cancellation support for the probing operations.
      . Reworked and simplified the serial port response
        processing.
    - Location interface:
      . Added A-GPS support, currently available only for QMI based
        modems with PDS service.
      . Added support for updating the default GPS refresh time.
    - Time interface: New default implementation for all AT-based
      modems.
    - Voice interface: New DBus interface to allow the management
      of voice calls, which currently assumes that the audio
      channel is setup out of ModemManager.
    - Bearer: New support for reporting statistics of the ongoing
      connection with a new 'Stats' property, currently available
      for QMI and MBIM based modems.
    - QMI:
      . Implemented support for devices which only work in "raw IP"
        mode, like the Sierra MC7455.
      . Implemented support for SIM related operations using the
        UIM service, as newer modems with multi-SIM capabilities
        don't support the legacy DMS UIM operations.
      . Implemented support for detecting network-initiated
        disconnections.
    - MBIM: If online mode fails, try to use the 'DMS Set FCC
      Authentication' QMI
    - udev: Added new supported 'ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE' tag to allow
      fully ignoring ports specified by the user.
    - mmcli:
      . Added command completion.
      . Added new operations to use the Voice interface.
    - Build: Added code coverage support.
    - Plugins:
      . haier: new plugin to support the Haier CE81B.
      . thuraya: new plugin for Thuraya satellite modems.
      . sierra-legacy,sierra: the implementation for Sierra modems
        is now split into two different plugins: a 'legacy' one for
        the old PPP and DirectIP based modems and the standard one
        for the newer QMI and MBIM based ones.
      . dell: new plugin for Dell rebranded devices from Novatel, 
        Sierra or Ericsson.
      . gobi: removed the plugin. All non-vendor specific QMI
        devices should now be managed by the generic plugin.
      . mbm: dynamically load the list of supported modes.
      . mbm: fixed several connection/disconnection issues.
      . simtech: support QMI devices.
      . huawei: implemented Voice call management support.
      . huawei: use static IP addressing in NDISDUP capable devices 
        if the AT^DHCP response provides the IP details.
  + Existing features backported to 1.4.x releases also present in 
    in ModemManager 1.6.0:
    - MBIM:
      . The mbim-proxy is used by default.
      . Implemented support for disconnection status notification 
        while connected.
      . Disabled CDMA capabilities, until properly supported.
    - QMI:
      . The qmi-proxy is used by default.
      . If online mode fails, use 'DMS Set FCC Authentication', 
        required by some rebranded Sierra modems (e.g. Dell branded 
        ones).
      . Implemented support for loading SIM operator id and name.
      . Implemented power-cycle reset functionality.
    - Plugins:
      . telit:
        . added support for new devices, like HE910, UE910 and 
        . implemented dynamic port identification.
        . implemented unlock retries loading.
        . implemented supported/current bands management.
        . implemented supported/current modes management.
        . implemented modem reset and power down.
      . mbm: implemented GPS support for Ericsson HS2350 and 
        H5321gw modems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 20 11:57:19 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + This version comes with the following updates in the
    interfaces:
    - Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in
      the Bearer:
      . Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that
        SLAAC should be used to retrieve correct addressing and
        routing details.
      . DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static
        IP address, as IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local
        address to be present.
      . MTU is now also included in the IP configuration
        properties, if specified by the modem, and applicable to
        both DHCP and STATIC methods.
    - New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem
      device. After setting the modem in this state, no further use
      of it can be done. Currently available in Wavecom and
      Cinterion.
    - Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows
      to start/stop the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the
      location information retrieval to other processes. Currently
      available in modems with independent GPS TTYs, like
      Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
    - New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for
      internal system tests.
  + Other notable changes include:
    - MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
    - Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
    - Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
    - Huawei: implemented GPS support.
    - Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new
      huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
    - Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
    - Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
    - Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
    - Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN
      unlock.
    - Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
    - Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't
      need full reset.
    - Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing
      test-driven virtual ports and system tests run during
      'make check'. This new feature also comes with a new internal
      'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*] options in
      the ModemManager program.
    - and many more fixes...
- Changes from version 1.2.0:
  + Signal interface: new interface for extended signal quality
    information.
  + OMA interface: new interface to expose the Device Management
    capabilities defined by the Open Mobile Alliance.
  + Messaging interface: new 'Messages' property.
  + Modem interface: new 'Bearers' property.
  + 3GPP interface: new 'SubscriptionState' property.
  + Other notable changes include:
    - QMI: Implemented Manual CDMA activation logic.

    - MediaTek: new 'mtk' plugin added for MediaTek devices.
    - libmm-glib: Added GObject Introspection and Vala support.
    - and many more fixes...

- Add rcModemManager symlink.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 20 08:29:18 UTC 2014 - lnussel@suse.de

- Add ModemManager-1.0.0-systemd-activation.patch: Fix systemd dbus
  activation (bnc#892682). Systemd does not honor Alias= lines in
  install sections; that only works if the service file in question
  is actually enabled. So the dbus service file must refer to
  ModemManager.service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 23 03:34:04 UTC 2014 - rlmu@suse.com

- Added bnc878066-serial-ports-on-the-IO-card-are-not-responding.patch
  Fixed bnc#878066:
  4810-350 (Jaspar) and 4800-783 (Keystone Hi) serial ports on the IO card are not responding

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 11:59:13 UTC 2014 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- As we enabled pkgconfig(qmi-glib) and pkgconfig(mbim-glib)
  BuildRequires (last change), it's arguably also a good idea to
  replace --without-qmi and --without-mbim configure parameters
  with their --with-qmi and --with-mbim counterparts (and thus
  actually really enable the support).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  1 17:04:45 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Enable pkgconfig(qmi-glib) and pkgconfig(mbim-glib)
  BuildRequires, as we now have a package for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 30 20:09:44 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Run %udev_rules_update if such macro is defined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 10 12:26:41 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Enable the ModemManager service. In essence, it's a D-Bus
  service so enabling it in systemd only means to make it known
  and activatable (bnc#839067).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 19 14:46:25 UTC 2013 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.0:

  for now).
- Stop passing --with-pppd-plugin-dir=$pppddir to configure, not
  reqcognized anymore.
- Add pkgconfig(systemd) BuildRequires, new dependency.
- Add systemd ModemManger.service to pre, preun, post and postun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 21 13:31:36 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org
