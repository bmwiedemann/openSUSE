- Update to 4.0.1 (bsc#1242704):
  - Add Cygwin support.
  - Update config.guess and config.sub to the latest versions.
  - Fix pkg-config files for custom paths.
  - Set LD/LDXX unconditionally to CC/CXX, since LDFLAGS/LDXXFLAGS from ./configure rely on it.
- Update to 4.0.0:
  - sync soversion and major_version
  - The added number formatting feature requires an ABI change,
    hence the increase to SOVERSION=4.
  - Packagers outside of the Linux distributions sometimes use
    the major version number as the equivalent of SOVERSION on
    their platforms and have an incorrect SOVERSION for 2.5.1,
    which requires SOVERSION=3.
  - While SOVERSION is not required to match the major
    version number (example: glibc), mpdecimal will from
    now on take the path of least resistance and always use
    SOVERSION=MPD_MAJOR_VERSION.
  - The jump to 4.0.0 should also remind users that a C++ library
    is available.
  - Support for out-of-tree build.
  - Support for pkg-config.
  - Unix: support for Loongson.
  - Unix: support for CheriBSD.
  - Compilers: support for icx, icpx, ibm-clang_r, ibm-clang++_r,
    CompCert, clang-cl and emscripten.
  - Windows: support for MSYS2/MinGW.
  - MSVC: the build now uses /O2 /DNDEBUG.
  - MSVC: new arm64/arm32 cross build scripts.
  - AIX: the shared libraries are now installed as versioned
    objects, e.g., shr4.o, shr4_64.o.
  - New ./configure switches:
  - --enable-static: enable/disable the build of the static
    libraries (default: enabled).
  - --enable-pc: enable/disable the install of the pkgconfig
    files (default: enabled).
  - --enable-doc: enable/disable the install of the documentation
    (default: enabled).
  - New man pages direct users to the mpdecimal-doc package or
    the online HTML documentation.
  - The prebuilt HTML documentation is now in the separate
    mpdecimal-doc package, which gives distributions that reject
    prebuilt documentation the option to disregard it and use the
    new man pages.
  - libmpdec:
    - Add the “z” format specifier (coerce negative zeros to
      positive).
    - In extremely rare cases the transcendental functions (exp,
      ln, log10) did not set the Subnormal/Underflow flags. The
      reason is that in the case of an exponent boundary the Ziv
      correction loop for correct rounding requires very few
      iterations to arrive at the correctly rounded result, but
      may need many more iterations to arrive at the correct
      flags.
    - In these cases, Subnormal/Underflow is not very
      informative, so the status quo was to skip the extra
      iterations.
    - Version 4.0.0 now specializes exponent boundary cases
      and uses up to five additional iterations to set
      Subnormal/Underflow. The refactored code has no speed
      penalty on average; in fact, in the deccheck tests (random
      tests with a bias towards corner cases) it is slightly
      faster.
    - No cases have been found where more than two additional
      iterations are required, but they may exist.
    -eability fixes
    - mpd_qset_string_exact(), mpd_qset_i64_exact() and
      mpd_qset_u64_exact() can now be called with a nonzero
      status. Previously, the functions could return
      NaN/Invalid_operation in that case.
    - This is listed under “reliability fixes” since there is
      no possible scenario under which these functions would
      legitimately be called with a nonzero status.
  - libmpdec++
    - Add input validation for Decimal.shiftl(), Decimal.shiftr()
      and Decimal::ln10().

- Switch on _multibuild with the separate test step (to minimize
  dependencies).
- Add a basic baselibs.conf.
