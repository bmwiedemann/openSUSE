  <title>A MIME-Capable Implementation of the mailx Command</title>
  <description>Nail is a mail user agent derived from Berkeley Mail 8.1.  It is
intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX.2 mailx command with
additional support for MIME messages, POP3, and SMTP.  In recent system
environments, nail is Unicode/UTF-8 capable.  Further, it contains some
minor enhancements like the ability to set a &quot;From:&quot; address.</description>
