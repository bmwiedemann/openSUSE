  <title>Tool to provide defaults for which MPI implementation to use</title>
  <description>A simple tool that allows system administrators to set a site-wide
default for which MPI implementation is to be used, but also allow
users to set their own defaults MPI implementation, thereby overriding
the site-wide default.

The default can be changed easily via the mpi-selector command --
editing of shell startup files is not required.</description>
