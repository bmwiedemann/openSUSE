  <title>Tool for creating and verifying file hierarchies</title>
  <description>This project is a port of FreeBSD's very useful mtree utility to Linux
and other operating systems.

The mtree utility compares the file hierarchy rooted in the current
directory against a specification read from the standard input. Messages
are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics
do not match the specifications, or which are missing from either the
file hierarchy or the specification.

This port of mtree uses the autoconf infrastructure to maintain portability.
