%description
The %{name} utility compares the file hierarchy rooted in the current
directory against a specification read from the standard input. Messages
are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics do
not match the specifications, or which are missing from either the file
hierarchy or the specification.

Note: This is an older FreeBSD version of mtree; a newer NetBSD version
is also available in the package "nmtree".
