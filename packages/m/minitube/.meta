  <title>A native YouTube client.</title>
  <description>Minitube is a native YouTube client. With it you can watch YouTube videos in a new way: you type a keyword, Minitube gives you an endless video stream. Minitube does not require the Flash Player.

Minitube is not about cloning the original Youtube web interface, it strives to create a new TV-like experience.
