  <title>A terminal email client</title>
  <description>Matcha is a terminal email client for users who prefer keyboards
over mice and terminals over browsers.

It is built with Go and the Bubble Tea TUI framework. It supports
email providers such as Gmail and iCloud. Mail can be read, composed
and managed entirely from the command line.
