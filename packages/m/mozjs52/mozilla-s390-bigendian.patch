     dnl We won't build ICU data as a separate file when building
     dnl JS standalone so that embedders don't have to deal with it.
     dnl We also don't do it on Windows because sometimes the file goes
     dnl missing -- possibly due to overzealous antivirus software? --
     dnl which prevents the browser from starting up :(
