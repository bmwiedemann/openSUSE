- update to 10.26:
  * Changed: Added decoding support for version 4.11 files. There
    have been a couple reports of them. I don't know where they
    came from, but they verify using the latest code. Please share
    if you know about the origins.
  * Changed: Made use of a new APE_INFO_MD5_MATCHES test during
    quick verify. This way reading the MD5 is wrapped up nicely.
  * NEW: Added APE_INFO_MD5 to the info object because a
    third-party developer wanted it.
  * Fixed: 32-bit ARM could crash because it was enabling an
    intrinsic that was not available.
  * Fixed: Little endian AIFF files would not encode properly.
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.4.
  * Changed: Updated the copyrights to 2024.
  * Changed: The check for AIFF / AIFC in file headers was
    incorrectly allowing other things to pass.
  * Changed: Added a License.txt file by the installer that gets
    copied to the install path (also included in the SDK).
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.2.
  * Changed: Added a license link to the help menu.
  * Changed: Changed a few variables to have APE_ names because
    JRiver was having compile problems (Objective C doesn't care
    that things are in a namespace).
  * NEW: Added the ability to convert tags to legacy ID3v1 in the
    console program (my car stereo needs this).
  * Changed: Switched to the three clause BSD license to simplify
    inclusion of the source code.
  * Fixed: Getting a large APE tag field could return a buffer size
    that was too small so the next get would fail.
  * Changed: Tuned the error handling a little more.
  * Fixed: A corrupt frame could put the decoder into an endless
    loop trying the frame again which made players like Winamp, MC,
    etc. hang (feedback appreciated).
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.2.
  * Fixed: The AVX-512 code could fail to compile on some systems.
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.1.
  * Changed: Enabled reference optimization which makes the build smaller.
  * Changed: Updated to WavPack 5.6.4.
  * Changed: Simplified the license agreement to make it easier for
    inclusion in other projects.
  * Changed: Updated to version 2.79 of the ALAC tool.
  * Changed: The button images are created only once instead of
    again for the options dialog (slightly faster).
  * Changed: Winamp settings are stored in a section marked APE
    Plugin Settings when writing to the Winamp INI file.
  * Changed: Workaround a few NOLINT markers.
  * Changed: Improved ARM support.
  * Changed: Switched the size of the float transform to int64 to
    avoid overflows.
  * Changed: Made whole file reading cap 200 MB for 32-bit and
    64-bit instead of switching.
  * Intel SSE/AVX optimizations are now selected at runtime based
    on CPU capbilities.
  * Added SSE4.1 and AVX2 optimizations for 24/32 coding.
  * Added ARM Neon optimizations.
  * Improved existing SSE2 and AVX2 optimizations for improved
    performance.
  * General optimizations for improved performance.
  * NEW: Switched to the CMake build system for non-Windows and
    MinGW/MSYS builds.

- Version 8.92 (October 7, 2022)
 - Changed: Moved that the APE namespace is being used into CPP files instead of the global header.
 - Fixed: The Console header was relying upon undefined types, now correctly includes All.h (thanks Valérian Sibille).
 - Fixed: NoWindows.h now defines TCHAR, LPTSTR, LPCTSTR outside of the APE namespace like on Windows (thanks Valérian Sibille).
- Version 8.91 (October 7, 2022)
 - Changed: Worked through the rest of the Clang-Tidy warnings.
 - Changed: Turned on whole program optimization for the DirectShow filter (already on for everything else).
 - Fixed: With the non-Windows standard file reader, reads that didn't read any bytes would be reported as successful, causing FFmpeg pipes to hang forever after reaching the end of the input file (thanks Valérian Sibille).

- Version 8.90 (September 29, 2022)
 - Changed: Updated to a new certificate for signing that's good for three more years.
 - Changed: Use nullptr and override under MSVC.
 - Changed: Switched the CRC code to use a table defined in the code instead of running code to build the table (makes startup a little cleaner and faster).
 - Changed: Worked through some more Clang-Tidy warnings.
 - Changed: When verifying an APL file, it will slow verify in all cases since it's just a small chunk of a big file (instead of checking the big file quick).
 - Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.5.
