    <comment>- update to 10.26:
  * Changed: Added decoding support for version 4.11 files. There
    have been a couple reports of them. I don't know where they
    came from, but they verify using the latest code. Please share
    if you know about the origins.
  * Changed: Made use of a new APE_INFO_MD5_MATCHES test during
    quick verify. This way reading the MD5 is wrapped up nicely.
  * NEW: Added APE_INFO_MD5 to the info object because a
    third-party developer wanted it.
  * Fixed: 32-bit ARM could crash because it was enabling an
    intrinsic that was not available.
  * Fixed: Little endian AIFF files would not encode properly.
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.4.
  * Changed: Updated the copyrights to 2024.
  * Changed: The check for AIFF / AIFC in file headers was
    incorrectly allowing other things to pass.
  * Changed: Added a License.txt file by the installer that gets
    copied to the install path (also included in the SDK).
  * Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.2.
  * Changed: Added a license link to the help menu.
  * Changed: Changed a few variables to have APE_ names because
    JRiver was having compile problems (Objective C doesn't care
    that things are in a namespace).
  * NEW: Added the ability to convert tags to legacy ID3v1 in the
    console program (my car stereo needs this).
  * Changed: Switched to the three clause BSD license to simplify
    inclusion of the source code.
  * Fixed: Getting a large APE tag field could return a buffer size
    that was too small so the next get would fail.
  * Changed: Tuned the error handling a little more.</comment>
