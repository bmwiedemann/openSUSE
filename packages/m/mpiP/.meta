  <title>mpiP: a lightweight profiling library for MPI applications.</title>
  <description>
    mpiP is a lightweight profiling library for MPI applications. Because
    it only collects statistical information about MPI functions, mpiP
    generates considerably less overhead and much less data than tracing
    tools. All the information captured by mpiP is task-local. It only
    uses communication during report generation, typically at the end of
    the experiment, to merge results from all of the tasks into one output
    file.
