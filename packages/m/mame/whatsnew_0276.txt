-util/chd.cpp: Hacked around GitHub #13029 (issues creating delta CHDs). [Vas Crabb]
 * The code depends on getting away with trying to read at least one hunk past the end of the parent CHD.  Previously it just
    ignored any errors from reading the parent CHD, but adding error checking broke it.
 * This hack just ignores that specific error.  Also cleaned up some gross flow control and made more things const.
 * The code should obviously be fixed properly, but that's non-trivial. This gets it to a state no worse than it was in 0.270.

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: General cleanup, no functional changes. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Minor fixes and optimisations: [Vas Crabb]
 * Clear V/Z/S bits in flags register after SETFLGS or RESTORE.  These flags are kept in the native NZCV register, and SAVE assumes
    the corresponding bits in the flags register are clear.
 * Don't use an extra temporary register for SETFMOD with operand loaded from memory.  It doesn't allow additional parallelism
    anyway.
 * Slightly optimised generated code for GETFLGS.
 * Avoid a redundant TST when flags are requested for the non-optimised ROLAND case.  Also avoid unnecessarily updating flags when
    not requested.
 * Don't update flags for ADD/ADDC/SUB/SUBB/AND if not requested.  Slightly reduces pressure on the NZCV register.
 * Added TODO notes for opportunities to use CSEL/FCSEL rather than conditional branches.

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Optimised conditional operations using carry flag. (#13484) [Vas Crabb]
 * Track the state of the native carry flag to avoid unnecessarily manipulating the native NZCV register.  If the native carry flag
    does not correspond to the UML carry flag, test the bit in the flags register for the C and NC conditions.
 * Use condition select instructions to implement conditional forms of MOV and FMOV when advantageous.
 * Fixed EXIT with C/NC/A/BE condition not working properly if it doesn't immediately follow a CMP or SUB.  Extended reach of
    conditional EXIT to +/-128MiB (was +/-1MiB for conditions other than U/NU).
 * Moved code to set up skipping conditional instructions to a common function.
 * Use TBZ/TBNZ for short backward jumps with U/NU/C/NC conditions to save one instruction and a temporary register.
 * Simplified/optimised ADD[C]/SUB[B] code generation - avoids an unnecessary register copy when one operand is in memory and the
    other is a small immediate value.  Also fixed another unnecessary register copy for SUB[B] when an operand is kept in a host
    register.
 * Slightly optimised generated code for AND immediate.

-Miscellaneous minor stuff: [Vas Crabb]
 * scripts/minimaws: Set option strict for JavaScript code.
 * util/mfpresolve.h: Be explicit about turning nullptr into a pointer to data.
 * cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Reduced number of temporary registers used for AND with some operand combinations.

 * cpu/uml.cpp: Handle some more cases where ROLAND can be turned into AND in the simplifier.
 * cpu/drcbearm.cpp, cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Fixed a number of cases where 4-byte operations wouldn't clear the upper half of the
    destination (there are plenty more of these caused by the simplifier that will be harder to fix).
 * cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Fixed some cases where a conditional MOV could unexpectedly clear the upper bits of the destination.
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Improved code generation for various arithmetic and logical operations.  More AND/OR/XOR/ADD/ADDC operand
    combinations are optimised.  Special cases of ROLAND/ROLINS are optimised.
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Don't treat operands to FADD/FMUL as commutative. This isn't true when one is a NaN.

-Some relatively simple recompiler optimisations: [Vas Crabb]
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid a lot of unnecessary flag manipulation on shift/rotate operations.  Don't calculate flags when not
    requested. Don't preserve carry in for operations that don't use it as an input.
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid loading CL when ECX can be used.  Loading CL doesn't clear the upper bits, so it depends on the previous
    value of RCX, causing pipeline dependencies.  Loading ECX can grab a fresh rename register.
 * cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Attempt more optimisation on one more load immediate operation.
 * cpu/e132xs: Get rid of a redundant TEST - ROLAND can set the Z flag.

-cpu/e132xs, cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Recompiler fixes and optimisations: [Vas Crabb]
 * cpu/e132xs.cpp: Refactored code generation to improve performance and fixed some issues:
   - Moved a considerable amound of logic from execution time to code generation time.
   - Fixed some cases where add/subtract carry was being interpreted incorrectly.
   - Fixed a case where a load double intruction was incorrectly writing the same register twice.
   - Use UML flags to generate condition codes for addition/subtraction.
   - Use UML carry flag for carry-/borrow-in.
   - Reduced UML register pressure (improves performance for hosts with fewer callee-saved CPU registers).
   - Moved more logic to helper functions to simplify maintenance.
     * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Fixed upper bits of UML registers being cleared when used as address offset for LOAD/STORE.
     * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Don't do expensive zero/sign flag update for shift operations if only carry flag will be used.
     * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Reduced copy/paste in READ[M]/WRITE[M] generators.

    Exception Points" doesn't actually work.
