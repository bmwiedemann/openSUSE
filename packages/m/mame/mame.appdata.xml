    <p>
      MAME is an emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game
      systems in software on modern personal computers. The source code to
      MAME serves as this hardware documentation. The fact that the
      software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the
      documentation.

    <p>
      This package is the combined arcade only build. If you want MESS you must
      install MAME-MESS.
