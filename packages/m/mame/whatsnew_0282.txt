-update element order in four more Yamaha keyboard layouts (#14194) [Devin Acker]

-goldstar.cpp driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]
 * A huge work on tilemap system, machines config, memory maps, video start, screen update, tile get info, gfxdecode and different
    video registers to give extended graphics support (mostly girls) to Poker Master and derivative hardwares. Now the sets that
    support girls are pkmasta, missbingo, missbingoc, crazybon, crazybona, and crazybonb,

-goldstar.cpp driver improvements. [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]
 * New machine config for 3 Cards Poker 96.
 * Correct settings for NVRAM.
 * Bypassed the 3 Cards Poker 96 protections.

---------------------------
3 Cards Poker 96 (V1.6) [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]
3 Cards Poker 96 (V1.0) [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]

-video/ym7101.cpp: fix name tables with uppermost bit discarded in 64 KiB mode [angelosa]

-emu/ioport.cpp: Removed the "optional" field flag. [Vas Crabb]
 * There are multiple issues with this flag:
   - It's poorly defined.  Is it an input that's software-accessible but not used?  Is it an input that shows in test modes but
      doesn't do anything useful?  Is it an input that the system can be configured to not use?  Is it an input that is useful but
      not strictly necessary?
   - In almost a decade, it hasn’t been used widely.  It was used in less than ten places.  There hasn't been substantial interest
      in actually applying it across the codebase.
   - It would be an absolute nightmare to try and apply to mahjong and hanafuda games.  Consider all the cases where a game may use
      some but not all of the double-up game controls, and some games support multiple control schemes that use different subsets of
      the standard mahjong matrix.
   - Trying to apply it to gambling systems would also be a minefield.
   - If we were to expect it to be applied, it would cause an eplosion in input port definitions for platforms with multiple games,
      adding further maintenance burden.  It would greatly reduce the value of having things like the standard mahjong panel
      definitions as you'd rarely actually be able to use them as-is.

-att6300p.cpp: Initial driver for AT&T 6300 Plus (#14149) [donohoe00]
 * cpu/i86/i86.cpp: Avoid clearing working registers upon device reset
   - This change is required in order for BIOS for the AT&T 6300 Plus to work.
   - The 6300 Plus has external logic to reset the 80286 via the reset pin, so that it can return to Real Mode from protected mode.
      Upon return to Real Mode, the BIOS code is clearly depending on the fact that SP register is preserved upon reset (the BIOS
      does however explicitly load the SS register after reset, before it is used).
   - The 8086 and 80286 documentation call out which registers are to be initialized upon reset, and SS is one of them.  For AX, BX,
      CX, DX, BP, SP, SI and DI, the behaviour is not specified.  However, based on what the 6300 Plus BIOS is doing, it appears the
      actual hardware behaviour is to leave them untouched.  Although we can only be fully confident that the real 286 behaves this
      way with respect to the SP register, it's likely that the other registers which do not have explicitly defined initialization
      behavior are also not touched during reset.
   - Note that this observed behaviour only pertains to reset via the reset pin, and not to power-on initialization.

-formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: add write support for the D13 format (#14214) [Roman Donchenko]
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: make a2_{13,16}sect_format inherit from a common base class
   - Also, replace hardcoded sector counts by constants and/or variables. There is not much point in the `m_nsect` variable right
      now, but it'll become more useful in a future commit.
 * formats/ap2_dsk.cpp: refactor a2_16sect_format::save
 * extract fragments that would be different for the 13-sector format into separate functions;
 * extract repeated expressions into variables;
 * merge `pos` and `wrap` into a struct;
   - For simplicity of implementation, this makes a minor behavior change: when the current sector is of the wrong DOS version, we
      now start searching for the next sector at the position after the address postamble, rather than after the data preamble (IOW,
      we rewind the current position, which we didn't do before). This shouldn't make much difference in practice.

 * The code has been in this state ever since it's been added in 36ea482a, so it seems unlikely that it'll improve. Moreover, its
    utility seems questionable: I haven't been able to find a single floppy image with an .rti extension (and there are none listed
    in the software list). OTOH, for every game mentioned in the description, there are WOZ images that can be used instead (except
    for The Toy Shop, which has DSK images).

-bus/qbus: Get DVK card implementation detals out of headers. [Vas Crabb]

-g65816: fix status flag display in emulation mode (#14279) [arekkusu42]
 * In emulation mode, "MX" are " B".  Both bits are always 1, only the semantic meaning changes: " " doesn't exist, and "B" is only
    meaningful when pushed during an IRQ/NMI, to distinguish from BRK.
 * No functional change.

-apple2gs: Improve IRQ emulation  (#14277) [arekkusu42]
 * g65816: fix IRQ to be level triggered
   - Followup b3f2535: stop clearing LINE_IRQ when jumping to the IRQ vector. Properly written IRQ handlers won't notice any
      difference, but this fixes the behavior for software which (possibly intentionally) fails to clear an IRQ source; in that case
      the IRQ should continue to trigger (probably leading to a system hang.)
   - LINE_SO is generally not hooked up, but if it is, it doesn't raise IRQ.
   - Also delete unused G65816_INT_* macros.
 * apple2gs: improve VGC/MegaII IRQ emulation
   - All of the VGC and MegaII IRQ sources set their status bits even when the corresponding IRQ is not enabled (this was only
      implemented for SCB).
   - Clearing enable bits works differently between VGC and MegaII: the MegaII can lower the IRQ line (when all sources are clear),
      the VGC does not. Neither clears their corresponding status bits.
   - VGCINTCLEAR reads the floating bus.  Status bits (and IRQs) are only cleared when writing a zero.
   - ADB reset needs to clear (at least) m_irqmask.
   - Also cleanup CLRVBLINT into do_io().
 * apple2gs: implement undocumented MegaII interaction
   - Reading the C02E/C02F counters resets the SCB status bit in C023 (the same as writing to C032).
   - This behavior is not documented by Apple, but was verified on hardware.
   - Move the relevant logic into a helper, to avoid code duplication.
 * apple2gs: improve C019 VBL behavior
   - Ensure that VBL is cleared on scanline 0 and set on scanline 192, even in SHR.
 * apple2gs: remove IOUDIS, fix AN3 and paddle
   - Followup 6a4854b: IOUDIS only exists on the IIc and IIc+.
   - AN2/3 are set by ROM during boot, and AN3 is readable via C046.
   - Also followup 23904ff: paddle only triggers on r/w of C070, and it reads the floating bus.
 * apple2gs: reduce do_io() log spam
   - 16-bit writes in demos were tripping "unknown switch".
   - No functional change.
 * apple2gs: update stale link

   - Only the mirror is required to fix double-lo-res: ROM@F3CB reads C079.
 * apple2e: IOUDIS and RDDHIRES only exist on the IIc
   - Followup 6a4854b: hardware testing shows that IOUDIS and RDDHIRES don't exist on the IIe (despite what Apple copy-pasted into
      the IIe Technical Reference.)
   - Replace the implementation with documentation and an assert, to inform future developers.
 * apple2video: rename dhires_w to reduce confusion
   - dhires state is set (inverted) by writing to AN3.  Following the naming convention of the other state setters eliminates the
      confusing case where dhires_w(get_dhires()) was not the identity function.
   - No functional change.

-ef9345: Fix TS9347 font rendering and IND ROM command (#14313) [Fabio D'Urso]
 * ef9345.cpp supports both the EF9345 and the TS9347 video chips.
   - In 40-column mode, unlike the EF9345, the TS9347 does not have dedicated fonts for accented characters. Instead, the bit that
      on the EF9345 would select those fonts is reused for a different purpose (the i2 flag, currently unimplemented). Before this
      commit, we were still interpreting this bit as if on the EF9345 and selecting the accented fonts. This commit ensures that the
      bit is ignored both while rendering and in the ROM access command (IND ROM).
   - In 80-column mode, the TS9347 maps the ranges that the EF9345 would interpret as mosaic characters to a different set of
      regular characters and symbols. This commit ensures we render them correctly.
     * The new font ROM referenced by the minitel2 machine (TS9347-based) has been checked with the real hardware.

-Added emulation of a CEM3320-based 4th-order LPF, and used it on the linndrum.  (#14264) [m1macrophage]

 * Added a generic 4-th order LPF (VA_LPF4), based on the implementation in esq1.cpp.
 * Added a CEM3320_LPF4 specialization.
 * Used the CEM3320_LPF4 on the linndrum.
 * Implemented the corresponding VCF envelope generators on the linndrum.
 * Fixed alignment, made comments more resilient to code changes.
 * linndrum.cpp: Use pre-existing constant for VCF EG capacitor.

-esq5505.cpp and esqpump.cpp: Route es5505 bus to a separate 'aux' stereo output. (#14333) [Christian Brunschen]
 * The VFX-SD and later keyboards in the family have not only a main stereo output, but also a second 'aux' stereo output that

   - Implement `sanguo5` / `tunshi` mapper (uses SRAM with invalid header);
   - Implement `sportg` Tectoy 3-in-1 mapper;
   - Hookup SRAM in `yasech` mapper;
   - fix `btlchess` mapper;
   - Implement `16mj2` extra ports reads;
   - Fix `sampras` hanging on menu (uses a J-Cart variant);
   - Hookup J-Cart for `sskid`;
   - Allow `ninjab` to boot with proper I2C mapper;
   - Fix I2C mappers for `billwlsh`,  `madden93`, `madd93ce`, `shanewar`;
   - Add SRAM for `mightmg3`;
   - Fix `beggarp1`, it relocates SRAM address more akin to sf002/wukong mapper;
   - Fix `barkley2`: it uses mirroring for SRAM, crashing in tournament mode if it doesn't find it;
   - `sonic3` "fram" area doesn't exist anymore, use "sram" instead;
   - Retire `rom_radica` from legacy handling: it has been moved as standalone sega/megadriv_rad.cpp driver starting from #3108
   - Retire `rom_topf` from legacy handling: was a broken version of `rom_lion3`;
     * machine/i2cmem: add 24C65 alias for bighurt/brianl96/collslam/shanewar [Angelo Salese, Happy]
     * move M95320 implementation from legacy stm32 into actual device

-apple2e: cleanup IIc (#14388) [arekkusu42]
 * apple2e: IIc does not have internal gameio
   - Followup #14307: the IIc (and clones based on this form factor) do not have an internal 16-pin gameio port, and the
      annunciators are not routed to the external joystick connector, thus devices such as gizmo and compeyes can't work.
 * apple2e: remove c000_iic_w()
   - Only C078-7F have IIc-specific behavior.  Handle them in common c000_w, to reduce copy-paste.  Three functional changes:
 * Zip Chip C058-5F now work in a non-plus IIc
 * Zip Chip C058-5F now side-effect annunciators on the IIe
 * C07X now side-effect paddle timers and VBL interrupt on the IIc
 * apple2e: collapse c000_iic_r()
   - Following the pattern of c000_laser_r(), reduce c000_iic_r() to the minimum set of IIc-specific softswitches and rely on
      c000_r() for the rest.  Three functional changes:
 * unconnected joysticks now read properly (8021d6b missed the IIc)
 * Zip Chip C05B now works the same on the IIc and the IIe
 * RDIOUDIS/RDDHIRES now side-effect paddle timers and VBL interrupt
 * apple2e: fix IIc VBL behavior
   - C019 on the IIc behaves quite differently than the IIe or IIgs; it does not signify that the beam is in VBL, rather it
      signifies that a VBL IRQ has fired.  This happens when the beam reaches VBL, but only if C05B ENVBL is set, and C019 remains
      set until manually cleared via accessing C07X.  This is similar to how C041 and C047 work on the IIgs.
   - Also fix a logic error in laser_mouse_r() breaking VBL polling.
 * apple2e: fix IIc C04x readback
   - Fix C04x to return the floating bus in the low 7 bits, matching behavior verified on hardware.
 * apple2e: remove redundant m_cassette_out
   - C020 now works identically reading or writing, the same as apple2.

------------------
Mephisto (set 1) [Berger]

-Update hiscore.rst with plugin configuration details (#14403) [aaciii]
 * Updated plugin documentation to cover the new ability to exclude games from the hiscore support.

-wozfdc.cpp: improve timing of data register reads (#14404) [Roman Donchenko]
 * When one of the even-numbered c08x locations is read, the FDC returns the value of its data register. However, its LSS (logic
    state sequencer) runs fast enough that between when the CPU puts the address on the bus and when it reads the result, it manages
    to complete one cycle. This is explained in Understanding the Apple II, page 9-22.
 * This patch emulates this behavior. Its effect can be seen with the INIT command in DOS 3.2 and earlier. Without the patch, the
    command fails with an I/O error; with the patch, it succeeds. The reason is that it checks if the disk is write-protected after
    formatting every track, so it executes the following instructions while the FDC is in write mode:
 * lda $c08d,x lda $c08e,x bmi error
 * The way it's supposed to work is:
 * 1. The second LDA instruction switches the FDC to "check write protect" mode. 2. The LSS runs for 1 cycle, which loads the
    write-protect status into the data register. 3. The data register is copied into A, which puts the write-protect status into the
    N flag. 4. The BMI instruction tests the status.
 * Without step 2, the N flag is loaded with whatever was in the high bit of the data register, which seems to be 1 more often than
    not, so DOS thinks the disk is write-protected, and aborts.

-apple: slightly improve Zip Chip emulation (#14397) [arekkusu42]
 * apple2gs: fix Zip Chip inconsistencies
   - Followup #9503: fix the ZipGS enable/disable to work correctly, and not re-lock.  Also properly initialize the paddle delay,
      which has been verified against hardware to work the same way as the Zip Chip documentation (not reversed.)  Also consistently
      side-effect the annunciators.
   - This fixes errors visible in the ZipGS CDA/CDEV.
 * apple: improve Zip Chip C05B
   - Implement the disable and delay status bits.  Now software can detect the current enable state of the Zip, so the user's
      boot-time preference can be restored, instead of blindly enabling or disabling.
