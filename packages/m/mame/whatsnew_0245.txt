-Add support for Space Duel’s cocktail mode. (#9828) [Ian Eure]
 * Add support for Space Duel’s cocktail mode.
   - This change introduces a cabinet type setting which allows Space Duel to be placed into cocktail mode.  When run in a cocktail
      cabinet, the game:
     * Strobes the invert x & invert y outputs to rotate the video 180 degrees.  This is necessary because the monitor in the SD
        cocktail is mounted upside-down relative to the upright.
     * Draws the player 2 score in an orientation where they can be read by the second player, who stands on the opposite side of
        the cabinet as player one.
   - In addition to the driver support, I had to implement video flipping in avg_device, as it didn’t support it.

-Removed device_timer, device_timer_id, et al in favor of direct callback members. (#9788) [MooglyGuy]
 * Primarily, this removes device_t::device_timer, device_t::timer_set, device_t::synchronize, device_t::timer_expired, and
    device_timer_id. Use of device_timer often resulted in unnecessary trampolining in addition to switch/case overhead on a
    driver/device level, and additional logic to manage delegated vs. ID-based timers on a core level.  In the worst cases, devices
    were performing a switch/case with only one valid case.
 * device_scheduler::timer_set is marked deprecated as the only remaining direct uses are via the Lua engine and a few drivers that
    need refactoring anyway.  The remaining uses occur via device_scheduler::synchronize.
 * As a middle ground between the extremely short timer_alloc() and the extremely long
    machine().scheduler().timer_alloc(timer_expired_delegate(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this)), a helper function in
    device_t has been added which can be invoked with the following syntax: timer_alloc(FUNC(widget_device::contoso_tick), this)

New machines added as MACHINE_NOT_WORKING
-----------------------------------------
Tinker Bell [Darksoft, Team Europe, R. Belmont]

-segam1.cpp: removed and games merged into the new segasm1.cpp. [R. Belmont]

-ega: palette and memory map fixes [cracyc]

-spi_sdcard: Added CMD1 SEND_OP_COND. [Nigel Barnes]
 * Fixed CMD10 R1 response, not idle.
 * Delay SPI response by 1 byte, required for MMFS.

 * Got Space Invaders specific stuff out of the Midway 8080 B/W base class.
 * Got some of the game-specific stuff out of the _8080bw_state class. It's still a bit of a mess because sound hardware is
    implemented in the driver classes so some games pull in a more derived class than they really should just for sound handlers.

    version as a proxy for standard library version is bad, but it's the path of least resistance for now).

-netlist/plib: Fix compile with Apple clang. [Vas Crabb]

-frontend/mame/infoxml.cpp: Work around an MSVCPRT shortcoming with promise types (see e.g. GitHub #9665). [Vas Crabb]

M3001 [Darksoft, Team Europe, R. Belmont]
M4001 [Darksoft, Team Europe, R. Belmont]

-Add missing segafruit.cpp source file. [R. Belmont]

-rename headonb.cpp to efg8080.cpp [hap]

-Fixed Arcade build (#9912) [MASH]
 * Added missing segafruit.cpp to Arcade build filter.

-mess.lua: place hh_ collection drivers and their subclasses together [hap]

-ui, docs: Added menus to fill a couple of gaps, improved consistency. (#9915) [Vas Crabb]
 * Added menus for controlling toggle inputs, and showing recognised input devices and control state.  Moved input menu options off
    main menu to a submenu, as there are a lot of them now.
 * Moved menu heading drawing into base class, added headings to more menus, and made headings more consistent with the menu items
    used to reach them.  Also made terminology more consistent.
 * Changed the default names for buttons and hat switches/D-pads to use 1-based numbering.  DirectInput still returns 0-based button
    numbers for some devices.
 * Removed local copy of MinGW xaudio2.h as it’s now included in the MSYS2 package.  Also fixed building the DirectSound sound
    output module with the SDL OSD on Windows - the Windows headers are sensitive to include order.
 * Started adding documentation for menus, to hopefully help people find menus they remember seeing but can't recall how to access.
 * For translators, this makes terminology more consistent.  In particular:
   - "Settings" is preferred over "configuration" in a number of places, as the latter can be construed as referring specifically to
      settings stored in .cfg files in the cfg_directory folder.  Also, references to saving machine configuration could be
      interpreted as relating to the settings on the "Machine Configuration" menu.
   - The controls on host input devices (e.g. keys, buttons, joystick axes) are referred to as "controls", while emulated inputs are
      referred to as "inputs".
   - The menus for assigning host controls to emulated inputs are called "input assignments" menus to distinguish them from other
      input settings menus.
   - Combinations of controls that can be assigned to emulated inputs are referred to as "combinations" rather than "sequences".
   - The potentially confusing term "ROM set" has been removed altogether. Use "short name" to refer to a device or system's
      identifier.
   - "System" is used in almost places to refer to a complete, runnable system rather than "Machine".
   - "Driver" is now only used to refer to source files where systems or devices are defined - it is no longer used to refer to
      individual systems.
   - A few more menus have message context for the messages.  This makes it a bit easier to guess where the messages are used.  It
      also means you can use different translations in different places if necessary (e.g. if the same English text should be
      translated differently as an item in one menu and as a heading in another).

-Changed the constructor of fs::dir_entry to take 'std::string &&name' instead of 'const std::string &name' (#9913) [npwoods]

Super Poker (V100xD03) / Formosa [Luca Elia, ANY]

-machine/dp83932c.cpp: Support BE mode and transmission packet appending (#9910) [Brice Onken]
 * Added support for big endian bus accesses by adjusting the width of the bus access appropriately.  (In 32-bit mode, descriptors
    and the RBA must all be aligned to 32-bit boundaries, even when the values are only 16 bit, thus the previous method had issues
    on BE buses.  See pages 7 and 15 in the datasheet.)
 * Stop device from starting a second transaction task if one is already in progress.  The datasheet recommends that software which
    wants to append packets during a transmission send another transmission command to avoid a race condition, and it should do
    nothing if this command is received while the transfer is still ongoing.  NEWS-OS 4.2.1aRD is an example of software that does
    this.  It would hang on boot without this change because the SONIC would start doing weird things when the second transmit
    command came in.

-sound.cpp: Fix missed samples due to state save (#9917) (#9918) [couriersud]
 * sound.cpp: Fix missed samples due to state save (#9917)
   - The PR address #9917. A save state may occur between time slices. Sound devices through sound.cpp are updated during a timer
      call every 20ms. When the state is saved, these devices are not updated to the current machine time. Consequently after a
      state load the devices have have a "time lag" since in postload buffer end time is forced to machine time. This change will
      save the last buffer end time so that all outstanding samples are processed.
   - This is a core change. I tested it on some drivers. This needs a very thorough review and I post the PR primarily to document a
      possible solution.
 * sound.cpp: use "stream.sound_stream" as module name for save_item

-netlist: fix bug, prepare for future changes and improve readability (#9947) [couriersud]
 * netlist: fix bug, prepare for future changes and improve readability
   - fix a bug where a net processing error may trigger a nullptr access
   - applied some clang-tidy recommendations
   - add no_return to plib::terminate
   - properly encapsulate dynamic_cast usage
   - more review of noexcept
   - added a clang-format file. Over time, all source files will be processed with clang-format
   - Used clang format on a number of files
   - Rewrote 74174
   - all device constructors now use a struct to pass data on to base classes. Neither netlist state nor the name are intended to be
      used in a constructor. After the base class was constructed, they can be accessed by state() and name().
   - The device construction macros can now be removed. Changes to the core will not need to be reflected in constructors.
   - Change truth table macros so that going forward NETLIST_END and TRUTH_TABLE_END can be replaced by a closing curly brace.
      netlists can than use curly braces enclosed blocks.
   - more clang-format
   - removed some macros completely
   - all derived classes from base_device_t now don't use macros any longer.
   - as a result, delegator_t was removed. This class was only used to support macros :-(

    machine configuration settings allowing several monitors to be selected.
 * Implemented the Macintosh Display Card's packed RGB mode.  The base/stride in RGB mode make more sense with this implemented.
 * Cleaned up the code for the SuperMac Spectrum cards, and fixed the garbage at the bottom of the screen on the Spectrum/8.
 * Put a layout with views for common monitor aspect ratios in a place where cards can use it.  This is especially useful for the
    NuBus cards that can support portrait monitors.
