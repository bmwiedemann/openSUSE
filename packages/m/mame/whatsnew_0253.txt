-m68040: Reduce error logging spam for some unemulated instructions [AJR]

-ncr53c90: Numerous fixes [AJR]
 * Prevent recursive stepping when scsi_ctrl_changed is called in the middle of a state (most likely by HLE SCSI devices programmed
    to respond instantly)
 * Add some calls to the state machine stepping handler for non-timeout conditions that may advance it, particularly non-DMA writes
    to the FIFO
 * Always wait for FIFO to have at least one byte before sending anything
 * Properly interpret configuration flag for Save Residual Byte 16-bit DMA mode
 * Use little-endian byte order for 16-bit DMA handlers, but add alternate byte-swapping handlers for convenient use with big-endian
    systems
 * Allow 16-bit DMA handlers to access just one byte in the FIFO rather than exit MAME with an exception
 * Always honor timeout for selection arbitration (previously any event could short-circuit it)
 * Allow side effects of read handlers to be disabled for debugging
   - macquadra700.cpp: Correct SCSI chip type and bus configuration mode

-hlsl: Fixed regression in distortion shader. [Ryan Holtz]

-m68000: move to sr/ccr must also update the internal flags (was preventing the Union Demo from booting) [Olivier Galibert]

-Update accumulating relative inputs exactly once per frame. [Vas Crabb]
 * This fixes "amplification" effects that would happen if the frame rate rose above 100 Hz (whether by unthrottling or otherwise).
 * Synchronise with wall clock any time inputs are read.  Not doing this has weird effects on relative inputs with frame skipping
    and contributes to unresponsiveness of menus.
 * Reduce visual latency for mouse movement on menus when paused or skipping frames.  The rest of the code changes to menus won't
    provide benefits until draw can happen after event handling.

-snk/hng64_sprite.ipp, snk/hng64_v.cpp: Improved Hyper Neo Geo 64 sprite drawing. (#10914) [David Haywood]
 * Render sprites to intermediate buffer buffer and blend when mixing (fixes sprite/sprite priorities).

-osd/modules/input: Modernised interface for enumerating DirectInput devices. [Vas Crabb]
 * Gets rid of some state in the winhybrid joystick module that's only used during initialisation.

-apple2gs.cpp: don't allow read of write-only switches, fixes MT08564 [Peter Ferrie]

-osd/modules/input: Always use DirectInput with desktop window in background mode. [Vas Crabb]
 * There are multiple issues with what MAME was doing, but the most glaring is that it violates the DirectInput interface contract
    that requires the window associated with an open device must not be destroyed.  See documentation for
    IDirectInputDevice8::SetCooperativeLevel: "This parameter must be a valid top-level window handle that belongs to the process.
    The window associated with the device must not be destroyed while it is still active in a DirectInput device."
 * The previous code also prevented DirectInput controllers from working when using multiple windows if any window other than the
    first window had focus.
 * Also fixed SDL builds not correctly recognising when all windows lose focus, and save state menu not appearing.

 * nichibutsu/jangou.cpp: Split into derived classes so all object finders are required and device_remove isn't necessary.  Also use
    the data pending callback on latches as it's there.
 * taito/taito_l.cpp: Use normal start/reset handlers rather than an elaborate maze of indirection.
 * vsystem/aerofgt.cpp: Split the driver class up a little.  It's still a mess.

-abc1600: Note failing tests. [Curt Coder]

-abc1600: Bring the mouse CPU online. [Curt Coder]

-Various updates, mostly around Lua: [Vas Crabb]
 * Compile Lua as C++.  When Lua is compiled as C, it uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling, resulting in failure to unwind
    intermediate stack frames.  Trying to ensure no objects with non-trivial destructors are in scope when raising a Lua error is
    error-prone.  In particular, converting an exception to a Lua error becomes convoluted, and raising a Lua error from a
    constructor is effectively impossible.
 * Updated Lua to 5.4.4 - this includes a brand-new garbage collector implementation with better performance.  The main thing
    removed is the deprecated bitlib.
 * Updated sol2 to version 3.3.0 - this adds support for Lua 5.4 and fixes a number of issues, including not correctly handling
    errors when Lua is built as C++.
 * Updated LuaFileSystem to version 1.8.0 - this adds support for symbolic links on Windows, as well as Lua 5.4 compatibility.
 * Updated LuaSQLite3 to version 0.9.5 - this fixes issues in multi-threaded environments, as well as Lua 5.4 compatibility.
 * Fixed double-free after attempting to construct a debugger expression from Lua with an invalid string, and exposed expression
    error to Lua in a better way.
 * Added warning level print function to Lua.
 * Fixed saving cheats with shift operators in expressions, although this code isn't actually used as there's no cheat editor.

-3rdparty: Avoid the need for -fpermissive since clang doesn't like it. [Vas Crabb]
 * I'll try to get some of this upstreamed.

New clones marked not working
-----------------------------
Bloxeed (bootleg) [porchy]

-sega/model3.cpp: fixed ROM loading for the oceanhun sets, they now boot and run with GFX glitches [Brian Troha]

-irem/m92.cpp: Added IC locations and PLDs to most sets, minor ROM label corrections.
 [The PLD Archive, Porchy, Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

-Updated forked linenoise to latest upstream. [Vas Crabb]
 * This removes the need to force it to build as C++, and adds proper UTF-8 support for Windows.
 * Since this is a fork of linenoise, there's no hope for getting lua-linenoise to sync with it upstream.  I made the bare minimum
    changes to keep it working, but didn't add bindings for new functionality (e.g. multi-line editing).

-Reduce warnings that need to be suppressed to build linenoise. [Vas Crabb]

-msx1_cart.xml: Moved the Albatross extended course tapes from msx1_cass.xml to msx1_cart.xml. (#10960) [wilbertpol]

 * Co-authored-by: Erik Newton <erik.newton@newteksoftware.co.uk>

-Lua engine: Better bindings for device_state_interface. [Vas Crabb]
 * This avoids creating a table every time the state property of a device is accessed, adds proper support for getting/setting
    floating/point state entries from Lua, calls the state entry's formatting method to convert to a string (for flags fields, etc.)
    and exposes more properties.

-hng64.cpp - add 'wraparound enable' bit to the tilemaps, this bit gets disabled on the fatal fury wild ambition title screen, and

Aka Zukin [Alberto Salso, Ignacio Seki, Angelo Salese]

-apple2video: fix monochrome DHGR rendering for RGB mode (GitHub #10975) [R. Belmont]

-apple2video: Better fix for the previous issue. Now also covers IIgs mono DHR and B&W monitor modes. [R. Belmont]

-pci.cpp: add new config read/write functions to support bridges that allow software to issue both Type 0 and Type 1 config
 addresses. [R. Belmont]
 * bandit.cpp: use the new functionality in pci.cpp. [R. Belmont]
 * macpci.cpp: Fix Grand Central PCI address now that we're interpreting the config address correctly. [R. Belmont]

-Retired the over-stretched "system type" flags. [Vas Crabb]
 * Functionally, the only difference between the system definitions is that GAMEL lets you specify an additional internal layout and
    SYST lets you specify a compatible system.  COMP and CONS are just aliases for SYST - the aliases can be phased out.
 * Removed arcade.flt and mess.flt altogether - opinion seems to be split between misinterpreting them as fully supported and
    considering them unnecessary.  They were marginally useful as a performance test for makedep.py, but that isn't important.  We
    still have nl.flt as an example .flt file (although it doesn't use "-" exclude directives).
 * Moved the UI active flag from the machine to the UI manager.  Nothing else uses it anyway (it's still accessible to scripts).

-luaengine.cpp: Hopefully fix clang builds. [Vas Crabb]

-luaengine.cpp: Try to get around the clang error, attempt two. [Vas Crabb]

-Various devices: Correct placement of U integer suffix in definitions of shifted LOG_xxx constant macros (continued from

 [Curt Coder]

-sinclair/tsconf.cpp: Added NeoGS sound card and Kempston mouse. (#11016) [holub]

-Lua engine: run everything in coroutines. (#11019) [Vas Crabb]
 * This lets you use emu.wait(...) directly without mucking around creating coroutines.
 * Allow emu.wait to accept an attotime argument.
 * Added a couple more wait helper functions.

-emu/profiler.h: Actually use scope-based profiling helpers. [Vas Crabb]
 * This makes the comment at the top of emu/profile.h less dishonest, and makes it easier to write exception-safe code.
 * Got rid of some do { ... } while (0) loops that only existed so break could be used like a goto.

-emu/profile.h: Hopefully convince clang that profile scope helpers are important even in non-profile builds. [Vas Crabb]

-bus/ISA: Added HP82321A BASIC Language coprocessor (#10926) [Sven Schnelle]
 * emu: add defer_access() method, which is useful for keeping the cpu in a loop restarting the current instruction to emulate
    waitstates.
 * add HP82321A Basic Language Coprocessor This adds support for the HP82321A Basic language coprocessor, which emulates a HP9816
    system with a 68K cpu. See http://www.hpmuseum.net/display_item.php?hw=681 for more details and software to run on this card.

-minimaws: Let command-line romident identify media inside zip archives. (#11024) [wilbertpol]

-Various optimisations to code generaton. [Vas Crabb]
 * util/bitmap.cpp, util/palette.cpp: Marked lots of things constexpr. Bitmaps don't throw exceptions on allocation failure, they
    just become invalid.  Almost nothing in MAME actually checks for this.
 * emu/profiler.cpp: Abort if the profile stack overflows rather than throwing an exception.  This is a developer feature and if it
    overflows, the code is broken.  Calling a noreturn noexcept function generates less code than throwing an exception, which adds
    up.
 * util/strformat.cpp: Traded away some unnecessary flexibility for more compact code.  The stream objects must derive from
    std::basic_ostream now - they can't just be any old objects with the expected operators.

-Pacify clang, and more noexcept. [Vas Crabb]

-astrocde.xml: Use lowercase for descriptive text in descriptions. (#11023) [ArcadeShadow]
