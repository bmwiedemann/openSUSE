Source changes
--------------
-Inerflip electromechanical slots major rewrite. [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo] Hooked all devices, inputs, outputs, reels mechs,
 internal layout with all parameters and working reels. Also added docs and technical notes. The machine is currently passing all
 the tests. [Roberto Fresca]

New systems marked not working
------------------------------
Jack Use (Jackpot settings for Interflip slots machines) [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]

-Internal layout for Interflip electromechanical slots. [Roberto Fresca]

-multibyte.h: Fix shift count bug in 48-bit and 64-bit big-endian functions [AJR]

-chdman.cpp, imgtool/modules: Use multibyte.h functions [AJR]

-Minor #include cleanup [AJR]

-Remove flopimg.h and fsmgr.h from floppy device header [AJR]

-nubus/nubus_asntmc3b.cpp: Updates [R. Belmont]
 * Updated and modernized, this was one of the first emulated NuBus cards and it showed.
 * Fixed missing save state for the on-card RAM.
 * Added Farallon EtherMac 30i-TH, an SE/30 PDS clone of these cards.
 * Added notes about how these cards are a Mac-ified version of the NE2000.
   - nubus/nubus.cpp: Allow PDS cards to choose their phantom NuBus slot. Cards have been observed impersonating slots 9, 0xC, and
      0xE. [R. Belmont]
   - apple/maciici.cpp, apple/rbv.cpp: Updates [R. Belmont]
 * Made maciisi expansion more correct: it has a single slot that can be adapted to take either a NuBus or an SE/30 compatible PDS
    card. The slot name is "siexp" and it now allows the use of any NuBus or SE/30 PDS card (tested with several video and Ethernet
    cards).
 * Modernized slot interrupt routing.

-solomon.cpp: VBLANK interrupt modernization; PSG type correction [AJR]

-funkybee.cpp: Remove PCB diagram (which belongs to the other skylncr); add note [AJR]

-adsp2100: Fix a couple of disassembly regressions [AJR]

 * apple/maclc.cpp, maclc3.cpp, macquadra605.cpp: Add LC PDS slots to machines that have them. [R. Belmont]
 * apple/sonora.cpp, apple/v8.cpp: Modernize slot/VIA2 IRQ inputs. [R. Belmont]

 * render/drawbgfx.cpp: Return an error if Wayland EGL surface can't be created for additional windows.
 * emu/emucore.h: Added explicitly defaulted copy and move constructors for emu_fatalerror.
 * Fixed apparent misunderstanding of const.  Returning const value types and casting to const value types is pointless outside very
    narrow use cases.  Putting const value type parameters in interfaces just makes trouble.
 * cpu/adsp2100: Use count_leading_ones_32 where it's simple rather than inverting and counting leading zeroes.
 * util/multibyte.h: Don't pollute global namespace, constexpr implies inline, make narrowing casts explicit.
 * imagedev/simh_tape_image.h: inline is implied for member functions with bodies supplied at declaration.
 * Tidied up some ugly casts in various places.

 redump. Added notes about these bad dumps in the driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 * 2 of 3 sets of the driver are bad dumps....This starts to be annoying.

-Marked bformula2 as BAD_DUMP. Main and audio CPU ROMs bits 2 & 5 are stuck to 0. Seems to be a dirty programmer socket since both
 ROMS have the same failure. The device needs to be redumped. Added notes about these bad dumps in the driver. [Roberto Fresca]
 * 3 of 4 sets we checked to work on them are bad dumps....Time to check all the jordigahan dumps before add them.

 [Sergio Galiano, Recreativos Piscis, David Haywood, hammy] (#11584) [mamehaze]
 * replace MCU simulation in ddealer with emulated NMK-110 MCU [Sergio Galiano, Recreativos Piscis, David Haywood, hammy]
 * hooked up MCU for tdragon1 too
 * added the nmk-113 dump to hachamf and hachamfa, this appears to be a multipurpose MCU, as it has multiple program paths depending
    on a port.
 * one of the config options in the 113 MCU is for Thunder Dragon, even if we use the 110
 * 113 can also be used with Double Dealer in a specific config
 * flip ddealer.cpp to more permissive license, with agreement from copyright holders

load the 215 binary too, even if for emulation purposes it seems unimportant
