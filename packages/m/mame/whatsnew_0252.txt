-igs/pgm.cpp: Use logmacro.h for logging. (#10762) [cam900]

-misc/megaphx.cpp: Adde YoYo Spell (prototype of Little Robin). (#10763) [David Haywood]

New working clones
------------------
YoYo Spell (prototype) [Opernet,  Recreativas.org]

-andromed: Changed the ship and "ATTACK !" text colour & moved "ATTACK !" to the top of the screen, to match the video from a
 working board. Set the dip switch default so you don't receive free credits [smf]

-megaphx: remove ppi reset workaround, remove vector table ram copy workaround [hap]

-andromed: add coinage dipswitch [hap]

-Merge copies of text_update and plot_text_character in a2_video_device (#10766) [benrg]
 * a2_video_device::{text_update,plot_text_character} already had a template parameter to distinguish II/II+ from IIe/IIc. Extending
    it enables {text_update,plot_text_character}{_ultr,_jplus,GS} to be merged in as well.

-Remove a2_video_device::m_dhires_artifact_map (#10767) [benrg]
 * m_dhires_artifact_map was just a rotate-four-bits-by-2 lookup table. The code that used it was already doing four-bit rotations
    by arbitrary amounts, so it is slightly simplified by eliminating the table.

-macadb: added the Ins/Del keys and fixed some keypad keys.  [R. Belmont, Kelvin Sherlock]

-m68kfpu: add support for fmove.p (d16,An), Dn [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * fixes frequent floating point errors running HP-UX 8 on HP9000/370

-i8255: update interrupt state with acknowledge/strobe inputs [Patrick Mackinlay]

-upd765: unify data_irq and other_irq (#10765) [cracyc]

-distate: max_length() has no use for value() either [hap]

-Improved Apple II hires graphics color simulation (#10773) [benrg]
 * This algorithm decodes the scan line to 560 bits in the same way as the hardware (and MAME's monochrome modes) and uses a 7-bit
    sliding window on the decoded bits. The result is the same as before if all high bits are clear. If high bits are set, the
    output is shifted right by one pixel as it should be, and the unique artifact colors at the boundaries between bytes with
    opposite high bits are simulated. (For more about those colors see page 8-20 of Understanding the Apple II by Jim Sather.)
 * The monochrome modes are rewritten to use the same decoding logic, which incidentally fixes some bugs: the left pixel of a
    14-pixel group was not updated at 0-to-1 bit-7 transitions (leaving old pixels on the screen), the test against cliprect was
    incorrect, and m_dhires was ignored.

-pinball/by35.cpp: redumped sound ROM for suprbowl [inkochnito, PinMAME]

-Merge copies of Apple II screen_update function (#10777) [benrg]
 * Following the merge of text_update and plot_text_character (93500d7), this merges apple2_state::screen_update{,_jp,_ultr},
    apple2e_state::screen_update, and a2_video_device::screen_update_GS_8bit into a single function in a2_video_device.

-Apple II double lo-res: work around issue #10760 (#10761) [benrg]
 * This implements the same workaround for double lo-res that was already used for double hi-res: shift the whole image right by one
    pixel (losing the rightmost pixel) in monochrome mode so that the NTSC shader is happy. This doesn't affect color mode.

-ui: Give menus an opportunity to recompute metrics on window resize. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also reworked calculation of menu geometry in general, and limited width of left panel on system/software selection menus.
 * Fixes images in the right panel and icons on the system/software selection menus not being scaled correctly when the window is
    resized (MT08539 is an example of this).
 * Fixes bad font size selection at low resolutions when using bitmap fonts like uismall.bdf (GitHub #7105).
 * Fixes collapse/expand arrows on left/right panels of system/softwre selection menus getting bigger if the window is made
    narrower.

-tubep: remove some tag lookups [hap]

-abc1600: Connect BUS0X PRAC callback, and break into debugger on bus error. [Curt Coder]

-More UI cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * Got rid of more UI globals.
 * Cache more metrics in system/software selection menus.
 * Don't lose a BDF font specified on the command line when changing font size via the UI.

-macadb: much better SRQ semantics.  Checked with all supported MCU types. Fixes GitHub #10790. [R. Belmont]

-Better Apple II artifact color table (#10792) [benrg]
 * Replace the "old" (committed just a few days ago) artifact color lookup table, which was designed in a somewhat ad-hoc way for
    hires graphics only, with a table based on simpler rules that can be used in any Apple II (not GS) video mode, though at the
    moment it is still used only for hires. Move it upward in the file in anticipation of other uses.

-SPARC and sun4 fixes and boilerplate cleanup: (#10793) [Ryan Holtz]
 * cpu/sparc: Implemented STBAR opcode as a no-op.  Fixes illegal instruction error in Solaris 2.4 installer.
 * sun/sun4.cpp: Converted to logmacro.  Added FDC dor_w hookup, fixing Solaris 2.4 installer hang.
 * sun/sun4.cpp: Cleaned up duplicate handlers, split handlers, removed tags, use abbreviated integer types.

-Separate Apple II video config from system config (#10806) [benrg]

-osd: Better XInput and SDL game controller input enhancements: [Vas Crabb]
 * Added initial support for XInput controller subtypes, starting with driving, arcade and flight controllers.
 * Check XInput capabilities to ignore buttons and hats that aren't present.
 * Added preliminary SDL Game Controller joystick provider.  Reconnection and mixed Game Controller/Joystick devices are
    unsupported.
 * Show the input token for the highlighted control on input device menus.

-ui: Allow menus to set required space above and below menu when metrics change.  Fixes the initial bad layout on the system
 selecton menu, or bad layout after resizing windows. [Vas Crabb]

-osd: Improved SDL Game Controller joystick provider: [Vas Crabb]
 * Allow fallback to joystick API for devices without game controller mappings.
 * Detect controller reconnection.
 * Force Switch Pro Controller ZL/ZR to act like buttons.
 * Added button names for Google Stadia controller.
 * Also fixed dumb copy/paste error on my part in Windows clipboard code.

-osd: Added support for mapping files to sdlgame joystick provider and made it default with SDL. [Vas Crabb]
 * This changes behaviour, however I think it's a net positive:
   - Most games using Steam Input or SDL2 to read game controllers have this behaviour, so users have come to expect it.
   - This module is better at giving meaningful names to buttons on common controller, and assigning axes consistently.
   - Button/axis mapping files using a widely-used format are supported.
   - The old behaviour is still available with `-joystickprovider sdljoy` if anyone wants it.
     * The new option for controller mapping files is in the general OSD options rather than SDL options as it can be extended to
        DirectInput in the future.

Fruit Genie (Version 1-1-03) [Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

-gladiatr: patch mcu roms to fix coin issue [hap]

-Miscellaneous fixes and refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * ui/analogipt.cpp: Fixed bar graph display for fields with ranges that wrap through zero.
 * emu/inputdev.cpp: Separateed analog axis deadzone and switch threshold settings, reduced default deadzone, and fixed a potential
    division by zero if the deadzone and saturation settings are equal.
 * emu/ioport.cpp: Fixed behaviour of absolute analog fields where range passes through zero - it previously only worked for
    specific combinations of mask, minimum and default.  Removed a workaround from universal/getaway.cpp that is no longer
    necessary.
 * emu/input.cpp: Fixed unintuitive behaviour when an absolute field is assigned an OR combination of a relative control folled by
    an absolute control (e.g. Mouse X or Joy 1 LSX).  Also fixed reading axis input sequences where an axis code is followed by a
    switch code (these can only be produced by manually editing configuration files, not through MAME's UI), and fixed the returned
    type when multiple relative axes sum to zero.
 * osd/modules/input_dinput.cpp: Fixed hat switches being stuck in up position when input is suspended in the background
 * taito/taitoio_yoke.cpp: Give throttle control a distinct type, and don't auto-centre.
 * osd: Added option to select MIDI provider module (currently only PortMidi and the dummy module are available).  Also put various
    things in namespaces, and fixed builds including SDL sound module with native Windows OSD.
 * emu/validity.cpp: Added check to catch I/O port fields using UI input types.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Renamed inputs that were causing confusion.  "Bill" and "Track" were causing confusion for translators and
    hence likely causing confusion for many users, especially those who are not native English speakers.  "Track" as an abbreviation
    for "Trackball" was frequently being mistranslated, e.g. in the sense of a CD track selection button or even in the sense of a
    railway track.  There's no reason to abbreviate it.  "Bill" in the US English sense as a banknote is too ambiguous and was
    causing confusion for translators.  It's better to use the less ambiguous "Banknote".  Corrected Greek translations of
    "Trackball".
 * Don't run GitHub Actions on issue template changes.

New systems marked not working
------------------------------
Primus Expert mit Stimme [Team Europe]

-Various input and OSD refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * osd: Supply OSD object to modules on initialisation.  Encapsulated some event handling in the OSD objects rather than leaving it
    in free functions.  Put various stuff in namespaces.
 * osd/modules/input: Enabled dinput, xinput and winhybrid modules for Windows SDL builds, and enabled background input for dinput
    and xinput (and by extension winhybrid) modules.  Also fixed some COM and X11 resource leaks.
 * osd/modules/input/input_sdl.cpp: Flipped SDL mouse button order to match Windows, and exposed vertical and horizontal scroll as Z
    and rZ axes. Moved SDL UI event handling out of input devices into OSD object.
 * osd/modules/input_rawinput.cpp: Changed lightgun Z axis token so it's correctly identified as a relative axis (it maps to the
    scroll wheel equivalent).
 * osd: Added an option to choose the network provider module.  Mostly useful if you build with both TUN/TAP and pcap support
    included, or if you want to disable emulated networking completely.
 * emu/input.cpp: Use a better strategy for assembling input code names that uses fewer temporary strings and doesn't require use of
    the non-Unicode-aware space trimming function (fixes MT08552).
 * osd/modules/input_dinput.cpp: Improved polling logic.
 * osd: Made various parts of the input code less dependent on concrete emu objects, and reduced inappropriately passing around the
    machine object. Made input modules less dependent on OSD implementation.  Encapsulated some stuff and got rid of some vestigial
    newui and SDL1 support code. Cleaned up some interfaces.  Moved OSD options classes to their own files.
 * Prepare to remove main.h from emu.h - it's mostly used to get the application name, which the vast majority of emulated devices
    don't need to do.

-osd/modules/input: Fixed Linux build. [Vas Crabb]

-pinball/inder.cpp: Fix date in note about "Mundial 90". (#10851) [ClawGrip]

-Major D3D and BGFX code refactoring and bug fixes: (#10858) [Ryan Holtz]
 * render/bgfx: Improved clearing and blending. Added prescale support. Fixes MT07586, MT07587, MT08084.
 * render/bgfx: Fixed blend and tint handling. (Fixes Github #1953).
 * render/bgfx/blendreader.cpp: Support non-separated blend mode specification for BGFX effects.
 * render/bgfx: Reworked how horizontally-padded screen textures are handled. Likely fixes MT08512 and MT08505.
 * render/bgfx: Ensure that a texture's width margin is updated in all cases.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Fixed tinting in HLSL post-processing mode.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Avoid most redundant state-setting calls. Reduces D3D API calls by about 90% on fruit machine drivers.
 * render/d3d/d3dhlsl.cpp: Assign SourceDims and QuadDims uniforms to only those effects that use them.
 * machine/laserdsc.cpp: Always add video quad to screen container, adjust tint based on m_videoenable instead.

-spclforc, spcfrcii: Add sound device [AJR]

-z80dma: improved end of block test [Patrick Mackinlay]

-osd: Turned video modules into actual modules, fixed various issues. [Vas Crabb]
 * Don't ignore the return status of OSD module initialisation.  Attempt to fall back to an alternate module if the selected module
    fails to initialise.  Log more useful diagnostic information at verbose level.
 * Fixed BGFX crash on exit after toggling fullscreen.  Also persist more settings than just the selected chains across toggling
    fullscreen.
 * Turned video modules into OSD modules in the same sense as all the other OSD modules.  They now use the same selection/fallback
    mechanism as all the other modules without special extra code in the OSD implementations.
 * Untangled some object ownership mess.  Windows own renderers, OSD objects own windows.  Fixed a refrence loop that caused the
    first window object to always leak.
 * Don't create renderer object until after underlying window has been created.  Fixed issues with order of creation/destruction
    when toggling fullscreen or changing prescale in fullscreen with -switchres in SDL builds.
 * Use more smart pointers in BGFX and Direct3D render modules.  Most of the code now reutrns a smart pointer when handing over
    ownership or a naked pointer when retaining ownership.  Fixed a few leaks and simplified cleanup code.
 * Encapsulated various OSD modules better.

-mame/v*-z*: put drivers in anonymous namespaces where applicable, updated #ifndef guards to the current tree structure
 [Ivan Vangelista]

-bgfx: Refined configuration handling: [Vas Crabb]
 * Sort screen chains by none, default, then collation order (rather than whatever order the filesystem yields).
 * Correctly persist settings across fullscreen toggle when explicit screen chains are configured.
 * If chains are specified for a single window only, apply them to all windows.
 * Treat empty string for screen chain as "default" rather than crashing.
 * Changed default setting for bgfx_screen_chains to an empty string so chain selection will be saved/restored per system with
    mame.ini file created by -cc with no other settings.

New working clones
------------------
Tekken 3 (World, TET2/VER.C) [Guru, Heihachi_73]

-ap_dsk35.cpp: enable 1.44Mb dc42 images [Peter Ferrie]

-osd/render/draw13.cpp: Got rid of a simple_list. [Vas Crabb]

-osd/modules/render/draw13.cpp: Fixed leaked/double freed texture data. [Vas Crabb]
 * The texture malloc's its own storage if the copy info doesn't have the passthrough flag set - the test was reversed.

-bus/vme/vme_mvme327a.cpp: Fixed clang build (unused lambda capture). [Vas Crabb]

-mc88200.cpp: More clang fixes [AJR]

-fix Clang compile [nw]

-RTC interface updates [AJR]
 * dp8573, mc146818, mm58274c, rtc65271, s3520cf, smpc, timekpr: Use device_rtc_interface to acquire base time
 * device_rtc_interface: Add machine configuration option for synchronizing to UTC instead of local time (was previously only an
    option for mc146818, and always enabled for dp8573)
 * mc146818: Eliminate the set_binary_time configuration parameter
 * mm58274c: Correct operator precedence in calculating m_clk_set; allow disabling side effects of status read

-another Clang fix [nw]

-Miscellaneous fixup: [Vas Crabb]
 * video/i82730.cpp: Fixed misguided "fix" that broke category-based logging.
 * bus/macpds, bus/nubus: Eliminated use of simple_list.
 * konami/k053246_k053247_k055673.cpp: Moved assert to work around Konami GX games failing to start - the code is still dodgy.

-i386: don't change x87 stack pointer until after memory access in case of a page fault [cracyc]

-i386: nm fault if ts is set [cracyc]

-Small batch of input refactoring: [Vas Crabb]
 * emu/input.cpp: Fixed regression in display of some joystick inputs.
 * osd/interface: Split up interface classes into a few more files to reduce where the input device interface class needs to be
    included. Made OSD independent of concrete input_device class.
 * osd/modules/input, emu/inputdev.cpp, emu/ioport.cpp: Allow input devices to provide tokens for controls without standard item
    types and additional default input assignments.  Fixes issues assigning Yen and Backslash on Japanese keyboards.
 * ui/textbox.cpp: Added a fixed-content text box menu class for future use.
 * Got main.h out of emu.h as it’s only used in a very small number of places, mostly for getting the application name.  Added
    eminline.h to attotime.h as it's used without emu.h.  Cleaned up forward declarations in emufwd.h a little.

-cpu/arcompact: Cleanup: [Vas Crabb]
 * Moved common instruction field accessors used by the CPU core and disassembler to a shared base class and made them constexpr.
 * Got the inline member functions bodies file out of the public CPU header so they aren't pulled in by everything using it.
 * Got most of the disassembler handler declarations out of the public header so they can be changed withut excessive recompiling.

 * state that:
 * The IFR bit 7 is not a flag. Therefore, this bit is not directly cleared by writing a logic 1 into it. It can only be cleared by
    clearing all the flags in the register or by disabling all the active interrupts as discussed in the next section.
 * but this is what current code does. If more updated datasheets are available, please share the links.

 * osd/modules/input, emu/inpttype.cpp: Made most default joystick assignments supplied by input modules.  Input modules take
    available controls into consideration when generating default assignments.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Added a separate "Back" UI input separate from Cancel. You may want an easier to hit combination for moving to
    the previous menu than for exiting or cancelling input.  They both default to Escape.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Added a UI Help control.  Currently only used by analog inputs menu
 * emu/inpttype.h: Moved I/O port field type enum to its own header and sorted UI controls so they appear in a more logical order.

    multi-value items instead.
 * ui/inputmap.cpp: Don't use immediate cancel to cycle between clearing and restoring default assignment (use UI Clear instead).
 * osd: Reduced the number of files needing to include the dreaded emu.h. Got some implementation out of headers.
