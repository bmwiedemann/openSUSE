Chong Chong Le Yuan (V100CN) [little0]

-cpu/e132xs: Don't generate code to handle a delayed branch inline. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also avoid an redundant load when checking if trace is active.
 * Reduces generated native instruction count by about 24% on x86-64 and gives an overall performance improvement of about 3.5% in
    -bench scores.

-cpu/e132xs, cpu/drcbex64.cpp: More fixes and optimisation: [Vas Crabb]
 * cpu/e132xs: Implemented supervisor and trace modes as recompiler modes. This eliminates or simplifies a lot of run-time checks.
    In particular, the trace checks on every instruction are not generated when not tracing, and simplified to just checking the P
    bit when tracing.
 * cpu/e132xs: Optimised code generation for RET, avoid a redundant load when checking for an overflow trap, use the exception
    parameter for exception codes rather than generating one function for each possible code.  Also simplified interpreter code for
    RET.
 * cpu/e132xs: Implemented SUMS for the recompiler.
 * cpu/e132xs: Implemented privilege check for setting L (interrupt lockout) for recompiler.  Not implemented for interpreter.
 * cpu/e132xs: Partially fixed tracing.  P flag should be set by all instructions except RET.  Trace exceptions are not triggered
    for branches when using the recompiler.
 * cpu/e132xs: Fixed ILC being set incorrectly for RET.
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid unnecessary expensive operations when a shift operation request the zero and/or sign flags but not the
    carry flag.

Chao Ji Da Heng 2 (V311CN, alternate GFX ROMs) [little0]

-cpu/e132xs: Fixes and optimisations: [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixed XM (index move) instructions failing to update the destination register on range error for interpreter and recompiler.
 * Fixed double-word stores when the source indicates SR (both stored words are zero) for interpreter and recompiler.
 * Fixed recompiler failing to set ILC and P on range error and frame error exceptions.
 * Optimised recompiled code for word size shifts.
 * Pushed more recompiler logic from run-time to code generation time and simplified delay slot PC check and trace check logic.
 * Use MOV rather than LOAD where possible in recompiler to improve code generation performance and symbolic memory locatin names in
    disassembled UML.
 * Updated TODO list in header comment, reduced copy/paste some more.

-cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid some more unnecessary register copies for ROLAND. [Vas Crabb]

-machine/i82371sb.cpp: rectify https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/377e9d6d7dd2f04427b21387f14dc0e9b30970e3 [angelosa]

-cpu/e132xs: Moved interrupt check to the beginning of instruction execution. [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixes interrupts not being serviced while tracing.
 * Further improves recompiler performance.
 * Fixes recompiler interrupt check function calling itself recursively.
 * Also added debugger exception hook calls to interpreter and recompiler.

-i960: Further disassembly fixes [AJR]
 * Enable decoding of a few more reg-type instructions
 * Add 0x prefix to unary branch destinations

-cpu/e132xs: Call debugger exception hook for TRAP instructions. [Vas Crabb]
 * Also made cycle counts a bit more consistent between interpreter and recompiler for exceptions and traps.

-scsp: improve handling of MIDI interrupts (#13521) [Matthew Daniels]

-cpu/e132xs: Made debugging Hyperstone E1 software less painful. [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixed local register display in debugger (this never worked).
 * Made disassembler show local register indices.

-cpu/e132xs: Fixed some recompiler cycle counts: [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixed double-counting bug in exception dispatch.
 * Fixed unsigned comparison of signed values in MUL cycles calculation.

-winspike: remove outdated comment and MUP flag [hap]

-cpu/e132xs: More fixes and optimisation: [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixed failing to call the debugger instruction hook for the first instruction following an interrupt, exception or trap.
 * Use UML branches to emulate non-delayed intra-block branches, avoiding the expensive "hash jump".
 * Re-worked the instruction description code:
   - Calculate static branch targets for more instructions.
   - Flag instructions that may cause mode changes.
   - Don't be so eager to end an instruction sequence.
   - Removed the local register input/output flags - FP may no be the same when executing the code as when describing instructions.
 * Fixed interpreter incorrectly setting ILC when an interrupt immediately follows a RET instruction.
 * Fixed recompiler flag calculation regressions, and optimised a little.

-model2: wait state when writing to copro TGP input FIFO; also adjust TGP frequencies on Model 1/2 (#13543) [Matthew Daniels]
 * model2: wait state when writing to copro TGP FIFO
   - The Manx TT course select rotation bug was caused by the i960 running too far ahead of the TGP and overwriting 0x918000 before
      the TGP got a chance to read it; adding a wait state when writing to the input FIFO prevents this
   - Also increase clock speed of TGP to 16.666 MHz (50 MHz / 3)
 * model1: change TGP frequency to 13.333 MHz (40 MHz / 3)
 * model2: remove issue that no longer occurs since TGP rewrite

-mb86233: add /3 clock divider [hap]

-Konami (GX) blending - additive sprite blending, improved tile blending (#13473) [Fredrik Sandkvist]
 * k053246_k053247_k055673.cpp, k053246_k053247_k055673.h: I went back to update zdrawgfxzoom32GP(), now down to a third of its
    original size before I started changing it. As a thinly veiled excuse for reworking the whole function, I went ahead and added
    additive sprite blending (to the now singular alpha call site).
 * Remarks: the mix priority setting is not yet handled. It seems simple enough (flip dst and src), but I would like to find an
    example of this before I implement it.
 * k054156_k054157_k056832.cpp: The attr variable holds what appear to be the elusive tile (external) mix codes. Attach it to the
    flags variable so these bits can be accessed in the tile callback functions. Tiles with mix codes gets their own tilemap
    category.
 * Remarks: I've now changed the callback to include an attr param.
 * k054338.cpp: Update set_alpha_level. This function now returns a level, an additive blend bool and a mixpri bool. Minor style
    changes to the overall file.
 * Remarks: set_alpha_level doesn't actually set anything. Maybe rename to get_alpha_level?
 * moo.cpp, xexex.cpp: Mask out the new additive & mixpri bits from set_alpha_level calls for now, until it's known if / how they
    should be used over there.
 * mystwarr_v.cpp, mystwarr.h: Remove mystwarr water hack. Update mystwarr_tile_callback (and add viostorm_tile_callback) to read
    tile mix codes, store last read mix code in a new m_last_alpha_tile_mix_code variable. Attach m_last_alpha_tile_mix_code to
    mixerflags, which happens to have two unused bits.
 * Remarks: I updated the mixerflags documentation to mention the usage of the last two bits.
 * konamigx_v.cpp, konamigx.cpp, konamigx.h: Shrink GX_MAX_SPRITES, which to the best of my ability seems to be oversized. There
    does seem to be several oversized arrays / defs in these files, so I think this is one of them. The usual FredYeye updates to
    konamigx_mixer - move declarations closer to use, more suited types, rename temp vars, etc. Change objpool to a vector,
    simplifying usage (push_back, size). Replace sorting loop with reverse + stable_sort. Improve gx_draw_basic_tilemaps - read
    internal / external alpha mix codes based on vinmix_on. Tiles with mixcodes get drawn in a separate pass for per-tile blending.
    Update alpha_tile_callback and add salmndr2_tile_callback, same as the mystwarr_v callbacks.
 * What started out as trying to sort out konamigx_mixer() to look at shadow/priority issues instead ended up with me finally
    getting a foot into the figurative tile blending door. The mystwarr water hack is gone, and sexyparo gets transparent windows.
    This might affect many GX and related games. Alpha blending might be broken in some games now, and needs to get their mix codes
    attached in their respective callbacks. salmndr2 got tagged in my automatic video comparison for differing from earlier
    versions, that's why I managed to fix it already.
 * Known problems: metamrph: stained glass windows are near-transparent at the moment. I think additive tile blending will fix it...
    viostorm: character names fade in in reverse. This also uses additive blending, so this might also get fixed once that's in.
    fantjour: the top & bottom flames at the captain kebab ship go missing. Uses additive blending.

New NOT_WORKING machine
-----------------------
Oldsmobile Driver Information System (version 2.2 CH) [Devin Acker]

-cpu/e132xs: Miscellaneous fixes/optimisation: [Vas Crabb]
 * Fixed behaviour of delayed branches, trace exceptions, and saved PC calculation for error exceptions in delay slots for the
    interpreter. All instructions in delay slots, branching instructions that can raise exceptions and tracing shoud now (mis)behave
    properly for the interpreter, including things the manual says you shouldn't do.
 * Fixed and optimised flag updates for left shifts for the recompiler.
 * Optimised ROL instruction for the recompiler and made flag calculation equivalent to the interpreter both with and without the
    "Missioncraft flags" compile-time option.
 * Only block interrupts for one instruction following a delayed branch.
 * Optimised the SOFTWARE instruction a little for the recompiler.
 * Added more SDRAM configuration logging and cleaned up code a bit.

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Apply the change from 7efe37938f9dd6a366e to OR and XOR instructions as well, and fix some cases where a 32-bit
 logical operation would fail to clear the upper bits of a register. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid more conditional branches on conditional MOV. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Fixed build after previous commit. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbex86.cpp: Got rid of unnecessary std::function use.  This substantially reduces the code size and reduces allocations
 during code generation. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp, cpu/drcbex64.cpp, cpu/drcbex86.cpp: Got rid of the intermediate tables in favour of bit switch statements.
 This improves startup time, reduces code size, and gives the compiler more optimisation opportunities. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp, cpu/drcbex64.cpp, cpu/drcbex86.cpp: Got rid of asmjit namespace qualifiers left over from when the class
 declarations were in headers and hence outside the scope of the using namespace statements. [Vas Crabb]

 * Added post load handler for E1-XS and E1-XSR cores to install SDRAM mode/configuration handlers if necessary.
 * Improved comment about different Hynix and Hyperstone CPU models.
   - cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Don't update flags that aren't requested in a few places.

-cpu/e132xs: Fixed I/O for models with 16-bit external bus. [Vas Crabb]
 * Only a single I/O access is generated for an I/O word read/write.  The upper half just disappears if the pins aren't present.
    This fixes "phantom" I/O accesses, allowing address maps to be cleaned up a bit.
 * Reduced I/O address width for models with 16-bit external bus to match hardware.
 * Made addressing consistent between interpreter and recompiler for I/O double-word accesses.
 * Implemented power down via internal I/O write for E1-X and later cores (none of the games I tested actually use it).

-misc/pasha2.cpp: Enabled the recompiler for Zooty Drum - it gets just as far as the interpreter now. [Vas Crabb]

-act/victor9k.cpp: Get audio working on Victor 9000 (victor9k) (#13549) [donohoe00]
 * 6522via: Don't generate a signal on PB7 when the timer 1 latch is programmed with 0.
   - On the Victor 9000, the clock for the audio codec is generated by a via6522.  PB7 is connected to the codec's clock input.
      Non-speech sounds (e.g. beeps, musical notes) are produced by outputting a cyclical waveform from the codec, with the pitch
      determined by the frequency of the codec clock.
   - Software running on the Victor 9000 has been observed to attempt to silence the audio by writing 0 to the T1 timer latch (not
      by turning off continuous mode or PB7 output).  With the emulated via6522, this resulted in a high-frequency clock signal
      being output on PB7, causing a high-pitched squeal whenever notes are not being played.
   - From this observed behavior we could infer that the original 6522 HW does not output a signal on PB7 when the latch value is 0,
      and that the Victor 9000 software was relying on this behaviour to silence the audio output (one would have to assume that the
      real hardware didn't produce a squeal).
 * mc6852: fix various transmit-related issues which were preventing victor9k Audio output from working.
   - The expected behavior of mc6852 is to write the data received in the FIFO register serially via tx_data_callback().  However,
      this was not implemented, and the only way data in the transmit FIFO could be removed and transmitted was by calling
      get_tx_byte(), and to then serially transmit the data by some external mechanism.
   - Only m68sfdc.cpp calls get_tx_byte(), so it's hard to see how any other device using the mc6852 would have been able to
      transmit data.
   - Software running on victor9k attempting to play audio would hang, since it would block waiting for the TX FIFO to empty.  With
      these changes, Victor 9000 audio playback works as expected, with the data getting sent serially to the Audio codec.
   - In order to avoid breaking m68sfdc, a new API call is added to allow data to be sent the "old" way.  m68sfdc now calls
      set_tx_pull_mode(true), to get the previous behavior.  As I understand it, other devices using mc6852 must be broken, and
      would need to be revisited.

-sound/k007232.cpp: Suppress side effects for debugger reads and cleaned up code. (#13580) [cam900]
 * Use references rather than pointers where appropriate, made some variables const.
 * Made parameter names match in header and source and reformatted code.

-cpu/avr8/avr8.cpp: Fixed program address masks and boot ROM sizes. (#13578) [cam900]
 * Fixed program address masks for word addressing.
 * Fixed PC shift in state string export.
 * handheld/pensebem.cpp: Fixed internal ROM region size.
 * makerbot/replicator.cpp: Use lowercase hexadecimal literals.
 * skeleton/venteta.cpp: Fixed CPU type for fix PC size (16 bits - also word unit) and internal RAM size (4000 bytes).
 * ultimachine/rambo.cpp: Fixed internal ROM region size, use lowercase hexadecimal literals.

-machine/nscsi_bus.cpp: Changed data release delay to 400ns to match the comment. (#13593) [Adam Billyard]
 * It was previously using a value of 40ns.

-bfm/bfcobra.cpp: Corrected polarity of brainbox2 cashbox door sensor input. (#13595) [mamehaze]
 * Allows the game to accept credits.

-A couple of recompiler improvements involving the carry flag: [Vas Crabb]
 * cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Optimised setting up carry flag for ADDC and SUBB. There's no need to preserve the NZV flags so a
    two-instruction sequence can be used.
 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Simplified code generation for CARRY.  I have no idea why it was preserving RAX at all - it always uses RAX as
    a scratch register.

-noraut.cpp driver: Added the tpoker2 and tpoker2a bipolar PROM CRC32 to rom load. Added workaround to show cards in tpoker2a and
 tpoker2b attract for testing purposes. [Roberto Fresca]

-Norautp.cpp driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Turbo Poker II palette decoded from bipolar PROMs.
 * Adjusted the Poker Plus palette to 256 entries.
 * Dedicated Turbo Poker II memory map and machine config.

-nycaptor: fix priority bug on spot 22 [dink]

-misc/dgpix.cpp: Marked Elfin as having unemulated protection. [Vas Crabb]
 * Elfin will eventually get into a state where it ignores coins. Protection is conceptually similar to The X-Files.

-cpu/uml.cpp, cpu/drcuml.cpp: Made it possible to build with logging simplifications enabled (in uml.cpp it logs each step, in
 drcuml.cpp it logs the net change).  It will produce absoluely massive logs, though. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcuml.cpp: Removed woefully inadequate and badly rotted "backend validation" code. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Fixed more cases where ROLAND clobbered source registers. [Vas Crabb]
 * ROLAND could clobber source registers or produce incorrect results if the desination was the same UML register as the shift or
    mask.
 * Fixed a bug in the logic for deciding whether to use a temporary register for the mask for ROLINS.
 * Also optimised ROLAND and ROLINS some more (particularly translation from UML's left rotate to ARM's right rotate) and removed a
    special case that the simplifier now takes care of.

-nec/pc9801.cpp: fix SDIP bank interface for pc9801us and pc9801fs [angelosa]

-nec/pc98_sdip.cpp: drop template i/f [angelosa]

-casio/cps200.cpp: Added a skeleton Casio CPS-2000 driver; also improved µPD934 and MSM6200 emulation. (#13591) [Devin Acker]
 * machine/msm6200.cpp: Scan matrix on a timer until a change is detected.
 * sound/upd934g.cpp: Fixed play sample command.
 * casio/cz1.cpp: Added MSM6200 clock input frequency.

New systems marked not working
------------------------------
Casio CPS-2000 [BCM, Devin Acker]

-sound/gb.cpp: Fixed master volume control and cleaned up code: (#13483) [cam900]
 * Fixed master volume control.
 * Fixed output range.
 * Fixed sweep, wave RAM corruption and GBA read/write emulation.
 * Use integer bit fields for pulse duty cycle tables.
 * Reduced duplication made some variables const, improved member names.

-cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Always keep UML floating point registers in memory for SysV ABI. [Vas Crabb]
 * This was changed in 822c3b4232b0a66ce92bba7a24084678004af444 but it never worked for multiple reasons:
   - The comment mentions saving around CALLC, but there is no code to save and restore around CALLC, DEBUG and RECOVER, all of
      which can clobber callee-saved registers.
   - Numerous opcode handlers assume XMM0 and XMM1 can be used as scratch registers, but this change mapped them to UML F0 and F1.
      This resulted in F0 and F1 getting clobbered by many UML instructions.

-lib/osdlib_unix.cpp: Added code to detect attached debugger on Linux. [Vas Crabb]

New clones marked not working

Soccer Kings (alternate set 2) [Paul Swan]

-Work round a race condition in the Compaq i8042 rom. Fixes using ctmouse.exe (v2.1 beta4) in shutms11. [smf]

-Implemented specific SH3/SH4 chips & pass the required endian into the constructor, SH4 internal registers now work when using big
 endian. The debugger is now aware that the SH3/SH4 has an MMU. [smf]

-makefile: Detect Windows for 64-bit ARM and set PLATFORM accordingly. [Vas Crabb]

-MIPS disassembler refinements (mips1, mips3, psx, rsp) [AJR]
 * Change hexadecimal prefix from $ to 0x ($ means something else in MIPS assembler syntax) and omit for small numbers
 * mips1, mips3, psx: Use shorthand mnemonics bal, beqz(l), bnez(l), li, move, neg, negu, not where applicable
 * mips1, mips3, psx: Add delay slot to jr ra for stepping out
 * mips1, mips3: Remove invalid instructions from other MIPS cores and use .word syntax for invalid instructions
 * mips3: Fix field spacing for some instructions

-Added Windows 64-bit ARM build to GitHub Actions CI matrix. [Vas Crabb]

-Avoid the need to set MINGW32 or MINGW64 environment variables when using a standard MSYS environment on Windows. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/e132xs: Cleaned up disassembler a bit, disassemble most invalid instructions as D.HU. [Vas Crabb]

-bimg: There should be no need to force SSE2 for 64-bit builds. [Vas Crabb]

-toolchain.lua: correct typo, xmen: add todo note about weird mcfg issue [hap]

-3rdparty/bimg: Re-added hack to work around GitHub CI issues. [Vas Crabb]
 * Attempt to enable SSE features explicitly specified in ARCHOPTS.  It will still fall back to SSE 2 if you just use -march= to
    enable later SSE features.

-igs/goldstar.cpp driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]
 * New machine driver for Lucky Bar.
 * Added special NVRAM for Lucky Bar.
 * Simulated the Lucky Bar MCU.
 * Fixed animalhsb and animalhsc graphics.
 * Added workaround and various fixes.
 * Fixed Lucky Bar reels, backgroung, and mask colors.
 * Hooked the Lucky Bar MCU, and added a workaround about.
 * Added callbacks and handlers to the Lucky Bar MCU for future full support.
 * First step of cleanning up the driver.

-debugcmd: correct trace file append [hap]

-debugcmd: update prev commit: change out+app to in+out+ate [hap]

-Cleaned up build scripts and compiling documentation: [Vas Crabb]
 * Made it a bit easier to cross-compile for x86-64 or i686 on an AArch64 Windows system.
 * Choose the default native recompiler back-end based on predefined macros rather than requiring the build scripts to set it.
 * Don't require every target without a native recompiler to declare this.
 * Got rid of the code that was supposed to set -m32 or -m64 when building GENie (it didn't work - it tried to use ARCHITECTURE
    before setting it).
 * Avoid relying on the unreliable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment variable.
 * Got rid of stuff for versions of Xcode that are definitely no longer supported.
 * Got rid of workarounds for very old Linux distros.
 * Use newer makefile syntax for if/else/if structures, comment some else and endif statements for clarity.

-siena_fr: corrected ROM checksums. [Nigel Barnes]

-apple/macii.cpp: Fixed regression where NuBus was stealing the internal video's slot $E space and allow PDS cards to hijack the
 internal screen. [R. Belmont]
 * bus/nubus: Many updates. [R. Belmont]
   - All cards: modernized with short types, fewer boilerplate comments, general cleanups, and card memory map support.
   - Lapis ProColor: fixed "encrypted" 4 and 8 bit-per-pixel modes and added the NuBus and PDS/30 versions of the ProColor 8.  Also
      used the TLC34075/34076 DAC device.
   - m2video: use the CRTC registers of the TFB 1.0 chip and the Bt453 DAC device.
   - m2hires: use the CRTC registers of the TFB 2.2 chip, merge in the Apple Portrait Card, and add the Apple Workstation Card.  All
      3 of these were the same card with different ROMs, pixel clock crystals, and DAC models (Bt473 or Bt474).
   - Sigma Designs LaserView: Now uses the CRTC register values.
   - RasterOps ColorBoard/264 NuBus: Much better correctness on the NuBus version, including support for the 30 Hz NTSC mode
   - RasterOps ColorBoard/264 PDS: Near-total rewrite using the TMS34061 and Bt473 devices.
   - SuperMac Spectrum/8 Series III: Use Bt478 DAC device like the real card.
   - SuperMac Spectrum PDQ: Documented that the card uses 3 Bt458 DACs.  Not actually hooked up that way yet.
   - Moniterm MacViking: Documented that the CRTC is a TTL state machine, there are no registers.
   - Micron/XCEED MacroColor/30: Merged with Color 30HR which is 99% the same hardware, and added an "internal" version which takes
      over the SE/30's internal display and allows you to show grayscale on the original CRT.
   - Micron/XCEED Color HR30: All available video modes are supported now with the MonitorXCEED software.  Also added an "internal"
      version like the MacroColor/30, decoded the register encryption, and used the correct Bt473 and Bt478 devices.

 * megadriv.xml, msx2_flop.xml: Fixed trailing spaces in attributes.
 * act/victor9k.cpp, poly88/poly88.cpp: Marked things using the MC6852 as lacking save state support as the device doesn't save its
    state properly.
