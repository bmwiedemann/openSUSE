   - Extensive QA rundown, including research on missing features and undumped machines.
     * pc9801.cpp: Don't passthrough mouse irq frequency when cycle setting is setup too, fixes jastrike mouse input on options

 * Decoupled support for RPK (RomPacK cartridge images) from TI-99 code, enabling the logic to be leveraged by other drivers.

-ui: Made zoom controls a bit more intuitive. [Vas Crabb]
 * The UI controls are described as zoom in/out, but they had the opposite effect on the palette and tile viewers.  That has been
    changed to make them consistent with the tilemap viewer.
 * Made the default zoom key not act as a toggle.  People are familiar with the function of Ctrl+0/=/- in web browsers, so making
    them behave similarly in MAME should make it more approachable.  Also added the default zoom key to the relevant documentation
    page.
 * Implemented the default zoom key for the palette and tile viewers.
 * In the tilemap viewer, if the view is in default expand to fit mode, zoom in/out starting from the actual zoom ratio.  Once
    again, this behaves more like the zoom controls in a web browser displaying an image so it should be more intuitive.
 * Made more messages from the tilemap viewer localisable.

-util/zippath.cpp: Fixed MT08074. [Vas Crabb]
 * There were multiple issues at play here.  After #8443 was applied, is_root was simply never returning true on Windows, as
    OSD_WINDOWS isn't actually defined outside libosd and libocore.  This caused phantom parent items to appear in disk roots on
    Windows, but it meant that the check in zippath_resolve would always fail so the trailing backslash would be trimmed.  Fixing
    the macro test in is_root meant the trailing backslash from C:\ would no longer be trimmed, which caused the stat in
    zippath_resolve to fail.

-bigbord2.cpp: Hooked up floppy DRQ that had somehow got lost. [Vas Crabb]

-Reduced tag map lookups in several drivers and devices. [Vas Crabb]

-util/coretmpl.h: Removed an overload of bitswap that can be avoided using if constexpr. [Vas Crabb]

-Added doxygen comments to some classes, and fixed several doxygen warnings. [Vas Crabb]

-util, osd: Test for _WIN32 rather than WIN32. [Vas Crabb]
 * In C++17 mode, WIN32 is no longer a predefined macro, although various things in 3rdparty define it to maintain legacy support.
    We're better off moving forward anyway for when WIN32 disappears entirely.  (WIN32 is not a reserved name, while _WIN32 is,
    starting with an underscore follwed by an uppercase letter.)

 * Corrected size of this pointer displacement - fixes issues on big Endian targets.
 * Fixed function addresses for virtual member functions on targets that use function descriptors (e.g. PPC64).
 * Applied shift to this pointer displacement for targets that use the ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Fixed this pointer displacement not being applied for virtual member functions on targets using ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Fixed this pointer displacement being incorrectly applied to vptr on targets using ARM variant of the Itanium ABI.
 * Made less code conditionally compiled to make it easier to catch errors.

-merits.cpp: Correctly identified set as "Pub Time Darts II" (#8595) [ClawGrip]

-sharrier: Hook up MCU, remove simulation (#8552) [Dirk Best]
 * The MCU for the sharrier1 set is handcrafted and marked BAD_DUMP
 * There is a slight issue with the initial synchronisation, so there is a hack to ignore the problematic write

-util/delegate.h: Try to catch issues earlier, and some cleanup. [Vas Crabb]
 * Optimised generation of late bind helper functions.  The late bind helper function doesn't depend on the delegate signature -
    only on the late bind base class and function target class.  Having it inside the delegate base class means it needs to be
    instantiated for every combination of late bind base class, function target class and delegate signature.  In a typical driver
    file, there is only one late bind base class (delegate_late_bind), and there will be delegates with multiple signatures bound to
    function members of the same class (e.g. read and write handlers, possibly of different widths, bound to members of the driver
    state class).  By moving the late bind helper out of the delegate base class, the number of required instantiations can be
    reduced.  By moving the body out of the enclosing class declaration, the compiler can be encouraged to coalese instantiations
    across translation units.  While this won't give a further reduction in compile time, it should at least reduce the output
    binary size by reducing duplication for devices that frequently have handlers installed in memory maps.
 * Added an additional template parameter to delegates allowing the late bind base class to be changed if desired.
 * Moved the MSVC implementation "this" pointer optimisation out-of-line and added logging.  Also cleaned up the Itanium "this"
    pointer adjustment and code pointer resolution implementation to reduce duplication and conditional compilation.
 * Made binding_type_exception give a more meaningful what() message than "std::exception".
 * Added extensive validity tests for delegate functionality.  Pointers to member functions are tested, including multiple
    inheritance, virtual and non-virtual member functions, and checking for generational loss across copying/assigning delegates.
    This should properly exercise "this" pointer adjustment for the Itanium and MSVC implementations, and vtable lookup for the
    Itanium implementation.  So-called late binding functionality is tested, including exceptions on failure.  Functoids are tested,
    although given the encapsulation it's not possible to check that an apator isn't generated when it shouldn't be.

Donkey Kong 8 in 1 (JY-041) [anonymous]

-plsonic4.cpp: added inputs, dips as per test mode [Ivan Vangelista]

-wndrplnt: Decapped and dumped MCU [Alex, Brian A. Troha, TeamEurope]
 * Also remove simulation, clean ups

-cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Proof-of-concept for optimisation of calling out. [Vas Crabb]
 * Resolve address space virtual member function addresses on constrcution and call them directly.  Provides a small but measurable
    improvement to performance in drivers that use the recompiler and access the memory system a lot.
 * Also made MSVC delegates capable of walking past all the thunks MSVC puts in the way of actually calling a member function.  I'm
    not accounting for the "this" pointer being passed in RDX when the return value is an oversize scalar.  This is harmless because
    it won't see anything that looks like a virtual call thunk using RCX when RCX points to uninitialised space for the return
    value.  It just means virtual member function calls won't be bypassed if the return value is an oversize scalar, but that
    doesn't happen frequently anyway.

-util/delegate.h: Make comparison operators more technically correct. [Vas Crabb]
 * For Itanium ABI, two null member function pointers should compare equal even if the undefined bits differ.
 * For MSVC ABI, there's all sorts of complexity around what happens when you compare pointers to member functions for different
    inheritance types.
 * You'll still occasionally get weird results comparing pointers to members of different classes.

-util/delegate.cpp: Recognise a couple more MSVC thunks. [Vas Crabb]
 * The MSVC C++ ABI doesn't reserve the first vtable entry for classes without a virtual destructor, so the instruction to load the
    virtual member function address may not need an immediate displacement.
 * Also recognise virtual member function call thunks for AArch64.

New working clones
------------------
Conchess Plymate 5.5MHz [hap, Berger]

-util/delegate.cpp: PowerPC-64 Little Endian drops function descriptors. [Vas Crabb]
 * At some point I'll make a proper header ABI detection.  There's too much stuff to keep in the delegate sources, and it will be
    useful for other stuff like recompilers.

-util/delegate.h: Use "compatible" delegates for MinGW GCC i686. [Vas Crabb]
 * The Itanium delegate has questionable value on on MinGW i686 as it injects a conditional branch in the hot path for delegates
    anyway to deal with the different __thiscall convention.  It's somehow breaking and causing memory corruption in full builds,
    but I don't have the time to work out exactly which delegate type is the problematic one, especially not with a release coming
    soon.
 * This will probably cause 32-bit MinGW builds to become substantially larger.
