New working software list additions (apple2_flop_orig.xml)
----------------------------------------------------------
Swimware (Version 2.1) [4am, Firehawke]

New working software list additions (apple2_flop_clcracked.xml)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Negotation Edge (cleanly cracked) [4am, Firehawke]

-Cleaned up bitmap API. [Vas Crabb]
 * Made const-qualified pixel accessors (pix, pixt, raw_pixptr) return const-qualified references/pointers to pixesl, and added
    non-const versions.  This makes bitmap more like standard library containers where const protects the content as well as the
    dimensions.
 * Made the templated pixt accessor protected - having it public makes it too easy to inadvertently get a pointer to the wrong
    location.
 * Removed the pix(8|16|32|64) accessors from the specific bitmaps.  You could only use the "correct" one anyway, and having the
    "incorrect" ones available prevented explicit instantiations of the class template because the static assertions would fail.
    You can still see the pixel type in the bitmap class names, and you can't assign the result of &pix(y, x) to the wrong kind of
    pointer without a cast.
 * Added fill member functions to the specific bitmap template, and added a explicit instantiations.  This allows the bitmap size
    check to be skipped on most bitmap fills, although the clipping check is still there.  Also fixed a couple of places that were
    trying to fill an indexed 16-bit bitmap with rgb_t::black() exposed by this (replaced with zero to get the same net effect).
    The explicit template instantiations in the .cpp file mean the compiler can inline the function if necessary, but don't need to
    generate a local out-of-line body if it chooses not to.
 * Extended the size of the fill value parameter in the base bitmap class to 64 bits so it works correctly for 64-bit bitmaps.
 * Fixed places where IE15 and VGM visualiser weren't accounting for row bytes potentially being larger than width.
 * Fixed an off-by-one in an HP-DIO card where it was treating the Topcat cursor right edge as exclusive.
 * Updated everything to work with the API changes, reduced the scope of many variables, added more const, and replaced a few
    fill/copy loops with stuff from <algorithm>.

-FreeBSD fixes (#7295) [Emmanuel Vadot]
 * psixptty: Fix for FreeBSD
   - We need to check for __FreeBSD__ not __FreeBSD_kernel__
 * FreeBSD: Use gl includes from pkg-config
   - FreeBSD doesn't install the includes from 3rdparty software in a default location so use pkg-config to get the correct path.
 * FreeBSD: genieos is named simple bsd

-netlist: Fix astro blaster sonar sound [couriersud]
 * Also fix two singular matrices being created.

-picture_image_device::get_bitmap was returning a possibly-null reference [Kelvin Sherlock]
 * null references are not valid/undefined in C++ so compilers like to eliminate the null pointer check.
 * switched to returning a pointer instead.

-mac: fix crash regression on macqd700 [R. Belmont]

-mac128: possible fix for out-of-bounds ROM access [R. Belmont]

-bus/hp_dio/hp98544.cpp: Don't crash when cursor is outside screen area. [Vas Crabb]

-imagedev/picture.cpp: Get rid of indirection to the bitmap. [Vas Crabb]

-Complete sound modernization of remaining devices. Legacy callbacks and stream_sample_t removed. (#7297) [Aaron Giles]
 * a2mcms/coco_ssc/gus/cassette/floppy/8364_paula/laserdsc/s2636/spg2xx_audio/arcadia/channelf/cmi01a/cps3/dai_snd: Update to new

 * sound: Remove legacy stream support and stream_sample_t
 * * gomoku/wiping: Remove silly mixer tables in favor of math
 * micro3d: Remove tiny vectors in favor of fixed arrays
 * phoenix: Went back to std::unique_ptr array for LFSR

New working machines
--------------------
Gondomania (World) [Brian Troha, TeamEurope, The Dumping Union, Dirk Best]

-am9519: has no clock input [Patrick Mackinlay]

-m3002: expose irq callback [Patrick Mackinlay]

-Don't clear memory before constructing devices, with the exception of drivers for now. [Vas Crabb]
 * This substantially reduces the overhead of running -validate, -romident, etc. and brings us a little closer to not needing to
    disable lifetime dead store elimination optimisations.  There are likely to be some issues that weren't fixed while this was
    still on a branch, so everyone be alert.

-ns32000: templatize on data bus width [Patrick Mackinlay]

New machines marked as NOT_WORKING
----------------------------------
ETH Ceres-1 [Bitsavers]

-bus/bbc: remove remaining stream_sample_t [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed BQ4847 to always return 0 for its register 15; required for proper chip detection. [Michael Zapf]

-mess.lua: forgot to add ceres [Patrick Mackinlay]

-konamigv.cpp: Added option to use joystick/button inputs  for weddingr. [Vas Crabb]
 * Control panel type can be selected in service mode.  This allows playing with joystick/button inputs, and also allows the
    completely unused second and third button inputs to be tested in service mode.  It's still possible to navigate service mode and
    correct the control panel setting if the wrong type is selected.

-Fix clang build [-Werror,-Wunused-const-variable]

-f8: Adjust disassembly format to better match Fairchild listings [AJR]

-astrob: Fix slowdown. [couriersud]
 * Fix a connection error.
 * Fixed order of PARAM overwrite.

-netlist: Remove "extended validation mode" [couriersud]
 * No longer added value.

-netlist: implement stricter validation. [couriersud]
 * Devices like BJTs and FETs which are defined but not used will now cause an error.
 * An unused device will create an additional solver with a singular matrix.
   - This is adding unnecessary performance overhead.
   - It complicates debugging because the unused device will cause an arithmetic signal if used with --fperr (nltool).
 * Fixed all validation errors.

-Update arcade.lua [Roberto Fresca]
 * Fix the arcade build (MASH)

-New clones added... [Roberto Fresca]

TV MegaMax active power game system 30-in-1 (MegaMax GPD001SDG) [David Haywood]

-added files for the VT APU type, currently no extra functionality, but will be built upon [David Haywood]

-lc58: Add disassembler [O. Galibert]

-tms9995.cpp: initialized one variable which caused crashes in formula1.cpp. [Ivan Vangelista]

-video/apple2e.cpp: initialized variable which caused the drivers to start sometimes in color and sometimes in monochrome mode, now
 that the framework doesn't initialize everything by default [Ivan Vangelista]

Konami Collector's Series Arcade Advanced [David Haywood]

-pdp11.cpp, terak.cpp: Add CPU notes [AJR]

-Got rid of most of the remaining problematic uses of make_unique_clear. [Vas Crabb]

-sound/discrete.cpp: Use C++ std::vector and range-based for. [Vas Crabb]

-netlist: applied some clang tidy recommendations [couriersud]

-netlist: Rewrote frontier documentation. [couriersud]
 * Also includes a small optimization for FP signal code.

-netlist: Fix a net splitting issue with four term devices. [couriersud]
 * Under cirtum circumstances the splitter would create "ghost" solvers consisting of terminals already used in another and complete
    solver. This may impact all netlist which use opamps and thus is committed early in the cycle.
 * This commit adds functionality to instruct the splitter code to include terminals which will not create matrix elements into the
    parsing of net groups for solvers.

-netlist: Convert driver filenames to lower case. [couriersud]

-emu/machine.cpp: Get rid of remaining make_unique_clear on 'manager' objects. [Vas Crabb]

-cpu/pdp1: Initialise a couple of pointer members. [Vas Crabb]

-sound/discrete: Reserve space before taking addresses of new vector items. [Vas Crabb]
 * This code is still unsafe, 16 just happens to be enough for the systems in MAME.  (The old vector_t implicitly reserved space for
    16 items on construction.)

-sound/discrete.cpp: Fix more crashes, and modernise a little. [Vas Crabb]
 * Reserve some space in another vector that it takes addresses to members of (fixes lack of sound in dkong and dkongjr).
 * Removed dependence on auto_alloc and friends.  There's one more problematic make_unique_clear now, but there are several fewer
    auto_alloc family calls.

-sound/discrete: Get rid of vtables in factories. [Vas Crabb]
 * This speeds up compilation.

-pdp1.cpp: initialized some emu_timer s that were causing crashes [Ivan Vangelista]

-pdp1.cpp: initialized 3 more variables that were causing crashes while running in gdb [Ivan Vangelista]

-Fix zexall target compile [Miodrag Milanovic]

-mess.flt: added macquadra700.cpp [Robbbert]

-votrax: Adjust the final filter [O. Galibert]

-ac1: swapped around brackets and braces in natural keyboard. [Robbbert]

-x1: moved note to make it clear it applies to x1turbo only [Robbbert]

-ti99_8: fixed some grammar. [Robbbert]

-elekscmp: Fixed paste. [Robbbert]

-partner: fixed spacebar,@,^ natural keys [Robbbert]

-radio86: fixed ^ natural key [Robbbert]

-sdk86: fixed Paste; got rid of terminal, since the system is meant to interface with an intellec unit, and this requires floppy
 disks and drives. [Robbbert]

-Got rid of global_alloc/global_free. [Vas Crabb]
 * The global_alloc/global_free functions have outlived their usefulness. They don't allow consistently overriding the default
    memory allocation behaviour because they aren't used consistently, and we don't have standard library allocator wrappers for
    them that we'd need to use them consistently with all the standard library containers we're using.  If you need to change the
    default allocator behaviour, you can override the new/delete operators, and there are ways to get more fine-grained control that
    way.  We're already doing that to pre-fill memory in debug builds.
 * Code was already starting to depend on global_alloc/global_free wrapping new/delete.  For example some parts of the code
    (including the UI and Windows debugger) was putting the result of global_alloc in a std::unique_ptr wrappers without custom
    deleters, and the SPU sound device was assuming it could use global_free to release memory allocated with operator new.  There
    was also code misunderstanding the behaviour of global_alloc, for example the GROM port cartridge code was checking for nullptr
    when a failure will actually throw std::bad_alloc.
 * As well as substituting new/delete, I've made several things use smart pointers to reduce the chance of leaks, and fixed a couple
    of leaks, too.

-netlist: rename more files to lower case. [couriersud]

-netlist: Add parse optimization to pfunction. [couriersud]
 * "(1 + 2)*a" now during parse step will be rewritten to "3*a".

-netlist: more clang lint fixes. [couriersud]

-netlist: move core_terms to netlist_state. [couriersud]
 * These are used during creation and reset only. No need to maintain them on net_t level.

-netlist: simplify code. [couriersud]

-emu/render.cpp: Consider that screens can be hidden when choosing a default view. [Vas Crabb]

-Fix clang error: exception specification of explicitly defaulted move assignment operator does not match the calculated one [AJR]

-upd765: Explicitly emulate reset line [AJR]
 * hx5102: Add addressable latches

-split off the handhelds that seem to be based around gpl162xx technology into their own file from generalplus_gpl_unknown.cpp

-netlist: Revert changes intended to make the code work on OSX 10.10. [couriersud]
 * This is working on all contemporary compilers. If outdated compilers are to be used it is fine but a suitable compile path should
    be used.

-pmatrix_cr.h: More logical fix for the nothrow issue [AJR]

-ut88: fixed ^ natural key; ut88mini: added note [Robbbert]

-sound/namco: Eliminate auto_alloc [AJR]

-bagman.cpp: redumped & corrected color PROMs for the Stern Bagman sets. [Steven McLeod]
 * Fixes: MT #02508 "// according to MT #02508 Stern/Seeburg logos should have different colors." New color PROM produces title
    screens that match screenshots from PCBs. Updated Stern's Super Bagman and now the title also match screenshots from PCBs.
 * Redumped all ROMs and PROMs so we now have verified correct ROM / PROM labels.

 * emu/uiinput.cpp: Made the event type a scoped enum.

-special: removed anonymous timer. [Robbbert]

-spkrdev: Fix sample volume averaging [AJR]

-pc98_cd.xml:  This change fixes the mismatch for the only known case where CHD label ended in a "." (in this case "...") which is
 typically an extension separation.  CHD label entries in source are always ".CHD" as actual filenames and extensions are stripped
 off which is why the 'toshin2s' entry scanned internally and with most common external utilities as not needing the trailing period
 marks. [Scott Stone]

-pacman.cpp: promoted clubpacm and clubpacma to working (#7337) [Devin Acker]
 * Corrected inputs for clubpacm.
 * Added inputs and protection latch for clubpacma.
 * Restructured clubpacm I/O stuff a bit.

-Major update for HC55516 CVSD audio device and related filtering, as well as hooking it to drivers. (#7290) [Jonathan Gevaryahu]
 * Split hc55516 core into separate cores/subclasses for hc55516 and hc55532 (new 'digital' implementation based on decap/die
    tracing) as well as mc3417 and mc3418 (old existing 'analog' implementation left alone) and hooked the hc55516 and mc3417
    implementations to the appropriate hardware drivers. This should vastly improve CVSD sound quality in drivers that use the
    hc55516. [Lord Nightmare, Sean Riddle]
 * Made Exidy's mouse trap use a timer to clock the mc3417 and update the state readable by the z80 rather than relying on the
    mc3417 to accept a clock parameter and update the z80 state via a callback. The timer implementation ensures proper
    synchronization and prevents missed clock transitions from the z80 side causing noise in the CVSD audio. [Lord Nightmare]
 * Added a biquad-based 2nd order filter emulation for an audio stream (to go along with flt_rc 1st order filter emulation) and
    hooked it to Exidy's mouse trap (mc3417) and williams drivers (hc55516) following the original schematics. For hc55516 this is
    necessary as the original chip produces a very pronounced audible 16khz 'carrier' in its output audio even on the real chip, and
    these filters suppress this. This also happens to a lesser extent with the 8khz quieting waveform noise on both mc3417 and
    hc55516. [Lord Nightmare]
 * Made Williams System 11 and s11_bg relative sound mixing more accurate to the original audio flow on the PCB itself.
    [Lord Nightmare]
 * Switched Williams Joust 2 to use the s11_bg common sound device rather than its own implementation. [Lord Nightmare]

-emu3: Removed unneeded fdc reset. [Nigel Barnes]

-cfa3000bp: Corrected region tag of speech phrom. [Nigel Barnes]

-Cleanup of recently added uppercase hashes in source files [Scott Stone]

-apple2 updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Adjusted horizontal position for "vapor lock" reads to better match MAME video timing
 * Fixed most 8-bit A2 rendering to respect the cliprect
 * The French Touch "Crazy Cycles" mode-splitting demo now renders correctly
 * This also solves glitching in some Total Replay games like Gumball

-emu/natkeyboard.cpp: Allow keyboard devices to be enabled/disabled. [Vas Crabb]
 * This fixes the "typing on all keyboards at once" issue.  You can now enable and disable keyboard/keypad inputs per device in the
    Keyboard Mode menu.  Default is to enable the first device with keyboard inputs, and all device with keypad inputs but no
    keyboard inputs.  The settings are saved in the CFG file for the machine.
 * Typing in natural keyboard mode only ever types on one keyboard at a time, but now you can control which keyboard it types on, as
    it will be the first enabled keyboard.
 * You can easily try this out with something like: mame64d zorba -rs232 terminal cpm

-ui/inputmap.cpp: Show device descriptions as well as tag paths. [Vas Crabb]

-mac128.cpp: Fixed mouse axis wrap compensation, cleaned up mouse code, eliminated static variables for mouse input state.
 [Vas Crabb]
 * You could see the issue with wrap detection easily enough just by running mac128k/mac512k/macplus and tapping the arrow keys to
    move the mouse one pixel at a time.  As you moved past the point where the axis count wrapped, it would move one pixel in the
    opposite direction.
 * There were two function static variables related to mouse input state, probably still lurking from when the code was initially
    made to use a driver state class.  This obviously messes with save states and prevents multiple instances.

-bus/a2bus/mouse.cpp: Fixed mouse axis wrap compensation. [Vas Crabb]
 * This device had the same bug with wrap compensation as mac128k.cpp.

-kaypro: merged software lists, using compatibility flag instead. [Robbbert]

 * Fixed //c and //c Plus mouse wrap issue found by Vas Crabb

-apple2 updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Ignore keys that come in immediately on startup (fixes some programs not showing intro screens)
 * Fix Apple IIc and IIc Plus having Video 7 RGB modes, which isn't possible on hardware

-Implement TT5665 emulation (#6841) [cam900]
 * Implement TT5665 emulation Similar as OKIM6295, but with Support more ROM capacity and phrase spaces, 2 sound outputs used in
    bowltry, igs_m036 (for some hardwares with TT5665, ex: cjddzsp) bowltry.cpp: Fix game name (BOWLING TRY! in both poster and PCB)
 * bowltry.cpp: Typo
 * Fix endline
 * tt5665.cpp: Reduce unnecessary argument

-dfs500.cpp: Const-incorrectness fixed [AJR]
 * photoplysx.cpp: srcclean

-Some nwk-tr changes (#7203) [Hydreigon]
 * Updated documentation as well as added some code from hornet.cpp's driver to correct the the whole "dual screen" situation.
 * Added the second K001604. Since nwk-tr does use two CG boards, there should be a second K001604 as well. Also had to add
    additional read/write parameters to support using two K001604s for now.
 * Updated network board documentation to better explain the chip at 2G, XICOR X76F041, and functions. Added NO_DUMP placeholders to
    the games that use this specific network board with the added eeprom.
 * Renamed 'Thrill Drive (EAA) (thrilldae)' to 'Thrill Drive (EAB) (thrilldbe)' because the program rom used for this set uses the
    'B' version. Also removed the "BAD_DUMP" flag from the timekeeper because the network board and timekeeper region data do not
    match. I would add a parameter for thrilldbe to change the network region data to "EA" but I don't know if it's even worth
    changing the simulation (imo better to hook the correct device like with ksys573).
 * Demoted thrilld and thrilldb to NOT_WORKING. The two never really worked to begin with and have gotten worse in later versions
    (freezes and crashes more often). I did test versions of mame with and without my edits and both act the same.
 * Added voodoo and screen parameter changes by @cam900 from hornet.cpp. So far so good for this driver too.
 * Added additional CG board roms for racingj and racingj2/j. According to racingj2's kit manual, it prompts the operator to change
    roms from the master and slave CG boards thus giving proof of the two using extra CG board roms. thrilld's kit manual doesn't
    prompt the operator to replace the slave CG board roms.
 * Made some attempts to fix the handbrake with no avail. Adding another pedal input port may have to be necessary.

-nwk-tr.cpp: fixed validation crash [Ivan Vangelista]

-gradius3.cpp: fixed MT07769 [Ivan Vangelista]

-m68000: Separate FPU code from header [AJR]

-Revet #7346. [Vas Crabb]
 * The project won't move forward if we're not proactive about ensuring legacy code isn't added.  In particular, this PR contained
    the kind of code that we need to remove in order to be able to move to proper per-device outputs and to allow clients to
    enumerate a system's outputs on start; and runtime tagmap lookups for I/O ports, which can't be checked on validation and hence
    require exercising all code paths to detect errors (as well as the performance issues).
 * The pull request had outstanding reviews requesting changes.  It's not acceptable to ignore that and merge it.
 * This reverts changes from e3dbb0fa43b78cf01e1f74b6dcc6fc8a7f4fc474 and fc8330e65cb0713a1931b7b3d771c37d5ffd020b.

-msm5232: fix: behaviour when the 'arm' flag set while envelope generator is on a decay state [eito]
 * msm5232, a tone generator chip which is used by some early TAITO and Alpha Denshi arcade PCBs, has 'arm' flag that alters
    behavoiur of envelope generation.
 * Basically, the 'arm' flag turns Attack-Decay-Release envelope generation to simpler ON/OFF states. If the 'arm' flag set, the
    transition from Attack to Decay doesn't occur unless explicitly indicated.
 * On current implement, when this 'arm' flag is set on a channel which is on a Decay state, the Decay state continues. It seems
    that, the state should be turned into a Attack state in this situation.
