Source changes
--------------
-z1013: Correct XTAL value and screen parameters based on schematics; make system clock configurable [AJR]

-ladybug: move zerohour stars to its own file (redclash driver now doesn't weirdly include ladybug_v anymore) [hap]

-redclash: let's rename driver to zerohour [hap]

-OSD/network interface cleanup [AJR]
 * Move osd_midi_device from osdcore.h to osdepend.h
 * Move osd_list_network_adapters from osdcore.h to osdnet.h (was already defineduniquely in osdnet.cpp)
 * Move #include <cstdarg> from osdcore.h to emu.h
 * Remove dinetwork.h from emu.h

-Debugger changes [AJR]
 * Added exception points as a new class of "points" triggering on specific exception numbers, with a similar set of commands to
    breakpoints and registerpoints.
 * Removed the per-instruction callback hook from device_debug. Only one driver was using this (rmnimbus.cpp), and what it was doing
    with it could be done more cleanly with exception points.
 * Change the type of the action string parameter for "points"-creating methods and make some parameters optional for those.
 * Change trace file logging to use a std::ostream instead of FILE * to take better advantage of strformat.

-Revert "gen_latch: add boost interleave conf setting" [Vas Crabb]
 * Jamming magic behaviour for a few systems into a common device just makes code more convoluted and harder to maintain.  The
    trouble with these things is that you quickly end up stuck with them, and then untangling the dependency on magical behaviour
    that never belonged in the device in the first place becomes an inordinate amount of work.
 * In this case, it isn't even saving a substantial amount of code in the drivers.
 * This reverts commit 229ea4b3a1b44bd558e2c99c31dfe3ad66c34ea0.

-Add file inadvertently omitted from 67be13960b2fffa5460c3e5dbb0a7f9736b87d3e [AJR]

-Patched up some gaps in functionality and fixed some bugs. [Vas Crabb]
 * ui: Added some missing functionality:
   - Added an option to copy input device IDs to the relevant menus.
   - Added an item for setting the software lists files path (-hashpath) to the folder setup menu.
   - Allow pasting text from clipboard in most places that allow typing (searching, entering filenames, entering barcodes).
   - Changed the software selection menu heading to be a bit less misleading.
   - Made barcode menu less eager to rebuild itself unnecessarily, and removed some confusing and apparently pointless code.
     * Exposed more Lua bindings:
   - Added low-level palette objects.
   - Added indexed bitmap types.
   - Added a bitmap method for extracting pixels from a rectangular area as a packed binary string.
   - Changed screen device pixels method to return width and height in addition to the pixels.
     * osd: Added some functionality and cleaned up a little:
   - Added a function for copying text to the clipboard.
   - Moved function for converting Windows error codes to standard error conditions to winutil.cpp so it can be used from more
      places.
   - Removed duplicate declaration of osd_get_clipboard_text and made the function noexcept (including fixing implementations).
   - Made macOS implementation of osd_get_clipboard_text skip the encoding conversion if it finds UTF-8 text first.
   - Changed the default -uimodekey setting so it doesn't lose the "not shift" that stops the default from interfering with UI
      paste.
     * Various bug fixes:
   - util/unicode.cpp: Fixed the version of utf8_from_uchar that returns std::string blowing up on invalid codepoints.
   - util/bitmap.h: Fixed wrapping constructors for indexed bitmaps taking the wrong parameter type (nothing was using them before).
   - util/bitmap.cpp: Fixed potential use-after-free issues with bitmap palettes.
   - emu/input.cpp, emu/inputdev.cpp: Log 1-based device numbers, matching what's shown in the internal UI and used in tokens in CFG
      files.
   - emu/emumem.cpp: Added the bank tag to a fatal error message where it was missing.
     * docs: Reworked and expanded documentation on configuring stable controller IDs.
     * For translators, the changes are quite minor:
   - There's a menu item for copying a device ID to the clipboard, and associated success/failure messages.
   - There's the menu item for setting the software list file search path.
   - One of the lines in the software selection menu heading has changes as it could be interpreted as implying it showed a software
      list name.

-sound/nes_apu.cpp: Added earliest hardware variant of 2A03 APU. (#10299) [0kmg]
 * Fixes several audio bugs with the noise channel in VS. System games, including:
   - High-pitch sound in vsgshoe percussion track.
   - Jet sounds in bnglngby.
   - Number of tanks killed count screen in btlecity.
   - nvs_platoon's bullet and enemies dying sounds are subtly changed.
     * It's estimated that these letterless CPU versions are in the first two million or so Famicoms (about 10% of Famicoms sold).
        There are games developed on the RP2A03 that have sound glitches on later, more common Famicoms.  For instance, the very
        last note in the game over melody in Balloon Fight rings out with a loud buzz on later machines.  The new famicomo driver
        plays it as the developers must have intended.

-Reimplemented Game Boy and Mega Duck cartridge slots: [Vas Crabb]
 * Allow cartridges to install themselves rather than putting accesses through trampolines.  Use memory banks even when they aren't
    installed directly, as it exposes script bindings and declares intent.
 * Added support for MBC6 Flash, and MBC7 two-axis accelerometer and 128*16 or 256*16 serial EEPROM.  Added basic support for Game
    Boy Camera image capture (various M64282FP processing features are not implemented). Improved MBC3 real-time clock emulation.
 * Added basic support for Hudson Soft HuC-1 cartridges (infrared I/O not supported) and HuC-3 cartridges (real-time clock and
    infrared I/O not supported).
 * Added full support for Vast Fame VF001 cartridges.
 * Separated Mega Duck flat and banked ROM cartridge types, and allowed software list items to specify whether a cartridge has fixed
    and selectable 16K banks or a single selectable 32K bank.
 * Added support for RAM sizes smaller than 8K that will be mirrored in the 0xA000-0xBFFF area.  Implemented correct ROM mapping for
    sizes that are not powers of two.  Corrected size of MBC2 internal static RAM.
 * Added support for various hypothetical cartridge wirings, such as MBC5 with outer ROM banking for up to 128M, M161 and Wisdom
    Tree cartridges with flat RAM, and MBC1 or MBC5 with fewer than the maximum number of inner ROM bank lines used.
 * Fixed logo spoofing logic for many pirate cartridges, including Rocket Games, Sachen MMC1 and MMC2, Sintax, Li Cheng, and
    Niutoude.  Identified fine bank mask register for GBCK003 board.
 * Added basic support for GBX format ROM images.  Added heuristic for detecting raw dumps of M161 cartridge images.  Removed
    unreliable unlicensed cartridge detection heuristics - these need to be reimplemented in a better way.

 * Reset the system from a timer callback for the Vast Fame/SL/J.Y. Company multi-game cartridges.  This fixes games on gbcolor.
 * Reset system when leaving configuration mode for GBCK003.  Fixes most issues with games.
 * Moved GBCK003 to its own source file, and added notes for both multi-game cartridge types.

-bus/gameboy: Improved GBCHK003 notes. [Vas Crabb]

-Changed fs::manager_t::enumerate_f() to simplify logic within file system drivers (#10106) [npwoods]
 * Changed fs::manager_t::enumerate_f() to simplify logic within file system drivers
   - enumerate_f() used to contain quite a bit of boilerplate logic to determine whether a particular floppy type should be added.
      This change attempts to move this logic outside the file system drivers to simplify the drivers.
   - The riskiest part of this change is unformatted_image::enumerate_f().  I attempted to replicate the logic that was previously
      determining with unformatted image types to use, but the logic is tricky and it isn't clear to me that replicating the logic
      is the correct action - I may be cargo culting.
 * Fix to floppy_image_device::fs_enum::add_raw()
 * Updating FS_FAT to reflect this PR
 * On the advise of Sarayan, I moved the filtering to the fs::manager_t::fs_enum base class.  This is actually a less intrusive
    change than what I originally had because it keeps the unformatted raw image handling closer to what we had previously.
   - Some misgivings about these changes: 1. We now have fs::manager_t::fs_enum::add() being a thin call that invokes a protected
      method called fs::manager_t::fs_enum::add_format().  Better ideas for names are welcome. 2. It feels odd that we've removed
      the need to do filtering from the various FS modules, but the unformatted module has to ask the fs_enum() for its internal
      variables for filtering to perform the same logic.  This seems to be the least worst option
   - Feedback is welcome

-ave_arb: workaround for emumem bug [hap]

-Debugger updates: [Vas Crabb]
 * Made closing the Qt debugger console window hide all debugger windows and run the emulated machine (debugger windows will be
    shown on next user break or breakpoint hit).  This matches the behaviour of the Win32 and Cocoa debuggers.
 * Made Qt debugger clean up its windows on exit rather than on subsequent starts.  This fixes GitHub #9789.
 * Made Qt debugger less reliant on global variables, and made code to save and load configuration a bit less convoluted.  It still
    needs more refactoring on this front, but it's in slightly better shape now.
 * Made Qt debugger a bit less crashy on invalid configuration.  Still plenty of ways to crash it, but every little bit counts.
 * Made Qt debugger do less comparisons on menu item names and object names - it might be possible to localise one day.
 * Moved all the C++ debugger implementations into namespaces.  They're using awfully generic class names, so it's about time.
