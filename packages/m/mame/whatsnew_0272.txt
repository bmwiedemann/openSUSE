Source changes
--------------
-scripts/3rdparty.lua: Enabled -Wno-tautological-compare for BGFX in order to evaluate turning it off for MAME. [R. Belmont]
 * cpu/es5510: Removed hack that never could possibly have worked, comparing a uint8_t to a 24-bit constant. [R. Belmont]

-midway/midvunit.h: Fix range error in "Galil" wheel controller emulation. [R. Belmont]

-stfight_dev: correct a comparison of an uint16_t with -1 [hap]

-cpu/m68000: Stub out the Coprocesor Interface Registers found on '010-'030 so that Mac ROMs can detect if an FPU is present.
 [R. Belmont]

-hash/pc98.xml: demote yumeijin [angelosa]

-cpu/upd7810/upd7810.cpp: Improve uPD7801 Mode C handling. (#12914) [wilbertpol]
 * Fixes banking in SCV Star Speeder.

-heathzenith/h89.cpp: Add initial support for the H-89 (and H-88 and Z-90) slot bus [arbee]
 * Uses the real I/O decoding PROMs
 * Z-37 and MMS 77316 floppy controllers converted to cards
 * H-88-3 serial and H-88-5 cassette interfaces converted to cards
 * Sigmasoft Sound card converted to a card

-kaneko/hvyunit.cpp: confirmed tiles ROM dump for hvyunitja [Brian Troha, Sean Riddle]

-metro/metro.cpp: verified some clocks for puzzlet [Guru]

-Thomson floppy disk updates [AJR]
 * to8, to9 & to9p now include the FDC in the base configuration. to9 uses a WD1770 (WD2793 appears to fail calibration), while to8
    & to9p use the THM-FC-1 gate array (now a separate device). This eliminates the need to, and ability to, configure floppy disk
    extensions for the to8, to9 and to9p.
 * Changed sector offsets for double-sided .fd images so that they load correctly (usually).

-emu/input.cpp: Guard against automatic integer promotion on arithmetic. [Vas Crabb]

-namcos23: remove texture_enabled flag, it caused missing graphics so this bit must have a different meaning, reset poly counts each
 frame to prevent trailing graphics and MAME crashing when holding INS [hap]

-machine/smioc.cpp: Cleaned up parameter bounds checking that could cause a compiler diagnostic. [R. Belmont]

-thomson.cpp: Overhaul all ROM definitions to correspond to actual ICs rather than logical banks. The sizes and hence hashes of
 virtually all files have changed due to being combined or split up. NO_DUMP entries have also been added for some known undumped
 PROMs. [AJR]

-Fixed dip switch hookup, added unpopulated buttons and updated IO port documentation on the Namco TSSIO JVS I/O board, based on
 hardware analysis by Guru. [smf-]

-apple/pseudovia.cpp: Split out the pseudo-VIA device used by RBV, V8, VASP, and Sonora. [R. Belmont]
 * This device was previously copy-pasted almost verbatim between those 4 devices, and it will be appearing in PowerBooks in the
    future as well.
   - apple/mac*.cpp: All 68020 and 68030 Macintoshes that didn't come with an FPU but were able to be fitted with one later now gate
      it behind a configuration switch. [R. Belmont]
 * You must completely exit out of the driver to for changes take effect.  This may be relaxed in the future.

-Fixed several things using memset on non-trivial objects. [Vas Crabb]
 * In particular, this fixes a delegate getting nuked in cpu/powerpc.

-apple/macpwrbk030.cpp: Major updates [R. Belmont]
 * Major modernization pass to bring in line with other Mac drivers
 * Pseudo VIA hooked up for VIA 2
 * Displays properly emulated for all models
 * Added 165 and 165c support
 * Power management MCU hookup greatly improved
 * Fixed ADB, audio, and SCSI issues
 * All models set the correct Gestalt ID

    OSCR, plus desoldering a chip and dumping it, I get the hashes I'm updating it to here. While I don't think Mame should consider
    it bad because No-intro does or vice-versa, I'm the dumper and glad to answer any questions to both projects.

-cclimber: merge driver [hap]

-cclimber,docastle: shorthand variable types [hap]

-3rdparty/sol2: Fixed build with clang 19. [Vas Crabb]
 * sol::optional<T&>::emplace was broken, and depended on the compiler not checking that members exist if the template wasn't
    instantiated.  See ThePHD/sol2#1606 and ThePHD/sol2#1648.

-lgtz80.cpp: Identify CPU as KL5C80A12; hook up input ports and interrupt [AJR]

Night Mare (Spain, set 2) [David Tallboom, Recreativas.org]

-mame.lst: Add 'nightmarea' [ClawGrip]

-debugger/osx: Don't use uninitialised NSRect when creating pop-up button. [Vas Crabb]
 * The initial size doesn't really matter because the pop-up button is resized before being added to the container that holds it and
    the expression field.  The disassembly viewer apparently wasn't updated properly like the memory viewer when the auto-sizing
    code was refactored.
 * Hopefully this will fix the debugger crashing when restoring window positions from configuration (although I would have thought
    this would cause crashes in more situations if it was the cause of that).
