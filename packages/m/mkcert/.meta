  <description>
mkcert is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates.
It requires no configuration.

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for development can
be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like example.test, localhost or
127.0.0.1), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing your own
CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized
knowledge and manual steps.

mkcert automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store,
and generates locally-trusted certificates. mkcert does not automatically
configure servers to use the certificates, though, that's up to you.

Warning: the rootCA-key.pem file that mkcert automatically generates gives
complete power to intercept secure requests from your machine. Do not share it.
