%description -n libmpir-devel
MPIR is an open source multiprecision integer library derived from version
4.2.1 of the GMP.

MPIR is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers. It has a rich set of
functions, and the functions have a regular interface.

This subpackage contains libraries and header files for developing
applications that want to make use of libmpir.
