  <title>Puzzle game where you steer a beam of light using mirrors</title>
  <description>This is a nice little game with color graphics and sound for your
Unix system with color X11. You need an 8-bit color display or better.
It will not work on black&amp;white systems, and maybe not on gray scale
systems.

It was first released as &quot;Mindbender&quot; in the year 1989 on the Amiga
(with ports on other computer systems) and is in fact a clone of the
C64 game &quot;Deflektor&quot;.</description>
