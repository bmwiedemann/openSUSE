Sun Jan 28 16:39:53 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to version 3.3.1:
  * improved error handling: display error message on screen (not
    only in the error file or on the console), and display path
    of the error file
  * fixed problem with R'n'D restarting with same level set that
    may have caused a problem (and therefore failing again and
    again); after an error, the last level set is now deactivated
    in file "levelsetup.conf" to restart with default level set
    (which should work without error)
  * added scripts directory to distribution package to enable
    building element definitions after editing artwork config
    source code files
  * added volume controls for sounds, loops and music to sound
    setup
