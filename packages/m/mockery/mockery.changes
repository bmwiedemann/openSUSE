- Packaging improvements:
  * Re-enable binary stripping and debuginfo boo#1210938
  * Use BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.22 rather than pin go1.22.
    The golang(API) expression allows use of newer go versions and
    integrates with the go metapackage via OBS prjconf Prefer:
  * Drop autosetup -p 1 arg only needed when package has patches
  * Use name macro where applicable to normalize common lines
    across Go app packages. Also makes renaming binary easier when
    required to handle package name conflict.
  * Build PIE with pattern that may become recommended procedure:
    %%ifnarch ppc64 GOFLAGS="-buildmode=pie" %%endif go build
    A go toolchain buildmode default config would be preferable
    but none exist at this time.
  * Drop mod=vendor, go1.14+ will detect vendor dir and auto-enable
  * Drop go build -o arg, default binary name is package of main()
