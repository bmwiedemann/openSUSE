  <title>Mono Debugger</title>
  <description>A debugger is an important tool for development. The Mono Debugger
(MDB) can debug both managed and unmanaged applications.  It provides a
reusable library that can be used to add debugger functionality to
different front-ends. The debugger package includes a console debugger
named &quot;mdb&quot;, and MonoDevelop (http://www.monodevelop.com) provides a
GUI interface to the debugger.</description>
