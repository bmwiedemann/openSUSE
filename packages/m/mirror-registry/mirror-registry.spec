%description
mirror-registry will analyse a remote registry and create a yaml file with all containers and tags matching a regex to sync with skopeo to a private registry. While this tool understands the architecture flag for containers, skopeo does not really use this information yet. If a repository contains multi-arch containers, it will fail if there is no container for the architecture it is running on, else it will use the architecture which it is running on.
