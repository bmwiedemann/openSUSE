  <title>Network emulator for rapid prototyping of Software Defined Networks (SDN)</title>
  <description>Mininet emulates a complete network of hosts, links, and switches on a single
machine. Mininet is useful for interactive development, testing, and demos, especially
those using OpenFlow and SDN. OpenFlow-based network controllers prototyped in
Mininet can usually be transferred to hardware with minimal changes for full
line-rate execution.</description>
