- Update to version 2.7
  * New user interface, inspired by mtr. Easier to track multiple
    streams and spot gaps in real-time.
  * Adjust ulimit so we can open enough sockets to send/receive
    multicast.
  * Support for adjusting payload length, 42 -> 1648.
  * Support for adjusting packet send/poll rate.
  * Support for using old UI using -o flag.
  * Support any source port in (S,G) joins.
  * Greatly improved IPv6 support, portability and multiple groups.
  * Dropped -r SEC option, not needed anymore and was misleading.
  * Fix #8: Handle IPv6 being disabled, per group and per socket.
  * Fix #9: No feedback on receiver when using mcjoin as sender.
  * Fix #10: Calculate and show gaps in received groups.

Wed Feb 26 11:56:58 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.5
  * Replaced mutually exclusive options -q and -d with -l level.
    Default log level is notice, for true quiet mode, use -l none
  * Added new daemon mode, which makes mcjoin detach from its
    controlling terminal and run in the background, with all
    output except progress redirected to syslog
  * Fix possible file descriptor leak
  * Improve error detection if mcjoin cannot find a default
    interface, a valid (source) IP address, or anything else
    goes wrong
  * Add support for -w SEC, initial delay before actually
    starting. Useful if started very early in a system bootstrap
    before network has come up properly
- Update to version 2.4
  * Support for SSM (S,G) join, in addition to the existing
    ASM (*,G) join
  * Find interface bsaed on default route with best metric
  * Initial support for IPv6 (*,G) and (S,G) joins

- Update to version 2.3
  * Automatically detect default interface
  * Enable support for multiple mcjoin receivers on one host using
    the same destination (Internet) port
  * Fix #1: Receiver does not stop after count received packets
  * Avoid using GLIBC extension `__progname`
