%description
mcjoin can be used to join IPv4 multicast groups, display
progress as multicast packets are received, and also send
multicast packets on select groups.

mcjoin can help verify intended IGMP snooping functionality
in layer-2 bridges/switches, as well as test forwarding of
multicast in static or dynamic multicast routing setups.
