  <title>Check memory plugin for Nagios</title>
  <description>We have always monitored RAM usage on all of boxes. Sure, there's the argument
that unused RAM is money wasted, but I always like to know not just when the
box is swapping, but when it's about to start swapping. There have been a few
plugins over the years that I've used for this - check_ram for Solaris,
check_mem for Linux, and there's also check_mem.pl.
