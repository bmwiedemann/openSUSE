Tue Feb 11 05:42:04 UTC 2025 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.8.0:
  * Blacklist:
    - Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe).
    - halloy (IRC client).
    - Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, 
      plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).
  * Fixes:
    - read_cfg didn't properly overwrite config options.
    - logging would sometimes crash if it returned an empty vec.
    - fix double-logging of avg fps.
    - nvidia: warn if both nvml and xnvctrl are unavailable.
    - mangoapp didn't properly respond to hide/show hud.
    - proper vsync implementation.
    - refactor FPS calculation in metrics.
    - fix exec, network, gpu and vram displaying incorrectly 
      in horizontal mode.
  * Changes:
    - Multiple GPUs can be displayed.
    - Changed logger errors to debug.
    - Added CPU power to logging.
    - Improved wayland keybinds.
    - Memory usage has been refactored to be inline with other apps.
    - DLSYM is enabled by default, MANGOHUD_DLSYM=0 to disable it.
    - mangoapp vulkan layer is deleted (it was a testing project 
      and no longer in development).
    + OpenGL shim:
      - The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library.
      - it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook 
        before loading mangohud.
      - this should resolve some crashes. More detailed 
        information here c22ced0.
    + If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using 
      steam-runtime-launch-client:
      - If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your 
        app to speak on org.freedesktop.Flatpak dbus address.
        Example if you're using mangohud in steam: 
        'flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak 
        com.valvesoftware.Steam'.
    + Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, 
      i915 and xe drivers):
      - Temperature is only available in linux 6.13+.
      - Temperature and Power Usage is not available 
        for integrated gpus.
      - VRAM and GPU Usage is per-process not per-system 
        (that would require root rights).
    + Multiple GPUs support:
      - By default, MangoHud displays all GPUs. 
        To select needed GPUs, you can use gpu_list or pci_dev.
  * Params:
    - 'network_color' sets the color of the network hud element.
    - 'display_server' shows if the display server is Xorg, 
       Xwayland or wayland.
    - 'gpu_list' set the GPUs to display in the hud e.g 'gpu_list=0,1'.
    - 'proc_mem' and io_read now works properly in gamescope 
      (mangoapp).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 26 15:09:29 UTC 2024 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Add BuildRequires xkbcommon.
- Update to version 0.7.2:
  * Changes:
    - time now has a label (you can remove this label with 
      time_no_label).
    - Wayland keybinds have been added.
    - rewritten exec function to have a persistent shell. 
      Should reduce frametime spikes when using exec.
    - exec is now right aligned to conform with every other item.
    - added a mutex for config to prevent some crashes when 
      accessing config at the same time as reloading.
    - winesync and refresh_rate have been changed to small font.
    - added more stats to log summary.
    - stop using intel_gpu_top, as it was causing too many issues. 
      We can still get GPU load but the rest we'll have to wait 
      for to be exposed in sysfs.
  * Fixes:
    - frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, 
      the user was not able to change it's color.
    - fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9.
    - config options now correctly override preset options.
    - fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds.
    - graphs had incorrect padding at start of graphs.
    - fixed a crash when reloading the config while logging.
    - check that cpu input gives a non-zero value.
    - fixed minecraft-launcher crashing.
    - graphs had incorrect padding leading to a smaller graph.
    - ixed a build issue where some meson options would exclude 
      opengl files incorrectly.
    - fixed presets not working with MANGOHUD_CONFIG env.
  * Parameters:
    - time_no_label removes the label before time.
    - network shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces 
      or a specified list of interfaces e.g network=eth0,wlo1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 29 04:11:09 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  * Parameters:
    - gpu_fan displays the gpu fan RPM, only works on AMD.
    - gpu_junction_temp displays the junction temperature on AMD GPUs.
    - removed io_stats, just use io_read and io_write instead.
    - engine_short_names shortens the names of engines, e.g VULKAN 
      becomes VK.
    - text_outline adds a colored outline around all text.
    - text_outline_color sets the color of the outline, 
      default: 000000.
    - text_outline_thickness sets the thickness of the outline,
      default: 1.5.
    - temp_fahrenheit changes all temps to fahrenheit from celsius.
    - dynamic_frame_timing dynamically changes the range of the 
      frametime graph.
    - duration displays the time since mangohud initialized.
    - gpu_voltage shows the current gpu voltage, only works on AMD.
    - fps_text override fps text.
    - horizontal_stretch sets the background to stretch across 
      width of application (enabled by default).
    - core_bars turns core_load into a histogram.
    - device_battery Shows battery level of wireless devices, 
      accepts gamepad mouse.
    - device_battery_icon shows battery icon instead of percent.
  * preset: This parameter allows you to choose from a number 
    of config presets.
    - 0: no display
    - 1: only fps.
    - 2: horizontal.
    - 3: more detailed default layout
    - 4: full
  * Changes:
    - Removed MANGOHUD_DLSYM because it's redundant.
    - Fixed core mhz when Cool'n'Quiet and similar is disabled 
      in bios.
    - Added /etc/MangoHud.conf as a possible config location.
    - Add CPU architecture to vulkan manifest name.
    - mangoplot is a python script that graphs one or more mangohud 
      csv logs.
    - mangoapp: resolved issue where different sized displays 
      caused rendering issues.
    - mangohud script: guard so we don't add mangohud 
      lib to LD_PRELOAD multiple times.
    - split mangohud into two shared libraries, one for vulkan and 
      one for opengl. This should resolve issues where mangohud 
      would init vulkan and opengl at the same time.
    - statically link stdc++. This fixed a lot of crashing issues 
      when MANGOHUD=1 was set before starting steam.
    - added support for zenergy kernel driver.
    - fixed alpha param that stopped working at some point.
    - added --version to mangohud script.

    - logging: calculate fps data using frametime.
    - AMDGPU: get core clock from hwmon instead of gpu_metrics.
    - gamepad_battery is now deprecated 
      use device_battery= mouse or gamepad.
    - logging: added process RSS and swap usage.
    - Fixed a memory leak when resizing vulkan windows.
  * Blacklist:
    - blacklist: if blacklisted application is hardcoded, 
      don't proceed to load config blacklists.
    - blacklist: only print blacklist info message once.
    + blacklist: added more hardcoded entries:
      - tabtip.exe
      - steam.exe
      - wine64-preloader
      - explorer.exe
      - wine-preloader
      - iexplore.exe
