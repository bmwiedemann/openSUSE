- Update to version 0.8.1
  * Maintenance release to update out of a yanked dependency.
- Update to version 0.8.0
  General improvements
  * feat: Specify different separators for each children group of
    a commutative parent.
  * fix: Avoid displaying spurious conflicts.
  * fix: Check that the merged text is syntactically valid and
    consistent with the merged tree.
  * fix: Handling of duplicate signatures in base revision.
  * fix: Don't match nodes of different types.
  * fix: Writing changeset to debug dir.
  Language-specific improvements
  * C/C++: Restrict commutativity of initializer_list.
  * C/C++: even more C++ file extensions.
  * C#: Restrict commutativity.
  * YAML: Fix handling of quoted strings.
- Update to version 0.7.0
  New languages
  * Java Properties (.properties).
  UX improvements
  * file formats can be selected manually using the new
    --language option.
  * zdiff3-style conflicts are detected and warned against, as
    Mergiraf doesn't support solving those.
  * using mergiraf solve together with jj gives a helpful error
    message.
  * the --keep option of mergiraf solve was renamed to --stdout.
  Bug fixes
  * Incorrect resolution of delete-delete conflict.
  * Spurious indentation changes on untouched nodes.
  * Missing file extensions for C++.
  * Unidentified conflict between --keep-backup and --stdout.
  * The --debug option was advertised in commands where it doesn't
    have any effect.
  * Java: Missing commutativity for 'throws' declarations.
  * Java: Missing commutativity in interfaces.
  * Python: Missing commutativity for "import from" statements.
  Performance
  * Many optimizations.

Sun Mar  2 22:33:07 UTC 2025 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 0.6.0:
  New language
  * SystemVerilog (*.sv, *.svh).
  * Nix (*.nix).
  New features
  * feat(LangProfile::detect_from_filename): handle extension
    comparison more correctly.
  * feat(MergedTree::line_based_local_fallback_for_revnode): handle
    the case of isomorphic left and right sides.
  * feat(line_based_merge_with_duplicate_signature_detection): if
    the line-merge has conflicts, reconstruct and check each
    revision.
  * feat: Add command to compare files by tree isomorphism.
  Fixes
  * fix(cli): add . to extensions in languages output.
  * fix(cli): add actual docs to --conflict-marker-size option.
  * fix(MergedTree/count_conflicts): respect conflict marker size.
  * fix(highlight_duplicate_signatures): don't remove separators
    if no conflict was built.
  * fix(TreeBuilder): resolve not-really-conflicts (left and right
    agree).
  Performance improvements
  * perf: use rustc-hash in more places.

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  Bugfix release

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  New languages
  * PHP
  * Solidity
  * TSX
  * Lua
  * Kotlin
  * Devicetree
  * Ruby
  Improvements
  * The histogram diff algorithm is used for line-based merges.
  * The mgf_dev parse command correctly displays nodes that have
    a signature and are commutative at the same time.
  * Don't add a newline at the end of merged / to-be-merged files.
  * Also parse correctly conflicts with non-newline-terminated
    sides.
  * The --keep-output option was added to the mergiraf solve to
    control the creation of .orig files.
  * The conflict size marker size can be controlled with option -l
  * The commutativity of various syntactic elements was restricted
    to avoid bad merges.
  * A --timeout option is available in mergiraf merge, to fall
    back on line-based merging if structured merging takes too
    long.
  * A panic when failing to commutatively merge a root node was
    fixed.
  Compatibility
  * Support for the MERGIRAF_DISABLE environment variable was
    removed, use mergiraf=0 instead.
  Performance
  * Many improvements reducing memory allocations.
