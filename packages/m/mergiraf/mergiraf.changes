  New languages

  * Solidity
  * TSX
  * Lua
  * Kotlin
  * Devicetree

  Improvements
  * The histogram diff algorithm is used for line-based merges.
  * The mgf_dev parse command correctly displays nodes that have
    a signature and are commutative at the same time.
  * Don't add a newline at the end of merged / to-be-merged files.
  * Also parse correctly conflicts with non-newline-terminated
    sides.
  * The --keep-output option was added to the mergiraf solve to
    control the creation of .orig files.
  * The conflict size marker size can be controlled with option -l
  * The commutativity of various syntactic elements was restricted
    to avoid bad merges.
  * A --timeout option is available in mergiraf merge, to fall
    back on line-based merging if structured merging takes too
    long.
  * A panic when failing to commutatively merge a root node was
    fixed.
  Compatibility
  * Support for the MERGIRAF_DISABLE environment variable was
    removed, use mergiraf=0 instead.
  Performance
  * Many improvements reducing memory allocations.
