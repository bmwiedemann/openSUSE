Fri Jan  7 15:06:27 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.21.1:
  + UI changes:
    - A new custom per-pane location display widget replaces the
      standard GTK+ file chooser button and our existing
      placeholder path display, including actions for opening
      containing folder and copying file paths.
    - Version control comparison has had its action bar modernised
      in line with file and folder comparison.

- Add typelib(GtkSource) = 4 requires: The code obscures a lot of
  logic, instead of requiring GtkSource 4, they require GtkSource
  (any version) and then runtime complain if it's not 4.
  (boo#1184842).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 15 03:21:00 UTC 2021 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + Make file comparison change navigation more intuitive by
    changing how it decides where to scroll from.
  + Completely refreshed Meld application icon.

    now all be toggled from the file comparison status bar.
  + Features:
    - Add support for CVS in version control comparisons.

    - Navigating between changes in file comparison now briefly
      animates the outline, to make it easier to keep track of the

      network mounts);
    - Keybindings for notebook switching work again;

    glgo#GNOME/meld#159, glgo#GNOME/meld#161, glgo#GNOME/meld#165.
  + Updated translations.
- Conditionalize shared-mime-info BuildRequires, glib2_gsettings_\
  schema_requires macro, and desktop_database_*, mime_database_*,
  glib2_gsettings_schema_* and icon_theme_cache_* post/postun
  scriptlets: only distribution releases where RPM 4.13 is not
  present still use them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 20 16:58:33 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Unconditionally enable translation-update-upstream: on
  Tumbleweed, this results in a NOP and for Leap in SLE paid
  translations being used (boo#1086036).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 28 16:37:05 UTC 2018 - dimstar@opensuse.org

    longer cause the second command to hang until the primary
    exits.
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#786629.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 3.17.3:
  + Fix folder compare when using text filters.

  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 11 10:23:35 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.17.2:
  + UI changes:
    - Significantly improve synchronisation of scroll bars between
      panes; we now try much harder to scroll all of a chunk on
      screen at the top and bottom of comparisons, and handle
      last-line-in-file cases better.
    - Place the cursor at the start of a replaced chunk instead of
      after it; this change should improve keyboard ergonomics when
      doing three-way merges, but does change our existing
      behaviour.
    - Remove Shift-based scroll locking; this was already broken by
      a GTK+ change, so this is just making it official.
  + Fixes:
    - Show correct column offset in status bar for tab indents.
    - Fix installation with a prefix for Python 3 changes.
    - Fix initial scroll-to-first-difference behaviour to avoid a
      race condition if the first change was on the first line.
    - Improve text wrapping behaviour in information bars, and
      avoid too-large allocations with long labels.
    - Work around infinite re-allocation problems and silence GTK+
      allocation warnings.
    - Fix bad UI state when closing a single-instance activated
      window.
    - Fix bad function call when using internal git conflict
      resolution.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 11 13:57:23 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.17.1:
  + Features: Improve version checking, and try to show users a
    nice error dialog when  Meld's requirements aren't installed.
  + Fixes:
    - Help and documentation fixes.
    - Re-silence GTK+ logging with glib 2.46 structured logging
      changes.
    - Fix chunk deletion at EOF with CRLF endings.
    - Note filter performance effects in folder preferences.
    - Fix button alignment for new chunk action buttons.
    - Improve use of the newer emblem in folder comparison by
      showing it only when meaningful.
    - Fix crash caused by bad colour theme lookup.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 13:25:53 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.17.0:
  + Port to python3:
    - Python 3 support; we now require Python 3.3 as a minimum.
    - Python 3 compatibility fixes; too many cases of bytes/string
      confusion, syntax changes and other miscellany to mention
      individually.
    - Handle new unicode-escape behaviour and unicode/bytes
      confusion for process interaction and version control
      plugins.
    - Add support for byte-based filters, to support directory vs.
      file comparison filters.
  + UI changes:
    - The "Tabs" menu item has been removed, to better match up
      with more modern GTK+ design. All of the actions are still
      available in the expected key bindings, and there is a new
      per-tab context menu.
    - The change action buttons in the central pane divider now
      correctly render as flat buttons.
    - The curves in the central pane divider are now... smoother!
  + Internal changes:
    - Handle reload notifications better in asynchronous saving.
    - Remove multi-process diff in favour of asynchronous
      (threaded, but GIL-throttled) matching.
    - Performance improvements in rendering of multiple widgets, as
      well as for initial text comparison.
    - Many updates for GTK+ 3.20 and 3.22 ABI changes.
  + Fixes:
    - Update supported version control list.
    - Update requirements and build requirements lists.
    - Don't create empty help/figures directories.
  + Updated translations.
- Update BuildRequires, Requires and Recommends in line with
  upstreams port to python3:
  + Removed: python, python-gconf, python-gobject-Gdk, python-gtk
    and python-gtksourceview.
  + Added: python3, python3-gobject-Gdk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Apr 23 22:45:54 UTC 2016 - michael@stroeder.com

- Require python-gobject-Gdk: pygobject was further split in order
  to be able to install it without X-dependencies. As meld is a
  GUI application, the dependency on the X-stack is no issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 12:48:49 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.15.2:
  + Port to use GtkSourceView's file loader and saver helpers,
    bringing several benefits.
  + Loading and saving speed are significantly improved, and are
    asychronous.
  + We try a wider range of locale-specific file encodings by
    default, and still support user-specified default encodings.
  + We now support saving files with inconsistent newline types.
  + Binary files will now be loaded on a best-effort basis.
  + Reinstate support for Darcs; this is currently limited to very
    new (>2.10.3) versions.
  + Folder comparisons now apply text filters in the same way as
    file comparisons.
  + Add support for showing new shortcuts help dialog.
  + Preliminary support for building Meld as an xdg-app.
  + Fixes:

      compatibility issues.
    - All accelerators should now consistently use the Primary key,
      for better integration on OSX systems.
    - Significantly improve text filter performance.
    - Fix performance regression where scanning for missing files
      was extremely slow, especially in large repositories.
    - Fix truncated line number display in short file.
    - Fix filter dropdown not appearing below button.
    - Add more documentation on setup and installation
      requirements.
    - Update the AppData to spec version 0.7+.
  + Updated translations.
