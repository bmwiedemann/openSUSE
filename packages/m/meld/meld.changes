  schema_requires macro, and desktop_database_*, mime_database_*,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 11 10:23:35 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.17.2:
  + UI changes:
    - Significantly improve synchronisation of scroll bars between
      panes; we now try much harder to scroll all of a chunk on
      screen at the top and bottom of comparisons, and handle
      last-line-in-file cases better.
    - Place the cursor at the start of a replaced chunk instead of
      after it; this change should improve keyboard ergonomics when
      doing three-way merges, but does change our existing
      behaviour.
    - Remove Shift-based scroll locking; this was already broken by
      a GTK+ change, so this is just making it official.
  + Fixes:
    - Show correct column offset in status bar for tab indents.
    - Fix installation with a prefix for Python 3 changes.
    - Fix initial scroll-to-first-difference behaviour to avoid a
      race condition if the first change was on the first line.
    - Improve text wrapping behaviour in information bars, and
      avoid too-large allocations with long labels.
    - Work around infinite re-allocation problems and silence GTK+
      allocation warnings.
    - Fix bad UI state when closing a single-instance activated
      window.
    - Fix bad function call when using internal git conflict
      resolution.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 11 13:57:23 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

    - Re-silence GTK+ logging with glib 2.46 structured logging
      changes.
    - Fix chunk deletion at EOF with CRLF endings.
    - Note filter performance effects in folder preferences.
    - Fix button alignment for new chunk action buttons.
    - Improve use of the newer emblem in folder comparison by
      showing it only when meaningful.
    - Fix crash caused by bad colour theme lookup.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 13:25:53 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.17.0:
  + Port to python3:
    - Python 3 support; we now require Python 3.3 as a minimum.
    - Python 3 compatibility fixes; too many cases of bytes/string
      confusion, syntax changes and other miscellany to mention
      individually.
    - Handle new unicode-escape behaviour and unicode/bytes
      confusion for process interaction and version control
      plugins.
    - Add support for byte-based filters, to support directory vs.
      file comparison filters.
  + UI changes:
    - The "Tabs" menu item has been removed, to better match up
      with more modern GTK+ design. All of the actions are still
      available in the expected key bindings, and there is a new
      per-tab context menu.
    - The change action buttons in the central pane divider now
      correctly render as flat buttons.
    - The curves in the central pane divider are now... smoother!
  + Internal changes:
    - Handle reload notifications better in asynchronous saving.
    - Remove multi-process diff in favour of asynchronous
      (threaded, but GIL-throttled) matching.
    - Performance improvements in rendering of multiple widgets, as
      well as for initial text comparison.
    - Many updates for GTK+ 3.20 and 3.22 ABI changes.
  + Fixes:
    - Update supported version control list.
    - Update requirements and build requirements lists.
    - Don't create empty help/figures directories.
  + Updated translations.
- Update BuildRequires, Requires and Recommends in line with
  upstreams port to python3:
  + Removed: python, python-gconf, python-gobject-Gdk, python-gtk
    and python-gtksourceview.
  + Added: python3, python3-gobject-Gdk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  to be able to install it without X-dependencies. As meld is a
  GUI application, the dependency on the X-stack is no issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 12:48:49 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.15.2:
  + Port to use GtkSourceView's file loader and saver helpers,
    bringing several benefits.
  + Loading and saving speed are significantly improved, and are
    asychronous.
  + We try a wider range of locale-specific file encodings by
    default, and still support user-specified default encodings.
  + We now support saving files with inconsistent newline types.
  + Binary files will now be loaded on a best-effort basis.
  + Reinstate support for Darcs; this is currently limited to very
    new (>2.10.3) versions.
  + Folder comparisons now apply text filters in the same way as
    file comparisons.
  + Add support for showing new shortcuts help dialog.
  + Preliminary support for building Meld as an xdg-app.

    - Add more documentation on setup and installation
      requirements.
    - Update the AppData to spec version 0.7+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 20 21:53:26 UTC 2015 - damjanovic.ivo@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.15.1:
  + Text ignored by filters is now dimmed to give some visual
    feedback that it's being ignored.
  + Text filters now apply independently, improving consistency;
    note that this is a behaviour change as filter order no longer
    matters, and filters will always apply to the original
    (not the filtered) text.
  + Recent menu items now show more detail in tooltips.
  + Update dialog action area layout for GTK+ theme changes.
  + Fixes:
    - Conflict resolution prompt now resolves properly again.
