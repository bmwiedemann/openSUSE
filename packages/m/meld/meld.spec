%description
Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. Two or three files can be
compared and be edited in place. (The diffs update dynamically). Two
or three directories can be compared and file comparisons be launched.
The working copy directory from version control systems such as CVS,
Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial can be browsed and viewed.
