  <description>MoinMoin is an advanced, easy to use and extensible wiki engine with a large community of users. Said in a few words, it is about collaboration on easily editable web pages. All wiki data is stored in plain files - no database is required.

MoinMoin is implemented in Python.

This package configures MoinMoin to serve wiki pages via the Apache web server.
