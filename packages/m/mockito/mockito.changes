- Update to version 5.11.0
- Changes of the 5.x line
  * Mockito 5 is making core changes to ensure compatibility with
    future JDK versions.
  * Switch the Default MockMaker to mockito-inline (not applicable
    to mockito-android)
    + Mockito 2.7.6 introduced the mockito-inline mockmaker based on
      the "inline bytecode" principle, offering compatibility
      advantages over the subclass mockmaker.
    + This change avoids JDK restrictions, such as violating module
      boundaries and leaking subclass creation.
  * Legitimate use cases for the subclass mockmaker
    + scenarios where the inline mockmaker does not function, such
      as on Graal VM's native image.
    + Additionally, if avoiding mocking final classes, the subclass
      mockmaker remains a viable option, although issues may arise
      on JDK 17+.
    + Mockito aims to support both mockmakers, allowing users to
      choose based on their requirements.
  * Update the Minimum Supported Java Version to 11
    + Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above, but Mockito 5 raises the
      minimum supported Java version to 11.
    + Community member @reta contributed to this change.
    + Users still on JDK 8 can continue using Mockito 4, with
      minimal API differences between versions.
  * New type() Method on ArgumentMatcher
    + The ArgumentMatcher interface now includes a new type() method
      to support varargs methods, addressing previous limitations.
    + Users can now differentiate between matching calls with any
      exact number of arguments or match any number of arguments.
    + Mockito 5 provides a default implementation of the new method,
      ensuring backward compatibility.
    + No obligation for users to implement the new method; Mockito 5
      considers Void.type by default for varargs handling.
    + ArgumentCaptor is now fully type-aware, enabling capturing
      specific subclasses on a generic method.
- Removed patches:
  * fix-bnd-config.patch
  * fix-incompatible-types.patch
  * fixup-ant-script.patch
  * mockito-matcher.patch
  * remove-hardcoded-source-target.patch
  * setting-naming-policy.patch
    + not needed by this version
- Added patches:
  * keep-source-target-8.patch
    + make the code again buildable with --release 8
  * use-unbundled-asm.patch
    + adapt to our change of byte-buddy, where it does not bundle
      asm, but uses objectweb-asm as external library
