#Description: reduce the rust debuginfo level on selected architectures where
# compiling with debuginfo=2 causes the OOM killer to interrupt the build on
# launchpad builders. Initially this was only on 32 bit architectures, but with
# firefox 63 it started happening frequently on arm64 and ppc64el too.
