Fri Mar 26 12:39:34 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.30.1
  This release is identical to Synapse 1.30.0, with the exception
  of explicitly setting a minimum version of Python's Cryptography
  library to ensure that users of Synapse are protected from the
  recent OpenSSL security advisories, especially CVE-2021-3449.
  - Internal Changes
    - Enforce that `cryptography` dependency is up to date to
      ensure it has the most recent openssl patches. (#9697)
  
- Note: we do not bump the cryptography dependency in our package
  as we use the system OpenSSL which gets the fix.
  
  Add dont-bump-cryptography-with-system-openssl.patch to comment
  out the dependency because otherwise the newer version
  requirement is enforced on startup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 22 14:02:31 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.30.0
  Note that this release deprecates the ability for appservices to
  call POST /_matrix/client/r0/register without the body parameter
  type. Appservice developers should use a type value of
  m.login.application_service as per the spec. In future releases,
  calling this endpoint with an access token - but without a
  m.login.application_service type - will fail.

  - Features
    - Add prometheus metrics for number of users successfully
      registering and logging in. (#9510, #9511, #9573)
    - Add synapse_federation_last_sent_pdu_time and
      synapse_federation_last_received_pdu_time prometheus metrics,
      which monitor federation delays by reporting the timestamps
      of messages sent and received to a set of remote servers.

    - Fix re-activating an account via the admin API when local
      passwords are disabled. (#9587)
    - Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.20 which caused incoming
      federation transactions to stack up, causing slow recovery
      from outages. (#9597)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.28.0 where the OpenID Connect
      callback endpoint could error with a MacaroonInitException.
      (#9620)

    - The synapse_federation_last_sent_pdu_age and
      synapse_federation_last_received_pdu_age prometheus metrics
      have been removed. They are replaced by
      synapse_federation_last_sent_pdu_time and
      synapse_federation_last_received_pdu_time. (#9540)
    - Registering an Application Service user without using the
      m.login.application_service login type will be unsupported in
      an upcoming Synapse release. (#9559)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 25 22:00:48 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.28.0
  This release fixes the documentation included in v1.27.0 around
  the callback URI for SAML2 identity providers. If your server is
  configured to use single sign-on via a SAML2 IdP, you may need to
  make configuration changes. Please review UPGRADE.rst for more
  details on these changes.

  Removal warning
  - The v1 list accounts API is deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. This API was undocumented and misleading. It
    can be replaced by the v2 list accounts API, which has been
    available since Synapse 1.7.0 (2019-12-13).

  - Please check if you're using any scripts which use the admin
    API and replace GET /_synapse/admin/v1/users/<user_id> with GET
    /_synapse/admin/v2/users.

  - Features
    - New admin API to get the context of an event:
      /_synapse/admin/rooms/{roomId}/context/{eventId}. (#9150)

      compliance. (#9321, #9393)
    - Fix additional errors when previewing URLs: "AttributeError
      'NoneType' object has no attribute 'xpath'" and "ValueError:
      Unicode strings with encoding declaration are not supported.
      Please use bytes input or XML fragments without
      declaration.". (#9333)
    - Fix a bug causing Synapse to impose the wrong type
      constraints on fields when processing responses from
      appservices to /_matrix/app/v1/thirdparty/user/{protocol}.
      (#9361)
    - Fix bug where Synapse would occasionally stop reconnecting to
      Redis after the connection was lost. (#9391)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 16 14:12:41 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.27.0 
  Note that this release includes a change in Synapse to use Redis
  as a cache ─ as well as a pub/sub mechanism ─ if Redis support is
  enabled for workers. No action is needed by server
  administrators, and we do not expect resource usage of the Redis
  instance to change dramatically.

  This release also changes the callback URI for OpenID Connect
  (OIDC) identity providers. If your server is configured to use
  single sign-on via an OIDC/OAuth2 IdP, you may need to make
  configuration changes. Please review UPGRADE.rst for more details
  on these changes.

  This release also changes escaping of variables in the HTML
  templates for SSO or email notifications. If you have customised
  these templates, please review UPGRADE.rst for more details on
  these changes.

      an empty dictionary if an empty module config block was
      provided in the homeserver config. (#9229)
    - Fix a bug in the make_room_admin admin API where it failed if
      the admin with the greatest power level was not in the room.
      Contributed by Pankaj Yadav. (#9235)
    - Prevent password hashes from getting dropped if a client

Wed Jan 13 12:28:54 UTC 2021 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.25.0 
  Ending Support for Python 3.5 and Postgres 9.5 With this release,
  the Synapse team is announcing a formal deprecation policy for
  our platform dependencies, like Python and PostgreSQL:

  All future releases of Synapse will follow the upstream
  end-of-life schedules.

  Which means:

  This is the last release which guarantees support for Python 3.5.
  We will end support for PostgreSQL 9.5 early next month.  We will
  end support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 near the end of the
  year.  Crucially, this means we will not produce .deb packages
  for Debian 9 (Stretch) or Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) beyond the
  transition period described below.

  The website https://endoflife.date/ has convenient summaries of
  the support schedules for projects like Python and PostgreSQL.

  If you are unable to upgrade your environment to a supported
  version of Python or Postgres, we encourage you to consider using
  the Synapse Docker images instead.

  Transition Period We will make a good faith attempt to avoid
  breaking compatibility in all releases through the end of March
  2021. However, critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
  or other unanticipated circumstances may arise which necessitate
  breaking compatibility earlier.

  We intend to continue producing .deb packages for Debian 9
  (Stretch) and Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) through the transition
  period.

  Removal warning The old Purge Room API and Shutdown Room API are
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They will be
  replaced by the Delete Room APIe

	POST /_synapse/admin/v1/rooms/<room_id>/delete replaces
  POST /_synapse/admin/v1/purge_room and
	POST /_synapse/admin/v1/shutdown_room/<room_id>.

- Update to 1.24.0

  Due to the two security issues highlighted below, server
  administrators are encouraged to update Synapse. We are not aware
  of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

  - Security
    - There is a denial of service attack (CVE-2020-26257) against
      the federation APIs in which future events will not be
      correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects
      all servers that participate in open federation. (Fixed in
      #8776).
    - Synapse may be affected by OpenSSL CVE-2020-1971.
      Synapse administrators should ensure that they have the
      latest versions of the cryptography Python package installed.

    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0 which caused the
      synapse_port_db script to fail. (#8386)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0 which caused variables to be

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 16:29:17 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.20.0
  - Removal warning
    - Some older clients used a disallowed character (:) in the
      client_secret parameter of various endpoints. The incorrect
      behaviour was allowed for backwards compatibility, but is now
      being removed from Synapse as most users have updated their
      client. Further context can be found at #6766.
    - Historically, the Synapse Admin API has been accessible under
      the prefixes:
      /_matrix/client/api/v1/admin,
      /_matrix/client/unstable/admin,
      /_matrix/client/r0/admin
      /_synapse/admin

      In a future release, we will be dropping support for
      accessing Synapse's Admin API using the /_matrix/client/*
      prefixes. This makes it easier for homeserver admins to lock
      down external access to the Admin API endpoints.
  - Features
    - Add flags to the /versions endpoint for whether new rooms
      default to using E2EE. (#8343)
    - Add an endpoint to query your shared rooms with another user
      as an implementation of MSC2666. (#7785)
    - Iteratively encode JSON to avoid blocking the reactor.
      (#8013, #8116)
    - Add support for shadow-banning users (ignoring any message
      send requests). (#8034, #8092, #8095, #8142, #8152, #8157,
      #8158, #8176)
    - Use the default template file when its equivalent is not
      found in a custom template directory. (#8037, #8107, #8252)
    - Add unread messages count to sync responses, as specified in
      MSC2654. (#8059, #8254, #8270, #8274)
    - Optimise /federation/v1/user/devices/ API by only returning
      devices with encryption keys. (#8198)
  - Bugfixes
    - Fix rate limiting of federation /send requests. (#8342)
    - Fix a longstanding bug where back pagination over federation
      could get stuck if it failed to handle a received event.
      (#8349)
    - Partially mitigate bug where newly joined servers couldn't
      get past events in a room when there is a malformed event.
      (#8350)
    - Fix joining rooms over federation that include malformed
      events.  (#8324)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0rc1 where the wrong exception
      was raised when invalid JSON data is encountered.  (#8291)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0rc1 causing some features
      related to notifications to misbehave following the
      implementation of unread counts. (#8280)
    - Fix a memory leak by limiting the length of time that
      messages will be queued for a remote server that has been
      unreachable. (#7864)
    - Fix Re-starting finished log context PUT-nnnn warning when

    * Fix a bug causing Synapse to misinterpret the value off for
      encryption_enabled_by_default_for_room_type in its configuration file(s)
      if that value isn't surrounded by quotes. This bug was introduced in
      v1.16.0.

      templates, including e.g. for registration emails.
    * Errors which occur while using the non-standard JWT login now return the
      proper error: 403 Forbidden with an error code of M_FORBIDDEN.

Thu Jul  2 15:34:54 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.15.2
  - Security
    - A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state
      in a room to a small subset of the correct state. This
      affects all Synapse deployments which federate with untrusted
      servers. (96e9afe6)
    - HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking
      attacks. This predominantly affects homeservers with
      single-sign-on enabled, but all server administrators are
      encouraged to upgrade. (ea26e9a9)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 14:54:57 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.13.0
  This release brings some potential changes necessary for certain
  configurations of Synapse:

  - If your Synapse is configured to use SSO and have a custom
    sso_redirect_confirm_template_dir configuration option set, you
    will need to duplicate the new sso_auth_confirm.html,
    sso_auth_success.html and sso_account_deactivated.html
    templates into that directory.
  - Synapse plugins using the complete_sso_login method of
    synapse.module_api.ModuleApi should instead switch to the
    async/await version, complete_sso_login_async, which includes
    additional checks. The former version is now deprecated.
  - A bug was introduced in Synapse 1.4.0 which could cause the
    room directory to be incomplete or empty if Synapse was
    upgraded directly from v1.2.1 or earlier, to versions between
    v1.4.0 and v1.12.x.

  Please review UPGRADE.rst for more details on these changes and
  for general upgrade guidance.

  For the complete list of changes please refer to
  https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.13.0

Tue Mar 24 15:31:47 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- use %requires_eq for runtime dependencies to make sure we always
  use the versions we built with. we ran into cases where the
  distro package was new enough according to the setup dependencies
  but those were not up2date with the actual code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 14:36:36 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.12.0
  Synapse may be vulnerable to request-smuggling attacks when it is
  used with a reverse-proxy. The vulnerabilties are fixed in
  Twisted 20.3.0, and are described in
  [CVE-2020-10108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10108)
  and
  [CVE-2020-10109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10109).
  For a good introduction to this class of request-smuggling
  attacks, see
  https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn.

  We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the
  wild, and do not believe that they are exploitable with current
  versions of any reverse proxies. Nevertheless, we recommend that
  all Synapse administrators ensure that they have the latest
  versions of the Twisted library to ensure that their installation
  remains secure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 16:06:38 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- package cleanup
  - make sure we have all libraries to actually install the package:
    - buildrequires all runtime requirements
    - (build)require python3-typing_extensions
  - having it use the python package name is not really useful here.
  - refreshed and renamed better-paths.patch to
    matrix-synapse-1.4.1-paths.patch
  - also fix existing synapse user
    - group to synapse instead of nogroup
    - home directory to /var/lib/matrix-synapse
    - shell to /bin/false (which actually exists)
  - improvements to the logging configuration:
    - install copy of the current /etc/matrix-synapse/log.yaml as
      /etc/matrix-synapse/log.systemd.yaml
    - install /etc/matrix-synapse/log.file.yaml which logs to
      /var/log/matrix-synapse/homeserver.log
    - add the log directory /var/log/matrix-synapse/
  - added README.SUSE
  - better way to bootstrap a new config:
    1. ExecStartPre would have never worked anyway
    2. added %{_sbindir}/matrix-synapse-generate-config
    Usage:
    %{_sbindir}/matrix-synapse-generate-config servername
  - fix group and shell for the synapse user
  - added better-paths.patch
    - put the pid file into /run/matrix-synapse/
    - use a default logging config in /etc/matrix-synapse/log.yaml
      to have systemd logging by default
  - use full path in the service file
  - actually use source 50 instead of the service file in the tarball
  - make permissions tighter on the config files as it contains
    passwords and other secrets:
    root:synapse u=rwX,g=rX,o=

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 13:45:22 UTC 2020 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0.

  WARNING: As of this release, Synapse no longer supports versions of SQLite
  before 3.11, and will refuse to start when configured to use an older
  version. Administrators are recommended to migrate their database to Postgres
  (see instructions here).

  WARNING: If your Synapse deployment uses workers, note that the reverse-proxy
  configurations for the synapse.app.media_repository,
  synapse.app.federation_reader and synapse.app.event_creator workers have
  changed, with the addition of a few paths (see the updated configurations
  here). Existing configurations will continue to work.

  + Allow admin to create or modify a user.
  + Add new quarantine media admin APIs to quarantine by media ID or by user
    who uploaded the media.
  + Add a new admin API to list and filter rooms on the server.
  + Add org.matrix.e2e_cross_signing to unstable_features in /versions.

  WARNING: As of this release Synapse will refuse to start if the log_file
  config option is specified. Support for the option was removed in v1.3.0.

  * Add v2 APIs for the send_join and send_leave federation endpoints (as
    described in MSC1802).
  * Add a develop script to generate full SQL schemas.
  * Add custom SAML username mapping functinality through an external provider
    plugin.
  * Automatically delete empty groups/communities.
  * Add option limit_profile_requests_to_users_who_share_rooms to prevent
    requirement of a local user sharing a room with another user to query their
    profile information.
  * Add an export_signing_key script to extract the public part of signing keys
    when rotating them.
  * Add experimental config option to specify multiple databases.
  * Raise an error if someone tries to use the log_file config option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  5 15:29:57 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.0.

  As of v1.1.0, Synapse no longer supports Python 2, nor Postgres version 9.4.
  Thus, we no longer package a Python 2 version of this package. Some other key
  changes include:

  * Allow server admins to define implementations of extra rules for allowing
    or denying incoming events.
  * Add --data-dir and --open-private-ports options.

    database, reducing database load.

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.
- Rebase patches:
  * 0001-requirements-prometheus_client.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 08:16:05 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Obsolete the old split-Python packages, so that upgrading works smoothly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 10:48:03 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Un-Requires prometheus_client<0.4.0. The Requires made it impossible to use
  matrix-synapse on openSUSE for very little good reason (prometheus metrics
  will still work on post-0.4.0 prometheus_client, but with changed names).
  Debian and many other distributions do the same here.
  + 0001-requirements-prometheus_client.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 02:26:48 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.0.

  This is the first stable release of synapse. It includes a large number of
  changes but the highlights are:

  * Ability to configured default room version (with the default now being v4,
    which has improved state resolution algorithms and event IDs).
  * The complete removal of "perspectives" support, with all homeservers now
    being required to use valid TLS certificates (there has been a transition
    period for several months from the release of 0.99).
  * Experimental support for "relations" (reactions and edits).

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 31 00:04:50 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.5.2.

  Fix bug where we leaked extremities when we soft failed events, leading to
  performance degradation.

  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 28 01:18:34 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  8 00:47:56 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.3.2.

  This includes two security fixes:
    * Switch to using a cryptographically-secure random number generator for
      token strings, ensuring they cannot be predicted by an attacker.
    * Blacklist 0.0.0.0 and :: by default for URL previews.

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 14 18:35:48 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.3.

  The primary changes to previous versions are that self-signed certificates
  will no longer be generated, and instead LetsEncrypt certificates will be
  requested instead. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version,
  because pre-0.99 servers (using self-signed certificates and the perspectives
  system) will no longer be able to federate with post-1.0 servers.

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 11:18:46 UTC 2018 - okurz@suse.com

- Update to version v0.28.1:
 * SECURITY UPDATE
    Clamp the allowed values of event depth received over federation to be
    [0, 2^63 - 1]. This mitigates an attack where malicious events
    injected with depth = 2^63 - 1 render rooms unusable. Depth is used to
    determine the cosmetic ordering of events within a room, and so the ordering
    of events in such a room will default to using stream_ordering rather than depth
    (topological_ordering).

    This is a temporary solution to mitigate abuse in the wild, whilst a long term solution
    is being implemented to improve how the depth parameter is used.

    Full details at
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI/edit#
