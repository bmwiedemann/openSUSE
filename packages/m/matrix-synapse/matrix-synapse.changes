Thu Sep 24 19:02:21 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.20.1
  - Bugfixes
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0 which caused the
      synapse_port_db script to fail. (#8386)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0 which caused variables to be

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 18 16:29:17 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.20.0
  - Removal warning
    - Some older clients used a disallowed character (:) in the
      client_secret parameter of various endpoints. The incorrect
      behaviour was allowed for backwards compatibility, but is now
      being removed from Synapse as most users have updated their
      client. Further context can be found at #6766.
    - Historically, the Synapse Admin API has been accessible under
      the prefixes:
      /_matrix/client/api/v1/admin,
      /_matrix/client/unstable/admin,
      /_matrix/client/r0/admin
      /_synapse/admin

      In a future release, we will be dropping support for
      accessing Synapse's Admin API using the /_matrix/client/*
      prefixes. This makes it easier for homeserver admins to lock
      down external access to the Admin API endpoints.
  - Features
    - Add flags to the /versions endpoint for whether new rooms
      default to using E2EE. (#8343)
    - Add an endpoint to query your shared rooms with another user
      as an implementation of MSC2666. (#7785)
    - Iteratively encode JSON to avoid blocking the reactor.
      (#8013, #8116)
    - Add support for shadow-banning users (ignoring any message
      send requests). (#8034, #8092, #8095, #8142, #8152, #8157,
      #8158, #8176)
    - Use the default template file when its equivalent is not
      found in a custom template directory. (#8037, #8107, #8252)
    - Add unread messages count to sync responses, as specified in
      MSC2654. (#8059, #8254, #8270, #8274)
    - Optimise /federation/v1/user/devices/ API by only returning
      devices with encryption keys. (#8198)
  - Bugfixes
    - Fix rate limiting of federation /send requests. (#8342)
    - Fix a longstanding bug where back pagination over federation
      could get stuck if it failed to handle a received event.
      (#8349)
    - Partially mitigate bug where newly joined servers couldn't
      get past events in a room when there is a malformed event.
      (#8350)
    - Fix joining rooms over federation that include malformed
      events.  (#8324)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0rc1 where the wrong exception
      was raised when invalid JSON data is encountered.  (#8291)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.20.0rc1 causing some features
      related to notifications to misbehave following the
      implementation of unread counts. (#8280)
    - Fix a memory leak by limiting the length of time that
      messages will be queued for a remote server that has been
      unreachable. (#7864)
    - Fix Re-starting finished log context PUT-nnnn warning when
      event persistence failed. (#8081)
    - Synapse now correctly enforces the valid characters in the
      client_secret parameter used in various endpoints. (#8101)
    - Fix a bug introduced in v1.7.2 impacting message retention
      policies that would allow federated homeservers to dictate a
      retention period that's lower than the configured minimum
      allowed duration in the configuration file. (#8104)
    - Fix a long-standing bug where invalid JSON would be accepted
      by Synapse. (#8106)
    - Fix a bug introduced in Synapse v1.12.0 which could cause
      /sync requests to fail with a 404 if you had a very old
      outstanding room invite. (#8110)
    - Return a proper error code when the rooms of an invalid group
      are requested. (#8129)
    - Fix a bug which could cause a leaked postgres connection if
      synapse was set to daemonize. (#8131)
    - Clarify the error code if a user tries to register with a
      numeric ID. This bug was introduced in v1.15.0. (#8135)
    - Fix a bug where appservices with ratelimiting disabled would
      still be ratelimited when joining rooms. This bug was
      introduced in v1.19.0. (#8139)
    - Fix logging in via OpenID Connect with a provider that uses
      integer user IDs. (#8190)
    - Fix a longstanding bug where user directory updates could
      break when unexpected profile data was included in events.
      (#8223)
    - Fix a longstanding bug where stats updates could break when
      unexpected profile data was included in events. (#8226)

      scan of the users table from startup code. (#8271)
  - Improved Documentation
    - Link to matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider in the password
      provider documentation. (#8111)
    - Updated documentation to note that Synapse does not follow
      HTTP 308 redirects due to an upstream library not supporting
      them. Contributed by Ryan Cole. (#8120)
    - Explain better what GDPR-erased means when deactivating a
      user. (#8189)
  - Internal Changes
    - Blacklist MSC2753 SyTests until it is implemented. (#8285)
    - Add filter name to the /users admin API, which filters by
      user ID or displayname. Contributed by Awesome Technologies
      Innovationslabor GmbH. (#7377, #8163)
    - Reduce run times of some unit tests by advancing the reactor
      a fewer number of times. (#7757)
    - Don't fail /submit_token requests on incorrect session ID if

      from remote users.
    * Fix bug where Synapse fails to process an incoming event over federation
      if the server is missing too much of the event's auth chain.
    * Fix a bug causing Synapse to misinterpret the value off for
      encryption_enabled_by_default_for_room_type in its configuration file(s)
      if that value isn't surrounded by quotes. This bug was introduced in
      v1.16.0.

      templates, including e.g. for registration emails.
    * Errors which occur while using the non-standard JWT login now return the
      proper error: 403 Forbidden with an error code of M_FORBIDDEN.

Thu Jul  2 15:34:54 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.15.2
  - Security
    - A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state
      in a room to a small subset of the correct state. This
      affects all Synapse deployments which federate with untrusted
      servers. (96e9afe6)
    - HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 19 14:54:57 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.13.0
  This release brings some potential changes necessary for certain
  configurations of Synapse:

  - If your Synapse is configured to use SSO and have a custom
    sso_redirect_confirm_template_dir configuration option set, you
    will need to duplicate the new sso_auth_confirm.html,
    sso_auth_success.html and sso_account_deactivated.html
    templates into that directory.
  - Synapse plugins using the complete_sso_login method of
    synapse.module_api.ModuleApi should instead switch to the
    async/await version, complete_sso_login_async, which includes
    additional checks. The former version is now deprecated.
  - A bug was introduced in Synapse 1.4.0 which could cause the
    room directory to be incomplete or empty if Synapse was
    upgraded directly from v1.2.1 or earlier, to versions between
    v1.4.0 and v1.12.x.

  Please review UPGRADE.rst for more details on these changes and
  for general upgrade guidance.

  For the complete list of changes please refer to
  https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.13.0

      users who did not share a room with any user on the local
      homeserver. (#7289)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 24 15:31:47 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- use %requires_eq for runtime dependencies to make sure we always
  use the versions we built with. we ran into cases where the
  distro package was new enough according to the setup dependencies
  but those were not up2date with the actual code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 14:36:36 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 1.12.0
  Synapse may be vulnerable to request-smuggling attacks when it is
  used with a reverse-proxy. The vulnerabilties are fixed in
  Twisted 20.3.0, and are described in
  [CVE-2020-10108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10108)
  and
  [CVE-2020-10109](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10109).
  For a good introduction to this class of request-smuggling
  attacks, see
  https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn.

  We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the
  wild, and do not believe that they are exploitable with current
  versions of any reverse proxies. Nevertheless, we recommend that
  all Synapse administrators ensure that they have the latest
  versions of the Twisted library to ensure that their installation
  remains secure.

      ([MSC2432](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2432)):
      - Publishing/removing a room from the room directory now

Thu Jan 23 16:06:38 UTC 2020 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- package cleanup
  - make sure we have all libraries to actually install the package:
    - buildrequires all runtime requirements
    - (build)require python3-typing_extensions
  - having it use the python package name is not really useful here.
  - refreshed and renamed better-paths.patch to
    matrix-synapse-1.4.1-paths.patch
  - also fix existing synapse user
    - group to synapse instead of nogroup
    - home directory to /var/lib/matrix-synapse
    - shell to /bin/false (which actually exists)
  - improvements to the logging configuration:
    - install copy of the current /etc/matrix-synapse/log.yaml as
      /etc/matrix-synapse/log.systemd.yaml
    - install /etc/matrix-synapse/log.file.yaml which logs to
      /var/log/matrix-synapse/homeserver.log
    - add the log directory /var/log/matrix-synapse/
  - added README.SUSE
  - better way to bootstrap a new config:
    1. ExecStartPre would have never worked anyway
    2. added %{_sbindir}/matrix-synapse-generate-config
    Usage:
    %{_sbindir}/matrix-synapse-generate-config servername
  - fix group and shell for the synapse user
  - added better-paths.patch
    - put the pid file into /run/matrix-synapse/
    - use a default logging config in /etc/matrix-synapse/log.yaml
      to have systemd logging by default
  - use full path in the service file
  - actually use source 50 instead of the service file in the tarball
  - make permissions tighter on the config files as it contains
    passwords and other secrets:
    root:synapse u=rwX,g=rX,o=

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 23 13:45:22 UTC 2020 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.9.0.

  WARNING: As of this release, Synapse no longer supports versions of SQLite
  before 3.11, and will refuse to start when configured to use an older
  version. Administrators are recommended to migrate their database to Postgres
  (see instructions here).

  WARNING: If your Synapse deployment uses workers, note that the reverse-proxy
  configurations for the synapse.app.media_repository,
  synapse.app.federation_reader and synapse.app.event_creator workers have
  changed, with the addition of a few paths (see the updated configurations
  here). Existing configurations will continue to work.

  + Allow admin to create or modify a user.
  + Add new quarantine media admin APIs to quarantine by media ID or by user
    who uploaded the media.
  + Add a new admin API to list and filter rooms on the server.
  + Add org.matrix.e2e_cross_signing to unstable_features in /versions.

  WARNING: As of this release Synapse will refuse to start if the log_file
  config option is specified. Support for the option was removed in v1.3.0.

  * Add v2 APIs for the send_join and send_leave federation endpoints (as
    described in MSC1802).
  * Add a develop script to generate full SQL schemas.
  * Add custom SAML username mapping functinality through an external provider
    plugin.
  * Automatically delete empty groups/communities.
  * Add option limit_profile_requests_to_users_who_share_rooms to prevent
    requirement of a local user sharing a room with another user to query their
    profile information.
  * Add an export_signing_key script to extract the public part of signing keys
    when rotating them.
  * Add experimental config option to specify multiple databases.
  * Raise an error if someone tries to use the log_file config option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  5 15:29:57 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.0.

  As of v1.1.0, Synapse no longer supports Python 2, nor Postgres version 9.4.
  Thus, we no longer package a Python 2 version of this package. Some other key
  changes include:

  * Allow server admins to define implementations of extra rules for allowing
    or denying incoming events.
  * Add --data-dir and --open-private-ports options.

  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.
- Rebase patches:
  * 0001-requirements-prometheus_client.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 28 08:16:05 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Obsolete the old split-Python packages, so that upgrading works smoothly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 25 10:48:03 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Un-Requires prometheus_client<0.4.0. The Requires made it impossible to use
  matrix-synapse on openSUSE for very little good reason (prometheus metrics
  will still work on post-0.4.0 prometheus_client, but with changed names).
  Debian and many other distributions do the same here.
  + 0001-requirements-prometheus_client.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 02:26:48 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 1.0.0.

  This is the first stable release of synapse. It includes a large number of
  changes but the highlights are:

  * Ability to configured default room version (with the default now being v4,
    which has improved state resolution algorithms and event IDs).
  * The complete removal of "perspectives" support, with all homeservers now
    being required to use valid TLS certificates (there has been a transition
    period for several months from the release of 0.99).
  * Experimental support for "relations" (reactions and edits).

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 31 00:04:50 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.5.2.

  Fix bug where we leaked extremities when we soft failed events, leading to
  performance degradation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  8 00:47:56 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.3.2.

  This includes two security fixes:
    * Switch to using a cryptographically-secure random number generator for
      token strings, ensuring they cannot be predicted by an attacker.
    * Blacklist 0.0.0.0 and :: by default for URL previews.

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 14 18:35:48 UTC 2019 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>

- Update to 0.99.3.

  The primary changes to previous versions are that self-signed certificates
  will no longer be generated, and instead LetsEncrypt certificates will be
  requested instead. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version,
  because pre-0.99 servers (using self-signed certificates and the perspectives
  system) will no longer be able to federate with post-1.0 servers.

  The full changelog is included in
  /usr/share/doc/packages/matrix-synapse/CHANGES.md.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  4 11:18:46 UTC 2018 - okurz@suse.com

- Update to version v0.28.1:
 * SECURITY UPDATE
    Clamp the allowed values of event depth received over federation to be
    [0, 2^63 - 1]. This mitigates an attack where malicious events
    injected with depth = 2^63 - 1 render rooms unusable. Depth is used to
    determine the cosmetic ordering of events within a room, and so the ordering
    of events in such a room will default to using stream_ordering rather than depth
    (topological_ordering).

    This is a temporary solution to mitigate abuse in the wild, whilst a long term solution
    is being implemented to improve how the depth parameter is used.

    Full details at
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI/edit#
