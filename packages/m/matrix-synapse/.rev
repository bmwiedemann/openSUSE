    <comment>Resubmission of matrix-synapse -- the build failure has been fixed (txacme is
an optional dependency, only used when synapse is set up to manage its own ACME
certificates -- which is a very common setup, but it's better to have a
mostly-working synapse than nothing at all) and the package has been update to
1.4.0.</comment>
