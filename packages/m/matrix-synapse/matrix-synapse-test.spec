# synapse only supports python >= 3.5, which is not available on pre-15 Leap.
# However, future versions of matrix-synapse will no longer support python2 and
# continued use of python2 is not recommended, so we only use the primary
# python3 flavor. As a result, at no point do we have two versions of the
# matrix-synapse package.

# Disable debug packages since we're not installing anything.
