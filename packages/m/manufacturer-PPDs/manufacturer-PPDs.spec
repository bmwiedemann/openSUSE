# Howto make Source0:
# Visit http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/ and note the directories
# which contain PPD files - for example:
#   http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/all_in_one/
#   http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/business_inkjet/
#   http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/color_laser/
#   http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/designjet/
#   http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/HP/mono_laser/
# Download only *.ppd files and ignore the Robot Exclusion Standard via /robots.txt
# and without --user-agent="" www.linuxprinting.org rejects it with "ERROR 403: Forbidden":

#   done
# Now all PPDs are in the same sub-directory "hp" (duplicates with *.ppd.1, *.ppd.2, ...).
# Remove old version PPDs (according to the file or directory-date at LinuxPrinting.org).
# Rename all PPDs to have the suffix .ppd (and not .ppd.1, .ppd.2, ...).
# Some PPDs may have MAC style cr line breaks. Recode or translate them to nl.
# Make a bzip2 compressed tar-archive of the remaining PPDs:
#   tar -cjvf hp.ppd.tar.bz2 hp/*.ppd
Source0:        hp.ppd.tar.bz2
# Howto make Source1:
# Visit http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/Oce/ and note the directory structure
# which contain PPD files - for example:
#    http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/Oce/*/1/
#    http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/Oce/Others/
# Download them (see Source0):
#   wget --user-agent="" --execute robots=off \

#        --accept "*.ppd*,*.PPD*" --directory-prefix=oce \
#        http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/PPD/Oce/
# Accept "*.ppd*" and "*.PPD*" otherwise newer vesions like "*.ppd.1" would be deleted.
# Now all PPDs are in the same sub-directory "oce".
# Newer versions of *.ppd are stored as *.ppd.1
# and some old versions of *.ppd are stored as *.PPD
# Some PPDs may have non-latin1 encoding. Recode them to lat1 (e.g.: "recode ibmpc..lat1").
# The "Others" PPDs are older versions.
# Keep only those "Others" PPDs for which there is no newer PPD.
# Make a bzip2 compressed tar-archive of them:
#   tar -cjvf oce.ppd.tar.bz2 oce/*.ppd

# Howto make Source2:
# We got the initial PPDs as attachments in mails from Jens Stark <j.stark@esbc.sharp-eu.com>.
# After unpacking them store all PPDs in the same sub-directory "sharp".
# Some of the PPDs have identical NickName entries (i.e. are for the same models)
# and identical other entries except that the default media size options are different:
# Letter for the normal PPD and A4 for a Japanese version (with a "j" somehow in the file name).
# As the default media size options are changed to A4 during build, the Japanese version is removed
# if there is another PPD with identical NickName.
# New PPDs and updates of existing PPDs are at LinuxPrinting.org.
# Download the PPDs from LinuxPrinting.org:
#   wget --user-agent="" --execute robots=off \

# Some PPDs may have non-latin1 encoding. Recode them to lat1 (e.g.: "recode ibmpc..lat1").
# Some PPDs may have CR LF line break. Remove the CR (e.g.: "tr -d '\r'").
# Copy the new PPDs into the directory "sharp".
# Check that all NickName entries are different to avoid duplicate PPDs
# (e.g. PPDs with same NickName entries but slightly different file names).
# Make a bzip2 compressed tar-archive of them:
#   tar -cjvf sharp.ppd.tar.bz2 sharp/*.ppd
Source2:        sharp.ppd.tar.bz2
# Howto make Source3:
# We got the PPDs as attachment in two mails from Vipa Nichapanich:

#   From: vipa <vipa@eitc.epson.com>
#   Date: Wed, 3 Mar 2004 11:44:14 -0800

#   Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2005 15:57:55 -0700
#   Subject: New Epson PPD Files Available for Your Linux Distribution

# as http://lx1.avasys.jp/ppd/v111/epson_ppd-1.1.1.run which must be run as root,
# then it installs PPDs into /usr/share/cups/model/epson_ppd/ where only epalc420.ppd was new.
# After unpacking them and storing all PPDs in the same sub-directory "epson":
# Add a trailing blank to "are " in the license text in epalc260.ppd to have it same in all PPDs.

# All those PPDs are in fact Ricoh PPDs (but using different printer brand names).
# The PostScript PPDs are in the sub-directory "PS",

# Almost all those PPDs require the foomatic-rip filter

# In http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/oldPPDs/ there are plain PostScript PPDs
# which do not require the foomatic-rip filter.

PPD files from printer manufacturers that are under a free license.

For example, the original MIT license, shown for example under
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php, is okay but not an
often used modified MIT license, which does not allow redistribution if
the file was altered in any way from its original form.

If you have a PostScript printer and there is no PPD file included in
this package, ask your printer manufacturer for a PPD file or visit
http://www.linuxprinting.org/ppd-doc.html.
