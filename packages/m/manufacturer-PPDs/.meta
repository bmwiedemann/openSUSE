<package name="manufacturer-PPDs" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>PPD Files from Printer Manufacturers</title>
  <description>PPD files from printer manufacturers that are under a free license.

For example, the original MIT license, shown for example under
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php, is okay but not an
often used modified MIT license, which does not allow redistribution if
the file was altered in any way from its original form.

If you have a PostScript printer and there is no PPD file included in
this package, ask your printer manufacturer for a PPD file or visit
