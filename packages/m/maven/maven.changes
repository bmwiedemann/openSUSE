Wed May  3 11:44:20 UTC 2023 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to upstream version 3.9.1
  * Changes of version 3.8.7:
    + Regression fixes from Maven 3.8.6
    + General fixes
    + Maven Wagon upgrade
  * Changes of verson 3.8.8
    + Regression fixes from Maven 3.8.7
    + General fixes
    + Non-functional backports and improvements from 3.9.0
  * Changes of version 3.9.0
    + Minimum Java version to use with Maven 3.9.0 is raised to
      Java 8.
    + With Java 8, upgrade of several key dependencies became
      possible as well.
    + Several backports from Maven 4.x line.
    + Long outstanding issue fixes from Maven 3.x line.
    + Cutting ties with Maven 2 backward compatibility, preparing
      grounds for Maven 4.
    + General fixes and improvements.
    + The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native
      HTTP”, see Resolver Transport guide.
    + Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of
      plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven
      3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility.
      Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This
      change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected
      plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on
      plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to
      add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is
      fixed by the affected plugin maintainer.
    + Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of
      RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated
      ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance
      provided by Maven instead. See MNG-7471.
    + Each line in .mvn/maven.config is now interpreted as a single
      argument. That is, if the file contains multiple arguments,
      these must now be placed on separate lines, see MNG-7684.
  * Changes of version 3.9.1:
    + Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0
    + General performance and other fixes
- Changed patches:
  * 0001-Adapt-mvn-script.patch
  * 0002-Invoke-logback-via-reflection.patch
    + rediff to changed context
  * 0004-Remove-dependency-on-powermock.patch
    -> 0003-Remove-dependency-on-powermock.patch
  * 0007-Fix-build-with-qdox-2.0.1.patch
    ->  0004-Fix-build-with-qdox-2.0.1.patch
    + rediff and rename to have the sequence of patches right
- Removed patches:
  * 0003-Use-non-shaded-HTTP-wagon.patch
  * 0005-Port-to-maven-resolver-1.7.2.patch
  * 0006-Restore-DefaultModelValidator-compatibility-with-Mav.patch
