  * disruptive change in extstore: -o ext_page_count= is deprecated
    and no longer works. To specify size: -o ext_path=/d/m/e:500G
    extstore figures out the page count based on your desired page
    size. M|G|T|P supported.

Sun Jul  8 22:57:20 UTC 2018 - alexander_naumov@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.5.9:
  * Bugfix release.
  * Important note: if using --enable-seccomp, privilege dropping
    is no longer on by default. The feature is experimental and many
    users are reporting hard to diagnose problems on varied platforms.
  * Seccomp is now marked EXPERIMENTAL, and must be explicitly
    enabled by adding -o drop_privileges. Once we're more confident
    with the usability of the feature, it will be enabled in -o modern,
    like any other new change. You should only use it if you are
    willing to carefully test it, especially if you're a vendor or
    distribution.
  * Also important is a crash fix in extstore when using the ASCII
    protocol, large items, and running low on memory.

- update to 1.4.20 
  - Fix a race condition causing new connections to appear closed,
    causing an inifinte loop.
- additional changes from 1.4.19
  - Fix endianness detection during configure.
    - Fixes a performance regression with binary protocol (up to
      20%)
  - Fix rare segfault in incr/decr.
  - disable tail_repair_time by default.
    - Likely not needed anymore, and can rarely cause bugs.

    improvement.
  - Fix crash for LRU crawler while using lock elision (haswell+
    processors)
- additional changes from 1.4.18

    - New "stats conns" command, which will show you what currently
      open connections are up to, how idle they've been, etc.
    - The jenkins hash was getting a little long in the tooth, and
      we might want to add specific hash algorithms for different
      platforms in the future. This makes it selectable in some
      sense. We've initially added murmur3 hash to the lineup and
      that seems to run a tiny bit faster in some tests. -o
      hash_algorithm=murmur3
    - A new background thread emerges! Currently experimental, so
      the syntax might change. If you run into bugs please let us
      know (though it's been testing fine in torture tests so far).

      want to be able to run a full cache flush on production
      instances.

- update to version 1.2.8:
  - make -b command actually work
  - *critical bugfix*. In 1.2.7 under multithreaded mode, memcached
    would never restart accepting connections after hitting the
    maximum connection limit.
  - remove 'stats maps' command, as it is a potential information
    leak, usable if versions prior to 1.2.8 ever have buffer
    overflows discovered. (bnc#501656) CVE-2009-1494
- additional changes from version 1.2.7
  - reset new stats with 'stats reset'
  - Slew of new tests. (misc, mostly Dustin Sallings)
  - Minor bug fixes. (misc, mostly Dustin Sallings, some Dormando)
    (see git history for full list)
  - -b command for setting the tcp listen backlog (Chris Goffinet)
  - Workaround for a more major bug that very rarely makes
    memcached stop allowing new data to be set. (Dormando)
  - Print why a key was expired in -vv mode (Dormando)
  - cmd_flush stat (Dormando)
  - listen_disabled_num stat for determining if you've hit the
    maxconns limit (Dormando)
  - Display error status on listen failures (Dormando)
  - Remove managed instance code. Incomplete/etc. (Dormando)
  - Handle broken IPV6 stacks better (Brian Aker)
  - Generate warnings on setsockopt() failures (Brian Aker)
  - Fix some indentation issues (Brian Aker)
  - UDP/TCP can be disabled by setting their port to zero (Brian
    Aker)
  - Zero out libevent thread structures before use (Ricky Zhou)
  - New stat: Last accessed time for last evicted item per slab
    class.  (Dormando)
  - Use a dedicated socket accept thread (Facebook)
  - Add -R option. Limit the number of requests processed by a
    connection at once. Prevents starving other threads if bulk
    loading. (Facebook)

Tue Dec  5 23:06:59 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 1.2.1:
  o mainly fixes a stability issue reported on the mailinglist
  o a few optimization fixes
- removed autoreconf -fi for now
- build debuginfo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 15 16:18:18 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

Sun Sep 10 12:00:00 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 1.1.13:
  o test suite (make test)
  o better libevent detection
  o 64 bit support (passes test suite at least now)
  o off-by-one errors in expirations fixed
  o bug fixes
  o start of "vbuckets" project.  instead of clients hashing
    a key onto a memcached instance, they map onto one of
    16k or so virtual bucket numbers, each bucket of which
    is owned by an instance and w/ a particular generation number.
    no client or tracker exists yet, but low-level stuff is there.
