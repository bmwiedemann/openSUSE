Tue Jul 19 17:09:17 UTC 2022 - Mihai Moldovan <ionic@ionic.de>

- Update to upstream version 2.3.0:
  * Re-show the keyboard on Wayland surrounding text changes
  * Use compose input plugin fallback only if key redirection is
    disabled
  * Remove leftover code from Qt 4 times
  * Enable installing unit tests again
  * Remove legacy unused Maemo-specific code
  * Use QLoggingCategory for logging
  * Fix application orientation angle back to clockwise
  * Add the Mir input panel window type flag
  * Use CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_* paths in pkgconfig files
  * Remove the unused and unnecessary gtk3 wayland input context
    plugin
  * Remove unused and useless install target
- Misc. whitespace- or comment-only changes.
- Modernize spec file by leaving out definition of the BuildRoot:
  tag or usage of the %defattr macro.
- Add maliit-framework-tests subpackage for packaging the
  provided unit tests.
- Remove deleted wayland-gtk wrapper.
- Add patch to fix building the test cases with GCC 12+.
- Rename libmaliit0 to libmaliit2 and, at the same time, split it
  up into libmaliit-plugins2 and libmaliit-glib2, since both
  libraries are independent from another.
- Rename maliit-framework-devel to libmaliit-devel.
- Add rpmlintrc to ignore warnings and errors we are aware of,
  but want to do on purpose (which is fine).
- Add Group: tags to packages.
- Rename dist file to %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz and add the usual
  GitHub fetching URL.
- Modify _service file to recompress to gz instead and set the
  correct file name. However, it turns out that this is really
  broken. Add a comment and fall back to manual fetching for the
  time being.
