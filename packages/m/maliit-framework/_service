    obs_scm and tar_scm are broken and fail to do what one would expect if
    given "filename" parameters.

    For obs_scm, if the provided filename does not match the URL's last
    component (minus potentially a suffix such as .git), then it:
      - clones the URL verbatim
      - does NOT change the name
      - generates filename.obsinfo and filename-$version.obscpio (this is the
        only correct thing it does)
      - then goes ahead to rename filename to filename-$version, which
        obviously won't work, because a directory called filename will not
        exist, unless the basename of the URL matches filename (which defeats
        the purpose of using the filename parameter)
      - fails to run at all.

    A workaround has been documented in
    https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/issues/384, which
    essentially is to provide a symlink from basename(URL) to filename via
    `ln -sfvn basename(URL) filename`, but this is so hacky that I won't
    employ it.

    Not passing the filename param to obs_scm but to tar instead *almost*
    works, but ultimately creates a file named filename.tar - contrary to its
    documentation, which states the resulting file name will be made up of the
    given filename parameter and its version - which, again, turns out to be
    useless.

    Hence, until this is fixed, these source services will stay broken.

    Manually fetch the distfile via the URL provided in Source0 and rename it,
    please.
