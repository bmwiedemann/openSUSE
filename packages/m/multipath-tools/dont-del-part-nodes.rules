# This system's udev rules support deletion of partition device nodes
# for disks which are members of multipath devices. That is useful
# to avoid using the member device partitions accidentally.
#
# See also 68-del-part-nodes.rules.
#
# On SUSE distributions, this feature is disabled by default, for
# backwards compatibility reasons, by means of this rule file.
# In order to enable the feature, copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.d
# and comment out the lines below.
