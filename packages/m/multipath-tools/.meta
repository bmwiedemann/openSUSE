  <title>Tools to Manage Multipathed Devices with the device-mapper</title>
  <description>This package provides the tools to manage multipathed devices by
instructing the device-mapper multipath module what to do. The tools
are:

- multipath: scans the system for multipathed devices, assembles
   them, and updates the device-mapper's maps

- multipathd: waits for maps events then execs multipath

- devmap-name: provides a meaningful device name to udev for devmaps

- kpartx: maps linear devmaps to device partitions, which makes
multipath maps partionable</description>
