# Make sure scsi device handlers are loaded before any SCSI host adapter
# drivers. This requires loading sd_mod before host adapters, which
# is ensured by the scsi_mod softdep below.
softdep sd_mod pre: scsi_dh_alua scsi_dh_rdac scsi_dh_emc

# Note that there can be only one softdep per module, and earlier
# directives take precedence. 10-scsi.conf is shipped by suse-module-tools
# in some SUSE releases; it will override the scsi_mod softdep below.
# (but it will also make sure that sd_mod is loaded early).
