  <description>
The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev may be from any MT device, specifically type A without contact tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking. See the kernel documentation for further details.
