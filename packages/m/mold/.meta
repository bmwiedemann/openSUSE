  <title>mold: A Modern Linker</title>
  <description>mold is a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers.
It is several times faster than LLVM lld linker, the second-fastest
open-source linker which I originally created a few years ago.
mold is created for increasing developer productivity by reducing
build time especially in rapid debug-edit-rebuild cycles.

Here is a performance comparison of GNU gold, LLVM lld, and mold for
linking final debuginfo-enabled executables of major large programs
on a simulated 8-core 16-threads machine.</description>
