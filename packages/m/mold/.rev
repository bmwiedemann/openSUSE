    <comment>- Start using %{_libexecdir} as an installation location.

- Remove quotationsmarks from build_args as it prevented the use
  of system packages for TBB and xxHash.
- Drop configure-fix.patch as xxHash is used from system package,
  so we don't need to patch the wrong configuration of xxHash.
- Use telling name of source tarball, adjust GitHub url to have
  matching names.

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  * make install now creates /usr/local/libexec/mold/ld as
  a symlink to the mold executable. We do this for GCC.
  By passing -B/usr/local/libexec/mold, you can tell GCC to use ld
  inside that directory instead of /usr/bin/ld. (e8dcecf)
  * xxHash library is now included in the mold's source tree as a subtree for ease of building.
    If you want to link against a libxxhash in a system library directory, pass SYSTEM_XXHASH=1 to make. (665bffa)
  * The extern &quot;C++&quot; directive is now supported in the dynamic list. (7aa5c39)
  * --color-diagnostics is supported. mold used to ignore that flag. (6e290aa)
  * Not only * but also ? are now treated as special characters in the version script wildcard pattern. (31b0248)
  * The --threads=N option has been added as
    an alias for --thread-count=N. (f9ff048)
  * The following option has been added: --defsym (f6e8006), -z nodefaultlib (8c86c28),
    -z separate-code, -z noseparate-code and -z separate-lodable-segments (5601cf4), -z max-page-size (f3766cd)
- Add workaround patch configure-fix.patch.</comment>
