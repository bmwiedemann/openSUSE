    <comment>- Start using %{_libexecdir} as an installation location.

- Remove quotationsmarks from build_args as it prevented the use
  of system packages for TBB and xxHash.
- Drop configure-fix.patch as xxHash is used from system package,
  so we don't need to patch the wrong configuration of xxHash.
- Use telling name of source tarball, adjust GitHub url to have
  matching names.

- Update to version 1.0.1:
  * make install now creates /usr/local/libexec/mold/ld as
  a symlink to the mold executable. We do this for GCC.
  By passing -B/usr/local/libexec/mold, you can tell GCC to use ld
  inside that directory instead of /usr/bin/ld. (e8dcecf)
  * xxHash library is now included in the mold's source tree as a subtree for ease of building.
    If you want to link against a libxxhash in a system library directory, pass SYSTEM_XXHASH=1 to make. (665bffa)
  * The extern &quot;C++&quot; directive is now supported in the dynamic list. (7aa5c39)
  * --color-diagnostics is supported. mold used to ignore that flag. (6e290aa)
  * Not only * but also ? are now treated as special characters in the version script wildcard pattern. (31b0248)
  * The --threads=N option has been added as
    an alias for --thread-count=N. (f9ff048)
  * The following option has been added: --defsym (f6e8006), -z nodefaultlib (8c86c28),
    -z separate-code, -z noseparate-code and -z separate-lodable-segments (5601cf4), -z max-page-size (f3766cd)
- Add workaround patch configure-fix.patch.</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Various bugs in --gdb-index have been fixed.
  * mold now recognizes --thinlto-cache-dir and --thinlto-cache-policy
    for the sake of compatibility with LLVM lld. (7ebd071)
  * mold can now handle TLS common symbols. It looks like GCC
    sometimes creates such symbol for a thread-local variable. (cf850f8)
  * In some edge cases, mold created a non-versioned symbol and
    a versioned one for the same symbol, even though if one symbol is versioned,
    all symbols of the same name must be versioned.
    This bug has been fixed. (8298c0a)
  * mold used to write a PLT address of a symbol instead
    of its address to .symtab. This bug has been fixed. (e088db7)
  * mold can now handle an input file
    with more than 219 symbols. (f1f2d40)
  * /usr/local/libexec/mold/ld is now installed
    as a relative symlink instead of an absolute symlink. (5803c3c)

    <comment>- Update to version 1.3.0
  * The --icf=safe option has been supported.
  * LTO now works reliably under a heavy load.
  mold used to abort occasionally under such condition on Linux
  due to a spurious failure of pthread_create(2). (d8a8877)
  * mold now prints out undefined symbol errors in a format similar to LLVM lld. (13816a1)
  * mold now prints out a better error message for the disk full situation. (5969260)
  * mold can now build GCC 12 with LTO. (708ad63)
  * Fixed an LTO issue on 32-bits hosts such as i686. (920266b)
  * mold is now AddressSanitizer and UndefinedSanitizer clean. (fafb75b, 3499ee6)
  * mold used to create broken debug info on 32-bits hosts (#490).
    The bug has been fixed. (0abd0a4)
  * mold used to accept not only a single dash but also double
    dashes for single-letter options. For example, --S was accidentally accepted as an alias for-S.
    This is unconventional, and such options are no longer accepted. (232dafa)
  * --color-diagnostics is now an alias for --color-diagnostics=auto
    instead of --color-diagnostics=always for compatibility with LLVM lld.
  * pkg-config is no longer needed to build mold.
  * The --package-metadata option is supported. (#505, e9f6715)</comment>

  * Initial support for the 32-bit RISC-V (RV32) has landed. (d9db6bc)
  * mold now demangles Rust symbols in error messages thanks to @eddyb's rust-demangle.c. (22e1bba)
  * --export-dynamic-symbol and --export-dynamic-symbol-list are now supported for
    the sake of compatibility with LLVM lld. With these options, you can specify
    symbols that should be exported using glob pattern. (e115aae)
  * [x86-64] PLT entries created by mold now always begins with ENDBR64 instruction
    to improve compatibility with Intel IBT (Indirect Branch Tracking.) (e3e371d)
  * mold now defines __dso_handle symbol. The lack of this linker-synthesized symbol
    caused a link error with GCC in some environments (#507). (764d757)

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.4.1
  * mold/macOS is now available as an alpha feature. We do not recommend using it for anything
    serious though. Starting from this version, we accept not only mold/Unix issues but also
    mold/macOS ones on our GitHub Issues. Feel free to file a bug if you encounter any problem.
  * We started supporting CMake in addition to Make to build mold. Our long-term plan is to migrate
    from Make to CMake because we want to support Windows eventually and CMake provides
    a better Windows support than Make does. (e6a0e67)
  * There was a bug that mold accidentally exported a hidden symbol from an executable
    if a shared library linked to that executable happened to define the same symbol.
    This caused a build issue with Blender (#606). The bug has been fixed. (b163068)
    --hash-style=both is now the default if no --hash-style option is given. Previously,
    --hash-style=sysv was the default. This change shouldn't affect most users because
    the compiler driver (cc, gcc, clang, etc.) always passes --hash-style to the linker.
    We made this change because GNU ld defaults to --hash-style=both.
  * Alias symbols defined by the --defsym option now have the same scope as the aliased symbols.
    Previously, alias symbols defined by --defsym were always hidden and never
    be exported as dynamic symbols. (5dd1227)
  * mold now accepts foo = bar-style linker script directive to define symbol aliases.
    Previously, such statement was treated as a syntax error.
    This change was made to link mariadb-connector-c correctly (f0e1237)
  * Symbols in mergeable string sections now have correct output section
    indices instead of SHN_UNDEF. (a595c48)
  * [ARM32] Previously, calling a function from ARM code to Thumb code
    caused a program crash due to bug #442. This issue has been fixed. (053b90b)

  * [RV32] We've fixed several issues for 32-bit RISC-V.
    mold can now build complex programs including itself for the target.
  * [ARM32] mold gained range extension thunks so that it can now link programs whose
    .text is larger than 16 MiB. Previously, mold couldn't link such large programs.
    We've also fixed general stability issues for ARM32.</comment>

    <time>1664302446</time>
    <user>RBrownFactory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.5.0
  * PPC64LE and SPARC64 are now supported as new targets. They haven't yet been as
    well tested as other targets, but they are already able to link mold itself on
    these platforms. (Note that PPC64LE is very unlikely to work on the most recent
    POWER10 machines as we didn't have a chance to test it due to a limited
    availability (POWER10 was released in 2021). If you can support us on this
    matter, please contact us. We also accept donations, so please consider
    supporting our project!)
  * RV32BE and RV64BE (32-bit and 64-bit big-endian RISC-V) are now supported as
    experimental targets. RISC-V is usually little-endian, but there exists a
    big-endian RISC-V as an extension. You can make gcc to emit code for big-endian
    RISC-V by passing -mbig-endian. mold can now link object files generated with
    that option.
  * --compress-debug-sections=zstd is now supported. This is an option to compress
    debug info embedded to an output file with Zstandard compression algorithm.
    Compared to the existing --compress-debug-sections=zlib, zstd is faster and
    gives a higher compression ratio. You probably can't start using zstd
    compression today though, because other tools such as gdb may not be able to
    read zstd-compressed debug info yet. But adding this option early makes mold
    future-proof. (ede7a5a)
  * mold no longer aligns loadable segments to page boundaries to reduce output file
    size. Previously, we allocated holes between loadable segments. The saving by
    this change is most visible for small programs. For example, a &quot;hello world&quot;
    program used to be ~18 KiB on x86-64. It's now 7.2 KiB. (2941d75)
  * Bug fixes and compatibility improvements
  * [RISCV] We optimized code so that the link speed for RISC-V is now comparable to
    the other targets. As an example, linking mold itself (~150 MiB in size) for
    RV64 used to take ~45 seconds on a simulated 16-core machine. It now takes only
    ~0.25 seconds. (3ab5489)
  * mold used to create more than one .rodata section under a certain condition.</comment>

    <user>RBrownFactory</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.5.1
  * We changed the memory layout to save both memory and disk space in 1.5.0. Even
    though the new layout works fine on most systems, the change made the linker to
    create unusable executables for systems with large pages. Specifically, if you
    specify a large number for the -z max-page-size option, the loader refused to
    execute it with the error while loading shared libraries: cannot apply
    additional memory protection after relocation: Cannot allocate memory error. We
    reverted our recent commits so that mold creates output files with the same
    memory layout as it did before 1.5.0. (e62de0b)</comment>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 1.6.0
  * [ppc64] mold now supports the original 64-bit big-endian PowerPC ABI (which is
    also known as PPC64 ELFv1 or just ppc64), so that you can build applications for
    older PPC64 systems with mold. Note that this should not be confused with the
    modern PPC64 ELFv2 ABI (which is also known as ppc64le), which is already
    supported by mold.
  * [s390x] Linux/s390x is now supported. Linux/s390x is the Linux environment
    running on IBM z/Architecture mainframes. I've personally never seen a
    mainframe, but we wanted to support it because many Linux distros actively
    support that target, which in turn means there are many enterprise users who are
    using IBM mainframes. Speaking of the porting effort, we do not only port our
    linker to s390x but also found a couple of issues with the existing GCC
    toolchain for s390x. So, we are improving the whole IBM mainframe ecosystem!
  * mold now creates smaller output files. It is most noticeable on targets with
    large page sizes such as PPC64 (on which the common page size is 64 KiB), but
    even on x86-64, it should save a few kilobytes per an output file.
  * [arm64] mold can now link executables with -static-pie. Previously, executables
    linked with that flag crashed immediately.
- Exclude ppc architecture as it is not supported right now.</comment>

  * [m68k] mold now supports the Motorola 68000 series microprocessors. Yes, it's
    the processor in the original Mac or Sun workstations in the 80s. This work is
    sponsored by m68k hobbyist communities.
  * We fixed a few issues for Facebook/Meta's BOLT optimizer (#789). Starting from
    the next LLVM release (we need llvm/llvm-project@20204db), BOLT should work on
    mold-generated executables out of the box.
  * We fixed a long-standing symbol resolution issue involving GNU UNIQUE symbols
    which caused a link failure for a few programs. (730e970)
  * Previously, if a version script contains a &quot;C++&quot; directive, and a symbol matches
    a non-C++ version pattern and a C++ version pattern, a wrong version could be
    assigned to the symbol. This has been fixed so that the mold's behavior matches
    with GNU ld. (9875150)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to version 1.8.0
  * The --relocatable (or -r) option has been reimplemented to improve its
    performance and compatibility with the GNU linkers. That option tells the linker
    to combine input object files into another object file instead of into an
    executable or a shared library file. mold has been supporting the feature since
    version 0.9, but until now the output file created with -r looked fairly
    different from what GNU linkers would produce. GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) in
    particular uses re-linkable object files as dynamic libraries instead of real
    .so files, and it didn't work with mold. Now, mold can produce object files that

  * --relocatable-merge-sections option has been added. By default, mold keeps
    original input section names for the --relocatable output and therefore does not
    merge input sections into a single output sections unless they are of the same
    name. If --relocatable-merge-sections is given, mold merges input by the usual

    if and only if --relocatable-merge-sections is given for the --relocatable
    output. (c2a0ae1)

    This change was made so that it is easy to find a typo in a version script.

  * mold now warns on symbol type mismatch. If two object files have the same symbol
    with different symbol types, it usually means your program has a bug. Chances
    are, you are using the same identifier as a function name in one translation
