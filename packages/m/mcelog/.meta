  <title>Log Machine Check Events</title>
  <description>mcelog retrieves machine check events from an x86-64 kernel in a cron
job, decodes them, and logs them to /var/log/mcelog.

A machine check event is a hardware error detected by the CPU.

It should run on any x86-64 system.

In addition, it allows decoding machine check kernel panic messages.</description>
