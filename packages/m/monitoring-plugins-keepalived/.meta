  <title>Check keepalived</title>
  <description>This script uses the 'notify' functionality of keepalived to:
* execute a script on changes during keepalived runtime, which writes
  the state change into a temporary file
* read the file each time the monitoring server asks for the state if
  there is a keepalived up and running
