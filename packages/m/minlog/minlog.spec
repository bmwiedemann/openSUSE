%description
MinLog is a Java logging library. Key features:

* Zero overhead Logging statements below a given level
  can be automatically removed by javac at compile time.
  This means applications can have detailed trace and
  debug logging without having any impact on the finished product.

* Simple and efficient The API is concise and the code
  is very efficient at run-time.

* Extremely lightweight The entire project consists of a single
  Java file with ~100 non-comment lines of code.
