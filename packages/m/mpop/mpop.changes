  - Added a new configuration command 'eval' to replace the current configuration
    file line with the output of a command (similar to passwordeval, but more
    general).

- update to 1.4.16:
  * No significant changes.
  * Added mpopd, a minimal POP3 server that delivers mails from a local mailbox
    in maildir format. It can be used by end users as a way to handle incoming
    mail via mpop with mail clients that insist on using POP3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  4 15:35:44 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.12
  - Gnulib update to 2007-11-27.
  - Don't count already retrieved messages twice. This fixes a
    segfault when only_new is off and header or size filtering is
    on. The bug was introduced in the previous change; no released
    version is affected.
  - If a filter decides to delete a mail, then additionally mark it
    as retrieved. This prevents to filter the mail again in a later
    session when the 'keep' option is set.
  - Fix default UIDLS file on the W32 platform: Use '\' as
    directory separator, not '/'. Reported by Ricky Thomas.
- additional changes from 1.0.11
  - Update the license of the source code to GPLv3 or later, and
    change the license of the documentation to the GFDLv1.2 or
    later.
  - Gnulib update to 2007-07-15.
  - Add new option -Q / --half-quiet to print only status
    information but no progress information. Suggested by Dimitrios
    Apostolou.
  - Set the default timeout to 180 seconds = 3 minutes. This
    prevents sessions from hanging forever. Suggested by Dimitrios
    Apostolou.
  - Make the POP3 commands UIDL, LIST, and DELE abortable. This is
    useful for mailboxes with many thousand mails.
  - Update the UIDL state after mail retrieval, and save this state
    in case of errors in DELE or QUIT. Only update the UIDL state
    again after successful DELE and QUIT, and then save this state.
    This prevents an incorrect UIDL state if the DELE commands are
    aborted, for example. Bug reported by Dimitrios Apostolou.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  7 17:29:14 CEST 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.10
  - Fix UIDL handling: the first character of UIDs was ignored.
  - Improve APOP timestamp checks. Thanks to Carlos Martín Nieto
    for a discussion of this.
  - Add documentation on how to find the right CA certificate for
    tls_trust_file. Thanks to Bryan Kam for suggestions.
  - Improve the documentation for TLS vs. SSL and STARTTLS vs.
    POP3-over-TLS.  Thanks to Carlos Martín Nieto for suggestions.
  - Update the spanish translation (Carlos Martín Nieto).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 05:09:42 CEST 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.9
  - Security fix:
    - APOP authentication is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
      attacks.  See CVE-2007-1558. Such attacks might lead to
      password disclosure.  Therefore, mpop does not use APOP
      automatically without TLS anymore.  Additionally, mpop's
      checks on the APOP challenge were too lax in previous
      versions, making attacks easier than necessary. This has been
      fixed.
  - Security improvements:
    - NTLM authentication is considered insecure because it is
      undocumented. It is therefore not used automatically without
      TLS anymore.
    - TLS requires tls_trust_file or a disabled tls_certcheck now,
      so that it is not silently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
      attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 26 22:44:11 CEST 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.8
  - Improved workarounds for POP3 servers that are not exactly RFC
    conformant.  For example, pipelining is now enabled
    automatically for pop.gmail.com and some other servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 30 18:36:50 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.7
  - Add a workaround for the Comcast.net POP3 server: allow more
    than one space before the UID in an UIDL response, even though
    RFC 1939 says it must be exactly one.
    Reported and fixed by Benji Fisher.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 22:14:47 CET 2007 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.6
  - Updated copyright info to 2007.
  - Added an "auto" setting for pipelining and made it the default.
    "on" and "off" now force pipelining on or off regardless of
    server capabilities.  Thanks to Jeremy C. Reed for suggestions
    on this.
  - Gnulib update to 2007-01-10.
  - Switch to autoconf-2.61 and automake-1.10, to avoid problems
    with configure trying to run "sh /usr/bin/install" where
    /usr/bin/install is not a shell script on NetBSD.
    Reported by Jeremy C. Reed.
  - Put the POP3_PIPELINE_MIN and POP3_PIPELINE_MAX definitions
    into #ifndef ...  #endif so that they can easily be set via
    CFLAGS. Thanks to Jeremy C. Reed for the patch.
  - Remove the obsolete "extern int errno;" declaration. It does
    not conform to POSIX and causes trouble.
    Thanks to Jeremy C. Reed for the patch.
  - Added AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to configure.ac, for large file support.
    Removed the unnecessary AC_C_CONST and AC_HEADER_STDC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  6 18:16:42 CET 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.0.5:
  Some minor build problems were fixed, and the gnulib portability
  library was updated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 29 02:13:26 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de

- Update to version 1.0.3:
  * Improved configuration file examples in the documentation.
  * Fix GNU SASL support: replace #ifdef HAVE_GSASL with
    #ifdef HAVE_LIBGSASL.  The old code did not actually use GNU
    SASL. This bug was introduced in 1.0.2.
  * Prevent to write UIDLs files that we cannot read back.
  * Do not allow UIDs to start with a space.
  * Allow UIDLs file lines to be long enough to hold the longest
    UID that we would accept from a server.
  * Added spanish translation by Carlos Martín Nieto. Thanks a lot!
  * Correct the documentation of "~/.mpop_uidls" in mpop.1 and
    mpop.texi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 21 04:44:36 CEST 2006 - mrueckert@suse.de
