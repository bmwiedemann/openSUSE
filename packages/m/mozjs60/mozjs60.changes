- Drop python-wheel BuildRequires: causes a build cycle, and is not
  needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 29 08:48:14 UTC 2019 - Bj√∏rn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- No longer pass --enable-debug to configure. It is not needed for
  our endusers, and will only slow down the engine. Nor have we
  built it with debug in the past.

- Initial package (based on mozjs52), version 60.1.0:
  * New syntax:
    - `for await (... of ...)` syntax is used for async iteration;
    - The rest operator is now supported in object destructuring:
      e.g. `({a, b, ...cd} = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4});`;
    - The spread operator is now supported in object literals: e.g.
      `mergedObject = {...obj1, ...obj2};`;
    - Generator methods can now be async, using the `async
      function*` syntax, or `async* f() {...}` method shorthand;
    - It's now allowed to omit the variable binding from a catch
      statement, if you don't need to access the thrown exception:
      `try {...} catch {}`.
  * New APIs:
    - Promise.prototype.finally(), popular in many third-party
      Promise libraries, is now available natively;
    - String.prototype.toLocaleLowerCase() and
      String.prototype.toLocaleUpperCase() now take an optional
      locale or array of locales;
    - Intl.PluralRules is now available;
    - Intl.NumberFormat.protoype.formatToParts() is now available;
    - Intl.Collator now has a caseFirst option;
    - Intl.DateTimeFormat now has an hourCycle option.
  * New behaviour: There are a lot of minor behaviour changes as
    SpiderMonkey's JS implementation conforms ever closer to
    ECMAScript standards.
  * Backwards-incompatible changes:
    - Conditional catch clauses have been removed, as they were a
      Mozilla extension which will not be standardized;
    - The nonstandard `for each (... in ...)` loop was removed;
    - The nonstandard legacy lambda syntax (`function(x) x*x`) was
      removed;
    - The nonstandard Mozilla iteration protocol was removed, as
      well as nonstandard Mozilla generators, including the
      Iterator and StopIteration objects, and the
      Function.prototype.isGenerator() method.
    - Array comprehensions and generator comprehensions have been
      removed.
    - Several nonstandard methods were removed: ArrayBuffer.slice()
      (but not the standard version, ArrayBuffer.prototype.\
      slice()), Date.prototype.toLocaleFormat(), Function.\
      prototype.isGenerator(), Object.prototype.watch(), and
      Object.prototype.unwatch().
- Drop bmo1176787.patch inherited from mozjs52: fixed upstream.
- Add patches:
  mozjs60-fix-memory-leak-in-LCovCompartment-esr60.patch
  (bmo#1478679) and
  mozjs60-prevent-an-internal-gcc-8_0_1-error.patch
  (bmo#1458382).
