  <title>MJPEG Video Capture and Processing Tools</title>
  <description>The mjpegtools allow for capture, playback, processing, and simple
editing of MJPEG AV data. The hardware I/O applications are intended
for use with Zoran MJPEG framegrabber-based hardware (see the
zoran-driver package), but the processing tools can be used with MJPEG
data from other sources as well.</description>
