Thu Dec  8 06:21:44 UTC 2022 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Rebased javac-check.patch to new build.xml.

- Changed ant target from "dist" to "build", as it's been renamed.

- As Oracle renamed the package to "mysql-connector-j", we are
  "providing" both names for now, but the package has to be renamed
  to accommodate the change because the old name will be deprecated
  at some point in the future without further notice.

- Update to 8.0.31:
  Functionality Added or Changed
    * Important Change: To comply with proper naming guidelines, the
      Maven groupId and artifactId for Connector/J have been changed
      to the following starting with this release:
        groupId: com.mysql
        artifactId: mysql-connector-j

    * The old groupId and artifactId can still be used for linking 
      the Connector/J library, but they will point to a Maven 
      relocation POM, redirecting users to the new coordinates. 
      Please switch to the new coordinates as soon as possible, as 
      the old coordinates could be discontinued anytime without 
      notice. See Installing Connector/J Using Maven.

    * Also, to go with these changes, the .jar library for 
      Connector/J has been renamed to mysql-connector-j-x.y.z for 
      all channels of distribution by Oracle, not just the Maven 
      repository.

    * Before release 8.0.29, Connector/J always interpolated byte
      arrays as hexadecimal literals when obtaining a prepared 
      statement's string representation by the toString() method. 
      Since 8.0.29, all byte array values were displayed as 
      ** BYTE ARRAY DATA ** when converted to strings. The same is 
      also true for null values.

    * To allow different ways to display byte array data and null 
      values, a new connection property, maxByteArrayAsHex, has been
      introduced: byte arrays shorter than the value of 
      maxByteArrayAsHex are now shown as hexadecimal literals like
      before release 8.0.29. Any byte arrays longer than this value
      are interpolated generically as ** BYTE ARRAY DATA **.

  Bugs Fixed
    * X DevAPI: When parsing a string into a JSON string, some 
      escape character sequences were not parsed properly, causing 
      the Server to throw a com.mysql.cj.exceptions.WrongArgumentException 
      when receiving the JSON value. This fix ensures that escape 
      sequences are handled properly.

    * X DevAPI: When using the modify() method on JSON documents, 
      any backslashes inside a literal to be used for the modification 
      were lost. This fix corrects the mistakes in the expression 
      parser that caused the issue.

    * Executing a PreparedStatment after applying setFetchSize(0) on
      it caused an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

    * Due to some old limitations, when used with Java applets, 
      Connector/J found out the default character set on a system by
      various workarounds like reading the system property 
      file.encoding, using an OutpuStreamWriter, etc. With this fix,
      Connector/J now uses Charset.defaultCharset(), the standard
      method for the purpose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  1 10:44:23 UTC 2022 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.30:
  Functionality Added or Changed
    * X DevAPI: For document-modifying methods that are chained 
      after modify() and take a document path expression as one of
      its arguments (that is, set(), unset(), arrayInsert(),
      arrayAppend()), Connector/J now throws an error when the
      document path is empty or is a null string.
  Bugs Fixed
    * Historically, MySQL Server has used utf8 as an alias for 
      utf8mb3. Since release 8.0.29, utf8mb3 has become a recognized
      (though deprecated) character set on its own for MySQL Server
      and to make things consistent, in release 8.0.30, any 
      collations prefixed with utf8_ are now prefixed with utf8mb3_ 
      instead. To go with that change, Connector/J has updated its
      character set and collation mapping accordingly in this
      release, and users are encouraged to update to Connector/J 
      8.0.30 to avoid potential issues when working with MySQL 
      Server 8.0.30 or later.
    * A few links in the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the distribution
      packages were broken. They have now been fixed or removed.
    * The description for the connection property
      rewriteBatchedStatements has been corrected, removing the
      limitation that server-sided prepared statements could not
      take advantage of the rewrite option.
    * A spelling error has been fixed in the source file for the
      PropertyDefinitions class. Thanks to Weijie Wu for 
      contributing the fix.
    * DatabaseMetaData.getTypeInfo always returned false for
      AUTO_INCREMENT for all data types. With this fix, Connector/J
      returns the correct value for each data type. Also, the
      missing types DOUBLE UNSIGNED and DOUBLE PRECISION UNSIGNED
      have been added to the ResultSet.
    * Contrary to the the MySQL requirement for comments, 
      Connector/J did not require a whitespace (or a control
      character such as a newline) after "--" to mark the beginning
      of a comment within a SQL statement. This fix aligns
      Connector/J with the MySQL requirement.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 28 09:47:16 UTC 2022 - David Anes <david.anes@suse.com>

- Update to 8.0.29: 
  Functionality added or changed:
    * Historically, MySQL has used utf8 as an alias for utf8mb3. 
      Since release 8.0.29, utf8mb3 has become a recognized (though 
      deprecated) character set on its own for MySQL Server. 
      Therefore, Connector/J has added utf8mb3 to its character set 
      mapping, and users are encouraged to update to 
      Connector/J 8.0.29 to avoid potential issues when working with 
      MySQL Server 8.0.29 or later. (Bug #33850155)
    * A new connection property socksProxyRemoteDns has been added, 
      which, when set to true, makes the SocksProxySocketFactory 
      execute its own connect() implementation that passes the 
      unresolved InetSocketAddress of a MySQL Server host to the 
      created proxy socket, instead of having the address resolved 
      locally. (Bug #77924, Bug #25710160)
    * The code for prepared statements has been refactored to make 
      the code simpler and the logic for binding more consistent 
      between ServerPreparedStatement and ClientPreparedStatement.
    * Connector/J now supports Fast Identity Online (FIDO) 
      Authentication. See Connecting Using Fast Identity Online 
      (FIDO) Authentication for details. 
  Bugs fixed:
    * X DevAPI: If the connection property xdevapi.ssl-mode was set
      to DISABLED (or xdevapi.ssl-mode was not set, but the value 
      was picked up from the sslMode setting), specifying some of 
      the security properties caused Connector/J to throw an error. 
      With this fix, even when encryption is turned off and 
      irrelevant security properties are set, Connector/J does not 
      throw an error.
    * DatabaseMetaData.getDefaultTransactionIsolation() returned a 
      wrong value. It now returns the correct value of 
      Connection.TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ. (Bug #33723611)
    * Statement executions failed for replication connections when 
      useCursorFetch was true and defaultFetchSize was greater than 
      0. (Bug #25701740)
    * Prepared statements were parsed incorrectly sometimes when 
      they contained comments marked by /* and */. (Bug #21978230)
    * A connection did not maintain the correct autocommit state 
      when it was used in a pool with useLocalSessionState=true. 
      (Bug #106435, Bug #33850099)
    * References: This issue is a regression of: Bug #33054827.
    * A spelling error in the error message for the buffer length 
      being less than the expected payload length has been corrected. 
      Thanks to Jianjian Song for contributing the fix. 
      (Bug #106397, Bug #33893591)
    * When using client-side prepared statements, if the VALUES 
      clause came after the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause or it 
      came at the end of the statement, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException 
      was thrown. This patch refactors the query parser to fix the 
      problem behind the issue, and also to improve the parser's 
      performance. (Bug #106240, Bug #33781440)
    * An unnecessary boxing has been removed from findColumn() in 
      the ResultSetImpl class. Thanks to Pei Pei Ning for 
      contributing this improvement. (Bug #106171, Bug #33757217)
    * When decoding decimals, the constructor used for creating the 
      BigDecimal object has been changed from BigDecimal(String) to 
      BigDecimal(char[]) in order to save memory. Thanks to Chen Yi 
      for contributing to this improvement. 
      (Bug #106065, Bug #33726184)
    * When inserting BigDecimal values into a database using 
      rewritable server-side prepared statements with cursor-based 
      fetching, the values suffered precision loss. (Bug #105915, 
      Bug #33678490)
    * When the Connector/J logger level was at TRACE, a null bind 
      value for a PreparedStatement resulted in a NullPointerException
      when the logger tried to read the value. This patch added a 
      null check to avoid the exception to be thrown under the 
      situation. (Bug #104349, Bug #33563548)
    * When the connection property rewriteBatchedStatements was set 
      to true, inserting a BLOB using a prepared statement and 
      executeBatch() resulted in a NullPointerException. 
      (Bug #85317, Bug #25672958)
    * ResultSetMetaData and DatabaseMetaData returned Types.DATE for 
      a YEAR table column even when yearIsDateType=false. With this 
      fix, Types.SMALLINT was returned correctly in the situation. 
      (Bug #82084, Bug #23743938)
    * A PreparedStatement could not be rewritten for batch insert if 
      any table column involved contained "select" as a substring in 
      the column name. (Bug #81468, Bug #23312764)
    * When using server-side prepared statements and the connection 
      property profileSQL was set to true, setting a parameter of 
      type LONGTEXT using a StringReader() resulted in a j
      ava.io.NotSerializableException. (Bug #62006, Bug #16714956)
    * Data truncation occurred for INOUT type parameters of data 
      type BIT(1) for stored procedures. (Bug #38954, Bug #11749415)
