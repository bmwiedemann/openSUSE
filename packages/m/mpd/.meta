  <title>Music Player Daemon</title>
  <description>A daemon for playing music (mp3, ogg vorbis, flac, and wav).  Music is
played through the server's audio device.  The daemon stores info
about all available music, and this info can be easily searched and
retrieved.  Player control, info retrieval, and playlist management
can all be managed remotely. There a bunch of clients to control mpd:
for Gnome, KDE, console and Apache (PHP).

Please read README.mpd how to configure it.
