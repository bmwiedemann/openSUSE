- This package is meant as an alternative lightweight replacement
  for man-pages package. It does not have that many dependencies,
  it is written in C, see http://mandoc.bsd.lv/ for more.
- Update to the 1.14.5 release proper:
  * The apropos(1) utility now accepts case-insensitive extended
    regular expressions by default, improving POSIX compliance
    (thanks to Wolfram Schneider for the suggestion).
  * The new man(1) -O tag[=term] output option opens a page at the
    definition of a term (thanks to Klemens Nanni for the suggestion).
  * The output from tbl(7) has been significantly improved in both
    the HTML and the UTF-8 output modes (thanks to Pali Rohar for
    many reports and suggestions).
  * Several syntax errors have been fixed in HTML output and the
    HTML output code quality has been further improved, in particular
    with respect to paragraphs, tagged lists, and tooltips
    (thanks to John Gardner for significant help).
  * Low-level roff(7) support has been further improved such that
    mandoc can now handle the manual pages of the groff package.
  * Many bugs have been fixed.
