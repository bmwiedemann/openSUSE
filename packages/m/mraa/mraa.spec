%description
libmraa is a C/C++ library with bindings to Java, Python and JavaScript to
interface with the IO on Galileo, Edison & other platforms, with a
structured and sane API where port names/numbering matches the board that
you are on. Use of libmraa does not tie you to specific hardware with board
detection done at runtime you can create portable code that will work
across the supported platforms.

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to
map their sensors & actuators on top of supported hardware and to allow
control of low level communication protocol by high level languages &
constructs.
