- Add mayavi-pr1290-vtk-9.3.patch for VTK 9.3
  * gh#enthought/mayavi#1290

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 21 04:02:30 UTC 2023 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Add patch python-311-support.patch:
  * Avoid an interpreter segfault.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 22 19:22:02 UTC 2022 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.8.1
  * This is a bugfix release to work correctly with VTK-9.2.2 and
    also resolve pep517 related issues. 3 PRs were merged.
  * Add a pyproject.toml.
  * BUG: Work around 9.2.2 bug
  * Adds a `VTK_PARSER_VERBOSE` env var that can be set to `1` or
    `true` to get it to print instantiations/methods as they are
    tried.
  * Adds a `TVTK_VERBOSE` env var that enables printing during the
    TVTK tests (which were segfaulting at one point).
  * Update protein.py to work correctly.
- Mayavi 4.8.0
  * This release introduces a few useful new features and fixes
    some bugs. The primary feature is the addition of support for
    an itkwidgets_ backend for jupyter notebook support using
    entirely client-side rendering. This version also makes it
    possible to build and install Mayavi on headless servers.
  ## Enhancements
  * Refactor jupyter backends and add support for using
    itkwidgets_. This allows us to use Mayavi in a headless manner
    unlike the other backends which require offscreen support.
  * Also issues with the test backend which is used for the new
    ``'itk'`` backend.
  ## Fixes
  * Support VTK_LONG_LONG and VTK_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG array handler.
  * Fix bug with cell_to_point_data filter.
  * Fix headless build
    - Ensure that tests can run when toolkit is null.
    - Do not generate docs on build as this will fail on headless
      servers.
  * Use raw strings for generated docstrings
- No X server for install anymore
- Remove doc packages
- Remove examples and integrationtests from installed sitearch
- Enable (headless, 64bit-only) test suite with pytest
- Merge python3-tvtk into main package. It does not have its own
  metadata and is not on PyPI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 26 18:19:45 UTC 2021 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 4.7.4:
  This is primarily a bugfix release that resolves issues with
  VTK-9.0.3 and VTK-9.1.x compatibility. CI now uses GitHub Actions
  and a few other minor bugs have been fixed. `mlab` imports may be
  a little faster thanks to some cleanup.
- Release note for 4.7.3:
  This is a small bug fix release mainly concerned with
  compatability with Traits 6.2.0 and soon to be release TraitsUI
  7.2.0.
- Streamline python cache compilation and deduplication

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 11 03:42:14 UTC 2021 - Steve Kowalik <steven.kowalik@suse.com>

- Remove unneeded BuildRequires on python3-nose. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 23 12:46:20 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 4.7.2:
  The significant update for this release is that it is compatible with the
  latest VTK-9.x series and is known to work with VTK 9.0.1 from PyPI. The
  picker UI has changed to no longer pop up a UI window but instead show the
  picked attributes on the render window directly. The original picker UI is now
  available on the scene's UI in a separate "Picker" tab. This is accessible
  from either the pipeline view when one edits the properties of a scene or
  through the "configure scene" gear icon on the scene window toolbar.
  a few dozen bugfixes, see included changes
- drop no_vtk_require.patch (obsolete)

Fri Sep 13 14:50:46 UTC 2019 - Todd R <toddrme2178@gmail.com>

- Update to Mayavi 4.7.1
  + Fixes
   * Fix old pipeline errors in image actor.
   * Use the decorator for classmethod
     Instead of explicitly calling it in the class definition
   * Misc bug fixes
     Fixes 3 issues that affect the new release due to changes in traits, pyface etc.
     > Fix issue with CTF editor not showing.
     > Fix issue with lut editor not launching.
     > Fix issue with cut/pasting tree nodes and drag drop onto shell.
- Update to Mayavi 4.7.0
  + Enhancements
   * New Jupyter notebook 'ipy' backend which is now the default and
     requires that VTK's offscreen support work correctly. This backend
     requires ipywidgets and ipyevents. It allows complete interactivity and
     behaves almost exactly like a normal UI backend but inside a notebook.
     Note that this will still require an xserver or windowing toolkit unless
     VTK is compiled to be able to work without those.
   * Improve offscreen window creation.
     Creating a renderwindow in some configurations can actually make UI
     calls.  So if EGL is available we try that.  Also, when we are using
     offscreen rendering we only need a GenericRenderWindowInteractor.
     Also add a convenient set method so one can set a different interactor if needed.
   * ENH: Feature to disable automatic updates.
     This can be very handy at times when the automatic updates can trigger
     several changes that are not desirable.  For example on certain VTK
     calls, internal ModifiedEvents may be fired which will automatically
     call the update_traits method which can be wired to other events
     triggering problems.  In these cases one can use the
     `global_disable_update` function to temporarily disable updates.
  + Fixes
   * Test against ETS packages from source using travis cron jobs.
   * Use xenial linux instead of trusty
   * add fix for str conversion from bad bytes array
   * Fix issue that arises in a few of the mlab sources where when we reset to a
     polydata with a smaller number of points.
   * FIX: Fix nose leftovers in tests.
   * FIX: Escape chars in code.
   * Also catch exceptions in generating documentation
   * Some UI fixes for ivtk.
     This fixes `#734 <https://github.com/enthought/mayavi/issues/734>`_.
   * FIX: Fix set_range causing lookup table errors.
   * FIX: Fix type check
   * FIX: Fix for VTKNoneArray
   * If OSMesa is available and user requests an offscreen window, use an
     OSOpenGLRenderWindow, this will not require X and can be safely used on
     a remote server.
   * Fix bug related to SurfaceSource.scalars This bug manifests when the
     SurfaceSource object in question does not have a scalars attribute and
     many of them do not have this.
   * Fix pip installs failing.
   * Fix detection of color transfer function.
     The original code was written for very old VTK versions but ever since
     5.x we have a get_node_value method that actually provides the values of
     the nodes given an index.  We now use this instead of the earlier hack.
