- Update to 1.0.0:
  Ooops, we've run out of minor versions
  - The only significant addition to this release is the "raise"
    command that can be used to make players pop up after being
    minimized or hidden.
- Update to 0.9.100:
  Shuffle boogie
  - The shuffle command was broken for a while in some builds
    (maybe even from the start?), resulting in a crash from
    inside the DBUS library. We fixed it, and shuffle can safely
    be used again.
- Update to 0.9.99.1:
  Absolute unit of a volume
  - This release only contains a fix for parsing absolute volumes
    from the command arguments.
- Update to 0.9.99:
  Pipe up
  - Added a new command for getting and setting the volume.
  - Added formatting for time properties.
- Update to 0.9.98:
  Still seeking the best in others
  - Fixed an issue with parsing negative seek times.
- Update to 0.9.96:
  The final countdown (take 2)
  - Added commands to change shuffle and repeat modes.
  - Improved how we're showing the metadata values that are
    string arrays (like artist, and album artist).
  - Fixed a double free for a dbus reply on seek method.
- Update to 0.9.95:
  The final countdown (take 1)
  - Added commands to change shuffle and repeat modes.
  - Improved how we're showing the metadata values that are
    string arrays (like artist, and album artist).
- Update to 0.9:
  The "Those who seek, will find"
  - Add "seek" command capable of back or forward seeking into
    current track.
  - Improve active/inactive/named player selection for commands.
  - Improve documentation.
- Update to 0.8.6:
  The "Backstreet's back all right"
  - Fix a crash when loading player names from the --player flag.
  - Many thanx and apologies to github users vaygr and JosefLitos
    for their bug reports and reminders.

- update to 0.8.5:
  * Fixing some issues with copying strings (that's what I get for using C)
  * Improving buffer sizes, because sometimes the comments can be quite
    large
  * Changed default from effecting commands to all existing players to only
    active ones.
  * Now it requires explicit setting the falg --player inactive to do it for
    inactive ones.
