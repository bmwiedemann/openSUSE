- update to 0.8.5:
  * Fixing some issues with copying strings (that's what I get for using C)
  * Improving buffer sizes, because sometimes the comments can be quite
    large
  * Changed default from effecting commands to all existing players to only
    active ones.
  * Now it requires explicit setting the falg --player inactive to do it for
    inactive ones.
