   devices without decompression.
  * Indexed images are no longer uncompressed at load time, saving
    memory.
  * Caching of rendered tiles for speed.
  * Improved text analysis mode, capable of spotting
    columns/indents, right-to-left text etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 16 21:51:03 UTC 2013 - gber@opensuse.org

- update to version 1.1
  - The command line tools have been combined into one tool that
    does all: mubusy
  - Rendering bugs fixed (text clipping, stroked text etc).
  - Better handling of 'large' (uncachable) glyphs.
  - Minor speed optimisations.
  - Shading bug fixes.
  - Move to using dynamically allocated parsing buffers (more
    resilient).
  - Support for UserUnits.
  - Fix bugs with image predictors (including with 16 bit images).
  - More resilient to out of spec files.
  - Extract pdf writing capability into the library from pdfclean,
    and expand on it to allow for linearisation. Bug fixes in the
    garbage collection of unused objects.
  - Improve pdf writing recognition of images.
  - Improved font matching.
  - Start to move away from macros to inline functions (helpful for
    applications requiring certification).
  - Many bugs fixed.
  - Removal of all global variables: we now pass a context pointer
    through the code freeing us from the use of globals within the
    library.
  - Multi-threaded operation: while MuPDF does not require a thread
    library, hooks are in place so that if one is used, significant
    speedups can be gained from using multiple cores to render.
  - New error handling: a portable exception-like system is used to
    allow neater handling of errors. This leads to more stability
    and better resilience to broken files.
  - Public/Private API: the API has undergone a significant
    revision (required by some of the above changes, plus
    renaming/revising for clarity and consistency), and has been
    split into public and private headers. The plan is that the
    public portion of the API should remain much more static in
    future.
  - Improved Text Extraction device: a cleaner API to the
    experimental text extraction device, offering a list of styles,
    and more cleanly delineated content.
  - Documentation: All public header entry points/structures are
    now documented and overviews of how to call the library to
    render pages both in single and multi-threaded mode are given.
  - A new scavenging memory manager; makes much better use of the
    memory available by freeing cached items 'just in time'.
  - Many, many, bugfixes.
- removed obsolete mupdf-use-xdg-open.patch and
  mupdf-default-resolution.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  8 14:31:24 UTC 2012 - gber@opensuse.org

- added mupdf-default-resolution.patch in order to change the
  default resolution to 96 DPI which should be more reasonable for
  most desktops

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 18:03:34 UTC 2011 - gber@opensuse.org

- hide from menu since mupdf must be called with a filename
- added mupdf-use-xdg-open.patch in order to use xdg-open for
  launching a browser
