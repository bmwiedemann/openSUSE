- update to 2.0.18 (bsc#1214918, CVE-2023-28366, bsc#1215865,
                    CVE-2023-0809, bsc#1215864, CVE-2023-3592):
  * Fix crash on subscribe under certain unlikely conditions.
  * Fix mosquitto_rr not honouring `-R`. Closes #2893.
  * Fix `max_queued_messages 0` stopping clients from receiving
    messages.
  * Fix `max_inflight_messages` not being set correctly.
  * Fix `mosquitto_passwd -U` backup file creation.
  * CVE-2023-28366: Fix memory leak in broker when clients send
    multiple QoS 2 messages with the same message ID, but then
    never respond to the PUBREC commands.
  * CVE-2023-0809: Fix excessive memory being allocated based on
    malicious initial packets that are not CONNECT packets.
  * CVE-2023-3592: Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT
    packets with a will message that contains invalid property
    types.
  * Broker will now reject Will messages that attempt to publish
    to $CONTROL/.
  * Broker now validates usernames provided in a TLS certificate
    or TLS-PSK identity are valid UTF-8.
  * Fix potential crash when loading invalid persistence file.
  * Library will no longer allow single level wildcard
    certificates, e.g. *.com
  * Fix $SYS messages being expired after 60 seconds and hence
    unchanged values disappearing.
  * Fix some retained topic memory not being cleared immediately
    after used.
  * Fix error handling related to the `bind_interface` option.
  * Fix std* files not being redirected when daemonising, when
    built with assertions removed.
  * Fix default settings incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1.
  * Use line buffered mode for stdout.
  * Fix bridges with non-matching cleansession/local_cleansession
    being expired on start after restoring from persistence
  * Fix connections being limited to 2048 on Windows. The limit
    is now 8192, where supported.
  * Broker will log warnings if sensitive files are world
    readable/writable, or if the owner/group is not the same as
    the user/group the broker is running as. In future versions
    the broker will refuse to open these files.
  * mosquitto_memcmp_const is now more constant time.
  * Only register with DLT if DLT logging is enabled.
  * Fix any possible case where a json string might be
    incorrectly loaded. This could have caused a crash if a
    textname or textdescription field of a role was not a string,
    when loading the dynsec config from file only.
  * Dynsec plugin will not allow duplicate clients/groups/roles
    when loading config from file, which matches the behaviour
    for when creating them.
  * Fix heap overflow when reading corrupt config with "log_dest
    file".
  * Use CLOCK_BOOTTIME when available, to keep track of time.
    This solves the problem of the client OS sleeping and the
    client hence not being able to calculate the actual time for
    keepalive purposes.
  * Fix default settings incorrectly allowing TLS v1.1. Closes
  * Fix high CPU use on slow TLS connect.
  * Fix incorrect topic-alias property value in mosquitto_sub
    json output.
  * Fix confusing message on TLS certificate verification.
  * mosquitto_passwd uses mkstemp() for backup files.
  * `mosquitto_ctrl dynsec init` will refuse to overwrite an
    existing file, without a race-condition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 22 21:15:33 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.15:
  * Deleting the group configured as the anonymous group in the Dynamic Security
    plugin, would leave a dangling pointer that could lead to a single crash.
    This is considered a minor issue - only administrative users should have
    access to dynsec, the impact on availability is one-off, and there is no
    associated loss of data. It is now forbidden to delete the group configured
    as the anonymous group.
  * Fix memory leak when a plugin modifies the topic of a message in
    MOSQ_EVT_MESSAGE.
  * Fix bridge `restart_timeout` not being honoured.
  * Fix potential memory leaks if a plugin modifies the message in the
    MOSQ_EVT_MESSAGE event.
  * Fix unused flags in CONNECT command being forced to be 0, which is not
    required for MQTT v3.1. Closes #2522.
  * Improve documentation of `persistent_client_expiration` option.
    Closes #2404.
  * Add clients to session expiry check list when restarting and reloading from
   persistence. Closes #2546.
  * Fix bridges not sending failure notification messages to the local broker if
    the remote bridge connection fails. Closes #2467. Closes #1488.
  * Fix some PUBLISH messages not being counted in $SYS stats. Closes #2448.
  * Fix incorrect return code being sent in DISCONNECT when a client session is
    taken over. Closes #2607.
  * Fix confusing "out of memory" error when a client is kicked in the dynamic
    security plugin. Closes #2525.
  * Fix confusing error message when dynamic security config file was a
    directory. Closes #2520.
  * Fix bridge queued messages not being persisted when local_cleansession is
    set to false and cleansession is set to true. Closes #2604.
  * Dynamic security: Fix modifyClient and modifyGroup commands to not modify
    the client/group if a new group/client being added is not valid.
  * Dynamic security: Fix the plugin being able to be loaded twice. Currently
    only a single plugin can interact with a unique $CONTROL topic. Using
    multiple instances of the plugin would produce duplicate entries in the
    config file. Closes #2601. Closes #2470.
  * Fix case where expired messages were causing queued messages not to be
    delivered. Closes #2609.
  * Fix websockets not passing on the X-Forwarded-For header.
  * Fix use of `MOSQ_OPT_TLS_ENGINE` being unable to be used due to the openssl
    ctx not being initialised until starting to connect. Closes #2537.
  * Fix incorrect use of SSL_connect. Closes #2594.
  * Don't set SIGPIPE to ignore, use MSG_NOSIGNAL instead. Closes #2564.
  * Add documentation of struct mosquitto_message to header. Closes #2561.
  * Fix documentation omission around mosquitto_reinitialise. Closes #2489.
  * Fix use of MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX when used in conjunction with

  * mosquitto.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  1 19:18:24 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.12
  * Includes security fixes for
    CVE-2021-34434 (bsc#1190048) and CVE-2020-13849 (bsc#1190101)
  Security :
  * An MQTT v5 client connecting with a large number of
    user-property properties could cause excessive CPU usage,
    leading to a loss of performance and possible denial of
    service. This has been fixed.
  * Fix `max_keepalive` not applying to MQTT v3.1.1 and v3.1
    connections.  These clients are now rejected if their keepalive
    value exceeds max_keepalive. This option allows CVE-2020-13849,
    which is for the MQTT v3.1.1 protocol itself rather than an
    implementation, to be addressed.
  * Using certain listener related configuration options e.g.
    `cafile`, that apply to the default listener without defining
    any listener would cause a remotely accessible listener to be
    opened that was not confined to the local machine but did have
    anonymous access enabled, contrary to the documentation.
    This has been fixed. Closes #2283.
  * CVE-2021-34434: If a plugin had granted ACL subscription access
    to a durable/non-clean-session client, then removed that
    access,the client would keep its existing subscription. This
    has been fixed.
  * Incoming QoS 2 messages that had not completed the QoS flow
    were not being checked for ACL access when a clean
    session=False client was reconnecting.  This has been fixed.
  Broker:
  * Fix possible out of bounds memory reads when reading a
    corrupt/crafted configuration file. Unless your configuration
    file is writable by untrusted users this is not a risk.
  * Fix `max_connections` option not being correctly counted.
  * Fix TLS certificates and TLS-PSK not being able to be
    configured at the same time.
  * Disable TLS v1.3 when using TLS-PSK, because it isn't correctly
    configured.
  * Fix `max_keepalive` not applying to MQTT v3.1.1 and v3.1
    connections.  These clients are now rejected if their keepalive
    value exceeds max_keepalive.
  * Fix broker not quiting if e.g. the `password_file` is specified
    as a directory. Closes #2241.
  * Fix listener mount_point not being removed on outgoing messages.
  * Strict protocol compliance fixes, plus test suite.
  * Fix $share subscriptions not being recovered for durable
    clients that reconnect.
  * Update plugin configuration documentation. Closes #2286.
  Client library:
  * If a client uses TLS-PSK then force the default cipher list to
    use "PSK" ciphers only. This means that a client connecting to
    a broker configured with x509 certificates only will now fail.
    Prior to this, the client would connect successfully without#
    verifying certificates, because they were not configured.
  * Disable TLS v1.3 when using TLS-PSK, because it isn't correctly
    configured.
  * Threaded mode is deconfigured when the mosquitto_loop_start()
    thread ends, which allows mosquitto_loop_start() to be called
    again.
  * Fix MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX not being able to be set to NULL.
  * Fix reconnecting failing when MOSQ_OPT_TLS_USE_OS_CERTS was in
    use, but none of capath, cafile, psk, nor MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX were
    set, and MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX_WITH_DEFAULTS was set to the default
    value of true.
  Apps:
  * Fix `mosquitto_ctrl dynsec setDefaultACLAccess` command not
    working.
  Clients:
  * Document TLS certificate behaviour when using `-p 8883`.
  Build:
  * Fix installation using WITH_TLS=no. Closes #2281.
  * Fix builds with libressl 3.4.0. Closes #2198.
  * Remove some unnecessary code guards related to libressl.
  * Fix printf format build warning on MIPS. Closes #2271.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  9 19:10:49 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.11
  Security:
  * If a MQTT v5 client connects with a crafted CONNECT packet a
    memory leak will occur. This has been fixed.
  Broker:
  * Fix possible crash having just upgraded from 1.6 if
    `per_listener_settings true` is set, and a SIGHUP is sent to
    the broker before a client has reconnected to the broker.
  * Fix bridge not reconnectng if the first reconnection attempt
    fails.
  * Improve QoS 0 outgoing packet queueing.
  * Fix QoS 0 messages not being queued when `queue_qos0_messages`
    was enabled.
  Clients:
  * If sending mosquitto_sub output to a pipe, mosquitto_sub will
    now detect that the pipe has closed and disconnect.
  * Fix `mosquitto_pub -l` quitting if a message publication is
    attempted when the broker is temporarily unavailable.
- Remove not longer needed patch:
  * fix-undefined-symbols-in-plugins.patch (fixed upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  6 18:58:02 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.10
  Security:
  * CVE-2021-28166: If an authenticated client connected with
    MQTT v5 sent a malformed CONNACK message to the broker a NULL
    pointer dereference occurred, most likely resulting in a
    segfault. This will be updated with the CVE number when it is
    assigned.
    Affects versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.9 inclusive.
  Broker:
  * Don't over write new receive-maximum if a v5 client connects
    and takes over an old session.
  * Fix CVE-2021-28166. Closes #2163.
  Clients:
  * Set `receive-maximum` to not exceed the `-C` message count in
    mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_rr, to avoid potentially lost
    messages.
  * Fix TLS-PSK mode not working with port 8883.
  Client library:
  * Fix possible socket leak. This would occur if a client was
    using `mosquitto_loop_start()`, then if the connection failed
    due to the remote server being inaccessible they called
    `mosquitto_loop_stop(, true)` and recreated the mosquitto
    object.
  Build:
  * A variety of minor build related fixes, like functions not
    having previous declarations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 12 14:13:54 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Build with support for tcp-wrapper (-DUSE_LIBWRAP=ON)
- Update to version 2.0.9
  Security:
  * If an empty or invalid CA file was provided to the client
    library for verifying the remote broker, then the initialx
    connection would fail but subsequent connections would succeed
     without verifying the remote broker certificate.
  * If an empty or invalid CA file was provided to the broker for
    verifying the remote broker for an outgoing bridge connection
    then the initial connection would fail but subsequent
    connections would succeed without verifying the
    remote broker certificate.
  Broker:
  * Fix encrypted bridge connections incorrectly connecting when
    `bridge_cafile` is empty or invalid.
  * Fix `tls_version` behaviour not matching documentation. It was
    setting the exact TLS version to use, not the minimium TLS
    version to use.
  * Fix messages to `$` prefixed topics being rejected.
  * Fix QoS 0 messages not being delivered when max_queued_bytes
    was configured.
  * Fix bridge increasing backoff calculation.
  * Improve handling of invalid combinations of listener address
    and bind interface configurations.
  * Fix `max_keepalive` option not applying to clients connecting
    with keepalive set to 0.
  Client library:
  * Fix encrypted connections incorrectly connecting when the CA
    file passed to `mosquitto_tls_set()` is empty or invalid.
  * Fix connections retrying very rapidly in some situations.
  Build:
  * Fix cmake epoll detection.

- Refreshed mosquitto-1.6.8-config.patch to apply cleanly again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 28 12:56:09 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.8
  Broker:
  * Fix incorrect datatypes in `struct mosquitto_evt_tick`. This
    changes the size and offset of two of the members of this
    struct, and changes the size of the struct. This is an ABI
    break, but is considered to be acceptable because plugins
    should never be allocating their own instance of this struct,
    and currently none of the struct members are used for anything,
    so a plugin should not be accessing them. It would also be
    safe to read/write from the existing struct parameters.
  * Give compile time warning if libwebsockets compiled without
    external poll support.
  Client library:
  * Fix mosquitto_{pub|sub}_topic_check() functions not returning
    MOSQ_ERR_INVAL on topic == NULL.
  Clients:
  * Fix possible loss of data in `mosquitto_pub -l` when sending
    multiple long lines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Feb  6 21:36:22 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.7
  Broker:
  * Fix some minor memory leaks on exit only.
  * Fix possible memory leak on connect.
  * Fix openssl engine not being able to load private key.
  Clients:
  * Fix config files truncating options after the first space.
  Build:
  - Fix man page building to not absolutely require xsltproc when
    using CMake.
- Update to version 2.0.6
  Broker:
  * Fix calculation of remaining length parameter for websockets
    clients that send fragmented packets.
  Broker:
  * Fix potential duplicate Will messages being sent when a will
    delay interval has been set.
  * Fix message expiry interval property not being honoured in
    `mosquitto_broker_publish` and `mosquitto_broker_publish_copy`.
  * Fix websockets listeners with TLS not responding.
  * Improve logging in obscure cases when a client disconnects.
  * Fix reloading of listeners where multiple listeners have been
    defined with the same port but different bind addresses.
  * Fix `message_size_limit` not applying to the Will payload.
  * The error topic-alias-invalid was being sent if an MQTT v5
    client published a message with empty topic and topic alias
    set, but the topic alias hadn't already been configured on
    the broker. This has been fixed to send a protocol error, as
    per section 3.3.4 of the specification.
  * Note in the man pages that SIGHUP reloads TLS certificates.
  Apps:
  * Allow command line arguments to override config file options in
    mosquitto_ctrl.
  * mosquitto_ctrl: produce an error when requesting a new password
    if both attempts do not match.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 12 07:45:11 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.5
  Broker:
  * Fix "auth_method" not being provided to the extended auth
    plugin event.
  * Fix large packets not being completely published to slow
    clients.
  * Fix bridge connection not relinquishing POLLOUT after messages
    are sent.
  * Fix apparmor incorrectly denying access to
    /var/lib/mosquitto/mosquitto.db.new.
  * Fix potential intermittent initial bridge connections when
    using poll().
  * Fix "bind_interface" option.
  * Fix invalid behaviour in dynsec plugin if a group or client is
    deleted before a role that was attached to the group or client
    is deleted.
  * Improve logging in dynsec addGroupRole/addGroupClient commands.
  Client library:
  * Improve documentation around the "_v5()" and non-v5 functions,
    e.g.  `mosquitto_publish()` and `mosquitto_publish_v5().
  Build:
  * "install" Makefile target should depend on "all", not
    "mosquitto", to ensure that man pages are always built.
  Apps:
  * Disallow control characters in mosquitto_passwd usernames.
  * Fix incorrect description in mosquitto_ctrl man page.
  * Fix `mosquitto_ctrl dynsec getGroup` not showing roles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 23 17:12:17 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.4
  Broker:
  * Fix $SYS/broker/publish/messages/+ counters not being updated
    for QoS 1, 2 messages.

  Build:
  * Fix man pages not being built when using CMake.
- Update to version 2.0.3
  Security:

    `mosquitto_passwd -b password_file username password` would
    cause the username to be used as the password.
  Broker:
  * Fix LWT not being sent on client takeover when the existing
    session wasn't being continued.
  * Fix bridges possibly not completing connections when WITH_ADNS
    is in use.
  * Fix QoS 0 messages not being delivered if max_queued_messages
    was set to 0.
  * Fix local bridges being disconnected on SIGHUP.
  * Fix slow initial bridge connections for WITH_ADNS=no.
  * Fix persistence_location not appending a '/'.
  Clients:
  * Fix mosquitto_sub being unable to terminate with Ctrl-C if a
    successful connection is not made.
  Apps:
  * Fix `mosquitto_passwd -b` using username as password (not if
    `-c` is also used).
  Build:
  * Fix `install` target when using WITH_CJSON=no.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 12 22:03:09 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.2
  Broker:
  * Fix DH group not being set for TLS connections, which meant
    ciphers using DHE couldn't be used.
  * Fix websockets listeners not causing the main loop not to
    wake up.
  Client library:
  * Fix DH group not being set for TLS connections, which meant
    ciphers using DHE couldn't be used.
  Apps:

- Drop patch:
  * mosquitto-fix-cmake-cjson-detection.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  5 17:02:00 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 2.0.0
  !!! Mosquitto 2.0 introduces a number of changes to the
  behaviour of the broker. See the following document for details
  https://mosquitto.org/documentation/migrating-to-2-0/
  Noteworthy changes
  * Mosquitto is now more secure by default and requires users to
    take an active decision in how they configure security on
    their broker, instead of possibly relying on the older very
    permissive behaviour, as well as dropping privileged access
    more quickly
  * A new plugin interface has been introduced which goes beyond
    the existing authentication and access control plugin
    interface to offer more plugin capabilities
  * A new plugin has been introduced to provide client, group,
    and role based authentication and access control.
  * The broker performance has been improved, particularly for
    higher numbers of clients
  * A new utility, mosquitto_ctrl has been added for controlling
    aspects of a running broker.
  * Bridges now support MQTT v5.
  * The mosquitto command line clients have received a variety
    of small improvements. mosquitto_sub can now format its
    output in fixed column widths, for example, and filter its
    output randomly so you can keep an eye on the overall
    behaviour of a topic without having to see every message,
    for example.
- Add patch:
  * mosquitto-fix-cmake-cjson-detection.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 19:29:23 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.12
  Security:
  * In some circumstances, Mosquitto could leak memory when
    handling PUBLISH messages. This is limited to incoming QoS 2
    messages, and is related to the combination of the broker
    having persistence enabled, a clean session=false client,
    which was connected prior to the broker restarting, then has
    reconnected and has now sent messages at a sufficiently high
    rate that the incoming queue at the broker has filled up and
    hence messages are being dropped. This is more likely to have
    an effect where max_queued_messages is a small value.
    This has now been fixed. Closes #1793.
  Broker:
  * Build warning fixes when building with WITH_BRIDGE=no and
    WITH_TLS=no.
  Clients:
  * All clients exit with an error exit code on CONNACK failure.
  * Don't busy loop with `mosquitto_pub -l` on a slow connection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 11 16:05:16 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.11
  Broker:
  * Fix usage message only mentioning v3.1.1.
  * Fix broker refusing to start if only websockets listeners
    were defined.
  * Change systemd unit files to create /var/log/mosquitto before
    starting.
  * Don't quit with an error if opening the log file isn't
    possible.
  * Fix bridge topic remapping when using "" as the topic.
  * Fix messages being queued for disconnected bridges when clean
    start was set to true.
  * Fix `autosave_interval` not being triggered by messages being
    delivered.
  * Fix websockets clients sometimes not being disconnected
    promptly.
  * Fix "slow" file based logging by switching to line based
    buffering.
  * Log protocol error message where appropriate from a bad
    UNSUBSCRIBE, rather than the generic "socket error".
  * Don't try to start DLT logging if DLT unavailable, to avoid a
    long delay when shutting down the broker.
  * Fix potential memory leaks.
  * Fix clients not receiving messages after a previous client
    with the same client ID and positive will delay interval quit.
  * Fix overly broad HAVE_PTHREAD_CANCEL compile guard.
  Client library:
  * Improved documentation around connect callback return codes.
  * Fix `mosquitto_publish*()` no longer returning
    `MOSQ_ERR_NO_CONN` when not connected.
  * `mosquitto_loop_start()` now sets a thread name on Linux

Tue May 26 06:36:17 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.10
  Broker:
  * Report invalid bridge prefix+pattern combinations at config
    parsing time rather than letting the bridge fail later.
  * Fix `mosquitto_passwd -b` not updating passwords for existing
    users correctly. Creating a new user with `-b` worked without
    problem.
  * Fix memory leak when connecting clients rejected.
  * Don't disconnect clients that are already disconnected. This
    prevents the session expiry being extended on SIGHUP.

- Update to version 1.6.9
  Broker:
  * Fix session expiry with very large expiry intervals.
  * Check ACL patterns for validity when loading.
  * Use presence of password file as indicator for whether username
    checks should take place, not whether usernames are defined in
    the password file.
  * Strip whitespace from end of config file string options.
  * Satisfy valgrind when exiting on error due to not being able
    to open a listening socket, by calling freeaddrinfo.

  Client library:
  * Set minimum keepalive argument to `mosquitto_connect*()` to be
    5 seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 21 14:38:08 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.5
  Fix CVE-2019-11779:
  * In Eclipse Mosquitto 1.5.0 to 1.6.5 inclusive, if a malicious MQTT
    client sends a SUBSCRIBE packet containing a topic that consists
    of approximately 65400 or more '/' characters, i.e. the topic
    hierarchy separator, then a stack overflow will occur.
  Broker:
  * Fix v5 DISCONNECT packets with remaining length == 2 being
    treated as a protocol error.
  * Fix support for libwebsockets 3.x.
  * Fix slow websockets performance when sending large messages.
  * Fix clients authorised using `use_identity_as_username` or
    `use_subject_as_username` being disconnected on SIGHUP.
  * Improve error messages in some situations when clients disconnect.
    Reduces the number of "Socket error on client X, disconnecting"
    messages.
  * Fix Will for v5 clients not being sent if will delay interval was
    greater than the session expiry interval.
  * Fix CRL file not being reloaded on HUP.
  Client library:
  * Fix reconnect backoff for the situation where connections are
    dropped rather than refused.
  * Fix missing locks on `mosq->state`.

- Update to version 1.6.4
  Fix CVE-2019-11778:
  * If an MQTT v5 client connects to Eclipse Mosquitto versions 1.6.0
    to 1.6.4 inclusive, sets a last will and testament, sets a will
    delay interval, sets a session expiry interval, and the will delay
    interval is set longer than the session expiry interval, then a
    use after free error occurs, which has the potential to cause a
    crash in some situations.
  Broker:
  * Fix incoming QoS 2 messages being blocked when
    `max_inflight_messages` was set to 1.
  * Fix incoming messages not being removed for a client if the topic
    being published to does not have any subscribers.
  Client library:
  * Fix MQTT v5 subscription options being incorrectly set for
    MQTT v3 subscriptions.
  * Make behaviour of `mosquitto_connect_async()` consistent with
    `mosquitto_connect()` when connecting to a non-existent server.
  * `mosquitto_string_option(mosq, MOSQ_OPT_TLS_KEYFORM, ...)` was
    incorrectly returning `MOSQ_ERR_INVAL` with valid input. This has
    been fixed.

    if a v5 client connects to a v3.x broker and is sent a CONNACK with
    the "unacceptable protocol version" connack reason code.
  * Fix memory leak when setting v5 properties in mosquitto_connect_v5().
  * Fix properties not being sent on QoS>0 PUBLISH messages.
  Clients:
  * mosquitto_pub: fix error codes not being returned when

  * All clients: improve error messages when connecting to a v3.x broker
    when in v5 mode.
  Other:
  - Various documentation fixes.

- Update to version 1.6.3
  Broker:
  * Fix detection of incoming v3.1/v3.1.1 bridges.
  * Fix default max_topic_alias listener config not being copied to
    the in-use listener when compiled without TLS support.
  * Fix random number generation if compiling using `WITH_TLS=no` and
    on Linux with glibc >= 2.25. Without this fix, no random numbers
    would be generated for e.g. on broker client id generation, and so
    clients connecting expecting this feature would be unable to connect.
  * Fix compilation problem related to `getrandom()` on non-glibc systems.
  * Fix Will message for a persistent client incorrectly being sent when the
    client reconnects after a clean disconnect.
  - Fix Will message for a persistent client not being sent on disconnect.
  * Improve documentation around the upgrading of persistence files.
  * Add 'extern "C"' on mosquitto_broker.h and mosquitto_plugin.h for
    C++ plugin writing.
  * Fix persistent Websockets clients not receiving messages after they
    reconnect, having sent DISCONNECT on a previous session
  * Disable TLS renegotiation. Client initiated renegotiation is considered to
    be a potential attack vector against servers.
  * Fix incorrect shared subscription topic '$shared'.
  * Fix zero length client ids being rejected for MQTT v5 clients with clean
    start set to true.
  * Fix MQTT v5 overlapping subscription behaviour. Clients now receive message
    from all matching subscriptions rather than the first one encountered, which
    ensures the maximum QoS requirement is met.
  * Fix incoming/outgoing quota problems for QoS>0.
  * Remove obsolete `store_clean_interval` from documentation.
  * Fix v4 authentication plugin never calling psk_key_get.
  Clients:
  * Fix -L url parsing when `/topic` part is missing.
  * Stop some error messages being printed even when `--quiet` was used.
  * Fix mosquitto_pub exiting with error code 0 when an error occurred.
  * Fix mosquitto_pub not using the `-c` option.
  * Fix MQTT v5 clients not being able to specify a password without a
    username.
  * Fix `mosquitto_pub -l` not handling network failures.
  * Fix `mosquitto_pub -l` not handling zero length input.
  * Fix double free on exit in mosquitto_pub.

- Update to version 1.6.2
  Broker:
  * Fix memory access after free, leading to possible crash, when v5
    client with Will message disconnects, where the Will message has
    as its first property one of `content-type`, `correlation-data`,
    `payload-format-indicator`, or `response-topic`.
  * Fix Will message not allowing user-property properties.
  * Fix broker originated messages (e.g. $SYS/broker/version) not being
    published when `check_retain_source` set to true.
  * Fix $SYS/broker/version being incorrectly expired after 60 seconds.

Thu Apr 18 08:47:30 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0
  Broker features
  * Add support for MQTT v5

  * Add TLS Engine support.
  * Add support for ALPN on TLS connections.
  * Add -D option for all clients to specify MQTT v5 properties.
  * Add -E to mosquitto_sub, which causes it to exit immediately after
    having its subscriptions acknowledged. Use with -c to create a
    durable client session without requiring a message to be received.
  * Add --remove-retained to mosquitto_sub, which can be used to clear
    retained messages on a broker.
  * Add --repeat and --repeat-delay to mosquitto_pub, which can be
    used to repeat single message publishes at a regular interval.
  * -V now accepts 5, 311, 31, as well as mqttv5 etc.

  Client library fixes
  * Add missing mosquitto_userdata() function.
  Client fixes
  * mosquitto_pub wouldn't always publish all messages when using -l
    and QoS>0. This has been fixed.
  * mosquitto_sub was incorrectly encoding special characters when
    using %j output format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 28 23:09:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.8
  Broker:
  * Fix clients being disconnected when ACLs are in use. This only
    affects the case where a client connects using a username, and
    the anonymous ACL list is defined but specific user ACLs are
    not defined.
  * Fix delayed bridge local subscriptions causing missing messages.
  Library:
  * Use higher resolution timer for random initialisation of client
    id generation.
  * Fix some Coverity Scan reported errors that could occur when the
    library was already quitting.

- Use HTTPS for all URLs
- Verify source signature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 14 09:51:33 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.7
  Broker:
  - Ensure that an error occurs if `per_listener_settings true` is
    given after other security options.
  - Fix case where old unreferenced msg_store messages were being
    saved to the persistence file, bloating its size unnecessarily.
  Library:
  - Fix `mosquitto_topic_matches_sub()` not returning MOSQ_ERR_INVAL
    for invalid subscriptions like `topic/#abc`. This only affects
    the return value, not the match/no match result, which was
    already correct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 21:14:36 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.6
  Security:
  * Fix CVE-2018-12551 (bsc#1125021): If Mosquitto is configured to
    use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in
    the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means
    that the malformed data becomes a username and no password.
    If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get
    access to the broker by using the malformed username. In
    particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username.
    Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used
    the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password
    files are unaffected by this vulnerability.
  * Fix CVE-2018-12550 (bsc#1125021): If an ACL file is empty, or
    has only blank lines or comments, then mosquitto treats the ACL
    file as not being defined, which means that no topic access is
    denied. Although denying access to all topics is not a useful
    configuration, this behaviour is unexpected and could lead
    to access being incorrectly granted in some circumstances. This
    is now fixed.
  * Fix CVE-2018-12546 (bsc#1125019): If a client publishes a retained
    message to a topic that they have access to, and then their access
    to that topic is revoked, the retained message will still be
    delivered to future subscribers. This behaviour may be undesirable
    in some applications, so a configuration option `check_retain_source`
    has been introduced to enforce checking of the retained message
    source on publish.
  Broker:
  * Fixed comment handling for config options that have optional
    arguments.
  * Improved documentation around bridge topic remapping.
  * Handle mismatched handshakes (e.g. QoS1 PUBLISH with QoS2
    reply) properly.
  * Fix spaces not being allowed in the bridge remote_username
    option.
  * Allow broker to always restart on Windows when using
    `log_dest file`.
  * Fix Will not being sent for Websockets clients.
  * Windows: Fix possible crash when client disconnects.
  * Fixed durable clients being unable to receive messages when
    offline, when per_listener_settings was set to true.
  * Add log message for the case where a client is disconnected for
    sending a topic with invalid UTF-8.
  Library:
  * Fix TLS connections not working over SOCKS.
  * Don't clear SSL context when TLS connection is closed, meaning
    if a user provided an external SSL_CTX they have less chance of
    leaking references.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 17 20:15:50 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- FIX CVE-2018-20145: mosquitto: ACL bypass (bnc#1119536)
- Update to version 1.5.5
  Security:
  * If `per_listener_settings` is set to true, then the `acl_file` setting was
    ignored for the "default listener" only. This has been fixed. This does not
    affect any listeners defined with the `listener` option.
  Broker:
  * Add `socket_domain` option to allow listeners to disable IPv6 support.
    This is required to work around a problem in libwebsockets that means
    sockets only listen on IPv6 by default if IPv6 support is compiled in.
  * When using ADNS, don't ask for all network protocols when connecting,
    because this can lead to confusing "Protocol not supported" errors if the
    network is down.
  * Fix outgoing retained messages not being sent by bridges on initial
    connection.
  * Don't reload auth_opt_ options on reload, to match the behaviour of the
    other plugin options.
  * Print message on error when installing/uninstalling as a Windows service.
  * All non-error connect/disconnect messages are controlled by the
    `connection_messages` option.
  Library:
  * Fix reconnect delay backoff behaviour.
  * Don't call on_disconnect() twice if keepalive tests fail.
  Client:
  * Always print leading zeros in mosquitto_sub when output format is hex.
  Build:
  * Fix building where TLS-PSK is not available.

- Update to version 1.5.4
  Security:
  * When using a TLS enabled websockets listener with "require_certificate"
    enabled, the mosquitto broker does not correctly verify client certificates.
    This is now fixed. All other security measures operate as expected, and in
    particular non-websockets listeners are not affected by this.
  Broker:
  * Process all pending messages even when a client has disconnected. This means
    a client that send a PUBLISH then DISCONNECT quickly, then disconnects will
    have its DISCONNECT message processed properly and so no Will will be sent.
  * $SYS/broker/clients/disconnected should never be negative.
  * Give better error message if a client sends a password without a username.
  * Fix bridge not honoring restart_timeout.
  * Don't disconnect a client if an auth plugin denies access to SUBSCRIBE.
  Library:
  * Fix memory leak that occurred if mosquitto_reconnect() was used when TLS
    errors were present.
  * Fix TLS connections when using an external event loop with
    mosquitto_loop_read() and mosquitto_write().
  Build:
  * Fix clients not being compiled with threading support when using CMake.
  * Use _GNU_SOURCE to fix build errors in websockets and getaddrinfo usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 25 18:06:26 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.5.3
  Security:
  * Fix CVE-2018-12543. If a message is sent to Mosquitto with a topic that
    begins with $, but is not $SYS, then an assert that should be unreachable is
    triggered and Mosquitto will exit.
  Broker:
  * Elevate log level to warning for situation when socket limit is hit.
  * Fix retained messages not sent by bridges on outgoing topics at the first
    connection.
  * Fix duplicate clients being added to by_id hash before the old client was
    removed.

- Update to version 1.5.2
  Broker:
  * Fix incorrect call to setsockopt() for TCP_NODELAY.
  * Fix excessive CPU usage when the number of sockets exceeds the system limit.
  * Fix round_robin false behaviour.
  * Fix segfault on HUP when bridges and security options are configured.
  Library:
  * Fix situation where username and password is used with SOCKS5 proxy.
  * Fix SOCKS5 behaviour when passing IP addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 19 16:38:42 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.5.1
  Broker:
  * Fix plugin cleanup function not being called on exit of the broker.
  * Print more OpenSSL errors when loading certificates/keys fail.
  * Use AF_UNSPEC etc. instead of PF_UNSPEC to comply with POSIX.
  * Remove use of AI_ADDRCONFIG, which means the broker can be used on systems
    where only the loopback interface is defined.
  * Fix IPv6 addresses not being able to be used as bridge addresses.
  * All clients now time out if they exceed their keepalive*1.5, rather than
    just reach it. This was inconsistent in two places.
  * Fix segfault on startup if bridge CA certificates could not be read.
  * Fix problem opening listeners on Pi caused by unsigned char being default.
  * ACL patterns that do not contain either %c or %u now produce a warning in
    the log.
  * Fix bridge publishing failing when per_listener_settings was true.
  * Fix `use_identity_as_username true` not working.
  * Fix UNSUBACK messages not being logged.
  * Fix possible endian issue when reading the `memory_limit` option.
  * Fix building for libwebsockets < 1.6.
  * Fix accessor functions for username and client id when used in plugin auth
    check.

  Library:
  * Fix some places where return codes were incorrect, including to the
    on_disconnect() callback. This has resulted in two new error codes,
    MOSQ_ERR_KEEPALIVE and MOSQ_ERR_LOOKUP.
  * Fix connection problems when mosquitto_loop_start() was called before
    mosquitto_connect_async().

  Clients:
  * When compiled using WITH_TLS=no, the default port was incorrectly being set
    to -1. This has been fixed.
  * Fix compiling on Mac OS X <10.12.

  Build:
  * Fixes for building on NetBSD.
  * Fixes for building on FreeBSD.
  * Add support for compiling with static libwebsockets library.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 18:47:04 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.5
  Security:
  * Fix memory leak that could be caused by a malicious CONNECT packet. This
    does not yet have a CVE assigned. Closes #533493 (on Eclipse bugtracker)

  Broker features:
  * Add per_listener_settings to allow authentication and access control to be
    per listener.
  * Add limited support for reloading listener settings. This allows settings
    for an already defined listener to be reloaded, but port numbers must not be
    changed.
  * Add ability to deny access to SUBSCRIBE messages as well as the current
    read/write accesses. Currently for auth plugins only.
  * Reduce calls to malloc through the use of UHPA.
  * Outgoing messages with QoS>1 are no longer retried after a timeout period.
    Messages will be retried when a client reconnects.  This change in behaviour
    can be justified by considering when the timeout may have occurred.
    + If a connection is unreliable and has dropped, but without one end
      noticing, the messages will be retried on reconnection. Sending
      additional PUBLISH or PUBREL would not have changed anything.
    + If a client is overloaded/unable to respond/has a slow connection then
      sending additional PUBLISH or PUBREL would not help the client catch
      up. Once the backlog has cleared the client will respond. If it is not
      able to catch up, sending additional duplicates would not help either.
  * Add use_subject_as_username option for certificate based client
    authentication to use the entire certificate subject as a username, rather
    than just the CN. Closes #469467.

    default is to allow anonymous access unless another security option is set.
    For example, if password_file is set and allow_anonymous is not set, then
    anonymous access will be denied. It is still possible to allow anonymous
    access by setting it explicitly.

Thu Mar  1 14:37:54 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 1.4.15
  Security:
  * Fix CVE-2017-7652. If a SIGHUP is sent to the broker when there are no more
    file descriptors, then opening the configuration file will fail and security
    settings will be set back to their default values.
  * Fix CVE-2017-7651. Unauthenticated clients can cause excessive memory use by
    setting "remaining length" to be a large value. This is now mitigated by
    limiting the size of remaining length to valid values. A "memory_limit"
    configuration option has also been added to allow the overall memory used by
    the broker to be limited.

  Broker:
  * Use constant time memcmp for password comparisons.
  * Fix incorrect PSK key being used if it had leading zeroes.
  * Fix memory leak if a client provided a username/password for a listener with
    use_identity_as_username configured.
  * Fix use_identity_as_username not working on websockets clients.
  * Don't crash if an auth plugin returns MOSQ_ERR_AUTH for a username check on
    a websockets client. Closes #490.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  5 20:35:17 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to 1.4.13
  * Security:
    - Fix CVE-2017-9868. The persistence file was readable
      by all local users, potentially allowing sensitive
      information to be leaked.
      This can also be fixed administratively, by restricting
      access to the directory in which the persistence file
      is stored.

  * Broker:
    - Fix for poor websockets performance.
    - Fix lazy bridges not timing out for idle_timeout.
    - Fix problems with large retained messages over websockets.
    - Set persistence file to only be readable by owner,
      except on Windows.

      are now "sent".
    - Auth plugins can be configured to disable the check for +# in
      usernames/client ids with the auth_plugin_deny_special_chars
      option.  Partially closes #462.
    - Restrictions for CVE-2017-7650 have been relaxed - '/' is
      allowed in usernames/client ids. Remainder of fix for #462.

  Clients:
    - Don't use / in auto-generated client ids.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 29 20:19:58 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to 1.4.12
  * Security:
    - Fix CVE-2017-7650, which allows clients with username or
      client id set to '#' or '+' to bypass pattern based ACLs or
      third party plugins. The fix denies message sending or
      receiving of messages for clients with a '#' or '+' in their
      username or client id and if the message is subject to a
      pattern ACL check or plugin check.
  * Broker:
    - Fix mosquitto.db from becoming corrupted due to client
      messages being
      persisted with no stored message. Closes #424.

- update to 1.4.8
  - Broker:
    - Wills published by clients connected to a listener with
      mount_point defined now correctly obey the mount point. This
