Mon Oct 28 13:11:49 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire rsvg-convert instead of rsvg-view on TW: the
  rsvg-view program has been dropped, leaving only the rsvg-convert
  binary behind. For this reason, the package name was adjusted

Sat Apr 28 16:25:40 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Updated standalone library libmypaint already provides its own
  lang files; just strip mypaint-lang of all libmypaint.mo files
  to avoid a file conflict between the libmypaint-lang and
  mypaint-lang.
- Recommend instead of requiring lang package.
- Don't run desktop database and icon cache update scripts as part
  of post(un) for openSUSE >=1500; these are taken care of by
  rpm's file triggers.
