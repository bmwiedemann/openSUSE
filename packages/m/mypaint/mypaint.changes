Fri May 29 20:04:01 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.0.1:
  * HSV/HCY brush dynamics in 2.x mode fixed.
  * Undo/Redo stack size made configurable and more efficient.
  * Undo/Redo stack default size increased to 40.
  * Rounding error when saving files in 2.x mode fixed.
  * Invalid l11n strings fixed.

  * Dependency on intltool removed (still required for
    libmypaint).
  * Variables in l11n strings validated on build (xml tags are not
    validated yet, however).
  * libmypaint translations are now bound, making them work
    properly in the appimages.
  * OARS rating added to appdata (relevant for app-distribution
    software, but not much else).
  * A number of Py3 compatibility issues were fixed.
  * Svg icons fixed - some were previously considered invalid by
    librsvg >= 2.48.
  * Svg icon sizes reduced across the board.
  * Typos in documentation fixed (not user-facing typos).
- Drop mypaint-python3-pass-str-to-exec.patch: upstreamed.

Mon Oct 28 13:11:49 UTC 2019 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire rsvg-convert instead of rsvg-view on TW: the
  rsvg-view program has been dropped, leaving only the rsvg-convert
  binary behind. For this reason, the package name was adjusted
  to properly reflect its content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  9 08:50:30 UTC 2019 - Bernhard Wiedemann <bwiedemann@suse.com>

  obsoletes it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 30 16:16:57 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Limit fdupes to one partition, /usr.

  in the standard search paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 28 16:25:40 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Updated standalone library libmypaint already provides its own
  lang files; just strip mypaint-lang of all libmypaint.mo files
  to avoid a file conflict between the libmypaint-lang and
  mypaint-lang.
- Recommend instead of requiring lang package.
- Don't run desktop database and icon cache update scripts as part
  of post(un) for openSUSE >=1500; these are taken care of by
  rpm's file triggers.
- Fix env-based hashbang in the main app binary.
