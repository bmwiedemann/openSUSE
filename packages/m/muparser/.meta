  <title>A fast math parser library</title>
  <description>This package is based on the package 'muparser' from project 'Education'.


    Many applications require the parsing of mathematical expressions. The main
    objective of this library is to provide a fast and easy way of doing this.
    muParser is an extensible high performance math parser library written in
    C++. It works by transforming a mathematical expression into bytecode and
    precalculating constant parts of the expression.

    The library is written in pure C++ and should compile on every standard
    compliant compiler. The parser archive comes with projects for a variety of
    platforms. The code runs on 32 bit and 64 bit architechture and has been
    tested using MS VC++ V8.0 and GCC V4.2.4. It reportedly works on BCB too.
    Code samples are provided in order to help you understand its usage. The
    library is open source and distributed under the MIT license.
