%description
MegaGlest takes place in a context that could be compared to that of
pre-Renaissance Europe with the twist that magic forces exist in the
environment and can be controlled.

A game takes place on a map of varying size, such as large plains and
fields, with terrain features like rivers, mountains, seas, or
cliffs. Players must establish settlements to gain resources, defend
against other players, and train units to explore the map and attack
enemies.
