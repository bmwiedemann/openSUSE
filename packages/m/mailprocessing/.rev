    <comment>New revision (post spec-cleaner). Original submission text:

This is a new package and I would be  be happy to maintain it in Factory and
beyond. I already maintain it upstream.

Short summary: mailprocessing is a mail filter configured by user provided
Python scripts - a Turing complete mail filter if you will. It is a
fork/continuation of Joel Rosdahl's maildirproc
(http://joel.rosdahl.net/maildirproc/ ). It consists of the maildirproc utility
(which filters email in local maildirs) and the imapproc utility (which filters
email in remote IMAP folders).

In terms of packaging, maintenance overhead should be fairly low. Joel made
sure to implement maildirproc using just the Python 3 standard library and I
continued that tradition.</comment>

    <comment>- Switch back to tarball from Github (used to be the setup.py generated one)

- Update to mailprocessing-1.2.6
  * Added example logrotate configurations
  * Added SIGHUP handler for reopening log files (useful for
    log rotation)
  * Use locking for PID and log files. You need to specify
    dedicated PID and lock files if you want to run multiple
    concurrent imapproc processes.
  * Write PID file
  * Improve signal handling and cleanup after receiving fatal
    signals. Continuous mode in particular is a lot more
    reliable and predictable now.
  * Download message headers in a batched manner
  * Download message flags in a batched manner
  * Various documentation and release engineering fixes/cleanups</comment>
