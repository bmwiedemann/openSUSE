  <description>
Nagios plugin (script) to check the status of a NIS server on a specified host and NIS domain by asking NIS server for &quot;passwd.byname&quot;.

As an additional check, a username may be specified which will then be &quot;looked up&quot; on the NIS server, note that this is optional and only introduced in v1.1

Script returns OK if it gets an acceptable answer, CRITICAL if not.

This *nix script has been designed and written for the lowest common denominator of shells (sh), uses yppoll, ypcat and grep as external commands.
