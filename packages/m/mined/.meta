  <title>Powerful Text Editor with Extensive Unicode and CJK Support</title>
  <description>Mined is a powerful text editor with a comprehensive and easy-to-use
user interface and fast, small-footprint behavior.

It was the first editor that provided Unicode support in a plain-text
terminal. It now has both extensive Unicode and CJK support offering
many specific features and covering special cases that other editors
are not aware of (like autodetection features and automatic handling of
terminal variations or Han character information). Basically, it is an
editor tailored to efficient editing of plain text documents and
programs with features and interactive behavior designed for this
purpose.

Mined Overview

Good interactive features * Intuitive user interface

* Logical and consistent concept of navigating and editing text
   (without ancient line-end handling limitations or insert or
   append confusion)

* Supports various control styles: Editing with command control,
   function key control, or menu control Navigation by cursor keys,
   control keys, mouse or scrollbar

* Comprehensive menus (driven by keyboard or mouse)

* &quot;HOP&quot; key paradigm doubles the number of navigation functions that
   can be most easily reached and remembered by intuitively
   amplifying the associated function

* Immediate adjustment if the window size is changed in any state of
   interaction

Versatile character encoding support * Extensive Unicode support,
   including double-width and combining characters, script
   highlighting, various methods of character input support (mapped
   keyboard input methods, mnemonic and numeric input), supporting
   CJK, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Arabic, and other scripts

* Support of bidirectional terminals, Arabic ligature joining

* East Asian character set support: handling of major CJK encodings
   (including GB18030 and full EUC-JP with combining characters) in
   either Unicode terminal or CJK terminal

* Support for a variety of 8-bit encodings (mapped to Unicode) (with
   combining characters for Vietnamese and Thai)

* Support of CJK input methods by enhanced keyboard mapping
   including multiple choice mappings (handled by a pick list menu);
   characters in the pick list being sorted by relevance of Unicode
   ranges

* Han character information with description and pronunciation

* Autodetection of text character encoding, edit of files with mixed
   character encoding sections (such as mailboxes), transparent
   handling of UTF-16 encoded files

* Autodetection of UTF-8 and CJK terminal mode and detailed features
   (like different Unicode width and combining data versions)

* Encoding support tested with: xterm, mlterm, hanterm, cxterm,
   rxvt, linux console

Many useful text editing capabilities * Many text editing features,
   such as paragraph wrapping, autoindentation and back-tab, smart
   quotes (with quotation marks style selection and autodetection),
   and smart dashes

* Search and replacement patterns can have multiple lines

* Cross-session paste buffer (copy and paste between multiple--even
   subsequent or remote--invocations of mined)

* Marker stack for quick return to previous text positions

* Multiple paste buffers (emacs-style)

* Program editing features, HTML support and syntax highlighting,
   identifier and function definition search, also across files;
   structure input support

* Text and program layout features; autoindentation and undent
   function (back-tab), numbered item justification

* Systematic text and file handling safety, avoiding loss of data

* Visible indications of special text contents (TAB characters,
   different line-end types, character codes that cannot be
   displayed in the current mode)

* Full binary transparent editing with visible indications (illegal
   UTF-8 or CJK, mixed line end types, NUL characters, etc.)

* Print function that works in all text encodings

* Optional emacs command mode

Small-footprint operation and portability * Plain text mode
   (terminal) operation, supporting wide range of terminals

* Instant start-up

* Runs on many platforms: Unix (Linux/Sun/HP/BSD/Mac and more), DOS
   (djgpp), Windows (cygwin)

* Makefiles also support legacy systems</description>
