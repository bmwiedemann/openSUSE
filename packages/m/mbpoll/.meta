  <title>command line utility to communicate with ModBus slave (RTU or TCP)</title>
  <description>mbpoll uses libmodbus (http://libmodbus.org/).  
Although the syntax of these options is very close modpoll proconX program,
it is a completely independent project.

mbpoll can:
 - read discrete inputs
 - read and write binary outputs (coil)
 - read input registers
 - read and write output registers (holding register)

The reading and writing registers may be in decimal, hexadecimal or 
floating single precision.
