- Update to version 4.1
  Changes
  * Automatically detect and add `altnet` to interfaces with
    multiple addresses, possible thanks to work on.
  * Reduce number of exposed aliases to debug sub-systems in
    online help text and man page. Only primary name, as of
    mrouted v3.9-beta3.
  * Removed noisy `timer` sub-system from `-d all`, use
    `-d all, timer`.
  Fixes
  * Fix update of `mrouted.genid` on SIGHUP and reboot.  mrouted
    replaced contents with the value zero (0), causing a zero
    genid in DVMRP as well, which likely caused peering issues
    with some implementations
  * Workaround for older autoconf without `--runstatedir` support
  * Fix double free in `pidfile()`
  * Cannot disable multicast routing in kernel: Permission denied
    when starting up.
  * Refactor interface probing and bringup. Fixes issue with the
    `no phyint` config option not working, introduced in v4.0.
  * Fix bad path for mrouted.genid, should be in `/var/lib/misc`
    on Linux and `/var/db` on *BSD.
  * Document and improve error message when running out of IGMP
    groups on Linux.
  * Detect and warn if multicast ingresses an unknown vif

- Update to version 4.0
  Major release with full IGMPv3 (ASM) support and a new
  mroutectl tool.
  Note: command line options have been changed!
  Changes
  * Support for IGMPv3, both sending queries and accepting
    membership reports.
  * Support for configurable IGMP query interval.
  * Support for configurable IGMP robustness variable.
  * Incompatible command line option refactor.
  * New directive in mrouted.conf: no phyint, reverses the default
    behavior of mrouted. Interfaces can then selectively be enabled
  * Support for disabling the IP router-alert option
    md unit file.
  * Introduce mroutectl, a helpful tool to interact with mrouted.
    This completely replaces mrouted.cache and mrouted.dump,
    including SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals, which are now ignored.
  * The mrouted.pid file, and the new mrouted.sock file, are now
    located in /var/run
  * Major cleanup of logging directives read from the command line,
    and from mroutectl. Use -d ?, and -l ? to list alternatives.
  Fixes
  * Fix #20: Replace obsolete gethostbyname() w/ getaddrinfo()
  * Fix #25: Save mrouted.genid to persistent store in /var/lib
    instead of /var/run
  * Fixed libc portability issues, e.g. GNU:isms like %m etc.
  * Import OpenBSD fix to daemon() equivalent, use /dev/null for
    stdin, stdout and stderr.
  * Use clock_gettime(), with monotonic clock, instead of the
    unsafe gethostbyname(), for all non-date-printing code paths.
    Only for mrouted, other tools have not been changed.
  * Fix lots of invalid format specifiers
  * Fix memory leaks in mrouted on SIGHUP.
