free software compilers.

This subpackage contains the header files.

Summary:        Stub pthread header files for MinGW

Provides:       mingw64-unistd-pthread-devel

%description dummy-pthread
This subpackage contains stub pthread header files that are empty
and only exist to satisfy dependencies in MinGW's unistd.h until
an actual pthread implementation (like winpthreads) is installed.
