  <title>Nine men's morris game</title>
  <description>Morris is an implementation of the board game &quot;Nine Men's Morris&quot;.
Other names for this game are: Mills, Merrills, Morris, or Mühle in
German.
This implementation of Nine Men's Morris supports not only the
standard game, but also several rule-variants and different board
layouts. You can play against the computer, or simply use the
program to present the board, but play against another human
opponent. The computer opponent learns from previous games and
tries not to make the same mistake twice.

Among others, the game plays the following variants:
  * Lasker variant (moves are also allowed in the set-phase)
  * the Möbius board (invented by Ingo Althöfer)
  * the Windmill board
  * Pentagon and Hexagon boards
  * Morabaraba
  * Six and Seven Men's Morris
  * Tapatan, Achi, Nine Holes

Furthermore, the game supports:
  * advanced AI controls to tweak AI playing style
  * giving hints for good moves
  * showing the principal variation
  * move takeback (undo and redo)
  * internationalization (English, German, Chinese)
  * many board and rule variations, as well as free customization
    of rules
  * configurable display
