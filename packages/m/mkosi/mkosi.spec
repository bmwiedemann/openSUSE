%description
A fancy wrapper around dnf --installroot, debootstrap, pacstrap and zypper that
may generate disk images with a number of bells and whistles.

Generated images are "legacy-free". This means only GPT disk labels
(and no MBR disk labels) are supported, and only systemd based images
may be generated. Moreover, for bootable images only EFI systems are
supported (not plain MBR/BIOS).
