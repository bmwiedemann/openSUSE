- update to version 11:
  - Support for Rocky Linux, Alma Linux, and Gentoo has been added!
  - A new `ManifestFormat=` option can be used to generate "manifest" files that
    describe what packages were installed. With `json`, a JSON file that shows
    the names and versions of all installed packages will be created. With
    `changelog`, a longer human-readable file that shows package descriptions and
    changelogs will be generated. This latter format should be considered
    experimental and likely to change in later versions.
  - A new `RemovePackages=` option can be used to uninstall packages after the
    build and finalize scripts have been done. This is useful for the case where
    packages are required by the build scripts, or pulled in as dependencies
    for scriptlets of other packages, but are not necessary in the final image.
  - A new `BaseImage=` option can be used to build "system extensions" a.k.a.
    "sysexts" â€” partial images which are mounted on top of an existing system
    to provide additional files under `/usr/`. See the
    [systemd-sysext man page](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sysext.html)
    for more information.
  - A new `CleanPackageMetadata=` option can be used to force or disable the
    removal of package manager files. When this option is not used, they are
    removed when the package manager is not installed in the final image.
  - A new `UseHostRepositories=` option instructs mkosi to use repository
    configuration from the host system, instead of the internal list.
  - A new `SshAgent=` option configures the path to the ssh agent.
  - A new `SshPort=` option overrides the port used for ssh.
  - The `Verity=` setting supports a new value `signed`. When set, verity data
    will be signed and the result inserted as an additional partition in the
    image. See https://systemd.io/DISCOVERABLE_PARTITIONS for details about
    signed disk images. This information is used by `systemd-nspawn`,
    `systemd-dissect`, `systemd-sysext`, `systemd-portabled` and `systemd`'s
    `RootImage=` setting (among others) to cryptographically validate the image
    file systems before use.
  - The `--build-environment=` option was renamed to `--environment=` and
    extended to cover *all* invoked scripts, not just the `mkosi.build`.
    The old name is still understood.
  - With `--with-network=never`, `dnf` is called with `--cacheonly`, so that the
    package lists are not refreshed. This gives a degree of reproducibility when
    doing repeated installs with the same package set (and also makes installs
    significantly faster).
  - The `--debug=` option gained a new value `disk` to show information about disk
    sized and partition allocations.
  - Some sections and settings have been renamed for clarity: [Packages] is now
    [Content], `Password=`, `PasswordIsHashed=`, and `Autologin=` are now in
    [Content]. The old names are still supported, but not documented.
  - When `--prepare-script=`/`--build-script=`/`--finalize-script=` is used with
    an empty argument, the corresponding script will not be called.
  - Python 3.7 is the minimal supported version.
  - Note to packagers: the Python `cryptography` module is needed for signing
    of verity data.
