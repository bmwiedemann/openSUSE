    <comment>- Removed obsolete patch  opensuse-dont-install-distribution-release-by-default.patch
- Update to 23.1:
  * Respin due to git tag mismatch
- Update to 23:
  * Added CleanScripts= to allow running custom cleanup code whenever
    mkosi cleans up the output directory. This allows cleaning up extra
    outputs produced by e.g. a build script that mkosi doesn't know about.
  * Added ConfigureScripts= to allow dynamically modifying the mkosi
    configuration. Each configure script receives the current config as
    JSON on stdin and should output the new config as JSON on stdout.
  * When building a UKI, we don't measure for the TPM SHA1 PCR bank
    anymore.
  * All keys in the mkosi config JSON output are now in pascal case,
    except for credentials and environments, where the keys encode names
    of credentials and environment variables and are therefore case
    sensitive.
  * Added various settings to allow running mkosi behind a proxy.
  * Various fixes to kernel module filtering that should result in fewer
    modules being pulled into the default initrd when
    KernelModulesExclude= or KernelModulesInitrdExclude= are used.
  * Added ToolsTreeDistribution= match.
  * Removed vmspawn verb and replaced it with VirtualMachineMonitor=.
  * New specifiers for various directories were added. %D resolves to
    the directory that mkosi was invoked in, %P to the current working
    directory, and %C to the parent directory of the config file.
  * Added ForwardJournal= to have systemd inside a container/VM forward
    its journal to the specified file or directory.
    Systemd scopes are now allocated for qemu, swtpm, virtiofsd and
    systemd-journal-remote if available.
  * The mkosi qemu virtual machine is now registered with
    systemd-machined if available.
  * Added new oci output format
  * Runtime trees without a target are now mounted to /root/src instead
    of a subdirectory of it (To have the same behaviour as
    BuildSources=).
  * Added RuntimeBuildSources= to mount build and source directories
    when booting the image with mkosi nspawn or mkosi qemu.
    Introduced --append to allow command line settings to be parsed
    after parsing configuration files.
  * distribution-release is not installed by default anymore on
    OpenSUSE.
  * Setting QemuSmp= to 0 will now make qemu use all available CPUs
  * Free page reporting and discard request processing are now enabled by
    default in VMs spawned by mkosi qemu.
  * Added ToolsTreeCertificates= to allow configuring whether to use
    certificates and keys from the tools tree (if one is used) or the
    host.
  * Added never for CacheOnly= to specify that repository metadata
    should always be refreshed.
  * Renamed the none option for CacheOnly= to auto.
  * Added ProxyExclude= to configure hostnames for which requests should
    not go through the configured proxy.
  * The default tools tree is now reused on incremental builds.
  * Added VolatilePackages= and InitrdVolatilePackages= to configure
    packages that should be installed after executing build scripts and
    which should not be cached when using Incremental=.
  * PackageDirectories= now has an associated default path
    mkosi.packages.
  * reprepro is now used to generate local apt repositories.
  * Support for BSD tar/cpio was dropped.
  * When both ExtraSearchPaths= and ToolsTree= are used, mkosi will
    now prefer running a binary found in ExtraSearchPaths= without the
    tools tree over running the binary from the tools tree. If a binary is
    not found in ExtraSearchPaths=, the tools tree is used instead.
  * An artifact directory is now made available when running scripts which
    can be used to pass around data between different scripts. mkosi will
    also look for microcode and initrds in the artifact directory under
    the io.mkosi.microcode and io.mkosi.initrd subdirectories.
  * Added Environment= match setting to check for environment variables
    defined with the Environment= setting.
  * The basesystem package is now always installed in Fedora and
    CentOS images instead of the filesystem package.
  * The qemu, shell and boot verbs do not automatically build the
    image anymore unless --force is specified.
  * SplitArtifacts= is now supported for the portable, sysext and
    confext outputs.
  * The WithDocs= option was implemented for pacman-based distributions.
  * The default Fedora release was bumped to 40.
  * QemuSwtpm= can now be used with QemuFirmware= set to linux or
    bios.
  * Added UnitProperties= to allow configure properties on the scopes
    generated by systemd-nspawn and systemd-run.
  * mkosi now only builds a single default tools tree per build using the
    settings from the last regular image that we'll build.
  * Configure scripts are now only executed for verbs which imply an image
    build and are executed with the tools tree instead of without it.
  * $QEMU_ARCHITECTURE is now set for configure scripts to easily allow
    scripts to figure out which qemu binary will be used to run qemu.
  * A file ID can now be specified for QemuDrives=. This allows adding
    multiple qemu drives that are backed by the same file.
  * mkosi doesn't fail anymore if images already exist when running
    mkosi build.
  * Image names from mkosi.images/ are now preferred over the specified
    image ID when determining the output filename to use for an image.
    --include now has a shorthand option -I.
  * The WITH_NETWORK environment variable is now passed to build and
    finalize scripts.
  * We now clamp mtimes to the specified source date epoch timestamp
    instead of resetting all mtimes. This means that we won't touch any
    mtimes that are already older than the given source date epoch
    timestamp.
  * Removed support for CentOS 8 Stream as it is now EOL.
  * The coredumpctl and journalctl verbs now operrate on the path
    specified in ForwardJournal= if one is set.
  * Added UnifiedKernelImageFormat= format setting to allow configuring
    the naming of unified kernel images generated by mkosi.
  * The versionlock plugin is now enabled by default for dnf with a noop
    configuration.
  * Repositories= is now implemented for zypper.
  * KernelModulesInclude= and KernelModulesInitrdInclude= now take the
    special values host and default to include the host's loaded
    modules and the default kernel modules defined in mkosi-initrd
    respectively.
  * KernelModulesIncludeHost= and KernelModulesInitrdIncludeHost= are
    now deprecated.
  * Added mkosi dependencies to output the list of packages required by
    mkosi to build and boot images.
