  <title>Check whether BIND is running and to get the performance data via rndc stats</title>
  <description>check_bind.sh is a Nagios plugin to check the bind daemon whether it's running
via its pid file and then gets the statistics via rndc stats. The user that run
the script needs the ability to 'sudo rndc stats'! The timeframe in which the
rndc stats output is updated is controlled by the check interval. The output
shows amount of requests of various types occured during the last check
interval. The script itself is written sh-compliant and free software under the
terms of the GPLv2 (or later).
