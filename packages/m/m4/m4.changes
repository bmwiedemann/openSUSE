Wed May 14 10:43:08 UTC 2025 - Friedrich Haubensak <hsk17@mail.de>

- Drop -std=gnu17 from CFLAGS as 1.4.20 supports C23

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 10 20:00:23 UTC 2025 - Christoph G <foss@grueninger.de>

- Update to 1.4.20
 * Fix a bug in the `eval' builtin where it does not suppress warnings
   about division by zero that occurs within a more complex expression on
   the right hand side of || or &&
 * The `syscmd' and `esyscmd' builtins no longer mishandle a command line
   starting with `-' or `+'
 * Fix regression introduced in 1.4.19 where trace output (such as with
   `debugmode(t)') could read invalid memory when tracing a series of
   pushed macros that are popped during argument collection.
 * Fix regression introduced in 1.4.19 where the `format' builtin
   inadvertently took on locale-dependent parsing and output of floating
   point numbers as a side-effect of introducing message translations.
 * Fix regression introduced in 1.4.11 where the experimental `changeword'
   builtin could cause a crash if given a regex that does not match all
   one-byte prefixes of valid longer matches.  As a reminder, `changeword'
   is not recommended for production use, and will likely not be present
   in the next major version release.
** Update to comply with newer C standards, and inherit portability
   improvements from gnulib.
- Update to 1.4.19
** A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib, including
   the ability to perform stack overflow detection on more platforms
   without linking to GNU libsigsegv.
** The symbol hash table now defaults to 65537 buckets instead of 509, as
   modern systems have enough memory to benefit from fewer hash collisions
   by default.
** Introduce the use of gettext, with the immediate benefit of nicer
   UTF-8 author names.
- Disable profilied built as it lead to segmentation faults in the
  test suite (test-free).

 * Fix regressions in the `index' builtin.  On glibc platforms, this
   avoids false positives from a strstr bug in glibc 2.9 through 2.12;
   on many other platforms, it fixes two separate regressions, a false
   positive introduced in 1.4.11 and a false negative in 1.4.15.

  + Fix regression introduced in 1.4.9b where the `format' builtin
    could crash on an invalid format string.
  + Fix compilation against newer glibc, and on AIX 7.1BETA.
  + A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib.
- Changes from version 1.4.14:
  + Fix regression introduced in 1.4.12 where executing with stdout
    closed could crash m4 on exit on some platforms.
  + Fix regressions introduced in 1.4.13 in the `esyscmd' builtin,
    where closed file descriptors could interfere with child
    execution, and where a child status of 127 made m4 print a
    spurious message to stderr.
  + Fix a security hole in 'make dist', present since at least M4
    1.4, that could affect anybody attempting to redistribute
    modified sources (see Automake CVE-2009-4029).
  + A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib.
- Remove hacks from prep changing permissions: they're not needed
  anymore.
- Remove lzma BuildRequires as the source is bz2 now.
- Remove AutoReqProv: it's default now.
- Use %configure and %makeinstall macros.
- Drop m4-1.4.13.diff: it doesn't seem to be needed (some parts are
  upstream, at least), and it's not documented at all, so let's try
  without it.

Wed May 20 18:24:57 CEST 2009 - puzel@suse.cz

- Update to m4 1.4.13 
  ** The manual is now distributed under the terms of FDL 1.3.
  ** The `divert' and `undivert' builtins have been made more efficient
     when using temporary files for large diversions.
  ** The `translit' builtin has been made more efficient when the second
     argument is short.
  ** The input engine has been optimized for faster processing.
  ** The command line option `--debugfile', introduced in 1.4.7, now
     treats its argument as optional, in order to allow setting the debug
     output back to stderr when used without an argument; and order is now
     significant with respect to command line files.  You must therefore use
     `m4 --debugfile=trace file', not `m4 file --debugfile trace'.  This
     change does not affect the deprecated `-o'/`--error-output' option.
  ** The `syscmd' and `esyscmd' builtins can be configured to use an
     alternate shell, via the new `configure' option `--with-syscmd-shell'.
  ** A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 11 21:08:03 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.12.
  ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.4b where using `traceon' could delete
     a macro.  This was most noticeable with `traceon(`traceon')', but
     would also happen in cases such as `foo(traceon(`foo'))'.
  ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.7 where `m4 -N9' died with an assertion
     failure.
  ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.11 where `defn' died with an assertion
     failure on a traced but undefined macro.
  ** New `-g'/`--gnu' command-line option overrides `-G'/`--traditional'.
     For now, the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT has no effect on M4
     behavior; but a future release of M4 will behave as though --traditional
     is implied if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set (this future change is necessary,
     because in the current release, there is no way to disable GNU
     extensions that conflict with POSIX without the use of a non-POSIX
     command-line argument).  Clients of M4 that want to use GNU extensions,
     even when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, should start using the -g command-line
     argument, even though it is currently a no-op if -G did not appear
     earlier in the command line, so that the client will not break in the
     face of an upgraded m4 and a POSIXLY_CORRECT execution environment.
  ** The `-L'/`--nesting-limit' command-line option now defaults to 0 for
     unlimited on platforms that can detect and deal with stack overflow.  On
     systems that lack alternate stack support, such as Cygwin, and on
     systems that do not obey the POSIX semantics for distinguishing stack
     overflow from other exceptions, such as Linux, you can optionally
     install the libsigsegv library (version 2.6 or newer recommended) to
     enhance m4's ability to accurately report stack overflow:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  3 10:32:47 CEST 2008 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.11.
  ** Security fixes for the -F option, for bugs present since -F was
     introduced in 1.3: Avoid core dump with 'm4 -F file -t undefined', and
     avoid arbitrary code execution with certain file names.
  ** Fix regression introduced in 1.4.9b in the `divert' builtin when more
     than 512 kibibytes are saved in diversions on platforms like NetBSD
     or darwin where fopen(name,"a+") seeks to the end of the file.
  ** The output of the `maketemp' and `mkstemp' builtins is now quoted if a
     file was created.  This is a minor security fix, because it was possible
     (although rather unlikely) that an unquoted string could match an
     existing macro name, such that use of the `mkstemp' output would trigger
     inadvertent macro expansion and operate on the wrong file name.
  ** Enhance the `defn' builtin to support concatenation of multiple text
     arguments, as required by POSIX.  However, at this time, it is not
     possible to concatenate a builtin macro with anything else; a warning is
     now issued if this is attempted, although a future version of M4 may
     lift this restriction to match other implementations.
  ** Enhance the `format' builtin to parse all C99 floating point numbers,
     even on platforms where strtod(3) is buggy, although the replacement
     function does have the known issue of rounding errors when parsing
     some decimal floating point values.  This fixes testsuite failures
     introduced in 1.4.9b.
  ** Enhance the `index' builtin to guarantee linear behavior, in spite of
     the surprisingly large number of systems with a brain-dead quadratic
     strstr(3).
  ** A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 26 13:24:51 CET 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Remove broken tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 10 13:55:30 CEST 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.10.
  * Upgrade from GPL version 2 to GPL version 3 or later.
  * A number of portability improvements inherited from gnulib.
  * Avoid undefined behavior introduced in 1.4.9b in the `format' builtin
    when handling %c.  However, this area of code has never been documented,
    and currently does not match the POSIX behavior of printf(1), so it may
    have further changes in the next version.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 23 23:31:50 CET 2007 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.9.
  * Minor documentation and portability cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  4 11:13:03 CET 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.8.
  * The `divert' macro and `-H'/`--hashsize' command line option no longer
    cause a core dump when handed extra large values.  Also, `divert' now
    uses memory proportional to the number of diversions in use, rather than
    to the maximum diversion number encountered, so that large diversion
    numbers are less likely to exhaust system memory; and is no longer
    limited by the maximum number of file descriptors.
  * The `--help' and `--version' command line options now consistently
    override all earlier options.  For example, `m4 --debugfile=trace
    --help' now no longer accidentally creates an empty file `trace'.
  * The `-L'/`--nesting-limit' command line option can now be set to 0
    to remove the default limit of 1024.  However, it is still possible that
    heavily nested input can cause abrupt program termination due to stack
    overflow.
  * Problems encountered when writing to standard error, such as with the
    `errprint' macro, now always cause a non-zero exit status.
  * Warnings and errors issued during macro expansion are now consistently
    reported at the line where the macro name was detected, rather than
    where the close parenthesis resides.  Text wrapped by `m4wrap' now
    remembers the location that was in effect when m4wrap was invoked,
    rather than changing to line 0 and the empty string for a file.  The
    macros `__line__' and `__file__' now work correctly even as the last
    token in an included file.
  * The `builtin' and `indir' macros now transparently handle builtin
    tokens generated by `defn'.
  * When diversions created by the `divert' macro collect enough text that
    M4 must use temporary files, the environment variable $TMPDIR is now
    consulted, and a better effort is made to clean up those files in the
    event of a fatal signal.
  * The `mkstemp' builtin is added with the same GNU semantics as `maketemp',
    based on the recommendation of POSIX to deprecate the POSIX semantics of
    `maketemp' as inherently insecure.  In GNU mode (no -G supplied on the
    command line), `maketemp' silently retains the secure GNU semantics, but
    a future release of M4 will change this to emit a warning.  In
    traditional mode (m4 -G), `maketemp' now uses the POSIX-mandated insecure
    semantics, and issues a warning that you should convert your script to
    use `mkstemp' instead.  Additionally, `mkstemp' and `maketemp' are now
    well-defined even if the template argument does not end in six `X'
    characters.
  * The manual has been improved, including a new section on a composite
    macro `foreach'.
  * The `changecom' and `changequote' macros now treat an empty second
    argument the same as if it were missing, rather than using the empty
    string and making it impossible to end a comment or quote.
  * The `translit' macro now operates in linear instead of quadratic time,
    and is now eight-bit clean.
  * The `-D', `-U', `-s', and `-t' command line options now take effect
    after any files encountered earlier on the command line, rather than up
    front, as is done in traditional implementations and required by POSIX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 25 15:39:25 CEST 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.6.
  * Fix regression from 1.4.5 in handling a file that ends in a macro
    expansion without arguments instead of a newline.
  * The define and pushdef macros now warn when the first argument is not
    a string, rather than silently doing nothing.
  * Standard input can now be read more than once, as in 'm4 - file -', and
    is not closed until all wrapped text is handled.  This makes a
    difference when stdin is not a regular file, and also fixes bugs when
    using the syscmd or esyscmd macros from wrapped text.
  * When standard input is a seekable file, the m4exit, syscmd, and esyscmd
    macros now restore the current position to the next unread byte rather
    than discarding an arbitrary amount of buffered data.
  * SysV command-line compatibility is no longer a goal of GNU M4; the
    focus will be instead on POSIX compatibility.  This release continues to
    support previous usage, but adds warnings in areas which will allow a
    future version of GNU M4 to use its own extensions without being tied to
    the SysV command line interface.
  * The no-op compatibility command line options -B, -N, -S, -T, and
    --diversions may be withdrawn or assigned new meanings in future
    releases, so they now issue a warning if used.
  * A new command line option -i replaces the compatibility -e as the
    short spelling of --interactive, for consistency with other GNU tools; a
    warning is issued if the old spelling is used, and it may be assigned new
    meaning in future releases.
  * A new command line option --debugfile replaces the options -o and
    --error-output as the preferred spelling.  The old options were
    misleading in their names and inconsistent with other GNU tools; they are
    still silently accepted, but no longer documented in --help, and may be
    assigned new meanings in future releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 26 09:20:43 CEST 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.6.
  * Fix buffer overruns in regexp and patsubst macros when handed a trailing
    backslash in the replacement text, or when handling \n substitutions
    beyond the number of \(\) groups.
  * Fix memory leak in regexp, patsubst, and changeword macros.
  * The format macro now understands %F, %g, and %G.
  * When loading frozen files, m4 now exits with status 63 if version
    mismatch is detected.
  * Fix bugs that occurred when invoked with stdout or stderr closed,
    and detect write failures to stdout or to the target of the
    debugfile macro.  In particular, the syscmd and esyscmd macros can
    no longer interfere with the debug stream or diversions.
  * The m4exit macro now converts values outside the range 0-255 to 1.
  * It is now an error if a command-line input file ends in the middle of a
    comment, matching the behavior of mid-string and mid-argument
    collection.
  * The dnl macro now warns if end of file is encountered instead of a
    newline.
  * The error message when end of file is encountered now uses the file and
    line where the dangling construct started, rather than `NONE:0:'.
  * The debugmode and __file__ macros, and the -s/--synclines option, now
    show what directory a file was found in when the -I/--include option or
    M4PATH variable had an effect.
  * The changequote and changecom macros now work with 8-bit characters, and
    quotes and comments that begin with `(' are properly recognized
    following a word.
  * The new macro __program__ is added, which allows the input file to issue
    an error message that resembles messages from m4.  Warning and error
    messages have been reformatted to comply with GNU Coding Standards.
  * The errprint, m4wrap, and shift macros are now recognized only with
    arguments.
  * The index, substr, translit, regexp, and patsubst macros now produce
    output when given only one argument, but still warn about a missing
    second argument.
  * The patsubst macro now reliably finds zero-length matches at the end
    of a string.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 17 13:30:00 CEST 2006 - schwab@suse.de

- Update to m4 1.4.5.
  * Fix sysval on BeOS, OS/2, and other systems that store exit status
    in the low-order byte.  Additionally, on Unix platforms, if syscmd was
    terminated by a signal, sysval now displays the signal number shifted
    left by eight bits, to match traditional m4 implementations.
  * The maketemp macro is no longer subject to platform limitations (such as
    26 or 32 max files from a given template).
  * Frozen files now require that the first directive be V (version), to
    better diagnose version mismatch.  Additionally, if the F directive
    (builtin function) names an unknown builtin that existed in the m4 that
    froze the file but not in the current m4 (for example, changeword), the
    warning is deferred until an attempt is made to actually use the
    builtin.  This allows downgrading from beta m4-1.4o to stable m4-1.4.5
    without breaking autoconf.
  * The format and indir macros are now recognized only with arguments.
  * The eval macro no longer crashes on x86 architectures when dividing the
    minimum integer by -1.
  * On systems with ecvt and fcvt, format no longer truncates trailing
    zeroes on integers printed with %.0f.  On systems without these
    functions, format is no longer subject to a buffer overflow that
    permitted arbitrary code execution.
  * On native Windows builds, the macro __windows__ is provided instead of
    __unix__.  Likewise, on OS/2 builds, the macro __os2__ is provided.  This
    allows input files to determine when syscmd might behave differently.
  * Fix bug in 1.4.3 patch to use \n line-endings that did not work for
    cygwin.
  * When given the empty string or 0, undivert is now documented as a no-op
    rather than closing stdout, warning about a non-existent file, or trying
    to read a directory as a file.
  * Many documentation improvements.  Also, the manual is now distributed
    under FDL 1.2, rather than a stricter verbatim-only license.
  * Raise the -L (--nesting-limit) command line option limit from 250 to
    1024.
  * The decr, incr, divert, m4exit, and substr macros treat an empty number
    as 0, issue a warning, and expand as normal; rather than issuing an error
    and expanding to the empty string.
  * The eval macro now treats an empty radix argument as 10, handles radix 1,
    and treats the width argument as number of digits excluding the sign,
    for compatibility with other m4 implementations.
  * The ifdef, divert, m4exit, substr, and translit macros now correctly
    ignore extra arguments.
  * The popdef and undefine macros now correctly accept multiple arguments.
  * Although changeword is on its last leg, if enabled, it now reverts to the
    default (faster) regexp when passed the empty string.
  * The regexp and substr macros now warn and ignore a trailing backslash in
    the replacement, and warn on \n for n larger than the number of
    sub-expressions in the regexp.
  * Fix a recursive push_string crashing bug, which affected changequote of
    three or more characters on some compilers.
  * Use automake to fix build portability issues.
  * Fix a recursive m4wrap crashing bug.
  * Fix a 1 in 2**32 hash crashing bug.
  * Tracing a macro by name is now persistent, even if the macro is
    subsequently undefined or redefined.  The traceon and traceoff macros no
    longer warn about undefined symbols.  This solves a crash when using
    indir on an undefined macro traced with the -t option, as well as an
    incorrect result of ifdef.  Furthermore, tracing is no longer transferred
    with builtins, solving the bug of "m4 -tm4_eval" failing to give trace
    output on the input "define(`m4_eval',defn(`eval'))m4_eval(1)".
  * Fix a crash when a macro is undefined while collecting its arguments, by
    always using the definition that was in effect before argument
    collection.  This behavior matches the C pre-processor, and means that
    the sequence "define(`f',`1')f(define(`f',`2'))f" is now documented to
    result in "12", rather than the previously undocumented "22".
  * Update the regex engine to fix several bugs.
  * Fix a potential crash on machines where char is signed.
