  <title>Voice Communication Client for Gamers</title>
  <description>Low-latency, high-quality voice communication for gamers. Includes game
linking, so voice from other players comes from the direction of their
characters, and has echo cancellation so the sound from your loudspeakers
won't be audible to other players.</description>
