- Add 0001-fix-security-bugs.patch to fix CVE-2019-18359 and other
  crashes. boo#1154971
- Update to version 1.6.2
- Dropped mp3gain-1.6.1-libmpg123_fixup.patch,
  mp3gain-1.6.1-fix_warnings.patch and
  mp3gain-1.6.1-fix-CVE-2017-12911.patch (merged upstream)
- Added mp3gain-1.6.1-fix-CVE-2017-12911.patch
- Dropped mp3gain-makefile-optflags.diff (no longer necessary)
- Replaced mp3gain-exit_if_cannot_parse.patch with
  mp3gain-1.6.1-libmpg123_fixup.patch and
  mp3gain-implicit_declarations.patch with 
  mp3gain-1.6.1-fix_warnings.patch
- Refreshed mp3gain.1.gz
- Update to version 1.6.1
  * Link to current libmpg123 instead of the hacked old version
    thereof
- Drop gpl-2.0.txt as source (package can be shipped as lgpl2.1+
  now)
- Add mp3gain-implicit_declarations.patch
- Add mp3gain-exit_if_cannot_parse.patch (hotfix)
- Set correct license (GPL-2.0+) and replaced source2 with its
  text instead
- Cleaned up buildrequires

- extracted missing manpage from
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mp3gain/mp3gain_1.5.2-r2-2_amd64.deb
- added this new LICENSE file because of this warning:
mp3gain.x86_64: W: incorrect-fsf-address /usr/share/doc/packages/mp3gain/lgpl.txt
The Free Software Foundation address in this file seems to be outdated or
misspelled.  Ask upstream to update the address, or if this is a license file,possibly the entire file with a new copy available from the FSF. 
- new upstream version 1.5.2-r2 
 
- new upstream version 1.5.2
