- Update to version 0.5.1.
  * Newman radius of atom to draw Newman-type projections.
  * New tools for aligning, spacing, and cleaning up molecules.
  * Better encapsulate calls to OpenBabel to avoid crashes.
  * Several fixes to qmake/cmake installation of files (including
    MIME types).
- Drop molsketch-cmake-incorrect-file-loc.patch: incorporated
  upstream.
- Use rsvg-convert instead of inkscape for the svg-to-png
  conversion of icons; reduces the large number of build
  dependencies otherwise required for inkscape alone.
- Only run post(un) scriptlets for openSUSE <= 1320; for newer
  openSUSE these are automatically taken care of by rpm triggers;
  where applicable also run mime_database_post(un) as part of
  these scriptlets since molsketch now installs a mime file.

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  * Change log displayed on startup.
  * Lone pairs and radical electrons.
  * Selection by type (not yet really useful as properties are
    usually edited only for single items).
  * Querying Wikidata for chemical structures (requires
    OpenBabel and InChI support).
- Add molsketch-cmake-incorrect-file-loc.patch: Fix cmake install
  command looking for files in molsketch/src/* whereas they have
  been moved to molsketch/* already
- Build against Qt5 unconditionally (the minimum Qt5 is available
  across all supported openSUSE versions).
- Adapt file list for update: include files no longer installed

    support, which was previously only possible with qmake.
  * Legacy stereo bonds (from files created with versions prior to
    Lithium) are now imported correctly.
- Use inkscape to build hicolor png icons from bundled svg image
  and install then all.
- Run post install scripts to update desktop database and hicolor
  icon theme.
- Run spec-cleaner for a clean-up.
