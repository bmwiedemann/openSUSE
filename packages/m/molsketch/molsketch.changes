  * Atom shape can also be a circle instead of a rectangle
  * Bitmap export with adjustable resolution
  * Support OpenBabel 3
  * Fixes for sum formula and molecule tooltip
  * Fix clipping of bonds
  * Fixed OpenBabel support
- Add fix-compilation.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 12:13:41 UTC 2020 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.6.0:
  * Levels on which items are drawn are accessible; bonds are
    indicated to cover other bonds if on higher level
  * Broken bond indicator with same color as rest of bond
  * Show sum formula of molecule during hover and after selection
  * Closable wiki query
  * Improved performance for drag-and-drop insertion of molecules
  * Associated *.msm files with Molsketch

    molecule, bonds, atoms)
  * Fixed global preferences (accidentally had no effect)
  * Fixed number of hydrogens and charge in saving/loading
    molecules
- Update options passed to cmake to keep up with upstream changes;
  omit MSK_INSTALL_LIBS specification entrirely since specifying
  it leads to installation of *.so into a subdir for x86_64 and
  directly into %{_lib} for i586.
- Force ascii mode when using dos2unix.
- Drop conditionals for obsolete openSUSE versions.
- Drop shared lib package: versioned shared libraries are no
  longer installed, so everything is packaged in -devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 10:16:56 UTC 2020 - Max Lin <mlin@suse.com>

- Leap 15.2 and SLE15 SP2 has newer librsvg, extend the conditional
  for "BuildRequires: rsvg-convert"

Wed Oct 23 17:28:57 CEST 2019 - ro@suse.de

- fix build-requires for factory/tumbleweed
  rsvg-convert tool is now in rsvg-convert package 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  9 15:13:28 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.5.1.
  * Newman radius of atom to draw Newman-type projections.
  * New tools for aligning, spacing, and cleaning up molecules.
  * Better encapsulate calls to OpenBabel to avoid crashes.
  * Several fixes to qmake/cmake installation of files (including
    MIME types).
- Drop molsketch-cmake-incorrect-file-loc.patch: incorporated
  upstream.
- Use rsvg-convert instead of inkscape for the svg-to-png
  conversion of icons; reduces the large number of build
  dependencies otherwise required for inkscape alone.
- Only run post(un) scriptlets for openSUSE <= 1320; for newer
  openSUSE these are automatically taken care of by rpm triggers;
  where applicable also run mime_database_post(un) as part of
  these scriptlets since molsketch now installs a mime file.

    OpenBabel and InChI support).
- Add molsketch-cmake-incorrect-file-loc.patch: Fix cmake install
  command looking for files in molsketch/src/* whereas they have
