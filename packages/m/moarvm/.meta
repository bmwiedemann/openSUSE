  <title>A virtual machine built especially for Rakudo Perl 6</title>
  <description>
Short for &quot;Metamodel On A Runtime&quot;, MoarVM is a virtual machine built
especially for Rakudo Perl 6 and the NQP Compiler Toolchain.
MoarVM is a backend for NQP. MoarVM already stands out amongst the
various Rakudo and NQP compilation targets by typically:

- Running the Perl 6 specification test suite fastest
- Having the lowest memory usage
- Having the best startup time
- Being fastest to build both NQP and Rakudo - and thus in theory your Perl 6 and NQP programs too!
