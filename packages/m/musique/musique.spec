%description
Musique is a music player designed by and for people that love
music. Musique does its best to stay out the way and keep you
focused on the only thing that really matters: Music.
You need to try it to really get it.
To set expectations right â€” Musique is not about podcasts or
internet radio; it's not about managing mobile devices and it has
no integrated music store.
It's about listening to beautiful music.
