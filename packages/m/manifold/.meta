  <description>Manifold is a geometry library dedicated to creating and operating on manifold
triangle meshes. A manifold mesh is a mesh that represents a solid object, and
so is very important in manufacturing, CAD, structural analysis, etc. Manifold
also supports arbitrary vertex properties and enables mapping of materials for
rendering use-cases. Our primary goal is reliability: guaranteed manifold
output without caveats or edge cases. Our secondary goal is performance:
efficient algorithms that make extensive use of parallelization, or pipelining
when only a single thread is available.</description>
