Fri Feb 27 10:20:23 UTC 2026 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 3.4.0
  This is a major release with many bug fixes, performance
  improvements, updates to the TypeScript API, and ManifoldCAD.
  Notable changes:

  - Added MinkowskiSum and MinkowskiDifference, but note that the
    current implementation performs many union operations. It may
    be slow and memory-intensive for complex meshes.
  - MeshIO is removed from our public API. Users should use
    libraries such as Trimesh for Python and assimp for C++. The
    MeshIO code is still available as an example for interfacing
    with assimp.
  - ManifoldCAD can now import and operate on glTF models! It can
    also display 2D CrossSections and non-manifold imports. The
    documentation is also vastly improved, for both ManifoldCAD
    scripts, and the underlying TS API for those wanting to build
    their own tool.

  For all the details see:

- Update to 3.3.0
  The big theme of this release is a major expansion of our npm
  module to now expose the script-runner of ManifoldCAD.org to any
  Node project or website that wants to use it. It even comes in a
  CLI flavor now that you can use like npx manifold-cad. There have
  been a number of breaking changes to ManifoldCAD.org scripts,
  primarily that the classes now need to be explicitly imported and
  the results explicitly exported. However, now we can import
  libraries universally, from node installs, from CDNs, and even
  from local scripts you write on ManifoldCAD.org! A huge thank you
  to @tonious for making all this happen.
