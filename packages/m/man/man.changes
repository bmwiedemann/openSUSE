-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  8 13:58:23 UTC 2024 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Drop libzio integration (man-db-2.7.1-zio.dif, BuildRequires and flag)
  to restore acceptable performance (boo#1232837):

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 18 13:04:09 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to man-db 2.13.0 (29 August 2024)
  * Drop support for versions of groff before 1.21 (released on 2010-12-31).
  * Fix `man-suffixed-extension` test failure when not using the GNU
    hierarchy organization.
  * Fix `-Wmissing-variable-declarations` warnings with GCC 14.
  * Fix `-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end` warning with GCC 14.
  * Upgrade to Gnulib `stable-202407`.
  * Support running the test suite against an installed package; this is
    useful for systems such as Debian's autopkgtest framework.
- Remove patch man-db-2.6.3-chinese.dif as not supported anymore
  due to newer groff versions
- Port patches
  * man-db-2.6.3-listall.dif
  * man-db-2.7.1-zio.dif
  * man-db-2.9.4.patch
  * man-propose-online.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  4 08:10:47 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 2.12.1 (5 April 2024)
  * Fix excessive cleanup of `/var/cache/man` by `systemd-tmpfiles`.
  * `man` matches the display width more accurately to the configured width.
  * Upgrade to Gnulib `stable-202401`.
  * Mention `groff`'s `pdf` device in `man(1)`.
  * Speed up `seccomp` filter slightly.
  * Document how to format pages using italic rather than underlined text.
  * Remove the obsolete `chconfig` tool for converting man-db configuration
    files to the FHS.  This transition took place almost 25 years ago (at
    least in Debian), so it's not worth keeping it around now.
- Remove patch man-db-2.9.4-alternitive.dif now upstream
- Port the patches
  * man-db-2.6.3-listall.dif
  * man-db-2.7.1-zio.dif
  * man-db-2.9.4.patch
  * man-propose-online.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 07:21:59 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 09:32:21 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 26 09:26:57 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Skip posttrans dependency on systemd to support container without
  systemd (boo#1215538)
- Use %(trans)filetriggerin and %(trans)filetriggerpostun to get
  an uptodate man database for installed manual pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 12:19:14 UTC 2023 - Antonio Teixeira <antonio.teixeira@suse.com>

- Update to 2.12.0:
  * Fix some manual page portability issues with groff 1.23.0.
  * Fix test failures when a working `iconv` is not available.
  * Ensure that timestamps read from the database can go past the year 2038,
    even on systems where this is not the default.
  * Fix `manpath` not parsing `PATH` entries with trailing slash correctly
    for guessing `MANPATH` entries.
  * More accurately document the behaviour of passing file names as arguments
    to `man` without the `-l`/`--local-file` option.
  * Avoid duplicate cleanup of old cat pages by both `man-db.service` and
    `systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service`.
  Improvements:
  * Update system call lists in `seccomp` sandbox from `systemd`.
  * Upgrade to Gnulib `stable-202307`.
  * Work around the Firebuild accelerator in `seccomp` sandbox: if this is in
    use then we need to allow some socket-related system calls.
  * `man -K` now deduplicates search results that point to the same page.
  * Warn if `mandb` drops to `--user-db` mode due to running as the wrong
    user.
  * Change section title recommendations in `man(1)` to mention `STANDARDS`
    rather than `CONFORMING TO`, in line with `man-pages(7)`.
  * Add a `STANDARDS` section to `man(1)` itself.
  * Document that `man -K` may suffer from false negatives as well as false
    positives.
  * Take advantage of newer `groff` facilities to implement `man
    --no-hyphenation` and `man --no-justification`, if available.
  * `man -f` and `man -k` now pass any `-r`/`--regex` or `-w`/`--wildcard`
    options on to `whatis` and `apropos` respectively.
  * Always pass a line length to `nroff`, even if we believe that it matches
    the default.
  * Allow disabling `groff` warnings via `man --warnings`, by prefixing a
    warning name with `!`.
- Drop man-db-groff-1.23.0-warnings.patch
- Refresh man-db-2.9.4.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  8 19:48:53 UTC 2023 - Antonio Teixeira <antonio.teixeira@suse.com>

- Add man-db-groff-1.23.0-warnings.patch
  * Fix build errors with groff 1.23.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 26 12:20:42 UTC 2023 - Avinesh Kumar <avinesh.kumar@suse.com>

- Fix the content in patch file man-propose-online.patch 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 15 09:31:32 UTC 2023 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 2.11.2:
  * Fix compile and test failures when `troff` is not `groff`.
  * Fix segfault in typical uses of `man` when `nroff` is not installed.
  * Fix crash in `mandb` when processing stray cats.
  * SECURITY: Replace `$` characters in page names with `?` when constructing
    `less` prompts.
  * Silence error message when processing an empty manual page hierarchy with
    a nonexistent cache directory.
  * `man(1)` now sorts whatis references below real pages, even if the whatis
    references are from a section with higher priority.
  * `mandb` now correctly records filters in the database if it uses cached
    whatis information.
  * Upgrade Gnulib, fixing syntax error on glibc systems with GCC 11.
  * The `CATWIDTH` configuration file directive now overrides `MINCATWIDTH`
    and `MAXCATWIDTH`.
  * Database entries for links were often incorrectly stored as if they were
    entries for the ultimate source of the page.  They are now stored with
    the correct type.
  * Store links in the database using the section and extension of the link
    rather than of the ultimate source file.
  * Consider pages for adding to the database even if they seem to already
    exist; this performance optimization is no longer needed due to caching,
    and it produced inconsistent results in some unusual cases.
  * `man` now runs any required preprocessors in the same order that `groff`
    does, rather than trusting the order of filters in a page's preprocessor
    string.
  * Fix building on MinGW.  (I haven't been able to test this; help from
    MinGW experts would be welcome.)
  Improvements:
  * Check for stray cats even if no manual pages in a given manpath were
    changed.
  * Add section `3type` to the default section list just after `2`.  This is
    used by the Linux man-pages package.
  * Recognize more Hungarian translations of the `NAME` section.
  * Add more recognized case variants for localized versions of the `NAME`
    section.
  * Maintain multi keys in sorted order, improving database reproducibility.
  * Pick a more consistent name for the target of a whatis entry in the
    database.
  * Extend rules for when to replace one database entry with another,
    producing more stable behaviour.
  * Fully reorganize databases after writing them, allowing the reproduction
    of bitwise-identical databases regardless of scan order (at least with
    GDBM).
- Port patches
  * man-db-2.6.3-chinese.dif

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 22 21:17:21 UTC 2022 - Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.10.2:
  * Regenerating man-db's build system now explicitly requires Automake >=
    1.14.  (This was already the case since at least man-db 2.10.0, but was
    previously undocumented.)
  * Make `man -H` sleep for a few seconds after starting the browser, since
    it may background itself before loading files (Dr. Werner Fink).
  * If an override directory is configured using `--with-override-dir`, it is
    now applied more consistently when building the manpath, and whether a
    page was found in an override directory is considered when sorting
    candidates for display (Mihail Konev).
  * Make the man-db manual build reproducible.
  * Add some hardening options to the `systemd` service.
  * `configure` now has a `--with-snapdir` option, for use on systems where
    `snapd` is configured to use a directory other than `/snap`.
  * Fix occasional `mandb-symlink-target-timestamp` test failure.
  * Fix inadvertent reliance on a GCC extension that caused build failures
    with Clang.
  * Fix building without `iconv`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 18 08:14:54 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to man-db 2.10.0 (4 February 2022)
  * Manpath deduplication no longer mishandles the case where another entry
    in the manpath is a suffix of a candidate path to append.
  * Fix potential crash in path searching if `getcwd` fails for reasons other
    than running out of memory.
  * Fix crash in `globbing` test tool if run with no non-option arguments.
  * `lexgrog` now produces output in the user's locale.
  * Downgrade "malformed .lf request" warning to a debug message and rephrase
    it somewhat, since `.lf` requests can use `*roff` arithmetic expressions
    and we can't reasonably parse those.
  * Avoid modifying the database without changing its mtime, which had been
    possible since 2.7.0 if `mandb`'s purge phase found work to do but the
    main phase didn't, and which confused some backup systems into reporting
    possible filesystem corruption.
  * `man` no longer inadvertently modifies the `MANSECT` environment variable
    before passing it on to its subprocesses.
  * `mandb` now stores the mtime of link targets as the mtime of their
    corresponding database entries, rather than sometimes storing the mtime
    of the link instead.
  * Since man-db 2.4.2, `man` has behaved as if the `-l` option was given if
    a manual page argument contains a slash.  Since man-db 2.5.6, this has
    interacted slightly poorly with the subpage feature, emitting spurious
    error messages if given multiple manual page arguments some of which
    include a slash.  `man` no longer emits spurious error messages in this
    case.
  * Reduce overhead of `MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP=1` compared to building without
    `libseccomp`.
  * Document `MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP` and `PIPELINE_DEBUG` environment variables
    in `man(1)`.
  * Add `man-pages(7)` reference to `man(1)`.
  * Recognize Arabic and Persian translations of the `NAME` section.
  * Delay the `systemd` timer using `RandomizedDelaySec`, so that multiple
    containers/VMs on the same host are less prone to running `mandb` all at
    the same time.
  * Significantly improve `mandb(8)` and `man -K` performance in the common
    case where pages are of moderate size and compressed using `zlib`: `mandb
    -c` goes from 344 seconds to 10 seconds on a test system.

Mon May 31 19:07:16 UTC 2021 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 2.9.4:
  * Add support for zstd-compressed manual pages
  * Recognise Esperanto, Romanian, Tamil, and Ukrainian translations
    of the NAME section.
  * Fix handling of \- in the right-hand side of a NAME section.
  * Treat "\[en]" (etc.) as another synonym for "\-" in NAME sections,
    alongside the existing "\(en" (etc.).
  * Avoid incorrect markup in man(1) with po4a >= 0.58.
  * Fix manual page translation infrastructure to compare po4a
    versions with more than two components correctly.
  * Fix "man -X75-12" and "man -X100-12" to set the document font
    size as well as the device
  * Fix incompatibility of "man -X" and friends with the seccomp
    sandbox.
  * man --recode and manconv now adjust encoding declarations on the
    first line of their input to refer to the new encoding.
  * There is a new "man-recode" program. Which has an interface
    designed for bulk conversion and so can be much faster when
    used on a large number of pages.
  * Fix comparison of candidate manual pages to correctly handle the
    case where the language elements are the same and match the
    locale, but the territory elements differ.
  * If run with no arguments or only a section, man now suggests
    running "man man".
  * man now understands the <page>(<section>) form on its command
    line, so for example "man 'chmod(2)'" is now the same as
    "man 2 chmod".
  * manconv now guesses the input encoding based on the file name
    if it is not explicitly specified.
  * Further workarounds for ESET File Security: allow sendmsg when
    it is in use.
  * If more than one of "../man", "man", "../share/man", and
    "share/man" exist relative to a directory on $PATH, then all of
    them are now added to the automatically-determined manpath
  * Remove arbitrary limit on manpath size.
  * Fix several resource and memory leaks.
  * Ship a systemd timer to perform daily database maintenance.
  * Fix segfaults in mandb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 26 11:37:32 UTC 2018 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to man-db 2.8.4
  * Major changes since man-db 2.8.3:
   + Rely on decompressors reading from their standard input rather
     than redundantly passing them the input file on their command
     line.  This works better with downstream AppArmor confinement of
     decompressors.
   + Fix invalid syntax in tmpfiles.d/man-db.conf when configured with
     --disable-cache-owner.
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow sched_getaffinity, sometimes used by
     xz.
   + Check for mandb_nfmt and mandb_tfmt in the manual page hierarchy
     as documented, not in the current directory.  This was broken by
     the working-directory-handling changes in 2.8.3.  Note that this
     change means that "man -l" will never use an external formatter
     (which was never documented behaviour and was surely a bad idea).
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow some shared memory operations across
     the board rather than just when ESET File Security is in use; the
     Astrill VPN seems to require something similar, and there are
     doubtless other such preload hacks.
   + Some versions of ESET File Security call msgget and msgsnd; if
     this program is in use, then allow those.
  * Major changes since man-db 2.8.2:
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow madvise, since that's used by lbzip2.
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow kill and tgkill outright, since groff
     uses kill to pass on signals to its child processes.
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow sibling architectures on
     x86/x86_64/x32, since people sometimes mix and match architectures
     there for performance reasons.
   + Fix version check in locale macro loading to tolerate groff
     release candidates.
   + man now only changes working directory in child processes, so
     never fails due to being unable to change back to its original
     working directory.
   + accessdb, apropos, and lexgrog no longer emit spurious gettext
     headers in their --help output when localised.
  * Major changes since man-db 2.8.1:
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow kill and tgkill when the signal is
     directed at the current process or one of its threads; this is
     needed by xz.
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow ioctl(fd, TIOCGWINSZ), since that's used
     by musl.
   + Work around the proprietary "ESET File Security" antivirus program in
     seccomp sandbox: if this is in use then we need to allow some
     socket-related system calls.
   + Work around the "snoopy" execve() wrapper and logger in seccomp
     sandbox: if this is in use then we need to allow some
     socket-related system calls.
   + Interpret EFAULT from seccomp_load as meaning that seccomp is
     unavailable, since this can be returned by some versions of
     qemu-user.
  * Major changes since man-db 2.8.0:
   + Fix seccomp sandbox build on Linux/POWER.
   + Fix manconv execution under seccomp when man is installed setuid.
   + Make seccomp sandbox allow mremap (used by iconv, for example).
   + configure now has a --without-libseccomp option to disable the use
     of seccomp even if the library is available.
  * Major changes since man-db 2.7.6.1:
   + Fix locale macro loading for Chinese to load the macro file
     corresponding to just the language part of the user's locale.
   + Honour --enable-cache-owner in generated systemd tmpfiles snippet
     rather than hardcoding "man".
   + If man adds prefixes to a page to handle such things as disabling
     hyphenation, then take account of those when looking for a
     preprocessor line at the start of the page.
   + Fix a segfault in 'man -D --help'.
   + Treat "\(en" as another synonym for "\-" in NAME sections.
   + Confine most subprocesses that handle untrusted data using
     seccomp.  This mainly deals with subprocesses that perform
     encoding conversions, (de)compressors, groff programs, and a few
     other odds and ends.  groff programs use a slightly more
     permissive filter since they need to create temporary files, so
     additional path-based confinement (e.g. using AppArmor) is still
     useful.
     If this goes wrong, then MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP=1 can be set in the
     environment to disable it, but please report any such problem as a
     bug.
   + man now falls back to cat if the compile-time default pager is not
     executable.
  * Major changes since man-db 2.7.6:
   + Don't chmod CACHEDIR.TAG if it doesn't exist.
   + Correct installation of Swedish manual pages.

- Update to version 2.7.1
  For the first time since version 2.4.0, the database format has
  changed slightly, so you will need to run 'mandb --create' after
  installing the new version to rebuild your databases from scratch.
- Fixes
  * Various portability fixes for Solaris, contributed by Peter Bray.
  * man now runs correctly when its current working directory has been
    deleted.  (As a result of this fix, man-db now requires
    libpipeline >= 1.4.0.)
  * 'man -a' sends its prompts to /dev/tty rather than to stderr, and
    likewise reads replies from /dev/tty rather than from stdin.
  * Be more careful to avoid using or double-closing closed database
    handles.  Fixes test suite failures on some systems.
  * Patch the fdutimens function imported from Gnulib to work around a
    libc bug in GNU/Hurd.
  * Fix test suite in the case where the system supports
    high-precision timestamps but the file system containing the build
    directory does not.
  * lexgrog now filters terminal escape sequences out of cat pages
    before trying to parse them.
  * Tools that consider the terminal line length now prioritise the
    COLUMNS environment variable above the TIOCGWINSZ ioctl.
  * Manpath elements are no longer canonicalised before being inserted
    into the search path; this caused the use of incorrect catpaths in
    some cases.  This was broken by the LANGUAGE-handling fixes in
    2.5.4.
  * Remove test suite dependency on realpath(1).
  * Fix a test failure when configured with --enable-undoc.
  * Run the pager in man's original working directory rather than in
    the manual hierarchy.  (As a result of this fix, man-db now
    requires libpipeline >= 1.3.0.)
  * mandb only creates a cache directory tag if the catpath is
    different from the manpath, since it should only be created in
    directories that consist entirely of cached information.
- Improvements
  * Ship a systemd tmpfiles snippet to clean up old cat files after a
    week.
  * The modification time of manual databases is now simply stored in
    the mtime of the database files themselves, rather than using a
    special row.  This makes databases reproducible between
    otherwise-identical installations, as long as the underlying
    database has predictable behaviour.  As a bonus, man-db now uses
    high-precision timestamps to determine whether it needs to update
    databases.
  * Timestamps of manual pages are also now stored in the database
    with high precision and compared accordingly.
  * Files are now ordered by first physical extent before reading
    them, for substantial performance improvements in operations such
    as mandb and 'man -K'.
  * 'man -H' shows a better error message if no browser is configured.
  * zsoelim is now installed in $pkglibexecdir, to avoid clashes with
    other packages.

- Update to version 2.6.6
- Fixes since 2.6.3:
  * man(1) and catman(8) now document the default section list set at
    configure time.
  * Build fixes for Automake 1.13.
  * man-db 2.6.0 arranged to search the full manpath when expanding
    .so directives in manual pages (so that ".so name.1" works as well
    as ".so man1/name.1"), but this incorrectly did not take effect
    for manual pages that consist only of a .so directive.  This is
    now fixed.
- Improvements since 2.6.3:
  * The MANLESS environment variable is now treated as if it were a
    default value for the -r option to man: occurrences of the text
    "$MAN_PN" are expanded, and explicitly using the -r option
    overrides the default.
  * The (unfortunately still hardcoded) maximum length for paths to
    manual page hierarchies in the configuration file is now 511
    characters rather than 49.
  * MANPATH entries now undergo glob(7)-style wildcard expansion,
    allowing entries such as "/opt/*/man".
- Fixes since 2.6.4:
  * man's --warnings option works again on systems with versions of
    groff that support it (broken in 2.6.4).
  * man automatically falls back to C.UTF-8 and then en_GB.UTF-8 if
    trying to find a UTF-8 locale on a system without
    /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED.
- Fixes since 2.6.5:
  * apropos's --and option now works again; it was broken by the
    optimisations in 2.6.2.
  * Restore compatibility with Automake 1.10.
  * Improve support for translation of common elements of help
    messages.
  * Don't issue error messages when the database refers to a page that
    no longer exists.
  * Pass macro and hyphenation language tags to groff again (broken in
    2.6.5).
- Improvements since 2.6.5:
  * ./configure --with-override-dir=OVERRIDE arranges to look for
    manual pages in DIR/OVERRIDE before each path element DIR.
- rebase following patches:
  * man-db-2.6.3.dif
  * man-db-2.6.3-security4.dif
  * man-db-2.6.3-firefox.dif
  * man-db-2.6.3-zio.dif

- Update to version 2.6.3
  * Build fixes for glibc 2.16 and Automake 1.12.
  * apropos prints an error message and returns non-zero when it finds
    no matches.  (Regression introduced in 2.5.1.)
  * The presence of a 64-bit GDBM database on the manpath no longer
    causes a 32-bit man process to exit with a fatal error.
  * apropos is much faster when run with many arguments.
  * whatis may be given the full path to an executable as an argument,
    in which case it will look up the base name of that executable in
    the appropriate parts of the manpath.
  * Translated manual pages are no longer displayed starting with a
    spurious blank line.
  * Fix double-free in mandb when encountering a symlink outside the
    manual hierarchy, thanks to Peter Schiffer.
  * Running 'man -w' (with a new --path alias) without a name now
    prints the manpath, for compatibility with other man
    implementations.  The vim viewdoc plugin makes use of this.
  * Fix a segfault when scanning links to empty pages.
  * Once we've seen at least one record in a page's NAME section,
    ignore any further records that don't include a whatis
    description, as they tend to be noise.
  * Ensure that the target of a symlink or .so chain is always recorded
    as a real page.
  * Read a user-specified configuration file even if HOME is unset.
  * Fix failure to display manual pages in some encodings when
    installed setuid.
  * Wrap long table cells in man(1), fixing test failures with groff
    1.21.
  * If an explicit section is passed to man, then pages that match
    that section exactly will be preferred over pages that only have
    that section as a prefix.
  * Fix a segfault when 'man -K' tries to display certain pages.
  * Fix a segfault in some situations when processes are killed by
    SIGHUP, SIGINT, or SIGTERM.
  * As promised in the release notes for man-db 2.5.8, man-db no
    longer ships its own copy of libpipeline
    (http://libpipeline.nongnu.org/).  You must build and install that
    library separately.
  * Search the full manpath when expanding .so directives in manual
    pages.  As part of this, '.so name.1' should now work as well as
    '.so man1/name.1'.
  * lexgrog handles roff named glyphs and perldoc strings in NAME
    sections.
  * man no longer starts a pager if standard output is not a tty.
  * The -s option to whatis and apropos now takes a colon- or
    comma-separated list of sections, similar to 'man -S'.
  * mandb error output is neater when stderr is not a terminal.
  * Add basic support for the implementation of nroff/troff in the
    Heirloom Documentation Tools.  Title lengths are not properly set
    as yet, and many features are untested.
  * mandb removes cat* and NLS subdirectories of cat directories whose
    corresponding man directories no longer exist.
  * mandb forces SIGPIPE back to its default disposition on startup,
    to avoid noisy output in case it was started in a context where
    SIGPIPE was ignored.
  * SECTION entries in a user configuration file now override those in
    the system configuration file, rather than appending to them.
  * The default less prompt now includes "(press h for help or q to
    quit)" to help novices find their way around.
  * man-db may now be built to use Berkeley DB version 5
    (--with-db=db5).
  * Fix assertion failure on 'man -l' with an uncompressed page and
    any of --no-hyphenation, --no-justification, or a non-English
    page.
  * Try underscore-separated subpages as well as hyphen-separated
    ones, thanks to Tanguy Ortolo.
  * Build libman and libmandb as shared libraries, reducing installed
    footprint by about 200K (at least on GNU/Linux).
  * Warnings about unrecognised locales are now suppressed if the
    DPKG_RUNNING_VERSION environment variable is set (i.e. man-db is
    running within a Debian package's maintainer script), since the
    system locales are often out of sync with the C library in that
    context.  Thanks to the Debian Perl maintainers for the idea.
  * Allow building with an external libpipeline
    (http://libpipeline.nongnu.org/), which has been split out from
    man-db.  This is a transitional measure: a future version of
    man-db will stop shipping its own copy of libpipeline.
  * mandb should no longer repeatedly rescan manual page hierarchies
    when a whatis entry turns into a broken link.
  * If a subprocess exits before man manages to read all the output
    from it, it now drains the output file descriptor rather than
    immediately discarding it.
  * If /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED is available, man attempts to use it
    to ensure that LC_CTYPE is set to an appropriate locale for the
    selected character set when invoking col. This fixes 'LANG=C man
    -E UTF-8', as used by lintian.
  * Fix possible mandb crash when MAN_MUST_CREATE is unset.
  * man can now tell nroff to disable justification if the
    --no-justification option is used.
  * If the full path to an executable is given as an argument, man
    will try looking up the corresponding manual page in the
    appropriate part of the manpath, rather than just trying to format
    the text of the executable as a manual page.
  * In the GNU manual hierarchy layout, search man<sec><ext>
    directories as well as just man<sec> (e.g. /usr/share/man/man3p as
    well as /usr/share/man/man3).
  * By request, man now prefers getting a page from the best manual
    section over getting a page in the correct language.
  * All programs now support a MAN_DEBUG environment variable which
    can be used in place of the -d/--debug option. This is useful in
    some situations where a program is being called deep in a process
    tree.
  * Add support for emulating pipe() with socketpair(), which is
    faster on some systems; thanks to Werner Fink of SUSE.
  * Cat pages are now always saved in UTF-8, and converted to the
    proper encoding at display time, which means that cat pages can
    now be saved regardless of locale. Note that a consequence of this
    is that cat pages now include formatting information (e.g.
    overstriking) and need to be run through col(1) before display.
  * Exact-section database lookups were incorrectly returning all
    database entries whose section names were prefixes of the
    requested section name. In some cases this could confuse mandb
    into never believing that the database was up to date.
  * Fix handling of pages with comma-separated names ("foo, bar,
    baz") in their NAME sections, broken by a change in 2.5.0 (!)
    to ignore manual page names containing spaces.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow in the pipeline library's line-reading
    functions. I don't believe this to be exploitable: at worst we
    might believe that there's some garbage at the end of manual pages
    (whose contents are untrusted anyway) and this bug typically
    resulted in a failed assertion the next time anything tried to
    read a line.
  * Plugged two substantial memory leaks in the pipeline library.
  * whatis and apropos only display any given manual page, or pointers
    to it, once.
  * man now sets less(1)'s environment up correctly for manual pages
    encoded in CP1251.
  * manconv no longer confuses situations such as "this UTF-8
    character is not representable in the target encoding" with "this
    text is not in UTF-8".
  * The default configuration file now includes section 0, used on
    some systems to document C library header files.
  * 'make check' now passes in the presence of a UTF-8-aware col, such
    as that in util-linux-ng.
  * The 'man -K' option is now supported to search the full text of
    all manual pages. This was inspired by a similar option in the
    other man package (currently at version 1.6f) currently maintained
    by Federico Lucifredi and formerly by Andries Brouwer, but I took
    advantage of man-db's pipeline library to implement it entirely
    in-process, without having to start a separate grep process for
    every manual page. In my tests with fairly typical searches across
    variously all manual pages or just one section, man-db's
    implementation ran between 3 and 10 times faster.
  * Database directories are now only created when there are
    corresponding manual page directories, not just because they're
    mentioned in the configuration file.
  * By default, man will now try to interpret pairs of manual page
    names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual
    page name containing a hyphen (e.g. 'man foo bar' => foo-bar(1)).
    This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a
    number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages for
    each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to
    invoke the subcommands themselves. Suggested by H. Peter Anvin,
    Federico Lucifredi, and others on the git mailing list.
  * The build process is now quieter by default. Use './configure
    --disable-silent-rules' or 'make V=0' if you don't like this or
    your make(1) doesn't support the non-standard extension required.
  * manconv understands a wider range of Emacs-style coding tags.
  * Recommendations to change MAN_DB_CREATES, MAN_DB_UPDATES, and
    MAN_CATS #define options in manconfig.h have been replaced by new
    configure options --enable-automatic-create,
    --disable-automatic-update, and --disable-cats respectively. Note
    that automatic user database creation is now off by default, as it
    is often too slow for the usefulness it adds; use
    --enable-automatic-create to enable it.
  * Pages that declare a non-default encoding in their preprocessor
    lines are now handled correctly.
  * man-db's 'make check' now tests that all its own manual pages
    format without errors or warnings from groff, to ensure a
    better-quality release.
  * lexgrog now stops on any unrecognised roff request, rather than
    continuing and often littering the database with garbage.
  * man no longer requires both standard input and standard output to
    be terminals in order to use the terminal line length. The line
    length from standard output is preferred if available.
  * The manpath was built completely wrongly when multiple entries
    were present in LANGUAGE: duplicates were handled strangely, and
    languages were effectively iterated in reverse order. It should be
    rather more sensible now.
  * The MAN_KEEP_STDERR environment variable can now be used to
    override man's default of discarding stderr when stdout is a
    terminal.
  * Handling of terminal widths for cat pages is now configurable,
    using the MINCATWIDTH, MAXCATWIDTH, and CATWIDTH configuration
    file directives.
  * 'man -a' now detects duplicate manual page candidates more
    reliably, and sorts them better.
  * Belarusian, Estonian, Greek, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian,
    Romanian, Slovenian, and Ukrainian pages are now supported.
  * man can now search for pages using regular expressions (with
    --regex) or shell wildcards (with --wildcard). By default this
    searches both page names and descriptions, like apropos, but if
    the --names-only option is used then it searches page names only,
    like whatis.
  * man can now tell nroff to disable hyphenation if the
    --no-hyphenation option is used.
  * man-db already searched for manual pages in ../man and man
    directories relative to each $PATH component; it now searches in
    ../share/man and share/man directories too.
  * Groff 1.20 was recently released, including the 'preconv'
    preprocessor. Although man-db has supported preconv to some extent
    since 2.4.4, man-db's configure now detects its presence and
    infers that groff supports Unicode input using it; man also now
    takes slightly better advantage of preconv than before.
  * Per-locale groff macros are now loaded if possible, allowing us to
    take advantage of such things as localised versions of predefined
    strings and language-aware hyphenation. This only works with Groff
    1.20.2 or better (not yet released), since earlier versions did
    not allow us to suppress warnings in the event that the
    appropriate macro file is not available.
  * Cleaned up a number of possible crashes, memory leaks, and missing
    error checks found by the Coverity Scan project.
  * Fix build if MAN_CATS is undefined.
  * If the LINGUAS environment variable is set while running
    configure, it now controls building and installation of localised
    manual pages as well as program translations.
  * The LANGUAGE environment variable is now tokenised properly,
    rather than only taking the first two characters of each element.
  * Fix build if --disable-nls is used or iconv is not available.
  * man now correctly propagates the exit code of whatis or apropos
    when called with the -f or -k option respectively.
  * A number of inconsistencies and readability problems with man-db's
    own manual pages have been cleaned up, thanks mainly to Yuri
    Kozlov.
  * Reduce the number of warnings emitted when using an unrecognised
    locale.
  * manconv and zsoelim are now called internally rather than by
    executing external programs, to improve performance.
  * man-db now uses GDBM (--with-db=gdbm) in preference to Berkeley DB
    (--with-db=db or --with-db=dbN where N is 1, 2, 3, or 4) by
    default, since hardware improvements have rendered Berkeley DB's
    speed advantages negligible for our purposes and the relatively
    frequent SONAME and on-disk format changes are not worth the
    hassle. Distributors should note that if they follow this change
    then they will need to arrange for databases to be rebuilt on
    upgrade to this version.
  * Duplicate manual page hierarchies due to symlinks (e.g. /usr/man
    -> /usr/share/man) are detected and removed from the search order.
  * A locale modifier (e.g. @latin) in a directory name must now match
    the locale if the former is set, in addition to the language and
    territory.
  * Bare .so includes (e.g. ".so foo.1" rather than ".so man1/foo.1")
    now work, although only within the same manual page hierarchy for
    now.
  * 'man -H' (without a browser argument) was completely broken in
    2.5.1 and is now fixed.
  * man no longer breaks in Japanese locales when using less as a
    pager.
  * The --encoding option to man can now take a true character
    encoding rather than a *roff device; the latter was an unreliable,
    inflexible, and awkward way to select an output encoding. The old
    semantics are still supported for backward compatibility.
  * Whatis parsing stops at .ie or .if conditionals.
  * CJK locale specifications where the codeset component is
    equivalent to but not stringwise-identical to UTF-8 (e.g.
    zh_CN.utf8) are handled better.
  * man(1)'s OPTIONS section is ordered more comprehensibly.
  * apropos, lexgrog, man, mandb, and whatis ignore encoding
    conversion errors for the last possible encoding of the source
    page. This helps, for example, with pages including misencoded
    non-ASCII names of authors; it usually seems better to allow these
    pages to pass with small errors than to break them entirely.

  * man no longer breaks in Japanese locales when using less.
  * The --encoding option to man can now take a true character

- Make libzio interface smarter, that is if used only for simple
  decompression do not use a pipe (saves 30% mandb run time)
  (bnc#381830)
- Make cron.daily.do_mandb smarter, that is check if anything
  has changes in the global manual paths that needs to run mandb
  (bnc#381830)
- Update to bug fix version 2.5.1
  * The manual is now built automatically, avoiding some ordering
    problems on 'make distclean'.
  * Manual pages are converted to the proper input encoding for troff
    output as well as nroff output.
  * The -t, -T, -X, and -Z options to man work again; in 2.5.0, they
    read input from stdin rather than from the manual page.
  * apropos and whatis no longer segfault when given an explicit
    locale using -L.
  * man now understands that groff's ascii device takes ASCII input,
    not ISO-8859-1.
  * man no longer discards stderr when writing to a file or a pipe;
    this was broken by an overenthusiastic change in 2.5.0.
  * manconv now falls back to the next encoding in its list if any
    characters in an entire 64KB block fail to decode using the
    current encoding, as was originally intended.
  * manconv is more careful about extracting coding: directives from
    manual pages.
  * Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\ now work again at the prompt issued by 'man -a'.
  * There is a new --with-sections configure option to change the
    default value of SECTION in the configuration file.
  * Automake is now used to generate Makefiles. Among other things,
    this fixes VPATH builds and some bugs in dependency generation,
    and should allow building with non-GNU versions of make.
  * man-db now uses the Gnulib portability library, allowing the
    removal of earlier haphazard portability code. While this results
    in a somewhat larger source distribution, it makes man-db easier
    to maintain and should make it easier to build on systems to which
    the maintainer does not have access.
  * In the process of switching to Gnulib, the last vestiges of
    pre-C89 support have been removed; they were documented to be
    broken anyway.
  * If the MANROFFOPT environment variable is set, man now appends its
    value to the *roff command line.
  * man now accepts a --recode option to output a source manual page
    converted to a specified encoding.
  * For compatibility with System V, man accepts -s as an alias for
    -S, and permits sections to be comma-separated as well as
    colon-separated.
  * man now accepts a --warnings option to enable groff warnings.

- add the two lines
	.if '\*[.T]'utf8' \

  U+002D (HYPHEN-MINUS) instead of U+2212 (MINUS SIGN) as the
  minus sign in front of options in man-pages rendered in UTF-8
  locales. U+2212 (MINUS SIGN) makes searching in man-pages for
  options unnecessarily difficult.

- Make `setlocale'zing more reliable accordingly to Andreas
  Jaeger.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  9 02:15:38 CET 2000 - mfabian@suse.de

- replaced all setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,"") with
  setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,"") *and* setlocale(LC_CTYPE,"").

  After the upgrade to Glibc 2.2, 8 bit characters in the
  French, Czech, and Japanese messages were displayed as "?".
  Changing the setlocale calls in the above way fixed it.
  Messages in all languages now display correctly again.

  First I replaced all setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,"") by
  setlocale(LC_ALL,""), but this causes problems. In that case,
  the messages display correctly, but  "LANG=ja_JP man man"
  incorrectly displays the English manpage. Strange.
  When using both setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,"") *and*
  setlocale(LC_CTYPE,"") but not setlocale(LC_ALL,""),
  everything seems to work correctly.
