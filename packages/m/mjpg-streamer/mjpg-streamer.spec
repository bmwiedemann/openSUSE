%description
MJPG-streamer takes JPGs from Linux-UVC compatible webcams, from
local files or other input plugins and streams them as M-JPEG via
HTTP to webbrowsers, VLC and other software. It is the successor of
uvc-streamer, a Linux-UVC streaming application with Pan/Tilt.

This package provides a fork including support for Raspberry Pi Camera.

Enable the service by specifing the video device via

# systemctl start mjpg_streamer@0

The number reflects /dev/videoX and listening port 808X.
