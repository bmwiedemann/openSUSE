  <title>Mgetty Listens for Data, Fax, or Voice Calls on a Serial Line</title>
  <description>This package turns your computer into a fax machine. With some voice
modems (Zyxel, Rockwell, and USR), you can even use your computer as an
answering machine.

Mgetty recognizes what kind of call it is receiving and does everything
else automatically. It is able to accept data (login/PPP), fax, and
(depending on your modem) voice calls. Find the documentation in
/usr/share/doc/packages/mgetty and TeX Info files in /usr/share/info.

The configuration files are in /etc/mgetty+sendfax.</description>
