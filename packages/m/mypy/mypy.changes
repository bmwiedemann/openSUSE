- update to version 0.790:
 - Enabling and Disabling Error Codes
  - You can now globally disable and enable the generation of error messages with specific error codes by using --enable-error-code and --disable-error-code command line options (and config file options). This lets you disallow certain checks that don’t provide value or are too noisy, and in the future these can be used to enable optional, stricter checks. For more information, read the documentation.

Sat Jul  4 12:28:39 UTC 2020 - Sebastian Wagner <sebix+novell.com@sebix.at>

- update to version 0.780:
 - Following Imports in Mypy Daemon
  - You can now leave out the --follow-imports option when running dmypy, and mypy daemon will follow imports, similar to a non-daemon mypy run.
    Previously mypy daemon did not support this, and it was necessary to use --follow-imports and explicitly mention all files to check on the command line. (Following imports in mypy daemon is an experimental feature.)
    See the docs about following import in mypy.
 - Miscellaneous New Features:
  - Support environment variable interpolation for junit_xml configuration key (Mattwmaster58, PR 8479)
  - Add no_site_packages config file setting (davidzwa, PR 8524)
  - Allow .mypy.ini (with a dot prefix) as an alternative name to mypy.ini (dosisod, PR 8515)
  - Disallow unpacking of strings in multiple assignment, as this is usually a bug (Abtin, PR 8589)
  - Allow type aliases in a runtime (non-type) context (PR 8779)
  - Add narrowing unions with bool literals via identity check (Steve Dignam, PR 8821)
  - Always allow to cast to Any without warnings (oda, PR 8544)
  - Suggest solutions for a typo in a key of a TypedDict (Felicián Németh, PR 8483)
  - Provide more context about why incompatible with supertype is an error (Chetan Khanna, PR 8866) 
 - Other Notable Improvements and Bug Fixes:
  - Fix handling dependencies to __call__ in mypy daemon (PR 8494)
  - Various improvements to stubtest (PR 8502, PR 8886) (Shantanu)
  - Fix invalid type causing named tuple errors reported in wrong files (PR 8549)
  - Clarify documentation of Liskov substitution principle (PR 8563)
  - Fix type inference with lambda that returns None (PR 8562)
  - Fix incremental crash bug caused by NewType in functions (PR 8607)

  - Fix parser when using Python 3.9 (PR 8716)
  - Accept dict() as an empty dictionary in a TypedDict context (PR 8749)
  - Fix incorrect coroutine return type for nested function (Jens Widell, PR 8741)
  - Reject bytes literal as a TypedDict key (PR 8782)

  - Look at arguments when generating constraints for an overload (PR 8845)
  - Fix potential wrong-file error message for unsupported types (PR 8854) 
 - Typeshed Updates
  - Many small improvements were made to typeshed — too many to list. Browse the typeshed commit log here.
- update to version 0.770:
 - Tagged Unions
  - Previously, the only way to distinguish between two types in a union was to use an isinstance check. Now, mypy supports distinguishing between two or more types based on the value of some common shared "tag" field.
    This feature is most useful when you want to narrow down a union of TypedDicts: since TypedDicts are really just regular dicts at runtime, using isinstance checks won't work. Instead, you can now label or tag each TypedDict with a distinct Literal type and discriminate by checking that tag.
    Note that you can import Literal from typing_extensions on Python 3.7 and earlier.
    You can also use this technique to discriminate between unions of objects, tuples, or named tuples, so long as: 1. Every item in your union is tagged with a unique value 2. Mypy understands how to narrow the union of the tag values.
    For more details and examples, see the documentation on tagged unions.
 - Type Inference Improvements
   Type inference is now more powerful. Mypy can infer types in some cases where you previously needed an explicit type annotation.
   Mypy can infer a built-in collection type from augmented assignment statements.
   Some dictionary construction idioms are better supported.
   Mypy is better at inferring defaultdict types.
 - Multiple Inheritance and isinstance() Checks
   Previously, mypy assumed a variable cannot have two unrelated types when analyzing isinstance checks. For example, in the following example B is not a subclass of A, so mypy would incorrectly conclude the isinstance check is always false, and that the if-branch is unreachable — even though var could actually be a subtype of both types.
   This meant that mypy skipped type checking anything inside the if statement, since it (by design) skips analyzing unreachable branches.
   Now, mypy will instead decide that the narrowed type of x is test.<subclass of "A" and "B">, instead of marking the branch as unreachable.
   If it’s impossible for two types to be a subtype of one another, mypy will continue to not attempt to infer this "ad-hoc intersection".
 - Other Notable Improvements and Bug Fixes:
  - Fix some crash bugs involving import * and import cycles (PR 8450)
  - Fix interaction of descriptor methods with plugins (Jan Verbeek, PR 8365)
  - Allow strict in config file (Ville Skyttä, PR 8192)
  - Don’t crash when a module shadows builtin libraries (such as typing or types, PR 8405)
  - Fix type join between subclasses of unicode and str (PR 8402)
  - Fix type join of fixed-length tuples with mismatching lengths (Marti Raudsepp, PR 8333)
  - Fix type join of Sequence (e.g. variadic tuple) and fixed-length tuple (Marti Raudsepp, PR 8335)
  - Make mypy.api.run_dmypy actually capture the output (PR 8375)
  - Support determining whether a literal is truthy (Jan Verbeek, PR 8368)
  - Fix covariant overriding of decorated methods (Xuanda Yang, PR 8350)
  - Support typing.Annotated in addition to typing_extensions.Annotated (Jakub Stasiak, PR 8371)
  - Add add_method_to_class function to plugins.common (useful when writing mypy plugins) (Maksim Kurnikov, PR 8245)
  - Fix module alias as instance attribute (Uwe L. Korn, PR 8259)
  - Automatically write a file .gitignore file to cache directory, ignoring everything (Ville Skyttä , PR 8193)
  - Don't make dunder attributes enum members (Xuanda Yang, PR 8302)
  - Allow redefining TypedDict keys (while still generating an error) (Cohen Karnell, PR 8109)
  - Fix some crashes in dataclasses (PR 8271)
  - Use TypedDict union as type context when unambiguous (PattenR, PR 8212)

  - Fix regression in container check logic (Michael Lee, PR 8232)
  - Make reachability code understand chained comparisons (Michael Lee, PR 8148)

  - Fix crash when overriding __init__ in a dataclass subclass (Jacob Beck, PR 8159)
  - Fix some daemon crashes involving classes becoming generic (PR 8157) 
 - Documentation and Error Reporting Improvements

  - Improve diagnostics involving missing stubs for a library that is installed in site-packages (Michael Lee, PR 8238)
  - Add a section to the documentation about incompatible overrides (RAHUL RAJA, PR 8377)

  - Add a new error code for errors about unreachability (Denys Halenok, PR 8312)
  - Fix error indicator position in code with tabs (dosisod, PR 8307)
  - Document --local-partial-types (Xuanda Yang, PR 8201)
  - Update documentation for Literal types (Michael Lee, PR 8152) 
 - Stubtest rewrite
   stubtest is a tool that compares stub definitions to what it finds at runtime with introspection and reports back inconsistencies. It got a complete rewrite. Some features of the new stubtest are:
  - Find missing, extraneous or mistyped classes, methods, functions and attributes in the stubs
  - Check presence, names and kinds of function arguments, accounting for overloads, decorators, *args and kwargs. Checks argument types against their default values, accounting for type vars.
  - Checks @property, @classmethod, @staticmethod declarations
  - Check types of module level and class level attributes and enums 
 - Some results of this:
  - We now run stubtest in typeshed CI (for stdlib)
  - We’ve fixed about 1900 issues in typeshed definitions
  - We’ve greatly improved Python 3.8 support in typeshed and it’ll be easier to make the changes needed for future Python versions
  - We’ve uncovered a handful of issues in Python itself
