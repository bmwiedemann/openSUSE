%description
Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to
combine the benefits of both dynamic (or "duck") typing as well as
static typing.

Mypy type checks standard Python programs. It can catch many
programming errors by analyzing programs without having to run them.
There is basically no runtime overhead when run using any Python VM.
Mypy's type system features type inference, gradual typing, generics
and union types.
