- MuseScore 4.3.2:
  - This update includes crash fixes and performance improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 30 10:30:14 UTC 2024 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- MuseScore 4.3.1:
  This update fixes a critical usability issue affecting AZERTY
  keyboard users. The shift modifier key can now be used to trigger
  number keys, enabling note durations to be changed using the
  default shortcuts. 

  This release also improves CPU performance when using Muse
  Sounds, and resolves a number of playback bugs associated with
  repeats.

  Additional fixes:
  - Playback now falls back to MS Basic if SoundFonts are missing.
  - Volume levels of MS Basic are now better balanced between note input and playback modes.
  - An issue preventing instrument names from being deleted from beginning of staves has been resolved. 
  - Fixed a bug where synthesizers incorrectly defaulted to the piano sound.
  - Fixed a crash preventing certain scores with hidden clefs from opening.

  See the full list of improvements here:
