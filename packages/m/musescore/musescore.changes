- MuseScore 4.4.0:
  - Playback features and improvements
    - Support for Muse Sounds Drumline* libraries, including score
      migration from MDL, and ability to trigger different playback
      samples via sticking text.
    - Support for Muse Sounds choral libraries, including lyric
      text to trigger different phoneme samples.
    - Dynamics now apply independently to voices and staves (N.b.
      varies depending on sound technology used. Please consult the
      handbook for details).
    - Dynamics now use optimal playback parameters (varies
      depending on sound technology) for more realistic playback.
    - Significant audio engine optimisations (including lower
      buffer sizes), significantly reducing note input latency when
      using a MIDI keyboard, and massively reducing audio export
      times.
    - Hidden instruments can now be muted/soloed in the mixer.
  - Engraving features and improvements
    - Items such as dynamics/hairpins, text, and line objects no
      longer have to be attached ('anchored') to a note or rest,
      but can also be attached to rhythmic subdivisions within any
      duration.
    - Dynamics/hairpins can be assigned to specific voices with
      appropriate default placement, and can also be centered
      between a grand stave. There are also new style options to
      control the default positioning of dynamics/hairpins.
    - Dynamics and hairpins now snap more intelligently to each
      other, enabling better horizontal alignment. There are new
      controls in Properties for snapping and unsnapping these
      objects.
    - The layout system for accidentals has been rewritten, and
      SMuFL cutouts are now being used. This results in a more
      elegant and compact layout, especially in complex chords. New
      style options allow further configuration.
    - New style options for lyrics.
    - New style options for fretboard diagrams, including the
      ability to add fingerings.
    - Header and footer improvements, including the ability to add
      multi-line copyright text.
    - New option for "French-style" beams.
    - New options for hiding/showing instrument labels.
    - Improved alignment and interactions for ghost/dead notes in
      guitar notation.
    - New style options to show/hide double barlines before time
      and key signatures.
    - Cross-stave beam improvements, including better vertical
      spacing and new options to set beams above or below staves.
    - Many small improvements to how shapes and skylines have been
      calculated, allowing a more flexible layout.
    - Increased use of SMuFL symbols within text for pedal
      markings, ottavas, codas/segno markings, and tuplet numbers.
    - Frames can now be scaled with stave size.
    - Percussion sticking is now centered on the notehead and
      aligned to a common baseline across the system.
    - New option for separating layout of similarly-stemmed voices.
    - Thickness of slurs and ties can now be set independently.
    - Grace note slashes can now be toggled on or off in
      Properties.
    - The 'Explode' and 'Implode' functions now copy dynamics and
      text annotations, also taking their voice assignment into
      account. Grace notes are now also taken into account when
      exploding measures.
    - Many other improvements, including MusicXML improvements (See
      this detailed summary on our forum).
  - Interaction improvements
    - Multiple selected notes retain their selection after their
      durations are changed.
    - Notes can be entered into different voices without having to
      start at the beginning of the bar.
    - Palette objects now snap more intelligently to their
      applicable in-score objects when being dragged.
  - Backend updates
    - Linux support for Wayland has been improved. The AppImage can
      now be launched in Wayland mode by setting the
      QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland environment variable. Additionally, a
      positioning issue with popups, menus and tooltips has been
      resolved.
  - Plus hundreds of bug fixes. See our GitHub project for the full
    list of improvements.

- MuseScore 4.3.2:
  - This update includes crash fixes and performance improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 30 10:30:14 UTC 2024 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- MuseScore 4.3.1:
  This update fixes a critical usability issue affecting AZERTY
  keyboard users. The shift modifier key can now be used to trigger
  number keys, enabling note durations to be changed using the
  default shortcuts. 

  This release also improves CPU performance when using Muse
  Sounds, and resolves a number of playback bugs associated with
  repeats.

  Additional fixes:
  - Playback now falls back to MS Basic if SoundFonts are missing.
  - Volume levels of MS Basic are now better balanced between note input and playback modes.
  - An issue preventing instrument names from being deleted from beginning of staves has been resolved. 
  - Fixed a bug where synthesizers incorrectly defaulted to the piano sound.
  - Fixed a crash preventing certain scores with hidden clefs from opening.
