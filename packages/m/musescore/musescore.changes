- MuseScore 4.4.0:
  - Playback features and improvements
    - Support for Muse Sounds Drumline* libraries, including score
      migration from MDL, and ability to trigger different playback
      samples via sticking text.
    - Support for Muse Sounds choral libraries, including lyric
      text to trigger different phoneme samples.
    - Dynamics now apply independently to voices and staves (N.b.
      varies depending on sound technology used. Please consult the
      handbook for details).
    - Dynamics now use optimal playback parameters (varies
      depending on sound technology) for more realistic playback.
    - Significant audio engine optimisations (including lower
      buffer sizes), significantly reducing note input latency when
      using a MIDI keyboard, and massively reducing audio export
      times.
    - Hidden instruments can now be muted/soloed in the mixer.
  - Engraving features and improvements
    - Items such as dynamics/hairpins, text, and line objects no
      longer have to be attached ('anchored') to a note or rest,
      but can also be attached to rhythmic subdivisions within any
      duration.
    - Dynamics/hairpins can be assigned to specific voices with
      appropriate default placement, and can also be centered
      between a grand stave. There are also new style options to
      control the default positioning of dynamics/hairpins.
    - Dynamics and hairpins now snap more intelligently to each
      other, enabling better horizontal alignment. There are new
      controls in Properties for snapping and unsnapping these
      objects.
    - The layout system for accidentals has been rewritten, and
      SMuFL cutouts are now being used. This results in a more
      elegant and compact layout, especially in complex chords. New
      style options allow further configuration.
    - New style options for lyrics.
    - New style options for fretboard diagrams, including the
      ability to add fingerings.
    - Header and footer improvements, including the ability to add
      multi-line copyright text.
    - New option for "French-style" beams.
    - New options for hiding/showing instrument labels.
    - Improved alignment and interactions for ghost/dead notes in
      guitar notation.
    - New style options to show/hide double barlines before time
      and key signatures.
    - Cross-stave beam improvements, including better vertical
      spacing and new options to set beams above or below staves.
    - Many small improvements to how shapes and skylines have been
      calculated, allowing a more flexible layout.
    - Increased use of SMuFL symbols within text for pedal
      markings, ottavas, codas/segno markings, and tuplet numbers.
    - Frames can now be scaled with stave size.
    - Percussion sticking is now centered on the notehead and
      aligned to a common baseline across the system.
    - New option for separating layout of similarly-stemmed voices.
    - Thickness of slurs and ties can now be set independently.
    - Grace note slashes can now be toggled on or off in
      Properties.
    - The 'Explode' and 'Implode' functions now copy dynamics and
      text annotations, also taking their voice assignment into
      account. Grace notes are now also taken into account when
      exploding measures.
    - Many other improvements, including MusicXML improvements (See
      this detailed summary on our forum).
  - Interaction improvements
    - Multiple selected notes retain their selection after their
      durations are changed.
    - Notes can be entered into different voices without having to
      start at the beginning of the bar.
    - Palette objects now snap more intelligently to their
      applicable in-score objects when being dragged.
  - Backend updates
    - Linux support for Wayland has been improved. The AppImage can
      now be launched in Wayland mode by setting the
      QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland environment variable. Additionally, a
      positioning issue with popups, menus and tooltips has been
      resolved.
  - Plus hundreds of bug fixes. See our GitHub project for the full
    list of improvements.

  Sounds, and resolves a number of playback bugs associated with
  repeats.

  Additional fixes:
  - Playback now falls back to MS Basic if SoundFonts are missing.
  - Volume levels of MS Basic are now better balanced between note input and playback modes.
  - An issue preventing instrument names from being deleted from beginning of staves has been resolved.
