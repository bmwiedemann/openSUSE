  <title>Media Player Information</title>
  <description>This package contains a repository of data files describing media player
(mostly USB Mass Storage ones) capabilities. These files contain information
about the directory layout to use to add music to these devices, about the
supported file formats, ... These capabilities used to be provided by HAL
in the 10-usb-music-players.fdi file but had to be moved elsewhere as part
of the big HALectomy.</description>
