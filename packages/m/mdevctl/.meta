  <description>mdevctl is a utility for managing and persisting devices in the mediated device framework of the Linux kernel. Mediated devices are sub-devices of a parent device (e.g. a vGPU) which can be dynamically created and potentially used by drivers like vfio-mdev for assignment to virtual machines.
