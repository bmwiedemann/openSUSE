%description
mdevctl is a utility for managing and persisting devices in the mediated device
framework of the Linux kernel. Mediated devices are sub-devices of a parent
device (e.g. a vGPU) which can be dynamically created and potentially used by
drivers like vfio-mdev for assignment to virtual machines.
