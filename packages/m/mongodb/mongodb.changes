  * Documents that contain embedded null characters can be created: SERVER-7005
  * IX GlobalLock being held while waiting for WiredTiger cache eviction: SERVER-22964
- Update to version 3.0.11:
  * For MongoDB 3.0.9 and MongoDB 3.0.10, during chunk migration, insert and update operations to documents in the migrating chunk are not reflected in the destination shard: SERVER-23425
- Update to version 3.0.10:
  * Read preference of secondaryPreferred can end up using unversioned connections: SERVER-18671
  * For MMAPv1 journaling, the “last sequence number” file (lsn file) may be ahead of what is synced to the data files: SERVER-22261.
  * Data size change for oplog deletes can overflow 32-bit int: SERVER-22634
  * High fragmentation on WiredTiger databases under write workloads: SERVER-22898.
- Update to version 3.0.9:
  * Queries which specify sort and batch size can return results out of order if documents are concurrently updated. SERVER-19996

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  4 19:26:48 UTC 2015 - jacobwinski@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.0.5.
- Drop mongodb-ssl-FIPS_mode_set.patch: fixed upstream.
- Drop most of mongo-tools, they are not a seperate project.
- Update spec file to reflect build, compilation and package requirements.
- Update mongodb.conf file to reflect new filetype:
  * all existing defaults were ported over to the new mongodb.conf
  * mongodb.conf file was based on the default upstream
  * old style conf file is still supported by MongoDB 3.0.5, 
    but migration is recommended.
- Drop mongodb-2.4.11-ppc_patch_based_on_mongo_ibmsoe.patch due to incompatibilities:
  * MongoDB now uses the new WiredTiger storage engine. Newest IBM Power8 (PPC) patch:
    1) has not been updated for MongoDB 3.0.5
	2) pre-dates WiredTiger support
	3) upstream has already started to incorporate PPC64 support based on the IBM patchset
  * Therefore, to avoid major issues like data corruption and conflicts resulting from
    upstream already incorporating partial PPC64 supprt, this patch set has been dropped.
  * PPC64 is enabled using upstream code.
  * WARNING: quoting upstream: "Please note that MongoDB does no testing on Power8
    at this time, so this is definitely not a supported configuration."
- Drop mongodb-src-r2.4.12-no-werror.patch: no longer applies.
- Drop mongodb_2_4_10_add_js_engine_v8_3_14_option.patch: no longer valid
  as upstream now provides its own newer version of v8_3.XX
- Drop mongodb_2_4_10_import_v8_3_14_5_JS2C_Python_scripts.patch: no longer valid
  as upstream now provides its own Python scripts matching provided v8_3.XX
- Drop mongodb_2_4_10_update_v8_3_14_SConscript_for_ppc.patch: v8_3.14 no longer used.
- Enable WiredTiger on supported architectures:
  * quoting upstream: "WiredTiger as embedded in the MongoDB source tree
    does not currently support PPC64."
- Use upstream gperftool when possible:
  * "Changed in version 3.0.0: MongoDB uses a customized built-in version of tcmalloc 
    to achieve significant performance gains. Building with --use-system-tcmalloc
    produces binaries that lack these performance gains."
- Update "ulimit" settings to recommended upstream in sysv & systemd files

  * Sharding: Sharded connection cleanup on setup error can crash mongos
  * Sharding: "type 7" (OID) error when acquiring distributed lock
    for first time
  * Storage: explicitly zero .ns files on creation
  * Storage: partially written journal last section causes recovery to fail
- 2.4.11:
  * Indexes: Fixed issue that can cause index corruption when building
    indexes concurrently
  * Indexes: Fixed issue that can cause index corruption when shutting
    down secondary node during index build
  * Indexes: Mongod now recognizes incompatible "future" text and geo
    index versions and exits gracefully
  * Indexes: Fixed issue that can cause secondaries to fail replication
    when building the same index multiple times concurrently
  * Indexes: Fixed issue that can cause index corruption on the tenth
    index in a collection if the index build fails
  * Indexes: Introduced versioning for text and geo indexes to ensure
    backwards compatibility
  * Indexes: Disallowed building indexes on the system.indexes
    collection, which can lead to initial sync failure on secondaries
  * Sharding: Avoid frequent immediate balancer retries when config
    servers are out of sync
  * Sharding: Add indexes to locks collection on config servers to
    avoid long queries in case of large numbers of collections
  * Sharding: Fixed issue that can corrupt the config metadata cache
    when sharding collections concurrently
  * Sharding: Don’t move chunks created on collections with a hashed
    shard key if the collection already contains data

    set during a compact operation
  * Replication: Fixed issue that could cause delays in elections
    when a node is not vetoing an election
  * Replication: Step down all primaries if multiple primaries are
    detected in replica set to ensure correct election result
  * Replication: Upon clock skew detection, secondaries will switch
    to sync directly from the primary to avoid sync cycles
  * Runtime: The SIGXCPU signal is now caught and mongod writes a log
    message and exits gracefully
  * Runtime: Fixed issue where mongod fails to start on Linux when
    /sys/dev/block directory is not readable
  * GridFS: Chunk size is decreased to 255 KB (from 256 KB) to avoid
    overhead with usePowerOf2Sizes option
  * SNMP: Fixed MIB file validation under smilint

    long-running shell commands to crash
  * Shell: Fixed memory leak in the md5sumFile shell utility method
