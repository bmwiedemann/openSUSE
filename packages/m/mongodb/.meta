  <title>High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database</title>
  <description>Mongo (from &quot;humongous&quot;) is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-oriented database. MongoDB is written in C++ and offers the following features:

    * Collection oriented storage: easy storage of object/JSON-style data
    * Dynamic queries
    * Full index support, including on inner objects and embedded arrays
    * Query profiling
    * Replication and fail-over support
    * Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. photos
    and videos)
    * Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (currently in early alpha)
    * Commercial Support Available

A key goal of MongoDB is to bridge the gap between key/value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which are deep in functionality).
