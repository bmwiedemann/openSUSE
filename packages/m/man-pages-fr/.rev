    <comment>These are the French man pages of the Linux Documentation Project.

Note that they are *normally older than the English versions*. So please don't remove the package from Factory just because they are a few (or more) versions behind the English man-pages ;) Translation takes time and most of the translations remain relevant anyway.

I am the new maintainer so I'll keep it up-to-date with 'upstream' (a team composed of Debian contributors in majority).</comment>

    <comment>- Add 'Provides: locale(man-pages:fr)' so that the package is
  automatically installed when locale is French.
- Add 'Suggests: man-pages-fr-extra'. It might be turned into
  'Recommends' in the future.</comment>
