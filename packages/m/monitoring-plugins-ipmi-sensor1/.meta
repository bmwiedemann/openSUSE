  <title>IPMI Sensor Monitoring Plugin for Nagios/Icinga</title>
  <description>This plugin checks all IPMI sensors of a server remotely or locally. It works
with any IPMI-compatible server, so you can use it also in heterogeneous
environments with different server vendors.

Version 2.x of the plugin is based on ipmimonitoring (FreeIPMI). It monitors
both IPMI sensor classes (threshold and discrete). The older version 1.x (which
is still maintained) is based on ipmitool and can only monitor threshold based
sensors.
