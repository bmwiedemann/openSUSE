- Update to 0.7.0
  * [breaking] By default websocket TLS support is now disabled in
    the library crate. TLS is required for secure websocket
    connections to the mailbox server (wss://). As the handshake
    protocol itself is encrypted, this extra layer of encryption is
    superfluous. Most WASM targets however refuse to connect to
    non-TLS websockets. For maximum compatibility with all mailbox
    servers, or for web browser support, select a TLS
    implementation by specifying the feature flag tls for a
    statically linked implementation via the ring crate, or
    native-tls for dynamically linking with the system-native TLS
    implementation.
  * For experimental (unstable) transfer-v2 protocol support,
    enable feature flag experimental-transfer-v2. The protocol is
    not yet finalized.
