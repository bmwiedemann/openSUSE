  <title>Mathomatic computer algebra system</title>
  <description>Mathomatic is a free, portable, general-purpose Computer Algebra System (CAS) that can automatically solve, differentiate, simplify, combine, and compare algebraic equations, perform standard, complex number, modular, and polynomial arithmetic, etc. It does some calculus and is very easy to learn and use. Plotting expressions with gnuplot is also supported.
