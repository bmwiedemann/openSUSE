- GNU moe 1.10:
  * The default right margin has been changed from 72 to 76.
  * The new command 'C-o k' (capitalize words in block) has been
    added. It uppercases the first letter of each word and
    lowercases the rest.
  * The new command 'C-s p' (show line position in buffer) has
    been added. It shows on the status line the percent position
    of the current line in the buffer.
  * Recursive load now ignores some non-text files by extension
  * Infinite replacement loops are now detected.
  * 'C-q c' (exit without saving) and 'C-q x' (save and exit) now
    exit much faster when editing many files (thousands).
  * 'C-q x' (save and exit) now does not delete any buffer handles
    until all modified buffers have been succesfully saved. And
    shows "Read only" without asking for a name if a modified
    unnamed read-only buffer is found.
  * The UTF-8 decoder now converts some more characters.
  * Showing the contents of a directory no longer alters the
    position of the top line of the buffers menu.
  * The buffers menu is now shown even if there is only one buffer
  * When showing the contents of a directory, ".." is now put
    always first even if some file precede it in ASCIIbetical order
  * On buffers larger than 1000 lines, bookmarks 1 to 9 are now set
    at 10% to 90% of the buffer size in lines

    passed in the command line.
  * Added a new help key 'C-a'.
  * encoding.cc: UTF-8 decoder now converts some more characters.
  * buffer_handle.h (Buffer_handle): Adjust '+line,col' for tabs.
  * set_to_matching_delimiter: Skip delimiters inside /**/ comments.
  * Added 'N' command to the basic less emulation.
  * rc.cc (process_options): Don't use stdin more than once.
  * window_vector.cc (remove_duplicate_lines): Run 20% faster.
  * Cut long filenames in messages like "File '...filename' saved".
  * Set an 8-bit "C" locale in Cygwin to show chars > 127.
  * configure: Avoid warning on some shells when testing for g++.
  * Makefile.in: Detect the existence of install-info.

- GNU moe 1.8:
  * Moe is now able to read some types of non regular files at
    startup. Opening non regular files during the editing session 
    is not allowed because it could cause moe to be killed, losing
    the changes of any other files being edited.
  * "Center line" now works correctly in overwrite mode.
