  <title>LV2 port of MDA plugins</title>
  <description>MDA-LV2 is an LV2 port of the MDA plugins by Paul Kellett. It
contains 36 high-quality plugins for a variety of tasks.

The instrument plugins make use of the new atom:AtomPort to receive
MIDI. Apologies for any inconvenience, but this means they will
only work in modern hosts which have implemented atom-based MIDI.
The effects should work fine in any LV2 host.
