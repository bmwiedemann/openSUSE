  <title>High-performance and widely portable implementation of MPI</title>
  <description>
MPICH is a high performance and widely portable implementation of the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) standard.

The goals of MPICH are:

 * to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports different
   computation and communication platforms including commodity clusters
   (desktop systems, shared-memory systems, multicore architectures),
   high-speed networks and proprietary high-end computing systems
   (Blue Gene, Cray)
 * to enable cutting-edge research in MPI through an easy-to-extend modular
   framework for other derived implementations
