  <title>A MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Sparse direct Solver</title>
  <description>MUMPS implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  It can operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  It has Fortran and C interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as Scotch.</description>
