  - [tg] OpenBSD sync: handle integer base out of band like ksh93

- Handle newer GCC note output during configure stage
- Ensure KSH_VERSIONNAME_VENDOR_EXT is always set to something,
  because the patch deviating from upstream is always applied

The next upstream release (R58 most likely) will add -fno-lto to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS if GCC is detected as build compiler, solving this problem on a different level.</comment>
