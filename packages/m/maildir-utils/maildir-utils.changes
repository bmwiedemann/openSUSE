-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 26 09:37:55 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.1:
  mu:
  * The server protocol (as used my mu4e) has seen a number of updates, to allow for faster rendering. As before, there’s no compatibility between minor release numbers (1.4 vs 1.6 vs 1.8) nor within development series (such as 1.7). However, within a stable release (such as all 1.6.x) the protocol won’t change (except if required to fix some severe bug; never happened in practice)
  * The processed number in the indexing statistics has been renamed into checked and describes the number of message files considered for updating, which is a bit more useful that the old value, which was more-or-less synonymous with the updated number (which are the message that got (re)parsed / (re)added to the database.  Basically, it counts all the messages for which we checked their timestamp.
  * The internals of the message handling in mu have been heavily reworked; much of this is not immediately visible but is an enabler for some new features.
  * Instead of passing --muhome, you can now also set an environment variable MUHOME.
  * The info command now includes information about the last indexing operation and the last database change that took place; note that the information may be slightly delayed due to database caching.
  * the verify command for checking signatures has been updated, and is more informative
  * a new command fields provides information about the message fields and flags for use in queries. The information is the same information that mu uses and so stays up to date.
  * a new message field changed, which refers to the time/date of the last time a message was changed (the file ctime)
  * new message flags personal to search for “personal” messages, which are defined as a message with at least one personal contact, and calendar for messages with calendar-invitations.
  * message sexps are now cached in the store, which makes delivering sexp-based search results (as used by mu4e) much faster.
  mu4e:
  * the old mu4e-view is gone; only the gnus-based one remains. This allowed for removing quite a bit of old code.
  * the mu4e headers rendering is much faster (a factor of 3+), which makes displaying big results snappier. This required some updates in the headers handling and in the server protocol. Separate from that, the cached message sexps (see the mu section) make getting the results much faster. This becomes esp. clear when there are a lot of query results.
  * “related” messages are now recognizable as such in the headers-view, with their own face, mu4e-related-face; by default with an italic slant.
  * For performance testing, you can set the variable mu4e-headers-report-render-time to t and mu4e will report the search/rendering speed of each query operation.
  * Removed header-fields :attachments, :signature, :encryption and :user-agent. They’re obsolete with the Gnus-based message viewer.
  * The various “toggles” for the headers-view (full-search, include-related, skip-duplicates, threading) were a bit hard to find and with non-obvious key-bindings. For that, there is now mu4e-headers-toggle-setting (bound to M) to handle all of that. The toggles are also reflected in the mode-line; so e.g. ‘RTU’ means we’re including [R]elated messages, and show [T]hreads, skip duplicates ([U]nique).
  * A new defcustom, mu4e-view-open-program for starting the appropriate program for a give file (e.g., xdg-open). There are some reasonable defaults for various systems. This can also be set to a function.
  * indexing happens in the background now and mu4e can interact with the server while it is ongoing; this allows for using mu4e during lengthy indexing operations.
  * mu4e-index-updated-hook now fires after indexing completed, regardless of whether anything changed (before, it fired only is something changed). In your hook-functions (or elsewhere) you can check if anything changed using the new variable mu4e-index-update-status. And note that processed has been renamed into checked, with a slightly different meaning, see the mu section.
  * message-user-organization can now be used to set the Organization: header. See its docstring for details.
  * mu4e-compose-context-switch no longer attempts to update the draft folder (which turned out to be a little fragile). However, it has been updated to automatically change the Organization: header, and attempts to update the message signature. Also, there’s a key-binding now: C-c ;
  * Changed the default for mu4e-compose-complete-only-after to 2018-01-01, to filter out contacts not seen after that date.
  * As an additional measure to limit the number of contacts that mu4e loads for auto-completions, there’s mu4e-compose-complete-max, to set a precise numerical match (before any possible filtering). Set to nil (no maximum by default).
  * Updated the “fancy” characters for some header fields. Added new ones for personal and list messages.
  * Removed make-mu4e-bookmark which was obsoleted in version 1.3.9.
  * Add command mu4e-sexp-at-point for showing/hiding the s-expression for the message-at-point. Useful for development / debugging. Bound to ~,~ in headers and view mode.
  * undo is now supported across message-saves
  * a lot of the internals have been changed:
    + mu4e is slowly moving from using the ’~'= to the more common '=--'= separator for private functions; i.e., =mu4e-foo becomes mu4e--foo.
    + mu4e-utils.el had become a bit of a dumping ground for bits of code; it’s gone now, with the functionality move to topic-specific files – mu4e-folders.el, mu4e-bookmarks.el, mu4e-update.el, and included in existing files.
    + the remaining common functionality has ended up in mu4e-helpers.el
    + mu4e-search.el takes the search-specific code from mu4e-headers.el,
  guile:
  * the current guile support has been deprecated. It may be revamped at some point, but will be different from the current one, which is to be removed after 1.8
  toys:
  * the toys (mug) has been removed, as they no longer worked with the rest of the code.

-Update to 1.4:
  mu:
  * Defaults to XDG Base Directory Specification
  * New subcommand `mu init` to initialize database -- takes
    `--my-address` and `--maildir` parameters, `mu index` does not
    accept them anymore
  * New subcommand `mu info` to display information about the database
  * Contacts are now saved in the database instead of in a separate
    file
  * `--xbatchsize` and `--autoupgrade` (for `mu index`) are removed,
    both are implicit now
  mu4e:
  * Does not use `mu4e-maildir` and `mu4e-user-mail-address-list`
    variables anymore, uses information from `mu init`
  * Performance improvements related to contacts handling
  * Added gnus' calendar-invitation handling
  * Added support for custom headers
  * Added experimental "Account Setup Handler"
  * Org-mode support is enabled by default
  * Speedbar support is disabled by default
  * Messaged-id are added to draft messages (can be found with
    `mu4e-headers-skip-duplicates` enabled)
  * Bookmarks are simple plists now (`make-mu4e-bookmark` was updated)
  * Specific bookmarks can be hidden from main menu

    recognized)
  * Replying to mailing lists has been improved
  * Shows unread/all counts for bookmarks in main menu (on by default)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  8 08:54:19 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.2:
  mu:
  * Substantial (algorithmic) speed-up of message-threading
  * The query-parser now generates better queries for wildcard
    searches, by using the Xapian machinery for that (when available)
    rather than tranforming into regexp queries
  * The perl backend is hardly used and will be removed; for now we
    just disable it in the build
  * Allow outputing messages in json format, closely following the sexp
    output. This adds an (optional) dependency on the Json-Glib library
  mu4e:
  * Bump the minimal required emacs version to 24.4. This was already
    de-facto true, now it is enforced
  * In mu4e-bookmarks, allow the `:query` element to take a function
    (or lambda) to dynamically generate the query string.
  * There is a new message-view for mu4e, based on the Gnus' article-view.
    This bring a lot of (but not all) of the very rich Gnus article-mode
    feature-set to mu4e, such as S/MIME-support, syntax-highlighting.
    Enable it with: (setq mu4e-view-use-gnus t)
  * Bug fixes

Mon Feb  5 12:34:06 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.0:
  mu:
  * New, custom query parser which replaces Xapian's 'QueryParser'

  * auxiliary programs invoked from mu/mu4e survive terminating the
    shell / emacs
  mu4e:
  * Allow for rewriting message bodies
  * Toggle-menus for header settings
  * electric-quote-(local-)mode work when composing emails
  *  Respect format=flowed and delsp=yes for viewing plain-text
     messages
  * Added new mu4e-split-view mode: single-window
  * Add menu item for `untrash'.p
  * Unbreak abbrevs in mu4e-compose-mode
  * Allow forwarding messages as attachments
    (`mu4e-compose-forward-as-attachment')
  *  Default to 'skip duplicates' and 'include headers' in
     headers-view, which should be good defaults for most users. Can
     be customized using `mu4e-headers-skip-duplicates' and
     `mu4e-headers-include-related', respectively.
  * Many bug fixed (see github for all the details).
