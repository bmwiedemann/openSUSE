Thu Feb 27 08:34:14 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.12.9:
  * new command mu4e-analyze-last-query which shows information about
    how the server interpreted the last query; this can be useful if you
    don't get the result you expected.
  * When you ask for bookmarks or maildirs through mu4e-search-bookmark or
    mu4e-search-maildir, unread counts are displayed in the (default)
    completions UI next to the maildir or bookmark. If you don't want to
    see these counts, set mu4e-hide-short-counts to non-nil.
  * experimental: a "transient" menu, which provides easy access to some
    common (and some not so common) functions in mu4e. For now, you can
    enable this with:
      (require 'mu4e-transient)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m") #'mu4e-transient-menu)
    This requires you to have the "transient" package, which means Emacs
    28 or later or alternatively you can install it manually. As stated,
    it's experimental and will be change / expanded over time, but already
    I find it quite useful.
  * gnus mailing-list management commands such as
    gnus-mailing-list-subscribe, gnus-mailing-list-unsubscribe now also
    work in mu4e. Also available through the transient menu.
  * The mu server uses PCRE-compatible regexps (for addresses), which are
    not necessarily compatible with Emacs regular expressions. However,
    mu4e can now automatically translate; this depends on the pcre2el
    package which the user should install when using regular
    expression-addresses.
  * the cleanup phase after indexing has been sped up significantly
  * updated documentation; man-pages and mu4e reference manual

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 27 16:46:23 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.12.8:
  * documentation improvements
  * removal of the old threading option and cleanup
  * 'lazy' indexing is even lazier (faster)
  * make references (the References:/In-reply-to: headers) searchable
    (with "references:" or "ref:"
  * add new combination-field "related:" to search by msgid: or
    references:
  In mu4e (see docstrings for details):
  * new command 'mu4e-view-jump-to-mime-part', to jump to some mime part
    by number.
  * new variable mu4e-trash-without-flag, if set to non-nil, "trashing" a
    message will not add the "T" flag.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 28 07:51:13 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.12.7:
  * many documentation fixes
  * mu4e: fix some mu4e-compose-captured-message corner case (#2745)
  * mu4e: fix 'user-agent' field (#2750)
  * few tiny tweaks
  * However biggest change is regarding mu's "threadiness" with respect to
    Xapian. For a while, some people, ran into Xapian database
    corruptions (I've seen it very occasionally, some people more often);
    issue #2706.
    I don't know the precise cause, but it seems to be related to using
    threads with Xapian; the mu code in this area hasn't changed much, so
    perhaps newer Xapian versions are less forgiving? Anyway, this is all
    speculation. Database corruption with mu is not catastrophic, since you
    can always rebuild it without data-loss; however, it's still annoying
    and we'd obviously want to avoid that.
    1.12.7 includes a change to make the database access single-threaded
    again, which seems to help for this problem. We're really returning to
    the behavior some older versions of mu, with the difference that now
    you'll get a message in mu4e
    Cannot handle command while indexing, please retry later.
    Hope that doesn't inconvenience people too much. Might have a deeper
    look into when I have some more time and not in the 1.12.x series.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 28 06:44:23 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  3 20:52:36 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.12.5:
  * Rework message composition; split off parts into mu4e-draft.el
    This tries harder to maintain the current buffer as expected
  * This fixes e.g. emacs-report-bug handling
  * New hook mu4e-compose-post-hook for tweaking what mu4e does when
    we're done with a message (after sending, cancelling, ...).
    By default, it tries to close the frame if needed, and restore
    the window configuration. See its docstring.
  * Better handle forwarding of encoded messages
  * Don't remove non-mu4e completion in composer
  * Integrate iCalendar support with message-composition
  * Handle mu4e-sent-messages-behavior correctly when it's a function
  * Better support NetBSD

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 27 06:22:29 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.10.0:
  mu:
  * a new command-line parser, which allows (hopefully!) for a better user
    interaction; better error checking and more
  * Invalid e-mail addresses are no longer added to the contacts-cache.
  * The cfind command gained --format=json, which makes it easy to further
    process contact information, e.g. using jq. See the manpage for more details.
  * The init command learned --reinit to reinitialize the database
    with the setings of an exisitng one
  * The script command is gone, and integrated with mu directly, i.e. the
    scripts (when enabled) are directly visible in the mu output. Also see
    the Guile section.
  * The extract command gained the --uncooked option to tell it to not replace
    spaces with dashes in extracted filenames (and a few other things).
  * Revamped manpages which are now generated from org descriptions
  * Standardize on PCRE-flavored regular expressions throughout mu.
  * Experimental: as bit of a hack, html message bodies are processed as if
    they were plain text, similar how “old mu” would do it (1.6.x and earlier).
    A nicer solution would be to convert to text, but this something for the future.
  * the MSYS2 (Windows) builds is experimental now; some things may not work;
    see e.g. https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Amsys, but
    we welcome efforts to fix those things.
  mu4e:
  * emacs 26.3 or higher is now required for mu4e
  * mu4e-view-mode-hook now fires before the message is rendered. If you have
    hook-functions that depend on the message contents, you should use the new mu4e-view-rendered-hook.
  * mu4e window management has been completely reworked and cleaned up, affecting
    the message loading as well as the window-layout. As a user-visible feature, there’s
    now the z binding (mu4e-view-detach), to ‘detach’ view and alllow for keeping multiple
    views around; see the manual entry for further details.
  * As a result of that, mu4e-split-view can no longer be a function; the new way is to
    use display-buffer-alist as explained in the manual
  * mu4e now keeps track of ‘baseline’ query results and shows the difference from that
    in the main view and modeline (you’ll might see something like 1(+1)/2 for your bookmarks
    or in the modeline; that means that there is one more unread message since baseline;
    see the manual entry for details. The idea is that you get a quick overview of where
    changes happened while you were doing something else. This is a somewhat experimental
    feature which is under active development
  * Related to that, you can now crown one of your bookmarks in mu4e-bookmarks with :favorite t,
    causing it to be highlighted in the main view and used in the mode-line. See the new modeline
    entry in the manual; this uses the new mu4e-modeline-mode minor-mode.
  * Expanding on that further, you can also get desktop notifications for new mail (on systems
    with DBus for now; see Desktop notifications in the manual.
  * If your search query matches some bookmark, the modeline now shows the bookmark’s name
    rather than the query; this can be controlled through mu4e-modeline-prefer-bookmark-name (default: t).
  * You can now tell mu4e to use emacs’ completion system rather than the mu4e built-in one;
    see the variables mu4e-read-option-use-builtin and mu4e-completing-read-function; e.g. to
    always emacs completion (which may have been enhanced by various completion frameworks), use:
    (setq mu4e-read-option-use-builtin nil mu4e-completing-read-function 'completing-read)
    when moving messages (which includes changing flags), file-flags changes are propagated to
    duplicates of the messages; that is, e.g. the Seen or Replied status is propagated to all
    duplicates (earlier, this was only done when marking a message as read). Note, Draft, Flagged
    and Trashed flags are deliberately not propagated.
  * Teach mu4e-copy-thing-at-point about shr links
  * The mu4e-headers-toggle-setting has been renamed mu4e-headers-toggle-property and has the new
    default binding P, which works in both the headers-view and message-view. The older functions
    mu4e-headers-toggle-threading, mu4e-headers-toggle-threading, mu4e-headers-toggle-full-search
    mu4e-headers-toggle-include-related, full-search~skip-duplicates have been removed (with their
    keybindings) in favor of mu4e-headers-toggle-property.
  * There’s also a new property mu4e-headers-hide-enabled, which controls wheter mu4e-headers-hide-predicate
    is applied (when non-~nil~). This can be used to temporarily turn the predicate off/on.
  * You can now jump to previous / next threads in headers-view, message view. Default binding is
    { and }, respectively.
  * When searching, the number of hidden messages is now shown in the message footer along with the
    number of Found messages
  * The eldoc support in header-mode is now optional and disabled by default; set mu4e-eldoc-support
    to non-nil to enable it.
  * In the main view, the keybindings shown are a representation of the actual keybindings, rather than
    just the defaults. This is for the benefit for people who want to use different keybindings.
  * As a side-effect of that, mu4e-main-mode and mu4e-main-mode-hook functions are now invoked before
    the rendering takes place; if you’re customizations depend on happening after rendering is completed,
    use the new mu4e-main-rendered-hook instead.
  * mu4e-cache-maildir-list has been promoted to be a defcustom, enabled by default. This caches the list
    of “other” maildirs (i.e., without a shortcut).
  * For testing, a new command mu4e-server-repl to start a mu server just as mu4e does it. Note that
    this cannot run at the same time when mu4e runs.
  * all the obsolete function and variable aliases have been moved to mu4e-obsolete.el so we can
    unclutter the non-obsolete code a bit.
  internals:
  * As usual, there have been a number of internal updates in the mu codebase:
    + reworked the internal s-expression parser
    + new command-line argument parser (based on CLI11)
    + message-move flag propagation moved from the mu4e-server to mu-store
    + more mu4e~ internals have been renamed/reworked in to mu4e--.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 26 09:37:55 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 1.8.1:
  mu:
  * The server protocol (as used my mu4e) has seen a number of updates, to allow for faster rendering. As before, there’s no compatibility between minor release numbers (1.4 vs 1.6 vs 1.8) nor within development series (such as 1.7). However, within a stable release (such as all 1.6.x) the protocol won’t change (except if required to fix some severe bug; never happened in practice)
  * The processed number in the indexing statistics has been renamed into checked and describes the number of message files considered for updating, which is a bit more useful that the old value, which was more-or-less synonymous with the updated number (which are the message that got (re)parsed / (re)added to the database.  Basically, it counts all the messages for which we checked their timestamp.
  * The internals of the message handling in mu have been heavily reworked; much of this is not immediately visible but is an enabler for some new features.
  * Instead of passing --muhome, you can now also set an environment variable MUHOME.
  * The info command now includes information about the last indexing operation and the last database change that took place; note that the information may be slightly delayed due to database caching.
  * the verify command for checking signatures has been updated, and is more informative
  * a new command fields provides information about the message fields and flags for use in queries. The information is the same information that mu uses and so stays up to date.
  * a new message field changed, which refers to the time/date of the last time a message was changed (the file ctime)
  * new message flags personal to search for “personal” messages, which are defined as a message with at least one personal contact, and calendar for messages with calendar-invitations.
  * message sexps are now cached in the store, which makes delivering sexp-based search results (as used by mu4e) much faster.
  mu4e:
  * the old mu4e-view is gone; only the gnus-based one remains. This allowed for removing quite a bit of old code.
  * the mu4e headers rendering is much faster (a factor of 3+), which makes displaying big results snappier. This required some updates in the headers handling and in the server protocol. Separate from that, the cached message sexps (see the mu section) make getting the results much faster. This becomes esp. clear when there are a lot of query results.
  * “related” messages are now recognizable as such in the headers-view, with their own face, mu4e-related-face; by default with an italic slant.
  * For performance testing, you can set the variable mu4e-headers-report-render-time to t and mu4e will report the search/rendering speed of each query operation.
  * Removed header-fields :attachments, :signature, :encryption and :user-agent. They’re obsolete with the Gnus-based message viewer.
  * The various “toggles” for the headers-view (full-search, include-related, skip-duplicates, threading) were a bit hard to find and with non-obvious key-bindings. For that, there is now mu4e-headers-toggle-setting (bound to M) to handle all of that. The toggles are also reflected in the mode-line; so e.g. ‘RTU’ means we’re including [R]elated messages, and show [T]hreads, skip duplicates ([U]nique).
  * A new defcustom, mu4e-view-open-program for starting the appropriate program for a give file (e.g., xdg-open). There are some reasonable defaults for various systems. This can also be set to a function.
  * indexing happens in the background now and mu4e can interact with the server while it is ongoing; this allows for using mu4e during lengthy indexing operations.
  * mu4e-index-updated-hook now fires after indexing completed, regardless of whether anything changed (before, it fired only is something changed). In your hook-functions (or elsewhere) you can check if anything changed using the new variable mu4e-index-update-status. And note that processed has been renamed into checked, with a slightly different meaning, see the mu section.
  * message-user-organization can now be used to set the Organization: header. See its docstring for details.
  * mu4e-compose-context-switch no longer attempts to update the draft folder (which turned out to be a little fragile). However, it has been updated to automatically change the Organization: header, and attempts to update the message signature. Also, there’s a key-binding now: C-c ;
  * Changed the default for mu4e-compose-complete-only-after to 2018-01-01, to filter out contacts not seen after that date.
  * As an additional measure to limit the number of contacts that mu4e loads for auto-completions, there’s mu4e-compose-complete-max, to set a precise numerical match (before any possible filtering). Set to nil (no maximum by default).
  * Updated the “fancy” characters for some header fields. Added new ones for personal and list messages.
  * Removed make-mu4e-bookmark which was obsoleted in version 1.3.9.
  * Add command mu4e-sexp-at-point for showing/hiding the s-expression for the message-at-point. Useful for development / debugging. Bound to ~,~ in headers and view mode.
  * undo is now supported across message-saves
  * a lot of the internals have been changed:
    + mu4e is slowly moving from using the ’~'= to the more common '=--'= separator for private functions; i.e., =mu4e-foo becomes mu4e--foo.
    + mu4e-utils.el had become a bit of a dumping ground for bits of code; it’s gone now, with the functionality move to topic-specific files – mu4e-folders.el, mu4e-bookmarks.el, mu4e-update.el, and included in existing files.
    + the remaining common functionality has ended up in mu4e-helpers.el
    + mu4e-search.el takes the search-specific code from mu4e-headers.el,
  guile:
  * the current guile support has been deprecated. It may be revamped at some point, but will be different from the current one, which is to be removed after 1.8
  toys:
  * the toys (mug) has been removed, as they no longer worked with the rest of the code.

Sun Apr 19 16:34:32 UTC 2020 - Alexander Graul <agraul@suse.com>

-Update to 1.4:
  mu:
  * Defaults to XDG Base Directory Specification
  * New subcommand `mu init` to initialize database -- takes
    `--my-address` and `--maildir` parameters, `mu index` does not
    accept them anymore
  * New subcommand `mu info` to display information about the database
  * Contacts are now saved in the database instead of in a separate
    file
  * `--xbatchsize` and `--autoupgrade` (for `mu index`) are removed,
    both are implicit now
  mu4e:
  * Does not use `mu4e-maildir` and `mu4e-user-mail-address-list`
    variables anymore, uses information from `mu init`
  * Performance improvements related to contacts handling
  * Added gnus' calendar-invitation handling
  * Added support for custom headers
  * Added experimental "Account Setup Handler"
  * Org-mode support is enabled by default
  * Speedbar support is disabled by default
  * Messaged-id are added to draft messages (can be found with
    `mu4e-headers-skip-duplicates` enabled)
  * Bookmarks are simple plists now (`make-mu4e-bookmark` was updated)
  * Specific bookmarks can be hidden from main menu
  * `mu4e-maildir-shortcuts` are simple plists now (old format is still
    recognized)
  * Replying to mailing lists has been improved
  * Shows unread/all counts for bookmarks in main menu (on by default)
  * `mu4e-attachment-dir` is also used for composing messages
  * `mu4e` <-> `mu` communication uses s-expressions now (includes a
    REPL for testing)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  8 08:54:19 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.2:
  mu:
  * Substantial (algorithmic) speed-up of message-threading
  * The query-parser now generates better queries for wildcard
    searches, by using the Xapian machinery for that (when available)
    rather than tranforming into regexp queries
  * The perl backend is hardly used and will be removed; for now we
    just disable it in the build
  * Allow outputing messages in json format, closely following the sexp
    output. This adds an (optional) dependency on the Json-Glib library
  mu4e:
  * Bump the minimal required emacs version to 24.4. This was already
    de-facto true, now it is enforced
  * In mu4e-bookmarks, allow the `:query` element to take a function
    (or lambda) to dynamically generate the query string.
  * There is a new message-view for mu4e, based on the Gnus' article-view.
    This bring a lot of (but not all) of the very rich Gnus article-mode
    feature-set to mu4e, such as S/MIME-support, syntax-highlighting.
    Enable it with: (setq mu4e-view-use-gnus t)
  * Bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 12:34:06 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 1.0:
  mu:
  * New, custom query parser which replaces Xapian's 'QueryParser'
    both in mu and mu4e. Existing queries should still work, but the
    new engine handles non-alphanumeric queries much better.
  * Support regular expressions in queries
  * cfind: ensure nicks are unique
  * auxiliary programs invoked from mu/mu4e survive terminating the
    shell / emacs
  mu4e:
  * Allow for rewriting message bodies
  * Toggle-menus for header settings
  * electric-quote-(local-)mode work when composing emails
  *  Respect format=flowed and delsp=yes for viewing plain-text
     messages
  * Added new mu4e-split-view mode: single-window
  * Add menu item for `untrash'.p
  * Unbreak abbrevs in mu4e-compose-mode
  * Allow forwarding messages as attachments
    (`mu4e-compose-forward-as-attachment')
  *  Default to 'skip duplicates' and 'include headers' in
     headers-view, which should be good defaults for most users. Can
     be customized using `mu4e-headers-skip-duplicates' and
     `mu4e-headers-include-related', respectively.
  * Many bug fixed (see github for all the details).
  * Updated documentation
