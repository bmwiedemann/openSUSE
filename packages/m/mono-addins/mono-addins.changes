- update version 1.2
  * Fixed bug that caused add-ins to be disabled when being updated.
  * Fixed several issues when scanning assemblies.
  * When evaluating a condition, ensure that the add-in that implements that condition is loaded. This change requires some new information to be stored in the add-in database, so the db version number has been bumped.
  * Fixed assembly resolution bug when running in MS.NET.
  * Added GTK3 implementation of the add-in manager.
  * Registered repositories are now automatically updated the first time the add-in manager is shown.

- Update to 0.6.1
  * The 0.6 release of Mono.Addins includes many improvements, bug fixes and new features:
    Add-in engine:
    * Add-in name and description can now be localized. There are new custom attributes for defining them, and can also be specified as xml elements in an add-in manifest instead of attributes.
    * Support for custom add-in properties. It is now possible to specify arbitrary properties in add-ins, which can be queried at install time (using the Mono.Addins.Setup API) or at run-time.
    * Custom extension attributes now allow specifying an extension path. In this way it is now possible to use a single custom attribute to define extensions for different extension points.
    * The default add-in directory and the add-in database directory can now be customized. In previous releases, those directories were always created as a subdirectory of the main registry directory. In this release, the location can be set to any directory.
    * Improved error reporting when a dependency is missing.
    * Added support for specifying the type of the content of string node attributes. This information is used for documentation purposes only.
    * The Cecil based reflector now uses the new Cecil/Light, which is smaller and faster
    Add-in management:
    * Added support for enabling/disabling registered repositories.
    * Added support for downloable support files, to be used for package icons, screenshots, etc.
    * New and improved add-in manager for GTK#. The user interface has been completely redesigned to make it more usable. Add-in updates are more visible and easy to install. The add-in gallery is integrated in the main window, and can show custom add-in icons and preview images.
    * Added new API for accessing custom add-in properties, even before installing them.
    * Included information about download size.
    Bug fixes:
    * Allow overwriting files when installing.
    * Fixed add-in unloading issues.
    * Fixed crash when running in .NET 4.0
    * AddinRepository.LastModified is always 01.01.1900 00:00:00
    * Addin registry access/creation errors when accessed via UNC path
    * Addin discovery/loading fails when running Visual Studio unit tests
    * ImportAddinAssemblyAttribute can't be used multiple times
    * Fix bug in GetAvailableAddin.
    * Fix add-in database issue when the last add-in of a folder is deleted or upgraded
    * Don't allow inheriting CustomExtension attributes. The attribute must be explicitly applied to classes to be marked as extensions.

Thu Feb 17 12:07:53 CST 2011 - gburt@suse.de

- Split off a -msbuild subpackage so the main mono-addins package
  does not depend on mono-devel (bnc#671844)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 29 18:08:51 UTC 2010 - ajorgensen@novell.com

- Update to 0.5
  * User defined custom attributes can now be used to declare extensions and add-in metadata.
  * The new AddinEngine class allows hosting several independent add-in engines in a single application domain.
  * Improved lazy loading of add-ins. More information is now lazy loaded.
  * An XML manifest can now be split in several files embedded as resources in an assembly.
  * More add-in information can be declared using custom attributes instead of an XML manifest: author list, imported files and assemblies, optional modules, localizers.
  * Added new API based on generic methods and collections.
  * New MSBuild tasks file and target, which allows using add-in references directly in a build file (still experimental).
  * Reorganized the samples directory.
  * Many bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  6 14:54:04 MST 2008 - ajorgensen@novell.com

- Update to 0.4
  * Added support for specifying paths to exclude from the add-in
    scan in .addins files and in add-in manifests.
  * There are several new flags which can be applied to add-ins:
    * Can't uninstall: the add-in can't be uninstalled.
    * Can't disable: the add-in can't be disabled.
    * Hidden: the add-in won't be visible in the setup tools.
  * Fixes in the add-in scanner.
    * The new (and optional) Mono.Addins.CecilReflector assembly
      provides a Cecil-based backend for the add-in scanner. This
      scanner is more reliable than the reflection based scanner.
    * When updating the registry, the add-in scanner will only
      update add-ins belonging to the running application (ignoring
      directories from other instances of the same or different
      applications sharing the same registry).
  * Fixed issue with path length limitation in Windows.
  * Other bug fixes and API improvements.
