  <title>Midnight Commander</title>
  <description>Midnight Commander is a Norton Commander clone, a program that
manipulates and manages files and directories. It is useful, fast, and
has color display on the Linux console. It also has mouse support if
you run the gpm mouse server. This program requires the terminal
description files in /usr/lib/terminfo, which are found in ncurses.rpm
(the essential ones) or terminfo.rpm (the rest).

You can also use Midnight Commander under the X Window System with your
mouse. If you enter 'mc -c', colors are used.

In Midnight Commander, the screen is divided into four sections: The
majority of the screen is covered by two directory panels. The second
to last line on the screen is the shell command line. The last line
displays the function key assignments. At the very top, the menu list
is shown. One of the directories displayed is the current working
directory. This is where most of the commands are found. For certain
commands, like copy and move, the second directory is used as the
target directory.</description>
