%description
The Guidelines Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types
that are suggested for use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by
the Standard C++ Foundation. This repo contains Microsoft's
implementation of GSL. The entire implementation is provided inline
in the headers under the gsl directory. The implementation generally
assumes a platform that implements C++14 support. While some types
have been broken out into their own headers (e.g. gsl/span), it is
simplest to just include gsl/gsl and gain access to the entire
library.
