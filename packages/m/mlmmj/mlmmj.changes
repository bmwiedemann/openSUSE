- Update to 0.7.1 which is a bugfix release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  9 17:14:07 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 0.7.0 including:
 o Add a macro to make sure mlmmj binaries are invoked with full path
 o Add the function to mlmmj-maintd to unsubscribe people who've been
   bouncing for BOUNCELIFE (default 432000 sec, 5 days) time.
   This completes the bouncehandling of mlmmj.
 o Add logging to mlmmj-maintd. mlmmj-maintd.lastrun.log in the listdir
   always has the log of the last run. This is work in progress.
 o Make mlmmj-bounce capable of sending probes
 o Include a function for easy generation of standard mail replies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun  7 00:09:26 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 0.6.0 including:
 o Add several unlinks. No need to litter queue/ with useless files
 o Don't use moderation/queue for outgoing, just use queue/
 o Christoph Thiel pointed out that listaddress and moderators belong in
   control/ so move them there
 o Get rid of all FILE * instances and replace them with fd's
 o Also mmap the subscribers file when reading subcribers
 o Do an mmap of the mail to send once, instead of reading the mail for
   each mail to send
 o Rip out the ability to fork to make more than one connection to relayhost.
   It turned out to not make any performance gain (tested with lists with
   more than 120000 subscribers), and thus only complicated things.
   KISS won, so it's gone.
 o mlmmj-maint now handles resends and cleanup
 o Fixed interrupted fgets() in write_mailbody_from_file()
 o Fixed leak of subfile in mlmmj-send

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 29 18:05:09 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 0.5.2 including:
 o footer and customheaders are now accessed from listdir/control/ where
   they belong
 o Discard mails that doesn't have one and only one From: address. Discard
   here means moving them to queue/discard
 o Make sure we retrieve info from all headers matching the token we want
 o Fixed error handling in mlmmj-send if we can not open subscribers.d/
 o Make mlmmj-send a lot more robust with SMTP and handle
   bounces from the relayhost.
 o Fix BUG in mlmmj-bounce still using listdir/subscribers
 o Handle subconf/unsubconf bounces
 o Begin work on mlmmj-maintd--the mlmmj maintenance daemon
 o Make help consistent and up to date with all options
 o Make mlmmj-send print the replies from the mailserver
 o Send our hostname in the HELO instead of relayhost
 o Implement requeueing mechanism to be able to resend mail when relayhost
   trouble occur

 o Use a subscribers.d/ directory for several subscribers files.
   mlmmj-send will now fork for each file (up to MAX_CONNECTIONS)
   for faster delivery.
   mlmmj-unsub will search for subscribers in all of these files.
   mlmmj-sub will now add emailaddresses to the file in subscribers.d/
   with the name of the first character in the emailaddress
   (foo@bar.com will be in subscribers.d/f).
 o Major cleanup of listcontrol() and in the process add closed list
   functionality (touch listdir/control/closedlist and it's closed)
