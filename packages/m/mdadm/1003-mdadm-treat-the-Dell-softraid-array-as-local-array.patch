Subject: [PATCH] mdadm: treat the Dell softraid array as local array
Patch-mainline: N/A, in-house usage only as a workaround to Dell's softraid bug
References: bsc#1175004

Dell softraid FW uses homehost in md raid superblock to store
its virtual disk name e.g. "VirtualDisk01". The improper usage
of md raid super block meta data from Dell softraid S150 utility
makes mdadm takes such md raid (Dell softraid Virtual Disk) as
foreign array and won't automatically assemble this array by
default. Here if an array's homehost name starts with "VirtualDisk"
then we take it as a Dell software raid and bypass the set_name
checking. This workaround makes current Dell software raid array
can be treated as local array and start automatically.

This workaround patch will be withdrawn after Dell softraid FW
fixes the improper usage problem on md raid superblock.
