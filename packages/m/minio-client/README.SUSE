 Calling the client with different binary names
------------------------------------------------

The minio client searches for the config based
on the binary name. This also happens with a
symlinked binary name. With the default file name
in the package it will look for

```
${HOME}/.minio-client/config.json
``` 

If you use the minio-client-as-mc package, it
looks for:

```
${HOME}/.mc/config.json
``` 

A possible solution is creating a symlink:

```
ln -s ~/.minio-client/ ~/.mc
```
