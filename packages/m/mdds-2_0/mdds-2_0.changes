Sat Dec  3 10:23:15 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.3:
  * revised the block position lookup implementation to avoid using the
    internal STL iterators.  The new implementation should be able to handle
    invalid position hints more gracefully without potential process
    termination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 20 21:22:25 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.0.2:
  * addressed various coverity issues.
  * fixed random compiler warnings.
  * fixed event handling in copy construction. In aos, the event object was not
    copied when the parent container was copied. In soa, the
    element_block_acquired() callback was not called for the cloned element
    blocks.
  * added move constructors and move assignment operators to both aos and soa
    variants.
  * added optional trace function that gets called on every called public method. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 27 15:20:40 UTC 2022 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Added patch:
  * no-stdcxx17.patch
    + Do not force --stdc++17 on this header-only library

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 17:48:19 UTC 2021 - Danilo Spinella <danilo.spinella@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.0.0:
  * set the baseline C++ version to C++17.
  * implemented structure-of-arrays (SoA) storage as its default storage
    layout for better CPU cache efficiency.
  * added multiple block position adjustment implementations with various
    loop-unrolling factors combined with SSE2 and AVX2 features.
  * added a tool called runtime-env to benchmark different block position
    adjustment implementations to determine the optimal loop-unrolling factor.
  * permanently remove rectangle_set.
  * fixed a rtree bug where the memory positions of invalidated child nodes were not
    properly updated after tree mutation.  The problem manifested itself when
    using libc++ as stdlib with clang.
  * added copy and move constructors in trie_map.
  * added a variant of find() method in trie_map that returns a mutable iterator object.
    The user can now update the value associated with a key directly via the
    iterator object.
  * added copy and move constructors in packed_trie_map.
  * added load_state() and save_state() methods in packed_trie_map to allow loading
    state from and saving state to binary files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 18 12:11:51 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.0:
  * switched to using binary search on block position lookup, which
    significantly improves element access performance in general, at the
    expense of slight performance degradation on block shifting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 15 21:10:14 UTC 2019 - Jonathan Brielmaier <jbrielmaier@suse.de>

Wed Jan  8 20:05:50 UTC 2014 - fridrich.strba@suse.com

- Upgrade to 0.10.1
  * multi_type_matrix
    - added a variant of set_empty() that takes an additional
      length parameter.
  * flat_segment_tree
    - significant performance improvement on build_tree() and
      search_tree(), by optimizing the non-leaf node object
      generation and storage to achieve better locality of
      reference.
  * segment_tree
    - slight performance improvement on build_tree(), as a result
      of the optimization done for flat_segment_tree since these
      two structures share the same tree generation code.
  * multi_type_vector
    - improved debug message on mis-matched block types (only when
      MDDS_MULTI_TYPE_VECTOR_DEBUG is defined).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 27 10:59:44 UTC 2013 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version bump to 0.8.1

* multi_type_vector

  * fixed a bug in the erase() method where adjacent blocks of the
    same type would fail to merge after the erase() call.

  * add a variant of the position() method that takes an iterator as
    positional hint.  Note that there is no variant of position() that
    takes const_iterator.

* all

  * added .pc file for pkg-config.

* flat_segment_tree

  * changed the return type of search_tree from bool to
    std::pair<const_iterator,bool>, to make it consistent with the
    search() method.  Note that this is an API-incompatible change.

* multi_type_vector

  * added char and unsigned char types to the standard types supported
    by default.

  * added position() member method that takes a logical element
    position and returns a pair of block iterator where the element
    resides and its offset within that block.

  * added at() static member method to the data block, which calls the
    at() method of the underlying std::vector container.

  * added release() member method to allow caller to release an object
    stored inside a managed block.

  * added two templates to ease creation of custom element block
    functions when using one or two custom element types.

  * added transfer() member method to allow elements in a specified
    range to be transferred from one container to another.  When
    transferring elements stored in a managed element block, the
    ownership of those elements is also transferred.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 20 11:48:26 UTC 2013 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Add URL path for download.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 14 20:12:31 UTC 2013 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Add version 0.7.1

  * add variants of set() methods (both single- and multi-value)
    insert(), set_empty() and insert_empty() methods that take an
    iterator as an additional position hint parameter for block lookup
    speed optimization.

  * add support for non-const iterators which allow the client code to
    modify values directly from the iterators.

  * set() methods (both single- and multi-parameter variants),
    set_empty(), insert() and insert_empty() methods now return
    iterator that references the block to which the values are set or
    inserted.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (single-parameter variant) which would
    insert a new block at incorrect position.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (multi-parameter variant) which would
    fail to merge neighboring blocks of identical type under certain
    conditions.

  * fixed make installer script which previously would not install
    mdds/compat headers.

* flat_segment_tree

  * fixed a bug in its iterator implementation, which previously would
    always treat the last valid position before the end position as
    the end position.  This fix affects both in const_iterator and
    const_reverse_iterator.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 31 18:48:32 UTC 2012 - kyoshida@suse.com

  - fixed several bugs in shift_right():

    - shifting of all existing nodes was not handled properly.  
    - leaf nodes were not properly linked under certain conditions.
    - shifting with skip node option was not properly skipping the 
      node at insertion position when the insertion position was at 
      the leftmost node.  

  - implemented min_key(), max_key(), default_value(), clear() and 
    swap().

  - fixed a bug in operator==() where two different containers were 
    incorrectly evaluated to be equal.  

  - added quickcheck test code.
