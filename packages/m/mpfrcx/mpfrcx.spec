%description
MPFRCX is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over
arbitrary precision real or complex numbers.

%package -n %lname
Summary:        Multi-precision floating-point interval arithmetic computation library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n %lname
MPFRCX is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over
arbitrary precision real or complex numbers, without control on the
rounding.

The motivation for the library is to have functionality available for
the floating-point approach to complex multiplication.
Asymptotically-fast routines such as Toomâ€“Cook and the FFT for
multiplication of polynomials are available, as well as fast routines
for interpolation and evaluation based on trees of polynomials.
