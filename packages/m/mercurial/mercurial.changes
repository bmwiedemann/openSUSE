- Mercurial 5.2.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 17 12:14:15 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 5.2
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.
  + New Features
    * The amend extension supports the `--currentuser` argument.
    * The amend extension supports the `--close-branch` argument.
    * The amend extension supports the `--secret` argument.
    * The uncommit extension supports the `rewrite.update-timestamp` config 
      option.
  + Backwards Compatibility Changes
    * A shell that supports `$(command)` syntax for command substitution is 
      now required for running the test suite. The test runner normally 
      uses `sh`, so if that is a shell that doesn't support `$(command)` 
      syntax, you can override it by setting `$HGTEST_SHELL` or by passing it 
      to `run-tests.py --shell <shell>`.
    * The (experimental) narrow extension's wire protocol changed. If you're 
      using it, you'll need to make sure to upgrade server and client at the 
      same time.
- refreshed mercurial.keyring 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 11:00:48 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 5.1.2 
  Regularly scheduled bug fix release.

  * extensions
    + phabricator: don't abort if property writing fails during amending
  * tests
    + test: allow different result for zstd compression (issue6188)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 15 16:49:18 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 5.1.1

    + exchange: abort on pushing bookmarks pointing to secret changesets (issue6159)
    + python-zstandard: apply big-endian fix (issue6188)
    + fncache: make debugrebuildfncache not fail on broken fncache
  * tests
    + various test runner fixes
    + fixed use of `tr --delete` for tr(1) portability

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  2 10:30:23 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 5.1
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.
  * New Features
    + New config `commands.commit.post-status` shows status after successful 
      commit.
    + `hg root` now has templating support, including support for showing 
      where a repo share's source is. See `hg help -v root` for details.
    + New `--force-close-branch` flag for `hg commit` to forcibly close branch 
      from a non-head changeset.
    + The curses-based interface for commands like `hg commit -i` now supports 
      a range-select mechanism. Select the first line using space like before, 
      navigate to the last line, and press X (capital x) to set all items in 
      the range at once. Lowercase x has been added as a synonym for space to 
      help reinforce the mechanism, and pressing enter/return continues to be a 
      synonym for "toggle the current line and move down to the next item in 
      this section."
  * New Experimental Features
    + New config `experimental.log.topo` makes `hg log -G` use topological 
      sorting. This is especially useful for aliases since it lets the alias 
      accept an `-r` option while still using topological sorting with or 
      without the -r (unlike if you use the `sort(..., topo)` revset).
  * Bug Fixes
    + issue4292: "hg log and {files} {file_adds} {file_mods} {file_dels} in 
      template show wrong files on merged revision". See details in "Backwards 
      Compatibility Changes".
  * Backwards Compatibility Changes
    + Removed (experimental) support for log graph lines mixing 
      parent/grandparent styles. Setting e.g. 
      `experimental.graphstyle.parent = !` and 
      `experimental.graphstyle.grandparent = 3.` would use `!` for the first 
      three lines of the graph and then `..`. This is no longer supported.
    + If ui.origbackuppath had been (incorrectly) configured to point to a 
      file, we will now replace that file by a directory and put backups in 
      that directory. This is similar to how we would previously replace files 
      *in* the configured directory by subdirectories.
    + Template keyword `{file_mods}`, `{file_adds}`, and `{file_dels}` have 
      changed behavior on merge commits. They used to be relative to the first 
      parent, but they now consider both parents. `{file_adds}` shows files 
      that exists in the commit but did not exist in either parent. 
      `{file_dels}` shows files that do not exist in the commit but existed in 
      either parent. `{file_mods}` show the remaining files from `{files}` 
      that were not in the other two sets.
  * Internal API Changes
    + Matchers are no longer iterable. Use `match.files()` instead.
    + `match.visitdir()` and `match.visitchildrenset()` now expect the empty 
      string instead of `'.'` to indicate the root directory.
    + `util.dirs()` and `util.finddirs()` now include an entry for the root 
      directory (empty string).
    + `shelve` is no longer an extension now. It will be turned on by default.
    + New API to manage unfinished operations: Earlier there were distinct APIs
      which dealt with unfinished states and separate lists maintaining them
      that are `cmdutil.afterresolvestates`, `cmdutil.unfinishedstates` 
      and `cmdutil.STATES`. Now these have been unified to a single API which 
      handles the various states and their utilities. This API has been added 
      to `state.py`. Now instead of adding to these 3 lists independently a 
      state for a new operation can be registered using `addunfinished()` 
      in `state` module.
    + `cmdutil.checkunfinished()` now includes detection for merge too.
    + merge abort has been disallowed in case an operation of higher 
      precedence is in progress to avoid cases of partial abort of operations.
    + We used to automatically attempt to make extensions compatible with
      Python 3 (by translating their source code while loading it). 
      We no longer do that.

  A regularly scheduled bugfix release.
  + commands
    * Help fixes on hg mv and hg cp
  + unsorted
    * debugrevlog: fix average size computation for empty data (issue6167)
    * Fix an obscure data corruption bug with musl libc 
      (and presumably others).

    * commit: allow --interactive to work again when naming a directory (issue6131)
  + unsorted
    * manifest: avoid corruption by dropping removed files with pure (issue5801)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 15 13:32:38 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 5.0
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.

  + New Features
    * Python 3 Support (Beta)
    * `ui.relative-paths` option for getting relative path output from most 
      commands. This is enabled when `ui.tweakdefaults` is enabled.
    * `expectsize()` revset errors out if revset has unexpected number 
      of elements.
    * `config()` template function for getting a config value.
    * `{negrev}` template keyword shows the negative revision number. This is 
      convenient because it is usually shorter than the positive number, but 
      note that it is less stable.
    * `hg uncommit` now has an `--allow-dirty-working-copy` option.
    * `hg shelve` now has `--keep` option, which shelves but also leaves the 
      working directory unchanged.
    * `hg diff` will now include specified files in subrepos.
    * `hg recover` now has a `--no-verify` option
  + Other Improvements
    * Improved color scheme for histedit's curses interface, making it more 
      consistent with the curses hunk selector.
  + Bug Fixes
    * Histedit's curse interface has improved support for non ascii characters.
  + Backwards Compatibility Changes
    * color: change color of grep.rev label (BC)
    * commit: if interactive, look elsewhere for whitespace settings (BC)
    * diff: make sure we output stat even when --git is not passed (issue4037) (BC)
    * uncommit: abort if an explicitly given file cannot be uncommitted (BC)

- Mercurial 4.9.1
  A regularly scheduled bugfix release, late due to vacations and similar
  disruptions at the regular time.

  * commands
    + record: prevent commits that don't pick up dirty subrepo
      changes (issue6102)
  * extensions
    + rebase: add missing dashes in help text
  * unsorted
    + subrepo: avoid false unsafe path detection on Windows
    + test-https: add some more known failure messages of client
      certs (issue6030)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  1 22:19:10 UTC 2019 - Andrei Dziahel <develop7@develop7.info>

- Mercurial 4.9
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.
  See complete changelog at
  https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_4.9_.282019-02-01.29

  * Security Fixes
    It was possible to use symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's
    path-checking logic and write files outside a repository. This has been
    fixed. Users on older versions can either disable subrepositories witt
    ```
    [subrepos]
    allowed = false
    ```
    in their configuration or by ensuring any cloned repositories don't
    contain malicious symlinks.
  * New Features
    + 'hg histedit' will now present a curses UI if curses is available and
      'ui.interface' or 'ui.interface.histedit' is set to 'curses'.
    + The 'sparse-revlog' delta strategy is enabled by default for new
      repositories. See `hg help config.format.sparse-revlog` for details.
  * Other Notable Features
    + New `rewrite.update-timestamp=True` option to update the commit
      timestamp on history editing (e.g. amend.)
    + New `ui.message-output=stderr` option for scripting, which prevents
      status messages from interleaved.
    + New `rootglob:` filename pattern for a glob that is rooted at the root
      of the repository. See `hg help patterns` and `hg help hgignore` for
      details.
    + Some more reimplementation of ancestry algorithms in Rust for better
      performance.
  * Backwards Compatibility Changes
    + Boolean options passed to the logtoprocess extension are now formatted
      as "0" or "1" instead of "None", "False", or "True".
    + The logtoprocess extension no longer supports invalid "ui.log()"
      arguments. A log message is always formatted and passed in to the
      "$MSG1" environment variable.
  * Internal API Changes
    + Status messages may be sent to a dedicated stream depending on
      configuration. Don't use "ui.status()", etc. as a shorthand for
      conditional writes. Use "ui.write()" for data output.
    + Add 'exthelper' class to simplify extension writing by allowing
      functions, commands, and configitems to be registered via annotations.
      The previous APIs are still available for use.
    + The extension hook "extsetup" without a 'ui' argument has been
      deprecated, and will be removed in the next version. Add a 'ui' argument
      to avoid the deprecation warning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  7 08:10:06 UTC 2018 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.5.2

  (4.5.2 was released immediately after 4.5.1 to fix a release oversight.)
  
  1. Security Fixes (CVE-2018-1000132,bsc#1085211)
    All versions of Mercurial prior to 4.5.2 have vulnerabilities in the HTTP 
    server that allow permissions bypass to:
    * Perform writes on repositories that should be read-only
    * Perform reads on repositories that shouldn't allow read access
  
  2. Backwards Compatibility Changes
    The "batch" wire protocol command now enforces permissions of each invoked 
    sub-command. Wire protocol commands must define their operation type or the 
    "batch" command will assume they can write data and will prevent their 
    execution on HTTP servers unless the HTTP request method is POST, the 
    server is configured to allow pushes, and the (possibly authenticated) HTTP 
    user is authorized to perform a push.
    Wire protocol commands not defining their operation type in 
    "wireproto.PERMISSIONS" are now assumed to be used for "push" operations 
    and access control to run those commands is now enforced accordingly.
    
  3. Bug Fixes
    fileset: don't abort when running copied() on a revision with a removed file
    date: fix parsing months
    setup: only allow Python 3 from a source checkout (issue5804)
    annotate: do not poorly split lines at CR (issue5798)
    subrepo: don't attempt to share remote sources (issue5793)
    subrepo: activate clone pooling to enable sharing with remote URLs
    changegroup: do not delta lfs revisions
    revlog: do not use delta for lfs revisions
    revlog: resolve lfs rawtext to vanilla rawtext before applying delta

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb  4 19:11:49 UTC 2018 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.5
  
  See full changelog on 
  https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/WhatsNew#Mercurial_4.5-rc_.282018-01-22.29
  
  1. New Features
    1.1. revert --interactive
      The revert command now accepts the flag --interactive to allow reverting 
      only some of the changes to the specified files.
    1.2. Accessing hidden changesets
      Set config option `experimental.directaccess = True` to access hidden 
      changesets from read only commands.
    1.3. githelp extension
      The githelp extension provides the `hg githelp` command. This command 
      attempts to convert a git command to its Mercurial equivalent. The 
      extension can be useful to Git users new to Mercurial.
    1.4. Largefiles changes
      largefiles: add a 'debuglfput' command to put largefile into the store
      largefiles: add support for 'largefiles://' url scheme
      largefiles: allow to run 'debugupgraderepo' on repo with largefiles
      largefiles: convert EOL of hgrc before appending to bytes IO
      largefiles: explicitly set the source and sink types to 'hg' for lfconvert
      largefiles: modernize how capabilities are added to the wire protocol
  2. hgweb changes
    hgweb now shows more information about commits: phase (if it's not public), 
    obsolescence status (with a short explanation and links to the successors) 
    and instabilities (e.g. orphan, phase-divergent or content-divergent).
    Client-side graph code has been simplified by delegating more work to the 
    backend, so /graph page is now more in sync with /log page, visually and 
    feature-wise. Unfortunately, this code change means that 3rd-party themes 
    for 4.5+ are required to have graphentry.tmpl template available (copy it 
    from the base theme if you don't use %include and then reference it in map 
    file) and render entries in graph.tmpl -- look at one of the core themes to 
    see what it needs to look like. JS functions that create graph vertices and 
    edges are now available in Graph.prototype, making it possible to call the 
    original functions from custom theme-specific functions if needed.
    Graph now shows different symbols for normal, branch-closing, obsolete and 
    unstable commits, and marks currently checked out commit with a circle 
    around its graph node.
    There's also now json-graph API endpoint that can be used for rendering 
    commit graph in 3rd-party applications.
  2.1. Other Changes
    When interactive revert is run against a revision other than the working 
    directory parent, the diff shown is the diff to _apply_ to the working 
    directory, rather than the diff to _discard_ from the working copy. This is 
    in line with related user experiences with 'git' and appears to be less 
    confusing with 'ui.interface=curses'.
    Let 'hg rebase' avoid content-divergence by skipping obsolete changesets 
    (and their descendants) when they are present in the rebase set along with 
    one of their successors but none of their successors is in destination.
    A new experimental config flag, `rebase.experimental.inmemory`, makes 
    rebase perform an in-memory merge instead of doing it on-disk in the 
    working copy.
    The `HGPLAINEXCEPT` environment variable can now include color to allow 
    automatic output colorization in otherwise automated environments.
    A new `unamend` command in `uncommit` extension which undoes the effect of 
    the amend command by creating a new changeset which was there before amend 
    and moving the changes that were amended to the working directory.
    A '--abort' flag to merge command to abort the ongoing merge.
    An experimental flag '--rev' to 'hg branch' which can be used to change 
    branch of changesets.
    bundle2 read I/O significantly improved
    bundle2 memory use significantly reduced during read
    clonebundle: it is now possible to serve the clonebundle using a git-lfs 
    compatible server.
    templatefilters: add slashpath() to convert path separator to slash 
    (issue5572)
    A new experimental config flag, 'inline-color-diff', adds within-line color 
    diff capacity
    histedit: add support to output nodechanges using formatter to help with 
    editor integrations
  3. Backwards Compatibility Changes
    `log --follow-first -rREV`, which is deprecated, now follows the first 
    parent of merge revisions from the specified REV just like 
    `log --follow -rREV`.
    `log --follow -rREV FILE..` now follows file history across copies and 
    renames.
    transaction: register summary callbacks only at start of transaction
    hgweb's graph view no longer supports browsers that lack <canvas> support
    hgweb: only include graph-related data in jsdata variable on /graph pages
    graphlog: add another graph node type, unstable, using character *
    remove: print message for each file in verbose mode only while using '-A'

- Mercurial 4.4.1

  1. Notable changes
    * Git and Subversion subrepos have been disabled by default to mitigate a 
      potential security risk if files overlapping with a subrepo managed to be 
      committed to a repository.
      bsc#1071715 CVE-2017-17458
    * Subrepos are now more paranoid about symlink traversal.
    * The share extension handles drive letters on Windows better.
  
  It is possible that a specially malformed repository can cause Git 
  subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update 
  script checked in to the repository in Mercurial 4.4 and earlier. Typical use 
  of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be 
  created programmatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  5 10:56:38 UTC 2017 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.4
  
  Notable changes
    Control whitespace settings for annotation on hgweb
    
    * /annotate URLs on hgweb now accept query string arguments to influence how 
      whitespace changes impact results.
    * The arguments "ignorews," "ignorewsamount," "ignorewseol," and 
      "ignoreblanklines" now have the same meaning as their [annotate] config 
      section counterparts. Any provided setting overrides the server default.
    * HTML checkboxes have been added to the paper and gitweb themes to expose 
      current whitespace settings and to easily modify the current view.
    Fast, heuristic copy-tracing
      A new fast heuristic algorithm for copytracing which assumes that the 
      files moves are either:
        1. renames in the same directory
        2. moves in other directories with same names
      You can use this algorithm by setting 'experimental.copytrace=heuristics'. 
      This setting performs full copytracing if both source and destination 
      branches contains non-public changesets only.
    Other changes
      * Estimated time is more accurate with non-linear progress
      * "hg status -v" can now show unfinished state. For example, when in an 
        unfinished rebase state, "hg status -v" might show:
            # The repository is in an unfinished *rebase* state.
            # No unresolved merge conflicts.
            # To continue:                hg rebase --continue
            # To abort:                   hg rebase --abort
      * Added '--ignore-space-at-eol' diff option to ignore whitespace 
        differences at line endings.
      * show: use consistent node length in views
      * show: decrease minimum displayed hash length from 5 to 4
      * A new uncommit extension which provides 'hg uncommit' using which one 
        can uncommit part or all of the changeset. This command undoes the 
        effect of a local commit, returning the affected files to their 
        uncommitted state.
      * 'hg clone --uncompressed' uses clone bundles when possible
      * 'hg annotate --skip' now prints a '*' on lines with skipped revisions
      * New 'commands.update.check' feature to adjust constraints on when 
        'hg update' will allow updates with a dirty working copy.
      * Add an experimental -L/--line-range FILE,FROMLINE:TOLINE option to 
        'hg log' command to follow the history of files by line range. In 
        combination with -p/--patch option, only diff hunks within specified 
        line range will be displayed. Feedback, especially on UX aspects, is 
        welcome.
      * Print warning when fsmonitor isn't being used on a large repository

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 15 14:26:18 CEST 2017 - tiwai@suse.de

- Mercurial 4.3.1:
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release,
  including the previous two security fixes (CVE-2017-1000115,
  CVE-2017-1000116)

  Notable changes:
  * experimental amend extension providing the amend command
  * experimental sparse extension
  * Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped.
  * Bundles created by the strip extension now store phase
    information. It will be restored when unbundling.
  * The strip extension now removes relevant obsmarkers.
    If a backup requested (the default), the obsmarkers are stored
    in the backup bundle and will be restored when unbundling.
  * hg show work (from the experimental show extension) now
    displays more info
  * hg show stack is a new view for the current, in-progress
    changeset and others around it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 10 22:58:59 CEST 2017 - tiwai@suse.de

- mercurial 4.2.3: security fix updates for 
  CVE-2017-1000115 and CVE-2017-1000116:
  * Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and
    could be abused to write to files outside the repository
    (CVE-2017-1000115 bsc#1053344)
  * Mercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing
    shell injection attacks by specifying a hostname starting with
    -oProxyCommand (CVE-2017-1000116, bsc#1052696)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  5 19:37:07 UTC 2017 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.2.2
  This is a regularly-scheduled bugfix release.
  
  * largefiles: avoid a crash when archiving a subrepo with largefiles disabled
  * rebase: also test abort from pretxnclose error
  * rebase: backed out changes 2519994d25ca and cf8ad0e6c0e4 (issue5610)
  * rebase: reinforce testing around precommit hook interrupting a rebase

- Mercurial 4.2.1
  This is a regularly-scheduled bugfix release.

  * `hg graft` now works when grafting across merges that were problematic 
    before (b4e1e30528c7).
  * A race condition in `hg status` was partially fixed (issue5584).
  * The message about deprecated SHA-1 hashes in the [hostfingerprints] config 
    section now references the correct syntax for replacing them with SHA-256 
    hashes (issue5559).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  7 09:12:06 UTC 2017 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.2
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.

  * Notable changes
    + Pager support has been moved into core and is now enabled by default. 
      This is now controlled with the ui.paginate setting.
      Note that in 4.2-rc, the ui.paginate option was named pager.enable. The 
      old name has been dropped in the final release. If you had turned 
      pagination off using pager.enable=False, please update your config.
    + Color support has also been moved into core and is now enabled by default 
      (the ui.color setting now defaults to 'auto').
    + The new experimental 'show' extension provides a way to view various 
      information about your repository in an ergonomic way. It is deliberately 
      designed for human consumption and not for scripting, so it doesn't carry 
      the same backward compatibility guarantees as other commands. See 
      'hg help -e show' for more information.
    + Mercurial now requires `setuptools` on Windows

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  4 17:29:18 UTC 2017 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.1.2
  This is a regularly-scheduled bugfix release.

  + Mercurial should work inside IIS on Windows again. (issue5493)
  + zstd support now refuses to work on old bundle formats. (issue5506)
  + Merges involving subrepositories no longer crash in some cases. (issue5505)
  + Checking for new heads during push is no longer accidentally quadratic

- Mercurial 4.1.1
  This is a regularly-scheduled bugfix release.

  + Several incorrect mailing list addresses have been corrected.
  + Various error cases have been corrected during push and pull.
  + Minor issues that happened when Mercurial spawned worker processes have 
    been fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 20:59:31 UTC 2017 - develop7@develop7.info

- Mercurial 4.1
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release.
  
  + Features
    * A new extensible "compression engines" API has been implemented. Support 
      for a new compression format can now be implemented in extensions.
    * New compression formats are fully supported in bundles and the wire 
      protocol. There is experimental support for different compression in 
      revlogs.
    * zstd - a new and exciting compression engine - is now distributed with 
      Mercurial and built by default
    * HTTP payloads for many commands will now use zstd by default (as opposed 
      to zlib) when both client and server support it. This can reduce 
      server-side CPU usage to ~60% of original for operations like serving 
      bundles.
    * zstd compressed bundles can be produced by specifying the `zstd` bundle 
      type. e.g. `hg bundle -a -t zstd-v2 zstd-bundle.hg`.
    * A new statistical profiler has been added and made the default profiler 
      for `--profile`. This profiler gives more accurate results than Python's 
      built-in cProfile (the previous default) because the profiler overhead is 
      much smaller. The output from `--profile` now displays the code hot path 
      by default. This allows Mercurial developers to more accurately identify 
      performance problems.
    * New `followlines(file, from:to, startrev=.)` revset predicate to track a 
      part of changes.
    * Experimental support for additional git-diff features.
    * Troubled changes (from ChangesetEvolution) are noted more prominently in a few places.
    * An experimental hg debugupgraderepo command allows in-place upgrading of 
      repositories to the latest storage format.
  + Improvements
    * Performance of reading individual revlog entries has been greatly 
      improved. This will be noticeable when performing changelog scans on 
      large repositories (such as when executing certain revsets).
    * The low-level content diffing algorithm is now ~2x faster. Operations 
      that write data to the repository (like commit) can be noticeably faster 
      as a result.

- Mercurial 4.0
  This is a regularly-scheduled quarterly feature release. Unlike other 
  4.0 software releases, this is simply 3.9 + .1, so it should be the usual 
  pain-free upgrade.
  
  + Features
    * The following commands now also have experimental formatter support: 
      'hg version', 'hg grep' and 'hg config'
    * New template keywords and functions: `termwidth`, `mod(a, b)`, 
      `relpath(path)`
    * Basic arithmetic operations in template such as `termwidth - 10`
    * `follow()` revset takes new `startrev` parameter
    * Bash completion now allows skipping potentially expensive status call 
      for completing 'hg status' arguments, using $HGCOMPLETE_NOSTATUS 
      environment variable
  + Improvements
    * A number of changes were made to move and copy tracking, to make sure 
      move and copy information is not lost during commands like 'hg graft'
    * Compound revset expression is now properly ordered
    * Python 3 support has received a lot of improvements (but will take a 
      lot of additional work)
    * zlib performance in hgweb is improved, and it's possible to control zlib 
      compression level using server.zliblevel option
- Refreshed mercurial-hgk-path-fix.diff and mercurial-locale-path-fix.patch

    * chg now detects more changes to the configuration and execution 
      environment
    * SSL/TLS code has been significantly refactored and now is consistent 
      across all consumers (HTTPS, SMTPS)
    * performance improvements to server communication (particularly for the 
      largefiles and remotefilelog extensions)
    * connections to servers whose certificate authority (CA) is unknown are

- fix mercurial-locale-fix.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  2 19:13:38 UTC 2016 - develop7@develop7.info

- update to v3.8.1
  (3.8.1 was released immediately after 3.8 to fix a release oversight.)
  Regularly scheduled feature release. This release contains a low-priority security fix for:
    * CVE-2016-3105 Mercurial: arbitrary code execution when converting Git repos
  
  Features
  * `hg update` and other commands that can perform update (such as hg pull -u) 
    now warn about other topological heads
  * cHg has been added
  * `hg update` now updates to the tip-most changeset on the same topological 
    branch. Before, it would update to the tip-most changeset, possibly on a 
    different topological head
  * Hints on how to continue interrupted commands are now printed 
    (e.g. `hg resolve -m` will now tell you to run `hg rebase --continue` or 
    `hg histedit --continue`)
  * The experimental automv extension has been added. This extension attempts 
    to detect file copes and renames automatically.
  * The 3rd party hgwatchman extension has been imported as the fsmonitor 
    extension. This extension uses filesystem watching to make commands like 
    `hg status` significantly faster on large repositories.
  * `hg rebase` now chooses its default destination the same way `hg merge` does
  * `hg pull -u` now activates a bookmark if the has a bookmark
  * `hg pull -u` now deactivates a bookmark if the destination doesn't match 
    the existing bookmark
  * Improved edge styles in graph log.
  * User template keywords and functions can be defined in `[templatealias]` 
    section.
  * It's now possible to push the active bookmark using `hg push -B .`.
  
  Improvements
  This release includes many improvements, including (but not limited to):
  * performance of copy detection during rebases has been improved, potentially 
    leading to faster rebase execution
  * performance of `hg log -f <file>` has been improved
  * syntax errors in loaded extensions are now handled better
  * `hg update` on Windows should now be up to 4x faster
  * JSON encoding should now be proper UTF-8 for all inputs
  * Performance of the - revset operator has been improved
  * The blackbox extension now logs more data
  * "hgext" is now a Python namespace package
  * revsets accessing changelog data (commit messages, authors, dates) are now 
    10-15% faster
  * hg.exe built in MinGW will now link against the proper Python DLL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 30 13:18:23 UTC 2016 - develop7@develop7.info

- update to v3.7.3
  This is an out of cycle release to address three security issues:
  * CVE-2016-3630 Mercurial: remote code execution in binary delta decoding
    Mercurial prior to 3.7.3 contained two bounds-checking errors in its binary 
    delta decoder that may be exploitable via clone, push, or pull.
  * CVE-2016-3068 Mercurial: arbitrary code execution with Git subrepos
    Mercurial prior to 3.7.3 allowed URLs for Git subrepos that could result in 
    arbitrary code execution on clone. This is a further side-effect of Git 
    CVE-2015-7545. Reported by Blake Burkhart.
  * CVE-2016-3069 Mercurial: arbitrary code execution when converting Git repos
    Mercurial prior to 3.7.3 allowed arbitrary code execution when converting 
    Git repos with hostile names. This could affect automated conversion 
    services. Reported by Blake Burkhart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  2 14:54:14 UTC 2016 - develop7@develop7.info

- update to v3.7
  * Features
    + Generaldelta: the original Mercurial compression format had an inefficient way of storing history in very branchy
      repositories. Generaldelta addresses this weakness. As a result, depending on the repository, this can improve
      the size of the history up to a factor of 10. Mercurial 1.9 was the first release to support generaldelta
      (behind a feature flag), but Mercurial 3.7 also allows pulling a mixture of non-generaldelta and generaldelta
      history without having to recompute everything, which avoids overloading servers. As a result, generaldelta is
      now enabled by default. You can convert a repository to generaldelta using:
      `hg clone -U --config format.generaldelta=1 --pull originalrepo generaldeltarepo`
    + Clonebundles: this is an server-side extension. It allows using a pre-generated bundle for an initial Mercurial
      clone. Clients will automatically use clonebundles if a server advertises them. Clonebundles allows much faster
      initial clones and reduces the load on a central server significantly. Mercurial 3.6 was the first version to
      include experimental clonebundles support, it's now been marked non-experimental. You can find out more using:
      `hg help clonebundles`.
    + Filesets now support 'missing()', to specify all files missing according to `hg status`.
    + Interactive committing (`hg commit -i`) and amending (`hg commit --amend`) can now be used together.
    + Merging can now handle collisions between untracked and tracked files, configurable according to the config
      option `merge.checkunknown`.
    + Default 'histedit' destination: it's now possible to run `hg histedit` without specifying a base revision.
      Mercurial will try to determine an appropriate base automatically. The revset used for this is
      "`reverse(only(.) and not public() and not ::merge())`", which specifies the first ancestor of the current
      changeset that is not public and does not have any descendants that are merges.
    + The '*.orig' files created by revert can now be stored in a different location, specified by the config option
      `ui.origbackuppath`.
    + `hg shelve` now supports storing untracked files.
    + `hg unshelve` now supports using a custom merge tool.
    + `hg backout` now commits by default if no conflicts were encountered.
    + hgweb now supports rendering sub-topics.
    + Server operators can now limit interaction with legacy clients speaking an outdated wire protocol. This is useful
      for preventing excessive CPU use when the server is using generaldelta repositories. See the various `bundle1`
      options in `hg help config.server`.
    + Python wheel packages are now available for Windows on PyPI
    + `[paths]` entries can now define a separate URL for pushes. See `hg help config.paths` for more.
  * Improvements
    This release includes many improvements, including (but not limited to):
    + performance improvements (speedup for '`hg log <file/folder>`')
    + many documentation improvements (clarification, additional examples (see `hg help <command> --verbose`), ...)
    + improved PyPy support
    + `hg clone --uncompressed` is now 3-4x faster on Windows. See the `backgroundclose*` options in
      `hg help config.worker` for more.
