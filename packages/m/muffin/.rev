- Update to version 3.8.2:
  * utils: Fix zenity dialogue - don't use monospace for the
    heading, don't italicise the info text, force a wider dialogue
    window.
  * window.c: Change behaviour of meta_window_get_all_monitors()
    to return only those monitors of a fullscreen window that are
    completely covered by the window.
  * screen.c: Ignore dock-type windows when determining fullscreen
    window coverage on a monitor.
  * window.c: Queue a fullscreen check when a window leaves a
    monitor.
  * window: Move legacy fullscreen workaround out of constraints
    and into meta_window_move_resize_request.
  * window.c: Set the &quot;saved_maximize&quot; internal state based on the
    resulting state of the window after a maximize call, not the
    directions that were requested for the call.
  * window.c: Always use the full window extents (including
    invisible) when running meta_window_get_all_monitors() on CSD
    windows.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Default to using shadows on windows.
  * Software rendering: Don't remove shadows.
  * screen.c: Ignore transient windows when working through the
    stack figuring out if a monitor is fullscreened or not.
  * window-props.c: When reloading the transient_for property, if
    the given window id is not found, search existing windows'
    client leader ids for a match, and assign the match's window as
    the transient parent instead (this seems to be typical for Qt
    applications).
- Update to version 3.8.1:
  * prefs: Fix introspection for meta_prefs_get_button_layout().
  * Remove META_LAYER_FULLSCREEN.
  * Make MetaButtonLayout usable from introspection.
  * screen.c: Redefine a fullscreen monitor as one where there is a
    fullscreen window and that window is the topmost there.
- Update to version 3.8.0:
  * Remove gsettings key org.cinnamon.muffin button-layout.
  * Fix an issue where window turns to a solid coloured rectangle
    during the destroy animation.
  * window: Stop updating layers on focus changes.
  * window: Do not unfocus on new window.
  * window.c: always notify when tile-type property changes.
  * Fixes workspace animation direction for grid systems.
  * window-props.c: Don't scale GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS, it comes
    already-scaled from Gtk (as of GTK+ 3.15.1).
  * MetaWindow: Support gtk edge constraints (restores csd-window
    resizing while tiled or snapped.)
  * atomnames.h: Move xapp atoms to non-EWMH list (they're actually
    named wrong but it's sort of late now).
  * window.c: catch X errors when setting gtk constraints.
    An error can occur when closing a tiled csd window.
    It's likely that because of how closing occurs on these type
    windows (we respond to it, we don't initiate it) that the XID
    may be invalid by the time we move to update its properties.
  * meta-window-group: Report a paint volume.
  * meta-background: Report a paint volume.
- Update to version 3.6.0:
  * x11/xprops: Plug a memory leak.
  * Remove old things from the initial fork that seem not needed.
- Update to version 3.4.1:
  * Allow keyboard window switching (alt-Tab) during drag-and-drop.
  * Don't add invisible resize borders to fullscreen windows.
  * Fix a crash when toplevel windows were set to unexpected
    window types.
  * Correct problems with windows moving when restarting or
    switching window managers.
  * Fix interaction of tiled windows with multiple monitors.
  * Make meta_display_unmanage_screen() public.
  * Fix a problem with turning off window decorations on the fly.
  * Fix spurious assertion failures with themes such as Nodoka.
  * Misc. bug fixes.
- Update to version 3.4.0:
  * Change to sys/wait.h
  * Make meta_workspace_get_work_area_for_monitor public and
    introspectable.
  * Fix meta_screen_get_monitor_geometry override redirect
    (gh#linuxmint#muffin#283).
- Update to version 3.2.2:
  * Make background transitions configurable.
- Update to version 3.2.1:
  * window groups: Don't assign IM popups to META_WINDOW_POPUP_MENU.
- Update to version 3.2.0:
  * meta-window-actor: Fix unredirect heuristic Damage coordinates
    are relative to the drawable not to the screen. So we have to
    check whether x and y are 0 and not window_rect.x/y otherwise
    the herustic will never trigger for windows on monitors whos x
    and y are not 0.
  * meta-window-actor: Consider needs_destroy in is_destroyed().
    According to the documentation, the method returns &quot;whether the
    X window that the actor was displaying has been destroyed&quot; -
    that is very much true when we delay the actual actor
    destruction for a destroy animation, so update the method
    accordingly.
  * meta-window-actor: Do not request unredirection when destroyed
    WindowActors can outlive their corresponding window to animate
    unmap. Unredirecting the actor does not make sense in that
    case, so make sure to not request it.
  * window-actor: Skip frame-sync when the corresponding window
    is gone.
  * Migrate away from gnome-common deprecated vars and macros.
  * meta-window-actor: Change unredirection hints to match spec
    changes.
  * x11/window-props: Initialise the bypass compositor hint.
  * backgrounds: Add a simple crossfade effect on bg transitions,.
  * backgrounds: Clean up a couple things.
  * compositor: Clean up a bunch of deprecated clutter
    functionality.
  * wm-tester: Clean up gtk deprecations.
  * Remove old references to tooltips.
  * frames: Remove expose_delayed.
  * Don't remove client-side frame extents when maximizing
    (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#5343).
  * Add screen signal for skip_taskbar window hint changes.
    This is needed by the window list applet in Cinnamon to know
    when to remove (or add) an item in the window list.
  * cogl-utils.c: Don't skip error parameters.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Only override the unredirect heuristic
    with our unredirect-fullscreen-windows preference.
  * Make AX_ macros optional.
- Update to version 3.0.5:
  * cogl-utils: Don't set such a tight restriction on texture sizes.
  * keybindings.c: Fix alignment calculation for handle_move_to -
    it was not accounting for GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS in the final x,y
    position.
  * window.c: Temporary workaround for gtk3 tooltip position bug
    and Gtk 3.18.
- Update to version 3.0.4:
  * Use g_clear_pointer to clean up finalisation code.
  * window-actor: Remove custom region destruction methods with
    g_clear_pointer.
  * constraints.c: Ignore snapped windows whe maximising desktop
    windows.
  * window-actor: Fix leaked frame list.
- Update to version 3.0.3 (changes since 3.0.1):
  * window.c: Handle META_TILE_MAXIMIZE in update_tile_mode, and
    move its call to handle both moving and resizing. This
    prevents strange resize behaviour when you move a window to an
    upper tile region without tiling it. Its tile state becomes
    inconsistent, and an attempt to resize it vertically ends up
    resizing in the wrong (or both) directions.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Put META_WINDOW_DND-type windows in the
    regular window group (xdndHandler.js in cinnamon expects it
    there).
- Update to version 3.0.1:
  * display.c: Handle META_TILE_MAXIMIZE in
    meta_resize_gravity_from_tile_mode().
  * tiling: Fix resizing of partially maximised windows.
  * frames.c: Do not infinite loop on the variants GList.
    Make variable names less similar.
- Update to version 3.0.0:
  * tiling: Wait to update window properties on tiled windows until
    after the window has been resized.
  * tiling: Remove the tiling property when a window is no longer
    tiled.
  * tiling: Remove a redundant check in the tiling keyboard handler.
  * window.c: Fix maximisation state when using tile hotkeys, clean
    up tile flags fully when the window is restored to normal.
  * tiling:  Fix mouse/keyboard resizing.
  * Enable tiling from a non-drag-initiated mouse move (for
    instance, via hotkey or titlebar menu).
  * keybindings.c: Get correct gravity during keyboard resize.
  * window.c: Don't animate the end of a tile resizing.
  * core: Assume we always have a compositor.
  * muffin.c: Fix executable from crashing when x11 isn't
    explicitly set as the clutter backend. We do this for Cinnamon
    itself in Cinnamon's main.c - it needs to be set before
    g_type_init.
  * theme.c: Get style context state instead of using
    GTK_STATE_FLAG_NORMAL, Gtk 3.20+ complains if the state passed
    doesn't match the context's current state. This quiets a lot of
    log spam when window focus changes.
  * window.c: Don't send configure notifies for OR windows this
    causes popup placement issues with Gtk 3.20+, the assertion is
    left out, as we still need to send configure notifies for OR
    windows in other cases.
  * prefs: Remove the live-hidden-windows preference.
    It's hardcoded to TRUE anyway.
  * Pull some upstream changes for mapping and unmapping windows.
  * compositor: Rework handling of our top_window_group.
  * Improve tracking of fullscreen windows.
  * Fix ppc64el packages build.
  * Removed unneeded postinst and prerm files.
- Rename and rebase muffin-2.4.0-SVID_SOURCE.patch to
  muffin-svid-default-source.patch.
- Update to 2.8.5:
  * tiling: Account for gtk frame extents when evaluating whether a
    c-s-d window can be tiled or not.
  * prefs.c: Update keybindings even when the new keybinding is
    empty - this prevents old built-in (muffin) keybindings from
    continuing to work even after they've been cleared.
  * prefs: Don't attach modal dialogs by default.
  * cogl wrappers: Perform a sanity check on the width/height
    request and clamp the sizes to a maximum of (x) screen size.
  * display.c: prevent assertion errors when clicking out of
    window menus.
  * Disable frame sync when used when OpenGL version used by the
    driver is &lt; 3.0.
  * meta-sync-ring.c: Simplify openGL version check to only check
    the major version number. Make the COGL_DRIVER_GL check a bit
    safer.
- Update to 2.8.4:
  * meta-window-actor.c: Remove duplicate call to
    meta_window_get_input_rect().
- Require cinnamon-gschemas.
- Update to 2.8.3:
  * Remove invalid (transfer) annnotations.
  * keybindings: make rebuilding keybindings an idle function.
    Prior to this, meta_display_rebuild_keybindings was called
    around 60 times at startup on my more-or-less stock desktop.
    Now it is called approximately once, as an idle function,
    after all keybinding changes are complete.
- Update to 2.8.2:
  * Rework the strut handling code to better handle stacked monitor
    situations.
  * keybindings: Currently our move-to-center keybinding respects
    the current location of the mouse cursor when placing the
    window. Change the other move-window-to-* keybindings to match
    this behaviour. Also fixes issues with window being placed
    incorrectly with regards to the panel on multi-monitors with
    mixed panel layouts.
- Update to 2.8.1:
  * constraints: clean up an unused variable.
  * Attach modal windows by default.
- Update to 2.8.0:
  * screen.c: Fix toggle-desktop behaviour.
  * Fix some warnings.
  * compositor.c: Handle unstable API break.
  * Implement frame sync between apps and compositor.
  * Add meta-sync-ring and nvidia patch.
  * main.c: remove incorrect comment.
  * Keybindings: Change how the &quot;Center window is screen&quot; hotkey
    works so it centers the window on the proper screen in multiple
    monitor setups and matches the placement of centered, newly
    opened windows.
  * screen: Add a public meta_screen_get_current_monitor().
    A convenience function for getting the current monitor index
    for the cursor. Helpful when implementing features with proper
    multiple monitor support.
  * Center attached dialogs on the parent window instead of the
    parents titlebar.
  * Pull some upstream fixes from Mutter to allow getting/setting
    a windows icon geometry. This will allow us to get a proper
    working minimise effect when using multiple panel applets.
- Add missing zenity dependency.
- Spec cleanup.
- update to version 2.6.1
- update to version 2.4.5
- update version 2.4.1
  * re-add keybindings schema to allow cinnamon-desktop migration 
    script to work
- update version 2.4.0
- add patch: muffin-2.4.0-SVID_SOURCE.patch
  * _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated, use _DEFAULT_SOURCE
- drop openSUSE 12.3 support, it's going to EOL
- update version 2.3.0
  * Send destroy events for minimized, attached windows to Cinnamon, 
    so the parent un-dimming can occur.

  * Don't break scrolling when 'special key to move windows' is disabled.
  * Ensure steam notifications appear over the panel.
- use a special tarball for openSUSE 12.3
  * muffin master adopt many GNOME 3.10+ changes for Hi-DPI support.
    while openSUSE 12.3 ships 3.8
- added patch: muffin-cogl-api.patch
  * fix api breaks in openSUSE 12.3

- update version 2.2.5
- update version 2.2.4
- update version 2.2.3
- update version 2.2.2
- update version 2.2.1

  * Real fix for double frame decorations when resizing corner-tiled windows
  * Revert &quot;Temporary hack for resized corner-tiled window frame issues on themes&quot;
  * Fix for desktop modal dialogs being centered on the workspace instead of the primary monitor.
  * Fix unescapable fullscreen in chrome/chromium. 
  * Revert &quot;Partial fix for errant tooltips - fixes all cases except nemo views&quot;
  * Partial fix for errant tooltips - fixes all cases except nemo views
  * Temporary hack for resized corner-tiled window frame issues on themes 
    that support tiling... this results in a gradually growing window if you
    resize repeatedly, but for now it prevents average users from getting the
    dreaded 'double frame'.  Still not sure what's causing.
  * Stop-gap fix for stuttered resizing of gtk3 windows.
  * Don't apply snapping rules to maximized windows when they're in a different workspace. 
- update version 2.0.4
  *Improve frame styling for snapped/tiled windows in themes that support it
- 2.0.3
  *Only perform workspace switch on drag during a mouse drag. Fixes #2513

    window.
  * window.c: Change behaviour of meta_window_get_all_monitors()
    to return only those monitors of a fullscreen window that are
    completely covered by the window.
  * screen.c: Ignore dock-type windows when determining fullscreen
    window coverage on a monitor.
  * window.c: Queue a fullscreen check when a window leaves a
    monitor.
  * window: Move legacy fullscreen workaround out of constraints
    and into meta_window_move_resize_request.
  * window.c: Set the &quot;saved_maximize&quot; internal state based on the
    resulting state of the window after a maximize call, not the
    directions that were requested for the call.
  * window.c: Always use the full window extents (including
    invisible) when running meta_window_get_all_monitors() on CSD
    windows.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Default to using shadows on windows.
  * Software rendering: Don't remove shadows.
  * screen.c: Ignore transient windows when working through the
    stack figuring out if a monitor is fullscreened or not.
  * window-props.c: When reloading the transient_for property, if
    the given window id is not found, search existing windows'
    client leader ids for a match, and assign the match's window as
    the transient parent instead (this seems to be typical for Qt
    applications).
- Update to version 3.8.1:
  * prefs: Fix introspection for meta_prefs_get_button_layout().
  * Remove META_LAYER_FULLSCREEN.
  * Make MetaButtonLayout usable from introspection.
  * screen.c: Redefine a fullscreen monitor as one where there is a
    fullscreen window and that window is the topmost there.
- Update to version 3.8.0:
  * Remove gsettings key org.cinnamon.muffin button-layout.
  * Fix an issue where window turns to a solid coloured rectangle
    during the destroy animation.
  * window: Stop updating layers on focus changes.
  * window: Do not unfocus on new window.
  * window.c: always notify when tile-type property changes.
  * Fixes workspace animation direction for grid systems.
  * window-props.c: Don't scale GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS, it comes
    already-scaled from Gtk (as of GTK+ 3.15.1).
  * MetaWindow: Support gtk edge constraints (restores csd-window
    resizing while tiled or snapped.)
  * atomnames.h: Move xapp atoms to non-EWMH list (they're actually
    named wrong but it's sort of late now).
  * window.c: catch X errors when setting gtk constraints.
    An error can occur when closing a tiled csd window.
    It's likely that because of how closing occurs on these type
    windows (we respond to it, we don't initiate it) that the XID
    may be invalid by the time we move to update its properties.
  * meta-window-group: Report a paint volume.
  * meta-background: Report a paint volume.
- Update to version 3.6.0:
  * x11/xprops: Plug a memory leak.
  * Remove old things from the initial fork that seem not needed.
- Update to version 3.4.1:
  * Allow keyboard window switching (alt-Tab) during drag-and-drop.
  * Don't add invisible resize borders to fullscreen windows.
  * Fix a crash when toplevel windows were set to unexpected
    window types.
  * Correct problems with windows moving when restarting or
    switching window managers.
  * Fix interaction of tiled windows with multiple monitors.
  * Make meta_display_unmanage_screen() public.
  * Fix a problem with turning off window decorations on the fly.
  * Fix spurious assertion failures with themes such as Nodoka.
  * Misc. bug fixes.
- Update to version 3.4.0:
  * Change to sys/wait.h
  * Make meta_workspace_get_work_area_for_monitor public and
    introspectable.
  * Fix meta_screen_get_monitor_geometry override redirect
    (gh#linuxmint#muffin#283).
- Update to version 3.2.2:
  * Make background transitions configurable.
- Update to version 3.2.1:
  * window groups: Don't assign IM popups to META_WINDOW_POPUP_MENU.
- Update to version 3.2.0:
  * meta-window-actor: Fix unredirect heuristic Damage coordinates
    are relative to the drawable not to the screen. So we have to
    check whether x and y are 0 and not window_rect.x/y otherwise
    the herustic will never trigger for windows on monitors whos x
    and y are not 0.
  * meta-window-actor: Consider needs_destroy in is_destroyed().
    According to the documentation, the method returns &quot;whether the
    X window that the actor was displaying has been destroyed&quot; -
    that is very much true when we delay the actual actor
    destruction for a destroy animation, so update the method
    accordingly.
  * meta-window-actor: Do not request unredirection when destroyed
    WindowActors can outlive their corresponding window to animate
    unmap. Unredirecting the actor does not make sense in that
    case, so make sure to not request it.
  * window-actor: Skip frame-sync when the corresponding window
    is gone.
  * Migrate away from gnome-common deprecated vars and macros.
  * meta-window-actor: Change unredirection hints to match spec
    changes.
  * x11/window-props: Initialise the bypass compositor hint.
  * backgrounds: Add a simple crossfade effect on bg transitions,.
  * backgrounds: Clean up a couple things.
  * compositor: Clean up a bunch of deprecated clutter
    functionality.
  * wm-tester: Clean up gtk deprecations.
  * Remove old references to tooltips.
  * frames: Remove expose_delayed.
  * Don't remove client-side frame extents when maximizing
    (gh#linuxmint/Cinnamon#5343).
  * Add screen signal for skip_taskbar window hint changes.
    This is needed by the window list applet in Cinnamon to know
    when to remove (or add) an item in the window list.
  * cogl-utils.c: Don't skip error parameters.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Only override the unredirect heuristic
    with our unredirect-fullscreen-windows preference.
  * Make AX_ macros optional.
- Update to version 3.0.5:
  * cogl-utils: Don't set such a tight restriction on texture sizes.
  * keybindings.c: Fix alignment calculation for handle_move_to -
    it was not accounting for GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS in the final x,y
    position.
  * window.c: Temporary workaround for gtk3 tooltip position bug
    and Gtk 3.18.
- Update to version 3.0.4:
  * Use g_clear_pointer to clean up finalisation code.
  * window-actor: Remove custom region destruction methods with
    g_clear_pointer.
  * constraints.c: Ignore snapped windows whe maximising desktop
    windows.
  * window-actor: Fix leaked frame list.
- Update to version 3.0.3 (changes since 3.0.1):
  * window.c: Handle META_TILE_MAXIMIZE in update_tile_mode, and
    move its call to handle both moving and resizing. This
    prevents strange resize behaviour when you move a window to an
    upper tile region without tiling it. Its tile state becomes
    inconsistent, and an attempt to resize it vertically ends up
    resizing in the wrong (or both) directions.
  * meta-window-actor.c: Put META_WINDOW_DND-type windows in the
    regular window group (xdndHandler.js in cinnamon expects it
    there).
- Update to version 3.0.1:
  * display.c: Handle META_TILE_MAXIMIZE in
    meta_resize_gravity_from_tile_mode().
  * tiling: Fix resizing of partially maximised windows.
  * frames.c: Do not infinite loop on the variants GList.
    Make variable names less similar.
- Update to version 3.0.0:
  * tiling: Wait to update window properties on tiled windows until
    after the window has been resized.
  * tiling: Remove the tiling property when a window is no longer
    tiled.
  * tiling: Remove a redundant check in the tiling keyboard handler.
  * window.c: Fix maximisation state when using tile hotkeys, clean
    up tile flags fully when the window is restored to normal.
  * tiling:  Fix mouse/keyboard resizing.
  * Enable tiling from a non-drag-initiated mouse move (for
    instance, via hotkey or titlebar menu).
  * keybindings.c: Get correct gravity during keyboard resize.
  * window.c: Don't animate the end of a tile resizing.
  * core: Assume we always have a compositor.
  * muffin.c: Fix executable from crashing when x11 isn't
    explicitly set as the clutter backend. We do this for Cinnamon
    itself in Cinnamon's main.c - it needs to be set before
    g_type_init.
  * theme.c: Get style context state instead of using
    GTK_STATE_FLAG_NORMAL, Gtk 3.20+ complains if the state passed
    doesn't match the context's current state. This quiets a lot of
    log spam when window focus changes.
  * window.c: Don't send configure notifies for OR windows this
    causes popup placement issues with Gtk 3.20+, the assertion is
    left out, as we still need to send configure notifies for OR
    windows in other cases.
  * prefs: Remove the live-hidden-windows preference.
    It's hardcoded to TRUE anyway.
  * Pull some upstream changes for mapping and unmapping windows.
  * compositor: Rework handling of our top_window_group.
  * Improve tracking of fullscreen windows.
  * Fix ppc64el packages build.
  * Removed unneeded postinst and prerm files.
- Rename and rebase muffin-2.4.0-SVID_SOURCE.patch to
  muffin-svid-default-source.patch.
- Update to 2.8.5:
  * tiling: Account for gtk frame extents when evaluating whether a
    c-s-d window can be tiled or not.
  * prefs.c: Update keybindings even when the new keybinding is
    empty - this prevents old built-in (muffin) keybindings from
    continuing to work even after they've been cleared.
  * prefs: Don't attach modal dialogs by default.
  * cogl wrappers: Perform a sanity check on the width/height
    request and clamp the sizes to a maximum of (x) screen size.
  * display.c: prevent assertion errors when clicking out of
    window menus.
  * Disable frame sync when used when OpenGL version used by the
    driver is &lt; 3.0.
  * meta-sync-ring.c: Simplify openGL version check to only check
    the major version number. Make the COGL_DRIVER_GL check a bit
    safer.
- Update to 2.8.4:
  * meta-window-actor.c: Remove duplicate call to
    meta_window_get_input_rect().
- Require cinnamon-gschemas.
- Update to 2.8.3:
  * Remove invalid (transfer) annnotations.
  * keybindings: make rebuilding keybindings an idle function.
    Prior to this, meta_display_rebuild_keybindings was called
    around 60 times at startup on my more-or-less stock desktop.
    Now it is called approximately once, as an idle function,
    after all keybinding changes are complete.
- Update to 2.8.2:
  * Rework the strut handling code to better handle stacked monitor
    situations.
  * keybindings: Currently our move-to-center keybinding respects
    the current location of the mouse cursor when placing the
    window. Change the other move-window-to-* keybindings to match
    this behaviour. Also fixes issues with window being placed
    incorrectly with regards to the panel on multi-monitors with
    mixed panel layouts.
- Update to 2.8.1:
  * constraints: clean up an unused variable.
  * Attach modal windows by default.
- Update to 2.8.0:
  * screen.c: Fix toggle-desktop behaviour.
  * Fix some warnings.
  * compositor.c: Handle unstable API break.
  * Implement frame sync between apps and compositor.
  * Add meta-sync-ring and nvidia patch.
  * main.c: remove incorrect comment.
  * Keybindings: Change how the &quot;Center window is screen&quot; hotkey
    works so it centers the window on the proper screen in multiple
    monitor setups and matches the placement of centered, newly
    opened windows.
  * screen: Add a public meta_screen_get_current_monitor().
    A convenience function for getting the current monitor index
    for the cursor. Helpful when implementing features with proper
    multiple monitor support.
  * Center attached dialogs on the parent window instead of the
    parents titlebar.
  * Pull some upstream fixes from Mutter to allow getting/setting
    a windows icon geometry. This will allow us to get a proper
    working minimise effect when using multiple panel applets.
- Add missing zenity dependency.
- Spec cleanup.
- update to version 2.6.1

- update version 2.3.0
  * Send destroy events for minimized, attached windows to Cinnamon, 
    so the parent un-dimming can occur.

  * Don't break scrolling when 'special key to move windows' is disabled.
  * Ensure steam notifications appear over the panel.
- use a special tarball for openSUSE 12.3

  * Partial fix for errant tooltips - fixes all cases except nemo views
  * Temporary hack for resized corner-tiled window frame issues on themes 
    that support tiling... this results in a gradually growing window if you
    resize repeatedly, but for now it prevents average users from getting the
