  <title>A small window manager for Cinnamon Desktop</title>
  <description>Muffin is a small window manager, using GTK+ and Clutter to do everything. Muffin is the clutter-based evolution of Metacity, which, as the  author says, is a &quot;Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many  window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios.&quot;</description>
