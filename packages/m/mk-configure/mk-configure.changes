Thu Apr 8 19:15:11 UTC 2021 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to mk-configure-0.37.0

  Features:
    * new feature "strtoi" for NetBSD function with the same name
    * new feature "strtou" for NetBSD function with the same name
    * new feature "reallocarr" for NetBSD function with the same name
    * new feature "macro". It provides NetBSD-style macro __dead, __pure,
      __UNCONST, __printflike, __constfunc, __always_inline, __aligned,
      __arraycount, MAX and MIN
    * "efun": add support for ereallocarr(3), estrtoi(3) and estrtou(3)

  Fixes:
    * imp.foreign_autotools.mk: add MAKE=${AT_MAKE} to environment
      This fixes ./configure when "make" executable is not available
    * CXXSTD: appropriate option is passed to the linker.  This fixes
      failures with Sun C++ compiler.
    * examples/shquote/prog.c: fix segfault seen on Solaris-10
      (incorrect use of getline(3))

  mk-configure.7:
    * add missing documentation for features "reallocarray", "fparseln"
      and "vis"
    * minor fixes
    * CXXSTD: fix incorrect description

  Exit with error if generated config under ~/.mkcmake is older than
  system mk files.  This situation potentially means that generated
  configs do not contain all required information about compiler.

  System-wide mk file for compiler settings has higher priority
  than files under ~/.mkcmake

  EXPORT_SYMBOLS: empty lines and comments started with '#' are ignored

  mkc_install: do not remove "$dst" before renaming "$dsttmp" to
  "$dst", it is just useless.

  Simplify the target "installdirs".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 6 16:12:40 UTC 2021 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to mk-configure-0.36.0

  Introduce new variables:
    * CFLAGS_<source>, CXXFLAGS_<source> and CPPFLAGS_<source>.
      Now one can add some C/C++ compilation flags on per source file
      basis.
    * CCSTD and CXXSTD.
      Now projects based on mk-configure may require
      standard-compliant compiler, for example, C99.
    * CFLAGS0 and CXXFLAGS0.
    * MKCOMPILERSETTINGS.
      See README.for_packagers file for details

  Internal mk files are included only if it is really necessary.  For
  example, mkc_imp.incs.mk is included only if variable INCS is not
  empty. In theory, this should speed-up mkcmake.

  New features: humanize_number, shquote and pwdgrp.

  Deprecate some things:
    * implicit MAN page, that is when MAN variable is not set,
      but man file exists
    * ~/.mk-c directory and @sysconfdir@/mk-c.conf file.
      Please rename them to ~/.mkcmake and
      @sysconfdir@/mkcmake.conf respectively.

  Add preliminary support for ARMCC compiler.

  Optimize installation of directories, run "install -d" once for all
  created directories.

  mkc.lib.mk: after building libraries ${.CURDIR:T}.done file is
  created.  This file is used later for handling inter-project
  dependencies specified by LIBDEPS variable.

  mk-configure.7: document all variables in alphabetic order.
  I hope this makes navigation in the documentation easier.

  Fixes:
    * tests/failed_requirements: fix failure on freebsd
      (strict printf(1))
    * examples/require_tools/fake: make it a real script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 30 08:25:23 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to mk-configure-0.35.0

  Add the following new features: arc4random, bswap, dprintf, efun,
  errc, fparseln, fts, posix_getopt, raise_default_signals,
  reallocarray, strsep and vis.
  See mk-configure.7 for details.

  Fixes: 
    * mkc_check_decl: fix "prototype" mode. Extraction of function name
      was incorrect.  Add one more regression test for this case in
      tests/os_NetBSD.
    * Avoid multiple repetition of MKC_COMMON_DEFINES in CPPFLAGS
    * Fix target "depend" that failed if SRCS contains full path to
      source code.

  Move -Wreturn-type from CFLAGS.warns.{clang,gcc}.2 to
  CFLAGS.warns.{clang,gcc}.1 and make it an error for C++

  CC_TYPE and CXX_TYPE are correctly set if MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM is set.

  Use .error bmake command for checking MKC_REQD.  Also, move
  appropriate check to mkc_imp.preinit.mk, so it is checked in the
  very beginning.  Documentation and error message are slightly
  updated.

  Rename variable DISTCLEANFILES to CLEANDIRFILES, DISTCLEANFILES is
  considered deprecated.

  Rename variable DISTCLEANDIRS to CLEANDIRDIRS, DISTCLEANDIRS is
  considered deprecated.

  Add support for latest Intel C/C++ compiler.  We have to always add
  -we10006 option to it in order it fail when invalid option is used.

  Adapt some features for using functions implementation from
  libnbcompat and libbsd libraries.

  Use .depend_${.CURDIR:T} instead .depend to support MAKEOBJDIR.

  New tests and examples.

- Update to mk-configure-0.34.2

  Do not pass *all* CFLAGS flags to CXXFLAGS.  This fixes builds
  where, for example, clang is used as a C compile and gcc is used as
  a C++ compiler. Also, MKC_CHECK_* variables update MKC_CPPFLAGS
  instead of MKC_CFLAGS.

  Avoid "install -d /" if there is nothing to install.  This fixes
  some failures on some systems/conditions and improves support for
  foreign install(1) programs, e.g., (UCB install on Solaris)

  Fixes for CFLAGS containing -O2 and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=n

  main.mk: clean-ups for target "cleandir" and "clean"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 12:37:23 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to mk-configure-0.34.1

  Fixes in mk-configure:
    * broken builtins prog_* (broken since 0.29.2)
    * MKC_REQUIRE_BUILTINS also sets BUILTIN.<builtin> variable
      (broken -- always)
    * mk/ also installs mkc_imp.foreign_autotools.mk (broken -- always)
    * mkc_compiler_settings(1): unexpected loading of ../Makefile.inc
      (broken -- 0.34.0)
    * mk-configure.7:
      * clang also supports WARNERR
      * add documentation for MKC_REQUIRE_BUILTINS
      * other minor clean-ups and fixes
    * mkc_imp.foreign_autotools.mk: do not change .OBJDIR!

  Fixes and improvements in tests/, examples/ and build infrastructure:
    * examples/hello_calc2: build failure with gcc-10 (multiple
      definition of `calc_lval'). Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich.
    * examples/hello_autoconf: out-of-tree build failure
    * examples/check_compiler_opts: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * examples/hello_require_tools: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * examples/subprojects/test.mk: better ignore nroff
      warning "cannot adjust line"
    * tests/dltest: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * tests/mkc_check_custom: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * tests/os_OpenBSD: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * tests/os_Linux: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * tests/require_prototype: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * tests/os_NetBSD: run "cleandir" at the end of "test"
    * examples/hello_autoconf: use MKC_REQUIRE_BUILTINS
      instead of MKC_CHECK_BUILTINS
    * main.mk: clean -> clean-examples; cleandir -> cleandir-examples

  Add example/Makefile for running tests after installing mk-configure

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 19 16:44:23 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Fix MKC_SYSCONFDIR (/usr/etc). Now it is /etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 17 00:51:23 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Use "bmkdep" as a default "build dependencies" tool
  instead of "makedepend".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 13 16:51:23 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to 0.34.0:

  This release introduces some incompatibilities with older releases:
    - mkc_install -l is changed
    - Target "distclean" is considered deprecated.
      Use target "configure" instead!
    - Remove support for Pascal, Fortran and ObjC.
      Only C and C++ are supported.
    - Do not add ${LEXLIB} to LDADD if SRCS contains .l files.
      You have to add it manually when needed or use new feature "libl".
    - mkc_check_custom: remove options -p and -n
    - LDREAL is either C or C++ compiler, not the linker
    - mkc_check_custom: do not use CARGS anymore
    - Introduce CXXOPTS and CXXOPTS_<prj> variables and
      do not pass COPTS to C++ compiler. COPTS is only for C!

  mk-configure build system changes:
    - Introduce new targets "help", "help_subprj" and "help_use" and
      appropriate framework for documenting the software project.  See
      mkc_imp.help.mk makefile. mk-configure itself uses this
      framework, so, you can run "bmake help" before build. Also
      introduce the following configuring variables for mk-configure:
      USE_AWK, USE_ID, USE_INSTALL, USE_NM, USE_SH, USE_CC_COMPILERS,
      USE_CXX_COMPILERS. See updated doc/INSTALL.md
    - Add virtual targets "examples" in addition to "tests".
    - Move helpers/* scripts to examples/helpers/ subdirectory. They
      are for testing mk-configure only.

  Mk files:
    * C{,XX}FLAGS.{warns,ssp,pie,pic}, LDFLAGS.pie etc...:
      Defaults for these values are determined at build time by
      checking whether compiler/linker accepts the corresponding
      option.  Load compiler specific options from ~/.mk-c and
      MKFILESDIR directories, and exit with error if they do not
      exist. For generating such settings for compiler absent at build
      time, use newly introduced script "mkc_compiler_settings".
    * C{,XX}FLAGS:
      Pass these flags to the compiler after C{,XX}FLAGS.warns
      for overriding bad warnings/errors
    * MKC_CHECK_{CC,CXX}_OPTS:
      double underline symbols in the option is considered
      as a single space
    * MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM:
      - pass MKC_CUSTOM_{CPPFLAGS,CFLAGS,CXXFLAGS,LDFLAGS,LDADD}.<check_name>
        flags to the compiler
      - introduce variable MKC_CUSTOM_NOAUTO.<checkname>
      - introduce variable MKC_CUSTOM_CACHE.<checkname>
      - introduce variable MKC_CHECK_CCLD_OPTS and MKC_CHECK_CXXLD_OPTS
    * Introduce new variables CC_VERSION and CXX_VERSION determined
      by mkc_check_compiler(1)
    * Introduce INSTALL_FLAGS variables and remove undocumented
      COPY, PRESERVE, INSTPRIV and RENAME
    * Keep initial settings for mk-configure in sys.mk
      instead of mkc_imp.vars.mk
    * Introduce MKC_CUSTOM_LINK.<custom_check_name> variable for link testing
    * Introduce CFLAGS.check and CXXFLAGS.check variables
    * Set CFLAGS.dflt.sunpro to -errtags
    * mkc.conf.mk: undefine MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS, MKC_CHECK_CXX_OPTS after use
    * Introduce new checks MKC_CHECK_CCLD_OPTS and MKC_CHECK_CXXLD_OPTS
    * Introduce new "help" framework, see mkc_imp.help.mk section in man page
    * mkc.minitest.mk: minor fix in target "cleandir"

  Features:
    - add support for C++ (extern "C") to all feature header files
    - add new feature "libl" for libl.a or libfl.a

  Utilities:
    * mkc_install:
      - "move" semantic is disabled forever, so flag -c is silently ignored
      - add manual page
      - flag -l is changed and becomes compatible with NetBSD install(1)
      - actually it is almost completely reimplemented
    * mkc_check_compiler:
      - add man page
      - exit status is 2, if bad option is specified
      - CC defaults to "cc" as the documentation says
      - detects not only compiler type, but also a version
      - cache file name for C compiler type is _mkc_cc_type.*
    * mkc_check_custom:
      - switch to getopts
      - add option -l and support for LDFLAGS and LDADD
      - add new option -t and remove options -p and -n
      - do not use CARGS anymore, use CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS instead
    * mkc_which:
      - add man page
    * mkc_check_version:
      - add man page
    * mkc_get_deps:
      - installed to libexec/ instead of bin/

  Documentation update

  Code clean-ups and minor fixes

- Update to 0.33.1:

  Clarify problems with MAKE_VERSION variable.

  mkc_imp.foreign_autotools.mk: fix for incorrect make invocation for
  generated Makefile.

  Remove -Wabi from GNU c++ warnings.

  mkc_check_decl: use autodetected AWK.

- Update to 0.33.0:

  Add new features "getdelin" and "strndup".

  Fix MKC_CHECK_FUNCS<n> when MKC_FUNC_OR_DEFINE.<x> is "yes".

  Fix awk in mkc_check_compiler. AWK is supposed to be replaced as
  seen in Makefile.inc.  This makes awk work correctly on solaris etc.
  Thanks to Niclas Rosenvik!

  Change the order of options passed to the C and C++ compiler.  It
  is: CPPFLAGS0, CPPFLAGS, CPPFLAGS_<project>, C{,XX}FLAGS,
  C{,XX}FLAGS.ssp, C{,XX}FLAGS.pie, C{,XX}FLAGS.warns,
  C{,XX}FLAGS_<project>, C{,XX}FLAGS.pic (for shared objects), COPTS,
  COPTS_<project>.

  scripts/mkc_check_custom: switch to /usr/xpg4/bin/sh on SunOS-5.10

  Fixes in regression tests for Solaris 10 and 11.

  examples/hello_libdeps: fix regression test on
  Linux/mips64/eglibc-2.13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 23:36:18 UTC 2020 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to 0.32.1:

  Changes between 0.32.0 and 0.32.1:

  * Fix MKC_CHECK_SIZEOF when having slashes in the header part.
    Thanks to Niclas Rosenvik for the fix!

  * Fix support for .cxx c++ files in profiled and shared libraries.
    Thanks to Niclas Rosenvik for the fix!

  * Fix in presentation/Makefile

  * Fix in mk-configure.7 man page

  * Fix at_do_* target

  * Remove $(COPTS) from $(CFLAGS) and change COMPILE.{c,cc}

  * Fix regression test examples/hello_errwarn on musl-based Linuxes (Alpine Linux)

  Changes from 0.31.0 and 0.32.0
  
  * Calculate WARNERR and {CC,CXX}FLAGS.warnerr lazily.  This makes some
    interesting scenaria possible, for example, setting WARNS in
    Makefile.common or Makefile.inc top-level files.

  * Feature "prog_gmake": fix fork-bomb seen on FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE-p3
    due to features of native make(1).

  * Fixes for builtins prog_gm4, prog_gmake, prog_gawk and prog_flex
    (multiline output)

  * MKC_BUILTINS_*: fix find_n_match function in mkc_check_common.sh

  * Minor fixes in examples/hello_{yaxx,calc2}

  * Always apply -Werror=implicit-function-declaration for clang.
    This fixes MKC_CHECK_FUNCS on clang-5.0.1 and earlier versions.

  * mkc_imp.foreign_autotools.mk: if AT_MAKE is empty set it to "false"

  * Get rid of builtin "endianess" (with single N)

  * mkc_check_common.sh: always use mkc_which(1) instead of which(1)

  * Updates for Lua code in examples/

  * BMAKE_REQD check: workaround for broken bmake (seen on Darwin) that
    defines empty MAKE_VERSION

  * examples/hello_dictd/test.mk: avoid double-slash in dirs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 11 15:32:46 UTC 2019 - vle@gmx.net

- Update to 0.31.0:

  * Fix in MKC_CHECK_PROTOTYPES.  The problem was it says "found" for
    undeclared prototypes.

  * All FEATURES now check for _MKC_CHECK_<xxx> define.  A check for
    this define guarantees that #include <mkc_XXX.h> are not used
    without appropriate MKC_FEATURES += <xxx> in Makefile.

  * New publicly available mkc.conf.mk header was introduced.  With a
    help of it one can implement custom "FEATURES".

  * MKC_CHECK_HEADERS, MKC_CHECK_HEADER_FILES, MKC_CHECK_DEFINES,
    MKC_CHECK_TYPES, MKC_CHECK_VARS, MKC_CHECK_MEMBERS,
    MKC_CHECK_FUNCS<n>, MKC_CHECK_PROTOTYPES, MKC_CHECK_SIZEOF and
    MKC_PROTOTYPE_HEADERS.<name> now accepts a list of comma-separated
    headers for checking at once.
    For example, on NetBSD sys/fts.h requires preceding sys/types.h and
    sys/stat.h. So, now we can write
     MKC_CHECK_HEADERS  = sys/types.h,sys/stat.h,fts.h

  * MKC_CHECK_FUNCS<n>: new variable MKC_FUNC_OR_DEFINE.<func> was introduced.
    With a help of it one can check for
    function declaration of equivalent define.

  * mkc_imp.conf-final.mk: duplicated entries are not added to CPPFLAGS,
    CFLAGS, LDADD and SRCS.

  * Man page for mkc_check_decl, mkc_check_sizeof and mkc_check_headers
    were updated.

  * mkc.minitest.mk: new variable MKC_DIFF was introduced for diff(1)
    command.

  * mkc_check_decl: new check type funcordefine was introduced.

  * Improvements and minor fixes in regression tests and examples.

  * This release was sucessfully tested on FreeBSD-11.1, diverse
    glibc-based Linuxes, NetBSD-8.99, OpenBSD-6.4 and SunOS-5.11.

  * Deprecated features were removed: DPLIBS and PKG_CONFIG_DEPS variables,
    builtin "endianess".

  * Variables MKC_{CHECK,REQUIRE}_HEADER_FILES were introduced.
  * Improvements and addons to regression tests.
  * Improvements and minor fixes in

  * This may fix checking failure if -Werror=strict-prototyping
    is passed to CFLAGS.
  * OBJDIR_<project> is now set correctly with MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX.
  * Fix build failure (mkc_check_prog not found).
  * Fix MKC_FEATURES "fgenln".
  * mkc_check_common.sh is installed to libexec directory.
- Let's ignore more tests (mkshlib, mkstaticlib, mkpiclib, mkdll,
  mkprofilelib) & examples (hello_cxx, hello_cxxlib)
  to prevent build-time issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  2 16:03:44 UTC 2014 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- 0.29.0 version:
  * New variables MKC_CHECK_CC_OPTS and MKC_CHECK_CXX_OPTS were
    introduced for checking C/C++ compiler's options;
  * Makefile.inc and Makefile.common are included after
    system variables are set, in particular CC and CXX;
  * CC_TYPE is now set in mk.init.mk;
  * Fixes for "err" and "warn" features.  Now verr(3), verrx(3),
    vwarn(3) and vwarnx(3) functions are detected correctly
    (the problem was seen on gcc-4.9/armv7);
  * Fix support for COMPATLIB.  Objects for "features" should not
    be generated outside compatibility library;
  * A number of fixes in regression tests: support for latest GCC,
    lib64 and lib/tri-ple-ts Linuxes;
  * mkc_check_custom:
    - new option -e for checking stderr for emptyness,
    - new option -b for printing yes/no instead of 1/0,
    - additional options to compiler are passed.
- `bmake cleandir-*` to clean examples dir after %check.
