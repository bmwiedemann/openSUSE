%description
The makedepend program reads each sourcefile in sequence and parses it
like a C-preprocessor so that it can correctly tell which #include
directives would be used in a compilation.

These dependencies are then written to a makefile in such a way that
make will know which object files must be recompiled when a dependency
has changed.
