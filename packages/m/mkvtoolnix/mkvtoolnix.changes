Fri Dec  6 18:55:59 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 41.0.0
  New features and enhancements:
  * mkvmerge: Matroska reader: Vorbis tracks: stream comments
    (aka Vorbis comments) will be converted to Matroska
    attachments (for cover arts) and Matroska track tags (for
    other comments). Additionally the stream comments will be
    removed from Vorbis headers.
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: added support for reading Opus audio
    from MP4 files. Part of the implementation of #2673.
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: added support for reading VP9 video
    from MP4 files. Part of the implementation of #2673.
  * mkvmerge: Ogg reader: Vorbis, Opus & VP8 streams: stream
    comments (aka Vorbis comments) will be converted to Matroska
    attachments (for cover arts) and Matroska track tags (for
    other comments). Additionally the stream comments will be
    removed from Vorbis headers.
  * mkvmerge: WAV reader: added support for reading RF64 files.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the list of predefined track
    names is now split up into three lists, one for each track
    type (audio, video & subtitles). Part of the implementation
    of #2654.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: when trying to add thumbnails
    for a Blu-ray the GUI will determine the thumbnail's pixel
    size from the thumbnail files if the XML file doesn't
    contain that information. This works for JPEG and PNG files.
    Implements #2674.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: general: line edits & combo boxes will now
    have a "clear text" button appear whenever they're not
    empty. Part of the implementation of #2654.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: update check: the dialog showing the latest
    news & version information states explicitly where the links
    take the user (the MKVToolNix `NEWS.md` file and YouTube
    respectively).
    Bug fixes:
  * mkvmerge: Matroska reader: mkvmerge did not copy the codec's
    private data when reading WavPack from Matroska files. Fixes
    #2685.
  * mkvmerge: MPLS handling: re-added caching when using MPLS
    playlists as input files. Fixes #2666.
  * mkvmerge: MPEG TS reader: when reading an MPLS playlist, the
    calculation of the minimum timestamp to use for shifting all
    output timestamps to zero was wrong. It was wrongfully
    considering timestamps from packets it would not copy due to
    the MPLS's timestamp restrictions. This could lead to the
    first timestamps in the output file being quite large, e.g.
    more than a couple of minutes, causing sync problems when
    multiplexing together with other files. Fixes #2670.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the automatic switch between
    aspect ratio & display width/height wasn't reflected in the
    configuration generated for `mkvmerge`. The user had to
    change between the two settings manually. Fixes #2660.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the progress dialog shown when
    scanning a Blu-ray wasn't closed properly in certain
    situations. Fixes #2678.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: general: the configured font was not applied
    to a lot of controls (e.g. the file & track lists or the
    menu entries) on application startup. Instead the user had
    to open & close the preferences in order for the font to be
    applied to all controls. Fixes #2671.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  9 13:38:39 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 40.0.0
  New features and enhancements:
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: added support for BMP covert art
    images.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: added an option to disable
    deriving the destination file name from the file title.
    Implements #2648.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the content of the
    "stereoscopy" combo box has been simplified making the box's
    minimum width much smaller, allowing the user to resize the
    GUI's whole window to a much smaller width.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: whenever the user changes the
    "aspect ratio" or "display dimensions" controls, the
    corresponding radio button will be activated automatically.
    Implements #2651.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: Windows: added a setting in the preferences
    to disable the GUI's dark color mode even if Windows's app
    color mode is set to dark. Implements #2646.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: Windows: replaced the dark mode introduced
    in v39 with another dark mode that's less wasteful with
    space between widgets.
  Bug fixes:
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: mkvmerge was reading eight bytes too
    many for cover art images. This could cause file
    identification to fail when the cover art was located at the
    end of the MP4 file. Even if it succeeded, this meant too
    much data present in the attachment. Fixes #2650.
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: covert art images with unknown image
    types will be skipped instead of treated as JPEG images.
  Build system changes:
  * Qt 5.9.0 or newer is now required for building MKVToolNix
    GUI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  5 08:20:29 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 39.0.0
  New features and enhancements:
  * mkvmerge: Blu-ray: when reading an MPLS playlist mkvmerge
    will look up and use chapter names from the Blu-ray's
    "track/chapter names" meta data if it exists. Part of the
    implementation of 2486.
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: if present, cover art images (the
    `meta.udta.ilist.covr` atom) will be converted into
    attachments.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: when adding a playlist from a
    Blu-ray disc, the disc library meta data will be parsed, and
    the biggest thumbnail, if present, will be added as a new
    attachment with name `cover.jpg` (extension depends on
    thumbnail's extension). Implements #2644.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: when adding a playlist from a
    Blu-ray disc, the title from the disc library meta data will
    be set as the new file title if the disc library meta data
    contains one & no title has been set yet.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the automatically generated
    destination file name will now be based on the file title if
    one is set at that point. This works in conjunction with the
    title being said from the Blu-ray disc library meta data.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: chapter editor: when reading chapters from
    an MPLS playlist the GUI will look up and use chapter names
    from the Blu-ray's "track/chapter names" meta data if it
    exists. Part of the implementation of 2486.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: Windows: added a dark mode that's enabled
    when Windows 10's dark mode is turned on.
  * translations: added a Bulgarian translation of the programs
    & the man pages by Симеон Цветков (see `AUTHORS`).
  Bug fixes:
  * mkvmerge: attachments without a file name won't be ignored
    anymore. Part of the fix of #2642.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: header editor: attachments with an empty
    name element will be shown as `<unnamed>` as originally
    intended. Part of the fix of #2642.
  * Linux AppImage: the AppImage will no longer change
    directories before running the desired executable allow the
    use of relative file names. Fixes #2632.
  Build system changes:
  * MKVToolNix now requires a C++ compiler that supports the
    following features of the C++17 standard: "`[[maybe_unused]]`
    attribute", "nested namespace definition",
    "structured bindings". For the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc)
    this means v7 or newer; for clang it means v4 or newer.
  * Boost 1.60.0 or newer is now required.

- Use system nlohmann-json

- Spec cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  6 13:53:57 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 38.0.0
  New features and enhancements:
  * mkvextract: chapters, tags & cue sheets will now be written
    to standard output if no file name is given, same as if `-`
    is given as the file name.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: job queue: added a new setting in the
    preferences' "job queue & job status" section that, when
    enabled, will cause the GUI to remove all output files
    created by jobs that are either aborted by the user or that
    end in an error. Implements #2614.
  Bug fixes:
  * all programs: macOS: fixed file access if the file name
    (including all path components) contains any Unicode
    character where NFC (Normalization Form Canonical Composed)
    and NFD (Normalization Form Canonical Decomposed) differ,
    e.g. German Umlauts. Fixes #2620.
  * mkvmerge: when splitting by chapters the user can now split
    by chapters coming from one of the appended files, too.
    Fixes #2625.
  * mkvmerge: AAC reader: fixed reading codec parameters
    (channels, sample rate) if a file starts with garbage that
    includes valid-but-bogus AAC headers. Fixes #2622.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: Hebrew was added to the list of often-used
    languages so that it can be selected by default again. Fixes
    #2610.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: when updating the GUI's settings from
    v37.0.0 or older, the GUI checks if the list of often-used
    languages equals the built-in list from v36.0.0. If it does,
    it will be updated to the built-in list changed in v37.0.0.
    Fixes #2611.
  Build system changes:
  * Boost's Operators header library is now required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  2 13:02:43 UTC 2019 - Ismail Dönmez <idonmez@suse.com>

- Update to version 37.0.0
  New features and enchancements:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: the list of often used languages now contains those from
    Wikipedia's "List of languages by native speakers" by default. Also by
    default only those languages will be shown in the language drop-down boxes.
  * mkvmerge: mkvmerge now allows appending AV1, VP8, VP9, H.264/AVC and
    H.265/HEVC tracks whose pixel dimensions differ. Implements #2582.
  Bug fixes:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: fixed a bug in the "make destination file names
    unique" logic that caused an existing number-in-parenthesis at the end of
    the file base name to be removed in certain situations (e.g. when the first
    added file was named `m (3).mkv` and both `m (3) (1).mkv` and `m (3)
    (2).mkv` existed already, the GUI was suddenly use `m.mkv` instead of `m (3)
    (3).mkv`).
  * MKVToolNix GUI: on Windows the GUI is built with a slightly older version of
    the Qt library again (5.12.4). The Qt version used in release v36.0.0,
    v5.13.0, lead to crashes when doing certain things such as selecting
    multiple tracks in the multiplexer. Fixes #2605 and #26008.
  * source code: fixed building with Boost 1.71.0. Fixes #2599.
  * all: fixed the spelling of the H.264 & H.265 codec names.
  * mkvmerge: Blu-ray MPLS handling: mkvmerge will now find corresponding M2TS
    files even if the `clip_codec_identifier` playlist item field is not set to
    `M2TS` in the MPLS file. Fixes #2601.
  * mkvmerge: fixed handling of text files that use both DOS-style and
    Unix-style line endings resulting in problems such as text subtitle files
    not being parsed correctly. Fixes #2594.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 26 13:22:47 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 35.0.0
  New features and enhancements:
  * mkvmerge: JSON identification: the "codec name" track
    property will be output as `codec_name`. The JSON schema has
    been bumped to v12 for this change.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: job queue: added a new type of action to
    execute after job completion: deleting source files for of
    multiplexer jobs. As this is a destructive operation, the
    action is disabled by default. Implements #869 and #2570.
  Bug fixes:
  * mkvmerge: the "codec name" track property wasn't copied from
    Matroska files. Fixes #2566.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: Windows: clearing the
    destination file name will reset the tab name to
    "\<No destination file\>" again. Fixes #2571.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the file types were not
    re-translated if the UI language was changed. Fixes #2572.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  7 09:56:50 UTC 2019 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 34.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: bugfix: all subtitle frames are now treated as key
    frames in order to fix wrong data in source files.
   bugfix: AV1: fixed frame timestamp calculation when reading
    bitstreams that lack timing information from IVF files.
   bugfix: Matroska reader: fixed an infinite loop that could
    happen with large video frames and applied timestamp files
    due to too much data being buffered at the wrong time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 16 09:41:48 UTC 2019 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 33.1.0:
  * Build with stack protection
- Update to version 33.0.0:
  * mkvinfo: bugfix: when using the `--size` option, mkvinfo will
   now report the correctly if an element has an unknown size.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bugfix: info tool: clusters with an unknown
   size will now be read and displayed correctly.
  bugfix: multiplexer: if a destination file names ends with a
   number in parenthesis (e.g. a year such as "(2017)"), that
   number will not be stripped anymore during the process of
   ensuring the destination file name is unique. Only those suffixes
   added automatically in prior attempts to make the file name
   unique will be removed.
- Update to version 32.0.0:
  * mkvinfo: new feature: when sizes are output the size of the
   element's data portion is output in addition to the element's
   total size.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: new feature: info tool: the element's data
   portion is shown as an extra column.
  new feature: multiplexer: added column "Delay" to the track list
   containing the additional delay to apply during multiplexing.
  bugfix: the portable mode wasn't detected correctly when the
   current working directory the GUI was started from wasn't the
   directory the GUI's executable file was located it.
  bugfix: multiplexer: using button to change the current
   destination directory to one of the recently used ones did not
   update the file name according to the "make file name unique"
   setting.
  bugfix: multiplexer: the function "set destination file name from
   selected file's name" will now only change the destination file's
   name but not its path.
  * all: fixed handling of Unicode code points > U+FFFF.
- Update to version 31.0.0:
  * all programs: New Feature: added a new option
   `--abort-on-warnings` that will cause the program to abort after
   it has emitted the first warning, similar to how it aborts after
   the first error.
  * mkvmerge, mkvextract: New Feature: when closing files that were
   opened for writing, cached data will not be flushed to storage
   automatically anymore. A new option was added to both programs
   (`--flush-on-close`) that re-enables flushing for people who are
   affected by data loss.
   The reason is that automatic flushing causes long delays in
   processing queues when the output by mkvmerge/mkvextract isn't
   the final product but just an intermediate result to be
   processed further.
  Bugfix: AVI reader: using DV type 1 AVIs will now result in an
   unsupported file type being reported instead of crashing mkvmerge
  Bugfix: HEVC: the height of interlaced streams will now be set
   correctly to the height of the full frame instead of the height of
   a single interlaced field.
  Bugfix: MP4 reader: edit lists consisting solely of elements that
   mkvmerge doesn't support (such as dwells) are simply ignored.
   Before no data was read for such tracks at all.
  Bugfix: text subtitles: entries with an explicit duration of 0ms
   will now be handled correctly: the 0ms duration will be stored
   in Matroska instead of the difference between the current and
   the following entry.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New Feature: multiplexer: the dialog previewing
   different character sets for text subtitles will now keep the
   position of the displayed text when switching between character
   sets.
  Bugfix: multiplexer, chapter editor: fixed drag & drop handling
   with Qt 5.12.0 and newer.
  Bugfix: multiplexer: the GUI did not clean up temporary files
   created when running `mkvmerge`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 19 10:18:54 UTC 2019 - plater <davejplater@gmail.com>

- Fix Factory build by changing rubygem-rake build requirement to
  rubygem(rake) and adding libboost_system build dependency again,
  fixes boo#1129626

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 14 11:31:04 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Drop libboost_system dependency as it is not needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 12 17:43:06 UTC 2019 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 30.1.0:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bugfix: chapter editor: when opening a
   Matroska/WebM file that doesn't contain chapters and later
   saving chapters back to them, the editor was truncating the file
   down to a couple of KB in size.
- Update to version 30.0.0:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New Feature: multiplexer: a new button was
   added next to the "destination file" controls. Clicking it
   shows a menu with the ten most recently used output
   directories. Selecting one of them will change the destination
   file to the selected directory keeping the file name.
  New Feature: The ten most recently used values for the "relative
   output directory" and "fixed output directory" settings are now
   saved. The corresponding settings have been changed into combo
   boxes allowing quick access to those recent values.
  New Feature: The predefined split sizes and durations can now be
   customized in the preferences.
  New Feature: chapter editor: added an option in the "Chapter
   editor" menu for appending chapters from an existing file to the
   currently open editor tab.
  New Feature: Added an action in the context menu for copying the
   selected entry and all of its children to another open editor tab.
  Bugfix: removing a file added as an "additional part" will no
   longer cause a crash.
  * mkvextract: New Feature: WAV extractor: mkvextract will now
   write W64 files instead of WAV files if the file name extension
   is `.w64` or if the final file size is bigger than 4 GB, the
   file size limit for WAV files.
  * mkvmerge: Bugfix: all files opened for writing will now be
   flushed once before they're closed. This ensures the operating
   system actually writes all cached data to disk preventing data
   loss in certain situations such as power outages or buggy drivers
   in combination with suspending the computer.
  Bugfix: AAC: under certain conditions 8 channel audio files were
   taken for 7 channel ones.
- Update to version 29.0.0:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New Feature: added an option in the preferences
   for disabling automatic scaling for high DPI displays.
  New Feature: The GUI will now prevent the system from going to
   sleep while the job queue is running.
  * mkvmerge: Bugfix: chapter generation: the start timestamps of
   chapters generated in intervals was wrong for files whose
   smallest video timestamp was bigger than 0.
  Bugfix: MP4 reader: fixed handling of atoms whose size exceeds the
   parent atom's size.
  Bugfix: the chapter name template will now also be used when
   reading Ogg-style chapter files with empty chapter names.
  * mkvextract: Bugfix: AAC: mkvextract will now write the program
   config element (PCE) before the first AAC raw data packet if the
   PCE is present in the `AudioSpecificConfig` structure in the
   `Codec Private` Matroska element. The  PCE carries vital
   information about the number of channels and is required in
   certain cases.
  * mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI's header editor: Bugfix: in
   situations when a one-byte space must be covered by a new EBML
   void element the following element must be moved up instead.
   If that moved element is a cluster, the corresponding cue
   entries will now be updated to reflect the cluster's new
   position.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 30 14:07:04 UTC 2018 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 28.2.0
  * mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract, mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI's info
   tool & chapter editor: fixed a case of memory being accessed after
   it had been freed earlier. This can be triggered by specially
   crafted Matroska files and lead to arbitrary code execution. The
   vulnerability was reported as Cisco TALOS 2018-0694 on 2018-10-25
   (CVE-2018-4022). Fixes boo#1113709.
- Update to version 28.1.0
  * mkvmerge: bugfix: AV1 parser: fixed an error in the sequence
   header parser if neither the `reduced_still_picture_header` nor
   the `frame_id_numbers_present_flag` is set.
  bugfix: AV1 parser: when creating the `av1C` structure for the
   Codec Private element the sequence header OBU wasn't copied
   completely: its common data (type field & OBU size among others)
   was missing.
  bugfix: Matroska reader, AV1: mkvmerge will try to re-create the
   `av1C` data stored in Codec Private when reading AV1 from
   Matroska or WebM files created by mkvmerge v28.0.0.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bugfix info tool: the tool will no longer stop
   scanning elements when an EBML Void element is found after the
   first Cluster element.
- Update to version 28.0.0
  * mkvmerge: New feature: AV1 parser: updated the code for the
   finalized AV1 bitstream specification.
  New feature: AV1 packetizer: updated the code for the finalized
   AV1-in-Matroska & WebM mapping specification.
  New feature: AV1 support: the `--engage enable_av1` option has
   been removed again.
  New feature: MP4 reader: added support for AV1.
  New feature: DTS: implemented dialog normalization gain removal
   for extension substreams.
  New feature: VP9: mkvmerge will now create codec private data
   according to the VP9 codec mapping described in the WebM
   specifications.
  bugfix: JSON identification: fixed a bug when removing invalid
   UTF-8 data from strings before they're output as JSON.
  bugfix: MP4/QuickTime reader: fixed handling of PCM audio with
   FourCC `in24`.
  bugfix: MPEG transport stream reader, teletext subtitles: the
   decision whether or not to keep frames around in order to
   potentially merge them with the following frame is made sooner.
   That avoids problems if there are large gaps between teletext
   subtitle frames which could lead to frames being interleaved
   too late.
  * mkvmerge, mkvextract: New feature: simple text subtitles:
   added a workaround for simple text subtitle tracks that don't
   contain a duration.
  * mkvextract: New feature: added support for extracting AV1 to IVF.
  New feature: IVF extractor (AV1, VP8, VP9): precise values will
   be used for the frame rate numerator & denominator header fields
   for certain well-known values of the track's default duration.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New feature: automatic scaling for high DPI
   displays is activated if the GUI is compiled with Qt ≥ 5.6.0.
  New feature: added a menu item ("Help" → "System information") for
   displaying information about the system MKVToolNix is running on
   in order to make debugging easier.
  New feature: multiplexer, header editor: the user can enter a list
   of predefined track names in the preferences. She can later select
   from them in "track name" combo box.
  * mkvextract: bugfix: IVF extractor (AV1, VP8, VP8): the frame rate
   header fields weren't clamped to 16 bits properly causing wrong
   frame rates to be written in certain situations.
  * mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI's header editor: bugfix: fixed file
   corruption when a one-byte space must be covered with a new EBML
   void element but all surrounding elements have a "size length"
   field that's eight bytes long already.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 08:08:54 UTC 2018 - Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de>

- Update to version 27.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: New feature: chapters: the timestamps of chapters
   read from containers or from chapter files can be adjusted
   (multiplication and addition) with the new
   `--chapter-sync` option or using the special track ID `-2`
   for the existing `--sync` option.
  Bugfix: AC-3: dialog normalization gain removal was corrupting
   E-AC-3 frames irreversibly by writing checksums in places where
   they didn't belong. Additionally only the first E-AC-3 frame in
   a Matroska was processed but not additional dependent frames in
   the same block.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New feature: multiplexer: adjusted & added
   controls for mkvmerge's new feature of being able to adjust
   chapter timestamps.
  New feature: multiplexer: the GUI can now ask for confirmation
   when the user is about to create a file that won't contain
   audio tracks. It does this by default if at least one source
   file contains an audio track.
  Bugfix: fixed a leak of Windows font resources leading to a
   general slowdown and subsequent crash.
- Update to version 26.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: New feature: chapter generation: if the name template
   given by `--generate-chapters-name-template` is empty, no names
   will be generated for the chapter atoms.
  New feature: chapters: chapter names generated from MPLS files
   will now use the name template if one is set via
   `--generate-chapters-name-template`.
  New feature: mkvmerge will no longer abort with an error message
   if no audio, video and subtitle tracks should be multiplexed.
   This allows copying of chapters from non-chapter source files.
  Bugfix: Matroska reader: fixed wrong timestamps when appending
   Matroska files where the second Matroska file's first timestamp
   is bigger than 0.
  Bugfix: MP4 reader: fixed division by zero errors during file
   identification if the timescale is 0 in the `MVHD` atom.
  Bugfix: Windows Television DVR files are now recognized as an
   unsupported file type. This prevents mis-detection as MPEG-2
   with an accompanying flood of error messages.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New feature: the font size in the tool
   selector on the left will scale with the font size the
   user selects in the preferences.
  New feature: the GUI will no longer automatically resize the
   columns in tree and list views to match the content size.
   Instead it remembers and restores the widths set by the user.
  New feature: multiplexer: the chapter name template will now be
   set automatically to the name template in the preferences'
   "chapter editor" section. Additionally the option
   `--generate-chapters-name-template …` will be passed to
   mkvmerge in situations when mkvmerge will generate chapters.
  New feature: chapter editor: if the chapter name template is empty,
   chapters will be generated without names.
  New feature: chapter editor: added an option to remove all chapter
   names to the "additional modifications" dialog.
  Bugfix: info tool: under certain circumstances "cues" were shown at
   the wrong level (inside the previous master element instead of on
   lvel 1).
  Bugfix: job queue: fixed invalid memory handling and consequent
   crashes when using the "edit in corresponding tool & remove from
   job queue" option if one of the files in that job contained
   attached files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 22:52:50 UTC 2018 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to 25.0.0:
  * mkvextract: New feature: VobSub extraction: empty SPU packets
    will now be dropped during extraction as other tools such as
    MP4Box cannot handle them correctly.
   Bugfix: fixed a crash when mkvextract with a non-Matroska file as
    the source file.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New feature:: multiplexer: added options to only
    enable tracks of certain types by default.
   New feature: multiplexer: added an option to enable dialog
    normalization gain removal by default for all audio tracks for
    which the operation is supported.
   New feature: multiplexer: when deriving track languages from the
    file names is active and the file name contains the usual
    season/episode pattern, then only the part after the
    season/episode pattern will be used for detecting the language.
   New feature: multiplexer: the regular expression used for deriving
    track languages from the file names can now be customized in
    the preferences.
   New feature: multiplexer: the user can now customize the list of
    track languages the GUI recognizes in file names. This list
    defaults to a handful of common languages instead of the full
    list of supported languages.
   Bugfix: multiplexer: when scanning playlists, all playlists were
    offered for selection regardless of the value of the "minimum
    playlist duration" setting.
   Bugfix: multiplexer: deriving track languages from file names:
    the regular sub-expressions for ISO 639-1 codes could match
    on empty strings, too, causing matches in wrong places and hence
    no language being recognized in certain situations.
   Bugfix: header editor: fixed a crash when saving the file fails
    (e.g. because it isn't writable).
   Bugfix: header editor: the editor was wrongfully claiming that
    mandatory elements with default values cannot be removed in
    the "status" text.
   Bugfix: preferences: on macOS & Linux the setting "enable copying
    tracks by their type" wasn't restored on program start.
   Bugfix: the central area is now scrollable, allowing the GUI to be
    resized to almost arbitrary sizes.
   Bugfix: multiplexer: the "copy file title to destination file name"
    functionality will now replace everything in the destination file
    name up to the last period instead of only up to the first period.
  * mkvmerge: New feature: SRT/ASS/SSA text subtitles: for files for
    which no encoding has been specified, mkvmerge will try UTF-8
    first before falling back to the system's default encoding.
   New feature: SRT/ASS/SSA/WebVTT text subtitles: a warning is now
    emitted if invalid 8-bit characters are encountered outside valid
    multi-byte UTF-8 sequences.
   New Feature: Matroska & MPEG transport stream readers: the encoding
    of text subtitles read from Matroska files can now be changed
    with the '--sub-charset' parameter.
   New feature: MP4 reader: improved the detection of edit lists
    consisting of two identical entries, each spanning the file's
    duration as given in the movie header atom. The second entry is
    ignored in such cases.
   New feature: JSON identification: the "display unit" video track
    property is now reported as `display_unit`. The JSON schema has
    been bumped to v11 for this change.
   New feature: AVC/h.264: empty NALUs will now be removed.
   New feature: input: format detection uses file-extension to improve
    performance and to give preference when several formats match.
   New feature: AV1: added support for reading AV1 video from
    Open Bitstream Unit files.
   New feature: AV1: adjusted the code for the AV1 bitstream format
    changes made up to 2018-05-02 (git revision d14e878).
   New feature: MP4 reader: if a track has an edit list with two
    identical entries, each spanning the file's duration as given in
    the movie header atom, then the second entry will now be ignored.
    Improves the handling of files with bogus data.
   Bugfix: AVC/h.264 and HEVC: fixed file identification failing
    for certain elementary streams due to internal buffers not
    being cleared properly.
   Bugfix: MLP code: fixed various issues preventing MLP from being
    parsed correctly.
   Bugfix: TrueHD/MLP packetizer; dialog volume normalization removal
    isn't attempted if the track is an MLP track as the operation is
    only supported for TrueHD, not MLP.
   Bugfix: MPEG TS reader: when reading MPLS mkvmerge will now
    compare the MPLS's start and end timestamps against the transport
    stream's PTS instead of its DTS. Otherwise the first key frame of
    a video track might be dropped if it isn't the first in
    presentation order.
   Bugfix: JSON identification: mkvmerge will ensure that all strings
    passed to the JSON output modules are valid UTF-8 encoded strings
    by replacing invalid bytes with placeholder characters. This avoids
    the JSON library throwing an exception and mkvmerge
    aborting on such data.
   Bugfix: audio packetizers: mkvmerge will now keep discard
    padding values if they're present for packets read
    from Matroska files.
   Bugfix:  Ogg Opus reader: packet timestamps aren't calculated by
    summing up the duration of all packets starting with
    timestamp 0 anymore. Instead the algorithm is based on the Ogg page's
    granule position and which packet number is currently timestamped
    (special handling for the first and last packets in the stream).
   Bugfix: E-AC-3 parser: fixed determining the number of channels for
    streams that contain an AC-3 core with dependent E-AC-3 frames.
   Bugfix:  Matroska reader: fixed mkvmerge buffering the whole file if a
    video track is multiplexed that consists of only one or a few frames.
   Bugfix: the "display unit" video track property will now be kept if
    it is set in the source file.
   Bugfix:  MP3 packetizer: removed a memory leak growing linearly with the
    track's size.
   Bugfix: VobSub packetizer: whenever a VobSub packet doesn't contain a
    duration on the container level, mkvmerge will now set it from
    the duration in the SPU packets. Before it was accidentally setting
    the SPU-level duration to 0 instead.
   Bugfix:  track statistics tags: if writing the `Date` element is
    deactivated via `--no-date`, the `_STATISTICS_WRITING_DATE_UTC`
    isn't written either anymore.
   Bugfix: removed several small, constant-size memory leaks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  9 07:58:38 UTC 2018 - rpm@fthiessen.de
- Update to 22.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: New feature: AC-3, DTS, TrueHD: added an option for
    removing/minimizing the dialog normalization gain for all
    supported types of the mentioned codecs.
   New feature: AV1: added support for reading AV1 video from IVF,
    WebM and Matroska files.
   New feature: FLAC: mkvmerge can now ignore ID3 tags in FLAC
    files which would otherwise prevent mkvmerge from detecting the
    file type.
   Bugfix: MP4 reader: fixed reading the ESDS audio header atom if
    it is located inside a "wave" atom inside the "stsd" atom.
   Bugfix: MP4 reader: AAC audio tracks signalling eight channels
    in the track headers but only seven in the codec-specific
    configuration will be treated as having eight channels.
   Bugfix: MPEG TS reader: fixed wrong handling of the continuity
    counter for TS packets that signal that TS payload is present
    but where the adaptation field spans the whole TS packet.
   Bugfix: the 'document type version' and 'document type read version'
    header fields are now set depending on which elements are
    actually written, not on which features are active.
   Bugfix: the 'document type version' header field is now set
    to 4 correctly if any of the version 4 Matroska elements
    is written.
  * mkvinfo: New Feature: the size and positions of frames
    within "SimpleBlock" and "BlockGroup" elements are now shown
    the same way they're  shown for other elements.
   Bugfix: summary mode: the file positions reported for frames in
    `BlockGroup` elements did not take the bytes used for
    information such as timestamp, track number flags or lace sizes
    into account. They were therefore too low.
  * mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI header editor: the
    'document type version' and 'document type read version' header
    fields are now updated if elements written by the changes require
    higher version numbers.
   Bugfix: mandatory elements can now be deleted if there's a default
    value for them in the specifications.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: added options for deriving the
    track languages from the file name by searching for
    ISO 639-1/639-2 language codes or language names enclosed in
    non-word, non-space characters.
   Bugfix: info tool: implemented reading all elements in the file
    after the first cluster. Only top-level elements are shown;
    child elements are only loaded on demand.
   Bugfix: info tool: added a context menu with the option to show a
    hex dump of the element with the bytes making up the EBML ID and
    the size portion highlighted in different colors.
    In-depth highlighting is done for the data in `SimpleBlock`
    and `Block` elements.
   Bugfix: chapter editor: added an option to remove all end
    timestamps to the "additional modifications" dialog.
- Update to 21.0.0:
  * mkvinfo: the GUI portion has been removed. mkvinfo is now a pure
     command-line program again.
  * mkvmerge: New feature: track statistics tags: the `TagDefault`
    element will not be written anymore as it was always set to the
    default value `1` anyway.
   New feature: JSON files can now contain C++-style line comments
    outside of strings. Such comments, even though not part of the
    official JSON specifications, are now ignored when reading JSON
    files.
   Bugfix: Appending files with additional parts at the same time
    was broken if more than one additional part was appended.
   Bugfix: FLV reader: a single invalid AAC frame was written for
    AAC audio tracks with codec initialization data longer than five
    bytes.
   Bugfix: FLV reader: timestamps will be normalized down to 0.
   Bugfix: MP4 reader: if an AAC track doesn't contain an
    AAC-specific decoder configuration in the ESDS portion,
    then a default decoder configuration will be generated based on
    the track's header data instead of skipping the track.
   Bugfix: MP4 reader: fixed reading HEVC/h.265 video tracks if
    they're stored as Annex B byte streams inside MP4.
   Bugfix: Ogg Opus reader: mkvmerge will now emit a warning
    instead of aborting when it encounters an Ogg Opus page with
    no data in the packet.
   Bugfix: Matroska parser: fixed a segmentation fault that
    occurred whenever the first level 1 element after resyncing
    after an error in the file structure isn't a cluster.
   Bugfix: fixed a crash during file type detection for
    attachments if MKVToolNix is installed in a path with
    non-ASCII characters (e.g. German Umlauts).
  * MKVToolNix GUI: New Feature: chapter editor: opening a
    Matroska file without chapters in it will now open the file
    in an empty chapter editor instead of showing an error message.
   New Feature: an "info" tool has been added, replacing the
    functionality of mkvinfo's GUI. The functionality is not on
    par yet but will be for release v22.
   Bugfix: MKVToolNix GUI: Bugfix: multiplexer: the subtitle
    character set can now be set for appended subtitle files, too.
   Bugfix: MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: when appending, all tracks
    appended to disabled tracks will start out disabled, too.
  * mkvinfo: the `--hex-positions` parameter did nothing in summary mode.
   Bugfix: mkvinfo: Windows: line endings will be written as `\r\n`
    again instead of just `\n`.
  * mkvpropedit: Bugfix: adding track statistics tags: for tracks
    with content encoding (compression) mkvpropedit is now
    accounting the uncompressed number of bytes, not the encoded
    (compressed) number of bytes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 21 23:21:58 UTC 2018 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to 20.0.0:
  * Feature removal: several deprecated features have been removed:
   mkvmerge: the deprecated options `--identify-verbose`,
    `--identify-for-gui`, `--identify-for-mmg` and
    `--identification-format verbose-text`
   all command line tools: support for the deprecated, old,
    proprietary format used for option files
   all command line tools: support for passing command line
    options via the deprecated environment variables
    `MKVTOOLNIX_OPTIONS`, `MKVEXTRACT_OPTIONS`, `MKVINFO_OPTIONS`,
    `MKVMERGE_OPTIONS` and `MKVPROPEDIT_OPTIONS`
  * mkvmerge: AVC/h.264 packetizer (framed): access unit delimiter
    NALUs will now be removed.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 parser: when fixing the bitstream timing
    information mkvmerge will now use exact representations of
    the desired field duration if possible.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 parser: mkvmerge no longer assumes that
    encountering sequence parameter set or picture parameter set
    NALUs signal the start of a new frame.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 packetizer (framed): when mkvmerge is told
    to fix the bitstream timing information, it will now update
    all SPS NALUs, not just the ones in the AVCC.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: TS packet payloads will only be
    treated as PES packets if the payload actually starts with
    a PES start code. The prior behavior led to wrong timestamps
    and potentially broken frame data.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: mkvmerge will now drop incomplete PES
    packets as soon as an error is detected in the transport
    stream instead of passing the incomplete frame to the
    packetizer. An error is assumed either if the
    `transport_error_indicator` flag is set or if the value of
    the `continuity_counter` header field doesn't match the
    expected value.
   bugfix: Opus: when re-muxing Opus from Matroska mkvmerge will
    now write "block duration" elements for all block groups
    where a "discard padding" is set, too.
   bugfix: SRT reader: mkvmerge can now handle SRT files with
    timestamps without decimal places.
   bugfix: read buffer I/O class: the class could get out of sync
    regarding the file position of the underlying file I/O class
    causing wrong data to be returned on subsequent read
    operations. One result was that trying to identifying MPLS
    files that refer to very short M2TS files caused mkvmerge
    to segfault.
   bugfix: multiplexer core: if there's a gap in audio timestamps,
    a new block group/lace will be started for the first frame
    after each gap. Before the fix the frame after the gap was
    often stored in the previous block group causing the gap to
    be in the wrong place: at the end of that block group.
  * mkvextract: bugfix: AVC/h.264: if two consecutive IDR frames
    with the same `idr_pic_id` parameter and no access unit
    delimiters are found between them, mkvextract will insert an
    access unit delimiter in order to signal the start of a new
    access unit.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bugfix: update check dialog: Markdown links will
    now be converted to clickable links.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 25 18:43:33 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 19.0.0
  * mkvmerge: splitting by duration, by timestamps or by
    timestamp-based parts: mkvmerge will now consider the first
    key frame within 1ms of the requested value to be eligible
    for splitting.
  * mkvmerge: fixed reading text files encoded in UTF-16 order
    UTF-32 that have different forms of line endings (new lines,
    carriage returns or a mix of both).
  * MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: once a "subtitle/chapter
    character set" was set for a track it couldn't be changed
    back to the empty entry (= auto-detection) anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 12 15:11:02 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

-Update to 18.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: bugfix: AAC ADTS parser: fixed interpretation of the
    `channel_configuration` header element for ADTS files that do
    not contain a program configuration element: value 7 means
    7.1 channels.
   bugfix: Matroska identification: the `date_local` and
    `date_utc` attributes will only be output if the identified
    Matroska file actually contains the "date" header field.
   bugfix: WebVTT: mkvmerge did not recognize timestamp lines if
    the hours components were absent.
   enhancement: AVC & HEVC ES parsers: performance improvements
    by copying much less memory around.
   enhancement: tags: reintroduced a workaround for non-compliant
    files with tags that do not contain the mandatory `SimpleTag`
    element. This workaround was removed during code refactoring
    in release v15.0.0.
  * mkvpropedit: bugfix: GUI's header editor: the `date` header
    field won't be added automatically anymore whenever the
    segment info section is edited and the `date` element is
    either deleted or not present in the first place.
  * GUI: multiplexer: the "AAC is SBR/HE-AAC/AAC+" checkbox in
    the "audio properties" section will be disabled if the
    functionality is not implemented for the selected track's
    codec & container.
   enhancement: multiplexer: the "reduce to core" checkbox in
    the "audio properties" section will be disabled if the
    functionality is not implemented for the selected track's
    codec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  8 13:50:41 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to 17.0.0:
  * The word "timecode" has been changed to "timestamp" everywhere.
   This affects program output (including mkvinfo's), GUI controls,
   command line parameters (e.g. `mkvmerge --timestamp-scale …`) and
   file formats.
   All programs remain backwards compatible insofar as they still
   accept "timecode" in all those places.
  * mkvextract's command line interface has been changed to allow
   extraction of multiple items at the same time.
  * mkvmerge: New feature: AC-3: during identification regular AC-3
    and E-AC-3 tracks will now be identified differently for most
    container formats (exception: AVI, Real Media, Ogg/OGM).
    The codec will be reported as `AC-3` for regular AC-3 and as
    `E-AC-3` for E-AC-3 tracks instead of the combined `AC-3/E-AC-3`.
   bugfix: AAC ADTS parser: mkvmerge will now parse the
    `program_config_element` if it is located at the start of an AAC
    frame in order to determine the actual number of channels.
    This overrides invalid channel configurations in the ADTS headers.
   bugfix: fixed AC-3 being misdetected as encrypted MPEG program
    streams under certain conditions.
   bugfix: Dirac: under certain conditions (e.g. only muxing a single
    Dirac track without any other tracks) mkvmerge was always setting
    the pixel width & height to 123. The frame rate was wrong, too.
   bugfix: E-AC-3 in Matroska: if AC-3 cores and their corresponding
    E-AC-3 extension are located in two different Matroska blocks,
    then mkvmerge will now re-assemble them into a single block and
    only use the first block's timestamp.
   bugfix: SRT reader: fixed calculating the duration of entries
    starting with at a negative timestamp.
   bugfix: VC-1: under certain conditions (e.g. only muxing a single
    VC-1 track without any other tracks) mkvmerge was always setting
    the pixel width & height to 123. The frame rate was wrong, too.
   bugfix: command line options: an error message will be output if
    the single-value-form of the `--sync` option is used and it
    isn't a number (e.g. `--sync 0:asd`).
  * mkvpropedit, GUI's header editor: bugfix: both programs will now
    show proper error messages instead of crashing when certain
    kinds of data corruption is found when reading a file.
- Update to 16.0.0:
  * mkvmerge: New feature MP4 reader: added support for Vorbis.
   bugfix: AAC reader: mkvmerge will now emit an error message for
    AAC files whose header fields imply a sampling frequency
    or number of channels of 0.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 ES parser: fixed the calculation of reference
    information for P and B frames. This also fixes some P frames
    being marked as B frames and vice versa.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 ES parser: only non-key frames that have the
    NALU header field `nal_ref_idc` set to 0 will be marked as
    "discardable" in `SimpleBlock` elements. Other half of the
    fix for #2047.
   bugfix: HEVC/h.265: the generation of the HEVCC structure
    stored in `CodecPrivate` was wrong in two places:
    1. the position of the number of sub-layers was swapped with
    reserved bits and 2. the VPS/SPS/PPS/SEI lists did not start
    with a reserved 1 bit.
   bugfix: output: the `doc type version` will be set at least
    to 2 if certain elements are written (`CodecState`,
    `CueCodecState`, `FlagInterlaced`).
   bugfix: output: the track header attributes `MinCache` and
    `MaxCache` will not be written anymore.
   bugfix: Matroska reader: the "key" and "discardable" flags of
    SimpleBlock elements will be kept as they are.
   bugfix: Matroska reader: if present in the file,
    the "white colour coordinate x" track header attribute was
    written to both "white colour coordinate x" and
    "white colour coordinate y" in the output file.
   bugfix: Opus output: mkvmerge will now put all frames with
    discard padding into their own block group.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: Bugfix: header editor: removed the check for
    external modification when saving the file.
   bugfix: job queue: fixed calculation of total progress when
    automatic removal of completed is enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 31 19:10:10 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to 15.0.0:
  * Requires libebml >= 1.3.5
  * Dropped disable-update-check.patch (upstream now provides
    configure option for disabling the update check).
  * mkvmerge, mkvpropedit, GUI's header and chapter editors: the
    programs will no longer add most missing Matroska elements that
    are mandatory but have a default value in the Matroska
    specification (e.g. the `TagLanguage` element with a value of
    `und` if it isn't present in its `SimpleTag` parent).
  * mkvmerge: the option `--colour-matrix` has been renamed to
    `--colour-matrix-coefficients` in order to match the
    specification more closely. The old option name will
    continue to be recognized as well.
  * all: bugfix: selecting the program's language (e.g. via the
    `--ui-language`command-line option or via the GUI's
    preferences) did not work on Linux & Unix if the `LANGUAGE`
    environment variable was set and didn't include the desired
    language. 
  * MKVToolNix GUI: new feature: multiplex tool: added a new entry
    to the "source files" context menu labeled "Set destination
    file name from selected file's name". It will force the GUI
    to consider the selected file to be the reference for
    automatically setting the file name, no matter which file was
    originally added as the first file. It will also force setting
    the destination file name once if automatic destination file
    name generation is turned off in the preferences.
   new feature: multiplex tool: added an option in the preferences
    on "Multiplexer" → "Output" labeled "Only use the first source
    file that contains a video track". If enabled, only source
    files containing video tracks will be used for setting the
    destination file name. Other files that are added are ignore.
   new feature: header editor: added support for editing the video
    colour attributes.
   new feature: header editor: added support for the "video
    projection" track header attributes.
   new feature: job queue: selected jobs can now be move up and
    down by pressing the `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down` keys.
    Additionally, push buttons to move them up & down are shown
    if the corresponding option is enabled in the preferences.
   bugfix: removed the keyboard shortcuts for switching between
    the different tools (e.g. `Ctrl+Alt+1` for the multiplexer).
    They overlapped with basic functionality on keyboards that
    use an `AltGr` key, e.g. German ones, where `AltGr+7` emits
    `{`. As `AltGr+key` is implemented as `Ctrl+Alt+key` under the
    hood, this means that `AltGr+7` is really `Ctrl+Alt+7` which
    the GUI now took to mean "switch to the job queue" instead of
    "insert `{`".
   bugfix: header editor: after saving the file the GUI wasn't
    updating its internal file modification timestamp. That lead
    to the GUI wrongfully claiming that the file had been
    modified externally when the user wanted to save the file
    once more, requiring a reload of the file losing all
    modifications made since saving the first time.
  * mkvmerge: new feature: added support for the
    "video projection" track header attributes.
   bugfix: DTS handling: some source files provide timestamps for
    audio tracks only once every `n` audio frames.
    In such situations mkvmerge was buffering too much data
    resulting in a single gap in the timestamps of one frame
    duration after frame number `n - 1` (the second audio
    timestamp read from the source file was used one output
    frame too early).
  * mkvinfo: new feature: added support for the
    "video projection" track header attributes.
   bugfix: fixed a null pointer dereference if an `EbmlBinary`
    element's data pointer is a null pointer.
  * mkvpropedit: new feature: added support for editing the
    video colour attributes.
   new feature: added support for the "video projection"
    track header attributes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 25 10:17:55 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Split boost-devel BuildRequires for Tumbleweed
- Update to version 14.0.0
  * mkvmerge, mkvpropedit, MKVToolNix GUI (chapter editor):
   new feature: added support for chapters in WebM files that is
    spec-compliant by removing all tag elements not supported
    by the WebM spec.
  * translations: added a Romanian translation of the programs.
  * mkvmerge: bugfix: AVC/h.264 and HEVC/h.265 parser: fixed wrong
    frame order & timestamp calculation in certain situations when
    SPS (sequence parameter sets) or PPS (picture parameter sets)
    change mid-stream.
   bugfix: MPEG-1/-2 video: the "remove stuffing bytes" feature
    introduced in v5.8.0 was broken. In a lot of situations it
    did not detect the end of a slice correctly and removed 0 bytes
    that were actually part of the slice structure. Often there
    were no visual problems as decoders were able to ignore such
    errors, but in other cases there are visual artifacts upon
    decoding. As detecting the slice end properly requires parsing
    the whole slice structure, this feature has been removed again.
   bugfix: MPEG PS reader: fixed mkvmerge trying to handle an "end"
    code the same way as a "program stream map" code.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: mkvmerge won't emit warnings if the
    system's `iconv` library doesn't support the ISO 6937
    character set.
   bugfix: when appending fails the error message details (e.g.
    "the number of channels differs: 1 and 2") were often not output.
   new feature: AAC: implemented support for AAC with 960 samples per
    frame.
   new feature: identification: if the encoding/character set of a
    text subtitle track is known (e.g. because a byte order mark is
    present in the file), then it will be output during
    identification as the `encoding` property.
   new feature: WAV reader: added support for Wave64 files.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bugfix: multiplex tool: implemented a workaround
    for a crash that could occur during drag & drop if at least one
    of the columns is hidden.
   bugifx: multiplex tool: appended tracks can no longer be enabled
    (selected for multiplexing) if the track they're going to be
    appended to is not enabled.
   bugifx: multiplex tool: if the GUI is set to ensure unique output
    file names, it will now verify that right before starting to
    multiplex/adding the job to the queue, too.
   bugifx: fixed the total progress reverting to 0% instead of
    staying at 100% when all jobs have finished. This was introduced
    by the attempt at fixing the computation of the value of total
    progress bar for multiple jobs running.
   new feature: multiplexer: if the encoding/character set of a
    subtitle track cannot be changed, the GUI will deactivate the
    "subtitle character set" drop-down box and ignore changes to it
    when multiple tracks are selected. Additionally, if the track's
    encoding is known and cannot be changed (e.g. due to a
    byte order mark in the file), that encoding will be selected in
    the drop-down box automatically. Both changes signal to the user
    that she doesn't have to take care of the encoding herself.
   new feature: chapter editor: added a function to the "additional
    modifications" dialog for calculating and setting the end
    timestamps.
   new feature: changed the shortcuts for switching between the
    various tools from `Alt+number` (e.g. `Alt+1` for the multiplexer
    tool) to `Ctrl+Alt+number` in order to avoid clashing with
    Windows' input method for arbitrary characters (pressing and
    holding `Alt` and typing the codepoint on the number pad).
   new feature: added a "Window" menu and entries with shortcuts for
    selecting the next (`Ctrl+F6`) respectively previous tab
    (`Ctrl+Shift+F6`) in the current tool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 14:48:50 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to version 13.0.0
  * mkvmerge: new feature: MPEG TS reader: information about
    multiple programs will be output as container properties during
    verbose/JSON identification.
   bugfix: MP4 reader: MPEG-1/2 video read from MP4 files was written
    with an invalid codec ID (e.g. `V_MPEG7`) in certain cases.
   bugfix: MPEG PS reader: made the file type detection less strict
    so that garbage at the start of the file doesn't prevent detection.
   bugfix: MPEG PS reader: (E-)AC-3 tracks were not detected if the very
    first packet for that track didn't contain a full (E-)AC-3 frame.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: fixed mkvmerge not detecting all tracks in
    MPEG transport streams containing multiple programs.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: fixed track content being broken for some
    tracks read from MPEG transport streams containing multiple programs.
   bugfix: JSON identification: the `stream_id` and `sub_stream_id`
    track properties were output as hexadecimal strings instead
    of unsigned integers. As the `ts_pid` track property was only
    used for MPEG transport streams, its value is now output as
    `stream_id` instead, and the `ts_pid` property has been removed.
    The JSON schema version has been bumped to 8 due to this change.
   bugfix: fixed a crash when appending video tracks where one track
    has a CodecPrivate member and the other one doesn't.
   bugfix: track statistics tags: the `NUMBER_OF_BYTES` tag
    is supposed to contain the number of bytes in a track before any
    of the content encoding schemes such as lossless compression
    is applied; however, mkvmerge was wrongfully using the number of
    bytes after the schemes had been applied.
   bugfix: CLPI & MPLS parsers: MPLS and CLPI files with version
    number `0300` as used on Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs are
    now accepted as well.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: new feature: multiplex tool: added a column
    "program" to the tracks list. Certain container types such
    as MPEG transport streams can contain multiple programs.
    The new column will contain the service name (think TV station
    names such as "arte HD") for such streams.
   bugfix: fixed computation of value of total progress bar for
    multiple jobs running.
   bugfix: multiplexer, adding new attachments: when the GUI checks
    if there's an attachment with the same name it will now
    disregard disabled attached files.
   new feature: multiplex tool: the dialog asking the user what to
    do with dropped files (add to current settings, add to new
    settings etc.) now remembers the previous decision and defaults
    to it the next time it's shown.
   new feature: tabs can now be closed by pressing the middle mouse
    button.
  * mkvpropedit: bugfix: fixed a crash when the selector used
    for `--tags` is invalid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  6 17:34:10 UTC 2017 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Adjust usage of gccN-c++ for Leap42 and SLE12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 30 14:10:55 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to version 12.0.0
  * MKVToolNix GUI: new feature: the key combination
    Ctrl+Shift+Space will now toggle the selection of the current
    item in all tree views where multiple selections are allowed.
   new feature: chapter editor: added the extension `*.cue`
    to the "open chapter file" dialog.
   bugfix:preferences → job actions, type "play audio file":
    the GUI will no longer clear the audio file name input if the
    user aborts the audio file selection dialog.
   bugfix: multiplexer tool: the "show command line" dialog will no
    longer include the mkvmerge executable's location as the first
    argument for the two "MKVToolNix option files" escape modes.
   bugfix: header editor: empty track language elements are now
    treated the same as those set to invalid ISO 639-2 codes:
    as if they were set to `und` = "undetermined".
   new feature: watch jobs: the user can now have the GUI execute
    an action once as soon as the current job or the whole queue
    finishes. The actions are the same ones that can be configured
    to be run automatically after job or queue completion.
   new feature: implemented several built-in actions that can be
    executed either on special events or once via the "watch jobs"
    tool. These are: playing an audio file; hibernating, sleeping
    and shutting down the computer.
   new feature: multiplex tool: added a new option for what to do
    after starting to multiplex/adding to the job queue:
    "close current settings" will close the current multiplex
    settings without opening new ones.
  * mkvmerge: New feature: cue sheet parser: if the cue sheet
    contains a non-empty `TITLE` entry and if no other segment title
    has been set yet, then the segment title will be set to the
    cue sheet's `TITLE` value.
   new feature: added an option `--no-date` that prevents the "date"
    field from being written to the segment information headers.
   new feature: FLAC reader: added support for handling embedded
    pictures as attachments.
   new feature: MP4 reader: Added support for parsing the "COLR"
    atom and including its values as track headers.
   bugfix: HEVC/h.265 parser: fixed the superfluous copying of the
    'bitstream_restriction_flag' and its dependent flags in the
    VUI parameters of the sequence parameter sets if the timing
    information is present, too.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader, AAC parser: the MPEG TS reader will now
    force the AAC parser to use the multiplex mode that the MPEG TS
    reader has detected. This prevents the AAC packetizer from
    mis-detecting it in its own attempt to identify the mode.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: valid MPEG transport streams that start
    with an h.264/h.265 start code were not recognized as a
    supported file type.
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: fixed a potential read access from
    invalid memory addresses in the code parsing the program
    map table (PMT).
   bugfix: MPEG TS reader: if packets are encountered that belong
    to a PID not listed in the program map table (PMT), mkvmerge
    will attempt to determine their type and codec from the content.
    This supported content types are AAC (ADTS only) and AC-3.
   bugfix: MP4 reader: fixed finding and parsing the `colr` atom if
    there are more than one video extension atoms and the `colr` atom
    is not the first one.
   bugfix: MP4 reader: the `nclx` colour type of the `colr` atom is
    now recognized, too.
   bugfix: AAC parser: fixed mis-detection of certain data as valid
    ADTS AAC headers resulting in memory allocation failures.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 parser: mkvmerge will now ignore bogus timing
    information in the sequence parameter sets.
   bugfix: AVC/h.264 & HEVC/h.265 parsers: all trailing zero bytes
    will now be removed from NALUs.
   bugfix: HEVC/h.265 parser: fixed copying the
    `bitstream_restriction_flag` and all dependent fields in the VUI
    parameters of the sequence parameter sets.
   bugfix: HEVC/h.265 parser: fixed the calculation of the number of
    parameter set arrays in the HEVCC data structure stored in
    CodecPrivate.
  * mkvpropedit: bugfix: header editor: added support for editing the
    "date" segment information field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 28 21:07:32 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 10.0.0
  * mkvmerge: new feature AVC/h.264 and HEVC/h.265 parser: mkvmerge
    will now drop all frames before the first key frame as they
    cannot be decoded properly anyway.
   new feature HEVC/h.265 parser: added a workaround for invalid
    values for the "default display window" in the VUI parameters
    of sequence parameter sets.
   bugfix MP4 reader: fixed track offsets being wrong in certain
    situations regarding the presence or absence of edit lists
    ('elst' atoms) & composition timestamps ('ctts' atoms).
   bugfix MP4 reader: offsets in "ctts" are now always treated
    as signed integers, even with version 0 atoms.
   bugfix Matroska reader: fixed handling BlockGroups and
    SimpleBlocks with negative timestamps.
   bugfix MP3 packetizer: the MP3 packetizer will no longer drop
    timestamps from source containers if they go backwards.
    This keeps A/V in sync for files where the source was in sync
    even though their timestamps aren't monotonic increasing.
   bugfix AVC/h.264 parser: mkvmerge will now drop timestamps
    from the source container if no frame is emitted for that
    timestamp.
   bugfix HEVC/h.265 parser: mkvmerge will now drop timestamps
    from the source container if no frame is emitted for that
    timestamp.
  * mkvinfo: the timestamps of SimpleBlocks with negative
   timestamps are now shown correctly.
  * mkvextract: SSA/ASS: fixed extraction when the "Format"
   line in the "[Events]" section contains less fields than the
   default for SSA/ASS would indicate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 20 14:43:20 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 9.9.0
  * mkvmerge: AC-3 handling: some source files provide timestamps
    for audio tracks only once every n audio frames. In such
    situations mkvmerge was buffering too much data resulting in
    a single gap in the timestamps of one frame duration after frame
    number n - 1 (the second audio timestamp read from the source
    file was used one output frame too early).
   bugfix MP4 reader: mkvmerge was only reading a small part of MP4
    DASH files where the first "moov" "mdat" atoms occur before the
    first "moof" atom.
   bugfix MP4 reader: edit list ("edts" atoms) that are part of the
    "moof" atoms used in MP4 DASH files weren't parsed. Instead the
    edit lists from the main track headers inside the "moov" atom
    were used.
   bugfix MP4 reader: when an MP4 DASH file contained both normal
    chunk offset table in their regular "moov" atoms, a
    sample-to-chunk table ("stsc" atom) whose last entry had a
    "samples per chunk" count greater than 1 and DASH "trun" atoms,
    then mkvmerge was calculating wrong positions the frame content.
   bugfix MP4 reader: mkvmerge couldn't deal with the key frame index
    table having duplicate entries. The result was that only key
    frames up to and including the first duplicate entry were marked
    as key frames in the output file. All other frames weren't, even
    though some of them were referenced from the key frame table
    after the first duplicate entry.
   bufix MP4 reader: when an MP4 file contained more than one copy of
    the "moov" atom (the track headers etc.), mkvmerge was parsing
    them all adding tracks multiple times.
   bugfix MP4 reader: fixed an integer overflow during the timestamp
    calculation leading to files with wrong timestamps. Such files
    could not be played back properly by most players.
   bugfix MPEG TS reader: if the PMT lists a DVBSUB track, mkvmerge
    will now recognize it without having to find a packet for it
    within the probed range.
   bugfix splitting by parts (both the "timestamps" and the "frames"
    variants): fixed the calculation of track statistics tags. When
    calculating the duration the skipped portions weren't taken into
    account leading to a too-high duration. As a consequence the BPS
    tag (bits per second) was wrong, too.
   bugfix reading files with DVB/HDMV TextSV subtitle tracks with
    invalid CodecPrivate caused mkvmerge to abort with an error
    from boost::format about the format string not having enough
    arguments.
   bugfix: fixed misdetection of certain AC-3 files as MP3 files
    which led to an error message that
    "the demultiplexer could not be initialized".
   bugfix: fixed huge memory consumption when appending big Matroska
    files with sparse tracks (e.g. forced subtitle tracks).
    The Matroska reader will now queue at most 128 MB of data.
   bugfix MP4 reader: the timestamps of all multiplexed tracks will
    now be 0-based properly.
   bugfix MP4 reader: the DTS-to-PTS offsets given by the "ctts"
    atoms are now applied for all tracks containing a "ctts" atom,
    not just h.264 & h.265 tracks.
  * Some new features and enhancements
- Now required for man pages:
  libxslt-tools, docbook-xsl-stylesheets  and po4a

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 14:54:40 UTC 2017 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 9.8.0
  * mkvmerge: MP4 reader: when an MP4 file contained fewer entries
   for timestamps than frames (which they never should), mkvmerge
   would use 0 as the timestamp for all the other frames. This
   resulted in effects such as the last frame of an output file
   having a timestamp of 0 and in split files having a much longer
   duration than they should have. Fixes #1847.
  bug fix: the MPEG transport stream reader was using an outdated
   format for the "CodecPrivate" element for HDMV TextST subtitles.
   This has been updated to the current format which only contains
   the "dialog style element". Existing Matroska files using this
   outdated scheme can be fixed by running them through mkvmerge.
  bug fix: files smaller than 4 bytes were wrongly identified as
   MPEG transport streams.
  bug fix: if a codec delay is set for a track in the input file,
   it is kept. Fixes #1849. bug fix: fixed that the error message
   "not enough space on disk" was shown twice on some operating systems.
  teletext subtitle bug fix: fixed the handling of DVB teletext subtitles
   signaled with data unit ID 0x02 and that contain pages from multiple magazines.
  bug fix: when using --track-order without specifying all tracks,
   the track numbers could end up in a way the user did not expect.
   Now mkvmerge will always assign track numbers for those tracks
   that are listed in --track-order first. The other tracks are
   assigned numbers afterwards. Fixes the second part of #1832.
  bug fix: when reading Matroska files the movie title was always
   taken from the first Matroska source file, even if that file
   didn't have a title set. Fixes one part of #1832.
  MP4: fixed detection of MP3 audio when the object type ID in the
   ESDS signals MP2 and the track headers have invalid values for
   number of channels or sampling frequency. Fixes #1844.
  The command line option "--check-for-updates" has been removed.
  * GUI: the cache cleanup process that's run automatically when
   the GUI starts no longer blocks file identification until it
   is finished. Additionally the process will only be run once
   per release of MKVToolNix. Fixes #1860.
  certain failures during file identification that can be
   traced to broken installations won't be stored in the cache
   anymore. Without this fix the GUI would still use the cached
   failed identification result even though the underlying
   might have already been fixed. 
  multiplexer: changing default values in the preferences (e.g. the
   default track language to set) did not affect files whose
   identification results had already been cached.
  multiplex tool bug fix: under certain circumstances the GUI was
   creating invalid JSON files when starting to multiplex resulting
   in an error message ("JSON option files must contain a JSON
   array consisting solely of JSON strings").
  re-worked the startup code not to use lock files when trying to
   open a socket for communicating with an already-running instance.
   This aims to prevent situations with stale lock files not being
   cleaned up and the GUI not starting anymore as a result.
   This might fix or prevent issues like #1805.
  * A lot of new features and enhancements, please refer to NEWS.md
- Rebased disable-update-check.patch
- spec file cleanup
- Adjusted BuildRequires
  * Since 9.7.1 QT >= 5.3 is required
  * Since 9.7.1 a c++ compiler with some c++14 features is required
    e.g. gcc >= 4.9 or clang >= 3.4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 18:05:23 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 9.6.0
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was entering endless loops under
     certain conditions when appending files.
    MPLS parser bug fix: fixed reading the "in" & "out"
     timestamps for "play items". This bug resulted in mkvmerge
     not reading the correct range from the referenced M2TS file
     under certain rare circumstances.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: job output tool bug fix: the button for
     acknowledging warnings & errors wasn't properly disabled when
     the user used outside methods of acknowledging them
  * mkvextract: VobSub bug fix: mkvextract will add a "langidx"
    line to the .idx file upon extraction.
  * mkvmerge & mkvextract: added support for HDMV TextST subtitles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 27 13:29:56 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 9.5.0
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: The Ogg/OGM reader did not recognize Opus
     files with comment headers anymore.
    WAV reader bug fix: the track properties (channels, samplerate)
     for DTS and AC-3 in WAV will now be derived from the decoded
     bitstream headers instead of the WAV file header as the latter
     is often incorrect.
    WAV reader bug fix: fixed detection and merging of DTS in WAV
     that uses the 14-bytes-in-16-bytes packing method.
    MPEG transport stream reader bug fix: fixed mis-detection of
     certain h.264 files as MPEG transport streams.
    MPEG transport stream reader bug fix: fixed the handling of
     Blu-ray PCM audio with an odd number of channels by removing
     their alignment bytes.
    h.264 elementary stream handling bug fix: if mkvmerge ever
     encounters changing SPS or PPS NALUs (ones where their ID has
     been encountered before with different settings) in the h.264
     then it will prepend all following key frames with all
     currently active SPS and PPS NALUs. This enables playback from
     arbitrary key frames even if they require other SPS or PPS
     settings than the ones stored in the AVCC in CodecPrivate.
    VobSub handling bug fix: mkvmerge and mkvextract will now
     update the duration stored in the SPU bitsream with the
     duration from the container level if it differs at least 1ms.
  * mkvprpedit, MKVToolNix GUI: Added support for "field order"
     video track header element.
- Use GPG signature for verification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 16 15:36:19 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new release 9.4.2:
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: using very large --sync values with certain
     container formats was causing mkvmerge to abort muxing.
    bug fix: fixed an invalid memory access (use after free)
     during global destruction phase.
    bug fix: HEVC parser: fixed three invalid memory accesses.
    bug fix: MP4 reader: fixed an invalid memory access
    bug fix: AAC reader: fixed mkvmerge throwing an uncaught
     exception due to the sample rate being 0.
    bug fix: MP4 reader: an error message will be printed
     instead of an uncaught exception when an invalid atom chunk
     size is encountered during resync.
    bug fix: AVC & HEVC readers: the readers will now refuse to
     handle files where the detected pixel width or height is
     equal to or less than 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  1 15:36:44 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.4.0:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: merge tool bug fix: the automatic adjustments
     to the output file name based on the track types selected for
     muxing and the mechanism for keeping output file names unique
     had been broken since release v9.3.0.
    chapter editor bug fix: overly long chapter names don't cause
     the GUI's window to become overly wide anymore.
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge does no longer emit a warning if no
     comment header packet is found when reading tracks from
     Ogg/OGM files.
    bug fix: VP8 in Ogg: fixed dropping the first frame and the
     timestamp calculation.
    bug fix: when appending files mkvmerge wasn't starting clusters
     on video key frame anymore for the first and all following
     appended files.
    DTS bug fix: if present mkvmerge will use an XLL extension's
     sample rate information as the sample rate to put into
     the track headers.
  * mkvpropedit: bug fix: mkvpropedit will no longer say that it's
     writing the changes if only attachment changes are specified
     and none of the specified attachments can be found.
  * Some enhancements, please refer to the changelog within the
    package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 13:45:45 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.3.1:
  * libebml >= 1.3.4 and libmatroska >= 1.4.5 are now required
  * A lot of bugfixes and new features, new mkv elements are
    supported, for a list of all changes, please refer to the
    changelog provided by the package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 31 11:16:42 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.2.0:
* mkvmerge: bug fix: the "interval" chapter generation mode was
   always creating one chapter too many.
  bug fix: if a certain number of chapters had been generated with
   --generate-chapters then mkvmerge wasn't replacing the void
   placerholder with the actual chapters.
  bug fix: fixed detection of (E-)AC-3 in MPEG TS files with
   unusual stream types (e.g. 0x87) but with (E-)AC-3 PMT
   descriptors.
* mkvmerge, mkvextract: bug fix: fixed handling of Big Endian PCM
   with a bit depth other than 16, 32 or 64 bits/sample. Other
   formats were using the Little Endian codec ID, but their content
   was actually not byte-swapped to match it. Now those other bit
  depths are byte-swapped to Little Endian, too.
* MKVToolNix GUI: merge tool bug fix: the track column "default
   track in output" wasn't taking into account if the track had its
   "default track" flag set to "no" in the source file. This would
   result in the column showing "yes" in certain situations even
   though mkvmerge would assign "no".
* Some other improvements, some enhancements and other bugfixes,
   please refer to the changelog file provides with the package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 17:38:18 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.1.0:
* mkvmerge: bug fix: AVC/h.264: fixed handling of interlaced frames
   with bottom field first.
  bug fix: mkvmerge will no longer abort reading a Matroska file
   with a structural error right before the first cluster.
  bug fix: the "text_subtitles" property of the JSON/verbose
   identification modes was always set to true for all subtitle
   tracks, even for those that aren't text subtitles (VobSub, PG).
  bug fix: the language code signaled in the MPEG TS PMT is taken
   into account when selecting the character encoding to use
   during decoding of the teletext subtitles, not just the
   "national character set" stored in the teletext page headers.
* MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: Fixed huge memory consumption in the
   JSON library by updating said JSON library.
  bug fix: In merge-tool: when adding playlists the GUI won't ask
   the user whether or not to scan if there's only a single
   playlist in that directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 23:06:54 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.0.1:
* mkvmerge: bug fix: regression in v9.0.0: the text subtitle
   packetizer was wrongfully assuming an encoding of UTF-8 if none
   was given instead of assuming the system's encoding. Fixes #1639.
  bug fix: if too many chapters had been generated with
   --generate-chapters then mkvmerge created a bogus entry in the
   meta seek element and did not actually write the chapters to the
   file.
  bug fix: the DTS packetizer was setting the number of
   channels wrong sometimes when reducing to the DTS core. It was
   using the number of channels including the extensions instead of
   the channels of the core only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 28 10:22:11 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.0.0
* mkvmerge: bug fix: fixed two more issues in the conversion of
  teletext subtitles to SRT subtitles.
* mkvmerge: MP4/QuickTime reader: audio tracks with the FourCC
  "lpcm" are muxed as A_PCM/INT/LIT instead of A_QUICKTIME.
* mkvmerge: bug fix: MP4/QuickTime reader: audio tracks can contain
  two instances of certain header fields in the STSD atom;
  mkvmerge now uses the v2 structure over v0, if present.
* mkvextract: new feature: implemented the extraction of Big
  Endian PCM (codec ID A_PCM/INT/BIG) to WAV files. The content will
  be byte-swapped into Little Endian PCM in the process.
* mkvmerge: enhancement: Big Endian PCM tracks will now be
  byte-swapped into Little Endian PCM, and the codec ID
  A_PCM/INT/LIT will be used, as many players do not support BE PCM
  inside MKVs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 22 18:27:27 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 8.9.0

  the time being as it causes problems on high DPI Displays.
* gui: ampersands in file names were shown as keyboard shortcuts
  in tab titles in various tools
* gui: add ability (menu entry) for removing chapters from an
  existing Matroska file.
* Polish translation provided

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 10 13:48:52 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to upstream release 8.8.0:
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: when using one of the
     "select all tracks (of type…)" actions the "properties" column
     didn’t show the selection.
    bug fix: the paths used in the variables and the executable are
     converted to the platforms native path separators.
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: fixed a mis-detection of an MPEG-2 video
     elementary stream as a TrueHD file which then caused a
     segmentation fault.
    bug fix: Matroska attachments with the same name, size and MIME
     type were not output during file identification.
    bug fix: fixed TrueHD detection both as raw streams as well as
     inside other contains if the stream does not start with a
     TrueHD sync frame.
  * Some GUI enhancements and new features, see full changelog:
    https://bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/ChangeLog
- some spec file cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  7 16:01:00 UTC 2016 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to upstream release 8.7.0:
  * all: reversion of a change: several ISO 639-2 codes of languages
      that are very old and not spoken anymore have been re-added
      due to feedback from users who did have a use for such codes.
     reversion of a change: all of the tools will write a byte-order
      mark (BOM) to text files encoded any of the UTF-* schemes again.
  * mkvmerge: bug fix: fixed the key frame detection for VP9 video
      tracks.
     bug fix: chapters were output as both "chapters" and
      "track_tags" in JSON identification mode.
     bug fix: AAC with low sampling frequencies was sometimes 
      mis-detected with the wrong profile preventing appending it
      to other AAC tracks.
     bug fix: the progress calculation was sometimes outputting
      negative numbers when appending Matroska files whose timestamps
      don’t start at 0.
     bug fix: fixed the decisions whether or not to write the last
      frame of a track as a BlockGroup or a SimpleBlock and whether
      or not to write a block duration for that frame.
     bug fix: the Matroska reader now uses TrueHD-specific code
      when reading Matroska files. This can fix things like wrong
      frame type flags.
  * MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: relative file names given on the
      command line were interpreted as being relative to the user’s
      home directory.
     bug fix: the "split mode" drop-down box got reset to
      "do not split" each time the preferences dialog was closed
      with the "OK" button
  * And a lot more enhancements and bugfixes, see full changelog:
    https://bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/ChangeLog

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  5 15:47:20 UTC 2015 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to upstream release 8.6.1:
 * all: MKVToolNix now requires gcc 4.8.0 or later or clang 3.4 or
    later for compilation.
   change: none of the tools will write a byte-order mark (BOM) to
   text files encoded any of the UTF-* schemes anymore.
 * mkvmerge: bug fix: the VC-1 handlig code was duplicating the
    first sequence headers with each mux.
   enhancement: added JSON as an output format for file type
    identification.
   bug fix: fixed two issues causing mkvmerge to write invalid data
    when updating track headers.
   bug fix: the change to do a deeper file analysis if no seek head
    was found was causing huge increases in file type detection time
    as popular tools like x264 don’t write seek heads. The way
    elements at the end are searched has been changed to only scan
    the last 5 MB of the file instead of iterating over every
    level 1 element from the beginning of the file.
 * MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: the options for linking to the
    next/previous segment UID were wrong.
   bug fix: the program changes its working directory to the
    user’s profile/home directory on startup allowing the removal of
    its installation folder even if a program started by the GUI
    (e.g. a web browser) is still running.
   bug fix: in certain situations the modified file would not contain
    a seek head before the first cluster anymore resulting in most
    players not finding elements such as attachments or the index
    located at the end of the file anymore.
 * Some other enhancements and bugfixes, see full changelog:
   https://bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/ChangeLog
- Split package into commandline- (base) and gui-package,
  reduces overhead when installing on a headless system.
- Replaced sed in prep with disable-update-check.patch to disable
  update check on startup (not needed with a package system).
- Added mkvtoolnix-use-system-boost.patch from fedora to fix includes
  when building against boost from system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 22:41:02 UTC 2015 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to upstream release 8.5.2:
 * mkvmerge: bug fix: fixed an endless loop when updating track
    headers caused by the fix for "Re-rendering track headers.
   bug fix: mkvmerge no longer creates a "next segment UID" field
    in the last file when splitting and segment linking is active.
   bug fix: fixed the values of the "previous/next segment UID"
    elements when splitting by parts with segment linking enabled.
 * MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: the file/track columns aren't resized
    to fit their content when expanding/collapsing tree node
    anymore. Such expansion also happened when moving entries with
    the "move up/down" buttons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 22 11:47:36 UTC 2015 - rpm@fthiessen.de

- Update to upstream release 8.5.1 (security update):
* build system: libEBML v1.3.3 and libMatroska v1.4.4 are now
   required due to important fixes for invalid memory accesses in
   those two releases. The copies included in the MKVToolNix source
   code have been updated to those releases as well.
* MKVToolNix GUI: bug fix: the "save file" dialogs did not have
   the currently entered file name pre-selected anymore.
   bug fix: fixed a crash when loading corrupted
   job settings.
   bug fix (Linux): the function "open folder" was
   inserting a superfluous leading slash in the directory name.
* mkvmerge: bug fix: updating the track headers wasn't working in
   some rare cases (corresponding error message "Re-rendering track
   headers: data_size != 0 not implemented yet").
- Disable default setting for checking for updates (nonsense on a
  package system)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* mkvmerge: enhancement: the verbose identification for MP4 files
   will now derive basic audio parameters of MP3 and AC3 tracks
   from the bitstream instead of relying on the values in the
   track headers.
   bug fix: PCM tracks: if the number of samples per
   packet varies then no default duration will be written.
* all: several ISO 639-2 codes of languages that are very old and
   not spoken anymore have been removed.
   new feature: added a Catalan translation of
   the man pages.

* build system: configure will now check for Qt by default.
* A couple of important bugs have been fixed, e.g. a very old bug
  in handling MPEG-1/2 video preventing the detection of such
  tracks; if --sync was used at the same time as --default-duration

- Update to new upstream release 7.6.0
* all programs: bug fix: Since release 7.0.0 the wrong exit code 
  was used when warnings were finished (0 instead of 1).

  PCM tracks from Matroska files in Big Endian byte order.
* all: new feature: added a Serbian (Latin) translation of the
  programs by Danko (see AUTHORS).
* mkvmerge: bug fix: If splitting was active and AC3 tracks read
  from Matroska files were shorter than a split point then the
  following output file would contain an AC3 packet with the
  timecode of 00:00:00 somewhere in the middle.
* mmg: bug fix: If a chapter track from a Matroska file is
  selected then the »language« drop-down box is disabled.
* mmg: bug fix: When scanning for play lists the window presenting
  the results listed some properties in an unescaped way (e.g.
  »\s« instead of spaces).
* mmg: bug fix: When adding MPLS files mmg was only offering to
  scan for more playlists if there were at least two additional
  MPLS files present. This has been fixed to one MPLS file (in
  addition to the one just added).
