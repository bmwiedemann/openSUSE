- Update to 0.0.9.4d
  This is a "sustaining" "rebuild" of the "stable" (that is - users
  know its bugs by now) Quaternion on top of libQMatrixClient 
  0.5.3.1. Unlike previous rebuilds, this incorporates two major
  changes in Quaternion itself, backported from the master branch:

  - (#653) Single sign-on support, to help Mozilla homeserver users
  - (#663) Interoperability with Pantalaimon, to help practically
    any Matrix user who agrees to use Pantalaimon as an E2EE proxy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 08:58:00 UTC 2020 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4c
  - A problem that led to appstream-util validate failure 
    preventing correct construction of Flatpaks has been fixed.
- Run spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 30 07:27:22 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Add missing requires libqt5-qtquickcontrols and 
  libqt5-qtquickcontrols2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 29 10:15:28 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4
  The full lists of (closed issues and commits) are quite long but 
  here are the key additions and changes:
  - Feature (#187): native scrollbars can be used instead of 
    shuttle dials.
  - Feature (#32, #209): attachments support; an image or other 
    file can be posted to a room, with automatic media type 
    detection.
  - Feature (#507): basics of internal navigation 
    (still limited, the work is ongoing):
    - rooms (only those in your room list for now) can be opened 
      using "Open room" dialog (Ctrl-O) - by their id, alias or
      matrix.to URL;
    - direct chats can be opened by entering the user ID or the 
      matrix.to URL into the same dialog;
    - moreover, middle-clicking on a user id/matrix.to link in 
      the timeline also opens a direct chat;
    - navigating to event permalinks is not there yet, pending 
      support in libQMatrixClient (give your votes in 
      QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient#252).
  - Feature (#437): user list can be searched and filtered
  - Feature: support for room versions: room version can be chosen
    when creating a room (not a direct chat though; will be fixed 
    in 0.0.9.5) and is displayed and can be upgraded in the 
    settings room.
  - Feature (#484): Quaternion can use Qt Keychain now to securely
    store access tokens (thanks to @ddanilov). Although this works
    on Windows as well, the Windows binaries available from here 
    don't have it yet.
  - Feature (#123): Timeline can be scrolled using 
    Ctrl-PageUp/PageDown and (if directly focused) Up and Down keys.
    This is a tentative implementation that may work in some edge 
    cases; 0.0.9.5 may bring something more robust.
  - Feature (#277): horizontal scrolling for messages with wide 
    preformatted parts.
  - Feature (#403 and #476): Quaternion can close to tray and also
    start minimised to tray (thanks to @ddanilov and @krkk).
  - Feature (#509/#535): Configurable message quoting (plain text
    only) is implemented. Replies and rich-text quoting are left 
    for a later version.
  - Feature (#455): if the server supports it, room members are 
    lazy-loaded; this should greatly improve initial sync times 
    while otherwise being almost invisible for end users.
  - Enhancement (#445): local echo can be suppressed 
    (UI/suppress_local_echo in config).
  - Enhancement (#451): more actions in right-click menus for the 
    room list and the user list (thanks to @krkk).
  - Enhancement (#381): middle-click on a room name in the room 
    list opens this room; middle-click on a user name in the user
    list opens a direct chat with the user.
  - Enhancement (#448, #483): timeline scrolling is more responsive.
  - Enhancement (#246): when typing a very long message, 
    the message input only increases its height up to a limit, 
    and scrolls after that.
  - Enhancement (#338): similarly, longer multiline topics no more 
    strut the room header to no limit.
  - Enhancement (#505): Quaternion now warns about attempts to 
    login twice into the same account (thanks to @krkk).
  - Enhancement (#491, #471/#478): room creation events and 
    withdrawn invitations (thanks to @krkk) are correctly displayed 
    in the timeline; also unknown state events got a clearer 
    timeline description (even if a bit techy as it uses the state
    event type and key verbatim).
  - Enhancement (#558): better validation of room/user ids in 
    /commands.
  - Enhancement (#500): no more scary "unencrypted" word in the 
    message placeholder text - the used protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) 
    is mentioned instead.
  - Enhancement (#555): /shrug gained an optional text argument.
  - Enhancement: instead of an error message with no clear way out
    expired tokens now lead to a handy re-login dialog.
  - Enhancement: the room settings dialog now shows room id.
  - Enhancement: Ctrl-Q to quit also works on Windows.
  - Bugfix (#546): HTML in author display names is properly 
    escaped.
  - Bugfix (#566): fixed crashing upon logout.
  - Bugfix (#524): fixed crashing after changing the tag order.
  - Bugfix (#532): the login dialog is now prefilled with the 
    first not-logged-in account, rather than an arbitrary account.
  - Bugfix (#559): fixed not remembering the bottommost timeline 
    position after clicking the "Scroll to bottom" button.
  - Bugfix (#564): In the "Add tags" dialog, the Tab key now 
    switches focus instead of entering a Tab character.
  - Bugfix (#486/#488): more accurate logic for user name 
    highlighting (thanks to @redsky17).
  - Bugfix (#511): ban reason is displayed in the timeline now.
  - Bugfix (#542): the to-be-created alias is displayed correctly
    in the room creation dialog (the actually created alias has 
    always been correct).
  - Bugfix (#499): expanded/collapsed state of room groups is 
    correctly remembered and restored.
  - Bugfix (#492): tab order in the login dialog is reasonable 
    now.
  - Bugfix (#490): window title and room caption get updated 
    when the room is renamed etc. now.
  - Bugfix: no more visual glitches when animation duration is 
    configured to 0.
  - General bug fixing and performance tweaking.
  - Lots of work on i18n and l10n

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 18 14:12:55 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4-rc3
  - (#573) Resend and Discard buttons work again
  - (#566) A crash upon logout has been fixed
  - (#577) A confirmation to continue use an unstable version is 
    only displayed now to those who can upgrade rooms
  - Zeroing the animations duration no more leads to artifacts from 
    incomplete animations
  - (#532) Expired access tokens are now processed gracefully, 
    with a prompt to re-login
  - (#564) Hitting Tab in the "Add tags" dialog switches focus as 
    proper instead of entering a tab character

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 12:33:22 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4-rc2
  This Release Candidate fixes two bugs in RC1:
  - Renaming the user no more causes multiple incarnations of it 
    in the user list (this one is also fixed in libQMatrixClient 
    0.5.1.1 but even if you run 0.5.1, it won't happen in 
    Quaternion anymore).
  - The correct account is used to complete users/rooms in the 
    "Open room" dialog.

- Change BuildRequire for libqmatrixclient to 0.5.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  5 07:56:47 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4-rc
  - Fix (#524): Quaternion no more crashes after changing the order
    of tags.
  - Fix (#546): HTML pieces in display names are correctly escaped 
    now.
  - Fix: In Add tags dialog, empty lines are no more treated as 
    empty tag names, just skipped.
  - Fix (#558): Regular expressions checking arguments of 
    slash-commands have been fixed to match the Matrix identifiers 
    grammar - thanks to nepugia.
  - Fix (#559): The bottommost scroll position is also remembered
    if the last thing before switching away from the room was 
    clicking the Scroll to bottom button.
  - Fix (#500): Instead of scaring people away with the word 
    unencrypted, a used protocol is now clearly indicated in the 
    message placeholder line (hopefully, most people using 
    Quaternion do know what HTTP and HTTPS mean).
  - Fix (#542): If the domainpart used by your homeserver does not 
    coincide with the actual domain for connections, Quaternion 
    doesn't confuse you anymore with incorrectly constructed room 
    aliases in the Room settings dialog (e.g., 
    #alias:matrix.example.org instead of #alias:example.org). 
    This was just a visual wart; no actual aliases have been hurt.
  - Fix (#568): uploaded images are displayed in the timeline again,
    after being broken for the most time of 0.0.9.4 development 
    (0.0.9.3 didn't have uploading at all).
  - Enhancement: The room settings dialog now includes the room id.
    A few enhancements have arrived thanks to @krkk:
  - #555: /shrug now accepts optional text after it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  - #557: The text in the users list filter is saved with rooms 
    now; when you switch a room, it's flushed/switched as well.
  - #547: Open room dialog now suggests canonical room aliases 
    (from the local room list) and user ids (from all known users), 
    as you type. Non-canonical aliases need 
    QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient#301 to be fixed (unfortunately,
    it will only come in libQMatrixClient 0.6 due to compatibility 
    breakage).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  3 09:08:53 UTC 2019 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to 0.0.9.4-beta2
  - This version uses the freshly released libQMatrixClient 
    0.5.0.2, fixing issues with upgraded rooms (debug builds no 
    more crash upon seeing some of them) and with v3 rooms 
    (read receipts and redactions now work with v3 rooms too). 
    In case you wonder - #gsoc:matrix.org has been recently 
    upgraded to v3.
  - (#338) The room header no more streches too far on long 
    multiline topics; and along the way, it gained swanky 
    animations!
  - Open room dialog fixed when there's just one account.
  - (#530) Quaternion no more crashes upon attempts to search 
    a user with no room opened. Actually, it even disables the search box for the avoidance of doubt.
  - (#534) Uploading files with no supplementary text works now.
  - Updated translations.
  - CI builds for all platforms including Windows can now be found 
    in one place at bintray.

- Changes from 0.0.9.4-beta1
  - #484: Qt Keychain support to securely store access tokens
  - #507: Finally, some basics of internal navigation from the 
    timeline:
    - rooms can be opened using Open room dialog (Ctrl-O) - by 
      their id, alias or matrix.to URL;
    - moreover, direct chats can be opened by entering the user ID
      or matrix.to URL into the same dialog;
    - and even more, middle-clicking on a user id/matrix.to link 
      in the timeline also opens a direct chat.
    - navigating to event permalinks is not there yet, pending 
      support in libQMatrixClient (give your votes in 
      QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient#252).
  - #187: Native scrollbars can be used instead of shuttle 
    scrollbars.
  - #448, #483: there's been a bit of working on more responsive 
    scrolling. If scrolling still feels unnatural, please leave 
    a note in #483.
  - #123: Timeline can be scrolled using Ctrl-PageUp/PageDown and 
    (if directly focused) Up and Down keys. This is a tentative 
    implementation but is likely to be around at least until 
    0.0.9.5.
  - #32, #209: Attachments support; an image or other file can be 
    posted to a room, with automatic media type detection. 
    No support for thumbnailing yet (which causes #518).
  - #437: User list can be searched and filtered
  - #455: If the server supports it, room members are lazy-loaded; 
    the full list for the given is requested upon switching to it 
    though. Normally this should a no change for end users.
  - #403 and #476: Quaternion can close to tray and also start 
    minimised to tray (thanks to @ddanilov and @krkk).
  - #381: middle-click on a room name in the room list opens this 
    room; middle-click on a user name in the user list opens 
    a direct chat with the user (thanks to @krkk).
  - #517: for those who build from sources: -DUSE_INTREE_LIBQMC is 
    ON by default; however, if CMake doesn't find in-tree library 
    sources, it will try to look around for an installed library 
    development files. Pass -DUSE_INTREE_LIBQMC=OFF to suppress 
    the fallback.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  5 17:51:45 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 0.0.9.3
  - Feature (#323): rooms are grouped by tag now. This is not 
    configurable for now but will be before version 0.1.
  - Feature (#76): Local echo, with buttons to discard and resend
    the message (#390).
  - Feature (#248): Optionally hiding join/leave events and 
    redactions.
  - Feature (#324): Quaternion now has the About dialog box 
    (thanks to @rushsteve1), with information about Git -commits 
    (selectable!) and links to contributors etc.
  - Feature (#372): /ignore and /unignore
  - Feature (#379): /html to send HTML instead of plain text
  - Enhancement (#371): non-members can be /banned too.
  - Enhancement (#370): change the way events are highlighted in 
    the timeline (background is tinted instead of text color 
    changed).
  - Change (#239): by default, Quaternion now compiles against 
    externally installed libQMatrixClient, rather than a submodule. 
    Read BUILDING.md to enable the previous way of building 
    (with lib as a submodule).
- Add language file.
- Need now qt5 >= 5.6 again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 16 11:50:42 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update quaternion to rc0.0.9.3
  - README.md: Refresh documentation
  - Need now libqmatrixclient >= 0.4.0 and qt5 >= 5.10

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 20 10:10:35 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 0.0.9.2
  Another step towards 0.1, this version is based on 
  libQMatrixClient 0.3.0.2 and includes the following changes:
  - Enhancement: the "Settings" menu now has most settings that are 
    worth exposing to the user.
  - Fix (#312): Date label (and author, if you use the new-Default 
    timeline layout) is now correctly hidden when older messages 
    get loaded to the timeline.
  - Experimental: Introduced a new compilation flag, 
    USE_QQUICKWIDGET, switching the way QML is embedded into
    Quaternion; try to use it if you have problems like #355/#356.
  - Unified reporting about failed network requests; 
    show "Consent not given" errors in a user-friendly way.
  - Minor fixes in CI.

- Remove included libmatrixclient and use package libqmatrixclient
  as BuildRequire.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  1 13:33:30 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update quaternion to 0.0.9

    Redactions
    Files downloading (no uploading yet)
    Room creation and editing room settings (the settings are limited for now)
    Support of editing room tags (see in Room settings) and direct chats (right-click on the user in the userlist); grouping rooms by tag will come in Quaternion 0.1
    Support of authenticating proxy servers
    Proper messages to the user about SSL errors including self-signed certificates (and ability to confirm or reject them on individual basis)
    The scrollbar now visualises the current position among already cached events
    Massive treatment of issues with timeline: fonts aligned, lost images no more lost, stick-to-bottom logic works better, smoother and less CPU-hungry scrolling etc.
    Scroll state is remembered on a per-room basis (not across restarts yet)
    No more splash screen, since Quaternion starts up faster now
    As usual, plenty of work on stability, performance and memory footprint
    Thanks to all who helped! Quaternion 0.1 comes soon!


- update libmatrixclient to 0.2.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 19 11:15:08 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- initial version 0.0.5
