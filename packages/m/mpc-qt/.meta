  <description>Media Player Classic Qute Theater

A clone of Media Player Classic reimplemented in Qt.

Media Player Classic Home Cinema is considered by many to be the quintessential media player for the Windows desktop. Media Player Classic Qute Theater (mpc-qt) aims to reproduce most of the interface and functionality of mpc-hc while using libmpv to play video instead of DirectShow.
