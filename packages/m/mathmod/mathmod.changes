- Update to version 11.1:
  * Support of graphing functions with complex numbers Z=u+iv in
    3D and 4D spaces (demo scripts: "Complex3D_xx" and
    "Complex4D_Saddle").
  * Added support for HSV (hue, saturation, lightness) coloring
    model (script: "Complex_Domain_Coloring").
  * Texture definitions (RGB and HSV) for parametric surfaces can
    now be expressed as functions of complex numbers.
  * Added a software implementation for the OpenGL variable
    gl_FrontFacing.
  * Bug-fixes, code optimization and documentation update.
- Drop qt512_no_markdown.patch: incorporated upstream.
- Drop a spurious icon file installed to an incorrect location.

- Update to version 11.0:
  Summary of changes from 6.0 to 11.0

 * Complete rewrite of OpenGL viewer in order to make it OpenGl ES compatible:
    MathMod can now run (or easily adaptable to run) on mobile systems and platforms with limited resources, like RaspberryPi.
 * Add: possibility to show/hide a selected component , two new scripts ("Groupings of Knots" , "Knotted Möbius strips") and OpenGL diffuse/ambient lights setting.
 * Add user defined variables to reduce processing time.
 * Add Texture support for new parameters, possibility to resize up/down the exported meshes, OpenGL specular and shininess setting in the configuration file.
 * Support for mathematical objects made up of parametric and implicit surfaces.
 * Scripts calculations enhancement for parametric and implicit surfaces.
 * Added text information window to give the user an indication of the progress of an operation(threads number, processing time...)
 * Automatic detection and allocation of the right number of threads supported by the hardware.
    (you can however set a desired number of threads from mathmodconfig.js).
 * Add new tool for scripts selection on one or multiple JSON scripts fields.
 * Add option to export OBJ files with vertex colours.
 * Add new scripts to generate math models with chained patterns (Chained Cylinder/Sinusoid).
 * Add support for complex scripts involving more than 100 functions declarations (previous versions were practically limited to less than 12 functions declarations).
 * Bug-fixes, code optimization and documentation update.

- Package changes:
 * Add qt512_no_markdown.patch
    Disable Markdown support for Leap in the editor, since it was added to QtTextEdit in QT-5.14.
    and Leap ships Qt-5.12.
 * Spec-cleaner run and build fixes. 
 * Change license to GPL-2, as per License file in the source tree.
