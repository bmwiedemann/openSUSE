This patch solves the issue raised by CVE-2014-9116 in bug 771125.

We correctly redefine what are the whitespace characters as per RFC5322; by
doing so we prevent mutt_substrdup from being used in a way that could lead to
a segfault.

The lib.c part was written by Antonio Radici <antonio@debian.org> to prevent
crashes due to this kind of bugs from happening again.

The wheezy version of this patch is slightly different, therefore this patch
has -jessie prefixed in its name.
