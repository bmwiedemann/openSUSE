  <title>Name-indexed data processing tool</title>
  <description>Miller (mlr) allows name-indexed data such as CSV and JSON files to be
processed with functions equivalent to sed, awk, cut, join, sort etc. It can
convert between formats, preserves headers when sorting or reversing, and
streams data where possible so its memory requirements stay small. It works
well with pipes and can feed &quot;tail -f&quot;.
