Wed Aug 19 20:26:12 UTC 2020 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 5.9.0
  * You can now save common defaults in a ~/.mlrrc. For example,
    if you normally process CSV files, you can say that in your
    ~/.mlrrc and you can leave off the --csv flag from your mlr
    commands. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  4 06:57:04 UTC 2020 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 5.8.0
  Features:
  * The new count verb is a keystroke-saver for stats -a count
    -f {some field name}`.
  * --jsonx and --ojsonx are keystroke-savers for --json
    --jvstack and --ojson --jvstack, which is to say, multi-line
    pretty-printed JSON format.
  * The new -s name=value feature for mlr put and mlr filter
    gives you simpler access to environment variables in your
    Miller script, as requested in #315.
  Bugfixes:
  * mlr format-values is no longer SEGVing on CSV/TSV input.
    This was reported on #330.
  * #313 fixes a corner case when field names within
    command-line arguments have embedded newlines.
  * Line/column indicators for JSON-formatting error messages
    are now correct (previously they were showing up as 0).
  * end {print NF} no longer SEGVs. This was reported in #330.
  * Several broken doc links were fixed up as reported on #329.

    syntax, as tracked in #274.
  Bugfixes:
  * A bug regarding optional regex-pattern groups was fixed in
    #277.
  * As of #294 you can now specify --implicit-csv-header for the
    join-file in mlr join.
  * A bug with spaces in XTAB-file values was fixed on #296.
  * A bug with missing final newline for XTAB-formatted files
    using MMAP files was fixed on #301.

- Drop group tag

Sun Sep 22 04:53:59 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 5.6.2
  * #271 fixes a corner-case bug with more than 100 CSV/TSV files
    with headers of varying lengths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 13 05:54:23 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 5.6.0
  Features:
  * The new system DSL function allows you to run arbitrary
    shell commands and store them in field values. Some example
    usages are documented here. This is in response to issues #246
    and #209.
  * There is now support for ASV and USV file formats. This is
    in response to issue #245.
  * The new format-values verb allows you to apply numerical
    formatting across all record values. This is in response to
    issue #252.
  Documentation:
  * The new DKVP I/O in Python sample code now works for Python
    2 as well as Python 3.
  * There is a new cookbook entry on doing multiple joins. This
    is in response to issue #235.
  Bugfixes:
  * The toupper, tolower, and capitalize DSL functions are now
    UTF-8 aware, thanks to @sheredom's marvelous
    https://github.com/sheredom/utf8.h. The internationalization
    page has also been expanded. This is in response to issue #254.
  * #250 fixes a bug using in-place mode in conjunction with
    verbs (such as rename or sort) which take field-name lists as
    arguments.
  * #253 fixes a bug in the label when one or more names are
    common between old and new.
  * #251 fixes a corner-case bug when (a) input is CSV; (b) the
    last field ends with a comma and no newline; (c) input is from
    standard input and/or --no-mmap is supplied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  1 06:34:42 UTC 2019 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 5.5.0
  * Positional indexing and other data-cleaning features
    Features:
  * The new positional-indexing feature resolves #236 from
    @aborruso. You can now get the name of the 3rd field of each
    record via $[[3]], and its value by $[[[3]]]. These are both
    usable on either the left-hand or right-hand side of assignment
    statements, so you can more easily do things like renaming
    fields progrmatically within the DSL.
  * There is a new capitalize DSL function, complementing the
    already-existing toupper. This stems from #236.
  * There is a new skip-trivial-records verb, resolving #197.
    Similarly, there is a new remove-empty-columns verb, resolving
    #206. Both are useful for data-cleaning use-cases.
  * Another pair is #181 and #256. While Miller uses mmap
    internally (and invisibily) to get approximately a 20%
    performance boost over not using it, this can cause
    out-of-memory issues with reading either large files, or too
    many small ones. Now, Miller automatically avoids mmap in these
    cases. You can still use --mmap or --no-mmap if you want manual
    control of this.
  * There is a new --ivar option for the nest verb which
    complements the already-existing --evar. This is from #260
    thanks to @jgreely.
  * There is a new keystroke-saving urandrange DSL function:
    urandrange(low, high) is the same as low + (high - low) *
    urand().
  * There is a new -v option for the cat verb which writes a
    low-level record-structure dump to standard error.
  * There is a new -N option for mlr which is a keystroke-saver
    for --implicit-csv-header --headerless-csv-output.
  Documentation:
  * The new FAQ entry
    http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/faq.html#How_to_escape_'%3F'_in_re
    gexes%3F resolves #203.
  * The new FAQ entry
    http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/faq.html#How_can_I_filter_by_date%
    3F resolves #208.
  * #244 fixes a documentation issue while highlighting the need
    for #241.
  Bugfixes:
  * There was a SEGV using nest within then-chains, fixed in
    response to #220.
  * Quotes and backslashes weren't being escaped in JSON output
    with --jvquoteall; reported on #222.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 15 07:23:57 UTC 2018 - Luigi Baldoni <aloisio@gmx.com>

- Update to version 5.4.0
  Features:
  * The new clean-whitespace verb resolves #190 from @aborruso.
    Along with the new functions strip, lstrip, rstrip,
    collapse_whitespace, and clean_whitespace, there is now both
    coarse-grained and fine-grained control over whitespace
    within field names and/or values. See the linked-to
    documentation for examples.
  * The new altkv verb resolves #184 which was originally opened
    via an email request. This supports mapping value-lists such
    as a,b,c,d to alternating key-value pairs such as a=b,c=d.
  * The new fill-down verb resolves #189 by @aborruso. See the
    linked-to documentation for examples.
  * The uniq verb now has a uniq -a which resolves #168 from
    @sjackman.
  * The new regextract and regextract_or_else functions resolve
    #183 by @aborruso.
  * The new ssub function arises from #171 by @dohse, as a
    simplified way to avoid escaping characters which are special
    to regular-expression parsers.
  * There are new localtime functions in response to #170 by
    @sitaramc. However note that as discussed on #170 these do
    not undo one another in all circumstances. This is a
    non-issue for timezones which do not do DST. Otherwise, please
    use with disclaimers: localdate, localtime2sec, sec2localdate,
    sec2localtime, strftime_local, and strptime_local.
  * Travis builds at
    https://travis-ci.org/johnkerl/miller/builds now run on OSX as
    well as Linux.
  * An Ubuntu 17 build issue was fixed by @singalen on #164.
  Documentation:
  * put/filter documentation was confusing as reported by
    @NikosAlexandris on #169.
  * The new FAQ entry
    http://johnkerl.org/miller-releases/miller-head/doc/faq.html#How_
    to_rectangularize_after_joins_with_unpaired? resolves #193 by
    @aborruso.
  * The new cookbook entry
    http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/cookbook.html#Options_for_dealing_
    with_duplicate_rows arises from #168 from @sjackman.
  * The unsparsify documentation had some words missing as
    reported by @tst2005 on #194.
  * There was a typo in the cookpage page
    http://johnkerl.org/miller/doc/cookbook.html#Full_field_renames_a
    nd_reassigns as fixed by @tst2005 in #192.
  Bugfixes:
  * There was a memory leak for TSV-format files only as
    reported by @treynr on #181.
  * Dollar sign in regular expressions were not being escaped
    properly as reported by @dohse on #171.

Tue Jun 20 06:34:53 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 5.2.1
  * Fixes (gh#johnkerl/miller#142) build segfault on non-x86
    architectures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 13 08:06:28 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 5.2.0
  This release contains mostly feature requests.
  Features:
  * The stats1 verb now lets you use regular expressions to
    specify which field names to compute statistics on, and/or which
    to group by. Full details are here.
  * The min and max DSL functions, and the min/max/percentile
    aggregators for the stats1 and merge-fields verbs, now support
    numeric as well as string field values. (For mixed string/numeric
    fields, numbers compare before strings.) This means in particular
    that order statistics -- min, max, and non-interpolated
    percentiles -- as well as mode, antimode, and count are now
    possible on string-only fields. (Of course, any operations
    requiring arithmetic on values, such as computing sums, averages,
    or interpolated percentiles, yield an error on string-valued
    input.)
  * There is a new DSL function mapexcept which returns a copy of
    the argument with specified key(s), if any, unset. The motivating
    use-case is to split records to multiple filenames depending on
    particular field value, which is omitted from the output: mlr
    --from f.dat put 'tee > "/tmp/data-".$a, mapexcept($*, "a")'
    Likewise, mapselect returns a copy of the argument with only
    specified key(s), if any, set. This resolves #137.
  * A new -u option for count-distinct allows unlashed counts for
    multiple field names. For example, with -f a,b and without -u,
    count-distinct computes counts for distinct pairs of a and b field
    values. With -f a,b and with -u, it computes counts for distinct a
    field values and counts for distinct b field values separately.
  * If you build from source, you can now do ./configure without
    first doing autoreconf -fiv. This resolves #131.
  * The UTF-8 BOM sequence 0xef 0xbb 0xbf is now automatically
    ignored from the start of CSV files. (The same is already done for
    JSON files.) This resolves #138.
  * For put and filter with -S, program literals such as the 6 in
    $x = 6 were being parsed as strings. This is not sensible, since
    the -S option for put and filter is intended to suppress numeric
    conversion of record data, not program literals. To get string 6
    one may use $x = "6".
  Documentation:
  * A new cookbook example shows how to compute differences
    between successive queries, e.g. to find out what changed in
    time-varying data when you run and rerun a SQL query.
  * Another new cookbook example shows how to compute
    interquartile ranges.
  * A third new cookbook example shows how to compute weighted
    means.
  Bugfixes:
  * CRLF line-endings were not being correctly autodetected when
    I/O formats were specified using --c2j et al.
  * Integer division by zero was causing a fatal runtime
    exception, rather than computing inf or nan as in the
    floating-point case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 15 07:48:57 UTC 2017 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 5.0.1
  Minor bugfixes:
  * As described in #132, mlr nest was incorrectly splitting
    fields with multi-character separators.
  * The XTAB-format reader, when using multi-character IPS,
    was incorrectly splitting key-value pairs, but only when
    reading from standard input (e.g. on a pipe or less-than
    redirect).
