    <comment>- Updated license
- Update to 5.2.2
  * This bugfix release delivers a fix for #147 where a memory
    allocation failed beyond 4GB.
- Update to version 5.2.1
  * Fixes (gh#johnkerl/miller#142) build segfault on non-x86
    architectures
- Update to version 5.2.0
  This release contains mostly feature requests.
  Features:
  * The stats1 verb now lets you use regular expressions to
    specify which field names to compute statistics on, and/or which
    to group by. Full details are here.
  * The min and max DSL functions, and the min/max/percentile
    aggregators for the stats1 and merge-fields verbs, now support
    numeric as well as string field values. (For mixed string/numeric
    fields, numbers compare before strings.) This means in particular
    that order statistics -- min, max, and non-interpolated
    percentiles -- as well as mode, antimode, and count are now
    possible on string-only fields. (Of course, any operations
    requiring arithmetic on values, such as computing sums, averages,
    or interpolated percentiles, yield an error on string-valued
    input.)
  * There is a new DSL function mapexcept which returns a copy of
    the argument with specified key(s), if any, unset. The motivating
    use-case is to split records to multiple filenames depending on
    particular field value, which is omitted from the output: mlr
    --from f.dat put 'tee &gt; &quot;/tmp/data-&quot;.$a, mapexcept($*, &quot;a&quot;)'
    Likewise, mapselect returns a copy of the argument with only
    specified key(s), if any, set. This resolves #137.
  * A new -u option for count-distinct allows unlashed counts for
    multiple field names. For example, with -f a,b and without -u,
    count-distinct computes counts for distinct pairs of a and b field
    values. With -f a,b and with -u, it computes counts for distinct a
    field values and counts for distinct b field values separately.
  * If you build from source, you can now do ./configure without
    first doing autoreconf -fiv. This resolves #131.
  * The UTF-8 BOM sequence 0xef 0xbb 0xbf is now automatically
    ignored from the start of CSV files. (The same is already done for
    JSON files.) This resolves #138.
  * For put and filter with -S, program literals such as the 6 in
    $x = 6 were being parsed as strings. This is not sensible, since
    the -S option for put and filter is intended to suppress numeric
    conversion of record data, not program literals. To get string 6
    one may use $x = &quot;6&quot;.
  Documentation:
  * A new cookbook example shows how to compute differences
    between successive queries, e.g. to find out what changed in
    time-varying data when you run and rerun a SQL query.
  * Another new cookbook example shows how to compute
    interquartile ranges.
  * A third new cookbook example shows how to compute weighted
    means.
  Bugfixes:
  * CRLF line-endings were not being correctly autodetected when
    I/O formats were specified using --c2j et al.
  * Integer division by zero was causing a fatal runtime
    exception, rather than computing inf or nan as in the
    floating-point case.
