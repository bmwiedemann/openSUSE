    value system for tls_trust_file is used, the result of
    certificate verification was not properly checked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 13 14:58:51 UTC 2019 - Tomas Cech <sleep_walker@opensuse.org>

- use GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL
  https://marlam.de/msmtp/news/openssl-discouraged/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 16 19:20:38 UTC 2019 - Benoît Monin <benoit.monin@gmx.fr>

- update to version 1.8.2:
  * To simplify TLS setup, the tls_trust_file command has a new
    default value 'system' that selects the system default trust.
  * To simplify setup, a new option '--configure <mailaddress>' was
    added that automatically generates a configuration file for a
    given mail address.
- additional changes from version 1.8.1:
  * Fixed our TLS code to support TLS 1.3 with GnuTLS.
- additional changes from version 1.8.0:
  * A minimal SMTP server called msmtpd was added that listens on
    the local host and pipes mails to msmtp (or another program).
    It is intended to be used with system services that cannot be
    configured to call msmtp directly. You can disable it with the
    configure option --without-msmtpd.
  * Using OpenSSL is discouraged and may not be supported in the
    future. Please use GnuTLS instead. The reasons are explained
    here: https://marlam.de/msmtp/news/openssl-discouraged/
  * As using GNU SASL is most likely unnecessary, it is disabled by
    default now. Since everything uses TLS nowadays and thus can
    use PLAIN authentication, you really only need it for GSSAPI.
  * If your system requires a library for IDN support, libidn2 is
    now used instead of the older libidn.
  * The CRAM-MD5 authentication method is marked as obsolete /
    insecure and will not be chosen automatically anymore.
  * The passwordeval command does not require the password to be
    terminated by a new line character anymore.
  * The new logfile_time_format command allows to customize log
    file time stamps.
  * Builtin default port numbers are now used instead of consulting
    /etc/services.
  * Support for DJGPP and for systems lacking vasprintf(),
    mkstemp(), or tmpfile() is removed.
- additional changes from version 1.6.8:
  * Add --source-ip option and source_ip command to bind the
    outgoing connection to a specific source IP address.
  * Enable SNI for TLS
- additional changes from version 1.6.7:
  * Add support for ~/.config/msmtp/config as configuration file
  * Add network timeout handling on Windows
  * Fix command line handling of SHA256 TLS fingerprints
  * Fix SIGPIPE handling (affects at least Mac OS X)
  * Add french translation, and update german translation
- update Url and Source to marlam.de, see:
  https://marlam.de/msmtp/news/project-moved/
- update the keyring, the previous one has been revoked
- switch to libidn2 to match msmtp requirement
- configure with openssl as tls library

- additional changes from 1.6.0:
  * Support for SOCKS proxies was added. This allows msmtp to be
    used with Tor.
  * GNOME Keyring support now uses libsecret instead of
    libgnome-keyring. It is now documented how to use secret-tool
    to manage passwords for msmtp; the obsolete msmtp-gnome-tool
    script is removed.
  * Configuration file security is now only checked if the file
    actually contains secrets such as passwords.
  * The GSSAPI authentication method is not chosen automatically
    anymore, you have to request it manually if you really want to
    use it.
  * From: and Date: headers are now added to mails if necessary, for
    compatibility with sendmail, postfix, exim, and other MTAs. This
    can be disabled with the add_missing_from_header and
    add_missing_date_header commands.
  * Libidn is not required for IDN support anymore on systems where
    getaddrinfo() supports the AI_IDN flag and the GnuTLS version
    is >= 3.4.0.
  * The new remove_bcc_headers command replaces the old keepbcc
    command (but the old command is still supported for
    compatibility).
  * SSLv3 is disabled, and the obsolete tls_force_sslv3 command and
    --tls-force-sslv3 option have no effect anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 15:28:11 UTC 2009 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.4.19
  - When using OpenSSL, msmtp now correctly handles NUL characters
    in the Common Name and Subject Alternative Name fields of
    certificates. This fixes a security problem. Note that msmtp is
    not affected by this problem if GnuTLS is used. (bnc#557181)
  - Disable security checks on the user configuration file when run
    as root.  Fixes Debian bug #534829.

    may be needed to use TLS/SSL with servers that use a small
    Diffie-Hellman (DH) prime size.
  - The configuration command tls_priorities was added. This allows
    to fine tune TLS/SSL session parameters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  6 18:32:26 CEST 2008 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to version 1.4.16
  - Changed all scripts to '#!/usr/bin/env bash' instead of
    '#!/bin/sh' or '#!/bin/bash', because they use bash features
    that are not available in POSIX /bin/sh and because bash might
    not live in /bin, e.g. on BSD systems. This is a quick fix for
    Debian bug #489635.
  - Accept both 250 and 251 in return of the RCPT TO command, as
    required by RFC 2821 sections 4.3.2 and 3.4. Reported and fixed
    by Matthias Bernhardt.  Thanks!
  - Fix scripts/msmtpqueue/msmtp-runqueue.sh. An error made while
    applying a patch accidently broke it. Reported by Thomas Weber.
    Thanks!
    (this obsoletes msmtp-runqueue.sh.patch)
- additional changes from version 1.4.15
  - Added the new tls_crl_file configuration command and the
    corresponding --tls-crl-file option.
  - Added the new tls_min_dh_prime_bits configuration command and
    the corresponding --tls-min-dh-prime-bits option. This closes
    Debian bug #440344.
  - Added the new tls_priorities configuration command and the
    corresponding --tls-priorities option.
  - Gnulib upate to 2008-06-02. Use getpass-gnu instead of getpass
    module.
  - Add msmtpq scripts by Chris Gianniotis to the scripts
    directory. Suggest them as a replacement in the README of the
    msmtpqueue scripts.
  - Do not let getpass() read from stdin, because we read the mail
    from there.  Reported by Karol Lewandowski. Thanks!
  - Updated the set_sendmail script by Gautam Iyer. Thanks!
  - Return EX_TEMPFAIL instead of EX_DATAERR in case of  4xx
    replies to the MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and DATA commands. Reported
    by Kent Vinther Friis. Thanks!
- install msmtpq

- update to 1.4.11:
  - Require either tls_trust_file or tls_certcheck=off for TLS
    sessions, so that msmtp is not silently vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Do not use NTLM authentication automatically anymore unless TLS
    is active.  NTLM is not an open standard and must therefore be
    considered broken.
  - Gnulib update 2007-04-07.

- update to 1.4.10:
  - Updated copyright info to 2007.
  - Gnulib update to 2007-01-10.
  - From mpop: Switch to autoconf-2.61 and automake-1.10, to avoid
    problems with configure trying to run "sh /usr/bin/install"
    where /usr/bin/install is not a shell script on NetBSD.
    Reported by Jeremy C. Reed.
  - From mpop: Remove the obsolete "extern int errno;" declaration.
    It does not conform to POSIX and causes trouble. Thanks to
    Jeremy C. Reed for the patch.
  - Added AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to configure.ac, for large file support.
    Removed the unnecessary AC_C_CONST and AC_HEADER_STDC.
