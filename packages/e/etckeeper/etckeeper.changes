- Do not have the main package recommend the bash-completion
  sub-package, but rather have the subpackage supplement the
  combination of etckeeper and bash-completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 02:32:00 UTC 2022 - André Werlang <beppe85@gmail.com>

- Update to 1.18.18:
  * Replace deprecated egrep with grep -E.
  * Added support for Void Linux's xbps package manager.
- Update to 1.18.17:
  * Fix committing of files with spaces in name when perl is not available.
  * Ignore udev's FHS violating large binary cache file /etc/udev/hwdb.bin
  * Avoid warning messages from grep about binary files when there are
    filenames in /etc that do not correspond to the current locale settings.
- Update to 1.18.16:
  * Improve sorting stability.
  * Prefer mktemp over tempfile as the latter displays a deprecation
    warning since debianutils 4.10.
- Update to 1.18.15:
  * Use "command -v" rather than "which" to detect installed programs,
    as it is more portable.
  * Improve commit messages generated by package manager changes,
    listing packages that are responsible for the changed config files.
  * If gc.auto is not configured, override the default to make it gc
    ten times more frequently, to avoid wasting space with loose objects.
  * update-ignore: Preserve permissions from any preexisting VCS ignore file.
  * Removed the debian directory from the upstream source package as it's
    not being maintained; see the debian package for an up-to-date one.
  * debian/changelog moved to CHANGELOG and debian/copyright to COPYRIGHT.
- Rebase patches:
  * etckeeper-avoid-packagelist.patch
  * etckeeper-set-package-manager.patch

    Thanks, Christian Hesse
  * Fix vcs subcommand setup for zsh completion.
    Thanks, James Rowe.
  * Added zsh completion.
    Thanks, James Rowe
  * commit: Recent changes added code that does not work on all POSIX shells.
    Fixed by Thorsten Glaser.
  * Fix bug in hostname determination in the previous release.
    Thanks, Christian Hesse
  * Support platforms without a hostname command, fall back to 
    reading /etc/hostname.
    Thanks, Chris Morgan
  * commit: Support -mmessage, without a space, since eg git commit
    can be used that way.
    Thanks, martin f. krafft
  * commit: When multiple parameters are given, use them all as the commit
    message, instead of the old behavior of only using the first parameter and
    throwing the rest away.
    Thanks, martin f. krafft
  * Avoid post-install failing when ps is from busybox or another
    version not supporting procps-specific options.
  * Use ps --no-headers rather than problimatic -h option.
  * When run during a package installation, include in the commit
    message the command line that caused etckeeper to run.
    Thanks, Laszlo Gombos

Tue Oct  2 09:38:10 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Remove idempotent %if..%endif guards.
- Fix incorrect trailing slash in make install line.
- Update RPM group for bash-completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 30 07:09:48 UTC 2018 - bkbin005@rinku.zaq.ne.jp

- indicated that subpackages are noarch.
- modified the description longer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 13 07:34:35 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- obsolete cron sub package on systemd machines

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 13 07:29:24 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- use %license

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 12 23:31:38 UTC 2018 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- dropped non suse support
  - added etckeeper-set-package-manager.patch: set the package
    manager via a patch now that we only care about suse
- bzr support:
  - disable for now as it would force the whole package to be
    python2 bound. you can reenable it when building with
    --with=bzr or set the options in your prjconf:
    %define _with_bzr 1
    Macros:
    %_with_bzr 1
    :Macros
  - change bzr support to be in a subpackage if enabled
- build with python3 when not building with bzr support
  - patch shebang line in the zypper plugin to match that
- build the whole package as noarch if we don't build with python
  as we are just packaging a bunch of shell scripts
- move bash completion to a sub package, which is recommended to
  keep the default working, BR and Require the bash-completion
  package for path ownership
- downgrade to git-core so we only have the minimal git for small
  installs on servers
- no longer build the cron support on systemd machines. the systemd
  timer is more powerful and should be used instead.
- when uninstalling we should also disable and stop the systemd
  timer
- only ship the documentation files that are also shipped in the
  debian package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 11 07:34:30 UTC 2018 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update to 1.18.8:
  * Work around git commit's lack of robustness, by providing
    reasonable default values for GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL etc.
    This was already done as part of the su/sudo handling,
    and is now always done.
  * Don't hardcode the master branch when pushing to PUSH_REMOTE.
    Instead, let git push whatever branches it is configured to
    push to that remote.
- Drop 0001-Remove-env-from-shebang-in-zypper-plugin.patch because
  now in upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 18 07:35:13 UTC 2017 - aavindraa@gmail.com

- update to 1.18.7:
  * Will work on systems that don't have perl. (Perl is still used
    when available).
  * Prevent LC_ALL overriding the LC_COLLATE used to sort metadata.
- includes changes from 1.18.6:
  * Only show errors (no progress indicators) when pushing
    Git/Mercurial repos to avoid unecessary cron mails.
  * Fix regex in 20-warn-problem-files.
  * Support added for apk (alpine linux)
- Lint spec file
- Point source URL to upstream tarball
- Mark dependency on python-base per rpmlint
- Patches / source modifications:

    - fixes rpmlint warning about dependency detection
  * Rebase etckeeeper-avoid-packagelist.patch
  * Remove junk file caught by rpmlint (.mdwn)

Sat Oct 22 17:39:27 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Remove redundant sections

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 15 09:34:41 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update Source to 1.18.5:
  - Make etckeeper commit store metadata changes. The pre-commit 
    hook has always (and continues) to do that, but pre-commit is 
    only run when there are changes to tommit. This makes 
    metadata-only changes get committed.
  - Move systemd files to /lib/systemd; /usr/lib/systemd is not 
    used on Debian.
- fix wrong path for systemd in rpm based distros with sed in spec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  3 10:09:23 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update Source to 1.18.4:
  - Optimised find for special and hard linked files.
  - Adjust when Pacman 5 calls etckeeper hooks.
  - Only run Pacman hooks when files in /etc have changed.
  - Added systemd timer that can run etckeeper 10 minutes after boot, and also
    daily. It's not enabled by default, partly because of overlap with the
    cron job.
- update Source to 1.18.3:
  - Added support for pacmatic, contributed by nicolaichuk.
  - bzr: make sure EMAIL is defined
  - Fix Makefile version patterns to ignore non-native version number
  - Support ~/.config/git/config when determining the author name and email.
  - Added support for Arch's pacman package manager version 5.
  - Set HOME if it's not set, as is the case when using ubuntu's
    update-manager.
  - Move bash completion out of etc and into usr.
- update Source to 1.18.2:
  - Use getent utility instead of perl. (Elan Ruusamäe)
  - Initial FreeBSD support with pkgng plugin. (William Johansson)
  - Fix README.md symlink in package (Sebastian Schmidt, Antoine Beaupré,
    closes: #791566)
  - Fix typo of GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL.
- update Source to 1.18.1
  - Add myself as maintainer (Closes: #768516)
  - Keeping the package native as I do not intend to diverge from
    upstream.
  - Update git URL in control file.
- update to Sourcce to 1.18:
  - Send yum pre-commit output to /dev/null
  - Set LANG=C internally when doing some operations that have
    been reported to fail in other locales.
- update Source to 1.17:
  - Fix name of DNF plugin.
  - Add --version
    Thanks Andreas Wansner.
  - New website, http://etckeeper.branchable.com/
  - Add build-depends on dh-python.
- update Source to 1.16:
  - Added support for Fedora's DNF highlevel package manager.
  - Add architecture info to dpkg list-installed. Closes: #768145
  - Orphaned the Debian package.
- rebase patch etckeeper-avoid-packagelist.patch
- change source url to github
- remove unnecessary file etckeeper-rpmlintrc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  3 09:05:31 UTC 2016 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- update Source to 1.15:
  - Recommend cron-daemon, rather than cron, as etckeeper only needs
    cron.daily functionality. Closes: #762721
- update Source to 1.14:
  - Handle failure to commit in post-install, pre-install by showing a
    warning, rather than propigating the error to apt.
    This avoids breaking the apt run when eg, git is misconfigured and
    cannot commit.
    pre-install already did this when it was able to use debconf to display a
    message, but now debconf is not used, and it always behaves this way.
    Closes: #760011
- change to new url

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 18 11:55:42 UTC 2014 - bkbin005@rinku.zaq.ne.jp

Fri Aug 15 22:15:20 UTC 2014 - bkbin005@rinku.zaq.ne.jp

- updated Source to 1.13:
  + Ignore check-mk-agent-logwatch's FHS violating
    /etc/check_mk/logwatch.state. Closes: deb#753903
  + Only allow [-a-z_] in etckeeper commands to avoid any possible
    directory traversal etc issues.
  + update-ignore, uninit: Fix parsing of ignore files containing '\'
- added etckeeper-avoid-packagelist.patch:
  Because it is slow that some package manager make the packagelist
  (eg, rpm -qa), high-level package manager might time out
  (eg. zypper in/remove).
  So I added this patch.
  If you think that the packagelist is unnecessary,
  set AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1 in etckeeper.conf.
  Or if you want to avoid it temporarily,
  you can use environment variable ETCKEEPER_AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1 .
  (eg, ETCKEEPER_AVOID_PACKAGELIST=1 zypper update).
  This patch was sent to upstream, but Joey does not accept it yet.
  Please see also gh#joeyh/etckeeper#17 .
- rename subpackage from pkgmanager-collabo
  to zypp-plugin or yum-plugin.
  please see also:

- added bzr support files.
  Their files need "Buildrequires: python-devel bzr",
  but did not write them, so they were not installed untill now.
- added Python Compatibility with older distributions codes.
  Please see also:
  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Python#Compatibility_with_older_distributions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  7 21:21:34 UTC 2014 - bkbin005@rinku.zaq.ne.jp

- modified etckeeper.spec style
  by "osc service run format_spec_file".
- removed lint code 'rm -rf "%{buildroot}%{_prefix}/lib"/python*'.
  This line does not work.
- removed "Requires: git".
