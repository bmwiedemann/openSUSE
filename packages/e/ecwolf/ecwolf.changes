  * LAN multiplayer for up to 11 players.
  * Actors now track their current target instead of assuming the
    one and only player.
  * Visibility for attacks is determined by geometric checks
    instead of renderer feedback.
  * The "DoomEdNum" has been deprecated and all places where they
    were used now accept actor class names directly.
  * Support for BILLBOARD flag for "3D sprites", compared to
    Wolf4SDL the angle of the actor is used allowing arbitrary
    angles.
  * Added parallax skies compatible with ROTT through sky1 in
    MAPINFO/Map definition (mostly incompatible with LZWolf's
    parallaxsky definition)
  * Added support for Wolfstone 3D and Elite Hans: Die Neue Ordnung
  * Added pageindextext to MAPINFO/Gameinfo.
  * Added $musicalias to SNDINFO.
  * Added Super 3-D Noah's Ark MIDI->OPL code.
  * Fading has been reworked to allow overlaying fades over game
    play.
  * Support for blend and alpha mixing in TEXTURES.
  * Support for colormaps with 64 light levels like Blake Stone.
  * Partial support for Blake Stone map meta data.
  * Support for Blake Stone's level name strings as LEVELDSC.
  * Support for Macintosh Wolf3D's MAPLIST.
  * Added support for offset() in DECORATE states.
  * Pickups support Hide state to allow spent pickups to be visible
  * Added Idle state for actors to return to if they lose their
    target.
  * Files can be autoloaded though ecwolf.cfg.
  * Added game based content filtering for PK3s from ZDoom.
  * Default FOV can be changed through DesiredFOV in ecwolf.cfg.
  * Added Pushwall_MoveNoStop line special which allows moving
    pushwalls through walls like Mac Wolf and ROTT.
  * Added Teleport_Relative line special which works similarly to
    ROTT elevators without the theatrics.
  * Wall and plane drawing has been modified to generally have
    better precision.
  * Added trackhighscores property to MAPINFO/Gameinfo.
  * Added resethealth and resetinventory to MAPINFO/Map
    definition.
  * Enemies can now accept health items.
  * Added A_Wander.
  * Added SmartAnimation actor to support Blake Stone's "smart
    animation" system.
  * Added --foreignsaves option to force saves to load even if
    game data check fails.
  * Added --skill option to select skill level by number
    particularly for when more than 4 skill levels are present.
  * Added ROTT style tall walls and ROTT's map height marker with
    feature flag "planedepth".
  * Actor z-heights are now rendered and can be set in info plane
    with "zheights" enabled in map translator (compatible with
    ROTT).
  * ROTT map loader no longer synthesizes a third plane but
    instead relies on the map translator flag "globalflat".
  * Support for ROTT's song numbers in map translator.
  * Partial support for booting Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D,
    Blake Stone: Planet Strike, and Rise of the Triad.
  * Includes support for several new data formats most of which
    have no practical use outside of loading vanilla compatible
    data.
  * Macintosh Wolfenstein 3D data is supported through macbin
    format.
  * Feature is hidden behind ShowPreviewGames in ecwolf.cfg as
    they're not yet supported or fully playable.
  * Improvements in holowall support.
  * Fixed some long standing minor memory leaks.
  * New icon/logo by NeuralStunner.
  * Support for more ultrawide aspect ratios.
  * Automap panning speed is now dependent on zoom level.
  * Fixed crash if no sound device was present.
  * Fixed cases where adaptive frame rate would fail and game would
    run too fast.
  * Customized SDL_mixer is still suggested but no longer required
    for full functionality as the only feature missing is support
    for alternate spelling of LOOP_START and LOOP_END tags.
  * Steam and GOG support updated to support new releases.
  * Remove patchutil from ECWolf source code
