.TP
.B \-f <text file>
Text file to speak
.TP
.B \-\-stdin
Read text input from stdin instead of a file
.TP
If neither -f nor --stdin, <words> are spoken, or if none then text is spoken from stdin, each line separately.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet, don't produce any speech (may be useful with -x)
.TP
.B \-a <integer>
Amplitude, 0 to 20, default is 10
.TP
.B \-l <integer>
Line length. If not zero (which is the default), consider
lines less than this length as and-of-clause
.TP
.B \-p <integer>
Pitch adjustment, 0 to 99, default is 50
.TP
.B -s <integer>
Speed in words per minute, default is 160
.TP
.B \-v <voice name>
Use voice file of this name from espeak-data/voices
.TP
.B -b
Input text is 8-bit encoding
.TP
.B -m
Indicates that the text contains SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags or other XML tags. Those SSML tags which are supported are interpreted. Other tags, including HTML, are ignored, except that some HTML tags such as <hr> <h2> and <li> ensure a break in the speech.
.TP
.B \-w <wave file name>

.TP
.B \-x

Speak the names of punctuation characters during speaking. If =<characters> is omitted, all punctuation is spoken.
.TP
.B \-k <integer>
Indicate capital letters with: 1=sound, 2=the word "capitals", higher values = a pitch increase (try -k20).

.B \-\-voices[=<language code>]
Lists the available voices. If =<language code> is present then only those voices which are suitable for that language are listed.
.TP
.B \-\-compile=voicename
