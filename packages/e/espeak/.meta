  <title>Software speech synthesizer (text-to-speech)</title>
  <description>eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English
and other languages.

eSpeak uses a &quot;formant synthesis&quot; method. This allows many languages to
be provided in a small size. The speech is clear, and can be used at
high speeds, but is not as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers
which are based on human speech recordings.</description>
