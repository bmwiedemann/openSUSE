- Update to version 1.48.04
  + Corrections to languages en, nl, ta (rules, list, and dict files)
- Changes from version 1.48.03
  + Fix bug, use of the command-line  "espeakedit --compile" produced

    gradual increase.
  + Fix bug:  SSML <break time=""> with values greater than 23 seconds
    were ignored due to arithmetic overflow.

  + Language changes include: da, en, fa, gu, hu, it, nl, pt, ta

    all words in the *_list file which don't have the $only attribute.
