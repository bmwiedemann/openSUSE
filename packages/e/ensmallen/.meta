  <title>Efficient math optimization C++ library</title>
  <description>ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective 
function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and 
cutting-edge optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical 
optimization task. These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, 
small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, 
and constrained optimization.</description>
