- Changes for 23.1.1:
  * erts: inet:setopts([{active,once}]) wakes up IO polling thread
    unnecessarily, leading to lock contention and visibly higher
    CPU utilization.
  * erts: Two bugs in the ERTS internal thread wakeup functionality
    have been fixed. These bugs mainly hit when all threads in the
    system tried to go to sleep. When the bugs were triggered,
    certain operations were delayed until a thread woke up due to
    some other reason. Most important operations effected were code
    loading, persistent term updates, and memory deallocation.
  * erts: Fixed bug in ets:select_replace/2 on compressed tables
    that could produce faulty results or VM crash. Bug exists since
    OTP 20.
  * erts: When compiling Erlang/OTP on macOS using Xcode 12, the
    performance of the BEAM interpreter would be degraded.
  * erts: As of OTP 22, the allocator specific memory carrier pools
    were replaced by a node global carrier pool. This unfortunately
    caused substantial memory fragmentation in some cases due to
    long lived data being spread into carriers used by allocators
    mainly handling short lived data. A new command line argument
    +M<S>cp has been introduced with which one can enable the old
    behavior as well as configuring other behaviors for the carrier
    pools. In order to configure the old behavior, with allocator
    specific carrier pools for all allocators, pass +Mucp :
    (including the colon character) as a command line argument to
    erl when starting the Erlang system. The default configuration
    for carrier pools will be changed to +Mucp : some time in the
    future, but not in this patch.
  * os_mon: The configuration parameter
    memsup_improved_system_memory_data has been introduced. It can
    be used to modify the result returned by
    memsup:get_system_memory_data(). For more information see the
    memsup documentation. Note that the configuration parameter is
    intended to be removed in OTP 24 and the modified result is
    intended to be used as of OTP 24.
  * ssh: Fix decoder bug.
  * compiler: Fixed a performance bug that could be triggered by
    tuple matching in very large functions.
  * public_key: Fix the issue that pem_decode will crash with an
    invalid input.
- Changes for 23.1:
  * kernel: A fallback has been implemented for file:sendfile when
    using inet_backend socket
  * kernel: Make default TCP distribution honour option backlog in
    inet_dist_listen_options.
  * kernel: Raw option handling for the experimental gen_tcp_socket
    backend was broken so that all raw options were ignored by for
    example gen_tcp:listen/2, a bug that now has been fixed.
    Reported by Jan Uhlig.
  * kernel: Accept fails with inet-backend socket.
  * kernel: Fixed various minor errors in the socket backend of
    gen_tcp.
  * kernel: Correct disk_log:truncate/1 to count the header. Also
    correct the documentation to state that disk_log:truncate/1 can
    be used with external disk logs.
  * kernel: Fix erl_epmd:port_please/2,3 type specs to include all
    possible error values.
  * kernel: Fix erl -erl_epmd_port to work properly. Before this
    fix it did not work at all.
  * kernel: Fix typespec for internal function
    erlang:seq_trace_info/1 to allow term() as returned label. This
    in turn fixes so that calls to seq_trace:get_token/1 can be
    correctly analyzer by dialyzer.
  * kernel: Fix erroneous double registration of processes in pg
    when distribution is dynamically started.
  * kernel: Make (use of) the socket registry optional (still
    enabled by default). Its now possible to build OTP with the
    socket registry turned off, turn it off by setting an
    environment variable and controlling in runtime (via function
    calls and arguments when creating sockets).
  * kernel: erl -remsh nodename no longer requires the hostname to
    be given when used together with dynamic nodenames.
  * observer: Fix graph windows flickering on windows.
  * mnesia: FIx mnesia delete object handling in transaction
    storage. In a transaction mnesia:read/1 could indicate that
    exiting objects did not exist after another object was deleted.
  * mnesia: Fixed crash during startup, which could happen if a
    table was deleted on another node.
  * stdlib: The functions digraph:in_edges/2 and
    digraph:out_edges/2 would return false edges if called for a
    vertex that had a '_' atom in its name term.
  * stdlib: filelib:wildcard("not-a-directory/..") should return an
    empty list. On Windows it returned "not-a-directory/..".
  * stdlib: Fix the typespec of shell_docs:render to use the
    correct type for an MFA.
  * stdlib: Fix uri_string:recompose/1 when host is present but
    input path is not absolute. This change prevents the recompose
    operation to change the top level domain of the host when the
    path does not start with a slash.
  * stdlib: The epp module would return a badly formed error term
    when an 'if' preprocessor directive referenced an undefined
    symbol. epp:format_error/1 would crash when called with the bad
    error term.
  * stdlib: lists:sublist(List, Start, Len) failed with an
    exception if Start > length(List) + 1 even though it is
    explicitly documented that "It is not an error for Start+Len to
    exceed the length of the list".
  * tools: Correct the Xref analysis locals_not_used to find
    functions called exclusively from on_load functions.
  * erts: Update the documentation of the abstract format to use
    ANNO instead of LINE.
  * erts: The emulator will no longer revert to the default number
    of schedulers when running under a CPU quota lower than 1 CPU.
  * erts: Fixed a problem with crash dumps. When a process that
    contained reference to literals internally created by the
    runtime system (such as the tuple returned by os:type/0), the
    literal would not be included in the crash dump and the
    crashdump viewer would complain about the heap being
    incomplete.
  * erts: Fix configure detection of PGO for clang.
  * erts: The to_erl program has been fixed to correctly interpret
    newline as only newline and not newline+return. This bug would
    cause the terminal to behave strangely when using lines longer
    than the terminal size.
  * erts: A race condition when changing process priority by
    calling process_flag(priority, Prio) could cause elevation of
    priority for a system task to be ignored. This bug hit if the
    system task was scheduled on the process calling process_flag()
    at the same time as the priority was changed. The bug is quite
    harmless and should hit very seldom if ever.
  * erts: Adjust /bin/sh to /system/bin/sh in scripts when
    installing on Android.
  * erts: In rare circumstances, when loading a BEAM file generated
    by an alternative code generator (not the Erlang compiler in
    OTP) or from handwritten or patched BEAM code, the loader could
    do an unsafe optimization.
  * erts: A memory and file descriptor leak in socket has been
    fixed. (When a newly opened socket that had not entered the fd
    into the VM's poll set (neither received, sent, accepted nor
    connected) was abandoned without closing (process died), after
    assigning a different controlling process, then a memory block
    and the file descriptor could be leaked.)
  * erts: The documentation of statistics(run_queue) erroneously
    stated that it returns the total length of all normal run
    queues when it is the total length of all normal and dirty CPU
    run queues that is returned. The documentation has been updated
    to reflect the actual behavior.
  * erts: Changes in order to build on the Haiku operating system.
    Thanks to Calvin Buckley
  * erts: When building the inet driver on Windows, there where
    many compiler warnings regarding type casting (used when
    calling the debug macro). This has now been resolved.
  * erts: Make (use of) the socket registry optional (still enabled
    by default). Its now possible to build OTP with the socket
    registry turned off, turn it off by setting an environment
    variable and controlling in runtime (via function calls and
    arguments when creating sockets).
  * erts: Change default filename encoding on android to UTF-8.
  * erts: Clarification of the format of the atom cache header used
    by the distribution.
  * erl_docgen: Repaired lost function "since" versions in the
    right margin of the module reference HTML documentation.
  * erl_docgen: Remove erlang compilation warnings and trailing
    whitespaces.
  * ftp: Avoid timing issue when setting active once on a socket
    that is being closed by the peer.
  * ftp: Avoid timing issue when setting active once on a socket
    that is being closed by the peer.
  * dialyzer: In rare circumstance, dialyzer wold crash when
    analyzing a list comprehension.
  * eunit: Fixed compiler warning.
  * snmp: For agent fix PrivParams for SNMPv3 USM with AES privacy,
    as earlier fixed for the manager in OTP_16541.
  * snmp: The SNMP Agent missed to re-activate datagram reception
    in an odd timeout case and went deaf. This bug has been fixed.
  * snmp: Use of deprecated functions in example 2 has been removed
    (no more compiler warnings).
  * snmp: A file descriptor leak has been plugged. When calling the
    reconfigure function of a mib, it opened the config file(s) but
    never closed them on successful read.
  * asn1: Changes in order to build on the Haiku operating system.
    Thanks to Calvin Buckley
  * syntax_tools: Minor documentation fix of erl_syntax:operator/1.
  * erl_interface: Fix erl_interface on windows to be compiled with
    correct flags to make internal primitives reentrant.
  * erl_interface: Fixed ei_get_type to set *size to zero for
    floats, pids, port and refs according to documentation.
  * erl_interface: Fix ei_connect when using a dynamic node name to
    force usage of distribution version 6. This bug caused erl_call
    -R -address to not work properly.
  * erl_interface: Changes in order to build on the Haiku operating
    system. Thanks to Calvin Buckley
  * erl_interface: The ei API for decoding/encoding terms is not
    fully 64-bit compatible since terms that have a representation
    on the external term format larger than 2 GB cannot be handled.
  * ssl: If a passive socket is created, ssl:recv/2,3 is never
    called and then the peer closes the socket the controlling
    process will no longer receive an active close message.
  * ssl: Data deliver with ssl:recv/2,3 could fail for when using
    packet mode. This has been fixed by correcting the flow control
    handling of passive sockets when packet mode is used.
  * ssl: This change fixes a potential man-in-the-middle
    vulnerability when the ssl client is configured to
    automatically handle session tickets ({session_tickets, auto}).
  * ssl: Fix the internal handling of options 'verify' and
    'verify_fun'. This change fixes a vulnerability when setting
    the ssl option 'verify' to verify_peer in a continued handshake
    won't take any effect resulting in the acceptance of expired
    peer certificates.
  * ssl: This change fixes the handling of stateless session
    tickets when anti-replay is enabled.
  * ssl: Fix a crash due to the faulty handling of stateful session
    tickets received by servers expecting stateless session
    tickets. This change also improves the handling of
    faulty/invalid tickets.
  * ssl: Correct flow ctrl checks from OTP-16764 to work as
    intended. Probably will not have a noticeable affect but will
    make connections more well behaved under some circumstances.
  * ssl: Distribution over TLS could exhibit livelock-like
    behaviour when there is a constant stream of distribution
    messages. Distribution data is now chunked every 16 Mb to avoid
    that.
  * ssl: Implement the cookie extension for TLS 1.3.
  * ssl: Experimental OCSP client support.
  * ssl: TLS 1.0 -TLS-1.2 sessions tables now have a absolute max
    value instead of using a shrinking mechanism when reaching the
    limit. To avoid out of memory problems under heavy load
    situations. Note that this change infers that implementations
    of ssl_session_cache_api needs to implement the size function
    (introduce in OTP 19) for session reuse to be optimally
    utilized.
  * os_mon: memsup now returns the correct amount of system memory
    on macOS.
  * os_mon: Fix memsup:get_os_wordsize/0 to return the current size
    on aarch64.
  * ssh: Fixed a bug when a message to ssh-agent was divided into
    separate packets.
  * ssh: Fix a bug that could crash the cli server if a too large
    cli-window was requested from the client.
  * ssh: Increased test coverage.
  * ssh: A chapter about hardening the OTP SSH is added to the
    User's Guide.
  * ssh: The internal Diffie-Hellman high level API for key
    generation was slow in old and by OpenSSL now unsupported
    cryptolib versions (1.0.1 and earlier). If such a cryptolib is
    used anyhow, the low-level API is used internally in the crypto
    application.
  * ssh: A new timeout is defined for daemons: hello_timeout. The
    timeout is supposed to be used as a simple DoS attack
    protection. It closes an incoming TCP-connection if no valid
    first SSH message is received from the client within the
    timeout limit after the TCP initial connection setup. The
    initial value is 30s by compatibility reasons, but could be
    lowered if needed, for example in the code or in a config file.
  * inets: Clarify the handling of percent encoded characters in
    http client.
  * inets: fix crash for undefined port in uri.
  * inets: Avoid timing issue when setting active once on a socket
    that is being closed by the peer.
  * inets: Handle message body of response with 1XX status code as
    next http message.
  * inets: Fix a crash in http server when setopts is called on a
    socket closed by the peer.
  * inets: A vulnerability in the httpd module (inets application)
    regarding directory traversal that was introduced in OTP 22.3.1
    and corrected in OTP 22.3.4.6. It was also introduced in OTP
    23.0 and corrected in OTP 23.1 The vulnerability is registered
    as CVE-2020-25623 (boo#1177354) The vulnerability is only exposed
    if the http server (httpd) in the inets application is used. The
    vulnerability makes it possible to read arbitrary files which
    the Erlang system has read access to with for example a
    specially prepared http request.
  * inets: Add support of PATCH method in mod_esi.
  * compiler: If the update of a map with the 'Map#{Key := Value}'
    syntax failed, the line number in the stack backtrace could be
    incorrect.
  * compiler: Fixed a performance bug that slowed down compilation
    of modules with deeply nested terms.
  * compiler: The compiler could in rare circumstances do an an
    unsafe optimization that would result in a matching of a nested
    map pattern would fail to match.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in the validator that caused it to reject
    valid code.
  * public_key: Fixed an insignificant whitespace issue when
    decoding PEM file.
  * public_key: Experimental OCSP client support.
  * public_key: Use user returned path validation error for
    selfsigned cert. It allows users of the ssl application to
    customize the generated TLS alert, within the range of defined
    alerts.
  * public_key: add API function to retrieve the subject-ID of an
    X509 certificate
  * runtime_tools: Fixed a crash in appmon_info triggered by trying
    to read port info from a port that was in the process of
    terminating. appmon_info is used by observer to get information
    from the observed node.
  * megaco: The expected number of warnings when (yecc) generating
    v2 and v3 (text) parser's was incorrect.
  * hipe: Fixed a warning issued when building the hipe
    application.
  * odbc: Changes in order to build on the Haiku operating system.
    Thanks to Calvin Buckley
  * crypto: Fix type spec bug in crypto for crypto_init and
    crypto:one_time
  * crypto: The deprecation message for crypto:rand_uniform/2
    indicated a non-existent function. The correct one
    (rand:uniform/1) is now suggested.
  * crypto: Implemented a workaround to allow fallback from using
    the EVP API for Diffie-Hellman key generation
  * crypto: The internal Diffie-Hellman high level API for key
    generation was slow in old and by OpenSSL now unsupported
    cryptolib versions (1.0.1 and earlier). If such a cryptolib is
    used anyhow, the low-level API is used internally in the crypto
    application.
  * sasl: Make release_handler more resilient against exiting
    processes during upgrade.
- Changes for 23.0.4:
  * stdlib: When a temporary child of a simple_one_for_one
    supervisor died, the internal state of the supervisor would be
    corrupted in a way that would cause the supervisor to retain
    the start arguments for subsequent children started by the
    supervisor, causing unnecessary growth of the supervisor's
    heap. There state corruption could potentially cause other
    problems as well.
  * erts: The ERTS internal I/O poll implementation could get into
    an inconsistent state causing input events to be ignored.
  * megaco: The v2 and v3 parsers could not properly decode some
    IPv6 addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 10:20:01 UTC 2020 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- Changes for 23.0.3:
  * erts: Fixed bug in erlang:load_nif/2 that could cause it to
    throw badarg exception if a concurrent code change operation
    was in progress. Bug existed since OTP 23.0.
  * erts: Minor fix of debug compiled VM.
  * erts: An unintentional reuse of an already used emulator
    internal event object could cause a wakeup signal to a thread
    to be lost. In worst case this could cause the runtime system
    to hang. This hang was however quite rare.
  * erts: NIF threads and driver threads on non-Linux systems
    leaked internal resources when terminating. On Windows these
    resources were one event per thread. On most other systems one
    mutex and one condition variable per thread. On these other
    systems that also lacked pthread_cond_timedwait() also a pipe
    with its file descriptors was leaked.
  * compiler: When calls to is_map_key were repeated, the compiler
    could terminate with an internal consistency failure.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in the type inference pass that could
    cause the compiler to hang.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 07:24:09 UTC 2020 - Matwey Kornilov <matwey.kornilov@gmail.com>

- Changes for 23.0.2:
  * erts: Fixed bug when sending an export fun (eg lists:reverse/1)
    on a not yet established connection. It could cause VM crash.
    Bug exists since OTP 23.0.
  * megaco: The mini parser could not properly decode some IPv6
    addresses.
- Changes for 23.0.1:
  * erts: The functionality utilized by BIFs for temporary
    disabling of garbage collection while yielding could cause
    system task queues to become inconsistent on a process
    executing such a BIF. Process system tasks are for example
    utilized when purging code, garbage collecting literal data,
    and when issuing an ordinary garbage collection from another
    process. The bug does not trigger frequently. Multiple code
    purges in direct sequence makes it more likely that this bug is
    triggered. In the cases observed, this has resulted in a
    hanging code purge operation.
  * erts: SCTP and UDP recv/2,3 hangs indefinitely if socket is
    closed while recv is called (socket in passive mode).
  * compiler: In rare circumstances, a guard using 'not' could
    evaluate to the wrong boolean value.
  * compiler: A guard expression that referenced a variable bound
    to a boolean expression could evaluate to the wrong value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 12 06:36:45 UTC 2020 - Matwey Kornilov <matwey.kornilov@gmail.com>

- Version 23.0:
- Potential Incompatibilities:
  * SSL:Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed. TLS 1.3 is added
    to the list of default supported versions.
  * erl_interface: Removed the deprecated parts of erl_interface
    (erl_interface.h and essentially all C functions with prefix
    erl_).
  * The deprecated erlang:get_stacktrace/0 BIF now returns an empty
    list instead of a stacktrace. erlang:get_stacktrace/0 is
    scheduled for removal in OTP 24.
- Improvements and new features:
  * ssh: OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of keys
    called openssh-key-v1. This is now supported with the exception
    of handling encrypted keys.
  * Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This
    is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by
    default without need to change the code.
  * SSL: Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS
    1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases
    the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections
    through legacy middleboxes.
  * Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA
    padding in signature verification
  * The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on
    EPMD has been extended.
  * A first EXPERIMENTAL socket backend to gen_tcp and inet has been
    implemented. gen_udp and gen_sctp will follow.
  * Putting {inet_backend, socket} as first option to listen() or
    connect() makes it easy to try this for existing code
  * A new module erpc in kernel which implements an enhanced subset
    of the operations provided by the rpc module. Enhanced in the
    sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned
    value, raised exceptions and other errors. erpc also has better
    performance and scalability than the original rpc implementation.
    This by utilizing the newly introduced spawn_request() BIF. Also
    the rpc module benefits from these improvements by utilizing erpc
    when possible.
  * Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality
    regarding distributed spawn operations.
  * In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now
    allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)
  * When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions
    (EEP-52).
  * ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a
    as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client,
    this corresponds to the options -L and -R.
  * Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability.
    Examples: 123_456_789, 16#1234_ABCD.
  * New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for
    Erlang modules, functions and types.
  * kernel: The module pg with a new implementation of distributed
    named process groups is introduced. The old module pg2 is
    deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 25 08:48:44 UTC 2020 - g.santomaggio@gmail.com

- Changes for 22.3:
  * compiler: A 'receive' with an 'after 0' clause would prevent
    the optimization that can avoid scanning the entire receive
    queue when matching on a newly created reference.
  * compiler: HiPE can again handle modules with catch and try
    constructs.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in bit-syntax optimization that could
    crash the compiler.
  * crypto: Fixed potential memory leaks involving calls to the
    crypto ng_api.
  * common_test: Document incl_apps cover option
  * common_test: The ct_property_test has now a report function for
    results of stateful testing.
  * common_test: Don't hide error reasons from user
  * stdlib: Fix type specification for uri_string:normalize/2 that
    may also return error().
  * stdlib: Improve error handling in uri_string:normalize/2. This
    change fixes a crash when the input URI has faulty percent-
    encoding.
  * stdlib: Fix minor bugs in the Erlang pretty printer (erl_pp).
  * stdlib: Fix the Erlang parser regarding consecutive unary
    operators.
  * stdlib: Let calendar:rfc3339_to_system_time() crash when the
    time offset is missing.
  * stdlib: Implement uri_string:resolve/{2,3} that can be used to
    resolve a URI reference against a base URI.
  * stdlib: In gen_statem it is now possible to change the callback
    module for a running server. See gen_statem's documentation for
    change_callback_module, push_callback_module, and
    pop_callback_module.
  * ssl: Correct handling of TLS record limit in TLS-1.3. The max
    value differs from previous versions. Also the payload data max
    record check was broken, that is record overflow problems could
    occur if user sent large amounts of data.
  * ssl: Correct close handling for DTLS
  * ssl: Fix ssl:getstat/1-2 to also work for DTLS sockets
  * ssl: Correct internal handling och socket active mode to avoid
    reviving TCP data aimed for a downgraded TLS socket.
  * ssl: When using the host name as fallback for SNI (server name
    indication) strip a possible trailing dot that is allowed in a
    host name but not in the SNI. Also if the server receives a SNI
    with a trailing dot send an UNRECOGNIZED_NAME alert.
  * ssl: Immediately remove session entries if handshake is
    abruptly closed at transport level.
  * ssl: Implementation of the key and initialization vector update
    feature, and general hardening of TLS 1.3. There are
    cryptographic limits on the amount of plaintext which can be
    safely encrypted under a given set of keys. This change
    enforces those limits by triggering automatic key updates on
    TLS 1.3 connections.
  * ssl: Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and
    stateless). This allows session resumption using keying
    material from a previous successful handshake.
  * ssl: Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-
    RSA padding in signature verification.
  * megaco: The documented function
    megaco:get_sdp_record_from_PropertGroup/2 was a wrapper for
    megaco_sdp:get_sdp_record_from_PropertGroup/2 but did not
    actually exist. This has now been fixed.
  * megaco: Test suite completely reworked. Add (timestamp) utility
    functions for debugging and testing.
  * erl_interface: Fix link error "multiple definition of
    `ei_default_socket_callbacks'" for gcc version 10 or when built
    with gcc option -fno-common. Error exists since OTP-21.3.
  * asn1: Fix 'DEFAULT' with 'OCTET STRING' and 'SEQUENCE OF
    CHOICE' with extensions.
  * erts: gen_udp:recv(S, N, 0) corrupted the internal state for
    the socket so after receive with {active, once} it always
    returned {error, timeout}, and wasted the received UDP packets.
    This bug has now been fixed. Reported and pinpointed by
    Alexander Petrovsky.
  * erts: The atom esock_atom_user and esock_atom_kernel was never
    actually created. This has now been corrected.
  * erts: Fixed bug in socket module that could potentially lead to
    scheduler deadlocks.
  * erts: Fix bug causing VM crash if down or stop callback of a
    NIF resource is called after the NIF module has been purged.
    The fix will postpone unloading until all such resource objects
    have been garbage collected.
  * erts: Fixed bug in ets:update_counter/4, when called with an
    invalid UpdateOp and a Key that does not exist, causing
    ets:info(T,size) to return incorrect values. Bug exists since
    OTP-19.0.2.
  * erts: Fix potential heap corrupting bugs when a process calls a
    BIF that blocks other normal schedulers and then writes to its
    own heap without the main process lock. A NIF running on a
    dirty scheduler trying to interact with such a process could
    corrupt its heap. The fixed BIFs were related to code loading
    and tracing.
  * erts: Fixed bug in erlang:list_to_ref/1 when called with a
    reference created by a remote note. Function list_to_ref/1 is
    intended for debugging and not to be used in application
    programs. Bug exist since OTP 20.0.
  * erts: The prim_net nif (net/kernel) made use of an undefined
    atom, notsup. This has now been corrected.
  * erts: Corrected the valid range of the erl command line
    argument +SDio <NumberOfDirtyIoSchedulers> from 0..1024 to
    1..1024. +SDio 0 was erroneously allowed which just caused the
    VM to crash on the first dirty I/O job scheduled.
  * erts: Fix a crash when attempting to log faults when loading
    files during early boot.
  * erts: For socket, not all send and receive flags are supported
    on all platforms. In order to (at least) simplify testing, the
    socket:supports/0,1,2,3 functions has been extended with
    send_flags and recv_flags items, which indicates what the
    current platform can manage.
  * erts: Add a "full featured" version of getifaddrs in the net
    module.
  * erts: The options busy_limits_port and busy_limits_msgq have
    been added to the BIF erlang:open_port/2. The busy_limits_port
    option can be used for controlling the busy state of a port
    executing the spawn_driver or the fd_driver. The
    busy_limits_msgq option can be used for controlling the busy
    state of the port message queue.
  * erts: A socket "registry" has been added making it possible to
    list current open sockets.
  * erts: The counters managed by the socket nif has been extended.
    Their "size" has been increased from 32 bit to 64. Two max
    package size (for read and write) has been added. And four
    accept counters has been added.
  * erts: Add gcc option -fno-common to detect accidental name
    clashes of global variables.
  * erts: New dynamic lock checker that verifies locking orders and
    detects potential deadlock bugs in drivers and NIFs. Enabled
    together with the old static lock checker (for ERTS internal
    locks) in emulator started with -emu_type debug or built with
    configuration option --enable-lock-checking.
  * snmp: A simple supervision of the snmp manager net-if process
    has been added. Also, a way to forcibly restart the net-if
    process has been added. This could be useful if the net-if
    process hangs for some reason.
  * snmp: Misc documentation corrections
  * mnesia: Fixed a timing issue in uninstall fallback
    functionality.
  * eunit: Backport of PR-2316: Strip control codes from
    eunit_surefire output to avoid generation of invalid xml
  * ssh: Unicode problems for ssh_sftp:write fixed.
  * ssh: Changes to the internal api of the experimental ssh_dbg
    tool.
  * ssh: The new functions ssh:set_sock_opts/2 and
    ssh:get_sock_opts/2 sets and reads option values for the
    underlying TCP stream.
  * hipe: HiPE can again handle modules with catch and try
    constructs.
  * hipe: When the return value for try/catch was ignored, the
    native code compiler could crash.
  * public_key: Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and
    PSS-RSA padding in signature verification.
  * diameter: Add the 'first' tuple to type diameter:peer_filter/0.
    The filter was added in OTP-17.5.6.8 and OTP-18.3, but neither
    release updated the type specification.
  * tools: An Emacs warning due to lacking type in defcustom
    declaration has been fixed.
  * tools: Improve emacs indentation.
  * tools: The cover tool could generate instrumented code for a
    module that would cause warnings to be issued.
  * tools: Fixed generated fprof analysis format to also handle
    data in maps.
  * sasl: A socket "registry" has been added making it possible to
    list current open sockets.
  * kernel: The DNS resolver `inet_res` has been fixed to return
    the last intermediate error when subsequent requests times out.
  * kernel: The prim_net nif (net/kernel) made use of an undefined
    atom, notsup. This has now been corrected.
  * kernel: Fix a crash when attempting to log faults when loading
    files during early boot.
  * kernel: Fix crash in logger when logging to a remote node
    during boot.
  * kernel: Improved net_kernel debug functionality.
- Changes for 22.2.8:
  * diameter: The possibility of choosing a handler process for an
    incoming Diameter request with a configured MFA was documented
    in OTP 20.0, but counters (with {traffic_counters, true}) were
    not incremented when this process was on a remote node.
    Counters are now incremented on the node that configures the
    transport in question. Introduced in OTP 21.3.
  * diameter: Transport options differing from those passed to
    diameter:add_transport/2 were used in several situations: when
    starting a transport process after connect_timer expiry after
    an initial connection attempt has failed, when starting a
    transport process after a connection has been accepted, when
    sending events, when returning options in
    diameter:service_info/2, and possibly more. In particular, the
    following configuration options to diameter:add_transport/2
    were dropped: avp_dictionaries, incoming_maxlen, spawn_opt,
    strict_mbit. Moreover, any service options mistakenly passed to
    diameter:add_transport/2 were interpreted as such, instead of
    being ignored as the documentation states, with the consequence
    that outgoing and incoming requests saw different values of
    some options, some were always taken from transport options,
    and others from service options. diameter:add_transport/2 must
    be called in new code for the fix to have effect. Introduced in
    OTP 20.1.

    valid code that matched the same map key several times.
  * compiler: The compiler could crash when compiling a convoluted
    receive statement.

- Changes for 22.2.6:
  * erts: A process could get into an inconsistent state where it
    was runnable, but never scheduled for execution. This could
    occur when a mix of normal and low priority processes where
    scheduled on the same type of dirty scheduler simultaneously.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  7 09:01:17 UTC 2020 - Gabriele Santomaggio <gsantomaggio@suse.de>

- Changes for 22.2.5:
  * erts: A process could end up in a state where it got
    endlessly rescheduled without making any progress. This
    occurred when a system task, such as check of process
    code (part of a code purge), was scheduled on a high
    priority process trying to execute on a dirty
    scheduler.
  * erts: Improved signal handling for processes executing dirty.
    For example, avoid busy wait in dirty signal handler
    process when process is doing garbage collection on
    dirty scheduler.
  * stdlib:  A directory traversal vulnerability has been eliminated
    in erl_tar. erl_tar will now refuse to extract symlinks
    that points outside the targeted extraction directory
    and will return {error,{Path,unsafe_symlink}}. (Thanks
    to Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson for the bug report and for
    suggesting a fix.)

- Changes for 22.2.4:
  * ssl: Enhance error handling, all ALERTS shall be handled
    gracefully and not cause a crash.  
  * ssl: Enhance alert logging, in some places the role
    indication of the alert origin was missing. So the log
    would say undefined instead of client or server.
  * ssl: Two different optimizations did not work together and
    resulted in the possible breakage of connections using
    stream ciphers (that is RC4). Reworked the
    implementation to avoid this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changes for 22.2.3:
  * ssl: Fix the handling of GREASE values sent by web browsers
    when establishing TLS 1.3 connections. This change improves
    handling of GREASE values in various protocol elements sent in
    a TLS 1.3 ClientHello.
  * ssl: Correct DTLS listen emulation, could cause problems with
    opening a new DTLS listen socket for a port previously used by
    a now closed DTLS listen socket.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in the compiler that could cause it to
    reject valid code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 17 08:34:03 UTC 2020 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Changes for 22.2.2:
  * erts: Taking a scheduler offline could cause timers set while
    executing on that scheduler to be delayed until the scheduler
    was put online again. This bug was introduced in ERTS version
    10.0 (OTP 21.0).
  * erts: The ets:update_counter/4 core dumped when given an
    ordered_set with write_concurrency enabled and an invalid
    position. This bug has been fixed.
  * erts: A process calling erlang:system_flag(multi_scheduling,
    block) could end up blocked waiting for the operation to
    complete indefinitely.
  * erts: Duplicate entries for [socket:]getopt and [socket:]setopt
    in man page.
  * stdlib: The ets:update_counter/4 core dumped when given an
    ordered_set with write_concurrency enabled and an invalid
    position. This bug has been fixed.
  * crypto: Constant time comparisons added.
  * ssh: Fixed that ssh_connection:send could allocate a large
    amount of memory if given an iolist() as input data.
  * ssh: Safe atom conversions.
  * ssh: Constant time comparisons added.
- Changes for 22.2.1:
  * erts: Corrected an issue with the new socket api which could
    cause a core dump. A race during socket close could cause a
    core dump (an invalid nif environment free).
  * erts: Corrected an issue with the new socket api which could
    cause a core dump. When multiple accept processes waiting for a
    connect a connect could cause a core dump.
  * snmp: Its now possible to remove selected varbinds (from the
    final message) when sending a notification. This is done by
    setting the 'value' (in the varbind(s) of the varbinds list) to
    '?NOTIFICATION_IGNORE_VB_VALUE'.
  * snmp: Its now possible to specify that an oid shall be
    "truncated" (trailing ".0" to be removed) when sending an
    notification.
  * ssl: Add missing alert handling clause for TLS record handling.
    Could sometimes cause confusing error behaviors of TLS
    connections.
  * ssl: Fix handling of ssl:recv that happens during a
    renegotiation. Using the passive receive function
    ssl:recv/[2,3] during a renegotiation would fail the connection
    with unexpected msg.

- Changes for 22.2
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.2.README
  * Highlights:
  * erts: The Kernel application's User's Guide now contains a 
    Logger Cookbook with common usage patterns.
  * erts: Numerous improvements in the new socket and net modules
  * Standard libraries: common_test: ct_property_test logging is improved
  * Standard libraries: ssl: Correct handling of unordered chains so that it 
    works as expected
  * Tools: Emacs erlang-mode function that lets the user open the documentation 
    for an Erlang/OTP function in an Emacs buffer has been improved. 
    Users will be asked if they want the man pages downloaded if they are not present 
    in the system.

- Changes for 22.1.8
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.1.8.README
  * erts: Large amounts of quickly executed dirty work could
    cause heavy contention on an internal spin lock. The
    spin lock was replaced by a mutex which behaves much
    better under these conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 11 11:22:05 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <gsantomaggio@gmail.com>

- Changes for 22.1.7
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.1.7.README
  * compiler: Fixed a performance bug that caused repeated matches of
    large records to take a very long time to compile. 
  * erts: A literal area could prematurely be released before all
    uses of it had been removed. This occurred either when
    a terminating process had a complex exit reason
    referring to a literal that concurrently was removed,
    or when a terminating process continued executing a
    dirty NIF accessing a literal (via the heap) that
    concurrently was removed.
  * erts:  Fix bug causing VM crash due to memory corruption of
    distribution entry. Probability of crash increases if
    Erlang distribution is frequently disconnected and
    reestablished towards same node names. Bug exists since
    OTP-21.0.
  * erts: Fixed bug causing crash of VM built with configuration
    --enable--sharing-preserving. Provoked when a sent
    message contains both a bit string and the heap binary
    (< 65 bytes) which the bit string was matched from. Bug
    exists since OTP-19.0 but has seen to be easier to
    provoke since OTP-22.1. 

- Changes for 22.1.6
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.1.6.README
  * compiler, erts: The compiler could do an unsafe optimization of
    receives, which would cause a receive to only scan part
    of the message queue.
  * crypto: The AEAD tag was not previously checked on decrypt with
    chacha20_poly1305
  * erts:Fix bug where the receive marker used by the runtime to
    do the receive queue optimization could be incorrectly
    set. The symptom of this would be that a message that
    should match in a receive never matches.
  * snmp: Agent discovery cleanup. If there is no receiver of
    INFORM then #state.reqs in snmpa_net_if keeps on
    growing for DISCOVERY.

- Changes for 22.1.5
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.1.5.README
  * snmp: Application(s): snmp

    The agent discovery process has been made to work with
    snmptrapd..

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 23 14:06:06 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <gsantomaggio@suse.de>

- Changes for 22.1.4
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.1.4.README
  * compiler: Fixed a bug where the compiler could generate incorrect
    code for a 'receive' statement inside a 'try'.
  * crypto:  FIxed a bug if the erlang emulator was linked with a
    very old cryptolib version (1.0.1 or earlier).
    The bug now fixed could have triggered a core dump if
    an unknown cipher name was used in crypto functions.
  * erts: Erlang/OTP can now be built on macOS Catalina (10.15).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 15 16:35:54 UTC 2019 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Changes for 22.1.3:
  * inets: Add HTTP server error logging vi logger
- Changes for 22.1.2:
  * erts: Added the environment variable ERLC_SERVER_ID, which
    allows multiple compile servers to run separately under the
    same user.
- Changes for 22.1.1:
  * erts: A terminating process sending distributed 'EXIT' or
    'DOWN' signals while terminating could end up in a state where
    no progress at all was made. This was triggered by a
    distribution channel that the terminating process was sending
    on got busy. This bug has existed since ERTS version 10.4 (OTP
    22.0).
  * erts: When communicating with a simultaneously exiting port via
    the erlang:port_*() BIFs one could sometimes get stray {Ref,
    What} messages. Where Ref was a reference and What usually were
    the atom badarg.
  * snmp: Made it possible to add 'extra socket options' to the
    (gen_udp) socket open call (for both manager and agent). A new
    option has been added, extra_sock_opts, which makes it possible
    for the user to add a list of extra socket options that will be
    appended to the other socket options for the open call. See the
    snmp application config man page (erl -man 6 snmp) or the
    "Configuring the application" chapter of the Users Guide for
    more info.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in the bit-syntax optimization pass that
    could crash the compiler.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 22 08:21:20 UTC 2019 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Changes for 22.1:
  * kernel: The type specification for gen_sctp:connect/4,5 has
    been corrected.
  * kernel: Extra -mode flags given to erl are ignored with a
    warning.
  * kernel: Fix type spec for seq_trace:set_token/2.
  * kernel: logger:compare_levels/2 would fail with a badarg
    exception if given the values all or none as any of the
    parameters. This is now corrected.
  * kernel: Fix bug where the log file in logger_std_h would not be
    closed when the inode of the file changed. This would in turn
    cause a file descriptor leak when tools like logrotate are
    used.
  * kernel: Fix a race condition in the debugging function
    net_kernel:nodes_info/0.
  * kernel: Fix race condition when closing a file opened in
    compressed or delayed_write mode.
  * kernel: The possibility to send ancillary data, in particular
    the TOS field, has been added to gen_udp:send/4,5.
  * kernel: If the log file was given with relative path, the
    standard logger handler (logger_std_h) would store the file
    name with relative path. If the current directory of the node
    was later changed, a new file would be created relative the new
    current directory, potentially failing with an enoent if the
    new directory did not exist. This is now corrected and
    logger_std_h always stores the log file name as an absolute
    path, calculated from the current directory at the time of the
    handler startup.
  * kernel: Support local sockets with inet:i/0.
  * observer: Fix bug after a user followed link on a pid from an
    expanded term window.
  * observer: Improved dark mode colors on Linux.
  * mnesia: mnesia:add_table_copy/3 could cause a deadlock if
    called when a new node was starting.
  * mnesia: Transactions with sticky locks could with async_asym
    transactions be committed in the wrong order, since asym
    transaction are spawned on the remote nodes. To fix this bug
    the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be
    updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes
    earlier than mnesia-4.14 , OTP-19.0. *** POTENTIAL
    INCOMPATIBILITY ***
  * stdlib: re:run() now yields when validating utf8 in a large
    subject.
  * stdlib: Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version
    8.42 to version 8.43. See
    http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for information about
    changes made to PCRE. This library implements major parts of
    the re regular expressions module.
  * stdlib: The bug with ID ERL-717 has been fixed. The functions
    io:columns() and io:rows() only worked correctly inside
    interactive erlang shells before this fix. These functions
    returned {error,enotsup} before this fix even if stdout and
    stdin were connected to a terminal when they were invoked from
    an escript or a program started with e.g., erl -noshell.
  * stdlib: Fixed handling of ".." and "@" in wildcards. ".." would
    only work when preceded by a literal pattern such as in "a/..",
    not when preceded by wildcard characters such as in "*/..". The
    combination "@/.." was also broken, and in addition "@" in a
    pattern could degrade performance of the wildcard matching.
  * stdlib: Make sure ets:fun2ms() can handle ++/2 in the head of
    functions when called from the shell.
  * stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved.
    Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace.
    Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with
    sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action,
    State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which
    may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New
    features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated
    with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs
    can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more
    readable than using Time = infinity. *** POTENTIAL
    INCOMPATIBILITY ***
  * stdlib: re:run() now avoids validating utf8 in the subject more
    than once in the same call. This validation could previously be
    performed multiple times when the global option was passed.
  * stdlib: ETS ordered_set tables with write_concurrency enabled
    has got a performance issue fixed. There were no limits for the
    values of internal statistics counters before this fix. This
    could result in that the data structure sometimes reacted
    slowly to a change in how many parallel processes were using
    it.
  * stdlib: The ordsets:union/1 is now faster when passed a long
    list of ordsets.
  * stdlib: unicode:characters_to_binary() could return very small
    binaries as reference counted off heap binaries. This could
    cause an unnecessary large memory usage and an unnecessary load
    on the binary allocator. Small binaries are now always returned
    as heap binaries.
  * stdlib: Display a more meaningful error message when a bad I/O
    server is used in a script written in Erlang (escript).
  * stdlib: New feature ets:info(_, binary) to get information
    about all reference counted binaries kept by a table. This is
    the same kind of debug information that process_info(_, binary)
    returns for a process.
  * stdlib: Corrected ETS documentation about the behavior of
    compiled match specifications when serialized through external
    format.
  * tools: cover would fail to start if two processes tried to
    start it at the exact same time.
  * common_test: If a ct hook is installed in the suite/0 function
    in a test suite, then the hook's terminate/1 function would be
    called several times without it's init/2 function being called
    first. This is now corrected.
  * common_test: If init_per_testcase fails, the test itself is
    skipped. According to the documentation, it should be possible
    to change the result to failed in a hook function. The only
    available hook function in this case is post_init_per_testcase,
    but changing the return value there did not affect the test
    case result. This is now corrected.
  * common_test: Add ct_netconfc support for NETCONF 1.1 (RFC
    6241). The 1.1 base capability can be sent in hello, and RFC
    6242 chunk framing is applied when both client and server
    advertise 1.1 support.
  * common_test: Correct lib_dir paths in common_tests opaque data
    structure that is passed to ct_release_test callback modules in
    functions upgrade_init/2, upgrade_upgraded/2 and
    upgrade_downgraded/2. The incorrect paths may cause confusion
    when debugging although it will not cause any incorrect
    behavior on the part of common_test as it is currently not
    used.
  * erts: If you set {linger,{true,0}} on a gen_tcp listen socket,
    accept a connection on that socket, and then close the accepted
    socket, now the linger zero setting is transferred to the
    accepted socket. Before this correction that information was
    lost and the close behaviour on the accepted socket incorrect.
  * erts: Sending ancillary data implemented in OTP-15747
    accidentally left behind test code that caused all UDP sends to
    fail on Windows. This has now been fixed.
  * erts: In the socket nif, used invalid flags when if-def'ing for
    supported TCP flags: TCP_MAXSEG and TCP_NODELAY (the support
    function).
  * erts: Fixed memory leaks in experimental socket module.
  * erts: re:run() now yields when validating utf8 in a large
    subject.
  * erts: Fixed bug in seq_trace:set_token(label,Term) which could
    cause VM crash if Term was heap allocated (not an atom, small
    integer, local pid or port). Bug exists since OTP 21.0 when
    terms other than small integers were first allowed as labels.
  * erts: Extra -mode flags given to erl are ignored with a
    warning.
  * erts: Don't loop indefinitely when --enable-pgo is given to
    configure, but compiler does not support pgo.
  * erts: Fix seq_trace:print/2 not to raise badarg exception if
    label is not a small integer. Bug exists since OTP 21.0.
  * erts: Fixed hipe_flush_icache_range for non-Linux OS on ARM.
  * erts: The fix in OTP-15871 was too conservative and disabled
    the offending load-time optimization in some cases where it was
    safe.
  * erts: Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version 8.42
    to version 8.43. See http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for
    information about changes made to PCRE. This library implements
    major parts of the re regular expressions module.
  * erts: Fix race condition when closing a socket while using
    {active,N} on Windows.
  * erts: Allow more than one -config command line option to erl on
    Windows to conform with other OS.
  * erts: Fix so that ERL_FLAGS environment variable does not
    interfere with command line arguments. Before this fix you
    could write: ERL_FLAGS="10" erl +S and erlang would start as if
    +S had been given the argument 10.
  * erts: The bug with ID ERL-717 has been fixed. The functions
    io:columns() and io:rows() only worked correctly inside
    interactive erlang shells before this fix. These functions
    returned {error,enotsup} before this fix even if stdout and
    stdin were connected to a terminal when they were invoked from
    an escript or a program started with e.g., erl -noshell.
  * erts: Do not use named label in ethread.c inline assemble. This
    allows erts to be compiled using gcc 9.1.0 with LTO enabled.
  * erts: erlang:fun_to_list/1 will now escape the module and
    function name when necessary.
  * erts: process_info(P,binary) would neglect to look through heap
    fragments, potentially missing a few binaries associated with
    the process.
  * erts: HiPE is now automatically disabled on systems with non-
    glibc implementation (for instance musl). This is because musl
    does not provide the API's for guaranteeing that signals are
    delivered on the correct native stack.
  * erts: Fixed bug triggered if a process is killed during call to
    persistent_term:put or persistent_term:erase.
  * erts: Add units to all memory slogans in the crash dump
    documentation.
  * erts: Fix a bug in binary_to_term that would crash the emulator
    if a term larger than 16GB was to be decoded.
  * erts: Fixed bug related to an exiting process sending EXIT and
    DOWN signals to remote linked/monitored processes. Bugs exists
    since OTP 22.0.
  * erts: erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid
    starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a
    multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.
  * erts: The possibility to send ancillary data, in particular the
    TOS field, has been added to gen_udp:send/4,5.
  * erts: The net module has been split into 'net' (kernel) and
    prim_net (preloaded).
  * erts: Socket counters now works as expected and can also be
    extracted with the (new) info function.
  * erts: re:run() now avoids validating utf8 in the subject more
    than once in the same call. This validation could previously be
    performed multiple times when the global option was passed.
  * erts: The un-documented function erlang:dist_get_stat/1 now
    returns the real value of what the distribution queue contains
    instead of a boolean.
  * erts: ETS ordered_set tables with write_concurrency enabled has
    got a performance issue fixed. There were no limits for the
    values of internal statistics counters before this fix. This
    could result in that the data structure sometimes reacted
    slowly to a change in how many parallel processes were using
    it.
  * erts: Optimize the reception of large distribution messages.
  * erts: Binary matching and functions like split_binary/2 will
    now create heap binaries when the results are small enough,
    reducing the chances of small sub-binaries keeping large
    binaries alive.
  * erts: Fixed rare emulator crash in instrument:allocations/0-1.
  * erts: Ports could pass very small binaries as reference counted
    off heap binaries to processes. This could cause an unnecessary
    large memory usage and an unnecessary load on the binary
    allocator. Small binaries are now always passed as heap
    binaries to processes.
  * erts: unicode:characters_to_binary() could return very small
    binaries as reference counted off heap binaries. This could
    cause an unnecessary large memory usage and an unnecessary load
    on the binary allocator. Small binaries are now always returned
    as heap binaries.
  * erts: Improved erl_nif documentation regarding on_load and
    Erlang stub/fallback functions.
  * erts: New feature ets:info(_, binary) to get information about
    all reference counted binaries kept by a table. This is the
    same kind of debug information that process_info(_, binary)
    returns for a process.
  * erl_docgen: Update the documentation build support to handle
    FOP 2.1 .
  * ftp: A possibly infinite loop when receiving messages divided
    in parts is removed.
  * dialyzer: Allow native compilation when using Dialyzer from
    Erlang. The options native (defaults to false) and native_cache
    have been added.
  * eunit: Handle get_until request with explicit encoding in the
    implementation of the I/O protocol.
  * snmp: Fix various minor issues related to Dialyzer. Mostly
    these are dialyzer warnings, but there was also some minor bugs
    detected by Dialyzer.
  * snmp: Fixed a dets usage problem detected by dialyzer.
  * snmp: The function snmp:print_version_info() prints various
    version info. For each module a number of items are printed,
    such as app vsn and md5 digest. And an attempt was also made to
    print "compile time". This used to be available in the
    module_info for each module, but has now been removed.
  * snmp: The use of the deprecated random module has been replaced
    the with rand module.
  * snmp: Removed use of the deprecated function
    erlang:get_stacktrace(). Instead make use of the 'catch
    Class:Error:Stacktrace' feature.
  * syntax_tools: Add missing calls to erl_syntax:unwrap/1. The
    nodes concerned represent names and values of maps and map
    types.
  * wx: Fix a driver bug that could crashes when allocating memory.
  * erl_interface: Fix bugs in ei_print_term for binaries and bit
    strings causing incorrect output.
  * erl_interface: Fixed bug in ei_decode_fun for very old fun
    encoding format. Bug exist since OTP 22.0.
  * erl_interface: ei_print_term() now supports printing of maps
    and funs.
  * xmerl: xmerl_sax_parser crashed during charset detection when
    the xml declarations attribute values was missing the closing
    quotation (' or ").
  * ssl: Handling of zero size fragments in TLS could cause an
    infinite loop. This has now been corrected.
  * ssl: DTLS record check needs to consider that a resent hello
    message can have a different version than the negotiated.
  * ssl: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For
    more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the
    User's Guide.
  * ssl: Correct solution for retaining tcp flow control OTP-15802
    (ERL-934) as to not break ssl:recv as reported in (ERL-938)
  * ssl: Enhance dialyzer specs to reflect implementation better
    and avoid dialyzer warnings for the user that wants to use TLS
    with unix domain sockets.
  * ssl: Add support for ECDSA signature algorithms in TLS 1.3.
  * ssl: Correct error handling of TLS downgrade, possible return
    values form ssl:close/2 when downgrading is {ok, Port} or
    {error, Reason}, it could happen that only ok was returned
    instead of {error, closed} when downgrade failed due to that
    the peer closed the TCP connection.
  * os_mon: Fix disk_sup to ignore squashfs on Linux when
    determining if a mounted filesystem is full or not.
  * os_mon: Fix bug where cpu_sup:util() always returned 100% on
    systems not using gnu libc, for example Alpine OS.
  * ssh: Fixed wrong type definition for the daemon option
    subsystems.
  * ssh: Fixed a possible SSH logging crash if there was a problem
    in an early stage of session setup.
  * ssh: The documentation for the modules ssh_connection, ssh_sftp
    and ssh_sftpd are now generated from the -spec:s.
  * ssh: Internal cleanup including removal of the internal file
    ssh_userauth.hrl.
  * ssh: Removed unused definitions in ssh.hrl.
  * ssh: Removed unused fields in the internal #connection{}
    record.
  * ssh: To get information of a connection_ref() from for example
    ssh:connect/3, there was previously one function available
    namely ssh:connection_info/2. This ticket adds
    ssh:connection_info/1 which returns all information. For
    daemons (servers) started with for example ssh:daemon/2 the
    function ssh:daemon_info/1 returning all information was
    available. This ticket adds ssh:daemon_info/2 which returns
    only the information specified in the second argument. The info
    of connections and of daemons now also includes the item
    'options'. Only those options that does not have their default
    values are returned. For a connection also the items
    'algorithms' and 'channels' are added.
  * inets: httpd - Accept singel LF as line terminator
  * inets: mod_esi will now always propagate the actual HTTP status
    code that it answered with, to later mod-modules, and not in
    some cases hardcode 200.
  * compiler: Code such as the following would crash the compiler
    in OTP 22: [some_atom = fun some_function/1]
  * compiler: Compilation could get really slow (in the order of
    minutes instead of seconds) when compiling huge functions.
    (Thanks to Kostis Sagonas for reporting this bug.)
  * compiler: Fixed a bug in the validator that could reject valid
    code.
  * compiler: In rare circumstances, when two clauses had identical
    bodies and guard tests that tested a single boolean variable,
    the guard test for the second clause could be discarded,
    executing the second clause unconditionally if the first clause
    was not executed.
  * compiler: Fixed extremely slow compilation for huge functions
    doing predominantly pattern matching.
  * compiler: The compiler could generate unsafe code (that would
    crash the runtime system) for map pattern matching. The code
    could be unsafe if the matched key was not present in the map
    at runtime.
  * compiler: Correct code using try/after could fail to compile
    when using the option 'no_type_opt'.
  * compiler: The compiler could crash when compiling code that
    called 'length/1' on a binary extracted using the binary
    syntax.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug where the compiler could fail with an
    internal consistency failure error when compiling receive
    statements.
  * compiler: Fixed a problem where the compiler would crash when
    compiling binary matching in a function head.
  * public_key: Support Password based encryption with AES
  * public_key: Change dialyzer spec to avoid confusion
  * runtime_tools: Fix dbg:stop_clear/0 to also clear trace events
    (send and 'receive').
  * megaco: Fix various minor issues related to Dialyzer. Mostly
    these are dialyzer warnings, but there was also some minor bugs
    detected by Dialyzer.
  * crypto: The implementation of crypto_one_time/4 is adjusted to
    match the type specification. The spec and the black-box
    behaviour of the function are unchanged. Some details: Both the
    spec and the implementation were correct seen separately. But
    with both of them combined simultaneously with
    crypto_one_time/5 which was called by the implementation of
    crypto_one_time/4, an (obvious) error was detected by a
    Dialyzer with more thorough checking than usual.
  * crypto: When using crypto with FIPS mode enabled, the digests
    were not correctly handled.
  * crypto: A memory leak in error handling code in
    ng_crypto_init_nif is fixed.
  * crypto: Fixed the broken static build of the crypto nifs
  * crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and
    Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto
    API. See the manual for CRYPTO.
  * sasl: The net module has been split into 'net' (kernel) and
    prim_net (preloaded).
  * jinterface: Replaced deprecated <tt> with <code> in
    documentation.

- Add patch 0001-erts-Do-not-use-named-no_cpuid-label-in-asm.patch:
  fix boo#1142913

- Changes for 22.0.7:
  * compiler: Fixed a compiler crash introduced in 22.0.6
    (OTP-15952).
- Changes for 22.0.6:
  * compiler: Fixed an unsafe optimization when matching
    tuple_size/1 outside of guards, which could crash the emulator
    if the argument was not a tuple.
  * compiler: Fixed a rare bug that could cause the wrong kind of
    exception to be thrown when a BIF failed in a function that
    matched bitstrings.
  * compiler: Fixed a bug where receive statements inside try/catch
    blocks could return incorrect results.
  * ssl: Enhance error handling for erroneous alerts from the peer.
  * hipe: The HiPE compiler would badly miscompile certain
    try/catch expressions, so it will now refuse to compile modules
    containing try or catch. As a consequence of this, dialyzer
    will no longer compile key modules to native code. ***
    POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
  * dialyzer: The HiPE compiler would badly miscompile certain
    try/catch expressions, so it will now refuse to compile modules
    containing try or catch. As a consequence of this, dialyzer
    will no longer compile key modules to native code. ***

- Changes for 22.0.5:
  * inets: Fix a regression in http client that causes a crash when
    request URI has no scheme.
  * ssl: Fix handling of certificate decoding problems in TLS 1.3
    similarly as in TLS 1.2.
  * ssl: Hibernation now works as expected in all cases, was
    accidently broken by optimization efforts.
  * ssl: Fix interoperability problems with openssl when the TLS
    1.3 server is configured wirh the option signature_algs_cert.
  * dialyzer: Make sure Dialyzer does not crash if the formatting
    of results fails. Instead of crashing, an unformatted version
    of the results is returned.
  * erts: An invalid value test caused the socket:setopt(Socket,
    ip, add_membership, ip_mreq()) to fail with badarg. The same
    for drop_membership.
  * erts: Fixed bug causing VM crash when doing textual dump of a
    process containing an unhandled monitor down signal. Textual
    process dumps can be done with erlang:system_info(procs), trace
    feature process_dump, Erlang shell break menu and a crashdump.
    Bug exist since OTP 21.0.
  * erts: lists:subtract/2 would produce incorrect results for some
    inputs on 64-bit platforms.
  * erts: Fixed a bug in the loader that was similar to OTP-15938,
    yielding incorrect code for some inputs on 64-bit platforms.
  * erts: Fixed bug causing scheduler threads in rare cases to
    block spinnning indefinitely. Bug exists since OTP 21.0.

Tue Jun 25 10:23:44 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- Version 22.0.4:
  * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-22.0.4.README
  - Bug Fixes
  * erts: Fixed a buffer overflow when binary_to_existing_atom/2
    and list_to_existing_atom/2 was used with the latin1
    encoding.
  * erts: The runtime system disconnected a connection if it
    received an exit/2 signal where the recipient was a
    process on an old incarnation of the current node. That
    is, the receiving node had the same node name, but
    another "creation" number. The signal will now just be
    dropped since the receiving process no longer exists. 
  * kernel: user/user_drv could respond to io requests before they
    had been processed, which could cause data to be
    dropped if the emulator was halted soon after a call to
    io:format/2, such as in an escript.
  * ssl: Correct handshake handling, might cause strange
    symptoms such as ASN.1 certificate decoding issues.
  * ssl: Fix handling of the signature_algorithms_cert extension
    in the ClientHello handshake message.
  * ssl:Handle new ClientHello extensions when handshake is
    paused by the {handshake, hello} ssl option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 16 07:47:56 UTC 2019 - Matwey V. Kornilov <matwey.kornilov@gmail.com>

- Version 22.0:
  - Potential Incompatibilities:
  * gen_* behaviours: If logging of the last N messages through
    sys:log/2,3 is active for the server, this log is included in
    the terminate report.
  * reltool: A new element, Opts, can now be included in a rel
    tuple in the reltool release specific configuration format:
    {rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.
  * All external pids/ports/refs created by erlang:list_to_pid and
    similar functions now compare equal to any other pid/port/ref
    with same number from that node.
  * The old legacy erl_interface library is deprecated as of OTP
    22, and will be removed in OTP 23. This does not apply to the
    ei library.
  * VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP
    23.
  - New Features:
  * Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload
    of large messages into several fragments.
  * ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves
    scalability of ordered_set tables.
  * The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in
    one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it
    yields when called with long lists.
  * A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is
    implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as "close
    as possible" to the OS level socket interface.
  * Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long
    sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given
    term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms,
    such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance
    and readability.
  * The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an
    intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment
    (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more
    optimizations possible.
  * All compiler options that can be given in the source file can
    now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.
  * In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully
    functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for
    binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not
    support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any
    of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler
    will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native
    code.
  * Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating
    counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running
    Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase
    in speed will vary depending on the type of code being
    cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more
    than twice as fast with the new Cover.
  * A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This
    is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp].
    It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also
    provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of
    other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No
    support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage.
    This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.
  * SSL: now uses the new logger API, including log levels and
    verbose debug logging.
  * SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.
  * crypto: The new hash_info/1 and cipher_info/1 functions returns
    maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.
  - The application otp_mibs has been removed from OTP.

Thu May 16 09:47:44 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- Update to 21.3.8.1:
- Changes for 21.3.8.1:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.8.1.README
 * erts: Fixed a buffer overflow when binary_to_existing_atom/2
   and list_to_existing_atom/2 was used with the latin1
   encoding. 
 * ssl: Correct solution for retaining tcp flow control
   OTP-15802 (ERL-934) as to not break ssl:recv as
   reported in (ERL-938)
 * tools: cover would fail to start if two processes tried to
   start it at the exact same time.
- Update to 21.3.8:
- Changes for 21.3.8:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.8.README
 * common_test: The test result when a hook function fails is in
   general the same as if the function that the hook is
   associated with fails. For example, if
   post_init_per_testcase fails the result is that the
   test case is skipped, as is the case when
   init_per_testcase fails.This, however, was earlier not
   true for timetrap timeouts or other error situations
   where the process running the hook function was killed.
   This is now corrected, so the error handling should be
   the same no matter how the hook function fails.
   Related Id(s): ERIERL-334
 * common_test: In some rare cases, when two common_test nodes used the
   same log directory, a timing problem could occur which
   caused common_test to crash because it's log cache file
   was unexpectedly empty. This is now corrected.
   Related Id(s): ERIERL-342
 * common_test: Two new common_test hook functions are introduced:
   post_groups/2, which is called after Suite:groups/0
   post_all/3, which is called after Suite:all/0
   A new term, {testcase,TestCase,RepeatProperties} is now
   also allowed in the return from all/0. This can be used
   for repeating a single test case a specific number of
   times, or until it fails or succeeds once.
 * eldap, public_key, ssl:  Back port of bug fix ERL-893 from OTP-22 and document
   enhancements that will solve dialyzer warnings for
   users of the ssl application.
   This change also affects public_key, eldap (and inet doc).
   Related Id(s): ERL-893, ERL-929, PR-2215
 * erl_interface: erl_interface/ei refused to use node names with an
   alive name (the part of the node name preceding the @
   sign) longer than 63 characters and a host name longer
   than 64 characters. The total amount of characters
   allowed in a node name (alivename@hostname) was thus
   limited to 128 characters. These limits applied both to
   the own node name as well as node names of other nodes.
   Ordinary Erlang nodes limit the node name length to 256
   characters, which meant that you could not communicate
   with certain Erlang nodes due to their node name used.

   erl_interface/ei now allow the total amount of
   characters in a node name to be up to 256 characters.
   These characters may be distributed between alive name
   and host name in whatever way needed. That is, the
   maximum amount of characters in the alive name may be
   254 and the maximum amount of characters in the host
   name may be 254, but in total the node name must not
   exceed 256 characters.
 * erts:  Fixed more bugs in process_info(reductions) causing it
   to sometimes behave non-monotonic. That is, a
   subsequent call toward the same process could return a
   lower reduction value.
   Related Id(s): ERIERL-337, OTP-15709
 * ssl:  Missing check of size of user_data_buffer made internal
   socket behave as an active socket instead of active N.
   This could cause memory problems.
 * eldap, public_key, ssl: Back port of bug fix ERL-893 from OTP-22 and document
   enhancements that will solve dialyzer warnings for
   users of the ssl application.
   This change also affects public_key, eldap (and inet doc).
 * stdlib: A bug in gen_statem has been fixed where the internal
   timeout message could arrive as an info to the callback
   module during high load due to incorrect use of
   asynchronous timer cancel.

- Update to 21.3.7:
- Changes for 21.3.7:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.7.README
 * ssh: When an SSH server receives the very first message on a
   new TCP connection, and that message is not the
   expected one, the 64 first bytes of the received
   message are now dumped in the INFO REPORT that reports
   the Protocol Error.
   This facilitates the debugging of who sends the bad
   message or of detecting a possible port scanning

- Update to 21.3.5:
- Changes for 21.3.5:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.5.README
 * diameter: Fix inadvertently broad monitor that resulted in
   gen_server cast messages to hidden nodes from module
   diameter_dist. 
 * erts: Add missing documentation of new external tags NEW_PID,
   NEW_PORT and NEWER_REFERENCE introduced in OTP 19.
   These new tags are planned to be "activated" in OTP 23
   when distribution capability flag DFLAG_BIG_CREATION
   becomes mandatory. Older nodes (>= 19) are able to
   decode these new tags and send them back to the new
   node. Nodes older than OTP 23 will however never encode
   their own local pids, ports and references using the
   new tags.
 * inets:  Fix the internal handling of the option
   erl_script_timeout in httpd. If explicit
   erl_script_timeout value was supplied in seconds it was
   not correctly converted to millisecond units for
   internal usage.
   This change fixes the handling of erl_script_timeout in
   all possible configuration scenarios.

Mon Apr 15 09:13:44 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- Update to 21.3.4:
- Changes for 21.3.4:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.4.README
 * crypto: Fixed build link error on Windows. Unresolved symbol
   'bcmp'.
 * erl_interface: Fix handling of Makefile dependencies so that parallel
   make works properly.
 * erts: Fix erlang:open_port/2 with the fd option to correctly
   cleanup the pollset when the port is closed. Before
   this fix there would be error printouts sent to logger
   when the same fd was reused in a new port.
 * ssh: The callback ssh_channel:init/1 was missing in OTP-21
 * ssh: If a client was connected to an server on an already
   open socket, the callback fun(PeerName,FingerPrint) in
   the accept_callback option passed the local name in the
   argument PeerName instead of the remote name.
 * common_test: OTP internal test improvements.

- Update to 21.3.2:
- Changes for 21.3.2:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.2.README
 * erts: If a suspend/resume signal pair was sent to a process
   while it was executing dirty, the receiving process
   could later end up in a suspended state indefinitely.
   This bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.0 (OTP
   21.0).
 * etrs: Fix a possible deadlock when terminating the ERTS
   caused by a dirty scheduler not releasing it's
   run-queue lock when terminating.
 * xmerl: Handling of character references in attributes are
   fixed. 
 * xmerl:  Normalization of whitespace characters in attributes
   are fixed so it works when character references are
   used.

- Update to 21.3.1:
- Changes for 21.3.1:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.1.README
 * erl_interface: Fixed two bugs in the erl_call program. A missing
   initialization (introduced in erl_interface-3.11) which
   either caused a crash or failure to connect to or start
   a node, and an incorrectly calculated timeout which
   could cause failure to start an erlang node. These bugs
   only caused failures on some platforms.
 * ssl: The timeout for a passive receive was sometimes not
   cancelled and later caused a server crash. This bug has
   now been corrected.
 * ssl: Add tag for passive message (active N) in cb_info to
   retain transport transparency.  

- Update to 21.3:
- Changes for 21.3:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.3.README
 * Erlang/OTP 21.3 is the third service release for the 21st major release
   with improvements, as well as a few features
 * Highlights
 * Kernel: The standard logger handler, logger_std_h, now has a new internal
   feature for log rotation. For full information see the documentation.
 * SSL:The Reason part of the error return from the functions connect and
   handshake has a better and documented format. This is a potential
   incompatibility. See the documentation.
   Refactoring of state handling has improved the TLS application data
   throughput and reduced CPU overhead
   Code optimizations has reduced CPU load for encryption/decryption,
   especially for Erlang's distribution protocol over TLS
   Now supports active N
 * Erl_interface: Support for plugin of a user supplied socket implementation has been added.
 * OTP:The HTML reference documentation now shows the OTP version where
   modules and functions were first introduced. Versions of OTP older than R13B04 is not shown in the reference
   documentation
 * For a full list of details see:
   http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.3.readme

- Update to 21.2.7:
- Changes for 21.2.7:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.7.README
 * erts, otp: Fixes of install/release phase in build system.
   -- The source tree was modified when
   installing/releasing and/or applying a patch.
   -- Some files were installed with wrong access rights.
   -- If applying a patch (using otp_patch_apply) as
   another user (except root) than the user that built the
   source, the documentation was not properly updated. 
 * erts, kernel: Setting the recbuf size of an inet socket the buffer is
   also automatically increased. Fix a bug where the auto
   adjustment of inet buffer size would be triggered even
   if an explicit inet buffer size had already been set.
 * erts: Reading from UDP using active true or active N mode has
   been optimized when more packets than specified by
   read_packets are available on the socket. 
 * erts, kernel:  Setting the recbuf size of an inet socket the buffer is
   also automatically increased. Fix a bug where the auto
   adjustment of inet buffer size would be triggered even
   if an explicit inet buffer size had already been set.

- Update to 21.2.6:
- Changes for 21.2.6:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.6.README
 * erts: When using the {linger,{true,T}} option;
   gen_tcp:listen/2 used the full linger time before
   returning for example eaddrinuse. This bug has now been
   corrected.
 * stdlib: Optimize pretty printing of terms. The slower behaviour
   was introduced in Erlang/OTP 20.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  5 10:43:37 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- Update to 21.2.5:
- Changes for 21.2.5:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.5.README
 * inets: Fixed bug that causes a crash in http client when using
   hostnames (e.g. localhost) with the the option
   ipv6_host_with_brackets set to true.
   This change also fixes a regression: httpc:request
   fails with connection error (nxdomain) if option
   ipv6_host_with_brackets set to true and host component
   of the URI is an IPv6 address.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 25 15:26:37 UTC 2019 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- update to 21.2.4:
- Changes for 21.2.4:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.4.README
 * erts: Fix bug where doing a gen_tcp:send on a socket with
   delay_send set to true could cause a segfault if the
   other side closes the connection.
   Bug was introduced in erts-10.2 (OTP-21.2).
 * erts: Fix a race condition when a port program closes that
   could result in the next started port to hang during
   startup.
   Bug was introduced in erts-10.0 (OTP-21.0).
 * erts: Fix a bug where polling for external events could be
   delayed for a very long time if all active schedulers
   were 100% loaded.
   Bug was introduced in erts-10.2 (OTP-21.2).
 * inets: Make sure ipv6 addresses with brackets in URIs are
   converted correctly before passing to lower level
   functions like gen_tcp and ssl functions. Could cause
   connection to fail.
- update to 21.2.3:
- Changes for 21.2.3:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.3.README
 * compiler: An optimization that avoided allocation of a stack
   frame for some case expressions was introduced in OTP
   21. (ERL-504/OTP-14808) It turns out that in rare
   circumstances, this optimization is not safe.
   Therefore, this optimization has been disabled.
 * erts: Fixed a crash when dangling files were closed after
   init:restart/0.
 * erts: A bug that could cause dirty schedulers to become
   unresponsive has been fixed.
 * ssl: Fix encoding of the SRP extension length field in ssl.
   The old encoding of the SRP extension length could
   cause interoperability problems with third party SSL
   implementations when SRP was used.
 * ssl: Guarantee active once data delivery, handling TCP
   stream properly.
   Correct gen_statem returns for some error cases
 * xmerl: The charset detection parsing crash in some cases when
   the XML directive is not syntactic correct.

Mon Dec 31 17:59:37 UTC 2018 - Gabriele Santomaggio <g.santomaggio@gmail.com>

- update to 21.2.2:
- Changes for 21.2.2:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.2.README
 * ssh: Fixed port leakage if a ssh:daemon call failed.
- update to 21.2.1:
- Changes for 21.2.1:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.1.README
 * erts: Fixed bug on big endian architectures when changing
   file permissions or ownership with file:change_mode,
   change_owner, change_group or write_file_info. Bug
   exists since OTP-21.0.
 * erts: Fixed bug in operator band of two negative operands
   causing erroneous result if the absolute value of one
   of the operands have the lowest N*W bits as zero and
   the other absolute value is not larger than N*W bits. N
   is an integer of 1 or larger and W is 32 or 64
   depending on word size. 
 * ssl:  Fixed renegotiation bug. Client did not handle server
   initiated renegotiation correctly after rewrite to two
   connection processes, due to ERL-622 commit
   d87ac1c55188f5ba5cdf72384125d94d42118c18. This could
   manifest it self as a " bad_record_mac" alert.
   Also included are some optimizations
- update to 21.2:
- Changes for 21.2:
 * http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.2.README
 * HIGHLIGHTS
 * erts, sasl: New counters and atomics modules supplies access to
   highly efficient operations on mutable fixed word sized
   variables.
 * erts: There is a new module persistent_term that implements a
   term storage suitable for terms that are frequently
   used but never or infrequently updated. Lookups are
   done in constant time without copying the terms.
 * ssh: Requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher as cryptolib under the
   OTP application crypto.
 * ssl: *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
   ssl now uses active n internally to boost performance.
   Old active once behavior can be restored by setting
   application variable see manual page for ssl
   application (man 6).
 * erts: Add a new pollset that is made to handle sockets that
   use {active, true} or {active, N}. The new pollset will
   not be polled by a pollthread, but instead polled by a
   normal scheduler.
   This change was made because of the overhead associated
   with constantly having to re-apply the ONESHOT
   mechanism on fds that all input events were
   interesting.
   The new pollset is only active on platforms that
   support concurrent kernel poll updates, i.e. Linux and
   BSD.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITIES:
   kernel: A new function, logger:update_handler_config/3 is
   added, and the handler callback changing_config now has
   a new argument, SetOrUpdate, which indicates if the
   configuration change comes from set_handler_config/2,3    
   or update_handler_config/2,3.
   This allows the handler to consistently merge the new
   configuration with the old (if the change comes from
   update_handler_config/2,3) or with the default (if the
   change comes from set_handler_config/2,3).
   The built-in handlers logger_std_h and
   logger_disk_log_h are updated accordingly. A bug which
   could cause inconsistency between the handlers'
   internal state and the stored configuration is also
   corrected.
 * ssl: ssl now uses active n internally to boost performance.
   Old active once behavior can be restored by setting
   application variable see manual page for ssl
   application (man 6).

- update to 21.1.1:
- Changes for 21.1.1:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.1.1.README
 * erts: Fixed a memory leak on errors when reading files.
 * ssl:  From ssl-9.0.2. CLOSE ALERTS could under some
   circumstances be encoded using an incorrect cipher
   state. This would cause the peer to regard them as
   unknown messages.
 * ssl: Correct handling of socket packet option with new TLS
   sender process, from ssl-9.0.2. When changing the
   socket option {packet, 1|2|3|4} with ssl:setopts/2 the
   option must internally be propagated to the sender
   process as well as the reader process as this
   particular option also affects the data to be sent.
 * eldap: A race condition at close could cause the eldap client
   to exit with a badarg message as cause.
- Changes for 21.1:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.1.README
 * ssh: The key exchange methods
   'curve25519-sha256@libssh.org', 'curve25519-sha256' and
   'curve448-sha512' are implemented. The last two are
   defined in
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-curves
   They all depends on that OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher is
   used as cryptolib.
 * crypto: The typing in the CRYPTO and PUBLIC_KEY applications
   are reworked and a few mistakes are corrected.
   The documentation is now generated from the typing and
   some clarifications are made.
   A new chapter on Algorithm Details such as key sizes
   and availability is added to the CRYPTO User's Guide.
 * erts: The socket options recvtos, recvttl, recvtclass and
   pktoptions have been implemented in the socket modules.
   See the documentation for the gen_tcp, gen_udp and inet
   modules. Note that support for these in the runtime
   system is platform dependent. Especially for pktoptions
   which is very Linux specific and obsoleted by the RFCs
   that defined it.
 * ssh: The cipher 'chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com' is now
   supported if OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher is used as
   cryptolib.
- Changes for 21.0.9:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.9.README
 * compiler: Fix a regression in OTP-15204 that removed .beam file
   metadata that some external build tools relied on.
 * erts: As of ERTS version 10.0 (OTP 21.0) the erl_child_setup
   program, which creates port programs, ignores TERM
   signals. This setting was unintentionally inherited by
   port programs. Handling of TERM signals in port
   programs has now been restored to the default behavior.
   That is, terminate the process.
 * erts: The fix made for OTP-15279 in erts-10.07 (OTP-21.0.8)
   was not complete. It could cause a new connection
   attempt to be incorrectly aborted in certain cases.
   This fix will amend that flaw.    
- Changes for 21.0.8:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.8.
 * erts: A process could get stuck in an infinite rescheduling
   loop between normal and dirty schedulers. This bug was
   introduced in ERTS version 10.0.
 * erts: Garbage collection of a distribution entry could cause
   an emulator crash if net_kernel had not brought
   previous connection attempts on it down properly.
 * kernel: Fixed bug in net_kernel that could cause an emulator
   crash if certain connection attempts failed. Bug exists
   since kernel-6.0 (OTP-21.0).
- Changes for 21.0.7:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.7.
 * erts: A race between termination of a process and resume of
   the same process via erlang:resume_process/1 could
   cause the VM to crash. This bug was introduced in erts
   version 10.0 (OTP 21.0).
 * erts: When tracing on running, in trace events could be lost
   when a process was rescheduled between a dirty and a
   normal scheduler.
- Changes for 21.0.6:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.6.README
 * crypto: Update the crypto engine functions to handle multiple
   loads of an engine.
 * inets: Change status code for no mod found to handle request
   to 501
 * ssl: Correct cipher suite handling for ECDHE_*, the
   incorrect handling could cause an incorrrect suite to
   be selected and most likly fail the handshake.
- Changes for 21.0.5:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.5.README
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITIES erts:
   Fixed a bug causing some Erlang references to be
   inconsistently ordered. This could for example cause
   failure to look up certain elements with references as
   keys in search data structures. This bug was introduced
   in R13B02.
 * compiler: Fixed an issue where files compiled with the
   +deterministic option differed if they were compiled in
   a different directory but were otherwise identical.
 * crypto: Fixed a node crash in crypto:compute_key(ecdh, ...)
   when passing a wrongly typed Others argument.
 * erts: Fixed a bug which caused an emulator crash when
   enif_send() was called by a NIF that executed on a
   dirty scheduler. The bug was either triggered when the
   NIF called enif_send() without a message environment,
   or when the process executing the NIF was send traced.
- Changes for 21.0.4:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.4.README
 * erts: Fixed a crash when matching directly against a literal
   map using a single key that had been saved on the
   stack.
 * erts: Fix node crash when passing a bad time option to
   file:read_file_info/2.
- Changes for 21.0.3:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.3.README
 * otp: Build support for the erlang/corba repository.
 * erts: Fixed a scheduler bug that caused normal schedulers to
   run dirty code.
 * erts: Fixed a bug in erlang:trace_info/2 which caused the
   emulator to crash when a bad argument was passed. The
   bug was introduced in ERTS version 10.0.
- Changes for 21.0.2:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.2.README
 * compiler: In rare cases involving matching of binary literal
   strings, the compiler could optimize away code that
   should be executed.
 * compiler:There could be an internal consistency check failure
   when compiling code that called map_get(Key, Map) and
   then updated the same map.
 * compiler: In rare circumstances, the compiler could crash in
   beam_jump when compiling a floating point operation.
 * erts: Fixed a rare bug that could cause processes to be
   scheduled after they had been freed
 * erts: Fixed a race condition in the inet driver that could
   cause receive to hang when the emulator was compiled
   with gcc 8.
 * public_key: Fix some of the keylengths in the newly generated moduli
   file in public_key are not universally supported. This
   could cause the SSH key exchange
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha* to fail.
   Those keylengths are now removed.
 * stdlib: Fix a bug that could cause a crash when formatting a
   list of non-characters using the control sequences p or
   P and limiting the output with the option chars_limit.
- Changes for 21.0.1:
 - http://erlang.org/download/OTP-21.0.1.
 * compiler:The compiler could crash when compiling a
   complicated function that used the binary syntax.
- Changes for 21.0:
 - http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.0.readme
 * Erlang/OTP 21 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as incompatibilities.
 * Potential Incompatibilities:
   - All Corba applications are now moved from the OTP repository
   - A new Corba repository will be created https://github.com/erlang
   - New applications ftp and tftp, moved from inets
   - ssl no longer supports 3_DES cipher suites or RSA-key exchange cipher suites by default
   - Erlang:monitor on a primitive node (erl_interface, jinterface, etc) will no longer fail with badarg exception. 
     Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.
 * Highlights:
 * Erts:
   - Enhanced IO scalability
   - Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc
   - compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code
   - Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and "Dirty schedulers" resulting in faster file operations
     non-smp VM removed
   - link and monitor optimized for scalability

Tue Aug 14 18:57:58 UTC 2018 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.3.8.5.
- Changes for 20.3.8.5:
 * erts: Fixed a bug causing some Erlang references to be
   inconsistently ordered. This could for example cause failure
   to look up certain elements with references as keys in search
   data structures. This bug was introduced in R13B02. Thanks to
   Simon Cornish for finding the bug and supplying a fix.
 * compiler: Fixed an issue where files compiled with the
   +deterministic option differed if they were compiled in a
   different directory but were otherwise identical.
 * crypto: Fixed a node crash in crypto:compute_key(ecdh, ...)
   when passing a wrongly typed Others argument.
 * erts: Fixed a bug which caused an emulator crash when
   enif_send() was called by a NIF that executed on a dirty
   scheduler. The bug was either triggered when the NIF called
   enif_send() without a message environment, or when the process
   executing the NIF was send traced.
 * erts: Fixed a bug causing some Erlang references to be
   inconsistently ordered. This could for example cause failure
   to look up certain elements with references as keys in search
   data structures. This bug was introduced in R13B02. Thanks to
   Simon Cornish for finding the bug and supplying a fix.
 * mnesia: When master node is set do not force a load from
   ram_copies replica when there are no available disc_copies,
   since that would load an empty table. Wait until a disk
   replica is available or until user explicitly force_loads the
   table.
 * mnesia: Allow to add replicas even if all other replicas are
   down when the other replicase are not stored on disk.
 * ssl: Correct handling of empty server SNI extension
 * ssl: Correct cipher suite handling for ECDHE_*, the incorrect
   handling could cause an incorrrect suite to be selected and
   most likly fail the handshake.

- Changes for 20.3.8.4:
 * asn1: A bug in ASN.1 BER decoding has been fixed. When
   decoding a recursively enclosed term the length was not
   propagated to that term decoding, so if the length of the
   enclosed term was longer than the enclosing that error was not
   dectected. A hard coded C stack limitation for decoding
   recursive ASN.1 terms has been introduced. This is currently
   set to 8 kWords giving a nesting depth of about 1000 levels.
   Deeper terms can not be decoded, which should not be much of a
   real world limitation.

- Changes for 20.3.8.3:
 * erts: Fixed a race condition in the inet driver that could
   cause receive to hang when the emulator was compiled with gcc8.
 * erts: Fix bug in generation of erl_crash.dump, which could
   cause VM to crash. Bug exist since erts-9.2 (OTP-20.2).
 * ic: Fixed potential buffer overflow bugs in
   oe_ei_encode_long/ulong/longlong/ulonglong functions on 64-bit
   architectures. These functions expect 32 bit integers as the
   IDL type "long" is defined as 32 bits. But there is nothing
   preventing user code from "breaking" the interface and pass
   larger values on 64-bit architectures where the C type "long"
   is 64 bits.
 * inets: Enhance error handling, that is mod_get will return 403
   if a path is a directory and not a file.
 * kernel: Non semantic change in dist_util.erl to silence
   dialyzer warning.
 * ssl: Improve cipher suite handling correcting ECC and TLS-1.2
   requierments. Backport of solution for ERL-641
 * ssl: Option keyfile defaults to certfile and should be trumped
   with key. This failed for engine keys.

- Changes for 20.3.8.2:
 * erl_interface: Make ei_connect and friends also accept state
   ok_simultaneous during handshake, which means the other node
   has initiated a connection setup that will be cancelled in
   favor of this connection.
 * erts: Fixed a rare bug that could cause processes to be
   scheduled after they had been freed.
 * ic: Fixed bug in ic causing potential buffer overrun in
   funtion oe_ei_encode_atom. Bug exists since ic-4.4.4
   (OTP-20.3.4).
 * kernel: Fix some potential buggy behavior in how ticks are
   sent on inter node distribution connections. Tick is now sent
   to c-node even if there are unsent buffered data, as c-nodes
   need ticks in order to send reply ticks. The amount of sent
   data was also calculated wrongly when ticks were suppressed
   due to unsent buffered data.

- Changes for 20.3.8.1:
 * inets: Options added for setting low-level properties on the
   underlying TCP connections. The options are: sock_ctrl,
   sock_data_act and sock_data_pass. See the manual for details.
 * ssh: SFTP clients reported the error reason "" if a non-OTP
   sftp server was killed during a long file transmission. Now
   the signal name (for example "KILL") will be the error reason
   if the server's reason is empty. The documentation also lacked
   type information about this class of errors.
 * ssh: Fix ssh_sftp decode error for sftp protocol version 4
 * syntax_tools: Fix a bug regarding reverting map types.

- Changes for 20.3.8:
 * erts: Fixed bug in ets that could cause VM crash if process A
   terminates after fixating a table and process B deletes the
   table at "the same time". The table fixation could be done
   with ets:safe_fixtable or if process A terminates in the
   middle of a long running select or match call.
 * snmp: The Snmp MIB compiler now allows using a
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION type before defining it.

- Changes for 20.3.7:
 * erl_docgen: Update makefile so db_funcs.xsl is a part of the
   installed application.
 * erts: Fixed bug in enif_binary_to_term which could cause
   memory corruption for immediate terms (atoms, small integers,
   pids, ports, empty lists).
 * erts: Fixed bug in erlang:system_profile/2 that could cause
   superfluous {profile,_,active,_,_} messages for terminating
   processes.
 * inets: The option max_headers operated on the individual
   header length instead of the total length of all headers. Also
   headers with empty keys are now discarded.

- Changes for 20.3.6:
 * crypto: If OPENSSL_NO_EC was set, the compilation of the
   crypto nifs failed.
 * crypto: C-compile errors for LibreSSL 2.7.0 - 2.7.2 fixed
 * ssh: Host key hash erroneously calculated for clients
   following draft-00 of RFC 4419, for example PuTTY
 * ssh: Renegotiation could fail in some states

- Changes for 20.3.5:
 * erts: Fixed a crash in heart:get_cmd/0 when the stored command
   was too long.
 * ssl: Proper handling of clients that choose to send an empty
   answer to a certificate request.

- Changes for 20.3.4:
 * erl_interface: Fix bug in ei_connect functions that may cause
   failure due to insufficient buffer space for gethostbyname_r.
 * erl_interface, ic: Optimize encoding/decoding for pure 7-bit
   ascii atoms.
 * inets: Fix broken options handling in httpc (ERL-441).
 * ssh: An ssh_sftp server (running version 6) could fail if it
   is told to remove a file which in fact is a directory.
 * ssh: Fix rare spurios shutdowns of ssh servers when receiveing
   {'EXIT',_,normal} messages.

- Changes for 20.3.3:
 * sasl: When upgrading with instruction 'restart_new_emulator',
   the generated temporary boot file used 'kernelProcess'
   statements from the old release instead of the new release.
   This is now corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 14 10:51:00 UTC 2018 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.3.2
 * ssl: Added new API functions to facilitate cipher suite handling
 * erts, observer: More crash dump info such as: process binary
   virtual heap stats, full info for process causing out-of-mem
   during GC, more port related info, and dirty scheduler info.
 * inets: Add support for unix domain sockets in the http client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  1 09:08:16 UTC 2018 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.2.2.
- Changes for 20.2.2:
 * mnesia: Removed a quadratic behavior in startup. This change
   implies that backend plugins (if used) must be set when the
   schema is created or via configuration parameters before mnesia
   is started.
 * mnesia: Bad timing could crash mnesia after a checkpoint was
   deactivated and reactivated with the same checkpoint name on
   different tables.
- Changes for 20.2.1:
 * ssh: Fix problem with OpenSSH 7.2 (and later) clients that has
   used sha1 instead of sha2 for rsa-sha-256/512 user's public
   keys.
- Highlighted changes for 20.2:
 * crypto, ssl: The crypto API is extended to use private/public
   keys stored in an Engine for sign/verify or encrypt/decrypt
   operations. The ssl application provides an API to use this new
   engine concept in TLS.
 * ssh: SSH can now fetch the host key from the private keys stored
   in an Engine. See the crypto application for details about
   Engines.
 * ssl: A new command line option -ssl_dist_optfile has been added
   to facilitate specifying the many options needed when using SSL
   as the distribution protocol.
 * stdlib: Improve performance of the new string functionality when
   handling ASCII characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 27 07:46:03 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.1.5:
  * erts: Fixed a regression in zlib:gunzip/1 that prevented it
    from working when the decompressed size was a perfect multiple
    of 16384. This regression was introduced in 20.1.1
  * erts: Fixed a memory corruption bug in enif_inspect_iovec;
    writable binaries stayed writable after entering the iovec.
  * erts: Fixed a crash in enif_inspect_iovec on encountering empty
    binaries.
  * erts: zlib:deflateParams/3 will no longer return buf_error when
    called after zlib:deflate/2 with zlib 1.2.11.
  * inets: Correct the handling of location headers so that the
    status code is not hard coded. This should have been fixed by
    commit 2cc5ba70cbbc6b3ace81a2a0324417c3b65265bb but
    unfortunately was broken during a code refactoring and
    unnoticed due to a faulty placed test case.

- Update to 20.1.4:
  * inets: Fix broken handling of POST requests
  * inets: Make sure ints:stop/2 of the service httpd is
    synchronous
  * inets: Honor status code returned by ESI script and modernize
    "location" header handling.

- Update to 20.1.3:
  * diameter: A fault introduced in diameter 2.1 could cause decode
    errors to be ignored in AVPs following the header of aGrouped
    AVP.
  * erts: Added zlib:set_controlling_process/2 to move a zstream()
    between processes.
  * erts: Fix so that schedulers are bound correctly when the first
    available cpu is not the first detected cpu. e.g. when using
    "taskset -c X..Y" when X is not equal to 0.
  * snmp: The recbuf configuration option was not propagated
    correctly to the socket for the SNMP Manager. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Replace references to /var/adm/fillup-templates with new 
  %_fillupdir macro (boo#1069468)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 19 10:40:11 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 21.1.2:
  * diameter: An inadvertently removed monitor in diameter 2.1
    caused the ets table diameter_reg to leak entries, and caused
    service restart and more to fail.
  * erts: Fixed bug that could cause a VM crash when a corrupt
    message is received on distribution channel from other node.

- Update to 20.1.1:
  * compiler: The compiler could issue an incorrect internal
    consistency failure diagnostic for some complicated bit syntax
    maches.
  * erts: The new zlib module returned a data_error when inflating
    concatenated streams, which was incompatible with the old
    module's behavior of returning the uncompressed data up to the
    end of the first stream.
  * erts: zlib:gunzip/1 will no longer stop at the end of the first
    stream when decompressing concatenated gzip files.
  * ssh: Fixed broken printout
  * ssh: Disable aes_gcm ciphers if peer is OpenSSH 6.2 which is
    known to have trouble with them in some cases.

- Update to 20.1:
  * crypto, public_key: Extend crypto and public_key functions
    sign and verify with: support for RSASSA-PS padding for
    signatures and for saltlength setting X9.31 RSA padding. sha,
    sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 for dss signatures as
    mentioned in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1. ripemd160 to be used for
    rsa signatures. A new tuple in crypto:supports/0 reports
    supported MAC algorithms.
  * diameter: Add service option decode_format to allow incoming
    messages to be decoded into maps instead of records. Decode
    performance has been improved. Add service/transport option
    avp_dictionaries to give better support for dictionaries only
    defining AVPs.
  * erts: Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version
    8.40 to version 8.41.
  * erts, kernel, tools: Profiling with lock counting can now be
    fully toggled at runtime in the lock counting emulator
    (-emu_type lcnt). Everything is enabled by default to match
    the old behavior, but specific categories can be toggled at
    will with minimal runtime overhead when disabled. Refer to the
    documentation on lcnt:rt_mask/1 for details.
  * lcnt:collect and lcnt:clear will no longer block all other
    threads in the runtime system. This makes it possible to run
    the lock counting under heavier load.
  * erts: The zlib module has been refactored and all its
    operations will now yield appropriately, allowing them to be
    used freely in concurrent applications.
  * erts, tools: Add erlang:iolist_to_iovec/1, which converts an
    iolist() to an erlang:iovec(), which is suitable for use with
    enif_inspect_iovec().
  * erts: Add new nif API functions for managing an I/O Queue. The
    added functions are: enif_ioq_create(), enif_ioq_destroy(),
    enif_ioq_enq_binary(), enif_ioq_enqv(), enif_ioq_deq(),
    enif_ioq_peek(), enif_inspect_iovec(), enif_free_iovec()
  * observer/crashdump_viewer: Reading of crash dumps with many
    binaries is optimized. A progress bar is shown when the detail
    view for a process is opened. The cdv script now sets
    ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=0 to avoid generating a new crash dump
    from the node running the Crashdump Viewer.
  * observer: Add system statistics and limits to frontpage in
    observer.
  * public_key, ssl**: Improved error propagation and reports
  * ssh: A new option modify_algorithms is implemented. It enables
    specifying changes on the default algorithms list. See the
    reference manual and the SSH User's Guide chapter "Configuring
    algorithms in SSH".
  * tools/xref: The predefined Xref analysis locals_not_used now
    understands the -on_load() attribute and does not report
    unused functions.
  * tools/fprof: When sampling multiple processes and analyzing
    with totals set to true, the output now sums together all
    caller and callee entries which concerns the same function.
    Previous behaviour was to report each contributing entry
    separately.

- Only Java 1.6 is supported by Erlang since 18.0 release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 14 20:05:23 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.0.5:
  * erts: Fixed bug in binary_to_term and binary_to_atom that could
    cause VM crash. Typically happens when the last character of an
    UTF8 string is in the range 128 to 255, but truncated to only
    one byte. Bug exists in binary_to_term since ERTS version
    5.10.2 (OTP_R16B01) and binary_to_atom since ERTS version 9.0
    (OTP-20.0).
  * inets: http_uri aligned to follow RFC 3986 and not convert "+"
    to space when decoding URIs.
  * inets: Added new option max_client_body_chunk to httpd server
    to allow chunked delivery of PUT and POST data to mod_esi
    callback. Note, new mod_esi callback implementation is
    required. Also correct value provided by server_name
    environment variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 27 14:19:49 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.0.4:
  * dializer: Fix a bug where merging PLT:s could lose info. The
    bug was introduced in Erlang/OTP 20.0.
  * erts: A timer internal bit-field used for storing scheduler id
    was too small. As a result, VM internal timer data structures
    could become inconsistent when using 1024 schedulers on the
    system. Note that systems with less than 1024 schedulers are
    not effected by this bug. This bug was introduced in ERTS
    version 7.0 (OTP 18.0).
  * erts: Automatic cleanup of a BIF timer, when the owner process
    terminated, could race with the timeout of the timer. This
    could cause the VM internal data structures to become
    inconsistent which very likely caused a VM crash. This bug was
    introduced in ERTS version 9.0 (OTP 20.0).

- Update to 20.0.3:
  * asn1: Default values now work in extension for PER, so if you
    give the atom asn1_DEFAULT instead of a value it will become
    the default value.
  * compiler: Fail labels on guard BIFs weren't taken into account
    during an optimization pass, and a bug in the validation pass
    sometimes prevented this from being noticed when a fault
    occurred.
  * erts: Binary append operations did not check for overflow,
    resulting in nonsensical results when huge binaries were
    appended.
  * ssh: All unknown options are sent to the transport handler
    regardless of type.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 20 06:28:17 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.0.2:
 * asn: Fixed compilation error of generated code caused by a
   missing quotation of function names as part of an external call for
   encoding.
 * erts: Added missing release notes for OTP-14491 ("performance
   bug in pre-allocators") which was included in erts-9.0.1 (OTP-20.0.1).
 * erts: Fixed a bug that prevented TCP sockets from being
   closed properly on send timeouts.
 * erts: Fixed bug in operator bxor causing erroneuos result
   when one operand is a big *negative* integer with the lowest N*W bits as
   zero and the other operand not larger than N*W bits. N is an integer of 1
   or larger and W is 32 or 64 depending on word size.
 * kernel: The documentation for the 'quiet' option in
   disk_log:open/1 had an incorrect default value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- erlang-gs application has been depricated

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 17 14:24:49 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 20.0.1:
 * erts: Fixed a bug in gen_tcp:send where it never returned when
   repeatedly called on a remotely closed TCP socket.
 * erts: Fixed segfault that could happen during cleanup of aborted
   erlang:port_command/3 calls. A port_command is aborted if the
   port is closed at the same time as the port_command was issued.
   This bug was introduced in erts-8.0.
 * erts: Fixed implementation of statistics(wall_clock) and
   statistics(runtime) so that values do not unnecessarily wrap due
   to the emulator. Note that the values returned by
   statistics(runtime) may still wrap due to limitations in the
   underlying functionality provided by the operating system.
 * erts: Fix performance bug in pre-allocators that could cause
   them to permanently fall back on normal more expensive memory
   allocation. Pre-allocators are used for quick allocation of
   short lived meta data used by messages and other scheduled
   tasks. Bug exists since OTP_R15B02.
 * runtime_tools: A faulty encoding comment was added when saving
   trace patterns to file. This is now corrected.
 * stdlib: A bug in proc_lib:format() introduced in Erlang/OTP 20.0
   is corrected.
 * stdlib: Fix string:len/1 to be compatible with previous
   versions.
 * stdlib: In OTP-20.0, the behavior of c, make, and ct_make was
   changed so that in some cases the beam files by default would be
   written to the directory where the source files were found. This
   is now changed back to the old behavior so beam files are by
   default written to current directory.

- Update to 20.0.0:
 * Potential Incompatibilities
   * ERTS:
     * The non SMP Erlang VM is deprecated and not built by default
     * Remove deprecated erlang:hash/2
     * erlang:statistics/1 with scheduler_wall_time now also
       includes info about dirty CPU schedulers.
     * The new purge strategy introduced in OTP 19.1 is mandatory
       and slightly incompatible for processes holding funs
     * see erlang:check_process_code/3.
     * The NIF library reload is not supported anymore.
     * Atoms can now contain arbitrary unicode characters which
       means that the DFLAG_UTF8_ATOMS capability in the
       distribution protocol must be supported if an OTP 20 node
       should accept the connection with another node or library.
       Third party libraries which uses the distribution protocol
       need to be updated with this.
   * Asn1: Deprecated module and functions removed (asn1rt,
     asn1ct:encode/3 and decode/3)
   * Ssh: client only option in a call to start a daemon will now fail
 * Highlights
   * Erts:
     * Dirty schedulers enabled and supported on VM with SMP support.
     * support for “dirty” BIFs and “dirty” GC.
     * erlang:garbage_collect/2 for control of minor or major GC
     * Erlang literals are no longer copied when sending messages.
     * Improved performance for large ETS tables, >256 entries
       (except ordered_set)
     * erlang:system_info/1 atom_count and atom_limit
     * Reduced memory pressure by converting sub-binaries to
       heap-binaries during GC
     * enif_select, map an external event to message
     * Improvements of timers internally in the VM resulting in
       reduced memory consumption and more efficient administration
       for timers
   * Compiler:
     * Code generation for complicated guards is improved.
     * Warnings for repeated identical map keys. #{'a'=>1, 'b'=>2,
       'a'=>3} will warn for the repeated key a.
     * By default there is now a warning when export_all is used.
       Can be disabled
     * Pattern matching for maps is optimized
     * New option deterministic to omit path to source + options
       info the BEAM file.
     * Atoms may now contain arbitrary unicode characters.
     * compile:file/2 has an option to include extra chunks in the
       BEAM file.
   * Misc other applications:
     * Significantly updated string module with unicode support and
       many new functions
     * crypto now supports OpenSSL 1.1
     * Unnamed ets tables optimized
     * gen_fsm is deprecated and replaced by gen_statem
     * A new event manager to handle a subset of OS signals in
       Erlang
     * Optimized sets add_element, del_element and union
     * Added rand:jump/0-1
     * When a gen_server crashes, the stacktrace for the client
       will be printed to facilitate debugging.
     * take/2 has been added to dict, orddict, and gb_trees.
     * take_any/2 has been added to gb_trees
     * erl_tar support for long path names and new file formats
     * asn1: the new maps option changes the representation of
       SEQUENCE to be maps instead of records
     * A TLS client will by default call
      public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2 to verify the hostname
     * ssl: DTLS documented in the API, experimental
     * ssh: improving security, removing and adding algorithms
     * New math:fmod/2

Sun Apr 30 08:51:11 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 19.3.2:
 * erts: The +Bi command line argument of erl erroneously caused
   SIGTERM to be ignored by the VM as well as of all its child
   processes. This bug was introduced in erts version 8.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  6 13:14:49 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 19.3.1:
 * crypto: Fix a bug with AES CFB 128 for 192 and 256 bit keys.
   Thanks to kellymclaughlin !
 * erts: Trying to open a directory with file:read_file/1 on Unix
   leaked a file descriptor. This bug has now been fixed.
 * erts: Invoking init:stop/0 via the SIGTERM signal, in a non-SMP
   BEAM, could cause BEAM to terminate with fatal error. This has
   now been fixed and the BEAM will terminate normally when SIGTERM
   is received.
 * inets: Fixed a bug in ftp that made further operations after a
   recv_chunk operation impossible.
 * ssh: ssh:daemon_info/1 crashed if the listening IP was not 'any'
 * ssl: Correct active once emulation, for TLS. Now all data
   received by the connection process will be delivered through
   active once, even when the active once arrives after that the
   gen_tcp socket is closed by the peer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  6 13:14:49 UTC 2017 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Changes since 19.2:
 * crypto, ssh: The implementation of the key exchange algorithms
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha* are optimized, up to a factor
   of 11 for the slowest ( = biggest and safest) group size.
 * dialyzer: The peak memory consumption is reduced. Analyzing
   modules with binary construction with huge strings is now much
   faster.
 * erts: A received SIGTERM signal to beam will generate a 'stop'
   message to the init process and terminate the Erlang VM nicely.
   This is equivalent to calling init:stop/0.
 * kernel: The functions in the file module that take a list of
   paths (e.g. file:path_consult/2) will now continue to search in
   the path if the path contains something that is not a directory.
 * kernel: Two OTP processes that are known to receive many
   messages are rex (used by rpc) and error_logger. Those processes
   will now store unprocessed messages outside the process heap,
   which will potentially decrease the cost of garbage collections.
 * public_key: New function pkix_verify_hostname/2,3 implements
   certificate hostname checking. See the manual and RFC 6125.-
 * public_key, ssh: The ssh host key fingerprint generation now
   also takes a list of algorithms and returns a list of
   corresponding fingerprints. See
   public_key:ssh_hostkey_fingerprint/2 and the option
   silently_accept_hosts in ssh:connect.
 * ssl: Move PEM cache to a dedicated process, to avoid making the
   SSL manager process a bottleneck. This improves scalability of
   TLS connections.
 * stdlib: filename:safe_relative_path/1 to sanitize a relative
   path has been added.

    deleted during backup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 09:38:50 UTC 2016 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 19.2:
  * stdlib: The new behaviour gen_statem has been improved with 3
    new features: the possibility to use old style non-proxy
    timeouts for gen_statem:call/2,3, state entry code, and state
    timeouts. These are backwards compatible. Minor code and
    documentation improvements has been performed including a
    borderline semantics correction of timeout zero handling.
  * ssl: Experimental version of DTLS. It is runnable but not
    complete and cannot be considered reliable for production usage.
    To use DTLS add the option {protocol, dtls} to ssl:connect and
    ssl:listen.
  * ssh: Extended the option silently_accept_hosts for ssh:connect
    to make it possible for the client to check the SSH host key
    fingerprint string. Se the reference manual for SSH.
  * ~40 contributions since the previous service release OTP 19.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 29 09:27:58 UTC 2016 - kruber@zib.de

  * erts: Improved dirty scheduler support. A purge of a module
    will not have to wait for completion of all ongoing dirty
    NIF calls
  * erts: Improved accuracy of timeouts on MacOS X
  * kernel: Add net_kernel:setopts/2 and net_kernel:getopts/2 to
    control options for distribution sockets in runtime
  * asn1: Compiling multiple ASN.1 modules in the same directory
    with parallel make (make -j) should now be safe
  * httpd: support for PUT and DELETE in mod_esi
  * ~30 contributions since 19.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 12 18:20:31 UTC 2016 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

- Update to 19.0.4:

    that timed out in a receive ... after. This bug was introduced
    in ERTS version 7.0.
  * erts: Fixed segfault after writing an erl crash dump. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 26 09:01:32 UTC 2016 - matwey.kornilov@gmail.com

    Change default OS monotonic clock source chosen at build time.
    This in order to improve performance. The behavior will now on
    most systems be that (both OS and Erlang) monotonic time stops
    when the system is suspended. (changeable via the

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 26 11:59:59 UTC 2015 - kruber@zib.de

- update to 18.0:
  * new license: APL 2.0 (Apache Public License)
  * erts: The time functionality has been extended. This includes
          a new API for time, as well as "time warp" modes which
          alters the behavior when system time changes. You are
          strongly encouraged to use the new API instead of the
          old API based on erlang:now/0. erlang:now/0 has been
          deprecated since it is a scalability bottleneck. See
          http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html
  * erts: Beside the API changes and time warp modes a lot of
          scalability and performance improvements regarding time
          management has been made. Examples are:
          + scheduler specific timer wheels,
          + scheduler specific BIF timer management,
          + parallel retrieval of monotonic time and system time
            on OS:es that support it.
  * erts: The previously introduced "eager check I/O" feature is
          now enabled by default.
  * erts/compiler: enhanced support for maps. Big maps new uses a
          HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie) representation internally
          which makes them more efficient. There is now also
          support for variables as map keys.
  * dialyzer: The -dialyzer() attribute can be used for suppressing
          warnings in a module by specifying functions or warning
          options. It can also be used for requesting warnings in
          a module.
  * ssl:  Remove default support for SSL-3.0 and added padding check
          for TLS-1.0 due to the Poodle vulnerability.
  * ssl:  Remove default support for RC4 cipher suites, as they are
          consider too weak.
  * stdlib: Allow maps for supervisor flags and child specs
  * stdlib: New functions in ets:
          + take/2: Works the same as ets:delete/2 but also returns
            the deleted object(s).
          + update_counter/4 with a default object as argument

            large number of locks is reduced significantly.
  * ssh: Option max_sessions added to ssh:daemon/{2,3}.
  * stdlib: Add maps:get/3 to maps module. The function will
            return the supplied default value if the key does not

Thu Sep  6 09:00:14 UTC 2012 - kruber@zib.de

- update to R15B02 release:
 + Highlights:
  * Dialyzer: The type analysis tool Dialyzer is optimized to be
    generally faster. - It can now also run in parallel (default)
    on SMP systems and by this perform the analysis significantly
    faster (Thanks to Stavros Aronis and Kostis Sagonas)
  * The SSL application now has experimental support for the
    TLS 1.1 and 1.2 standards as well (Thanks to Andreas Schultz).
  * CommonTest: It is now possible to sort the generated html
    tables. A Netconf client (ct_netconf) which support basic
    netconf over ssh is added
  * Diameter: Statistics counters related to Diameter messages can
    now be retrieved by calling the diameter:service_info/2 function.
  * Various smaller optimizations in the Erlang VM
  * This release also contains 66 contributions from users outside
    the Ericsson team

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 16 16:15:13 UTC 2012 - kruber@zib.de

- updated to R15B01 release:
 + Highlights from R15B01:
  * Added erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time) to ensure correct
    determination of scheduler utilization. Measuring scheduler
    utilization is strongly preferred over CPU utilization, since
    CPU utilization gives very poor indications of actual
    scheduler/vm usage.
  * Changed ssh implementation to use the public_key application
    for all public key handling. This is also a first step for
    enabling a callback API for supplying public keys and handling
    keys protected with password phrases. Additionally the test
    suites where improved so that they do not copy the users keys
    to test server directories as this is a security liability.
    Also ipv6 and file access issues found in the process has been
    fixed.
  * When an escript ends now all printout to standard output and
    standard error gets out on the terminal. This bug has been
    corrected by changing the behaviour of erlang:halt/0,1, which
    should fix the same problem for other escript-like applications,
    i.e. that data stored in the output port driver buffers got
    lost when printing on a TTY and exiting through erlang:halt/0,1.
    The BIF:s erlang:halt/0,1 has gotten improved semantics and
    there is a new BIF erlang:halt/2 to accomplish something like
    the old semantics. See the documentation.
  * The DTrace source patch from Scott Lystig Fritchie is
    integrated in the source tree. Using an emulator with dtrace
    probe is still not supported for production use, but may be a
    valuable debugging tool. Configure with
    --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace (or --with-dynamic-trace=systemtap)
    to create a build with dtrace probes enabled. See runtime_tools
    for documentation and examples
  * Added Torbjörn Törnkvists LDAP client as a new application
    called eldap.
  * Added options for the ssh client to support user keys files
    that are password protected.

    The application support the diameter protocol specified in
    RFC 3588 and is intended to provide an Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications.
  * The documentation for stdlib and kernel now uses type
    specifications from the source modules which should guarantee
    that the documentation and code are consistent with regard to
    the type information.

  * OTP-8525 It is now possible to use Erlang specifications and
             types in EDoc documentation.

  * OTP-8926 new function inet:getifaddrs/0 modeled after C library
             function getifaddrs() on BSD and Linux
             (replaces inet:getiflist/0 and inet:ifget/2)
