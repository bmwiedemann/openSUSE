  <title>EB is a C Library for Accessing CD-ROM Books</title>
  <description>EB Library is a C library for accessing CD-ROM books.  It can be built
on UNIX-based systems.	EB Library supports accessing CD-ROM books in
EB, EBG, EBXA, EBXA-C, S-EBXA, and EPWING formats.  CD-ROM books in
those formats are popular in Japan.  Because CD-ROM books themselves
are based on the ISO 9660 format, you can mount the CDs in the same way
as other ISO 9660 CDs.</description>
