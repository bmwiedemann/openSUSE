- Update to version 2.3.0:
  * New Features
    - Timezone Selection in {date} Extension
      You can now generate dates and times in any timezone using
      the new tz parameter. For example:

          - trigger: ":today"
            replace: "{{mytime}}"
            vars:
              - name: mytime
                type: date
                params:
                  format: "%H:%M"
                  locale: en-AG
                  tz: America/Los_Angeles

      Choose from the database of IANA timezones such as "UTC",
      "Europe/Paris", "Asia/Tokyo", etc.
    - Configurable Regex Buffer Size
      - Advanced users can now adjust the maximum number of
        characters stored for regex-based triggers. The default
        (previously not editable) is 50. We recommend to set a
        reasonable low number.
      - Add max_regex_buffer_size: <number> to your default.yml
    - Empty Triggers are Safely Ignored
      - will automatically filter out empty triggers in YAML match
        files and log a warning, preventing accidental errors and
        confusion.
    - Support for Both .yml and .yaml Config Files
      - now recognizes configuration files with either extension.
        For compatibility purposes, .yml is still the preferred
        value if the user has a file with both extensions.
      - We would like to switch to prefer yaml in the future
  * Improvements
    - Markdown Rendering Overhaul
      - switched to the pulldown-cmark engine for markdown
        conversion, providing faster, more reliable rendering of
        your markdown snippets.
    - Better Search Results Display
      - Search popups now correctly escape HTML characters in
        labels and triggers, preventing visual glitches and
        accidental HTML interpretation.
    - More Flexible Config Includes
      - The configuration engine can now aggregate both .yml and
        .yaml match files, reducing troubleshooting and making
        structure more flexible.
    - Enhanced CLI Help and Error Handling
      - Improved command-line help: if no subcommand is given,
        espanso now gracefully prints help instructions.
      - Version and help flags work more consistently across
        platforms.
  * Bug Fixes
    - Search results now handle HTML special characters correctly.
    - Enter key (including numpad) works as expected in search.
    - Date extension now gracefully handles invalid formats and
      unsupported timezones.
    - Improved error messages for missing default configuration.
  * Dependencies & CI
    - Added timezone and markdown libraries.
    - Removed deprecated dependencies and scripts.
    - CI workflow improvements.

- Update to version 2.2.5 (2.2.4 was not released):
  Hey everyone! Here is a fresh new release of espanso. It took us
  a long time to figure out the correct release pipeline, but I
  hope from now we will be able to do more timely releases, as the
  CI works fine ðŸ˜„ .
  One note though, I had to change the CI, so now it looks like
  this:

    espanso 2.2.5
    Federico Terzi and the espanso contributors
    A Privacy-first, Cross-platform Text Expander

    USAGE:
        espanso [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

    OPTIONS:
        -h, --help       Print help information
        -v               Sets the level of verbosity
        -V, --version    Print version information

    SUBCOMMANDS:
        cmd           Send a command to the espanso daemon.
        edit          Shortcut to open the default text editor to edit config files
        env-path      Add or remove the 'espanso' command from the PATH
        help          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
        log           Print the daemon logs.
        match         List and execute matches from the CLI
        package       package-management commands
        path          Prints all the espanso directory paths to easily locate configuration and
                          matches.
        service       A collection of commands to manage the Espanso service (for example, enabling
                          auto-start on system boot).
        workaround    A collection of workarounds to solve some common problems.

  Note that status, start, restart, stop and the others are
  missing, but they work as internal aliases. Everything that
  worked before, should work correctly in this release.
  In a future release I'm going to restore the original commands,
  (status, restart, etc), but for internal changes they had to be
  removed for this release.

Have fun expanding!
