- Update to version 2.2.5 (2.2.4 was not released):
  Hey everyone! Here is a fresh new release of espanso. It took us
  a long time to figure out the correct release pipeline, but I
  hope from now we will be able to do more timely releases, as the
  CI works fine ðŸ˜„ .
  One note though, I had to change the CI, so now it looks like
  this:

    espanso 2.2.5
    Federico Terzi and the espanso contributors
    A Privacy-first, Cross-platform Text Expander

    USAGE:
        espanso [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

    OPTIONS:
        -h, --help       Print help information
        -v               Sets the level of verbosity
        -V, --version    Print version information

    SUBCOMMANDS:
        cmd           Send a command to the espanso daemon.
        edit          Shortcut to open the default text editor to edit config files
        env-path      Add or remove the 'espanso' command from the PATH
        help          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
        log           Print the daemon logs.
        match         List and execute matches from the CLI
        package       package-management commands
        path          Prints all the espanso directory paths to easily locate configuration and
                          matches.
        service       A collection of commands to manage the Espanso service (for example, enabling
                          auto-start on system boot).
        workaround    A collection of workarounds to solve some common problems.

  Note that status, start, restart, stop and the others are
  missing, but they work as internal aliases. Everything that
  worked before, should work correctly in this release.
  In a future release I'm going to restore the original commands,
  (status, restart, etc), but for internal changes they had to be
  removed for this release.

Have fun expanding!
