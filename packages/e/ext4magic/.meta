  <title>Linux admin tool, can help to recover deleted or overwritten files on ext3 and ext4 filesystems</title>
  <description>ext4magic is a small tool for Linux administration, it can help to recover accidentally deleted or overwritten files from an ext3 or ext4 file systems. Especially private computers often lack an adequate and reliable backup or the backup interval is too large lack of capacity. After some minor or major accidents console or script often arises the question, how can I just restore the deleted files back? 

Authors comment about version v0.3.0 in Feb 2012

For me, the program and its functions completed tested and stable
up to 16TByte filesystem size. 64Bit file systems are not implemented.


Not tested at the moment:
 - the new library releases form last 2 Weeks libmagic and libext2fs
 - file systems written with new Kernel (only testet written with 2.6 Kernel)
 - BigEndian CPUs not testet very extensively
