  <title>Detects encoding of text files</title>
  <description>Enca is an Extremely Naive Charset Analyser. It detects character set and
encoding of text files and can also convert them to other encodings using
either a built-in converter or external libraries and tools like libiconv,
librecode, or cstocs.

Currently, it has support for Belarussian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech,
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian,
Chinese, and some multibyte encodings (mostly variants of Unicode)
independent on the language.

This package also contains shared Enca library other programs can make use of.

Install Enca if you need to cope with text files of dubious origin
and unknown encoding and convert them to some reasonable encoding.</description>
