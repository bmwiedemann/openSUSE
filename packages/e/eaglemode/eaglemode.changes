Wed Sep 23 06:48:00 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.95
  * Added some interpolation algorithms for the zooming into photos, videos,
  * icons and other images. Now the user can choose (in the preferences) from:
  * Area Sampling, Bilinear, Bicubic, Lanczos, and Adaptive.
  * Accelerated graphics display by making use of the AVX2 CPU extension.
  * Extended the graphics API by a texture class which allows more flexible
  * filling of figures with colors and images.
  * Ported the audio/video player to Windows, based on the VLC library.
  * Switched from Xine to VLC also for other OSes because some tests showed
  that VLC is more crash-resistant against randomly corrupted files and
  thereby most likely more secure.
  * Completely removed support for outdated archive file formats to improve
  security and simplify maintenance: Goodbye to arc, arj, lha, rar, and zoo.
  Minor fixes and improvements.
