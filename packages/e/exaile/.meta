  <description>Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's AmaroK, but
for GTK+.

It incorporates many of the cool things from AmaroK (and other
media players) like automatic fetching of album art, handling of
large libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via the
wikipedia, last.fm support, optional iPod support (assuming you
have python-gpod installed).

In addition, Exaile also includes a built in shoutcast directory
browser, tabbed playlists (so you can have more than one playlist
open at a time), blacklisting of tracks (so they don't get scanned
into your library), downloading of guitar tablature from
fretplay.com, and submitting played tracks on your iPod to last.fm.</description>
