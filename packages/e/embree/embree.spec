%description
Intel Embree is a collection of ray tracing kernels originally developed
at Intel. The target users of Intel Embree are graphics application engineers
who want to improve the performance of their photo-realistic rendering
application by leveraging Embree's ray tracing kernels.

Note:
This version is specifically dedicated to Blender Cycles, as it is using the
build options that are required for it. In order to reduce the risk of
incompatibilities, it is built as static libraries, which is also enforced by
the Blender Cycles build for the time being.
