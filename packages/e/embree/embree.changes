- Use memory limit as the build is dominated by 2 huge gas runs.

- update to version 3.8.0
  + New Features:
    * Added collision detection support for user geometries (see
      rtcCollide API function)
    * Passing geomID to user geometry callbacks.
  + Fixed Issues:
    * Bugfix in AVX512VL codepath for rtcIntersect1
    * For sphere geometries the intersection filter gets now
      invoked for front and back hit.
    * Fixed some bugs for quaternion motion blur.
    * RTCIntersectContext always non-const in Embree API
    * Made RTCHit aligned to 16 bytes in Embree API

- update to version 3.7.0
  + Added quaternion motion blur for correct interpolation of
    rotational transformations.
  + Fixed wrong bounding calculations when a motion blurred
    instance did instantiate a motion blurred scene.
  + In robust mode the depth test consistently uses tnear <= t <=
    tfar now in order to robustly continue traversal at a previous
    hit point in a way that guarentees reaching all hits, even hits
    at the same place.
  + Fixed depth test in robust mode to be precise at tnear and
    tfar.
  + Added next_hit tutorial to demonstrate robustly collecting all
    hits along a ray using multiple ray queries.
  + Implemented robust mode for curves. This has a small
    performance impact but fixes bounding problems with flat
    curves.
  + Improved quality of motion blur BVH by using linear bounds
    during binning.
  + Implemented issue with motion blur builder where number of time
    segments for SAH heuristic were counted wrong due to some
    numerical issues.
  + Fixed an accuracy issue with rendering very short fat curves.
  + rtcCommitScene can now get called during rendering from
    multiple threads to lazily build geometry. When TBB is used
    this causes a much lower overhead than using
    rtcJoinCommitScene.
  + Geometries can now get attached to multiple scenes at the same
    time, which simplifies mapping general scene graphs to API.
  + Updated to TBB 2019.9 for release builds.
  + Fixed a bug in the BVH builder for Grid geometries.
  + Added macOS Catalina support to Embree releases.

Fri Oct 11 18:49:03 UTC 2019 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 3.6.1
   Added Catmull-Rom curve types.
   Added support for multi-level instancing.
   Added support for point queries.
   Fixed a bug preventing normal oriented curves being used unless timesteps were specified.
   Fixed bug in external BVH builder when configured for dynamic build.
   Added support for new config flag "user_threads=N" to device initialization
   which sets the number of threads used by TBB but created by the user.
   Fixed automatic vertex buffer padding when using rtcSetNewGeometry API function.

- Trim marketing from description.

Sun Sep  8 16:14:54 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Relax _constraints, and use memory-constraints/limit_build instead
- Disable building for every arch but x86_64, as embree strictly requires
  at least SSE2.
- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.
- Use tbb-devel BuildRequires instead of cmake(TBB), the latter is not
  available in Leap 15.x
