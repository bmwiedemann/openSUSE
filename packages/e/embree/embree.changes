- update to version 3.12.0
  + Added linear cone curve geometry support. In this mode a real
    geometric surface for curves
  + with linear basis is rendered using capped cones. They are
    discontinuous at edge boundaries.
  + Enabled fast two level builder for instances when low quality
    build is requested.
  + Bugfix for BVH build when geometries got disabled.
  + Added EMBREE_BACKFACE_CULLING_CURVES cmake option. This allows
    for a cheaper round
  + linear curve intersection when correct internal tracking and
    back hits are not required.
  + The new cmake option defaults to OFF.
  + User geometries with invalid bounds with lower>upper in some
    dimension will be ignored.
  + Increased robustness for grid interpolation code and fixed
    returned out of range u/v
  + coordinates for grid primitive.
  + Fixed handling of motion blur time range for sphere, discs, and
    oriented disc geometries.
  + Fixed missing model data in releases.
  + Ensure compatibility to newer versions of oneTBB.
  + Motion blur BVH nodes no longer store NaN values.

Tue Sep  1 16:22:19 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- raise limits to 24G, since this version uses up to 22,6G on TW 
  for build (16,7G on 15.2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 08:33:47 UTC 2020 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Use memory limit as the build is dominated by 2 huge gas runs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 11:07:33 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- update to version 3.11.0
  + Round linear curves now automatically check for the existence
    of left and right
  + connected segments if the flags buffer is empty. Left segments
    exist if the
  + segment(id-1) + 1 == segment(id) and similarly for right
    segments.
  + Implemented the min-width feature for curves and points, which
    allows to increase the
  + radius in a distance dependent way, such that the curve or
    points thickness is n pixels wide.
  + Round linear curves are closed now also at their start.
  + Embree no longer supports Visual Studio 2013 starting with this
    release.
  + Bugfix in subdivision tessellation level assignment for non-
    quad base primitives
  + Small meshes are directly added to top level build phase of
    two-level builder to reduce memory consumption.
  + Enabled fast two level builder for user geometries when low
    quality build is requested.

- update to version 3.10.0
  + Added EMBREE_COMPACT_POLYS CMake option which enables double
    indexed triangle and quad
  + leaves to reduce memory consumption in compact mode by an
    additional 40% at about
  + 15% performance impact. This new mode is disabled by default.
  + Compile fix for oneTBB 2021.1-beta05
  + Releases upgrade to TBB 2020.2
  + Compile fix for ISPC v1.13.0
  + Adding RPATH to libembree.so in releases
  + Increased required CMake version to 3.1.0
  + Made instID member for array of pointers ray stream layout
    optional again.

- update to version 3.9.0
  + Added round linear curve geometry support. In this mode a real
    geometric surface for curves
  + with linear basis is rendered using capped cones with spherical
    filling between
  + the curve segments.
  + Added rtcGetSceneDevice API function, that returns the device a
    scene got created in.
  + Improved performance of round curve rendering by up to 1.8x.
  + Bugfix to sphere intersection filter invokation for back hit.
  + Fixed wrong assertion that triggered for invalid curves which
    anyway get filtered out.
  + RelWithDebInfo mode no longer enables assertions.
  + Fixed an issue in FindTBB.cmake that caused compile error with
    Debug build under Linux.
  + Embree releases no longer provide RPMs for Linux. Please use
    the RPMs coming with the package
  + manager of your Linux distribution.

Wed Feb  5 21:11:16 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- update to version 3.8.0
  + New Features:
    * Added collision detection support for user geometries (see
      rtcCollide API function)
    * Passing geomID to user geometry callbacks.
  + Fixed Issues:
    * Bugfix in AVX512VL codepath for rtcIntersect1
    * For sphere geometries the intersection filter gets now
      invoked for front and back hit.
    * Fixed some bugs for quaternion motion blur.
    * RTCIntersectContext always non-const in Embree API
    * Made RTCHit aligned to 16 bytes in Embree API

- update to version 3.7.0
  + Added quaternion motion blur for correct interpolation of
    rotational transformations.
  + Fixed wrong bounding calculations when a motion blurred
    instance did instantiate a motion blurred scene.
  + In robust mode the depth test consistently uses tnear <= t <=
    tfar now in order to robustly continue traversal at a previous
    hit point in a way that guarentees reaching all hits, even hits
    at the same place.
  + Fixed depth test in robust mode to be precise at tnear and
    tfar.
  + Added next_hit tutorial to demonstrate robustly collecting all
    hits along a ray using multiple ray queries.
  + Implemented robust mode for curves. This has a small
    performance impact but fixes bounding problems with flat
    curves.
  + Improved quality of motion blur BVH by using linear bounds
    during binning.
  + Implemented issue with motion blur builder where number of time
    segments for SAH heuristic were counted wrong due to some
    numerical issues.
  + Fixed an accuracy issue with rendering very short fat curves.
  + rtcCommitScene can now get called during rendering from
    multiple threads to lazily build geometry. When TBB is used
    this causes a much lower overhead than using
    rtcJoinCommitScene.
  + Geometries can now get attached to multiple scenes at the same
    time, which simplifies mapping general scene graphs to API.
  + Updated to TBB 2019.9 for release builds.
  + Fixed a bug in the BVH builder for Grid geometries.
  + Added macOS Catalina support to Embree releases.

Fri Oct 11 18:49:03 UTC 2019 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- update to version 3.6.1
   Added Catmull-Rom curve types.
   Added support for multi-level instancing.
   Added support for point queries.
   Fixed a bug preventing normal oriented curves being used unless timesteps were specified.
   Fixed bug in external BVH builder when configured for dynamic build.
   Added support for new config flag "user_threads=N" to device initialization
   which sets the number of threads used by TBB but created by the user.
   Fixed automatic vertex buffer padding when using rtcSetNewGeometry API function.

Mon Sep  9 17:40:25 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim marketing from description.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  8 16:14:54 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Relax _constraints, and use memory-constraints/limit_build instead
- Disable building for every arch but x86_64, as embree strictly requires
  at least SSE2.
- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.
- Use tbb-devel BuildRequires instead of cmake(TBB), the latter is not
  available in Leap 15.x

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 15 19:54:19 UTC 2019 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>
