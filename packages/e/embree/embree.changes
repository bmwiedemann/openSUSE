- Relax _constraints, and use memory-constraints/limit_build instead
- Disable building for every arch but x86_64, as embree strictly requires
  at least SSE2.
- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.
- Use tbb-devel BuildRequires instead of cmake(TBB), the latter is not
  available in Leap 15.x
