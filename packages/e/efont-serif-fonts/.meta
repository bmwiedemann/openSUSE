  <title>Free and Open Scalable Electronic Font</title>
  <description>The efont-serif is a really free and open scalable electronic font.

The Omega Serif and URW Nimbus are also distributable. But their letter
forms are quite similar to Adobe Times. The efont-serif does not copy
the outlines or the letter forms of any copyrighted typefaces.
