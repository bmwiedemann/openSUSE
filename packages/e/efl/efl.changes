    possible list here, but you will find improved DRM support, a new
    widget for controlling vector animations, a first step towards
    MVVM support, general bugfixes and more.

Thu Feb 14 00:59:15 UTC 2019 - Simon Lees <sflees@suse.de>

- Update to 1.21.1 feature release
  == Wayland, DRM and Input ==
  The wayland protocol implementations still remains a highly active area
  in EFL. This cycle we have
  seen the addition of an EFL specific hints protocol for setting aspect
  on surfaces and the support of
  xdg-shell vfinal. Our drm2 and libinput usage gained support for setting
  pointer acceleration speed.

  == Edje ==
  To aid the, sometimes very hard, debugging of edje files an embryo echo
  command was added.
  It is now also possible to reference images from other edje files. The
  biggest change however is the
  possibility to have edje_cc verify namespace usage during compilation .
  This also has been enabled in
  tree (with the whitelisting of some exceptions we can not change). We
  hope this will help to avoid
  these kind of problems for the future.

  == Evas ==
  The Eavs subsystem added async canvas text layout functionality and
  improvements on font
  handling. A scale feature for embedded bitmap fonts and support for
  different H/V font DPI
  has been aded. Last but not least we added align=end in textblock for
  putting a text at the
  opposite side of LTR/RTL.

  == Elementary ==
  A new text on patch widget was introduced this cycle together with a
  item pin feature in genlist.
  Additionally elm_entry was enhanced with a prediction hints API.

  == Eolian ==
  Eolian improved its parsing in various areas. One being deferred parsing
  of inherits as well
  as better static checks of the given eo files. New API's have been added
  for part
  enumeration and to query information about objects.

What's New

Even if we had only three months a lot has happened during the 1.17 release cycle.
We only cover some highlights here. For the full list please look at the NEWS files
if you are interested in the details. As usual we have been working on fixing bugs,
optimising our code for speed and memory footprint and adding new features.
Wayland / DRM

New APIs for keymap cache and left-handed mouse have been added in
ecore_wayland while a new wayland module helped to fix some bugs with
window sizing problems we have seen.
Evas

The biggest changes in Evas have been adding support for hyphenation
wrap style and the addition of a TBM (Tizen Buffer Management) surface in
the Evas engine.
Eina

Many of the changes in Eina during this release are towards better support of
vector graphics coming in form of our Ector library. They include eina_bezier,
eina_vector, eina_matrix and eina_quaternion updates.
Additonally we added APIs for base64 encode and decode functionality.
Edje

New support for size_class as well as text_class syntax have been added and
we can now embed TGV files directly into an edje file.
Bindings

JavaScript Eolian binding have been added as a first step towards JavaScript
bindings for the EFL.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 19 09:32:43 UTC 2016 - sleep_walker@opensuse.org

- EFL now requires libsystemd >= 209 which is not available on

- Swap back to pkgconfig(luajit) for now, hopefully factory will be fixed soon
   using anything else makes obs happy but still fails configure due to a
   incorrect pc file
- Bump to 1.16.0
    Wayland
    The focus of work on our wayland areas have been stabilisation and filling of gaps for the upcoming E20 release. To make 1.16 a solid base for it work has been gone to make the evas drm engine more solid and adding support for things like adjusting keyboard repeat and rate delay, etc
    Evas GL
    Besides some normal optimisation evas GL got support for the new partial update extension.
    Eina
    To aid debugging and tooling infrastructure eina thread does now support setting thread names and many internal threads are already named.
    Eo (BETA)
    A lot of optimisation, memory as well as CPU time, has been gone into EO this time. Initially we hoped to declare EO stable after this development cycle, but we need to postpone this for at least another cycle as some more optimisation are being planned which might break ABI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 06:17:04 UTC 2015 - simon@simotek.net

- bump to 1.15.0 Feature release
Eo
Cleaned up object creation (constructor and finalizer) and improved
error handling. This includes adding a return value to eo_constructor()
and removing eo_error_set(). Object creation and error handling should
now be more consistent.

Ecore DRM
Several new API functions were added for working with Outputs, along
with improvements to rendering speed and the addition of support for
hardware-accelerated rendering.

Ecore Wayland

Support added for version 5 of the xdg_shell protocol. With many
other enhancement we no depend on version >=1.8.0 of the wayland
libraries (client, cursor and server). Wayland input methods gained
support for autocapital, language and password mode.

Eolian

Several new convenience APIs were added, new documentation format
and generator was introduced and many existing EFL/Elementary docs
were converted into the new format (old format is considered deprecated).
The Eo file grammar was made stricter and additional error checks were
added. Preparations for enabling of the Eo file validator were made, but
are not yet complete.

Edje / EDC
A new flag has been added to parts: "no_render". When set to 1, the part
should never be visible on the canvas, but can still be used as a mask or
a proxy source.

It is now possible to change a part's clipper by setting an overriding
clip_to value in the state description.

The text and image filters for evas are now better integrated in EDC,
allowing themes to use filters with animations, and refer to external

= What's New =

Even if we had only three months a lot has happened during the 1.14
release cycle.
We only cover some highlights here. For the full list please look at the
NEWS files
if you are interested in the details. As usual we have been working on
fixing bugs,
optimizing our code for speed and memory footprint and adding new features.
Below we describe just some highlights and by no means provide a full list.

== Build & Distribution ==

While we have supported parallel building a la make -j X for a long time
we had
problems with supporting it for the install target. Finally this is
solved and you can
use -j X for all your make calls now.

== Emile ==

Emile provides a library to bring together serialization, compression
and ciphering.
It is a low-level library and can be used by anything above Eina. It
came along with a
lot re-factoring of our current code base to make use of it and
de-duplicate a lot of
existing code. More refactoring is expected in ecore_con_ssl ciphering
and general
image compression.

== Ector and Evas_Object_VG (BETA) ==

Ector provides a new retained rendering library that is used by Evas to
provide
Evas_Object_VG. This is a new Evas_Object that provides a vector graphics
scene graph following the SVG specification. It will be considered a bug
if some
behaviour does not follow the SVG standard. Evas_Object_VG provides 3
kind of objects
for now: shape, as well as linear and radial gradients.

Apart from the authors you will see with git, two big thanks need to
be mentioned here. First special thanks goes to Jorge Luis "turran"
Zapata who has been
developing his own vector stack: http://enesim.org/ since a long time
now and
shared his technical advice and also strongly influenced the design. We
evaluated
the possibility to include enesim in the EFL, but that wasn't really
possible, sadly.
Another thanks goes to Jose O Gonzalez who supported and answered a lot
of my
questions and helped me a lot, too.

== EModel (BETA)==

Efl.Model is an attempt to provide a data model as in the M of MVC to
the EFL core.
A first implementation and example is provided as a Eio.Model. This,
together with
some patches in Elementary, should provide a fully asynchronous and fast
modern MVC
system for the EFL.

The API has been in review since last summer, but will still only be
accessible
with EFL BETA API and EO for now. More data models should come in the
future.

== Eo / Eolian ==

Eolian now supports parsing of @nullable and @optional args on function
parameters and is able return the class from a function and determine if a
function is implemented.

Eo remove some GCCism and make it more portable to work with other
compilers.

== EvasGL  ==

Together with a lot bug fixes Evas GL got support for 3.0 and automatic
fallback to indirect rendering when the scene has not changed.

== Evas ==

The gl_x11 Evas engines gained support for the TBM native surface type
(for Tizen)
as well as support for bitmap embedded color fonts.

== Ecore_Evas ==

With eetpack we added a small utility for packing files (images) into
eet files.

== Edje ==

Edje received many updates for its edit capabilities, especially around
box and
table. It also received 3D camera properties in edje_cc, colorclass
updates, zoom
effects for map and more.

== Ecore DRM ==

Many new features and bug fixes have been put into ecore_drm this cycle
while its
usage in the Enlightenment Wayland compositor is progressing.
Functionality as
been added to support DPMS on outputs, setting output, marking
framebuffers as
dirty, disabling an output, ouput EDID parsing as well as support for
libinput 0.8
and higher.

== Unit Testing ==

We improved out test coverage from 38.5% to 39.3% during the 1.14
release cycle. This does
not sound much but given the size of our code base and the amount of new
code added
even a small increase of 0.8% coverage is a good step forward.
