This package has all the config files and dependencies
to setup a system in a way, that new privileges are disabled
(no_new_privs or NoNewPrivs flags and options).

This means, that no setuid or setgid binary will work anymore.

A list of setuid binaries that no longer work completely or at all,
as well as their replacement files:

* cron -> systemd.timer
* pkexec -> run0
* su -> run0
* sudo -> run0
* pam_unix.so -> pam_unix_ng.so
