    <comment>- Update to version 43.0:
  + The Welcome screen has been removed, as its design didn't
    really work out.
  + The notification system was switched to use AdwToast instead of
    the older, custom notifications.
  + Styles have been updated to fit a more Adwaita-like design.
  + Lots of bugs have been squashed, leading to a more stable
    experience.
  + Updated translations.
- Add check section and run meson_test macro during build. (forwarded request 1073108 from iznogood)</comment>
