  <title>Command Line Tool for Searching Electronic Dictionaries</title>
  <description>eblook is a command line tool that uses the EB library. It provides
easy access to many electronic dictionaries published on CD-ROM.

It is recommended that you install the Emacs interface lookup.el, too.
Although it is possible to use eblook from the command line, using it
with Emacs or XEmacs and lookup.el is much easier and offers many extra
features.

You can get lookup.el from http://lookup.sourceforge.net/.

lookup.el is already included as a package in recent versions of
XEmacs.</description>
