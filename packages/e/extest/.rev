    <comment>Initial version of Extest.
Extest is a drop in replacement for the X11 XTEST extension. It creates a virtual device with the uinput kernel module. It's been primarily developed for allowing the desktop functionality on the Steam Controller to work while Steam is open on Wayland.</comment>

    <comment>Steam is a 32bit application, so extest can only work when it's 32bit build is used, even on x86_64 machines. Therefore, this change is required for Steam to actually make use of the library.
