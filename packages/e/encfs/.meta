  <title>Userspace Encrypted File System</title>
  <description>EncFS provides an encrypted file system, layered on top of a normal
directory tree and encrypts individual files which are stored in the
hosting directory tree.

This has several advantages over the loopback encryption which
   provided by the Linux kernel: - No space is and has to be
   reserved, encrypted files only take the space that they really
   occupy

- Backups: encrypted files can be individually backed-up on the host
   filesystem

- Layering: Since it's hosted on a normal filesystem, encfs can be
   used on filesystems which normally have no support encryption,
   like NFS or other userspace filesystems.

EncFS is implemented as a userspace filesystem in an unprivileged
application using fuse (FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace)).</description>
