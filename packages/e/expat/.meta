  <title>XML Parser Toolkit</title>
  <description>Expat is an XML 1.0 parser written in C. It aims to be fully
conformant. It is currently not a validating XML processor. The current
production version of expat can be downloaded from
ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip. The directory xmltok contains a
low-level library for tokenizing XML. The interface is documented in
xmltok/xmltok.h. The directory xmlparse contains an XML parser library
that is built on top of the xmltok library. The interface is documented
in xmlparse/xmlparse.h. The directory sample contains a simple example
program using this interface. The file sample/build.bat is a batch
file to build the example using Visual C++. The directory xmlwf
contains the xmlwf application, which uses the xmlparse library. The
arguments to xmlwf are one or more files to check for well-formedness.
An option -d dir can be specified. For each well-formed input file, the
corresponding canonical XML is written to dir/f, where f is the
filename (without any path) of the input file. A -x option causes
references to external general entities to be processed. A -s option
makes documents that are not stand-alone cause an error (a document is
considered stand-alone if it is intrinsically stand-alone because it
has no external subset and no references to parameter entities in the
internal subset or it is declared as stand-alone in the XML
declaration).</description>
