    settings.

    made in the last release.
- Changes in 0.9.16.0:
  Breaking changes:
  * The accompany objective on mission npcs no longer implicitly
    sets the save objective. Plugin missions that had "accompany"
    but not "save" should be changed to include "save" if the
    intention of the mission is that the npcs live.
  Bug fixes:
  * Typo fixes.
  * The Firestorm Battery outfit now has a proper plural name.
  * The Mule's description has been updated to reflect its new
    category.
  * Corrected the name of the passenger in "FW Pug 4."
  * Added a firing sound to the Ka'het Annihilator Turret, as it
    was missing one.

    deadline.
  * Replaced some small numbers that were written as digits with
    words.

  * The Archon missions will now refresh once on old saves so that
    the new missions are used.
  * The Syndicate ships that attack New Tibet in the FW campaign
    will now be properly hostile to your mission escorts.
  * Hard set the npc name in a Scar's Legion mission description to
    point to the correct npc to kill.
  * Fixed a Remnant rescue job that had an npc location that should
    not have been allowed.
  * Cleaned up the audio on some sound files that had audible
    clicking.
  * Remnant cargo that Korath ships in the Ember Waste carry is now
    more fitting to the lore of their situation.
  * Fixed the object sprites and scaling in the Ssil Vida event.
  * The jump range of systems affected by the Ssil Vida activation
    are now reset when Ssil Vida is deactivated in order to avoid
    a bug in pathfinding. This change will be reverted in the future
    once the pathfinding is improved.
  * Changed a Remnant bounty mission that had an unconstrained npc
    with a jump drive to spawn one without a jump drive as to stop
    the ship from escaping the Ember Waste.
  * Added a fallback mission for people who were in the middle of
    a section of the FW campaign that was changed.
  * The load panel now only lists .txt files from the save folder
    instead of listing every file there.
  * Traveling between systems no longer assumes that hyperdrives
    are always cheaper to use than jump drives.
  * Fixed an error where attempting to launch with a fighter as
    your flagship under certain circumstances could cause you
    to launch with no ship at all.
  * Mission npcs that become disabled by corrosion damage will
    now properly have the disable objective set.
  * Disallowed planet labels from jumping around at different
    zoom levels for a better viewing experience.
  * Fixed a longstanding bug where npcs could get stuck thinking
    they need fuel after traveling through a wormhole.
  * Fixed a bug where fighters would sometimes fail to reparent to
    a carrier that had space for them when recalled.
  Game content:
  * The last mission to give jump drives to the Unfettered is now
    a repeating job instead of a spaceport mission.
  * Added H2H weapons to some Hai ships and increased the base
    crew stats of the Unfettered.
  * Slightly reworked the atomic and ion flare effects.
  * Recategorized the Hai Centipede as a space liner.
  * Changed the landscape images of Mainsail and Inmost Blue to
    better fit their planet descriptions.
  * Recategorized the Saryd Traveler as a utility ship.
  User interface:
  * Clicking on a planet card on the left side of the map now
    selects that planet as a destination on your travel plan.
  Under the hood:
  * Fixed a link in the README to point to the proper location.
  * Made a few small code improvements that were found by
    various compilers and linters.
  * Added new PR labels to the contributing guidelines file.
  * Improved the printing of game data when using the command
    line options.
