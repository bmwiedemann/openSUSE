Sun Mar 20 21:35:29 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.18:
  * The shell escape command (!) now flushes stdout so that the modified command
    is always printed before being executed even if standard output is fully
    buffered (for example, a file).
  * A couple of harmless memory leaks have been fixed. (They both happened just
    before ed exits). 
  * The pointer returned by the function 'strip_escapes' is now checked. (It may
    be null if memory is exhausted).
  * The shell escape command (!) now removes the backslash from each escaped '%'
    character within the text of the shell command line.
  * Case-insensitive regular expressions have been implemented as in GNU sed.
  * Syntax errors in regular expressions, for example unmatched ( or \(, no
    longer overwrite a previously compiled regular expression, preventing a
    "No previous pattern" error.
  * The option '--strip-trailing-cr', which removes carriage returns at end of
    text lines, has been added.
  * Loading a file now fails if a line is longer than INT_MAX bytes or if the
    file contains more than INT_MAX lines (usually 2 Gi lines). (Instead of
    overflowing line addresses).
  * In interactive mode ed now sets final exit status to 1 if a fatal error
    happens while reading the file passed in the command line.
  * red now reports "Directory access restricted" instead of "Invalid filename"
    when trying to edit a file outside of the current directory.
  * The new chapter "The 's' Command" has been added to the manual.
- switch to zstd

Mon Jan 25 10:34:49 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

  * The commands 'q' and 'Q' now work in a global command.
  * The new option '-E, --extended-regexp' has been added. It tells
    ed to use extended regular expressions instead of the basic
    regular expressions mandated by POSIX
  * Print the file name in case of read or write error
