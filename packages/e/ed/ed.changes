Mon Jan 16 22:16:48 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 1.19:
  * Reading a non-existent file with commands 'e' or 'E' did set the
    'modified' flag, which prevented a following 'e' command from
    succeeding
  * The long name of option '-s' has been changed to '--script'.
    Option '-s' now only suppresses byte counts and the '!' prompt
    as mandated by POSIX. It no longer suppresses diagnostic
    messages written to stderr.
  * The short name '-q' has been assigned to options '--quiet' and
    '--silent'. Option '-q' now only suppresses diagnostic messages
    written to stderr.
  * The help message showing the line where a script error happened
    when ed's input is from a regular file is now printed to stdout
    instead of stderr because it is enabled by the 'H' command.
  * Ed no longer processes file names for backslash escapes.
  * It has been documented in the manual that address 0 is valid as
    a starting point for searches so that '0;/RE/' can match the
    regular expression RE in the first line of the buffer.
  * It has been documented in the manual how to achieve the effect
    of ex style '!' filtering with a sequence of commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 20 21:35:29 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.18:
  * The shell escape command (!) now flushes stdout so that the modified command
    is always printed before being executed even if standard output is fully
    buffered (for example, a file).
  * A couple of harmless memory leaks have been fixed. (They both happened just
    before ed exits). 
  * The pointer returned by the function 'strip_escapes' is now checked. (It may
    be null if memory is exhausted).
  * The shell escape command (!) now removes the backslash from each escaped '%'
    character within the text of the shell command line.
  * Case-insensitive regular expressions have been implemented as in GNU sed.
  * Syntax errors in regular expressions, for example unmatched ( or \(, no
    longer overwrite a previously compiled regular expression, preventing a
    "No previous pattern" error.
  * The option '--strip-trailing-cr', which removes carriage returns at end of
    text lines, has been added.
  * Loading a file now fails if a line is longer than INT_MAX bytes or if the
    file contains more than INT_MAX lines (usually 2 Gi lines). (Instead of
    overflowing line addresses).
  * In interactive mode ed now sets final exit status to 1 if a fatal error
    happens while reading the file passed in the command line.
  * red now reports "Directory access restricted" instead of "Invalid filename"
    when trying to edit a file outside of the current directory.
  * The new chapter "The 's' Command" has been added to the manual.
- switch to zstd
- remove usrmerged handling

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 25 10:34:49 UTC 2021 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- Update to 1.17 
  * The commands 'q' and 'Q' now work in a global command.
  * The new option '-E, --extended-regexp' has been added. It tells
    ed to use extended regular expressions instead of the basic
    regular expressions mandated by POSIX
  * Print the file name in case of read or write error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
