  <title>Elektra</title>
  <description>Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair mechanism, instead of each
program using its own text configuration files. This allows any program
to read and save its configuration with a consistent API, and allows
them to be aware of other applications' configurations, permitting
easy application integration. While architecturally similar to other OS
registries, Elektra does not have most of the problems found in those
implementations.</description>
