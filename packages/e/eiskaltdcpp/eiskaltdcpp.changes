  * Add reload config by SIGHUP.
- Removed support for openSUSE <= 12.2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  3 22:10:48 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 2.2.9:
  common changes:
  * Fixed build with GCC < 4.6 and Clang < 3.1. This is the last release with
    support of old compilers.
  * Fixed cmake rules for building with sr@latin localization.
  * Small code refactoring and optimisation.
  eiskaltdcpp-qt:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 10 18:15:42 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 2.2.8:
  common changes:
  * Fix build with Boost >= 1.50. Dropped support for Boost < 1.39.
  * Added support of Lua 5.1.x (used by default) and Lua 5.2.x.
  * The local copy of miniupnpc is updated to version 1.7. Build with old
    miniupnpc versions (1.5.x and 1.6.x) is still supported.
  * Fix connection problem when hub domain name has IPv6 address. While we do
    not have IPv6 support yet, hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC was causing the
    connection problem. [Thanks to Jan Vidar Krey]
  * Changed logic of search intervals: now minimum search interval can be equal
    to zero. [Thanks to Dmitry Arkhipov]
  * Fixed file names for cache of public hub lists: now these files are saved
    and loaded properly.
  * Now mutexes from C++11 standard are used in *nix systems. While MinGW does
    not support this feature, mutexes from Boost are used in MS Windows.
    Added cmake option DO_NOT_USE_MUTEX (default: OFF), which switches on the
    old algorithm: Haiku and WINE do not support mutexes yet, so this option
    is necessary for them. Also this option is used for build in Mac OS X.
  * Added option for keeping unfinished downloads of file-lists in queue
    between program restart. (Disabled by default, because it is not very
    useful: user may leave hub or change CID and such file-list will be in
    download queue until you manually delete it.)
  * Added option for choosing MIME handler (i.e. kfmclient, gnome-open). Use
    MimeHandler field in DCPlusPlus.xml to set it manually.
  * Fixed buffer overflow error on exit. Problem was caused by attempt to read
    data from closed UDP socket.
  * Thanks to Helder Cesar the Portuguese translation is now available.
  * Some improvements for build in Haiku.
  * Small code refactoring.
  eiskaltdcpp-qt:
  * Fixed opening of public hub lists from cache.
  * Added progress bar into search widget.
  * Added menu item "Match all listings".
  * Added button "Match queue" into the share browser widget.
  * More consistent handling of magnet links from command line arguments.
    [Thanks to Dorian Scholz]
  * Small improvement in download queue widget: use current filename in save
    dialog.
  * Added new qtscript for tools panel: NowPlaying QMMP Script.
    [Thanks to Gustavo Alvarez]
  * Fixed context menu in transfer view widget. (Copying information for
    selected items worked wrong.)
  * Updated list of fake client versions in Favorite Hub settings.
  * Added menu for quick connection to favorites hubs. (See related action on
    the tools panel.)
  * Fixed emoticons processing in chats.
  * Fixed detection of users on hubs. (Sometimes program took user description
    from another hub.)
  * Lot of fixes for user commands.
  eiskaltdcpp-gtk:
  * Fixed opening of public hub lists from cache.
  * Added progress bar into search widget.
  * Added menu item "Match all listings".
  * Fixed a number of warnings about using deprecated functions in latest
    versions of Gtk+ and GLib libraries.
  * In the file list widget parsing of file lists was detached into separate
    thread, which solved the problem with a short GUI frieze during opening of
    large file lists.
  * Added menu items for opening partial file lists.
  * Added possibility of configuring the file exceptions in settings dialog.
    (In previous versions of program it was possible to configure this by
    manually editing of DCPlusPlus.xml.)
  * Improved look and fill of settings dialog.
  * Added option to show user list on the left side of hub widget.
  * Improved transfers widget: now all information is in separate columns, so
    some of them can be hided if necessary.
  eiskaltdcpp-daemon:
  * Added JSON-RPC methods: hub.getuserinfo, hub.getusers, hub.listfulldesc,
    queue.matchlists.
  * Updated JSON-RPC methods: hub.pm, show.ratio.
  * Synced available XML-RPC and JSON-RPC methods.
  * Fixed possible program crashes in magnet.add method.
  * Fixed program hang-up on exit when active hubs are not in connected state.
  * Added command line options: --syslog, --log=<file>.
  * Updated embedded mongoose library.
  * Updated embedded jsonrpc-cpp library.
  * Additional fix in jsonrpc-cpp:
    fixed segmentation fault during stopping of mongoose when it was not
    started.
  * Additional fixes in jsoncpp:
    - all source files were combined into three files (.cpp and .h)
    - added conversion from string to int/uint/int64/uint64/float/double
  * Now eiskaltdcpp-daemon is ready for daily use via JSON-RPC.
  * XML-RPC is not recommended, but it is still supported.
  eiskaltdcpp-cli:
  * Added new JSON-RPC methods: hash.pause, hash.status, hub.getuserinfo,
    hub.getusers, hub.listfulldesc, methods.list, queue.getsources,
    queue.matchlists.
  * Now eiskaltdcpp-cli-jsonrpc is ready for daily use.
  * eiskaltdcpp-cli-xmlrpc is not supported.

   (http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)
- removed  gcc-4.7,patch, now upstream
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 24 18:15:18 UTC 2012 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 2.2.6:
  common changes:
  * Thanks to Konstantinos Georgokitsos the Greek translation is now available.
  * Thanks to Stefano Simoncelli the Italian translation is now available.
  * Fixed rewriting external IP when DHT is used.
  * Added support for reading and writing full TTH tree in the file attribute.
    The implementation is compatible with FlylinkDC++. Not all file systems
    allow to store data required size. If program can not record the

  eiskaltdcpp-qt:
  * Refactoring of source code. Fixed regressions that have been added in
    version 2.2.5.
  * Fixed program crash on closing hub tabs when there are open tabs with

    widget of finished transfers. [Thanks to Viranch Mehta]
  * Fixed adding items to the list of search results when using the sort by the
    number of sources.
  * Added option to select the action when changes in active scripts
    (QtScript): do nothing, ask the user or restart scripts.
  * Fixed loading of large file lists when the restriction on the maximum file
    size is enabled: now such file lists are ignored.
  eiskaltdcpp-gtk:
  * Improved support of Gtk3.
  * Added language switcher in settings dialog.
  * Fixed bug with duplication of entries in GtkComboBoxText elements.
  * Added support of libcanberra for sound notification (option
    -DUSE_LIBCANBERRA for cmake).
  * Fixed program crash in "Indexing progress" dialog window.
  eiskaltdcpp-daemon:
  * Added command line option: --debug
  * Added new JSON-RPC methods: methods.list, hash.pause, hash.status,
    queue.getsources
  eiskaltdcpp-cli:
  * Added new JSON-RPC methods: queue.list, queue.listtargets, search.clear
- Added a patch (gcc-4.7.patch) to fix compilation with gcc-4.7 (taken from
  upstream).
- Changes based on spec-cleaner run.
- Require lua51-devel instead of lua-devel (5.2) for openSUSE > 12.1 (package
  fails to compile with lua-5.2).
- Added openssl-devel build dependency.
- Enabled compilation with miniupnpc for openSUSE > 12.1.
- Removed libglade2-devel from build requirements (not needed).
- Require at least gtk2 version 2.24 (support for older versions was removed
  from the package).
- Enabled compilation with USE_QT_QML cmake variable for openSUSE > 11.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 20 13:49:50 UTC 2012 - tejas.guruswamy@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.2.5. Notable changes:
    + common changes
      * Reorganized the source tree.
      * Added ZLIF support into core.
      * Added core settings: UseADLOnlyOnOwnList, AllowUploadOverMultiHubs,
        AllowSimUploads.
      * Added ability to build the program with miniupnpc version 1.6. Support
        for version 1.5 saved. The local copy of miniupnpc is updated to version 1.6.
      * Fixed program crash when using of changed value of IpTOSValue (default -1)
        without root privileges.
      * Added recognition of additional fields from file lists of FlylinkDC++:
        bitrate audio, video and resolution.
      * Cleanup of code, small optimizations.
      * Small improvements for Lua scripts support in MS Windows.
      * Fixed build with Boost >= 1.48.
      * Transifex web service is used for translators now:
        http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/MakingTranslations
        https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/eiskaltdcpp/
    + eiskaltdcpp-qt
      * Refactoring of source code. Regressions are possible.
      * Now GCC >= 4.5.0 is required for build. (Features from C++11 are used)
      * Fixed build in Haiku OS. System algorithm to test run only one instance
        of the program is used now.
      * A lot of new methods are now available using QtScript. See:
        http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting
        http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting_QtScript_Example_Scripts
        http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting_Working_With_QtScript
        [Thanks to OmegaPhil for an updated documentation]
      * Hot reloading of scripts (QtScript) when they have been changed.
      * Dialog of scripting (QtScript) is appreciably improved.
      * Improved method of sorting in Search Spy widget.
        [Thanks to Mikhail Krasikau]
      * Added recognition of additional fields from file lists of FlylinkDC++:
        bitrate audio, video and resolution. The information is displayed in a tooltip
        for a file.
      * Added ability to clear search history and download directories history on exit
        or manualy.
      * Added some options in settings dialog: ALLOW_SIM_UPLOADS (allow simultaneous
        uploads by user from different hubs), search-history-items-number,

      * Added buttons for navigation in the file list widget: back, forward, up.
      * Shared memory is freed when program in falling down by the signal SIGSEGV.
        Without this program is run only the second time. Actual for unix-like
        systems only, in MS Windows bug was absent.
      * Fixed a simultaneous operation of the program for multiple users.
        The environment variable LOGNAME is used to identify the current user
        in unix-like systems and GetUserNameA is used in MS Windows.
      * Fixed search of alternatives for uploads.
      * Fixed context menu in chats on ADC hubs.
    + eiskaltdcpp-gtk
      * Support of builds with Gtk < 2.24 was discontinued.

        bitrate audio, video and resolution. The information is displayed
        in additional columns.
      * Fixed chat command /ws.
      * Search widget is appreciably redesigned.
      * Free space indicator was added into main window.
      * Added options: use-native-back-color-for-text, show-transfers.

Mon Oct  3 09:28:07 UTC 2011 - tejas.guruswamy@opensuse.org

- Update to 2.2.4. Notable changes:
    + common changes 
        * Partial synchronization with DC++ kernel (0.785).
        * Now GCC >= 4.4.0 is required for build.
        * Added support for DHT (http://www.adcportal.com/wiki/StrongDC++_DHT). 
          This option is disabled in the settings by default. It is possible to 
          completely remove support for DHT during configuration (option 
          -DWITH_DHT for cmake). DHT requires white external IPv4 for a work. See 
          also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table
        * Fixed build in Mac OS X.
    + eiskaltdcpp-qt 
        * Added some options in settings dialog: DHT, DHT_PORT
        * Fixed wrong logging of private chats.
        * Added Stop button in the search widget, which only stops adding new 
          elements to the frame. Responses to the search query will still come 
          from other clients, but will be ignored. This is caused by 
          peculiarities of the protocol...
        * Improvement in the search widget: pressing Return key in size entry field starts searching.
        * Added possibility to connect to hubs on encoded URLs (for example: 
          dchub://%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B1.%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82.%D1%80%D1%84)
        * Implemented delayed filling model in the file list widget, which 
          significantly reduces memory consumption and does not create a short 
          GUI freeze. Especially noticeable when opening large file lists.
        * Fixed definition of user availability status in the favorite users widget.
        * Fixed display the progress of over 100% in downloads progress indicator in the active transfers widget.
        * Changed algorithm to test run only one instance of the program. Now QSharedMemory is used.
    + eiskaltdcpp-gtk 
        * Migrating from Libglade to GtkBuilder. Compatibility with the code base of LinuxDC++ and FreeDC++ was partially lost.
        * Transition to Gtk+ version 2.24 was made: there are no deprecated 
          elements in code now. Support of older versions (only Gtk >= 2.18) is 
          temporarily retained by using the insertions in code and additional 
          patches.
