- Replace inkscape by rsvg-convert: reduces build time
  dependencies and works without GUI fixing build failures on
  openSUSE >= 1550; BuildRequires: rsvg-convert (rsvg-view for
  Leap 15.1).
- Use %license for LICENSE file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 12 11:35:40 UTC 2018 - badshah400@opensuse.org

- Add equalx-adapt-headers-for-qt5_11.patch: Include additional
  header files where needed for compilation against Qt 5.11
- Only run post(un) scripts for openSUSE < 1500; rpm file triggers
  take care of these for newer releases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  2 17:37:46 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add manually created appdata file and install it.

- Use inkscape instead of convert to generate the hires icons;
  convert messes up the icon image geometry for unknown reasons.

Thu Apr 30 20:52:09 UTC 2015 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- In factory, compile against QT5.

Wed Mar 26 21:55:57 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.7.1: 
  + No list of changes from upstream
  + Build process changed: make install no longer does anything;
    use 'install' to manually copy generated binary to %{_bindir}
    instead
- Use desktop file shipped in upstream tarball
  + Drop external .desktop file
  + Add equalx-fix-desktop-file.patch: Fix icon tag in shipped
    desktop file and categories for compatibility with openSUSE
    defined ones; also fix incorrect Version tag usage
- Add BuildRequires on inkscape too, required for generation of
  proper hi-res png icons from svg icon file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 25 00:21:39 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 0.7.0:
  + No list of changes from upstream
- Add explicit Requires on ghostscript and poppler-tools (these
  would have been pulled in by texlive-latex anyway, but just in
  case)
- Add Requires on libqt4-sql-sqlite: required for working history
  and bookmark features
- Do not package COPYING: file is no longer present in upstream
  tarball
- Also supply and package .desktop file and necessary icons:
  introduces BuildRequires on desktop-file-utils and
  hicolor-icon-theme (additionally, /usr/bin/convert is used to
  generate some missing hi-res icons during %install, also needs
  ghostscript fonts)
- Package the resources dir in %{_datadir} so that equalx can find
  the necessary resources (e.g. symbols) at runtime.
