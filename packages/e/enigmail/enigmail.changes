    default.
  * Support for Pretty Easy Privacy (p≡p) is implemented in
    Enigmail.

    will try to download unavailable keys during message
    composition from WKD. GnuPG 2.2.x is used the provider
    supports the Web Key Service protocol, users can also use
    Enigmail to upload keys to WKD.
  * The message subject can now be encrypted and replaced with a
    dummy subject, following the Memory Hole standard for
    protected Email Headers.
  * The keys on the keyring are automatically refreshed from
    keyservers at an irregular interval.
  * Enigmail was turned into a "restartless" addon. That is, once
    Enigmail is installed, subsequent updates will be installed
    without needing to restart Thunderbird.
  * Keys are internally addressed using the fingerprint instead of
    the key ID.
