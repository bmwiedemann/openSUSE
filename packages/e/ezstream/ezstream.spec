%description
Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming servers.

The basic mode of operation streams media files or data from standard
input without reencoding and thus requires little resources. It can
use various external transcoders and stream the result. Additional
features include scriptable playlist and metadata handling.

Supported media formats for streaming are MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg
Theora. Native metadata support includes MP3 (ID3v1 only) and Ogg,
plus all those known to TagLib.
