  <title>A Lisp Library for GNU Emacs</title>
  <description>This package contains the complete GNU Emacs Lisp Library, Elib Version
1.0.  Elib was developed as a library for Emacs-Lisp programs for the
same reasons that libg++ was developed for C++ programs.

Elib contains macros for:

- container data structures (queues, stacks, AVL trees, and more)

- string handling routines missing in standard Emacs

- routines to handle cookies in a buffer</description>
