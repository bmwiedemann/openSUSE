  <description>Emacs-w3m is an interface program to use w3m with Emacs.

W3 is the most well known WEB browser which works on (X)Emacs, but it
is very slow. Emacs-w3m is an alternative. It uses w3m, which is a pager
with WWW capability, developed by Akinori ITO. It is a pager, but it
can be used as a text-mode WWW browser.
