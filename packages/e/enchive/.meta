  <title>Long-term archive encryption tool</title>
  <description>Enchive is a tool to encrypt files to yourself for long-term archival.
It's a focused, simple alternative to more complex solutions such as
GnuPG or encrypted filesystems.

Files are secured with ChaCha20, Curve25519, and HMAC-SHA256.
