  <title>An ASCII to PostScript(tm) Converter</title>
  <description>Enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript and writes the generated
output to a file or sends it directly to the printer.

The Enscript configuration file is in /etc/enscript.cfg.

Warning: enscript is not able to convert complex unicode (UTF-8) text
to PostScript.	Only language text which can be converted from UTF-8 to
latin encodings are supported with the help of a wrapper script. ~ ~</description>
