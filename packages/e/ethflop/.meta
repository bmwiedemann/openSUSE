  <title>A network-backed floppy emulator for DOS</title>
  <description>ethflop is a network-backed floppy emulator for DOS, mapping a DOS
floppy drive to a remote disk image. This package contains the server
and the DOS TSR.

Features
 - emulates many types of virt. floppies (from 360K up to 31M)
 - requires only a working packet driver for connectivity
 - presents a block device to DOS, almost undistinguishable from a real FDD
 - fits in 2K of memory (and can be loaded high)
