  <title>An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-planewave code</title>
  <description>An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave
(FP-LAPW) code with many features. The code is designed to be as
simple as possible so that new developments in the field of density
functional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.
