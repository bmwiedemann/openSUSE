- Adjust wannier90-devel dependencies so as to build against its
  correct openmpi flavour and avoid degeneracy between its multiple
  openmpi flavours when installing.
- Add rpmlintrc file to suppress false positives that cannot be
  fixed/worked around:
  * openmpi-libs Requires: necessary for multiple openmpi flavours.
  * Requires: wannier90-devel (or its appropriate openmpi flavour
    in keeping with the first entry of this changeset.

- Update to version 8.6.7:
  * Added dynamical Born effective charges (dynBEC).
  * Included a dynBEC example of hexagonal boron nitride.
  * Fixed a problem with spin-unpolarised DFT+U calculations.
  * Updated to Libxc version 6.
  * Changed to single-precision orbitals in many routines.
  * Removed the bundled BLAS/LAPACK and FFTPACK libraries.
- Adapt configuration of make.inc to conform to new version.

- Update to version 8.5.10:
  * Improved OpenMP parallelism.
  * Added variables to VARIABLES.OUT which are written on
    completion of geometry optimisation, for example 'engytot
    (geomopt)'.
  * Adjusted several default parameters.
- Drop sources/patches that are no longer used:
  * make.inc.bz2: make.inc is now generated in specfile
  * usefftw3.patch.bz2: upstream make.defs takes care of this
  * Makefile_src.patch.bz2: outdated and not needed any more.
- Switch to multibuild for multiple openmpi flavours, plus non-
  mpi flavour, common data, utilities, etc.
- New BuildRequires: pkgconfig(libxc), pkgconfig(wannier).
- Numerous specfile cleanups.

  recent lapack now build correctly for all suse version
