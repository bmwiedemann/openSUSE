- Update to v12.0.0
  * This is the 12.0.0 major release.
    This release focused on migrating the development baseline from
    Java 8 to Java 11, migrating to JUnit 5, enhancing performance,
    adding new API methods, improving test coverage, and updating
    dependencies. The team has also made significant efforts to
    reduce technical debt and improve code quality.

      implementations to LazyIterable.
