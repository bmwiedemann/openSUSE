Subject: [PATCH] bookmark-properties: fix on_tags_activated callback

The callback was taking wrong arguments, as the callback is supposed to
take two arguments, not three, and the user_data is in the second one.
The third one was NULL presumably because the register was zeroed.

This fixes crash when editing bookmark tags.
