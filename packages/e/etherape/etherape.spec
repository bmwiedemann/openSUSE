%description
EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix, modeled after
etherman. Featuring link layer, IP, and TCP modes, it displays network
activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic.
Various protocols are color coded in the display. It supports ethernet,
FDDI, token ring, ISDN, PPP, and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to
show and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network.
