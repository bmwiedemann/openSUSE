  <title>EditorConfig core library written in C</title>
  <description>EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style when switching
between different text editors and between different projects. The EditorConfig
project maintains a file format and plugins for various text editors which allow
this file format to be read and used by those editors. For information on the
file format and supported text editors, see the EditorConfig website.
