  <title>Instant Messenger Client for GNOME, based on Telepathy</title>
  <description>Empathy is a messaging program which supports text, voice, and video
chat and file transfers over many different protocols. You can tell it
about your accounts on all those services and do all your chatting
within one application.

Empathy uses Telepathy for protocol support and has a user interface
based on Gossip. Empathy is the default chat client in current
versions of GNOME, making it easier for other GNOME applications to
integrate collaboration functionality using Telepathy.</description>
