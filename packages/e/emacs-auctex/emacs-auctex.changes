- Update to AUCTeX ELPA version 14.0.7 (2024-10-05)
  ** Added
  - Respect the value of ~TeX-output-dir~ when processing files with
    latexmk.  This means that the default value of ~TeX-command-list~ is
    changed.
  - Add new support files =style/authblk.el=, =style/langscibook.cls=,
    =style/lstautogobble.el=, =style/lstlinebgrd.el=,
    =style/ninecolors.el=, =style/supertabular.el=, =style/tabularray.el=
    and =style/xtab.el=.
  ** Fixed
  - Fold argument of verbatim macros more accurately.
  ** Removed
  - Remove the possibility to disable the side-wide installation with:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (unload-feature 'tex-site)
    #+end_src
    Using this form when installed from [[ELPA:auctex.html][ELPA]] will
    throw an error.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  9 13:28:42 UTC 2024 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 13.4
  * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 26.1 or higher.
  * LaTeX abbrevs are now available in docTeX mode buffers.
  * AUCTeX temporarily rebinds the variable ‘gc-cons-percentage’ to a
    higher value during parsing which speeds up the process
    significantly.  The memory pressure should still be acceptable,
    even on older machines.
  * Macros provided by the ‘xparse’ package are part of LaTeX kernel
    since October 2020.  AUCTeX tracks this change and the content of
    ‘xparse.el’ is moved into ‘latex.el’ and ‘font-latex.el’
    respectively.
  * The variable ‘preview-scale-function’ is now allowed as a
    file-local variable where the assigned value can only be between
    0.1 and 10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  3 11:31:29 UTC 2023 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Run TeX-auto-generate-global in emacs only once if auctex or
  TeXLive becomes updated to generate all auto lisp files. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  2 11:11:34 UTC 2023 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 13.2
  * AUCTeX no longer refuses to insert dollar sign when you type ‘$’ at
    point where AUCTeX thinks the current math mode didn’t start with
    dollar(s).  AUCTeX assumes the user knows that it isn’t in math
    mode actually.
    You can keep the former behavior by enabling the new customize
    option ‘TeX-refuse-unmatched-dollar’.
  * AUCTeX supports completion-at-point of macro and environment
    arguments in LaTeX buffers.  The responsible function recognizes
    the argument position and extracts the corresponding candidates
    from the variables ‘TeX-symbol-list’ and ‘LaTeX-environment-list’.
  * AUCTeX underlines the argument of macros which produce underlined
    text in the final product with ‘font-latex-underline-face’.  The
    corresponding keyword class is called ‘underline-command’.  See the
    section for fontification of macros if you dislike this feature and
    wish to deactivate it.
  * Support for the Sioyek document viewer is added.
  * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 25.1 or higher.
  * AUCTeX tracks the change in Emacs where initial inputs in the
    minibuffer during queries are getting phased out.  Queries for the
    mandatory arguments of macros and environments are adjusted where
    applicable.  The value which will be used after hitting ‘RET’
    without other input is shown in the prompt in parentheses prefixed
    with ‘default’.  For this change the signature of the function
    ‘TeX-arg-length’ is altered.  The old argument list was:
         (defun TeX-arg-length (optional &optional prompt
                                         initial-input definition default)
    whereas the new one is:
         (defun TeX-arg-length (optional &optional prompt
                                         default initial-input definition)
    Note the position change of ‘DEFAULT’.
  * Indenting of conditionals is improved.  Code inside constructs like
    ‘\ifx . \else . \fi’ is correctly indented.  An interface for style
    files is also introduced which can add their macros to the
    indentation engine.  Check the file ‘algpseudocode.el’ for an
    example.
  * You can optionally enable indent inside square brackets ‘[]’ by new
    user options ‘TeX-indent-open-delimiters’ and
    ‘TeX-indent-close-delimiters’.
  * Now ‘tex-buf.el’ is merged into ‘tex.el’ and no longer exists.  If
    your personal code has ‘(require 'tex-buf)’, one of the following
    prescriptions would serve.
      1. Remove ‘(require 'tex-buf)’.
      2. Replace it with ‘(require 'tex)’.
      3. Replace it with ‘(require 'latex)’.
  * When you edit a document divided into multiple files, auto parsed
    information for all sub files are saved under ‘auto’ subdirectory
    at master directory when ‘TeX-parse-self’ and ‘TeX-auto-save’
    options are enabled.  Now you can have support ‘.el’ file saved
    under ‘auto’ subdirectory of each directory of the sub file when
    the sub files aren’t located at the master directory.
    To achieve that, set new user option ‘TeX-auto-save-aggregate’ to
    ‘nil’.
  * There was another hook where former dynamic free variables could be
    used.  The usage was invalidated at version 13.1, by introduction
    of lexical binding over AUCTeX.
    The functions in ‘TeX-region-hook’ could access the free variables
    ‘master-buffer’ and ‘orig-buffer’.  Those are now named
    ‘TeX-region-master-buffer’ and ‘TeX-region-orig-buffer’,
    respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 13 09:23:22 UTC 2023 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Add patch auctex-13.1-expand.patch
  * Let it build with latest texinfo and TeXLive
- Add keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 12 08:33:25 UTC 2022 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 13.1
  * In math environments 'gather', 'gather*', 'gathered', 'multline'
    and 'multline*', fill commands such as 'M-q' and 'C-c C-q C-e' are
    disabled.  This sorts out the inconsistency between those and
    'equation', 'displaymath' environments, in latter of which filling
    is already disabled.

    If you want filling in such environments, customize
    'LaTeX-indent-environment-list' to remove them.

    Auto fill continues to work in such environment anyway.

    In addition, AUCTeX adds support of alignment at '&' sign in
    'align'-like environments such as 'alignat', 'aligned' and so on,
    as well as 'matrix'-like environments such as 'pmatrix', 'bmatrix'
    and so on.

  * Now two commands 'Texindex' and 'Texi2dvi' are available when you
    type 'C-c C-c' in Texinfo mode.  The command 'Texindex' runs
    'texindex' on index files and 'Texi2dvi' runs 'pdftexi2dvi' or
    'texi2dvi' according to the value of 'TeX-PDF-mode'.

    So you can typeset Texinfo documents into PDF or DVI format from
    within AUCTeX.

  * AUCTeX's own help messages for LaTeX errors are now shown only for
    LaTeX runs.  AUCTeX shows raw error/warning messages found in
    '.log' files for runs of formats other than LaTeX, such as plain
    TeX, ConTeXt and Texinfo, as it does even for LaTeX runs when it
    can't find a matching entry in its own help message catalogue.

    Due to this change, customize option 'TeX-error-description-list'
    can no longer have a fallback entry that matches any error.  If
    your customized value includes such entry, typically '(".*" . "No
    help available")', please remove it.

  * Two functions 'TeX-split-string' and 'TeX-assoc' are now obsolete
    and will be removed in future release.  If your personal code uses
    these functions, use 'split-string' and 'assoc-string' instead.

  * The function 'TeX-read-key-val' now accepts a function call as
    second argument.  This change should help AUCTeX style writers who
    use 'TeX-arg-key-val' and have to deal with dynamic key-values.
    Example of usage:
         (TeX-add-style-hook "foo"
          (lambda ()
            (TeX-add-symbols
             '("bar" (TeX-arg-key-val (function-returning-key-val))))))

  * Since AUCTeX 12.2, 'C-x C-w' accidentally disabled the parse on
    save in that buffer, even when you enabled 'TeX-auto-save' option.
    This bug was fixed.

  * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 24.3 or higher.
+
  * Old implementations for viewers were discarded, as announced long
    before.  The variables 'TeX-output-view-style' and 'TeX-view-style'
    have no effect now.  The former placeholders '%v' and '%vv' in
    'TeX-command-list' are ignored.

  * AUCTeX now uses lexical binding which has been introduced in Emacs
    24.  This change should have no user-visible effect and require no
    manual adaptions except in the following cases.

       - Entries added to the customization variable 'TeX-expand-list'
         also had access to variables 'command' and 'pos'.  Those are
         now properly declared and named 'TeX-expand-command' and
         'TeX-expand-pos'.

       - Entries added to the customization variable 'TeX-expand-list'
         had access to a variable 'file' which was bound to
         'TeX-active-master', i.e., it evaluated to either the master
         or region file.  This usage must be replaced with either
         'TeX-active-master' or 'TeX-active-master-with-quotes'.

       - Viewer entries in 'TeX-view-program-list' also had access to a
         variable 'file' which was bound to the name of the master or
         region file without extension.  Instead, the function
         'TeX-active-master' has to be used now.

       - Macro argument parsing functions could set a variable
         'exit-mark' to the buffer position where point should be left
         after all arguments have been read.  This variable is now
         named 'TeX-exit-mark'.

       - The functions in 'LaTeX-section-hook' had access or modified
         the previously undeclared variables 'title', 'name', 'level',
         'done-mark', and 'toc'.  These variables are now properly
         declared and have the 'LaTeX-' prefix, e.g.,
         'LaTeX-done-mark'.

       - The functions in 'ConTeXt-numbered-section-hook' and
         'ConTeXt-unnumbered-section-hook' had access or modified the
         previously undeclared variables 'title', 'name', 'level',
         'done-mark', and 'reference'.  These variables are now
         properly declared and have the 'ConTeXt-' prefix, e.g.,
         'ConTeXt-title'.

       - The functions in 'TeX-translate-location-hook' could access
         and modify the free variables 'file', 'line', 'error',
         'offset', 'context', and 'string'.  Those are now properly
         declared variables with the prefix 'TeX-translate-location-',
         e.g., 'TeX-translate-location-file'.

  * The constant 'LaTeX-dialect' has been renamed to 'TeX-dialect' and
    moved from 'latex.el' to 'tex.el'.  'LaTeX-dialect' now is an
    obsolete alias.

  * The style 'latexinfo.el' is removed from AUCTeX.  'latexinfo.el'
    was meant to support latexinfo which in return was a LaTeX-2.09
    extension of Texinfo, but didn't manage to replace Texinfo.

  * The style 'siunitx.el' is updated to support package version 3.
    Key-value options provided by older package versions are removed,
    deprecated macros and units are not supported anymore.

  * AUCTeX has preliminary support for LaTeX-hooks.  Hooks provided by
    LaTeX kernel are known and available for completion in
    '\AddToHook', '\RemoveFromHook' and '\AddToHookNext'.

  * AUCTeX is now able to place all generated output files, including
    those that are produced by applications running under AUCTeX,
    temporary files related to region processing and preview-latex
    files, in an output directory.  To use this feature, set the new
    user option 'TeX-output-dir' to the absolute path of the output
    directory or a relative path which would be interpreted as being
    relative to the master file in a multifile document.

    Note that this feature doesn't work if the document includes sub
    file placed in sub directory below the main file via '\include'
    command.

  * Many other bugs were fixed.
- Port patch dvips.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 14 10:07:35 UTC 2021 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 12.3
  * Support for 'PSTricks' is now PDF-oriented.  AUCTeX no longer turns
    off PDF mode for 'PSTricks' documents even without 'pst-pdf'.  It
    now sets up 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI' option so that PDF output is
    generated when 'TeX-PDF-mode' is enabled (default).  Users who want
    DVI output should disable PDF mode explicitly by file local
    variable, or customize 'TeX-PDF-mode' to 'nil'.
  * The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' has been obsoleted in
    order to fix 'bug#37945'.  That function was used by several style
    files in order to refresh fontification after adding new symbols or
    verbatim constructs.  It is better to call 'font-lock-flush' in the
    former case and 'font-latex-set-syntactic-keywords' in the latter
    case.  The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' still exists as a
    no-op which only shows a warning explaining how to update font-lock
    as mentioned above.
  * Math expression highlighting was improved.  Highlighting for
    documents with a lot of inline math expressions '$...$' won't get
    scrambled now ('bug#33139').
  * AUCTeX tracks changes in LaTeX2e 2020-02-02 release.  AUCTeX
    supports the improvements to LaTeX font selection mechanism (NFSS).
    New macros like '\textsw' or '\textulc' are added to font insertion
    keyboard commands.  See the section for inserting font specifiers
    for details.  Further, the entries in the menu LaTeX, Insert Font
    are reorganized and adjusted accordingly.
  * Insertion of environments in LaTeX documents (i.e.  'C-c C-e') was
    improved.  The former code had a few bugs, which sometimes resulted
    in either spurious empty line or spurious comment prefix, or both,
    especially when the region is active.  Those bugs are now fixed.
  * More bugs fixed, other minor features implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 10:03:53 UTC 2020 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 12.2 to avoid obsolete (process-kill-without-query) (boo#1175274)
  * AUCTeX reflects the changes in LaTeX2e 2019-10-01 release.
     'filecontents' environment now takes an optional argument and can
     be used anywhere in a document.  The macros '\Ref' and
     '\labelformat' are moved from 'varioref.sty' to LaTeX kernel.
     amsmath has a new macro '\overunderset'.
  * A new method is implemented in preview-latex to adjust the
    foreground colors of generated images to those of Emacs, when the
    LaTeX command produces PDF.  The traditional method became invalid
    because of the change introduced in Ghostscript 9.27.
    Unfortunately, the new method doesn't work due to a bug in
    Ghostscript 9.27 and is valid only for Ghostscript > 9.27.  There
    is also a fallback method for gs 9.27 users which displays plain
    "black on white" images.  For successful function of preview-latex,
    the users are encouraged to set up the new user option
    'preview-pdf-color-adjust-method' to choose appropriate option
    among the three: new, traditional and fallback method.
  * AUCTeX has support for the Flymake package in Emacs 26 or newer.
    To enable, call 'M-x flymake-mode RET' or add this to your '.emacs'
    file:
         (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'flymake-mode)
  * The way the option 'TeX-record-buffer' is used was corrected.  It
    was used in just the opposite way as the document says.  Erase the
    customization if you have customized this option since it now acts
    in reverse to your expectation.
  * A former customize option 'japanese-TeX-command-list' is removed.
    Use 'japanese-TeX-engine-default', or if it's really necessary,
    customize 'TeX-command-list' directly if the task which the option
    used to carry is required.
  * Support for standard LaTeX without e-TeX extension is now very
    limited.  It doesn't work if raw TeX code is put on the command
    line to invoke latex command.  It also fails for region compilation
    ('C-c C-r' and so on) with documents of non-ascii file name.  In
    addition, it no longer works with preview-latex.  We consider this
    incompatibility is permissible because e-TeX extension is enabled
    for standard LaTeX by default long ago.  LaTeX variants such as
    XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are not affected.
  * Key binds in Texinfo mode are improved.  Typing '$', '^', '_' and
    '\' now just self-inserts without pointless side effects in Texinfo
    mode.
    In addition, the option 'TeX-electric-escape' is now effective in
    Texinfo mode.  When it is enabled, typing '@' will invoke
    'TeX-electric-macro' offering completion in similar style with
    other TeX modes of AUCTeX.
  * Fontification support for 'biblatex' package is improved and
    updated to macros provided by package version 3.12.  For qualified
    lists, at least 2 mandatory arguments are fontified.
  * Support for column specifiers 'w' and 'W' provided by 'array'
    package is added to 'array.el'.  The correct counting of columns
    only works when the 'align' parameter is enclosed in braces, e.g.,
    'w{l}{3cm}'.  The short version 'wl{3cm}' is not supported.
  * Entries for 'PDF Tools' are added in
    'TeX-view-program-list-builtin' for Windows and macOS. This viewer
    can be configured under these operating systems with an entry like
    this in an init file:
         (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Tools")))
  * Several other bugs were fixed, many minor features were added.
- Drop patches which seem now obsolete
  * utf8-names-3b1ffcd8.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 07:56:53 UTC 2018 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 12.1 due bug boo#1088548
  * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 24 or higher.  Support for XEmacs has

  * Besides the change in the supported version of Emacs, there has
    been no functional change in this release, which is equivalent to
    version 11.92.
  * preview-latex is compatible with Ghostscript 9.22 where the
    operator '.runandhide' is removed.  All occurrences of
    '.runandhide' in preview-latex are replaced by alternative code
    making it work with Ghostscript 9.22 again.
  * AUCTeX has a new customize option
    'TeX-math-input-method-off-regexp'.  When you begin to input a math
    formula, the current input method is turned off if its name matches
    this regular expression.
  * The window system focus is pulled back to Emacs when viewing with
    evince-compatible viewers if a new customize option
    'TeX-view-evince-keep-focus' is non-nil.
  * The usual dose of bug fixes was administered.
  * Now AUCTeX has a logo.  The LaTeX code to create it is available in
    the 'etc/' directory of the package.
  * Add support for 'upmendex', an extension of 'makeindex' capable of
    sorting indexes by unicode based ICU.
  * Fix preview-latex to interact correctly with Japanese LaTeX.  The
    parsing routine was made robust not to be confused by the 7-bit
    encoding of Japanese text and the necessary option to LaTeX command
    is kept even when preamble caching is enabled.
  * The new "Glossaries" entry in 'TeX-command-list' runs the command
    'makeglossaries'.
  * Fontification of control symbols has been improved.  Characters
    defined in 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' do not receive
    any fontification.  In DocTeX mode, the character '_' is removed
    from 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' in order to fontify
    macros like '\__module_foo:nnn' correctly.
  * Fontification of math environments has been improved.  Optional
    and/or mandatory argument(s) to environments are not fontified.
  * 'preview.sty' loads 'luatex85.sty' if possible and should be
    compatible with newer luaTeX versions.
  * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-ispell-verb-delimiters'.
    This string contains usual characters used as delimiters for
    in-line verbatim macros like '\verb'.  Text between delimiters
    after an in-line verbatim macro will be skipped during spell
    checking.
  * Fontification of in-line verbatim macros has been improved.
    'font-latex.el' recognizes an optional or a mandatory argument for
    macros like '\Verb' from 'fancyvrb.sty', '\mint' and '\mintinline'
    from 'minted.sty' and fontifies verbatim content correctly.
  * AUCTeX can put and parse labels in optional argument of
    environments.  Inserting labels is done by new function
    'LaTeX-env-label-as-keyval'.  A new customize option
    'LaTeX-listing-label' is available as prefix to labels in code
    typesetting environments, e.g.  'lstlisting' environment provided
    by 'listings' package.  'LaTeX-listing-label' defaults to 'lst:'.
    Parsing of labels for later referencing relies on two requirements:
      1. Label should come as last key-value argument, and
      2. label must be enclosed in braces, e.g.
              \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Some Caption,label={lst:foo}]
              ...
              \end{lstlisting}
  * The function 'LaTeX-label' now takes a second optional argument
    'NO-INSERT'.  When non-'nil', 'LaTeX-label' reads a label and
    returns it as a string.  This argument is also passed to any
    function bound to 'LaTeX-label-function' (see next item).
  * *Incompatible change:* The signature for the function passed with
    the customize option 'LaTeX-label-function' has changed.  The
    function bound to this variable is now expected to take an optional
    second argument 'NO-INSERT'.  When this argument is non-'nil', the
    function should read and only return a label as a string; insertion
    is done by another function.
  * Directory local variables were ineffective for
    'japanese-latex-mode' and 'japanese-plain-tex-mode'.  This bug was
    fixed.  (This was actually done in AUCTeX 11.90, but not
    advertised)
  * The output of Japanese text from Japanese TeX engines is decoded
    correctly for most cases, according to the encoding of the TeX
    documents and the locale.  The difference between MS Windows, macOS
    and unix-like OS is taken into account.  (This was actually done in
    AUCTeX 11.90, but not advertised)
  * Quite a few new LaTeX packages are supported.
  * As usual, many bugs were fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 29 09:00:16 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 11.90
   * In addition to the completion performed by 'TeX-complete-symbol',
     AUCTeX now also supports the new Emacs standard completion-at-point
     facility (see the Emacs command 'completion-at-point').  This also
     means that modern completion UIs like company-mode work out of the
     box in TeX and LaTeX buffers.
   * Completion is now aware of being inside a math environment and then
     completes math macros.
   * AUCTeX is able to display several levels of super- and subscripts,
     each one raised above and a bit smaller than its basis.  For this
     feature, have a look at the customize options
     'font-latex-fontify-script' (especially the new values
     'multi-level' and 'invisible') and
     'font-latex-fontify-script-max-level'.  Also, the script characters
     '^' and '_' are also fontified with a special face named
     'font-latex-script-char-face'.
   * Parsing of format specification in various tabular environments has
     been improved.  The function 'LaTeX-insert-item' ('C-c <LFD>')
     inserts suitable number of ampersands for '*{num}{cols}'
     constructs.  Style files for LaTeX packages 'tabularx', 'tabulary',
     'longtable', 'dcolumn' and 'siunitx' are adapted to take advantage
     of this improvement.
   * AUCTeX has a new Ispell dictionary 'tex-ispell.el' for macros and
     environments which will be skipped during spell checking.  The
     activiation of this feature is controlled by a new customize option
     'TeX-ispell-extend-skip-list', which is set to 't' and activated by
     default.
   * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-raise-frame-function' that
     is currently only used by Evince and Atril inverse search to raise
     the Emacs frame.
   * When inserting a new float, AUCTeX will now prompt for a
     short-caption if the length of the caption provided is greater than
     a certain size.  This size is controlled via a new user option
     'LaTeX-short-caption-prompt-length'.
   * Parsing of the compilation log has been reworked.  You should
     encounter fewer mistaken files while navigating through errors and
     warnings.
   * Two new user options, 'TeX-ignore-warnings' and
     'TeX-suppress-ignored-warnings', allow ignoring certain warnings
     after compilation of the document.
   * A new option, 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI', controls if and how to produce a
     PDF file by converting a DVI file.  This supersedes
     'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' which is still recognized but marked as
     obsolete and may be removed in future releases.
   * Support for a number of external viewers has been added
   * A new function, 'TeX-documentation-texdoc', for reading
     documentation with 'texdoc' has been added.  'TeX-doc' is still
     available but now 'C-c ?' runs 'TeX-documentation-texdoc'.
   * AUCTeX has a new custom option
     'LaTeX-reftex-cite-format-auto-activate' which controls the
     automatic activation of citation formats provided by RefTeX when a
     style file is loaded and RefTeX is enabled.  Currently,
     'biblatex.el', 'harvard.el', 'jurabib.el' and 'natbib.el' use this
     feature.  If you have customized 'reftex-cite-format' and want to
     use your settings, you should set this variable to 'nil'.
   * AUCTeX now has limited support for the TikZ package.  For the
     moment, this includes some basic support for prompting the user of
     arguments to the '\draw' macro.
   * The style 'graphicx.el' went through a bigger overhaul.  The
     optional argument of command '\includegraphics' now supports
     key-val query; keys can independently be chosen anytime by pressing
     the <,> key.  As a side effect, the variable
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist' is now no-op and is removed
     from 'tex-style.el'.  You can safely remove any customization of it
     from your init file.  The mandatory argument of '\includegraphics'
     knows about image file extensions supported by the used engine and
     offers them for inclusion.
   * Support for other LaTeX packages was improved, and style files for
     several new packages were added.
   * Many bugs were crushed along the way.
- Remove patch 0001-Fix_bug_in_subfigure_style_filee.patch as now upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 14:20:47 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Add patch 0001-Fix_bug_in_subfigure_style_filee.patch
  to fix build with GNU Emacs 25.1 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 19:25:26 UTC 2015 - auxsvr@gmail.com

- Remove auctex-11.86-dinbrief.dif, as it's been merged upstream, and
  everything in auctex-11.87.dif except for the dvips part (now in
  dvips.patch).  
- Update to 18.89.
  * You can now run all commands needed to compile a document and then
    open the viewer with a single command: 'TeX-command-run-all', bound
    to 'C-c C-a'.
  * Commands such as LaTeX and View can now be executed conveniently on
    the current section (or part, chapter, subsection, etc).  See
    'LaTeX-command-section' and 'LaTeX-command-section-change-level'.
  * Forward and backward search with Evince now also work when only a
    region of the document is compiled/viewed.
  * To open the PDF output file you can now use also PDF Tools, a
    document viewer for Emacs.  With it, as a plus, forward and
    backward search is accurate at word level.
  * With new option 'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' it is possible to
    compile a document to DVI and then convert it to PDF using
    'dvips'-'ps2pdf' before viewing it.
  * New option 'TeX-file-line-error' allows to select file:line:error
    style for error messages.
  * Indent '\[...\]' math mode as a regular environment by default.
  * Now AUCTeX suggests to run 'makeindex' when appropriate.
  * 'TeX-view-program-list' can contain, as third optional element of
    each item, the name of the executable(s) needed to open the viewer.
  * 'TeX-expand-list' variable has been split into 'TeX-expand-list'
    and 'TeX-expand-list-builtin'.  Only the former is intended to be
    customized by the user, the latter contains built-in expanders.
    You might want to keep in 'TeX-expand-list' only new expansion
    strings.
  * When new option 'TeX-check-engine' is non-nil, before running LaTeX
    commands AUCTeX will check whether the correct engine has been set,
    based upon known restrictions posed by LaTeX packages.
  * Basic support to ConTeXt Mark IV has been added.  Users can now
    select the Mark version to be used with new option
    'ConTeXt-Mark-version', and AUCTeX is able to catch error messages
    in the output log of a Mark IV document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 10:50:46 UTC 2015 - auxsvr@gmail.com

- Update to 11.88
  * 'TeX-PDF-mode' is now enabled.
  * 'biblatex' support was greatly expanded.  If parsing is enabled, AUCTeX
     looks at 'backend' option to decide whether to use Biber or BibTeX. The
     'LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber' variable was changed to be file local only
     and is no more customizable.by default.
  * Now you can insert '$...$' or '\(...\)' by typing a single '$'.  To do
    this, customize the new option 'TeX-electric-math'.
    'TeX-math-close-double-dollar' was removed.
  * Brace pairing feature was enhanced in LaTeX documents.  Support for
    '\bigl', '\Bigl', '\biggl' and '\Biggl', the same as the one for
    '\left', was added to 'TeX-insert-macro'.  For example, 'C-c <RET> bigl
    <RET> ( <RET>' inserts '\bigl(\bigr)'.
   * You can insert brace pair '()', '{}' and '[]' by typing a single left
     brace if the new user option 'LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace' is
     enabled.

Wed Jul 21 14:29:50 CEST 2010 - werner@suse.de

- Update to auctex 11.86
   * Parsing of LaTeX output was improved.  It is now less likely that
     AUCTeX opens a non-existent file upon calling `TeX-next-error'; a
     problem for example encountered when using MiKTeX 2.8.  In addition
     quoted file names as emitted by MiKTeX are now supported.
   * A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
     implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you
     will have to redo them in this new framework or reenable the old
     one.  See the section on viewers in the manual for details.
   * Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.
   * Support for various LaTeX packages was added, e.g. `tabularx',
     `CJK', and `hyperref'.
   * An easy way to switch between TeX engines (PDFTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX,
     Omega) was added.
   * Support for SyncTeX was added.  This involves the command line
     options for LaTeX and the viewer.
   * Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
     text.
   * `preview.sty' now works with XeTeX.
   * A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.
