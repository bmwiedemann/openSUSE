Thu Oct 14 10:07:35 UTC 2021 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 12.3
  * Support for 'PSTricks' is now PDF-oriented.  AUCTeX no longer turns
    off PDF mode for 'PSTricks' documents even without 'pst-pdf'.  It
    now sets up 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI' option so that PDF output is
    generated when 'TeX-PDF-mode' is enabled (default).  Users who want
    DVI output should disable PDF mode explicitly by file local
    variable, or customize 'TeX-PDF-mode' to 'nil'.
  * The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' has been obsoleted in
    order to fix 'bug#37945'.  That function was used by several style
    files in order to refresh fontification after adding new symbols or
    verbatim constructs.  It is better to call 'font-lock-flush' in the
    former case and 'font-latex-set-syntactic-keywords' in the latter
    case.  The function 'font-latex-update-font-lock' still exists as a
    no-op which only shows a warning explaining how to update font-lock
    as mentioned above.
  * Math expression highlighting was improved.  Highlighting for
    documents with a lot of inline math expressions '$...$' won't get
    scrambled now ('bug#33139').
  * AUCTeX tracks changes in LaTeX2e 2020-02-02 release.  AUCTeX
    supports the improvements to LaTeX font selection mechanism (NFSS).
    New macros like '\textsw' or '\textulc' are added to font insertion
    keyboard commands.  See the section for inserting font specifiers
    for details.  Further, the entries in the menu LaTeX, Insert Font
    are reorganized and adjusted accordingly.
  * Insertion of environments in LaTeX documents (i.e.  'C-c C-e') was
    improved.  The former code had a few bugs, which sometimes resulted
    in either spurious empty line or spurious comment prefix, or both,
    especially when the region is active.  Those bugs are now fixed.
  * More bugs fixed, other minor features implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 14 10:03:53 UTC 2020 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Update to 12.2 to avoid obsolete (process-kill-without-query) (boo#1175274)
  * AUCTeX reflects the changes in LaTeX2e 2019-10-01 release.
     'filecontents' environment now takes an optional argument and can
     be used anywhere in a document.  The macros '\Ref' and
     '\labelformat' are moved from 'varioref.sty' to LaTeX kernel.
     amsmath has a new macro '\overunderset'.
  * A new method is implemented in preview-latex to adjust the
    foreground colors of generated images to those of Emacs, when the
    LaTeX command produces PDF.  The traditional method became invalid
    because of the change introduced in Ghostscript 9.27.
    Unfortunately, the new method doesn't work due to a bug in
    Ghostscript 9.27 and is valid only for Ghostscript > 9.27.  There
    is also a fallback method for gs 9.27 users which displays plain
    "black on white" images.  For successful function of preview-latex,
    the users are encouraged to set up the new user option
    'preview-pdf-color-adjust-method' to choose appropriate option
    among the three: new, traditional and fallback method.
  * AUCTeX has support for the Flymake package in Emacs 26 or newer.
    To enable, call 'M-x flymake-mode RET' or add this to your '.emacs'
    file:
         (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'flymake-mode)
  * The way the option 'TeX-record-buffer' is used was corrected.  It
    was used in just the opposite way as the document says.  Erase the
    customization if you have customized this option since it now acts
    in reverse to your expectation.
  * A former customize option 'japanese-TeX-command-list' is removed.
    Use 'japanese-TeX-engine-default', or if it's really necessary,
    customize 'TeX-command-list' directly if the task which the option
    used to carry is required.
  * Support for standard LaTeX without e-TeX extension is now very
    limited.  It doesn't work if raw TeX code is put on the command
    line to invoke latex command.  It also fails for region compilation
    ('C-c C-r' and so on) with documents of non-ascii file name.  In
    addition, it no longer works with preview-latex.  We consider this
    incompatibility is permissible because e-TeX extension is enabled
    for standard LaTeX by default long ago.  LaTeX variants such as
    XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are not affected.
  * Key binds in Texinfo mode are improved.  Typing '$', '^', '_' and
    '\' now just self-inserts without pointless side effects in Texinfo
    mode.
    In addition, the option 'TeX-electric-escape' is now effective in
    Texinfo mode.  When it is enabled, typing '@' will invoke
    'TeX-electric-macro' offering completion in similar style with
    other TeX modes of AUCTeX.
  * Fontification support for 'biblatex' package is improved and
    updated to macros provided by package version 3.12.  For qualified
    lists, at least 2 mandatory arguments are fontified.
  * Support for column specifiers 'w' and 'W' provided by 'array'
    package is added to 'array.el'.  The correct counting of columns
    only works when the 'align' parameter is enclosed in braces, e.g.,
    'w{l}{3cm}'.  The short version 'wl{3cm}' is not supported.
  * Entries for 'PDF Tools' are added in
    'TeX-view-program-list-builtin' for Windows and macOS. This viewer
    can be configured under these operating systems with an entry like
    this in an init file:
         (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "PDF Tools")))
  * Several other bugs were fixed, many minor features were added.
- Drop patches which seem now obsolete
  * utf8-names-3b1ffcd8.patch
  * utf8-names-a8ea1273.patch
  * utf8-names-fix-boo1135326.patch

- Fix the two last upstream commits by adding patch
  utf8-names-fix-boo1135326.patch which is kind of a backport for
  bug boo#1135326

Wed Jul 25 08:47:45 UTC 2018 - werner@suse.de

- Add patches/commits from upstream utf8-names-3b1ffcd8.patch and
  utf8-names-a8ea1273.patch to be able handle files names with
  UTF-8 characters as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 07:56:53 UTC 2018 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 12.1 due bug boo#1088548
  * AUCTeX now requires GNU Emacs 24 or higher.  Support for XEmacs has

  * Besides the change in the supported version of Emacs, there has
    been no functional change in this release, which is equivalent to
    version 11.92.
  * preview-latex is compatible with Ghostscript 9.22 where the
    operator '.runandhide' is removed.  All occurrences of
    '.runandhide' in preview-latex are replaced by alternative code
    making it work with Ghostscript 9.22 again.
  * AUCTeX has a new customize option
    'TeX-math-input-method-off-regexp'.  When you begin to input a math
    formula, the current input method is turned off if its name matches
    this regular expression.
  * The window system focus is pulled back to Emacs when viewing with
    evince-compatible viewers if a new customize option
    'TeX-view-evince-keep-focus' is non-nil.
  * The usual dose of bug fixes was administered.
  * Now AUCTeX has a logo.  The LaTeX code to create it is available in
    the 'etc/' directory of the package.
  * Add support for 'upmendex', an extension of 'makeindex' capable of
    sorting indexes by unicode based ICU.
  * Fix preview-latex to interact correctly with Japanese LaTeX.  The
    parsing routine was made robust not to be confused by the 7-bit
    encoding of Japanese text and the necessary option to LaTeX command
    is kept even when preamble caching is enabled.
  * The new "Glossaries" entry in 'TeX-command-list' runs the command
    'makeglossaries'.
  * Fontification of control symbols has been improved.  Characters
    defined in 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' do not receive
    any fontification.  In DocTeX mode, the character '_' is removed
    from 'font-latex-match-simple-exclude-list' in order to fontify
    macros like '\__module_foo:nnn' correctly.
  * Fontification of math environments has been improved.  Optional
    and/or mandatory argument(s) to environments are not fontified.
  * 'preview.sty' loads 'luatex85.sty' if possible and should be
    compatible with newer luaTeX versions.
  * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-ispell-verb-delimiters'.
    This string contains usual characters used as delimiters for
    in-line verbatim macros like '\verb'.  Text between delimiters
    after an in-line verbatim macro will be skipped during spell
    checking.
  * Fontification of in-line verbatim macros has been improved.
    'font-latex.el' recognizes an optional or a mandatory argument for
    macros like '\Verb' from 'fancyvrb.sty', '\mint' and '\mintinline'
    from 'minted.sty' and fontifies verbatim content correctly.
  * AUCTeX can put and parse labels in optional argument of
    environments.  Inserting labels is done by new function
    'LaTeX-env-label-as-keyval'.  A new customize option
    'LaTeX-listing-label' is available as prefix to labels in code
    typesetting environments, e.g.  'lstlisting' environment provided
    by 'listings' package.  'LaTeX-listing-label' defaults to 'lst:'.
    Parsing of labels for later referencing relies on two requirements:
      1. Label should come as last key-value argument, and
      2. label must be enclosed in braces, e.g.
              \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Some Caption,label={lst:foo}]
              ...
              \end{lstlisting}
  * The function 'LaTeX-label' now takes a second optional argument
    'NO-INSERT'.  When non-'nil', 'LaTeX-label' reads a label and
    returns it as a string.  This argument is also passed to any
    function bound to 'LaTeX-label-function' (see next item).
  * *Incompatible change:* The signature for the function passed with
    the customize option 'LaTeX-label-function' has changed.  The
    function bound to this variable is now expected to take an optional
    second argument 'NO-INSERT'.  When this argument is non-'nil', the
    function should read and only return a label as a string; insertion
    is done by another function.
  * Directory local variables were ineffective for
    'japanese-latex-mode' and 'japanese-plain-tex-mode'.  This bug was
    fixed.  (This was actually done in AUCTeX 11.90, but not
    advertised)
  * The output of Japanese text from Japanese TeX engines is decoded
    correctly for most cases, according to the encoding of the TeX
    documents and the locale.  The difference between MS Windows, macOS
    and unix-like OS is taken into account.  (This was actually done in
    AUCTeX 11.90, but not advertised)
  * Quite a few new LaTeX packages are supported.
  * As usual, many bugs were fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 29 09:00:16 UTC 2017 - werner@suse.de

- Update to 11.90
   * In addition to the completion performed by 'TeX-complete-symbol',
     AUCTeX now also supports the new Emacs standard completion-at-point
     facility (see the Emacs command 'completion-at-point').  This also
     means that modern completion UIs like company-mode work out of the
     box in TeX and LaTeX buffers.
   * Completion is now aware of being inside a math environment and then
     completes math macros.
   * AUCTeX is able to display several levels of super- and subscripts,
     each one raised above and a bit smaller than its basis.  For this
     feature, have a look at the customize options
     'font-latex-fontify-script' (especially the new values
     'multi-level' and 'invisible') and
     'font-latex-fontify-script-max-level'.  Also, the script characters
     '^' and '_' are also fontified with a special face named
     'font-latex-script-char-face'.
   * Parsing of format specification in various tabular environments has
     been improved.  The function 'LaTeX-insert-item' ('C-c <LFD>')
     inserts suitable number of ampersands for '*{num}{cols}'
     constructs.  Style files for LaTeX packages 'tabularx', 'tabulary',
     'longtable', 'dcolumn' and 'siunitx' are adapted to take advantage
     of this improvement.
   * AUCTeX has a new Ispell dictionary 'tex-ispell.el' for macros and
     environments which will be skipped during spell checking.  The
     activiation of this feature is controlled by a new customize option
     'TeX-ispell-extend-skip-list', which is set to 't' and activated by
     default.
   * AUCTeX has a new customize option 'TeX-raise-frame-function' that
     is currently only used by Evince and Atril inverse search to raise
     the Emacs frame.
   * When inserting a new float, AUCTeX will now prompt for a
     short-caption if the length of the caption provided is greater than
     a certain size.  This size is controlled via a new user option
     'LaTeX-short-caption-prompt-length'.
   * Parsing of the compilation log has been reworked.  You should
     encounter fewer mistaken files while navigating through errors and
     warnings.
   * Two new user options, 'TeX-ignore-warnings' and
     'TeX-suppress-ignored-warnings', allow ignoring certain warnings
     after compilation of the document.
   * A new option, 'TeX-PDF-from-DVI', controls if and how to produce a
     PDF file by converting a DVI file.  This supersedes
     'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' which is still recognized but marked as
     obsolete and may be removed in future releases.
   * Support for a number of external viewers has been added
   * A new function, 'TeX-documentation-texdoc', for reading
     documentation with 'texdoc' has been added.  'TeX-doc' is still
     available but now 'C-c ?' runs 'TeX-documentation-texdoc'.
   * AUCTeX has a new custom option
     'LaTeX-reftex-cite-format-auto-activate' which controls the
     automatic activation of citation formats provided by RefTeX when a
     style file is loaded and RefTeX is enabled.  Currently,
     'biblatex.el', 'harvard.el', 'jurabib.el' and 'natbib.el' use this
     feature.  If you have customized 'reftex-cite-format' and want to
     use your settings, you should set this variable to 'nil'.
   * AUCTeX now has limited support for the TikZ package.  For the
     moment, this includes some basic support for prompting the user of
     arguments to the '\draw' macro.
   * The style 'graphicx.el' went through a bigger overhaul.  The
     optional argument of command '\includegraphics' now supports
     key-val query; keys can independently be chosen anytime by pressing
     the <,> key.  As a side effect, the variable
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist' is now no-op and is removed
     from 'tex-style.el'.  You can safely remove any customization of it
     from your init file.  The mandatory argument of '\includegraphics'
     knows about image file extensions supported by the used engine and
     offers them for inclusion.
   * Support for other LaTeX packages was improved, and style files for
     several new packages were added.
   * Many bugs were crushed along the way.
- Remove patch 0001-Fix_bug_in_subfigure_style_filee.patch as now upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 14:20:47 UTC 2016 - werner@suse.de

- Add patch 0001-Fix_bug_in_subfigure_style_filee.patch
  to fix build with GNU Emacs 25.1 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 13 19:25:26 UTC 2015 - auxsvr@gmail.com

- Remove auctex-11.86-dinbrief.dif, as it's been merged upstream, and
  everything in auctex-11.87.dif except for the dvips part (now in
  dvips.patch).  
- Update to 18.89.
  * You can now run all commands needed to compile a document and then
    open the viewer with a single command: 'TeX-command-run-all', bound
    to 'C-c C-a'.
  * Commands such as LaTeX and View can now be executed conveniently on
    the current section (or part, chapter, subsection, etc).  See
    'LaTeX-command-section' and 'LaTeX-command-section-change-level'.
  * Forward and backward search with Evince now also work when only a
    region of the document is compiled/viewed.
  * To open the PDF output file you can now use also PDF Tools, a
    document viewer for Emacs.  With it, as a plus, forward and
    backward search is accurate at word level.
  * With new option 'TeX-PDF-via-dvips-ps2pdf' it is possible to
    compile a document to DVI and then convert it to PDF using
    'dvips'-'ps2pdf' before viewing it.
  * New option 'TeX-file-line-error' allows to select file:line:error
    style for error messages.
  * Indent '\[...\]' math mode as a regular environment by default.
  * Now AUCTeX suggests to run 'makeindex' when appropriate.
  * 'TeX-view-program-list' can contain, as third optional element of
    each item, the name of the executable(s) needed to open the viewer.
  * 'TeX-expand-list' variable has been split into 'TeX-expand-list'
    and 'TeX-expand-list-builtin'.  Only the former is intended to be
    customized by the user, the latter contains built-in expanders.
    You might want to keep in 'TeX-expand-list' only new expansion
    strings.
  * When new option 'TeX-check-engine' is non-nil, before running LaTeX
    commands AUCTeX will check whether the correct engine has been set,
    based upon known restrictions posed by LaTeX packages.
  * Basic support to ConTeXt Mark IV has been added.  Users can now
    select the Mark version to be used with new option
    'ConTeXt-Mark-version', and AUCTeX is able to catch error messages
    in the output log of a Mark IV document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 13 10:50:46 UTC 2015 - auxsvr@gmail.com

- Update to 11.88
  * 'TeX-PDF-mode' is now enabled.
  * 'biblatex' support was greatly expanded.  If parsing is enabled, AUCTeX
     looks at 'backend' option to decide whether to use Biber or BibTeX. The
     'LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber' variable was changed to be file local only
     and is no more customizable.by default.
  * Now you can insert '$...$' or '\(...\)' by typing a single '$'.  To do
    this, customize the new option 'TeX-electric-math'.
    'TeX-math-close-double-dollar' was removed.
  * Brace pairing feature was enhanced in LaTeX documents.  Support for
    '\bigl', '\Bigl', '\biggl' and '\Biggl', the same as the one for
    '\left', was added to 'TeX-insert-macro'.  For example, 'C-c <RET> bigl
    <RET> ( <RET>' inserts '\bigl(\bigr)'.
   * You can insert brace pair '()', '{}' and '[]' by typing a single left
     brace if the new user option 'LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace' is
     enabled.

   * Parsing of LaTeX output was improved.  It is now less likely that
     AUCTeX opens a non-existent file upon calling `TeX-next-error'; a
     problem for example encountered when using MiKTeX 2.8.  In addition
     quoted file names as emitted by MiKTeX are now supported.
   * A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
     implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you
     will have to redo them in this new framework or reenable the old
     one.  See the section on viewers in the manual for details.
   * Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.
   * Support for various LaTeX packages was added, e.g. `tabularx',
     `CJK', and `hyperref'.
   * An easy way to switch between TeX engines (PDFTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX,
     Omega) was added.
   * Support for SyncTeX was added.  This involves the command line
     options for LaTeX and the viewer.
   * Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
     text.
   * `preview.sty' now works with XeTeX.
   * A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.
