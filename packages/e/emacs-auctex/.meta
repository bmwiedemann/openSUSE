<package name="emacs-auctex" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>AUC TeX: An Emacs Extension</title>
  <description>These macros make it easier for you to write TeX documents with GNU
Emacs.	Documentation can be found under:

/usr/share/doc/packages/emacs-auctex/

and in the dvi files math-ref.dvi and tex-ref.dvi (reference cards) and
in the info file auctex in emacs info-mode.

AuC TeX is integrated in XEmacs 19.15 and higher, so these packages may
not be installed concurrently.	Note that the binary formats of the
byte-compiled lisp files of the two emacs editors are incompatible, so
you cannot use this package for XEmacs.</description>
