%description
EAPS provides implementations of the edge addition planar graph
embedding algorithm and related algorithms, including a planar graph
drawing method, an isolator for a minimal subgraph obstructing
planarity in non-planar graphs, outerplanar graph embedder and
obstruction isolator algorithms, and tester/isolator algorithms for
subgraphs homeomorphic to K_{2,3}, K_4, and K_{3,3}.
