  <title>Kernel event states monitoring tool</title>
  <description>Eventstat periodically dumps out the current kernel event state.It keeps track
of current events and outputs the change in events on each output update.
The tool requires sudo to run since it needs to write to /proc/timer_stats to
start and stop the event monitoring.
