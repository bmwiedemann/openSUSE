  <description>Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) is an open source initiative to create standard
APIs, implementations of those APIs, and technology compatibility kits for Java
runtimes that enable development, deployment, and management of server-side and
cloud-native applications.

EE4J is based on the Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) standards,
and uses Java EE 8 as the baseline for creating new standards.
