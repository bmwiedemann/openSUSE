  <title>Recovery tool for ext4 and ext3 filesystems</title>
  <description>extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4 partition. extundelete uses the information stored in the partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that has been deleted from the partition. There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place after recovering your files!
