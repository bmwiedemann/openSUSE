%description
The Legend of Edgar is a platform game, not unlike those found on the Amiga and
SNES. Edgar must battle his way across the world, solving puzzles and defeating
powerful enemies to achieve his quest.

A 2D platform game with a persistent world.
When Edgar's father fails to return home after venturing out one dark and stormy
night, Edgar fears the worst: he has been captured by the evil sorcerer who
lives in a fortress beyond the forbidden swamp.

Donning his armour, Edgar sets off to rescue him, but his quest will not be
easy...
