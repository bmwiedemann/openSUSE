  <title>A Tool for Automating Interactive Programs</title>
  <description>Expect is a tool primarily for automating interactive applications,
such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, and more.  Expect
really makes this stuff trivial.  Expect is also useful for testing
these applications.  It is described in many books, articles, papers,
and FAQs.  There is an entire book on it available from O'Reilly.</description>
