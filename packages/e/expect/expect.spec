%description
Expect is a tool primarily for automating interactive applications,
such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, and more.  Expect
really makes this stuff trivial.  Expect is also useful for testing
these applications.  It is described in many books, articles, papers,
and FAQs.  There is an entire book on it available from O'Reilly.

%description devel
This package contains header files and documentation needed for linking
to expect from programs written in compiled languages like C, C++, etc.

This package is not needed for developing scripts that run under the
/usr/bin/expect interpreter, or any other Tcl interpreter with the
expect package loaded.
