    <comment>- added webpage for source tarballs to specfile

- Throw out ancient specfile constructs like BuildRoot and
  defattr that have had proper defaults for long. Use more of the
  contemporary macros, and drop all the nonstandard CFLAGS/LDFLAGS,
  drop the unconditional strip calls.

- added missing copyright to specfile 

- tried to address checkin policy issues for factory

- First build. Version - 1.1.7</comment>
