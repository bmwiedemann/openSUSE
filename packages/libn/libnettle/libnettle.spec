%description
Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.

Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.

The libhogweed library contains public key algorithms to use with libnettle.

%description -n nettle
Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.

This package contains a few command-line tools to perform cryptographic
operations using the nettle library.

# the hmac hashes:
#
# this is a hack that re-defines the __os_install_post macro
# for a simple reason: the macro strips the binaries and thereby
# invalidates a HMAC that may have been created earlier.
# solution: create the hashes _after_ the macro runs.
#
# this shows up earlier because otherwise the %%expand of
# the macro is too late.
# remark: This is the same as running
#   openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac 'orboDeJITITejsirpADONivirpUkvarP'
