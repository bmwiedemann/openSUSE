Mon Jun 17 06:22:31 UTC 2024 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.10:
  * Bug fixes:
    - Add missing hash functions sha512_224 and sha512_256 to the
      nettle_get_hashes() list. The name values in the
      corresponding nettle_hash structs also changed to use
      underscore instead of dash, for consistency.
    - Fix a few cases of formally undefined calls to memcpy(dst,
      NULL, 0), resulting from valid calls to, e.g.,
      sha256_update(ctx, 0, NULL).
  * New features:
    - Support RSA-OAEP encryption. Contributed by Nicolas Mora and Daiki Ueno.
    - New function sha3_256_shake_output, new functions
      sha3_128_init, sha3_128_update, sha3_128_shake,
      sha3_128_shake_output. Contributed by Daiki Ueno.
    - Added DRBG-CTR with AES256, contributed by Simon Josefsson.
  * Optimizations:
    - New combined gcm-aes assembly for powerpc64, contributed by Danny Tsen.
    - New sha256 assembly for powerpc64, contributed by Eric Richter.
    - Improved performance for powerpc64 AES decrypt, by skipping
      subkey transformations that don't suit the vncipher instructions.
    - Add arm64 CPU feature detection for Android and for Apple systems,
      contributed by Foolbar and Tim Kosse, prespectively.
  * Miscellaneous:
    - New tests for side-channel silence, based on valgrind.
    - Delete all md5 assembly code. Delete all sparc32 assembly code.

  * Fix bug in the new OCB code may be exploitable for denial of
    service or worse due to memory corruption

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 15 19:20:37 UTC 2023 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 3.9
  * rewrite of the C and plain x86_64 assembly implementations of
    GHASH to use precomputed tables in a different way, with tables
    always accessed in the same sequential manner. This should make
    Nettle's GHASH implementation side-channel silent on all
    platforms, but considerably slower on platforms without carry-
    less mul instructions. E.g., benchmarks of the C implementation
    on x86_64 showed a slowdown of 3 times.
  * Fix bug in ecdsa and gostdsa signature verify operation, for
    the unlikely corner case that point addition really is point
    duplication.
  * Fix for chacha on Power7, nettle's assembly used an instruction
    only available on later processors
  * Add support for the SM4 block cipher
  * Add support for the Balloon password hash
  * Add support for SIV-GCM authenticated encryption mode
  * Add support for OCB authenticated encryption mode.
  * New exported functions md5_compress, sha1_compress,
    sha256_compress, sha512_compress
  * multiple performance optimizations
  * Delete all arcfour assembly code. Affects 32-bit x86, 32-bit
    and 64-bit sparc

Thu Jul 28 20:25:53 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.8.1:
  * Avoid non-posix m4 argument references in the chacha
    implementation for arm64, powerpc64 and s390x. Reported by
    Christian Weisgerber, fix contributed by Mamone Tarsha.
  * Use explicit .machine pseudo-ops where needed in s390x
    assembly files. Bug report by Andreas K. Huettel, fix
    contributed by Mamone Tarsha.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 11 19:22:12 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 3.8:
  This release includes a couple of new features, and many
  performance improvements. It adds assembly code for two more
  architectures: ARM64 and S390x.

  The new version is intended to be fully source and binary
  compatible with Nettle-3.6. The shared library names are
  libnettle.so.8.5 and libhogweed.so.6.5, with sonames
  libnettle.so.8 and libhogweed.so.6.

  New features:

  * AES keywrap (RFC 3394), contributed by Nicolas Mora.

  * SM3 hash function, contributed by Tianjia Zhang.

  * New functions cbc_aes128_encrypt, cbc_aes192_encrypt,
    cbc_aes256_encrypt.

    On processors where AES is fast enough, e.g., x86_64 with
    aesni instructions, the overhead of using Nettle's general
    cbc_encrypt can be significant. The new functions can be
    implemented in assembly, to do multiple blocks with reduced
    per-block overhead.

    Note that there's no corresponding new decrypt functions,
    since the general cbc_decrypt doesn't suffer from the same
    performance problem.

  Bug fixes:

  * Fix fat builds for x86_64 windows, these appear to never
    have worked.

  Optimizations:

  * New ARM64 implementation of AES, GCM, Chacha, SHA1 and
    SHA256, for processors supporting crypto extensions. Great
    speedups, and fat builds are supported. Contributed by
    Mamone Tarsha.

  * New s390x implementation of AES, GCM, Chacha, memxor, SHA1,
    SHA256, SHA512 and SHA3. Great speedups, and fat builds are
    supported. Contributed by Mamone Tarsha.

  * New PPC64 assembly for ecc modulo/redc operations,
    contributed by Amitay Isaacs, Martin Schwenke and Alastair
    D´Silva.

  * The x86_64 AES implementation using aesni instructions has
    been reorganized with one separate function per key size,
    each interleaving the processing of two blocks at a time
    (when the caller processes multiple blocks with each call).
    This gives a modest performance improvement on some
    processors.

  * Rewritten and faster x86_64 poly1305 assembly.

- GNU Nettle 3.7.3: [CVE-2021-3580, bsc#1187060]
  * Fix crash for zero input to rsa_sec_decrypt and
    rsa_decrypt_tr. Potential denial of service vector.
  * Ensure that all of rsa_decrypt_tr and rsa_sec_decrypt return
    failure for out of range inputs, instead of either crashing,
    or silently reducing input modulo n. Potential denial of
    service vector.
  * Ensure that rsa_decrypt returns failure for out of range
    inputs, instead of silently reducing input modulo n.
  * Ensure that rsa_sec_decrypt returns failure if the message
    size is too large for the given key. Unlike the other bugs,
    this would typically be triggered by invalid local
    configuration, rather than by processing untrusted remote
    data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 21 10:17:35 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU Nettle 3.7.2:
  * fix a bug in ECDSA signature verification that could lead to a
    denial of service attack (via an assertion failure) or possibly
    incorrect results (CVE-2021-20305, boo#1184401)
  * fix a few related problems where scalars are required to be 
    canonically reduced modulo the ECC group order, but in fact may
    be slightly larger

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 09:24:00 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

  * Support for Curve448 and ED448 signatures
  * Support for SHAKE256, SIV-CMAC, CMAC64, "CryptoPro" variant of
    the GOST hash (as gosthash94cp), GOST DSA signatures, including
    GOST curves gc256b and gc512a
  * Support for Intel CET in x86 and x86_64 assembly files, if
    enabled via CFLAGS (gcc --fcf-protection=full)
  * A few new functions to improve support for the Chacha
    variant with 96-bit nonce and 32-bit block counter (the
    existing functions use nonce and counter of 64-bit each),
    and functions to set the counter.
  * New interface, struct nettle_mac, for MAC (message
    authentication code) algorithms. This abstraction is only
    for MACs that don't require a per-message nonce. For HMAC,
    the key size is fixed, and equal the digest size of the
    underlying hash function
  * multiple bug fixes
- drop nettle-respect-cflags.patch
- silence packaging warning raised by HMAC files

  * Support for XTS mode
  * various improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  2 13:48:54 UTC 2019 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 3.4.1 release
  * Fix CVE-2018-16869 (bsc#1118086)
    All functions using RSA private keys are now side-channel
    silent, meaning that they try hard to avoid any branches or
    memory accesses depending on secret data. This applies both to
    the bignum calculations, which now use GMP's mpn_sec_* family
    of functions, and the processing of PKCS#1 padding needed for
    RSA decryption.
  * Changes in behavior:
    The functions rsa_decrypt and rsa_decrypt_tr may now clobber
    all of the provided message buffer, independent of the
    actual message length. They are side-channel silent, in that
    branches and memory accesses don't depend on the validity or
    length of the message. Side-channel leakage from the
    caller's use of length and return value may still provide an
    oracle useable for a Bleichenbacher-style chosen ciphertext
    attack. Which is why the new function rsa_sec_decrypt is
    recommended.
  * New features:
    A new function rsa_sec_decrypt.
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fix bug in pkcs1-conv, missing break statements in the
      parsing of PEM input files.
    - Fix link error on the pss-mgf1-test test, affecting builds
      without public key support.

- libnettle 3.4.1rc1: [bsc#1118086, CVE-2018-16869]
  * pkcs1-decrypt.c (pkcs1_decrypt): Rewrite as a wrapper around
    _pkcs1_sec_decrypt_variable. Improves side-channel silence of the
    only caller, rsa_decrypt.
  * rsa-sec-compute-root.c (sec_mul, sec_mod_mul, sec_powm): New
    local helper functions, with their own itch functions.
    (_rsa_sec_compute_root_itch, _rsa_sec_compute_root): Rewrote to
    use helpers, for clarity.
  * rsa-decrypt-tr.c (rsa_decrypt_tr): Use NETTLE_OCTET_SIZE_TO_LIMB_SIZE.
  * rsa-sec-compute-root.c (_rsa_sec_compute_root): Avoid calls to
    mpz_sizeinbase, since that potentially leaks most significant bits
    of private key parameters a and b.
  * rsa-sign.c (rsa_compute_root) [!NETTLE_USE_MINI_GMP]: Use
    _rsa_sec_compute_root.
  * testsuite/rsa-sec-compute-root-test.c: Add more tests for new
    side-channel silent functions.
  * rsa-sign.c (rsa_private_key_prepare): Check that qn + cn >= pn,
    since that is required for one of the GMP calls in
    _rsa_sec_compute_root.
  * rsa-decrypt-tr.c: Switch to use side-channel silent functions.
  * pkcs1-sec-decrypt.c (_pkcs1_sec_decrypt_variable): New private
    function. Variable size version for backwards compatibility.
  * testsuite/rsa-sec-decrypt-test.c: Adds more tests.
  * rsa-sec-decrypt.c (rsa_sec_decrypt): New function.
    Fixed length side-channel silent version of rsa-decrypt.
  * testsuite/rsa-encrypt-test.c: add tests for the new fucntion.
  * testsuite/pkcs1-sec-decrypt-test.c: Adds tests for _pkcs1_sec_decrypt.
  * gmp-glue.c (mpn_get_base256): New function.
  * pkcs1-sec-decrypt.c (_pkcs1_sec_decrypt): New private function.
    Fixed length side-channel silent version of pkcs1-decrypt.
  * cnd-memcpy.c (cnd_memcpy): New function.
  * testsuite/cnd-memcpy-test.c: New test case.
  * rsa-sign-tr.c (rsa_sec_compute_root_tr): New function that uses
    _rsa_sec_compute_root, as well as side-channel silent RSA blinding.
    (rsa_compute_root_tr) Rewritten as a wrapper around	rsa_sec_compute_root_tr.
    (rsa_sec_blind, rsa_sec_unblind, sec_equal, rsa_sec_check_root)
    (cnd_mpn_zero): New helper functions.
    (rsa_sec_compute_root_tr) [NETTLE_USE_MINI_GMP]: Defined as a not
    side-channel silent wrapper around rsa_compute_root_tr, and the
    latter function left unchanged.
  * rsa-sec-compute-root.c (_rsa_sec_compute_root_itch)
    (_rsa_sec_compute_root): New file, new private functions.
    Side-channel silent version of rsa_compute_root.
  * rsa-internal.h: New header file with declarations.
  * gmp-glue.h (NETTLE_OCTET_SIZE_TO_LIMB_SIZE): New macro.
  * tools/pkcs1-conv.c (convert_file): Add missing break statements.
  * nettle-internal.c (des_set_key_wrapper, des3_set_key_wrapper)
    (blowfish128_set_key_wrapper): Wrapper functions, to avoid cast
    between incompatible function types (which gcc-8 warns about).
    Wrappers are expected to compile to a single jmp instruction.
  * des-compat.c (des_compat_des3_decrypt): Change length argument type to size_t.

- libnettle 3.4:
  * Fixed an improper use of GMP mpn_mul, breaking curve2559 and
    eddsa on certain platforms
  * Fixed memory leak when handling invalid signatures in 
    ecdsa_verify. Fix contributed by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos.
  * Reorganized the way certain data items are made available:
    Nettle header files now define the symbols
    nettle_hashes, nettle_ciphers, and nettle_aeads, as
    preprocessor macros invoking a corresponding accessor
    function. For backwards ABI compatibility, the symbols are
    still present in the compiled libraries, and with the same
    sizes as in nettle-3.3.
  * Support for RSA-PSS signatures
  * Support for the HKDF key derivation function, defined by RFC
    5869
  * Support for the Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)
  * New accessor functions: nettle_get_hashes,
    nettle_get_ciphers, nettle_get_aeads, nettle_get_secp_192r1,
    nettle_get_secp_224r1, nettle_get_secp_256r1,
    nettle_get_secp_384r1, nettle_get_secp_521r1.
    Direct access to data items is deprecated going forward.    
  * The base16 and base64 functions now use the type char * for
    ascii data, rather than uint8_t *. This eliminates the last
    pointer-signedness warnings when building Nettle
  * The contents of the header file nettle/version.h is now
    architecture independent, except in --enable-mini-gmp
  * Prevent data sizes from leaking into the ABI

- libnettle 3.3:
  * Invalid private RSA keys, with an even modulo, are now
    rejected by rsa_private_key_prepare. (Earlier versions
    allowed such keys, even if results of using them were bogus).
    Nettle applications are required to call
    rsa_private_key_prepare and check the return value, before
    using any other RSA private key functions; failing to do so
    may result in crashes for invalid private keys.
  * Ignore bit 255 of the x coordinate of the input point to
    curve25519_mul, as required by RFC 7748. To differentiate at
    compile time, curve25519.h defines the constant
    NETTLE_CURVE25519_RFC7748.
  * RSA and DSA now use side-channel silent modular
    exponentiation, to defend against attacks on the private key
    from evil processes sharing the same processor cache. This
    attack scenario is of particular relevance when running an
    HTTPS server on a virtual machine, where you don't know who
    you share the cache hardware with.
    bsc#991464 CVE-2016-6489
  * Fix sexp-conv crashes on invalid input
  * Fix out-of-bounds read in des_weak_p
  * Fix a couple of formally undefined shift operations
  * Fix compilation with c89
  * New function memeql_sec, for side-channel silent comparison
    of two memory areas.
  * Building the public key support of nettle now requires GMP

  * Support for the GOST R 34.11-94 hash algorithm
  * Support for SHA3
  * Support for PKCS #5 PBKDF2
  * Fixed a small memory leak in nettle_realloc and
    nettle_xrealloc.
  * x86_64 assembly for SHA256, SHA512, and SHA3
  * ARM assembly code for several additional algorithms,
    including AES, Salsa20, and the SHA family of hash
    functions.
  * Support for 12-round salsa20, "salsa20r12", as specified by
    eSTREAM.
  * Support for UMAC, including x86_64 and ARM assembly.
  * Support for ECDSA signatures. Elliptic curve operations over
    the following curves: secp192r1, secp224r1, secp256r1,
    secp384r1 and secp521r1, including x86_64 and ARM assembly
    for the most important primitives.
- Depend on makeinfo for info file generation.
- Don't disable static libs, they are needed at build time.

- upgrade to 2.5:
  * removed some internal undocumented functions
  * pkcs1_signature_prefix renamed to _pkcs1_signature_prefix
    with slightly different behavior
  * nettle-internal.c is no longer included
  * Support for the salsa20 block cipher
  * Tentative interface for timing-resistant RSA functions
  * A more general interface for PKCS#1 signatures
  * Documentation, example programs for the base16 and base64
  * Use an additional table to avoid GF2^8 multiplications in
    aes_invert_key (mainly used by aes_set_decrypt_key). Also
    tabulate round constants in aes_set_encrypt_key.
- configure --enable-shared now default, no longer required
