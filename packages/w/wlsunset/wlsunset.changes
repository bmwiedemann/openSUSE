- Update to version 0.4.0:
  This release works around an issue where the compositor gives
  a zero gamma size, and adds support for toggling forced modes
  with SIGUSR1. Support for xdg_output is also removed, as newer
  versions of wl_output contain the necessary output name.
  * Force mode on SIGUSR1
  * Change steps from 25K to 10K
  * Calculate blend factor as double
  * Remove xdg-output support
  * Improve logging
  * Free output name, skip storing description
  * Explain the use of multiple locus better
  * readme: Fix the list of forced modes
  * Recreate controls on next set if gamma size is zero
  * Fix typo in manpage
