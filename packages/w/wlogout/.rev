    <comment>Hello,
I want to introduce a new package to factory:

wlogout is a wayland based logout menu
https://github.com/ArtsyMacaw/wlogout

It is useful for wayland based window managers like hyprland and sway, where no power menu is provided by default.
Therefore it would be important to have the package available in the main repos.

Thank you,
