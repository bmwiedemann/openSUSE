- Update to release 3.6
  * A bug was fixed with sidedef packing where if multiple
    scrolling walls would share a sidedef, those walls would scroll
    at the wrong speed. This has been fixed in a generic way that
    should also cover other potential bugs related to animated
    walls.
  * Compression of Hexen format levels is now supported.
  * PSX/Doom 64 format levels are now handled correctly.
  * There is now a `-q` command line option to suppress normal
    output.
  * Static limits on the number of lumps in a WAD and the number of
    sidedefs in a level have been removed.
  * This release adds support for BLOCKMAP lump compression.
  * Two new arguments, `-extblocks` and `-extsides`, have been
    added to allow use of the extended blockmap and sidedef limits
    that are supported by some source ports.
  * The list command (-l) no longer hides level sub-lumps like
    BLOCKMAP or SIDEDEFS. The full set of lumps is always listed.
