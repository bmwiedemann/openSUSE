- Update to release 3.8
  * The -u ("uncompress") option was renamed to -d ("decompress",
    the usual terminology used by almost every other compression
    tool).
  * A special sector tag range (9700-9799) is now recognized for
    special effects. There are some cases where level authors may
    deliberately want sidedefs to be merged even when they are
    attached to special lines, and this allows that.

- Update to release 3.7
  * A new option, -wipesides, cleans upper and lower textures from
    one-sided lines where they are not used. This allows some
    sidedefs to be merged that would not otherwise be merged.
  * Textures are now compared in a case-insensitive manner,
    matching the logic of Doom itself. This won't make a lot of
    difference since most editors store texture names in allcaps,
    but there may be corner-case WADs where it helps improve
    compression slightly.
  * The progress counter now uses wall time instead of CPU time.

- Update to release 3.6
  * A bug was fixed with sidedef packing where if multiple
    scrolling walls would share a sidedef, those walls would scroll
    at the wrong speed. This has been fixed in a generic way that
    should also cover other potential bugs related to animated
    walls.
  * Compression of Hexen format levels is now supported.
  * PSX/Doom 64 format levels are now handled correctly.
  * There is now a `-q` command line option to suppress normal
    output.
  * Static limits on the number of lumps in a WAD and the number of
    sidedefs in a level have been removed.
  * This release adds support for BLOCKMAP lump compression.
  * Two new arguments, `-extblocks` and `-extsides`, have been
    added to allow use of the extended blockmap and sidedef limits
    that are supported by some source ports.
  * The list command (-l) no longer hides level sub-lumps like
    BLOCKMAP or SIDEDEFS. The full set of lumps is always listed.
