  <title>Redundancy compressor for Doom WAD files</title>
  <description>WADptr is a utility for reducing the size of Doom WAD files. The
&quot;compressed&quot; WADs will still work the same as the originals. The
program works by exploiting the WAD file format to combine repeated /
redundant material.</description>
