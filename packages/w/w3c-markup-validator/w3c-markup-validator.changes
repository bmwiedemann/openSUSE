    working draft, XHTML+RDFa 1.1 20120131 working draft, 
    and VoiceXML 2.0 and 2.1.
  * Enhancement: update EARL/RDF output to 1.0 20110510 working draft.
  * Enhancement: removed internal support for the deprecated 
    /check/referer path, implement it and some uri=referer cases in 
    httpd.conf instead for better efficiency.
  * Enhancement: work around HTML::Template 2.10 versioning issue.
  * Enhancement: documentation improvements, code and server error 
    log warning cleanups.
  * Enhancement: the sample "badge" code for applicable document 
    types now includes a JavaScript onclick handler that avoids 
    the need for uri=referer redirects in many usual scenarios.
  * Enhancement: make XML-LibXML XML catalog setup work with mod_perl.
  * Bug fix: fix transcode error parsing for single-line documents.
  * Bug fix: better treatment of HTML5 documents that contain xmlns.
  * Bug fix: better treatment of direct input HTML5 documents that 
    contain a non-UTF-8 charset indication.

  * limited support for IRI's. 
  * several updates to validator's internal DTD library and catalog

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 19 13:40:06 CEST 2010 - pgajdos@suse.cz

- updated to version 1.1:
    * Enhancement: XML wellformedness check is now run only if 
      other stages of the validation process report no errors. 
      This is to further mitigate a performance issue related 
      to the XML wellformedness check.
    * Enhancement: improved error output performance.
    * Enhancement: error/warning location information now 
      makes it clearer whether the error occurred in the validated 
       document or an external resource related to it.
    * Enhancement: improved heuristics for incomplete input URLs.
    * … and as usual, assorted minor spelling, code cleanup, link 
      and the like fixes.
- changes in version 1.0:
    * Enhancement: when passing its internal transcoded document 
      to external validators, validator now reflects the 
      transcoding by modifying character encoding information 
      included in the passed document.
    * Enhancement: updates to validator's internal DTD library.
    * Enhancement: XML wellformedness check now supports external 
      entities instead of just suppressing error messages about 
      them internally. As a side effect, this should work around 
      a specific case of a certain performance problem with 
      XML::LibXML 1.70.
    * Bug fix: doctype override could place a malformed comment 
      in the modified document.
    * Bug fix: error messages were not properly HTML escaped when 
      "show source" was selected.
    * Dependency changes: new minimum required versions: 
      HTML-Parser 3.60, XML-LibXML 1.70.
    * … and a whole slew of minor spelling, code cleanup, link 
     and the like fixes here and there.

- 0.8.5 release:
  The 0.8.5 release of the markup validator is a feature and bugfix
  release. Changes include:
  - UI fix: many of our users were confused by the behaviour of the
    "More options" arrow. A small UI change should make the user
    experience less confusing.
  - New Feature: fuzzy matching used to suggest corrected markup.
    Analysis of many invalid pages shows that the most common error
    comes from invalid (typo or non standard) elements and attributes
    used. The new feature
    (http://www.w3.org/blog/systeam/2009/02/16/validator_fuzzy_match)
    will help by suggesting possible (valid) alternatives.
  - Bug Fix: issues with SVG
    (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6524)
    were creating very large log output when validating SVG documents.
    The validator code has been amended to limit this log flood.
  - Bug Fix: the HTML5 validator integration broke some of the
    validator's “document type override” functionalities in version
    0.8.4. This is fixed in 0.8.5.
  - New: the validator icon code, which one can add to web pages,
    now includes XHTML+RDFa
    (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=65252)
    when applicable.
  - Bug Fix / New: implementing XML::LibXML Structured Errors
    (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6329).
    The validator uses libxml2 and the XML::LibXML for well-formedness
    check. Recent versions of the perl library had bugs that made in
    backard-incompatible, causing the validator to not output all
    well-formedness errors reliably. Some code was added to the
    validator to work with all future versions of that library,
    but we recommend not using XML::LibXML between versions
    1.67 and 1.69 inclusive
    (see how (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6329#c15)).
  - Experimental: validation of SVG documents is now passed to the
    validator.nu engine. At the time of this release, neither
    validator.nu nor the DTD engine previously used are perfect for
    the validation of SVG, but the technologies used in the
    validator.nu engine (nvdl and relaxNG) makes it more promising.
  - UI Fix: accessibility improvements for screen readers.
  - Documentation: updated the Why Validate? (docs/why.html) document.
  - Usability: the way in which the validator has to handle direct
    input and character encodings
    (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6259)
    has long been confusing to many. Improvements have been made
    that explain in clearer ways what
    the validator does.
  - New: the validator now recommends to declare character encoding
    in the document itself, especially if there is a chance that the
    document will be read from or saved to disk, CD, etc -
    in accordance with internationalization recommendations
    (http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/#Slide0250).

- 0.8.4 release:
  0.8.4 may sound like a very minor step from the version 0.8.3
  released in August, but this new release of the W3C Markup Validator
  brings some very important change:
  in addition to checking documents against etablished standards such
  as HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, the validator can now check documents
  for conformance to HTML5 (http://www.w3.org/html/), thanks to the
  integration with the Validator.nu (http://about.validator.nu/)
  html5 engine.
  HTML5 is still work in progress and support for this next generation
  of the publishing language of the World Wide Web will remain
  experimental, but this integration should provide experimentation
  grounds for those interested in trying on authoring in this new
  version of html, as well as a feedback channel for the group
  working on building a stable, open standard.
  Other bug fixes and improvement in this version include:
  - Bug Fix: version 0.8.3 came with a programming mistake that would
    not affect validation, but would flood the validator servers'
    logs with warnings.
  - Bug Fix - Document type support. A Typo in the machine-readable
    grammar published with the latest specification for XHTML1.1
    caused spurrious validation errors when checking documents
    against XHTML1.1. Fixing the typo
    (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Nov/0029.html)
    solves the issue. Another fixed typo
    (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Aug/0018.html)
    now makes the validation against the historical
    HTML i18n document type functional.
  - Documentation updates and fixes: the installation documentation
    used a misspelled option for the installation of the OpenSP
    parser. The correction should make installation of the validator
    a little easier. Also relevant to installing the validator, the
    sample validator configuration now includes a documentation of
    environment variables
    (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-cvs/2008Nov/0008.html)
    affecting connectivity.

- Update validator and sgml-libs to stable release version 0.8.3:
  The 0.8.3 release of the W3C Markup Validator is a bug fix release,
  with a few small additional features.
  Changes include:
  - Bug Fix: in version 0.8.2, revalidation of an uploaded file was
    broken (missing markup in the HTML form)
  - Updates: Added support for XHTML Basic 1.1, XHTML Mobile Profiles
    (1.0, 1.1 and 1.2) and the historical HTML i18n
  - Bug Fix: the validator won't override a given document type with
    itself
  - Conformance: The validator now warns about inconsistent
    public/system identifiers combinations
  - API: The custom HTTP headers in validator responses now also
    include the number of warnings
  - Experimental Feature: added the new option to send specific
    'Accept-Charset' and 'User-Agent' headers, in addition to
    'Accept' and 'Accept-Language' in version 0.8.2.
  - Experimental Feature: the validator can output its results
    as JSON.
  - Documentation: Some documentation updates
  - Development: New automated support and regression test suite

- Update validator and sgml-libs to stable release version 0.8.2:
  The 0.8.2 release of the W3C Markup Validator is a bug fix,
  performance and usability release, addressing the following issues:
  - Bug Fix: processing of documents through HTML Tidy would be
    triggered even when not requested.
    The fix should provide a noticeable performance boost.
  - Bug Fix: forcing or overriding the Doctype declaration would
    not work with documents using an XML Declaration Bug 857 -
    DOCTYPE Override should take XML Decl into account,
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=857).
    The fix should make it much easier to validate e.g. SVG documents.
  - Bug Fix: Making sure that the validator requests a fresh version
    of the online resources, when an older cached version could be
    returned. (Bug 4998 - Validator sometimes uses cached content
    (cache-control header on requests would be useful),
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=4998).
  - Usability: when using file upload or direct input modes, the
    result page will now include a text area filled with the
    validated source, for easy fixing and revalidation
    (Bug 4342 - Revalidation form for Upload and Direct Input,
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=4342).
  - Accessibility: the main interface was made friendlier to
    screen readers (Bug 4959 - screen reader reads contents of
    entire form, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=4959).
  - Experimental Feature: new options were added to trigger Format
    (http://validator.w3.org/docs/users.html#option-accept)
    and Language negotiation
    (http://validator.w3.org/docs/users.html#option-accept-language).
  - New Feature: automatic detection of the document type for SVG
    documents, even without a DOCTYPE declaration.
    Validation of SVG only supported for standalone SVG documents,
    up to SVG 1.1.
  - Documentation updates.

- Update validator and sgml-libs to stable release version 0.8.1:
  The 0.8.1 release of the W3C Markup Validator is a bug fix
  release, addressing the following issues:
  - Bug Fix: changed set up of parser responsible for checking XML 
    well-formedness, which would retrieve schemas for entities 
    each time the validator would run.
  - Bug Fix: the validator would incorrectly complain about HTML/XML 
    named entities (such as ©).
  - Bug Fix: fixing referer checking 
    when running with Apache and mod_perl2.
  - Bug Fix: the validator would crash when called from browsers
    with rare language preference settings
  - ... and small performance and code cleanup fixes.
