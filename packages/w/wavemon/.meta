  <title>An ncurses monitoring application for wireless network devices</title>
  <description>wavemon is a wireless device monitoring application that allows you to
watch signal and noise levels, packet statistics, device configuration
and network parameters of your wireless network hardware. It has
currently only been tested with the Lucent Orinoco series of cards,
although it *should* work (though with varying features) with all
devices supported by the wireless kernel extensions by Jean Tourrilhes.</description>
