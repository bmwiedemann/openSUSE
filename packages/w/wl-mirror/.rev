    <comment>Hello,
I want to introduce a new package to factory:

wl-mirror is a Wayland output mirror client.
It mirrors (in the sense of copying, not swapping leftâ†”right) an output onto a new resizable window.
https://github.com/Ferdi265/wl-mirror

It is useful for wayland based window managers like hyprland and sway, where no screen mirroring utility is provided by default.
Therefore it would be important to have the package available in the main repos.</comment>
