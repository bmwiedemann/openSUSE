 This version by va3db db@db.net db@FreeBSD.org Oct 1 2007
 rewritten completely. There were equator crossing bugs in the original
 (dead) version of wwl on sunsite, so I rewrote it from scratch.

 wwl     -- Originally by IK0ZSN Mirko Caserta <ik0zsn@amsat.org>
 locator -- originally written by Harald M.
 Stauss harald.stauss@web.de DO1JHS @ DB0GR.#BLN.DEU.EU
 There is no code from the original (dead?) version of wwl or
 the original (dead?) version of locator in this version.

 The bearing/distance code is from Amateur Radio Software by John
 Morris, GM4ANB.
