Subject: [PATCH] Fix docs generation for datetime with doxygen 1.11.0
References: https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/pull/24814

It seems that as of the below commit, doxygen changed its handling of
parsing backticks in comments such that it now fails to properly
generate documentation for the entire datetime.h file.  Fix this by
closing the open backtick.

Also update the actual, non-documentation, header to match for
consistency, even if non-matching backticks are not a problem there.

See: https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/commit/f18767307be20ca8d2ca81f74cc1f3446205282b

Closes #24814.
