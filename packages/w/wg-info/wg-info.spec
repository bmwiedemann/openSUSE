%description
Better wireguard status script

This script allows you to actually know, which peer in the `wg show` output is which by assigning them a name.
Also you can see, which peers are actually online as `wg-info` will ping them and set the color (red/green) accordingly.
To save time, this is done for all the peers in parallel.

The output is colored (if writing to a tty or explicitly requested) using terminal sequences, HTML or be just plain text.
