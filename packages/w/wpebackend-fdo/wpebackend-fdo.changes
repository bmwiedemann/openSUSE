- Update to version 1.8.0:
  + Added new API for the audio rendering protocol, which allows
    embedders to receive audio samples instead of letting WPE
    WebKit handle their playback.
  + Added support to export frames using EGLStreams, which can be
    used e.g.  with Nvidia GPUs.
  + New build configuration system based on Meson. The existing
    CMake-based system is still maintained, and both produce the
    same outputs.
  + Use libepoxy for EGL operations.
- Switch to meson.
- Add epoxy to BuildRequires: new dependency.

- Update to version 1.6.1:
  + Fixed build when using EGL stacks with odd EGLNativeDisplay
    definitions.
  + Fixed version retrieval functions not being exposed as public
    symbols.
  + Improve build configuration by instructing CMake to report
    mismatched versions of dependency libraries, instead of failing
    to compile.

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  + Added support for the DMA-BUF video plane display protocol.
  + Added support for exporting DMA-BUF buffers.
  + Added support for exporting SHM-based buffers.
  + Fix building the documentation.
  + Ensure that only symbols marked as public are exported.
- Add explicit pkgconfig(wayland-client) and
  pkgconfig(wayland-server) BuildRequires: cmake checks for them.
- Pass explicit -DWayland_VERSION_HEADER_PATH=$(pkg-config
  --variable=includedir wayland-client) to cmake, let cmake find
  our wayland headers properly.
