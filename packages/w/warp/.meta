  <title>App to securely send files via the internet or local network</title>
  <description>Warp allows you to securely send files to each other via the internet or local
network by exchanging a word-based code.

The best transfer method will be determined using the &quot;Magic Wormhole&quot; protocol
which includes local network transfer if possible.
