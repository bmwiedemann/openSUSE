%description
Weave Net creates a virtual network that connects containers across multiple
hosts and enables their automatic discovery. With Weave Net, portable
microservices-based applications consisting of multiple containers can run
anywhere: on one host, multiple hosts or even across cloud providers and data
centers. Applications use the network just as if the containers were all plugged
into the same network switch, without having to configure port mappings,
ambassadors or links.
