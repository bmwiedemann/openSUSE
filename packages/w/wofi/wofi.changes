Fri Aug  8 06:37:03 UTC 2025 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- update to 1.5.1:
  * dmenu mode will now auto-close with status 0 if no entries are provided and
    custom entry is not allowed
  * Added the API function wofi_no_custom_entry()
  * update_surface_size() no longer performs a resize if width or height is 0
  * Create a `strict-contains` matching mode for a more obvious sort order.
  * Added {} to close_on_focus_loss if statement
  * add close_on_focus_loss optionfor wofi to close when it loses focus
  * Add CLI option to hide the search bar
  * fix: Call update_surface_size() inside hide_search_first()
  * Added drun-ignore_metadata
  * iswlower() and iswupper() are now used when fuzzy matching so that the
    score is correctly computed when using non-ascii characters
  * Proper unicode support in match.c so case insensitive matching works on
    non-ascii characters
  * Added additional information about the semantics of shift vs non-shift
    modifiers
  * Moved the list of modifier names to the top of wofi-keys(7) to make it
    easier to find
  * Added documentation explicitly specifying how to use modifier keys
  * Switched out the string literal "Up" for key_default to match the rest of
    the key definitions
  * Added documentation for how to bind multiple key combinations to a single
    action
  * Fixed incorrect key binding listed in wofi(5) for key_backward
  * Hiding the search bar now disables it so you can't type into it. Fixes #234
  * Added --no-custom-entry
  * Greatly simplified the line size code, it works a lot better than before
  * Added the use_search_box option
  * Fixed hide_search=true for surfaces that don't use percent sizing
  * The hide_search config option now behaves correctly. It does exactly the
    same thing as key_hide_search but on launch. This now also allows you to
    un-hide the search with key_hide_search if wofi is launched with
    hide_search=true
  * Fixed #216 arrow key issue. This was caused by the fix to #184. Both issues
    should now be resolved
  * Fixed segfault when cache is broken #213

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 12 08:58:20 UTC 2024 - Jan Baier <jbaier@suse.com>

- update to 1.4.1:
  * Added wofi_exit(). This allows correct handling of custom exit status codes
    on non-glibc systems. This function should always be used for exiting wofi
    as libc exit() will no longer correctly handle error situations.
  * Changed the function signature of config_get_mnemonic(). This new signature
    uses the correct types so that the default argument promotions caused by
    varargs is in spec.
