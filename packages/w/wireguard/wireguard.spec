%description
WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and uses
state-of-the-art cryptography (the "Noise" protocol). It aims to be
faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding
the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
