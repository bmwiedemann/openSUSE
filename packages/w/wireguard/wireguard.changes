-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 15 20:27:31 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20181115
  == Changes ==
  * Zinc no longer ships generated assembly code. Rather, we now
    bundle in the original perlasm generator for it. The primary purpose
    of this snapshot is to get testing of this.
  * Clarify the peer removal logic and make lifetimes more precise.
  * Use READ_ONCE for is_valid and is_dead.
  * No need to use atomic when the recounter is mutex protected.
  * Fix up macros and annotations in allowedips.
  * Increment drop counter when staged packets are dropped.
  * Use static constants instead of enums for 64-bit values in selftest.
  * Mark large constants as ULL in poly1305-donna64.
  * Fix sparse warnings in allowedips debugging code.
  * Do not use wg_peer_get_maybe_zero in timer callbacks, since we now can
    carefully control the lifetime of these functions and ensure they never
    execute after dropping the last reference.
  * Cleanup hashing in ratelimiter.
  * Do not guard timer removals, since del_timer is always okay.
  * We now check for PM_AUTOSLEEP, which makes the clear*on-suspend decision a
    bit more general.
  * Set csum_level to ~0, since the poly1305 authenticator certainly means
    that no data was modified in transit.
  * Use CHECKSUM_PARTIAL check for skb_checksum_help instead of
    skb_checksum_setup check.
  * wg.8: specify that wg(8) shows runtime info too
  * wg.8: AllowedIPs isn't actually required
  * keygen-html: add missing glue macro
  * wg-quick: android: do not choke on empty allowed-ips

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- fix building multiple kernel flavors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 18 17:26:09 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20181018
== Changes ==

  * compat: don't output for grep errors
  * compat: look in Kbuild and Makefile since they differ based on arch
  * create-patch: blacklist instead of whitelist
  
  This should solve the last of the compat issues introduced with the revamped
  build system and upstream changes.
  
  * qemu: kill after 20 minutes
  
  Our test suite now accounts for hangs.
  
  * global: prefix functions used in callbacks with wg_
  * global: rename struct wireguard_ to struct wg_
  * global: more nits
  * timers: avoid using control statements in macro
  * allowedips: remove control statement from macro by rewriting
  * device: use textual error labels always
  * global: give if statements brackets and other cleanups
  * main: change module description
  * main: get rid of unloaded debug message
  
  Stylistic cleanups from upstream.
  
  * netlink: do not stuff index into nla type
  
  It's not used for anything, and LKML doesn't like the type being used as an
  index value. Technically this changes UAPI, but in practice nobody used this,
  and if they did use it for anything, that thing was probably broken anyway.
  
  * allowedips: swap endianness early on
  
  Otherwise if gcc's optimizer is able to look far in but not overly far
  in, we wind up with "warning: 'key' may be used uninitialized in this
  function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]".
  
  * tools: use libc's endianness macro if no compiler macro
  * tools: compile on gnu99
  
  This lets us be compiled with ancient gcc.
  
  * tools: don't fail if a netlink interface dump is inconsistent
  
  Netlink returns NLM_F_DUMP_INTR if the set of all tunnels changed
  during the dump. That's unfortunate, but is pretty common on busy
  systems that are adding and removing tunnels all the time. Rather
  than retrying, potentially indefinitely, we just work with the
  partial results.
  
  
  * tools: wg-quick: wait for interface to disappear on freebsd
  
  This should improve init scripts that restart tunnels using wg-quick.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  7 15:38:42 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20181007
== Changes ==

  * makefile: do more generic wildcard so as to avoid rename issues
  
  Yesterday's snapshot broke DKMS installation, which is the majority of distros
  using WireGuard, so we're rushing out a fix the day after so that people can
  actually run it.
  
  * compat: account for ancient ARM assembler
  * compat: make asm/simd.h conditional on its existence
  * compat: clang cannot handle __builtin_constant_p
  
  Yesterday's snapshot broke old ARM kernels and Android kernels using Clang.
  
  * crypto: disable broken implementations in selftests
  
  If the selftests determine a particular crypto implementation doesn't work, it
  prints a warning -- since that would be a pretty grave bug -- but it also just
  disables that implementation so that we don't compute anything incorrectly.
  
  * crypto: use BIT(i) & bitmap instead of (bitmap >> i) & 1
  * allowedips: document additional nobs
  * crypto: clean up remaining .h->.c
  * global: style nits
  
  Various cleanups and style nits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  6 10:29:00 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20181006
== Changes ==

  * Account for big-endian 2^26 conversion in Poly1305.
  * Account for big-endian NEON in Curve25519.
  * Fix macros in big-endian AArch64 code so that this will actually run there
    at all.
  * Prefer if (IS_ENABLED(...)) over ifdef mazes when possible.
  * Call simd_relax() within any preempt-disabling glue code every once in a
    while so as not to increase latency if folks pass in super long buffers.
  * Prefer compiler-defined architecture macros in assembly code, which puts us
    in closer alignment with upstream CRYPTOGAMS code, and is cleaner.
  * Non-static symbols are prefixed with wg_ to avoid polluting the global
    namespace.
  * Return a bool from simd_relax() indicating whether or not we were
    rescheduled.
  * Reflect the proper simd conditions on arm.
  * Do not reorder lines in Kbuild files for the simd asm-generic addition,
    since we don't want to cause merge conflicts.
  * WARN() if the selftests fail in Zinc, since if this is an initcall, it won't
    block module loading, so we want to be loud.
  * Document some interdependencies beside include statements.
  * Add missing static statement to fpu init functions.
  * Use union in chacha to access state words as a flat matrix, instead of
    casting a struct to a u8 and hoping all goes well. Then, by passing around
    that array as a struct for as long as possible, we can update counter[0]
    instead of state[12] in the generic blocks, which makes it clearer what's
    happening.
  * Remove __aligned(32) for chacha20_ctx since we no longer use vmovdqa on x86,
    and the other implementations do not require that kind of alignment either.
  * Submit patch to ARM tree for adjusting RiscPC's cflags to be -march=armv3 so
    that we can build code that uses umull.
  * Allow CONFIG_ARM[64] to imply [!]CONFIG_64BIT, and use zinc arch config
    variables consistently throughout.
  * Document rationale for the 2^26->2^64/32 conversion in code comments.
  * Convert all of remaining BUG_ON to WARN_ON.
  * Replace `bxeq lr` with `reteq lr` in ARM assembler to be compatible with old
    ISAs via the macro in <asm/assembler.h>.
  * Do not allow WireGuard to be a built-in if IPv6 is a module.
  * Writeback the base register and reorder multiplications in the NEON x25519
    implementation.
  * Try all combinations of different implementations in selftests, so that
    potential bugs are more immediately unearthed.
  * Self tests and SIMD glue code work with #include, which lets the compiler
    optimize these. Previously these files were .h, because they were included,
    but a simple grep of the kernel tree shows 259 other files that carry out
    this same pattern. Only they prefer to instead name the files with a .c
    instead of a .h, so we now follow the convention.
  * Support many more platforms in QEMU, especially big endian ones.
  * Kernels < 3.17 don't have read_cpuid_part, so fix building there.

- Update to version 0.0.20180925

  * chacha20: add bounds checking to selftests
  * curve25519-hacl64: reduce stack usage under KASAN
  
  Tons of improvements to our cryptography API, including some nice performance
  boosts on ARM Cortex-A7 and MIPS32r2.
  
  * allowedips: change from BUG_ON to WARN_ON
  * allowedips: work around kasan stack frame bug in selftest
  * global: put SPDX identifier on its own line
  * netlink: reverse my christmas trees
  * global: reduce stack frame size
  
  Style and correctness changes. We now use less stack space as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 18 20:44:10 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180918
== Changes ==

  * blake2s-x86_64: fix whitespace errors
  * crypto: do not use compound literals in selftests
  * crypto: make sure UML is properly disabled
  * kconfig: make NEON depend on CPU_V7
  * poly1305: rename finish to final
  * chacha20: add constant for words in block
  * curve25519-x86_64: remove useless define
  * poly1305: precompute 5*r in init instead of blocks

  * poly1305: do not require simd context for arch
  * chacha20-x86_64: cascade down implementations
  * crypto: pass simd by reference
  * chacha20-x86_64: don't activate simd for small blocks
  * poly1305-x86_64: don't activate simd for small blocks

  * curve25519-arm: only compile if symbols will be used
  * chacha20poly1305: add __init to selftest helper functions
  * chacha20: add independent self test
  
  Tons of improvements all around the board to our cryptography library,
  including some performance boosts with how we handle SIMD for small packets.
  
  * send/receive: reduce number of sg entries
  
  This quells a powerpc stack usage warning.
  
  * global: remove non-essential inline annotations
  
  We now allow the compiler to determine whether or not to inline certain
  functions, while still manually choosing so for a few performance-critical
  sections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 11 19:33:39 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180910
== Changes ==

  * curve25519: arm: do not modify sp directly
  * compat: support neon.h on old kernels
  * compat: arch-namespace certain includes
  * compat: move simd.h from crypto to compat since it's going upstream
  
  This fixes a decent amount of compat breakage and thumb2-mode breakage
  introduced by our move to Zinc.
  
  * crypto: use CRYPTOGAMS license
  
  Rather than using code from OpenSSL, use code directly from AndyP.
  
  * poly1305: rewrite self tests from scratch
  * poly1305: switch to donna
  
  This makes our C Poly1305 implementation a bit more intensely tested and also
  faster, especially on 64-bit systems. It also sets the stage for moving to a
  HACL* implementation when that's ready.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  4 18:37:47 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180904
== Changes ==

  * wg-quick: darwin: prefer system paths for tools
  
  The only things wg-quick(8) needs from Homebrew are bash(1) and wg(8).
  Other than that, it's explicitly coded against the native system
  utilities. Since wg-quick(8) and bash(1) are invoked in auto_su by their
  full absolute path (via $SELF and $BASH, respectively), we can simply
  set the $PATH to be prefixed by the default system binary paths. This
  way, if users install tools that conflict with system tools -- such as
  GNU coreutils -- we won't accidently call those.
  
  * wg-quick: check correct variable for route deduplication
  
  This should avoid adding duplicate routes when adding the allowed IPs as
  interface routes automatically.
  
  * Kconfig: use new-style help marker
  * global: run through clang-format
  * uapi: reformat
  * global: satisfy check_patch.pl errors
  * global: prefer sizeof(*pointer) when possible
  * global: always find OOM unlikely
  
  Tons of style cleanups.
  
  * crypto: use unaligned helpers
  
  We now avoid unaligned accesses for generic users of the crypto API.
  
  * crypto: import zinc
  
  More style cleanups and a rearrangement of the crypto routines to fit how this
  is going to work upstream. This required some fairly big changes to our build
  system, so there may be some build errors we'll have to address in subsequent
  snapshots.
  
  * compat: rng_is_initialized made it into 4.19
  
  We therefore don't need it in the compat layer anymore.
  
  * curve25519-hacl64: use formally verified C for comparisons
  
  The previous code had been proved in Z3, but this new code from upstream
  KreMLin is directly generated from the F*, which is preferable. The
  assembly generated is identical.
  
  * curve25519-x86_64: let the compiler decide when/how to load constants
  
  Small performance boost.
  
  * curve25519-arm: reformat
  * curve25519-arm: cleanups from lkml
  * curve25519-arm: add spaces after commas
  * curve25519-arm: use ordinary prolog and epilogue
  * curve25519-arm: do not waste 32 bytes of stack
  * curve25519-arm: prefix immediates with #
  
  This incorporates ASM nits from upstream review.
  
  * netlink: insert peer version placeholder
  * tools: ipc: do not warn on unrecognized netlink attributes

- Update to version 0.0.20180809
== Changes ==

  * send: switch handshake stamp to an atomic
  
  Rather than abusing the handshake lock, we're much better off just using
  a boring atomic64 for this. It's simpler and performs better. Also, while
  we're at it, we set the handshake stamp both before and after the
  calculations, in case the calculations block for a really long time waiting
  for the RNG to initialize. 
  
  * compat: better atomic acquire/release backport
  
  This should fix compilation and correctness on several platforms.
  
  * crypto: move simd context to specific type
  
  This was a suggestion from Andy Lutomirski on LKML.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: selftest: use arrays for test vectors
  
  We no longer have lines so long that they're rejected by SMTP servers.
  
  * qemu: add easy git harness
  
  This makes it a bit easier to use our qemu harness for testing our mainline
  integration tree.
  
  * curve25519-x86_64: avoid use of r12
  
  This causes problems with RAP and KERNEXEC for PaX, as r12 is a
  reserved register.
  
  * chacha20: use memmove in case buffers overlap
  
  A small correctness fix that we never actually hit in WireGuard but is
  important especially for moving this into a general purpose library.
  
  * curve25519-hacl64: simplify u64_eq_mask
  * curve25519-hacl64: correct u64_gte_mask
  
  Two bitmath fixes from Samuel, which come complete with a z3 script proving
  their correctness.
  
  * timers: include header in right file
  
  This fixes compilation in some environments.
  
  * netlink: don't start over iteration on multipart non-first allowedips
  
  Matt Layher found a bug where a netlink dump of peers would never terminate in
  some circumstances, causing wg(8) to keep trying forever. We now have a fix as
  well as a unit test to mitigate this, and we'll be looking to create a fuzzer
  out of Matt's nice library.

  * chacha20poly1305: selftest: split up test vector constants
  
  The test vectors are encoded as long strings -- really long strings -- and
  apparently RFC821 doesn't like lines longer than 998.
  https://cr.yp.to/smtp/message.html
  
  * queueing: keep reference to peer after setting atomic state bit
  
  This fixes a regression introduced when preparing the LKML submission.
  
  * allowedips: prevent double read in kref
  * allowedips: avoid window of disappeared peer
  * hashtables: document immediate zeroing semantics
  * peer: ensure resources are freed when creation fails
  * queueing: document double-adding and reference conditions
  * queueing: ensure strictly ordered loads and stores
  * cookie: returned keypair might disappear if rcu lock not held
  * noise: free peer references on failure
  * peer: ensure destruction doesn't race
  
  Various fixes, as well as lots of code comment documentation, for a
  small variety of the less obvious aspects of object lifecycles,
  focused on correctness.
  
  * allowedips: free root inside of RCU callback
  * allowedips: use different macro names so as to avoid confusion
  
  These incorporate two suggestions from LKML.

Tue Jul 31 18:30:54 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Upate to version 0.0.20180731
== Changes ==

  * receive: check against proper return value type
  
  Ensure error counters are correct in the receive path.
  
  * embeddable-wg-library: do not left shift negative numbers
  
  Avoids implementation-defined C behavior and also improves performance.
  
  * wg-quick: android: allow package to be overridden
  * wg-quick: android: remove compat code
  
  Small android fixes.
  
  * qemu: show log if process crashes
  * qemu: update musl and kernel
  
  The usual QEMU suite bump.
  
  * curve25519-x86_64: tighten the x25519 assembly
  
  Small performance optimization from Samuel.
  The wide multiplication by 38 in mul_a24_eltfp25519_1w is redundant:
  (2^256-1) * 121666 / 2^256 is at most 121665, and therefore a 64-bit
  multiplication can never overflow.
  
  * curve25519-x86_64: tighten reductions modulo 2^256-38
  
  Small performance optimization from Samuel.
  At this stage the value if C[4] is at most ((2^256-1) + 38*(2^256-1)) / 2^256 = 38,
  so there is no need to use a wide multiplication.
  
  * curve25519-x86_64: simplify the final reduction by adding 19 beforehand
  
  Small performance optimization from Samuel.
  At this stage the value if C[4] is at most ((2^256-1) + 38*(2^256-1)) / 2^256 = 38,
  Correctness can be quickly verified with the following z3py script:
  
  >>> from z3 import *
  >>> x = BitVec("x", 256) # any 256-bit value
  >>> ref = URem(x, 2**255 - 19) # correct value
  >>> t = Extract(255, 255, x); x &= 2**255 - 1; # btrq $63, %3
  >>> u = If(t != 0, BitVecVal(38, 256), BitVecVal(19, 256)) # cmovncl %k5, %k4
  >>> x += u # addq %4, %0; adcq $0, %1; adcq $0, %2; adcq $0, %3;
  >>> t = Extract(255, 255, x); x &= 2**255 - 1; # btrq $63, %3
  >>> u = If(t != 0, BitVecVal(0, 256), BitVecVal(19, 256)) # cmovncl %k5, %k4
  >>> x -= u # subq %4, %0; sbbq $0, %1; sbbq $0, %2; sbbq $0, %3;
  >>> prove(x == ref)
  proved
  
  * ratelimiter: prevent init/uninit race
  
  Fixes a classic ABA problem that isn't actually reachable because of
  rtnl_lock, but it's good to be correct anyway.
  
  * peer: simplify rcu reference counts
  
  Use RCU reference counts only when we must, and otherwise use a more
  reasonably named function.
  
  * main: add missing chacha20poly1305 header
  * send: address of variable is never null
  * noise: remove outdated comment
  * main: properly name label
  * noise: use hex constant for tai64n offset
  * device: adjust comment

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 19 07:26:19 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180718
== Changes ==

  * tools: only error on wg show if all interfaces fail

  wg(8) now has a more reasonable error code semantic.

  * receive: account for zero or negative budget

  A correctness fix that no other drivers implement but that we really should
  be doing anyway.

  * recieve: disable NAPI busy polling

  This avoids adding one reference per peer to the napi_hash hashtable, as
  normally done by netif_napi_add(). Since we potentially could have up to
  2^20 peers this would make busy polling very slow globally. This approach is
  preferable to having only a single napi struct because we get one gro_list
  per peer, which means packets can be combined nicely even if we have a large
  number of peers. This is also done by gro_cells_init() in net/core/gro_cells.c.

  * receive: use gro call instead of plain call

  This enables incredible performance improvements in some cases. Benchmark and
  see for yourself. It should affect large TCP flows.

  * wg-quick: allow link local default gateway

  IPv6 endpoints will now work better on BSD and Darwin.

  * device: destroy workqueue before freeing queue

  Another small correctness fix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  8 17:08:45 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180708
== Changes ==

  * device: print daddr not saddr in missing peer error
  * receive: style
  
  Debug messages now make sense again.
  
  * wg-quick: android: support excluding applications
  
  Android now supports excluding certain apps (uids) from the tunnel.
  
  * selftest: ratelimiter: improve chance of success via retry
  * qemu: bump default kernel version
  * qemu: decide debug kernel based on KERNEL_VERSION
  
  Some improvements to our testing infrastructure.
  
  * receive: use NAPI on the receive path
  
  This is a big change that should both improve preemption latency (by not
  disabling it unconditionally) and vastly improve rx performance on most
  systems by using NAPI. The main purpose of this snapshot is to test out this
  technique.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 25 18:01:02 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180625
== Changes ==

  * receive: don't toggle bh
  
  The last snapshot caused a big performance regression, which we partially
  revert here. This general matter, though, will be revisited in the future,
  perhaps by switching to NAPI.
  
  * main: test poly1305 before chacha20poly1305
  * poly1305: give linker the correct constant data section size
  
  While the default bfd linker did the right thing, gold would sometimes merge
  section incorrectly because of an incorrect section length field, resulting in
  wrong calculations.
  
  * simd: add missing header
  
  Fixes a compile error on a few odd kernels.
  
  * global: fix a few typos
  * manpages: eliminate whitespace at the end of the line
  * tools: fix misspelling of strchrnul in comment
  
  Cosmetic fixups.
  
  * global: use ktime boottime instead of jiffies
  * global: use fast boottime instead of normal boottime
  * compat: more robust ktime backport
  
  We now use the equivalent of clock_gettime(CLOCK_BOOTTIME) for doing age
  checks on time-limited objects, such as ephemeral keys, so that on systems
  where we don't clear before sleep (like Android), we make sure to invalidate
  the objects after the proper amount of time, taking into account time spent
  asleep.
  
  * wg-quick: android: prevent outgoing handshake packets from being dropped
  
  Recent android phones block outgoing packets using iptables while the system
  is asleep. This makes sense for most services, but not for a tunnel device
  itself, so we work around this by inserting our own iptables rule.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 20 20:15:01 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180620
== Changes ==

  * chacha20poly1305: use slow crypto on -rt kernels on arm too
  
  Leftover from the last commit of the previous snapshot that we forgot to
  handle.
  
  * tools: getentropy requires macOS 10.12
  
  Small build time fixup for old versions of macOS.
  
  * queueing: remove useless spinlocks on sc
  * queueing: re-enable preemption periodically to lower latency
  * simd: encapsulate fpu amortization into nice functions
  * simd: no need to restore fpu state when no preemption
  
  This will improve general system latency on preempt-enabled systems, like
  desktops.
  
  * dns-hatchet: apply resolv.conf's selinux context to new resolv.conf
  
  Fixes wg-quick's dns hatchet on CentOS.
  
  * qemu: bump default kernel
  
  By bumping to 4.17.2, we actually uncovered a bug in the SLUB allocator, which
  upstream is now fixing: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/18/1407
  
  * noise: take locks for ss precomputation
  * netlink: maintain static_identity lock over entire private key update
  
  Minor locking correctness fixes and optimizations.
  
  * noise: wait for crng before taking locks
  
  We now make sure that an outgoing packet which needs a potentially unseeded
  rng won't block a call to wg(8), which takes similar locks for retrieving
  data.
  
  * receive: drop handshake packets if rng is not initialized
  
  If the rng is unseeded, we drop incoming handshake packets, so that it's not
  possible for an attacker to fill the handshake queue thereby provoking
  cookies.
  
  * ratelimiter: mitigate reference underflow
  * ratelimiter: do not allow concurrent init and uninit
  
  Minor correctness and hardening fixes, which don't fix anything particular in
  WireGuard, but might be useful if our ratelimiter is ever used elsewhere.
  
  * compat: use stabler lkml links
  * poly1305: add missing string.h header
  
  Minor fixups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 13 18:07:07 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180613
== Changes ==

  * wg-quick: android: change name of intent
  * wg-quick: android: delay setting users until end
  
  `ndc users add` eventually invokes SOCK_DESTROY on user sockets, causing
  them to reconnect. By delaying this until after routes are set, we
  ensure that the sockets reconnect using the tunnel, rather than the old
  route. This fixes push notifications on Android.
  
  * chacha20: add missing include to header
  
  Fixes a compile error on some kernels.
  
  * tools: encoding: add missing static array constraints
  
  Makes static analyzers happier.
  
  * tools: support getentropy(3)
  
  This lets us take advantage of both recent glibc calls as well as the long
  standing getentropy functions on the BSDs.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: use slow crypto on -rt kernels
  
  In rt kernels, spinlocks call schedule(), which means preemption can't
  be disabled. The FPU disables preemption. Hence, we can either
  restructure things to move the calls to kernel_fpu_begin/end to be
  really close to the actual crypto routines, or we can do the slower
  lazier solution of just not using the FPU at all on -rt kernels. This
  patch goes with the latter lazy solution. The reason why we don't
  place the calls to kernel_fpu_begin/end close to the crypto routines
  in the first place is that they're very expensive, as it usually
  involves a call to XSAVE. So on sane kernels, we benefit from only
  having to call it once.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  1 16:41:35 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180531
  == Changes ==
  * compat: don't clash with get_random_u32 backports

  This should allow running on recent Qualcomm msm8998 kernels.

  * wg-quick: determine IPs when saving interface
  * wg-quick: darwin: add multiple IP addresses
  * wg-quick: freebsd: configure as p2p link
  * wg-quick: darwin: set DNS servers after delay on route change

  Usual set of wg-quick changes, since the recent cross platform additions.

  * curve25519: x86_64: satisfy sparse
  * curve25519: x86_64: make symbol static
  * crypto: consistent constification

  Small cleanups in the crypto primitives.

  * chacha20poly1305: split up into separate files
  * chacha20poly1305: combine stack variables into union
  * chacha20poly1305: test scattergather functions too
  * chacha20poly1305: test for authtag failure

  We've reorganized our chapoly implementation and added lots of new tests as
  well. The generic C chacha should be slightly faster in the process.

  * poly1305: mips: compute S on fly

  Small speedup on MIPS.

  * device: do not assume dst is always valid

  Fixes a crash when forwarding packets from devices that use flow offloading.

  * tools: constanter time encoding

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  1 16:15:39 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180524
  == Changes ==
  * allowedips: set pointer to null before freeing
  * ncat-client-server: do not always call sudo and use env bash
  * qemu: bump default kernel for gcc 8.1
  * compat: work around qcom 4.9 backports

  The usual fixes.

  * tools: fix OpenBSD build
  * tools: always pass -v as first argument to install

  Portability changes.

  * wg-quick: darwin: rename namefile environment variable
  * wg-quick: darwin: do not remove routes when no real interface
  * wg-quick: freebsd: add new implementation
  * wg-quick: openbsd: add new implementation
  * wg-quick: support FreeBSD/Darwin search path
  * wg-quick: better bash completion for non-renaming OSes
  * wg-quick: allow enumeration of socket files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 19 06:16:21 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180519
  == Changes ==

  * chacha20poly1305: add mips32 implementation
  
  "The OpenWRT Commit" - this significantly speeds up performance on cheap
  plastic MIPS routers, and presumably the remaining MIPS32r2 super computers
  out there.
  
  * timers: reinitialize state on init
  * timers: round up instead of down in slack_time
  * timers: remove slack_time
  * timers: clear send_keepalive timer on sending handshake response
  * timers: no need to clear keepalive in persistent keepalive
  
  Andrew He and I have helped simplify the timers and remove some old warts,
  making the whole system a bit easier to analyze.
  
  * tools: fix errno propagation and messages
  
  Error messages are now more coherent.
  
  * wg-quick: use invoking shell in auto rooting
  
  Rather than letting sudo use bash from PATH, we now have it use whatever bash
  is currently executing the script.
  
  * device: remove allowedips before individual peers
  
  This avoids an O(n^2) traversal in favor of an O(n) one. Before systems with
  many peers would grind when deleting the interface.
  
  * dns-hatchet: update paths
  
  Our reorganizing of the wg-quick bash paths was not sync'd with this patch,
  resulting in some trivial problems for Fedora and OpenSUSE.
  
  * compat: backport for OpenSUSE 15
  
  Usual compat fixes.
  
  * wg-quick: add darwin implementation
  
  We released a Darwin implementation of wg-quick(8), to be used with the new
  wireguard-go snapshot.
  
  * wg-quick: darwin: ensure socket directory exists
  * wg-quick: darwin: remove v6 routes after shutdown
  * wg-quick: darwin: bash correctness
  * wg-quick: darwin: restore DNS on down
  * wg-quick: darwin: use bash from environment and require bash 4+
  * wg-quick: darwin: sometimes there are no network services
  * wg-quick: darwin: avoid routing loop if no default
  * wg-quick: darwin: networksetup does not like missing stdio
  * wg-quick: darwin: reorder functions
  * wg-quick: darwin: simpler inclusion check
  
  After a pretty intense first few days of the new macOS port, we've fixed a few
  bugs and improved functionality of wg-quick(8).
  
  * ncat-client-server: add wg-quick variant
  
  We now have client-quick.sh that does the same as client.sh except it builds a
  file for wg-quick(8), which can then be used in `wg-quick up demo`.

- Add patch:
  * wireguard-fix-dns-hatchet-apply-dot-sh.patch (fixed upstream)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 17:56:34 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180513
  == Changes ==
  * keygen-html: add zip file example
  
  The alpha Android app now supports importing from .zip files, so the example
  contrib code has been updated to show people how to trivially generate .zip
  files from ... javascript. That's right, the WireGuard repo now contains some
  more demo javascript.
  
  * qemu: retry on 404 in wget for kernel.org race
  
  Simple fix for build.wireguard.com's handling of new kernels.
  
  * embeddable-wg-library: zero attribute padding
  
  This imports 37c876b55a2c00424ccda5a300ab5fdec1d88b22 from upstream libmnl.
  
  * allowedips: add selftest for allowedips_walk_by_peer
  * allowedips: use native endian on lookup
  * allowedips: produce better assembly with unsigned arithmetic
  * allowedips: simplify arithmetic
  
  A series of bitmath improvements make allowedips lookups sleeker and faster.
  
  * socket: use skb_put_data
  
  This follows 59ae1d127ac0ae404baf414c434ba2651b793f46 in the kernel.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: make gcc 8.1 happy
  
  GCC 8.1 does not know about the invariant `0 <= ctx->num < POLY1305_BLOCK_SIZE`.
  This results in a warning that `memcpy(ctx->data + num, inp, len);` may
  overflow the `data` field, which is correct for arbitrary values of `num`.
  
  To make the invariant explicit we ensure that `num` is in the required range.
  An alternative would be to change `ctx->num` to a 4-bit bitfield at the point
  of declaration.
  
  This changes the code from `test ebp, ebp; jz end` to `and ebp, 15; jz
  end`, which have identical performance characteristics.
  
  * queueing: preserve pfmemalloc header bit
  
  Precautionary measure. Further work on this function goes on in the netdev
  thread: https://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=152607982125178&w=2
  
  * compat: handle RHEL 7.5's recent backports
  * compat: don't clear header bits on RHEL
  
  WireGuard now supports RHEL's latest kernel, which involved fixing some pretty
  major crashes and clashes with RHEL's backports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 08:30:49 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20180420
  == Changes ==
  * wg-quick: account for specified fwmark in auto routing mode
  
  If we're doing automatic routing with default routes, but the config has
  also specified an explicit fwmark, then use that explicit fwmark, even
  if it's conflicting, since the administrator has explicitly opted into
  using it. Also, when shutting down the interface, we only now remove the
  fancy rules if we're in automatic routing mode with default routes.
  
  * send: account for route-based MTU
  
  It might be that a particular route has a different MTU than the
  interface, via `ip route add ... dev wg0 mtu 1281`, for example. In this
  case, it's important that we don't accidently pad beyond the end of the
  MTU. We accomplish that in this patch by carrying forward the MTU from
  the dst if it exists. We also add a unit test for this issue.
  
  * send: simplify skb_padding with nice macro
  * blake2s: remove unused helper
  * compat: remove unused dev_recursion_level backport
  
  Cleanups.
  
  * poly1305: do not place constants in different sections
  
  We're referencing these constants as one contiguous blob, so if there's
  any merging that goes on with other constants elsewhere (such as the
  kernel's current poly1305 implementation that we hope to replace), then
  these will be reordered and have the wrong values.

  * wg-quick.8: fix typo
  * wg-quick: hide errors on save

  This fixes a small regression in the resolvconf save handling on Debian.

  * compat: stable kernels are now receiving b87b619
  * compat: silence warning on frankenkernels
  * compat: support OpenSUSE 15

  Usual set of fixes for weird kernels.

  * curve25519: use precomp implementation instead of sandy2x
  * curve25519: use cmov instead of xor for cswap
  * curve25519: memzero in batches
  * curve25519: precomp const correctness

  Rather than using sandy2x, which requires use of the vector registers and simd
  instructions (and therefore thermal throttling and register save/restores), we
  instead use BMI2 and ADX instructions to achieve better performance, using:
    - https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/264
    - https://github.com/armfazh/rfc7748_precomputed

  * curve25519: add self tests from wycheproof
  * chacha20poly1305: add self tests from wycheproof

  Wycheproof now provides sneaky test vectors, so we've imported them into our
  self-tests to mitigate regressions. More info can be found at:
    - https://github.com/google/wycheproof

== Changes ==

  * NOTICE: off the grid
  
  Do note that I'll be going off the grid from the end of this coming week until
  April 1. This snapshot is expected to be fairly stable in the interim.
  
  * queueing: skb_reset: mark as xnet
  
  This allows cgroups to classify packets.
  
  * contrib: embedded-wg-library: add ability to add and del interfaces
  * contrib: embedded-wg-library: add key generation functions
  
  The embeddable library gains a few extra tricks, for people implementing
  plugins for various network managers.
  
  * crypto: read only after init
  * allowedips: fix comment style
  * messages: MESSAGE_TOTAL is unused
  * global: in gnu code, use un-underscored asm
  * noise: fix function prototype
  
  Small cleanups.
  
  * compat: workaround netlink refcount bug
  
  An upstream refcounting bug meant that in certain situations it became
  impossible to unload the module. So, we work around it in the compat code. The
  problem has been fixed in 4.16.
  
  * contrib: keygen-html: rewrite in pure javascript
  * Revert "contrib: keygen-html: rewrite in pure javascript"
  
  We nearly moved away from emscripten'ing the fiat32 code, but the resultant
  floating point javascript was just too terrifying.
  
  * Kconfig: require DST_CACHE explicitly
  
  Required for certain frankenkernels.
  
  * compat: use correct -include path
  
  Fixes certain out-of-tree build systems.
  
  * noise: align static_identity keys
  
  Gives us better alignment of private keys.
  
  * wg-quick: if resolvconf/interface-order exists, use it
  * wg-quick: if resolvconf/run/iface exists, use it
  
  Better compatibility with Debian's resolvconf.
  
  * contrib: add extract-handshakes kprobe example

  Copy and paste errors.
  
  * tools: do not collide types with libc clashes
  * tools: FreeBSD doesn't have EAI_NODATA
  * tools: fixup errno handling
  * tools: endian.h is not portable
  
  Fixes compilation and correctness several places.
  
  * tools: allow in-line comments
  
  You can now put a # comment anywhere in a line, in which case, it extends
  until the end of the line.
  
  * wg-quick: match from beginning rather than shift right
  
  This raises the proper error when providing interface names that are too long.
  
  * qemu: add support for powerpc
  
  Now that we have known PPC users, it's probably a good thing to ensure we
  don't introduce bugs, so PPC has been added to our CI on build.wireguard.com.
  
  * poly1305: fix up selftest counter
  
  Make sure we're using the right array length in the debug-mode-only
  self-tests.
  
  * netns: replace n0 ip with ip0, per custom
  
  Fixes up console output consistency.
  
  * qemu: more granular memleak detection
  
  This avoids us getting memory leak errors due to upstream's power management
  drivers leaking, or the like, when we're only interested in WireGuard memory
  leaks.
  
  * socket: free skb if there isn't an endpoint
  
  Fixes a memory leak.
  
  * allowedips: indicate to clang-analyzer that trie is non-null
  
  Hopefully future versions are slightly smarter...
  
  * blake2s: use union instead of casting
  
  Similarly fixes a clang-analyzer issue, as well as ensuring alignment.
  
  * tools: normalize strncpy/snprintf usage
  
  Correctness.

  * curve25519-fiat32: uninline certain functions
  
  This results in much smaller code size and significanat speed gains on smaller
  hardware.
  
  * poly1305: add poly-specific self-tests
  
  Poly is easy to get wrong, so we've added quite a few tests that examine
  certain edge cases and places where other implementations of historically
  failed.
  
  * tools: dedup secret normalization
  * tools: share curve25519 implementations with kernel
  * contrib: keygen-html: share curve25519 implementation with kernel
  
  There is now only one place where we ship 25519 code.
  
  * qemu: disable PIE for compilation
  * qemu: disable AVX-512 in userland
  * qemu: update base versions
  
  Test suite enhancements.
  
  * device: let udev know what kind of device we are
  
  This enables folks to query the device type via udev, which is what systemd's
  networkctl uses.
  
  * tools: fread doesn't change errno
  
  This fixes clearing pre-shared keys on old glibc.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: use existing rol32 function
  * chacha20poly1305: better buffer alignment
  
  Small enhancements.
  
  * curve25519: verify that specialized basepoint implementations are correct
  
  Since some implementations have a specialized function for computing
  basepoints, it's important to do some basic sanity checking with them.
  
  * curve25519: replace hacl64 with fiat64
  
  For about 24 hours, fiat64 was faster.
  
  * curve25519: replace fiat64 with faster hacl64
  
  Then hacl64 caught up, so we moved back to it.
  
  * curve25519: break more things with more test cases
  
  These extra test cases help break the current "rfc7748_precomputed"
  implementation, which we're not using here at the moment, but it is still
  useful to ensure that we don't fall victim to the same bugs.

- Update to version 0.0.20180118
== Changes ==

  * receive: treat packet checking as irrelevant for timers

  Small simplification to the state machine, as discussed with Mathias
  Hall-Andersen.

  * socket: check for null socket before fishing out sport
  * wg-quick: ifnames have max len of 15
  * tools: plug memleak in config error path

  Important bug fixes.

  * external-tests: add python implementation

  Piotr Lizonczyk has contributed a test vector written in Python.

  * poly1305: remove indirect calls

  From Samuel Neves, we now are in a better position to mitigate speculative
  execution attacks.

  * curve25519: modularize implementation
  * curve25519: import 32-bit fiat-crypto implementation
  * curve25519: import 64-bit hacl-star implementation
  * curve25519: resolve symbol clash between fe types
  * curve25519: wire up new impls and remove donna
  * tools: import new curve25519 implementations
  * contrib: keygen-html: update curve25519 implementation

  Two of our Curve25519 implementations now use formally verified C. Read this
  mailing list post for more information:

- Update to version 0.0.20171221
== Changes ==

  * keygen-html: remove prebuilt file

  This follows our mailing list discussion.

  * wg-quick: add the "Table" config option

  In collaboration with Luis Ressel, wg-quick(8) grew an option! We generally
  do not like to add things to wg-quick or allow feature-creep, but this was
  basic enough and mostly involves disabling functionality. Specifically,
  wg-quick now accepts a Table= parameter with these semantics:

    ~ Table=auto (default) selects the current behaviour
    ~ Table=off disables creation of routes from allowed ips altogether
    ~ All other values are passed through to "ip route add"'s table option

  This should enable people to do basic policy routing. It also matches the
  functionality provided by LEDE/OpenWRT's uci config as well as NixOS's
  networking configuration.

  * wg-quick: dumber matching for default routes

  Efficiency.

  * crypto: compile on UML

  UML allows you to compile a Linux Kernel as a standalone ELF binary that runs
  within normal Linux. WireGuard can now be compiled as a normal Linux program,
  runnable on Linux, which is useful for the test suite... and other things.

  * compat: kernels < 3.13 modified genl_ops

  This fixes a rather important bug with 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 kernels, where in
  some cases, gcc failed to de-constify a struct that was marked as const when
  it should not have been on on these older kernels, triggering an oops at
  module insertion time.

- Update to version 0.0.20171211
== Changes ==

  * curve25519: explictly depend on AS_AVX
  * curve25519: modularize dispatch
  
  It's now much cleaner to see which implementation we're calling, and it will
  be simpler to add more implementations in the future.
  
  * compat: support RAP in assembly
  
  This should fix PaX/Grsecurity support.
  
  * device: do not clear keys during sleep on Android
  
  While we want to clear keys when going to sleep on ordinary Linux, this
  doesn't make sense in the Android world, where phones often sleep but are
  woken up every few milliseconds by the radios to process packets.
  
  * compat: fix 3.10 backport
  
  Important compat fixes for non-x86.
  
  * device: clear last handshake timer on ifdown
  
  When bringing up an interface, we don't want the rate limiting to handshakes
  to apply.
  
  * netlink: rename symbol to avoid clashes
  
  Allows coexistance with horrible Android drivers.
  
  * kernel-tree: jury rig is the more common spelling
  * tools: no need to put this on the stack
  * blake2s-x86_64: fix spacing
  
  Small fixes.
  
  * contrib: keygen-html for generating keys in the browser
  
  This was covered here:
  https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2017-December/002127.html
  
  * tools: remove undocumented unused syntax
  
  Not only did nobody know about this or use it, but the implementation actually
  exposed compiler bugs in Qualcomm's "Snapdragon Clang".
  
  * poly1305: update x86-64 kernel to AVX512F only
  
  From Samuel Neves, this pulls in Andy Polyakov's changes to only require F and
  not VL for the Poly implementation.
  
  * chacha20-arm: fix with clang -fno-integrated-as.
  
  This pulls in David Benjamin's clang fix.
  
  * global: add SPDX tags to all files
  
  From Greg KH, we now have SPDX annotations on all files, matching upstream
  kernel's new approach to file licenses.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: cleaner generic code
  
  This entirely removes the last remains of Martin Willi's ChaCha
  implementation, and now the generic C implementation is extremely small and
  clearly written, while delivering a small performance boost too.
  
  * poly1305: fix avx512f alignment bug
  
  Unlucky people may have had their linkers misalign a constant. This fixes that
  potential.
  
  * chacha20: avx512vl implementation
  
  From Samuel Neves, this imports Andy Polyakov's AVX512VL implementation of
  ChaCha which should have a ~50% performance improvement over AVX2, though it
  is still much slower than our AVX512F implementation.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: wire up avx512vl for skylake-x
  
  Some Skylake machines do not have two FMA units (though others do), so we
  prefer the AVX512VL implementation over the should-be-faster AVX512F
  implementation on those machines. What's needed now is to read the PIROM in
  order to determine at runtime whether the particular Skylake-X machine
  actually has the second FMA unit or not, but until that happens, we just fall
  back to the VL implementation for all Skylake-X.

- Update to version 0.0.20171127
== Changes ==

  * compat: support timespec64 on old kernels
  * compat: support AVX512BW+VL by lying
  * compat: fix typo and ranges
  * compat: support 4.15's netlink and barrier changes
  * poly1305-avx512: requires AVX512F+VL+BW
  
  Numerous compat fixes which should keep us supporting 3.10-4.15-rc1.
  
  * blake2s: AVX512F+VL implementation
  * blake2s: tweak avx512 code
  * blake2s: hmac space optimization
  
  Another terrific submission from Samuel Neves: we now have an implementation
  of Blake2s using AVX512, which is extremely fast.
  
  * allowedips: optimize
  * allowedips: simplify
  * chacha20: directly assign constant and initial state
  
  Small performance tweaks.
  
  * tools: fix removing preshared keys
  * qemu: use netfilter.org https site
  * qemu: take shared lock for untarring
  
  Small bug fixes.

- Update to version 0.0.20171122
== Changes ==

  * chacha20poly1305: fast primitives from Andy Polyakov
  
  Samuel Neves and I have spent considerable time and headaches porting,
  reworking, and partially rewriting Andy's optimized implementations of
  ChaCha20 and Poly1305. We now support the following:
  
  On x86_64:
    - Poly1305: integer unit
    - ChaCha20: SSSE3
    - HChaCha20: SSSE3
    - Poly1305: AVX
    - ChaCha20: AVX2
    - Poly1305: AVX2
    - ChaCha20: AVX512
    - Poly1305: AVX512
  
  On ARM:
    - Poly1305: integer unit
    - ChaCha20: NEON
    - Poly1305: NEON
  
  On ARM64:
    - Poly1305: integer unit
    - ChaCha20: NEON
    - Poly1305: NEON
  
  On MIPS64:
    - Poly1305: integer unit
  
  All others:
    - ChaCha20: generic C
    - Poly1305: generic C
  
  This is a pretty substantial amount of new handrolled assembly. It will
  perhaps MURDER KITTENS, so please tread lightly with this snapshot and adjust
  expectations accordingly. I'm looking forward to quickly fixing any issues
  folks find while testing.
  
  Performance-wise, this should see increases all around. The biggest speedups
  will be on ARM and ARM64, but x86_64 and MIPS64 should also see modest speed
  improvements too, especially on Skylake systems supporting AVX512.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: add more test vectors, some of which are weird
  
  Test vectors are pretty important, so we added more to catch odd edge cases
  using the following butcher's code:
  
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import ChaCha20Poly1305
    import os
    
    def encode_blob(blob):
        a = ""
        for i in blob:
            a += "\\x" + hex(i)[2:]
        return a
    
    enc = [ ]
    dec = [ ]
    
    def make_vector(plen, adlen):
        key = os.urandom(32)
        nonce = os.urandom(8)
        p = os.urandom(plen)
        ad = os.urandom(adlen)
        c = ChaCha20Poly1305(key).encrypt(nonce=bytes(4) + nonce, data=p, associated_data=ad)
    
        out = "{\n"
        out += "\t.key\t= \"" + encode_blob(key) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.nonce\t= \"" + encode_blob(nonce) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.assoc\t= \"" + encode_blob(ad) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.alen\t= " + str(len(ad)) + ",\n"
        out += "\t.input\t= \"" + encode_blob(p) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.ilen\t= " + str(len(p)) + ",\n"
        out += "\t.result\t= \"" + encode_blob(c) + "\"\n"
        out += "}"
        enc.append(out)
    
    
        out = "{\n"
        out += "\t.key\t= \"" + encode_blob(key) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.nonce\t= \"" + encode_blob(nonce) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.assoc\t= \"" + encode_blob(ad) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.alen\t= " + str(len(ad)) + ",\n"
        out += "\t.input\t= \"" + encode_blob(c) + "\",\n"
        out += "\t.ilen\t= " + str(len(c)) + ",\n"
        out += "\t.result\t= \"" + encode_blob(p) + "\"\n"
        out += "}"
        dec.append(out)
    
    
    make_vector(0, 0)
    make_vector(0, 8)
    make_vector(1, 8)
    make_vector(1, 0)
    make_vector(129, 7)
    make_vector(256, 0)
    make_vector(512, 0)
    make_vector(513, 9)
    make_vector(1024, 16)
    make_vector(1933, 7)
    make_vector(2011, 63)
    
    print("======== encryption vectors ========")
    print(", ".join(enc))
    
    print("\n\n\n======== decryption vectors ========")
    print(", ".join(dec))
  
  * wg-quick: document localhost exception and v6 rule
  
  Probably a "kill switch" wants this too:
     -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL
  so that basic local services can continue to work.
  
  * selftest: allowedips: randomized test mutex update
  * allowedips: do not write out of bounds
  * device: uninitialize socket first in destruction
  * tools: tighten up strtoul parsing
  
  Small fixups.
  
  * qemu: update kernel
  * qemu: use unprefixed strip when not cross-compiling
  
  Fedora/Redhat doesn't ship with a prefixed strip, and we don't need
  to use it anyway when we're not cross compiling, so don't.
  
  * compat: 3.16.50 got proper rt6_get_cookie
  * compat: stable finally backported fix
  * compat: new kernels have netlink fixes
  * compat: fix compilation with PaX
  
  Usual set of compatibility updates.
  
  * curve25519-neon: compile in thumb mode
  
  In thumb mode, it's not possible to use sp as an operand of and, so
  we have to muck around with r3 as a scratch register.
  
  * socket: only free socket after successful creation of new
  
  When an interface is down, the socket port can change freely. A socket
  will be allocated when the interface comes up, and if a socket can't be
  allocated, the interface doesn't come up.
  
  However, a socket port can change while the interface is up. In this
  case, if a new socket with a new port cannot be allocated, it's
  important to keep the interface in a consistent state. The choices are
  either to bring down the interface or to preserve the old socket. This
  patch implements the latter.
  
  * global: switch from timeval to timespec
  
  This gets us nanoseconds instead of microseconds, which is better, and
  we can do this pretty much without freaking out existing userspace,
  which doesn't actually make use of the nano/microseconds field. The below
  test program shows that this won't break existing sizes:
  
    zx2c4@thinkpad ~ $ cat a.c
    void main()
    {
        puts(sizeof(struct timeval) == sizeof(struct timespec) ?
          "success" : "failure");
    }
    zx2c4@thinkpad ~ $ gcc a.c -m64 && ./a.out
    success
    zx2c4@thinkpad ~ $ gcc a.c -m32 && ./a.out
    success

- Update to version 0.0.20171111
  == Changes ==

  * Kconfig: remove trailing whitespace
  * allowedips: rename from routingtable
  * tools: remove ioctl cruft
  * global: revert checkpatch.pl changes
  
  Cleanliness.
  
  * device: please lockdep
  * device: wait for all peers to be freed before destroying
  
  These make the various checkers happy.
  
  * netlink: plug memory leak
  * qemu: check for memory leaks
  
  There was a small memory leak on the netlink configuration layer that's now
  been fixed.
  
  * receive: hoist fpu outside of receive loop
  
  Should be a small speedup on x86_64.
  
  * qemu: more debugging
  * qemu: bump kernel version
  
  Significantly more debugging checkers have been turned on.
  
  * wg-quick: stat the correct enclosing folder of config file
  * wg-quick: allow for tabs in keys
  
  Minor fixups for wg-quick(8).
  
  * compat: 4.4.0 has strange ECN function
  
  Nobody actually runs base 4.4.0, but this is more correct anyway.
  
  * netlink: make sure we reserve space for NLMSG_DONE
  
  A rather important change - due to an upstream kernel bug, that's existed
  since the advent of netlink itself, sometimes wg(8) failed to receive valid
  data back from kernelspace, resulting in "ENOBUFS" when trying to dump all
  peers. This patch works around it while we wait for upstream to commit the
  fix.
  
  * curve25519: reject deriving from NULL private keys
  * tools: allow for NULL keys everywhere
  
  A null 25519 private point isn't a valid point (prior to normalization), which
  is why we use it as the "unsetting" value. Conversely, however, except for
  psk, we should be using the existence of it in the netlink message being an
  indication of whether or not it's set, for the tools.

  immediately.
  
  * wg-quick: save all hooks on save
  
  Tiny bug fix for 'wg-quick save'.

- Fix wg-quick's DNS= directive with a hatchet
- Update to version 0.0.20171031
== Changes ==

  * netns: use read built-in instead of ncat hack for dmesg
  * netns: use time-based test instead of quantity-based
  * qemu: allow for cross compilation
  * qemu: work around ccache bugs
  * qemu: test using four cores
  * selftest: initialize mutex in routingtable selftest
  
  We now cross compile and run in QEMU for x86_64, i686,
  ARMv7, Aarch64, and MIPS. You can see the current build
  status on: https://www.wireguard.com/build-status/
  
  * stats: more robust accounting
  * compat: fix up stat calculation for udp tunnel
  
  The statistics from `ip link -stats` or from `wg show` are
  now much more accurate.
  
  * global: accept decent check_patch.pl suggestions
  * global: infuriating kernel iterator style
  * global: style nits
  * global: use fewer BUG_ONs
  * global: get rid of useless forward declarations
  * blake2: include headers for macros
  * tools: correct type for CTRL_ATTR_FAMILY_ID
  
  Lots of style cleanups.
  
  * crypto/avx: make sure we can actually use ymm registers
  
  This fixes an issue on some Xen platforms that expose
  conflicting CPU features.
  
  * peer: get rid of peer_for_each magic
  * peer: store total number of peers instead of iterating
  
  A major cleanup of our peer iteration logic, getting rid
  of a big ugly macro and clarifying our locking semantics.
  
  * compat: be sure to include header before testing
  
  * wg-quick: allow specifiying multiple hooks
  
  You can now specify {Post,Pre}{Down,Up} multiple times, and
  the commands will then run in succession.
  
  * wg-quick: remember to rewind DNS settings on failure
  
  Small consistency fix.
  
  * wg-quick: allow for saving existing interface
  
  There is now a 'save' option for saving an existing
  configuration without having to bring down the device.
  
  * wg-quick: fsync the temporary file before renaming
  
  In case the system looses power, you are now left with
  either the old file or the new file but not an empty file.
  
  * wg-quick: allow for the hatchet, but not by default
  
  In order to account for distributions that do not have an
  implementation of resolvconf(8), the contrib directory ships
  with an alternative implementation that may be patched in.
  This was extensively discussed and debated on the mailing
  list.
  
  * device: only take reference if netns is different
  
  Solves an important memory leak when tearing down network
  namespaces that haven't moved the wireguard device.
  
  * device: expand scope of destruct lock
  * timers: guard entire setting in block
  
  Just to be certain.
  
  * curve25519: only enable int128 if compiler support is sound
  
  Allows building for Aarch64 with old gcc (such as that used
  by Android) where we don't want to branch to a __multi3.
  
  * contrib: add reresolve-dns
  
  A small script that's been passed around for a while now for
  reresolving DNS entries from a cronjob.

  * receive: improve control flow
  * socket: eliminate dead code
  * device: our use of queues means this check is worthless
  * device: no need to take lock for integer comparison
  * blake2s: modernize API and have faster _final
  * compat: support READ_ONCE

  Assorted cleanups to the module, including nice things like marking our
  precomputations as const.
  
  * Makefile: even prettier output
  * Makefile: do not clean before cloc
  * selftest: better test index for rate limiter
  * netns: disable accept_dad for all interfaces
  
  Fixes in our testing and build infrastructure. Now works on the 4.14 rc
  series.
  
  * qemu: add build-only target
  * qemu: work on ubuntu toolchain
  * qemu: add more debugging options to main makefile
  * qemu: simplify shutdown
  * qemu: open /dev/console if we're started early
  * qemu: phase out bitbanging
  * qemu: always create directory before untarring
  * qemu: newer packages
  * qemu: put hvc directive into configuration
  
  This is the beginning of working out a cross building test suite, so we do
  several tricks to be less platform independent.
  
  * tools: encoding: be more paranoid
  * tools: retry resolution except when fatal
  * tools: don't insist on having a private key
  * tools: add pass example to wg-quick man page
  * tools: style
  * tools: newline after warning
  * tools: account for padding being in zero attribute
  
  Several important tools fixes, one of which suppresses a needless warning.

- Update to version 0.0.20171011
== Changes ==

  * receive: do not consider 0 jiffies as being set
  
  This should fix some issues on 32-bit platforms with sending cookie reply
  messages when they're not required.
  
  * socket: compare while unlocked first
  * socket: don't bother recomparing afterwards
  * socket: gcc inlining makes this faster
  
  We no longer take a lock when updating the endpoint, which should yield
  some performance benefits.
  
  * tools: try again if dump is interrupted
  
  The tools will now try again to get information about a device if somebody
  tries to modify the device while a dump is occurring.
  
  * Makefile: quiet recursive make
  
  Our makefile produces slightly slicker output now.
  
  * qemu: bump stable kernel
  
  Usual test suite house maintenance.
  
  * crypto/x86_64: satisfy stack validation 2.0
  
  The kernel's new objtool used to warn on some things in our AVX
  implementations, especially code generated from qhasm which uses its own
  stack layout. This commit works around it to squelch warnings.
  
  * routingtable: only use device's mutex, not a special rt one
  * routingtable: iterate progressively
  * tools: store tail pointer to make coalescing peers fast
  
  We replace the Netlink algorithms for grabbing the allowed IPs, so
  that they're now O(n) instead of O(n^2).
  
  * tools: warn once on unrecognized items
  
  This follows this LKML discussion:
  https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg457468.html
  
  * compat: move version logic to compat.h and out of main .c
  * contrib: filter compat lines
  
  Should make it easier to produce a compat-free WireGuard tree.
  
  * send: do not requeue if packet is dead
  * socket: set skb->mark in addition to flowi
  
  Mangle tables now work with wg-quick.
  
  * tools: man: include kill-switch documentation using fwmark
  
  Essentially:
  iptables -I OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -j REJECT
  
  * receive: disable bh before using stats seq lock
  
  This avoids a potential deadlock with interrupts and the stats counters.

Fri Oct  6 20:46:56 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20171005
  == Changes ==

  * tools: simmer down silly compilers
  * tools: compile on non-Linux
  * contrib: remove worthless build artifact
  * kernel-tree: remember UAPI in patch creation
  * curve25519-neon-arm: force ARM encoding, since this is unrepresentable in Thumb
  * compat: support ptr_ring for old kernels
  * compat: conditionally redefine GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM
  * compat: RHEL backported netlink changes
  
  These here are all compatibility-related fixes mostly left over from churn of
  the previous snapshots, where we lost some compatibility with old kernels and
  weird toolchains. The above series of fixes brings us back up to par, and
  should make life slightly easier for a few packagers who had to work-around
  things in the last snapshot.
  
  * compat: macro rewrite netlink instead of cluttering
  * global: satisfy bitshift pedantry
  * global: use _WG prefix for include guards
  * global: add space around variable declarations
  * queueing: cleanup skb_padding
  
  Style, mostly.
  
  * Makefile: add non-verbose mode to tools
  * Makefile: clang now builds the kernel, so use scan-build
  
  One touch static analysis: `make check`.
  
  * receive: simplify message type validation
  * receive: use local keypair, not ctx keypair in error path
  * send: put keypair reference
  * receive: we're not planning on turning that into a while loop now
  * queueing: use ptr_ring instead of linked lists
  * receive: do not store endpoint in ctx
  * queueing: move from ctx to cb
  
  This is another huge change, and the main motivation for releasing this
  snapshot. We move from using a linked list-based queue to a ring buffer-based
  queue, which yields considerable performance increases. It also allows us to
  entirely rid ourselves of a memory cache object, which further increases
  performance and decreases latency. The move to a ring buffer will also make
  writing lock-less algorithms easier, which will eventually increase our
  performance on systems with extremely high core counts.

- Update to version 0.0.20171001
  == Changes ==

  * receive: use netif_receive_skb instead of netif_rx
  
  netif_rx queues things up to a per-cpu backlog, whereas
  netif_receive_skb immediately delivers the packet to the underlying
  network device and mostly never fails. In the event where decrypting
  packets is actually happening faster than the networking subsystem
  receive them -- like with 65k packets with UDPv6 in `make test-qemu`
  -- then this backlog fills up and we wind up dropping some packets.
  This is fine and not all together terrible, but it does raise the
  question of why we bothered spending CPU cycles decrypting those
  packets if they were just going to be dropped anyway. So, moving from
  netif_rx to netif_receive_skb means that whatever time netif_receive_skb
  needs winds up slowing down the dequeuing of decryption packets, which
  in turn means the decryption receive queue fills up sooner, so that we
  drop packets before decryption, rather than after, thus saving precious
  CPU cycles.
  
  * contrib: add sticky sockets example code
  
  A description of how our socket roaming algorithm works by translating it
  into userspace as an example for others.
  
  * queueing: no need to memzero struct
  * send: don't take uninitialized lock
  * device: properly arrange structs
  * peer: rearrange structs
  * queueing: clean up worthless helper
  * queueing: rename cpumask function
  * timers: convert to use netif_running
  * config: do not reset device port
  * tools: use key_is_zero for comparing to zeros
  * queueing: more standard init/uninit names
  * receive: mark function static
  * tools: uapi: only make sure socket file is socket
  * receive: do not consider netfilter drop a real drop
  * peer: ensure that lookup tables are added last
  * timers: ensure safe timer removal
  * peer: remove from RCU lists when the kref is zero
  * noise: use spinlock for rotating keys
  * messages: reduce maximum staged packets per peer
  * ratelimiter: wait for destruction, not for read_unlock
  * tools: do not warn on unrecognized items
  * wg-quick: anchor sysctl regex to start and end
  * wg-quick: verify wireguard interface in more clever way
  * wg-quick: check permissions of parent directory
  
  Tons of bug fixes and cleanups, some of which were quite important. This
  was a very important development life-cycle for shaking out some subtle
  issues.
  
  * netns: disable rp_filter for final test
  * debug: add better insert target
  * qemu: add watchdog for not hanging on oops
  
  Some improvements to our debugging tools, most notably a watchdog timer
  so that build.wireguard.com can properly report OOPSes.
  
  * netlink: switch from ioctl to netlink for configuration
  
  This is fairly huge, and one of the most important things we needed
  to do for reaching mainline inclusion. Rather than ioctl, we now use
  netlink. This was mostly a terrible experience, adding bloat and
  complexity, and making things a lot harder to understand. But upstream
  requires it. I think we did an okay job, and things should go smoothly,
  but all and all I was unimpressed by the clunkiness of the whole
  endeavour. Implementors wishing to integrate WireGuard into their
  network managers can refer to the uapi/wireguard.h documentation header:
  <https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/tree/src/uapi/wireguard.h>.

- Update to version 0.0.20170907
  == Changes ==

  * queue: entirely rework parallel system
  
  This is one of the most significant changes in WireGuard's codebase
  in a long time, so I'd appreciate some thorough testing of this
  snapshot. Work here began as part of Samuel Holland (smaeul)'s project
  for Google Summer of Code, and then I gradually morphed it into its
  present design.
  
  It's a rewrite of the entire multicore processing algorithm of WireGuard.
  No longer are we relying on padata, an inefficient kernel library that
  weighs a whopping 1000 lines of code alone. Instead, we've implemented
  parallel processing using algorithms specifically tailored for WireGuard's
  structures and ordering concerns. In spite of having to provide ourselves
  what this library priorly provided, this snapshot actually weighs in
  _shorter_ than the previous one, which goes to show how cumbersome even
  using padata's APIs were and how much leaner we can make things.
  
  The result is a big improvement in performance on most systems. On my laptop,
  I'm seeing about 1.4x performance as before, which is quite nice. We're
  still working on the best way to scale this to systems with absurd quantities
  of cores, but overall it's working quite well. Future work also involves
  using the DQL and qdisc systems.
  
  In the process, the entire project's code was significantly cleaned up and
  revised.
  
  Samuel was extremely instrumental in kickstarting these efforts, and his
  GSoC was most certainly valuable for getting this project started. He knows
  large parts of the WireGuard codebase well, and I expect for him to be
  a valuable colleague moving forward.
  
  * device: IFF_NO_QUEUE is a private flag, not a public one
  
  This will prevent the weird "20000" flag from showing up in
  ip-link when the device is down.
  
  * socket: satisfy sparse
  * routingtable: satisfy sparse
  * timers: style
  * compat: ensure we can build without compat.h
  * send: no need to check for NULL since ref is valid
  
  Style and correctness fixes.
  
  * qemu: enable debug info for debug qemu
  
  A welcome improvement for all those trying to debug things.
  
  * compat: support RHEL 7.4
  
  This snapshot drops support for RHEL 7.3, moving on instead
  to RHEL 7.4.

- Update to version 0.0.20170810
== Changes ==

  * socket: improve reply-to-src algorithm
  
  This follows an extensive discussion on the mailing list.
  
  We store the destination IP of incoming packets as the source IP of
  outgoing packets. When we send outgoing packets, we then ask the routing
  table for which interface to use and which source address, given our
  inputs of the destination address and a suggested source address. This
  all is good and fine, since it means we'll successfully reply using the
  correct source address, correlating with the destination address for
  incoming packets. However, what happens when default routes change? Or
  when interface IP addresses change?
  
  Prior to this commit, after getting the response from the routing table
  of the source address, destination address, and interface, we would then
  make sure that the source address actually belonged to the outbound
  interface. If it didn't, we'd reset our source address to zero and
  re-ask the routing table, in which case the routing table would then
  give us the default IP address for sending that packet. This worked
  mostly fine for most purposes, but there was a problem: what if
  WireGuard legitimately accepted an inbound packet on a default interface
  using an IP of another interface? In this case, falling back to asking
  for the default source IP was not a good strategy, since it'd nearly
  always mean we'd fail to reply using the right source.
  
  So, this commit changes the algorithm slightly. Rather than falling back
  to using the default IP if the preferred source IP doesn't belong to the
  outbound interface, we have two checks: we make sure that the source IP
  address belongs to _some_ interface on the system, no matter which one
  (so long as it's within the network namespace), and we check whether or
  not the interface of an incoming packet matches the returned interface
  for the outbound traffic. If both these conditions are true, then we
  proceed with using this source IP address. If not, we fall back to the
  default IP address.
  
  * tools: fix removal of psk
  
  Small bug fix for some leftovers of moving from interface-psk to peer-psk way
  back when.
  
  * wg-quick: only bash complete existing interfaces for down
  
  Bash completion is smarter now.
  
  * compat: fix padata to work with 4.13
  
  WireGuard now works with the newly released 4.13 kernel.

- Update to version 0.0.20170706
  == Changes ==

  * global: wireguard.io --> wireguard.com

  We have a new domain name -- WireGuard.com -- moving away from the .io, due to
  security concerns. Along with the new domain, we also have a commonly
  requested page for donations: https://www.wireguard.com/donations/ in addition
  to a Patreon page for those who are into that: https://www.patreon.com/zx2c4 .

  * ratelimiter: consistently use non-bh rcu
  * socket: style
  * wg-quick: usage typos
  * qemu: update default testing kernel
  * qemu: warn on all unseeded random usage when in debug mode
  * compat: work around odd kernels that backport kvfree
  * selftests: ensure that there isnt CPU lag when testing rate limiter

  The usual set of small fixes.

  * send: orphan skbs when buffering longterm

  This works around situations where some apps use the same socket for multiple
  interfaces. It's important in this case that indefinately queued packets don't
  eat away at the socket's send buffer; otherwise sending to other interfaces
  will be blocked.

  * device: support 4.13's extact newlink param

  We continue to support the newest kernels, in this case adjusting to recent
  changes in the upcoming 4.13 release.

  * global: use pointer to net_device

  This follows an upstream recommendation.

  * ratelimiter: use KMEM_CACHE macro
  * data: use KMEM_CACHE macro
  * data: simplify no-keypair failure case
  * send: use skb_queue_empty where appropriate

  Some nice cleanups from Samuel Holland, one of this summer's GSoC students.

  * blake2s: move compression loop to assembly
  * blake2s: fix up alignment issues

  Our BLAKE2s implementation now runs a bit faster, thanks to a commit and some
  additional suggestions from Samuel Neves, one of the BLAKE2 authors.

  * wg-quick: do not set explicit src route for v6 default route

  Clueless network operators were trying to use fec0::/10 as a global address,
  except that range doesn't have the scope. Previously I worked around this by
  adding an explicit `src ...` to the routing table for all v6, but this is
  actually undesirable in some caes, so it's better that network operators give
  out the correct IPs (likely in fc00::/7).

  * wg-quick: do not use grep

  This reduces the set of dependencies for wg-quick.

  * wg-quick: add explicit support for common DNS usage

  wg-quick supports a DNS = field for common usages of DNS. Folks doing
  complicated things or who don't want to use resolvconf can continue to use
  PostUp for this.

  * android: add port of wg-quick

  wg-quick now runs on Android using the ndc command to interact with Android's
  built-in network management daemons.

- Update to version 0.0.20170706
  * ratelimiter: use kvzalloc for hash table allocation
  * ratelimiter: use IPv6 /64 instead of /96
  * ratelimiter: add self-test
  
  These should make the rate-limiting a bit faster. We also switch to using
  a /64 instead of a /96 for IPv6, which seems to be what various RFCs
  recommend for this sort of thing.
  
  * receive: cleanup error handlers
  * gitignore: ignore split DWARF debug info
  * socket: the checkers distinguish between _bh and non _bh
  * counter: use correct unit for indices
  
  Various cleanups.
  
  * compat: support OpenSUSE's backports
  * compat: workaround Ubuntu 16.10 kernel weirdness
  * compat: priv_destructor got backported
  * device: cleanup register_netdev logic
  
  This is the main reason why this snapshot is being released a bit early.
  Kernel 4.11.9 came out, which backported some changes from 4.12, so
  we had to adjust the compat layer. This snapshot should now work with
  this recently released kernel (and all others >= 3.10) too. We also
  add support to a few more odd distro kernels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 30 05:34:20 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 0.0.20170629
  This release fixes a regression reported by Reuben Martin, which we
  then debugged together on his hardware.
  
  Certain length checking conflicted with GRO on particular hardware which only
  pulled the precise UDP header into the skb head fragment. This caused certain
  packets to be rejected unnecessarily.
  
  The regression was introduced during a cleanup of the last snapshot. The
  static analysis suite is being augmented to catch these types of errors in the
  future.

- Update to version 0.0.20170628
  * main: annotate init/exit functions to save memory
  * selftest: remove antique siphash self test
  * haskell: re-add updated haskell example
  * socket: use ip_rt_put instead of dst_release
  * device: avoid double icmp send on routing loop
  * compat: clean up cruft
  * global: cleanup IP header checking
  * compat: do not export symbols unnecessarily
Various cleanups and updates.
  
  * device: netdevice destruction logic change for 4.12
  
  When Linux 4.12 is released next week, we're good to go.
  
  * device: only use one sleep notifier
  
  Rather than have a separate sleep notification for every interface, we now
  have a single notifier for every interface. This improves performance,
  especially when creating many interfaces at once.
  
  * device: remove icmp conntrack hacks
  
  We're moving hacks upstream the proper way, and then backporting them to
  compat.
  
  * receive: extend rate limiting to 1 second after under load detection
  
  After we determine that we're under load, we now wait 1 second before not
  being under load again, a timer which is global across all interfaces on a
  given system.
  
  * curve25519: satisfy sparse and use short types
  * curve25519: keep certain sandy2x functions in C
  
  Certain functions have been made into C, which should improve stack frames and
  reliability.
  
  * ratelimiter: rewrite from scratch
  
  This is a big change. We no longer rely on x_tables or xt_hashlimit, instead
  using a super minimal and sleek token bucket ratelimiter. This works much
  better than the old cruft and should allow us to run more places. It also has
  the benefit of being global, so that it's possible to have thousands of
  interfaces without killing the system with separate GCs and vmallocs, which is
  what happened prior.
  
  * socket: verify saddr belongs to interface
  
  We now more quickly react to changes of the v4 routing table, by ensuring that
  the sticky source address is actually still valid.
  
  * wg-quick: properly match IPv6 endpoint
  
  wg-quick now works better with IPv6.
  
  * wg-quick: use printf -v instead of namerefs for bash 4.2
  
  This adds support for old bash, which means wg-quick should be generically
  "bash 4 and up". I'm not happy about this but EL7 uses old bash, so we're
  stuck with it.
  
  * compat: support EL7.3
  
  Support for RHEL, CentOS, ScientificLinux, and so forth.
  
  * compat: support Ubuntu 14.04
  
  An old crufty Ubuntu is now supported, since it's LTS.

- Update to version 0.0.20170613
  Apologies for such a quick bump after yesterday's. Ivan Kozik noticed
  that on systems with very little entropy in the RNG, systems would hang
  when WireGuard interface configuration was a blocking item in the boot
  sequence.
  
  The previous snapshot added some checks to ensure that ephemeral keys and
  nonces are not generated dangerously before the RNG has enough entropy. It
  did this by simply making interface configuration block the caller until
  it was ready. However, doing this while holding rtnl_lock() meant that it
  would also block the configuration of other interfaces. This in turn meant
  that everything would come to a halt, and enough entropy would only be
  generated after many minutes, which could exceed particular udevd timeouts.
  
  The solution is to move the waiting for entropy to be at exactly the moment
  when entropy is needed: immediately before generating an ephemeral key or a
  nonce. After quite a bit of testing, this works very well. A WireGuard
  interface can be fully configured as early as possible in the boot sequence,
  but it will only ever complete a handshake sometime later, after it has
  gathered enough entropy. Since nothing except handshake processing itself is
  blocked, the rest of the system is freed up to go gather lots of entropy from
  its usual sources.
  
  This is a continuation of the work begun on the upstream Linux kernel,
  described in this LWN article:
      https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/724643/6a0cd411eefcce75/
  
  Because this could be something of a large annoyance, I'm releasing this
  quick patch a day after the previous snapshot.


- Update to version 0.0.20170612
  * timers: queue up killing ephemerals only if not already
  
  We fix up a small detail in the timer logic that changed during the last
  snapshot.
  
  * receive: trim incoming packets to IP header length
  
  Packets are now trimmed to their actual length, not their length+padding,
  before handing to the rest of the network subsystem, so that packets look
  pretty in tcpdump. This doesn't actually affect what userspace sees, since the
  kernel trims it at a later stage, but it does make pcaps a bit nicer to use.
  
  * curve25519: use more standard label convention in asm
  
  This ensures that perf(1) shows the function name instead of the label name.
  
  * compat: remove padata hotplug code
  
  Fixes building on kernels that have HOTPLUG enabled but no PADATA support.
  
  * config: add new line for style
  * device: do-while assignment style
  * peer: explicitly initialize atomic
  
  Style.
  
  * noise: fix race when replacing handshake
  
  Handle a situation in which three peers, all running on the same system, begin
  a handshake with all three of each other, at exactly the same time, on a
  multi-CPU system.
  
  * config: ensure the RNG is initialized before setting
  * compat: use sys_getrandom instead of add_random_ready_callback
  
  We've been working with upstream to add a new API to the kernel for ensuring
  that the RNG actually is seeded. Until they merge it for 4.13, we provide a
  poly-fill to the compat code. This means that WireGuard will block during
  configuration until the RNG has enough entropy, so that it's never in a
  circumstance in which ephemeral keys are generated from bad randomness.
  
  * go test: properly pad message
  * go test: correct tai64n and formatting
  * external-tests: add keepalive packet
  * go test: use x/crypto for blake2s now that we have 128-bit mac
  * external-tests: trim the fat
  
  Improvements for the external tests.
  
  * wg-quick: make sure we have empty table for both v6 and v4
  * wg-quick: match ipv6 default route more broadly
  
  Tiny nits with wg-quick, one of which should now allow multiple v6-only
  wg-quick instances running at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 31 14:51:56 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170517
  This rather large snapshot touches quite a few sensitive areas, so I'm
  releasing it now rather than later to receive feedback on any possible issues.
  It also contains fixes, so everybody should upgrade.

  * man: fix psk mention in wg-quick man page
  * man: update wg-quick(8) to show Debian resolvconf braindamage

  Documentation cleanups.

  * wg-quick: use src routing for default routes in v6

  ip-rule(8) doesn't do the right thing with source addresses, unless we
  explicitly set it inside the route. This fixes wg-quick on IPv6 systems.

  * curve25519: actually, do some things on heap sometimes
  * curve25519: align the basepoint to 32 bytes
  * curve25519: add NEON versions for ARM
  * data: enable BH during parallel crypto on ARM/NEON
  * chacha20poly1305: move constants to rodata
  * chacha20poly1305: add NEON versions for ARM and ARM64

  We now have faster primitives on ARM and ARM64 processors, which should
  improve performance.

  * handshake: process in parallel

    Handshakes are now processed in parallel using all cores, which should improve
  throughput during a storm.

  * noise: no need to store ephemeral public key
  * noise: precompute static-static ECDH operation

  We can precompute the ECDH(s, s) calculation, which improves handshake
  initiation message performance by double.

  * style: spaces after for loops
  * peer: use iterator macro instead of callback

  The most unreadable C ever produced. It might be wise to find a sexier-looking
  alternative at some point.

  * compat: remove warning for < 4.1
  * compat: ship padata if kernel doesn't have it

  The usual array of annoying compat things.

  * rust test: convert screech test to snow
  * rust test: add icmp ping

  We now use Jake's snow library for Noise in the test, which we've expanded to
  complete a ping.

  * config: do not error out when getting if no peers
  * tools: allow creating device with no peers

  Fixing some small things in the tool/config interaction.

  * device: keep going when share_check fails
  * routingtable: remove unnecessary check in node_placement()
  * config: it's faster to memcpy than strncpy
  * timers: fix typo in comment

  Nits.

  * debug: print interface name in dmesg

  For those who compile with `make debug`, you'll be happy to see a bit better
  information in dmesg.

  * timers: rework handshake reply control flow
  * timers: the completion of a handshake also is on key confirmation
  * timers: reset retry-attempt counter when not retrying

  Tightening up our timer implementation, which is quite important.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- update to version 0.0.20170517
  This is a substantial release, containing lots of changes and
  fixes over last four weeks, including a major protocol improvement.
  Since this is a lot of churn, I imagine there will be a considerable
  amount of feedback, resulting in a new snapshot not too long after
  this one.
  
  * compat: use existing iptunnel_xmit function for stats
  * compat: ssse3 support
  * compat: work around ubnt offloading
  * compat: use real crypto_memneq
  * compat: remember to call iptunnel_xmit_stats
  
  We've made quite a few improvements to our compat layer, which
  should add support to more platforms.
  
  * tools: retry name resolution on temporary failure
  
  If you're using wg(8) in an init script, you'll be happy about
  this. If DNS resolution fails, we'll keep trying for a little
  while before eventually giving up. This should allow for a looser
  init service ordering, for those who like to use tunnels with DNS
  endpoints.
  
  * tools: wg-quick: auto MTU discovery
  
  The wg-quick utility now makes a conservative guestiment on the
  correct MTU, if you don't explicitly specify it yourself with the
  new MTU= directive.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: implement vectorized hchacha20
  
  Our implementation of HChaCha20 is now optimized via SSSE3, which should
  improve cookie encryption and decryption speed, which uses XChaCha20.
  
  * qemu: new packages and better debugging
  * qemu: new location for test kernels
  * Kbuild: optimize debug builds too
  
  The usual set of improvements to our testing and debugging facilities.
  
  * jerry-rig: symlinks are better for tree patching
  
  The jerry-rig script now uses symlinks, which should improve its
  compatibility in more odd environments.
  
  * tools: stricter key file reading
  
  The wg(8) utility is now a bit stricter on garbage at the end of
  key files.
  
  * tests: check for stats counter increases
  
  The test suite checks to see whether the interface stats are actually
  being incremented.
  
  * tools: check for proto error on set too
  * tools: opt-in globally to GNU-isms to keep the BSDs happy
  
  General improvements.
  
  * noise: redesign preshared key mode
  
  Preshared keys are now local to each peer rather than to each interface. This
  allows different peers to have different preshared keys, which improves the
  compromise model. This has been joint work with Trevor Perrin's Noise project,
  and today revision 32 [1] has been published, which adds the handshake pattern
  used by WireGuard -- IKpsk2. This is a protocol change -- an accepted
  potentiality of a still experimental project -- and as such all peers will
  need to be updated to this latest snapshot. The wg(8) utility has been
  updated to account for the change of preshared-key being attached to the
  interface to now being attached to each peer. The WireGuard paper [2],
  protocol webpage [3], and Tamarin model all have been updated accordingly.
  
  * tools: support text-based ipc
  
  As discussed on the mailing list, the wg(8) tool now talks to userspace
  WireGuard implementations using a text-based format [4] over a UNIX socket that
  has been designed to be exceedingly easy to parse in all languages. The wg(8)
  tool now runs fine on FreeBSD. [5]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 22 13:20:28 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170421
  * tools: check for malloc failure
  * tools: argc is always 1
  * tools: no hyphen in preshared, to keep uniformity
  * device: use rcu_barrier_bh
  * cookie: move the bangs
  * config: don't allow no-privatekey to mask preshared
  * receive: netif_rx consumes

  General bug fixes.

  * qemu: work on ARM64
  * netns: cleanup and add diagram

  Our QEMU test suite now works on ARM64.

  * tools: side channel resistant base64

  Our implementation of base64 in wg(8) no longer uses the
  system base64 and instead uses a handrolled constant time
  implementation, in order to avoid timing side-channel attacks
  on private key data.

  * compat: work on old 3.10

  Supporting ancient 3.10 allows us to run on the Ubiquiti
  EdgeRouter. There's now a package for this:
  https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/Release-WireGuard-for-EdgeRouter/td-p/1904764

  * routingtable: rewrite core functions

  The routing table has had some core utilities rewritten, bugs
  fixed, and the test suite greatly expanded, complete with a
  randomized comparison against a slow reference implementation
  and a graphviz output option, which produced these amazing PDFs:
  https://data.zx2c4.com/trie_v4.pdf
  https://data.zx2c4.com/trie_v6.pdf

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  9 18:33:54 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170409
  * compat: allow create-patch to work on debian-based builds
  * main: add /sys/module/wireguard/version
  * tools: do not use addrconfig with port in gai
  
  * config: do not allow peers with public keys the same as the interface
  * curve25519: protect against potential invalid point attacks
  * chacha20poly1305: enforce authtag checking with compiler
  
  While Noise is resilliant to invalid point attacks, it's still better to check
  explicitly for NULLs from 25519. While we're at it, we make the compile warn
  if we don't check the return value of sensitive crypto functions.
  
  * locking: always use _bh
  * chacha20poly1305: check return values of sgops
  * data: simplify flow
  * data: cleanup parallel workqueue and use two max_active
  * data: alloca is actually as dangerous as they say
  
  These should improve stability in certain cases, though this involved
  some potentially big rewrites, so I'll keep an eye on incoming bug
  reports.
  
  * compat: support 3.16
  * compat: support 3.14
  * compat: support 3.12
  * compat: support 3.10
  * compat: careful with destructors
  * compat: warn on < 4.1
  
  We now experimentally support kernels going back to 3.10. This means
  that WireGuard should run on nearly all Android devices, the Ubiquiti
  EdgeRouter, and probably most other random Linux devices that you can
  find. I'm looking forward to seeing the community pick up the work
  producing pre-compiled modules for various things.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 24 06:57:42 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170324
  * curve25519: 128-bit integer != x86_64
  
  This will fix build problems on AArch64.
  
  * tools: document # comments in wg(8) man page
  
  * socket: avoid deadlock on port retry
  
  Fixes systems under port exhaustion.
  
  * wg-quick: various cleanups
  
  * uapi: add version magic
  
  While the problem will go away entirely when we switch (back) to
  Netlink, for now it's nice to warn users when wg(8) is out of sync
  with the module, so we do this by adding a version field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 20 18:27:14 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to 0.0.20170320.1
  This is a critical same-day re-release for a bug affecting Sandy
  Bridge systems. All packagers who updated to 20170320 should update
  to this snapshot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 20 06:56:59 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170320
  * device: 4.11 uses cnf for addr_gen_mode
  * receive: last_rx use is discouraged and removed in recent kernels
  * data: transition to skb_reset_tc for 4.11
  
  This snapshot now should work with 4.11.
  
  * create-patch: add context below to work with busybox patch
  
  It turns out that busybox has a patch that doesn't do fuzzy matching.
  
  * device: move sysctl toggling to open time
  * compat: use maybe_unused macro over gcc-specific
  * timers: elide enable check
  * config: satisfy sparse
  
  Cleanups.
  
  * hashtables: get_random_int is now more secure, so expose directly
  * cookie: no need to hash rng
  
  We're trusting the Linux RNG to not be backdoored!
  
  * tools: wg-quick: support old ip(8)
  
  This should allow wg-quick usage with Ubuntu 16.04.
  
  * data: big refactoring
  
  A rather invasive refactoring that may bring bugs with it. Please report
  strange behavior from this release, if any.
  
  * blake2s: add AVX implementation
  * curve25519: add AVX implementation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 27 08:04:18 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170223
 * device: disable ICMP redirects
  
  We now no longer send ICMP redirect messages when forwarding packets between
  two WireGuard peers on the same interface.
  
  * socket: do not try to create v6 socket when disabled
  
  This allows WireGuard to work on systems booted with ipv6.disable=1.
  
  * wg-quick: allow config files without trailing newline
  * tools: give "off" value for fwmark
  * tools: fix bash completion spaces
  
  * tools: add wg show [interface] dump
  
  The wg(8) command learns a new way of dumping information, which should be a
  boost for script writers.
  
  * contrib: add wg-json utility
  
  Using the aforementioned new dump command, it's trivial to transform into JSON
  using a bash script, so this is provided as an example.
  
  * extract-keys: respect compat directives
  
  The extract-keys helper now builds with the new compat system, which should
  enable wireshark dissectors and such to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 16:25:46 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170214
 * wg-quick: unquote fwmark for bash 4.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 14 07:05:02 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170213
 * curve25519: do everything on the stack
  
  Now that OpenWRT ships the MIPS SoftIRQ stack patch, and it's also made it
  upstream, we no longer need to do the mallocing, which should improve
  performance.
  
  * tools: man: recommend correct port
  
  Before we used 41414 in the documentation, which we should be suggesting the
  use of 51820.
  
  * tools: wg-quick: recommend using resolvconf in exclusive mode
  
  -x prevents DNS leakage.
  
  * timers: use setup_timer macro helper
  * timers: use simpler uninit sync technique
  
  Simplifies code a bit.
  
  * socket: synchronize net on socket tear down
  * device: shorter workqueue names to fit in ps
  * main: add `wg` type alias
  
  * socket: general ephemeral ports instead of name-based ports
  
  If no port is specified, a port is selected ephemerally, instead of trying to
  be overly clever with the interface name.
  
  * socket: enable setting of fwmark
  
  This is a nice new feature which enables policy-based routing on fwmarks, used
  by Android and wg-quick.
  
  * tools: setconf should remove existing psk
  * tools: remove key for any empty file
  * tools: wg-quick: support v6 dual stack
  * tools: wg-quick: set LC_ALL for consistent regex
  
  * Kconfig: can be a module
  * create-patch: be sure it's actually after NETFILTER
  
  * compat: backport siphash & dst_cache from mainline
  
  Since siphash is upstream now, we use the mainline implementation. While we're
  at it with reorganizing compat, we also backport dst_cache, so older kernels
  can benefit from it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 15 13:02:19 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170115
  * tools: wg-quick: enforce good permissions
  * tools: wg-quick: parse IPv6 endpoints correctly
  * tools: wg-quick: better removal of suppress_prefix rule
  
  The former is good practice, in the likes of SSH's warnings. The
  latter two are bug fixes.
  
  * tools: error on short ret reads
  * tools: ipc: read from socket incrementally
  * uapi: add missing userspace headers
  * uapi: use flag instead of C bitfield for portability
  * uapi: use sockaddr union instead of sockaddr_storage
  
  This makes the UAPI a bit more portable across languages, which assists
  with the Go implementation efforts.
  
  * config: useless newline
  * Use __read_mostly attribute when possible
  
  General code quality improvements.
  
  * ratelimiter: 800ms too fast, decrease to 2s sustained rate
  
  There's no need to allow 800ms handshakes, when there's already bursting
  and when more than 1 every 5 seconds is already too much, when under DoS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  5 20:27:58 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- install wg-quick

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  5 09:45:06 UTC 2017 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20170105
  * tools: add bash completion for wg(8)
  * tools: add wg-quick
  * tools: add makefile instructions
  * tools: add systemd unit and auto-detection

  This is an all-tools release. The new wg-quick tool
  could use some testing and exposure, so we're posting
  this snapshot a bit early to solicit feedback.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 30 17:14:58 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20161230
  This is a fairly small release, and if you're a lazy package maintainer, you
  can skip it if you don't have the time. The primary improvement and motivation
  for making this snapshot is Android support.
  
  * tools: rename 'bandwidth' to 'transfer' in output
  
  Nice catch from Tomasz Torcz.
  
  * external-tests: update to latest
  
  The Go/Rust/Haskell examples have been updated.
  
  * cookie: optimize
  * blake2s: cleanup
  
  Some nice optimizations and cleanups to increase code quality.
  
  * wg-config: use ip rules instead of tungate
  
  Rather than launching a routing daemon, we just use ip-rule(8). This should be
  more straight-forward, and work on more systems, such as Android.
  
  * tools: syscall.h should actually be sys/syscall.h
  * compat: support 3.18, 3.19, 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 23 21:40:35 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20161223
  * config: allow removing multiple peers at once
  
  Before, specifying several peers to remove on the command line at the same
  time would not work. This is now fixed.
  
  * routing-table: simplify and mask reparented root
  
  Now reparented entries in the routing table are properly masked, so that you
  don't wind up with strange entries like "192.0.0.0/0".
  
  * tools: allowed-ips is easier to parse with spaces instead of ", "
  
  This is a slight change in the tools CLI that should make it easier to parse
  with scripts.
  
  * tools: do not use AI_ADDRCONFIG
  
  It is now possible to configure IPv6 endpoints before IPv6 interfaces have
  successfully gotten their IPs.
  
  * wg-config: cleanup ip parsing
  * wg-config: cleanups
  
  General cleanups.
  
  * cookies: use xchacha20poly1305 instead of chacha20poly1305
  
  This is a big change. To simplify the security analysis, improve speed, and
  simplify the code, we now use XChaChaPoly1305 with a random 24-byte nonce,
  instead of using a random 32-byte salt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 18 18:26:08 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20161218
  * This is a quick snapshot to fix an error with the last one on big endian
    systems. Probably only OpenWRT cares about this, and everybody else can
    happily wait for the next more substantial snapshot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 18:42:07 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version 0.0.20161216
  * messages: increase header by 3 bytes for alignment
  
  PACKAGERS PLEASE UPDATE, as this is a protocol-breaking change.
  
  * device: disable ipv6 auto address generation
  
  Now finally we have working tcpdump and no useless automatic IPv6 addresses.
  
  * device: rc -> ret
  * device: dellink is already implictly unregister_netdevice_queue
  * device: simplify device_init, since it only returns -EEXIST
  * main: consistent lines
  * device: clean up xmit error path
  * device: allocate tstats in newlink
  * global: move to consistent use of uN instead of uintN_t for kernel code
  * crypto: use kernel's bitops functions
  * messages: remove unused constants
  * blake2s: move self tests to correct directory
  * tools: fix latest-handshake typo in documentation
  * noise: update comments
  * config: cleanups
  * types: enforce consistency
  
  Numerous code quality cleanups.
  
  * device: ensure icmp skb length check is done for v6
  * receive: simplify ip header checking logic
  
  This adds a missing length check and generally simplifies length checks
  throughout.
  
  * peer: don't use sockaddr_storage to reduce memory usage
  
  Now that we have struct endpoint, ditching sockaddr_storage is a no-brainer.
  It has the affect of making parallel decryption faster because it requires
  less of an allocation for the ctx, and thus our kmemcache can be merged.
  
  * tests: avoid non-strict writes via printf
  
  Finally fixing this silly old bug.
  
  * ratelimiter: drop family from action for 4.10
  
  We're getting ready for the first rc of Linux 4.10.
  
  * siphash: update against upstream submission
  
  I've been preparing a big patch for upstream Linux to include SipHash, and in
  the process I improved the implementation considerably.
  
  * hashtables: use counter and int to ensure forward progress
  
  This gives the best of both worlds between the two hashtable rng designs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 10 09:35:04 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- rebased patch: wireguard-remove-depmod.diff
- fix URL
- update to version 0.0.20161209
  * hashtable: use random number each time
  
  This reverts some hashtable changes from a while back.
  
  * tests: make sure ncat gets killed
  * tests: directly kill nmap
  * qemu: bump kernel version
  
  Now running `make test` cleans up some zombie ncat processes.
  
  * build system: add dkms installation
  
  This is a biggie for packagers. You can now run `make dkms-install` to install
  the source and dkms.conf file to an environment-variable specified location.
  Since the majority of downstreams are using dkms, providing it upstream makes
  sense.
  
  * data: reset tc when resetting skb
  
  Correctness fix.
  
  * device: clear all peer ephemeral keys on sleep
  * device: make suspend code conditional on CONFIG_PM_SLEEP
  
  WireGuard is now the only VPN software that will clear your ephemeral keys
  before the computer goes into sleep. This is a nice security feature for
  extreme cases.
  
  * timers: add random jitter to handshake retry
  * socket: clear src address when retrying handshake
  
  This increases the reliability of reconnections succeeding in the case of
  connection trouble.
  
  * device: cleaner error teardown
  * main: cleaner error teardown
  * device: traditional if is cleaner than switch for this small
  * compat: build dep errors belong here, since it's out of tree specific
  * cookie: kill redundant forward declaration
  
  Just code cleanups.
  
  * contrib: add wg-config
  
  This is a nice new example utility for adding a wireguard device and
  configuring its IPs and routes all in one go. It's extensively documented in
  its contrib directory and comes with a Makefile installer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 20:09:55 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161129
  * send: send packet initiation only after requeuing to prevent race
  * tests: be sure we get all messages
  * tests: veth does not come up immediately
  
  We've made the internal testing suite a bit more reliable.
  
  * main: add version to dmesg
  
  The module insertion message now shows the snapshot build date or the git
  revision, depending, which will help with more easily determining what's
  happening from people's logs. Too many incompetent bug reporters have
  inexplicably neglected to mention the version or commit being used when
  reporting a bug. This commit works around this human error, requested by
  Kalin Kozhuharov and others.
  
  * device: conntrack is optional
  
  WireGuard can now run on machines that do not have connection tracking,
  requested by Willy Tarreau and Baptiste Jonglez.
  
  * ratelimiter: load hashlimit at modinsert time
  
  Alex Xu pointed out an interesting deadlock, and we were able to trace it to
  internal kernel infrastructure locking things in opposing orders. To work
  around these bugs, WireGuard now loads the hashlimit module at insertion time
  rather than at interface creation time.
  
  * tools: warn about clock going backward
  
  In the event that some script on your system is making the clock go wild
  backward, the tools should probably indicate that the "last handshake
  completed" date can't be correct, and that subsequent connections might fail.
  This was reported by W. Kennington.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 16 20:49:41 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161116.1
  * The earlier snapshot today broke some builds on kernels <= 4.3.
    Packagers only need to bump versions for this single commit if
    distribution kernels use <= 4.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 16 19:53:49 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161116
  * socket: keep track of src address in sending packets
  * socket: ensure that saddr routing can deal with interface removal
  
  This is a rather important change. WireGuard will now reply using the same
  source address on which it received a packet. This improves compatibility with
  multi-homed hosts.
  
  * debug: cleanup skb printing
  * compat: rearrange
  * tests: use private ipv6 addresses
  * tests: trim output
  * various: nits from willy
  * packets: consolidate constants
  * device: better debug message
  
  A whole series of cleanups.
  
  * device: we need NONE for libpcap
  
  In the previous snapshot, we switched to using a VOID device type, so that
  IPv6 autoconfiguration wouldn't assign a useless IP. But this broke libpcap
  and tcpdump. So, we're back to using the NONE type, and getting a useless v6
  address. This requires upstream Linux fixes to solve.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: rely on avx and avx2
  
  This works around braindead VPS providers who disable random opcodes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 10 18:50:07 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161110
  * data: we care about per-peer, not per-device, inflight encryptions
  * data: squelch compiler warning on PARALLEL=n
  * socket: release dst on routing loop
  
  These are cleanups of the previous refactoring.
  
  * qemu: use sparsemem always, for kasan
  * qemu: kasan needs more memory
  
  Automatically detecting memory corruption bugs should not be much easier.
  
  * send: remove redundant time stamp
  * cookie: avoid void pointer arithmatic
  * debug: support dynamic debug on skb addr
  * data: only uses kmem_cache for parallism
  * chacha20poly1305: don't forget version header
  
  General bug fixes.
  
  * socket: use more reasonable skb padding
  
  Rather than the somewhat arbitrary ETH_HLEN + VLAN_HLEN + 16, we now use
  NET_SKB_PAD.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: it's just as fast to use these more simple unaligned access helpers
  
  This completes our fixup of chacha20poly1305 for platforms with slow unaligned
  access, such as MIPS.
  
  * send: simplify handshake initiation queueing and introduce lock
  
  Rate limiting is now applied globally, and while locked, which should make it
  impossible for two threads to simultaneously cause a new handshake.
  
  * selftest: add routing table tests for small subnets
  * routing-table: mask self for better IP display
  
  Giving allowed IPs an address like 192.168.121.128/16 will now be normalized
  to 192.168.0.0/16 automatically.
  
  * curve25519: use kmalloc in order to not overflow stack
  
  This is HUGE. And OPENWRT PEOPLE SHOULD UPDATE IMMEDIATELY. This is a major
  fix for platforms that do not use a separate IRQ stack, such as MIPS. All MIPS
  users should update immediately for improved stability. An interesting mailing
  list thread crossposted to LKML is on this list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  6 11:19:51 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161105
  * socket: use dst_cache instead of handrolled cache
  * compat: stub out dst_cache for old kernels
  * socket: route() returns an error pointer, not NULL on failure
  * socket: big refactoring
  
  Rather than our hand rolled routing cache, we now use the kernel's own
  dst_cache, which was added to the kernel after 4.5 and wasn't available when
  wireguard was first developed. The performance is on par with ours, but this
  way we reduce complexity.
  
  * data: take reference to peer
  * data: use smaller types
  * send: queue bundles on same CPU
  * data: keep FPU on when possible
  * data: use a memory cache for parallel ctx
  * compat: fix variable assumptions
  
  This series of optimizations is huge, resulting in *doubled throughput* on my
  development laptop. This is a major performance win, achieved by batching up
  sequential packets on the same processor core, with the observation that
  waiting for cores to synchronize takes time and defeats multi-core
  improvements. Wireguard should now scale better to systems with tons of cores. 
  
  * compat: some grsec have get_random_long; others do not
  
  Wireguard now builds with the stable release of grsec that used to be testing.
  In otherwords, distro stable grsec packages that are out of date and
  unmaintained can now use wireguard without modification.
  
  * qemu: move build outside of kernel dir to avoid kernel's make clean
  * qemu: work around termio race condition
  * qemu: move marker to top and flush
  * qemu: fail if module selftests fail
  
  The qemu test suite received more stability improvements and a workaround for
  a virtio bug.
  
  * tools: chill modern gcc out
  * c89: the static keyword is okay in c99, but not in c89
  * chacha20poly1305: cleanup magic constants
  
  General code and compiler fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 21:43:28 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161102

  * timers: take reference like a lookup table
  * qemu: newer default kernel
  
  Small improvements as usual.
  
  * device: use ARPHDR_VOID instead of ARPHDR_NONE
  
  We now avoid auto-assigning randomly generated IPv6 addresses to interfaces,
  since this doesn't make sense in the context of cryptokey routing. This should
  prevent those pesky log messages about trying to send to unrouted RA IPs.
  
  * chacha20poly1305: src is different from dst on last piece
  
  This is a critical patch and the reason why this snapshot is being cut so soon
  after the previous. PACKAGERS: bump your packages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 20:12:55 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161102

  * peer: kref is most likely to succeed
  * data: do not allow usage of keypair just before hash removal
  * kref: elide checks
  
  These fix a potential race condition that could trigger kernel warning
  messages.
  
  * tools: everybody hates automatic stripping
  * tools: abstract pkg-config to PKG_CONFIG

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct 30 08:48:27 UTC 2016 - mardnh@gmx.de

- update to version experimental-0.0.20161025
  * noise: comment/document the key swapping
  
  It turns out this is a bit interesting, and there's an interesting TODO item
  in there now regarding a KPI choice that may or may not be an issue.
  
  * debug: keep alive -> keepalive
  * device: better debug message for unroutable packets
  
  The latter should make it more clear why certain packets aren't being sent. In
  most cases for properly configured interfaces, this will just show v6 RA
  addresses.
  
  * timers: avoid thundering herd for simultaneous initiation
  
  By applying slack time to the initiation schedule, we can take advantage of
  the fact that jiffies does not have the same exact start quantum on all
  computers, giving us the natural jitter we need.
  
  * timers: kill half-open handshakes after a while
  
  This ensures partial ephemeral sessions are cleared, even if they're never
  used.
  
  * timers: always delay handshakes for responder
  * timers: only have initiator rekey
  
  These are two different solutions to the same problem. Namely, we don't want
  the responder to reinitiate a handshake at the same time as the initiator, in
  the case that a TCP SYN is sent after 120 seconds of the session. See the
  individual commit messages for an in depth explanation of the two different
  approaches and the one I ultimately chose.
  
  * receive: always send confirmation, even if queue is empty
  
  It's essential that the initiator always sends confirmation to the responder,
  so that the responder can send packets using the new key ASAP. This is
  required when handshakes roll-over during sparsely utilized links.
  
  
  * compat: support PaX constify plugin
  * data: reset all packet fields like tun.c
  * compat: grsecurity backports get_random_long
  
  WireGuard now compiles and runs fine on both grsecurity/PaX stable and testing.

  * poly1305: optimize unaligned access
  This is a very appreciated fix from René van Dorst, adjusting the arithmetic
  in Poly1305 to work fast on platforms with slow unaligned access, such as
  MIPS. According to his calculation, this gives a 50% improvement on small MIPS
  boxes.
  
  * hashtables: use rdrand() instead of counter
  
  Rather than incrementing a counter, we instead use rdrand, which gives us an
  extremely fast source of random numbers. We're still running this through
  siphash with a secret, so a backdoored rdrand implementation won't be a
  problem.
  
  * examples: add nat-hole-punching

  * tools: allow multiple AllowedIPs invocations
  
  Multiple AllowedIPs= lines can now be specified, which could improve
  readability of the config files.
  
  * send: properly encapsulate ECN
  
  Thanks to the guidance of Dave Taht, we now support ECN.
  
  * Rework headers and includes
  * compat: Isolate more functions
  
  In anticipation of upstreaming WireGuard, we've now moved most of our
  version-specific #ifdefs to compat.h, where we use horrible macro tricks to
  redefine functions for old versions. This allows us to keep the actual code as
  clean as possible. When we merge to mainline, compat.h will be deleted
  wholesale.
  
  * tests: test jumbo frames with more transfer
  * tests: add crypto-RP filter test
  * qemu: enhancements
  
  With this an numerous other commits, we've further expanded the test suite.

  * timers: upstream removed the slack concept
  We now group timers ourselves, this time with the ability to round down. This
  ensures that we don't wind up rescheduling timers for every packet, but
  instead keeping things within a quarter second window.
  
  * c: specify static array size in function params
  See https://hamberg.no/erlend/posts/2013-02-18-static-array-indices.html
  
  * contrib: move patchers to contrib/kernel-tree
  There are now two patchers:
    - contrib/kernel-tree/create-patch.sh This patcher simply spits out a patch
      for use with `patch(1)` to stdout.
    - contrib/kernel-tree/jerry-rig.sh This is the old hack that patches into
      the kernel tree a reference to the WireGuard tree.
  
  * tools: do not show private keys in pretty output
  The `WG_HIDE_KEYS` environment variable now determines whether or not keys are
  shown in the pretty `wg show` output.
  
  * persistent-keepalive: change range to [1,65535]
  Linux connection tracking is granular to 1 second, so it's important that we
  do the same.
  
  * selftest: move to subfolder
  * Kbuild: move module deps out of tests/
  * tests: use makefile and expand greatly
  This is a big one. The entire testing subsystem has been entirely expanded.
  With the help of Alex Xu and Naveen Nathan, the test suite is now hugely
  expanded, and even does NAT testing with the persistent-keepalive feature. Not
  only that, but the QEMU runner now builds from a Makefile and is much more
  robust. We now build and run 7 kernels for every single commit, with the test
  results published on https://www.wireguard.io/build-status/
  
  * ratelimiter: do not require IPv6
  CONFIG_IPV6 is no longer required at all for WireGuard.

  * tests: improve test suite and add qemu tester
    You can now run `make test` to do some nice functional testing of the
    module. As well, there's now src/tests/qemu.sh which builds and installs a
    mini userspace and kernel, boots it up in qemu, and runs the tests. This
    does not require root access, and provides a good way of testing for
    packagers. Note that I very much would like to see some patches cleaning up
    qemu.sh if anybody is interested.
  
  * Kconfig: select IP6_NF_IPTABLES if using IPV6
  * build system: revamp building and configuration
    This build system is much more robust, and we've gotten all the dependencies
    worked out. Check out wireguard.io/install/ and scroll to the bottom to see
    all the information about kernel dependencies.
  
  * tools: fix numbering in man page
  * tools: first additions of userspace integration
  * tools: support horrible freebsd/osx/unix semantics
  * tools: rename kernel to ipc
    The wg(8) tool now implements the neccessary protocol to work with new
    WireGuard userspace implementations! The extremely simple IPC protocol is
    documented here -- wireguard.io/xplatform/ -- and is essentially the same
    way in which wg(8) communicates with the kernel. This should be exceedingly
    simple to implement, and we fully expect for all userspace implementation
    efforts currently occurring to use this, so that wg(8) can administer any
    kind of implementation with the same interface. It also compiles on OS X now
    and there's a pull request for including this in Homebrew:
    https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/3183

  * persistent keepalive: use authenticated keepalives
    This is by far the biggest and most important change of this snapshot, and
    indeed is the entire reason why we're releasing another one for folks to
    test out. It was pointed out on the mailing list that if keepalives aren't
    authenticated, it's impossible for the receiver to update the source IP/port
    of the sender. So, we make them authenticated, which means turning on the
    "persistent-keepalive" feature is basically saying "always hold an active
    session open". WireGuard is by default non-chatty -- there won't be an active
    session if you're not sending anything. So, if this is a problem with
    wanting to receive connections while idle and behind NAT, then you can use
    this feature for always maintaining an active session.
  * timers: rename *authorized* functions to *authenticated*
  * timers: do not consider keepalives to be data sent
  * examples: update ncat-client-server readme
  * keepalives: only queue keepalive when queue is empty
  * persistent keepalive: use unsigned long to avoid multiplication in hotpath
  * timers: document conditions for calling
  * timers: move timer calls out of hot loop
  * timers: apply slack to hotpath timers
  * receive: no need to test for !len
  * receive: assume we usually succeed with userspace

  * persistent keepalive: start sending immediately -- the previously released
    feature was not useful without this extra commit. So, getting this in here
    now so that people can actually test this out. Sorry for the churn. Don't
    bother packaging the previous snapshot.

  * Remove old development scripts and cruft from contrib/.
  * Reorganize contrib/examples. Distribution packagers are now encouraged to
    install contrib/examples to /usr/share/${pkg}/examples.
  * Make sure we add 4611686018427387914 to TAI64N second stamps, to be in spec.
  * Improve error reporting and detection in wg(8), ignoring extra input and
    generally being more helpful.
  * Enable always falling back to /dev/urandom when getrandom(2) fails.
  * Add synergy example script.
  * Use `pkg-config` for libmnl in tools Makefile if it exists. Otherwise we
    fallback to just specifying -lmnl statically.
  * Improve go test to send and receive ICMP ping packet through tunnel.
  * Add the new persistent keepalive mechanism, as discussed on the mailing
    list. This is available via `wg set wg0 peer ABCD persistent-keepalive 25`
    as well as `PersistentKeepalive = 25` in the `[Peer]` section of
    configuration files. This is off by default, as it's only useful for users
    behind NAT or stateful firewall that expect to receive external VPN
    connections while they are idle. This has been documented in the wg(8) man
    page as well as a small blurb on the quick start page of the website.
- removed patch:
  * wireguard-set-libmnl-includedir-with-pkgconfig.diff (fixed upstream)
