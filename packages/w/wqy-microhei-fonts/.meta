  <description>WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei, 
Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality 
CJK outline font. It was derived from &quot;Droid Sans Fallback&quot;, &quot;Droid 
Sans&quot; and &quot;Droid Sans Mono&quot; released by Google Corp. This font package
contains two faces, &quot;Micro Hei&quot; and &quot;Micro Hei Mono&quot;, in form of a 
True-Type Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e. 
GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1 
are covered, with additional support to many other international 
languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font 
file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts. 
As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or 
used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both 
font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs, 
they are the excellent choices for desktop fonts.</description>
