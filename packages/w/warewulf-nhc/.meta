  <title>Warewulf Node Health Check (NHC)</title>
  <description>Warewulf Node Health Check (NHC) is a periodic &quot;node health check&quot; script to be executed on each compute node to verify that the node is working properly. Nodes which are determined to be &quot;unhealthy&quot; can be marked as down or offline so as to
prevent jobs from being scheduled or run on them. This helps increase the reliability and throughput of a cluster by reducing preventable job failures due to misconfiguration, hardware failures, etc.</description>
