    <comment>- updated to 1.4.3 with following new features:
  * toggle BASH tracing or NHC debugging via SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2, respectively
  * check_nvsmi_healthmon(): New check from CSC for GPU health monitoring via
    nvidia-smi
  * Provide added detail to tracing info (-x mode)
  * Based on feedback from Moe Jette of SchedMD, pull node job data directly
    from Slurm via squeue instead of the previous method that only worked for
    single-node jobs.
  * Support for recent additions to the Slurm node states (e.g., &quot;planned&quot;)
  * Pathname expansion has been disabled on startup, and re-enabled only when
    being actively used, to avoid &quot;unintended&quot; expansions of wildcards at
    random points throughout the code.
  * Correct clobbering of BASH built-in variables and add tests to prevent future recurrence
  * Switch &quot;system UID&quot; boundary handling to a more accurate source of truth,
    and ensure that the code matches the math, naming, and intent.
  * Reorder resource manager detection to improve accurate detection,
    especially with respect to Slurm vs. PBS (all variants)
