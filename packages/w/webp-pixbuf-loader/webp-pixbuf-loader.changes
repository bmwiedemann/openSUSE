- Drop gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer Requires: only needed for directory
  ownership (and deprecated).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  6 01:36:36 UTC 2024 - Joshua Smith <smolsheep@opensuse.org>

- Enable tests
- Update to 0.2.7:
  * Fixes prepare/Update signal emitions and support for 0ms frames
- Updates from 0.2.6:
  * meson.build file had >1.3.2 rather than >=1.3.2 as the required
    version for libwebp
- Updates from 0.2.5:
  * libwebp 1.3.2 onwards is a requirement now due to security
    vulnerability in libwebp
- Updates from 0.2.4:
  * Improves gdk_pixbuf_get_file_info performance by not doing any
    allocations.
- Updates from 0.2.3:
  * fix crash when jpeg is named as .webp
- Updates from 0.2.2:
  * adds ICC profile data read support, when a webp file includes
    ICC data it embeds the data encoded as base64 into the
    GdkPixbuf object as an option. The data can be retrieved using
    gdk_pixbuf_get_option(pixbuf, "icc-profile");
- Updates from 0.2.1:
  * Adds ICC profile support through the "icc-profile" property
    encoded in base64 for all gdk_pixbuf_save operations
  * Fixes a crash when NULL is passed to the GError** to save
    operations
- Updates from 0.2.0:
  * This release brings all the same features, improves testing,
    does not require endian specific code, and has removed a memory
    leak that was complicated to solve in the previous
    implementation.
- Updates from 0.1.2:
  * bring back save functionality
  * tests: add save test and rework test infrastructure
- Updates from 0.1.1:
  * simplify method naming and order implementations
  * configure decoder output to write in pixbuf
- Updates from 0.1.0:
  * Simplified implementation of both static and animated webp
    implementation
  * Fix: exchanging animation for static image leaks memory
- Updates from 0.0.7:
  * meson improvements and BSD compatibility
