%description
WavPack is an open audio compression format providing lossless, high-quality
lossy, and unique hybrid compression modes.

Lossless mode is ideal for archiving audio material or any other situation
where quality is paramount. The compression ratio depends on the source
material, but generally is between 30%% and 70%%.

The hybrid mode creates both, a relatively small, high-quality lossy file that
can be used all by itself, and a "correction" file that (when combined with the
lossy file) provides full lossless restoration. For some users, this means
never having to choose between lossless and lossy compression.
