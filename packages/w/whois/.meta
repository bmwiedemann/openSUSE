  <title>Whois Client Program</title>
  <description>This is a new whois (RFC 954) client rewritten from scratch by Marco
d'Itri. It is derived from and compatible with the usual BSD and RIPE
whois(1) programs. It is intelligent and can automatically select the
appropriate whois server for most queries. This package also contains
mkpasswd, a simple front-end to crypt(3).</description>
