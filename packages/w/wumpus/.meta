  <title>Faithful transcription of the 1974 Atari Wumpus game</title>
  <description>WUMPUS is a bit of retrocomputing nostalgia. It is an *exact* clone,
even down to the godawful user interface, of an ancient classic game.
This version fixes two minor bugs in my original 1992 USENET posting
of the source. Superhack is a structurally similar game with a
different premise.</description>
