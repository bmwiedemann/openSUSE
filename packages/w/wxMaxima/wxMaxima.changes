-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  1 09:38:41 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

  * Jump to the char containing the error on encountering
    unmatched parenthesis.
  * Try to place the cursor near the error in all other cases.
  * Attempt to mark the whole error message in red. This is bound
    to fail in some cases as maxima sometimes only sends part of
    an error message through the error() command. But it is better
    than nothing.

  * Recent files that currently don't exist are grayed out now.
  * A command-line switch that triggers evaluation on startup of
    wxMaxima.
  * Many Bug Fixes and Performance improvements.

    exchange data.
    Double-clicking this indicator opens up the network monitor.

    too.
  * Better indentation of if clauses and loops.
  * If the number is too long to display it now is still possible
    to copy it.

  * the with_slider type of commands now uses wxstatusbar() in
    order to provide progress information for the user.
  * Several scrolling fixes, again.
  * Two concurrent wxMaxima instances now no more overwrite each
    other's "Recent files" list.
  * If a error message or question arises or maxima finishes
    calculating and the window currently isn't active the
    operating system is asked to notify the user in a
    non-disrupting way. For the case of the end of a calculation
    this can be turned off.
  * The notification can be activated for the case that the window
    isn't active and maxima finishes calculating, too.
  * Invalid XML tags are now handled more gracefully
  * Deduplicated the code for saving .wxm files
  * content.xml files that have been extracted from a broken .wxmx
    file (e.G. using a text editor as UTF8-encoded TeXt without
    BOM can now be loaded by wxMaxima in order to reconstruct the
    worksheet.
  * MacOs: Upgrading from a previous version should no more cause
    crashes due to font issues.
  * MathJaX export can now be configured to instruct the html
    export to download MathJaX from a different URL: They moved
    the URL one can use and might do so again somewhere in the
    future.

    are no more hardcoded into the worksheet at evaluation time.
  * Anwers to maxima's questions are now remembered across
    sessions.

  * Massive speed-ups
  * File/Open can now import .mac and .out files from Xmaxima

    text.
  * A new "copy as plain text" right-click menu item that copies
    the input and output of a cell.

  + A TeX-like subscript notation: A_1 is now by default shown as
    an A with an 1 as subscript
  + High-quality icons for high-dpi screens.
  + Some broken .wxmx files generated with wxMaxima 13.04 and
    older will now automatically be repaired
  + Tried to make communication with maxima more stable
  + Debug: A monitor for the xml communication between maxima and
    wxMaxima
  + Leading White-space in front of a character that has to be
    escaped in XML is no more ignored.
  + jpeg-encoded images are now no more converted to much larger
    png files on saving .wxmx files and on exporting.
  + Images will now actually be converted to the target format.

    versions of wxmaxima will replace .jpg files embedded in .wxmx
    files by a placeholder on load
  + Increased both speed and memory-efficiency of image handling
  + Save the zoom factor at exit and reload it on opening a new file
  + An option that makes wxMaxima use user-defined labels instead
    of %o where an user-defined label exists. Works well together
    with unchecking the "export code cells" config item.
  + A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  + The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start
    with a fresh instance of maxima

  + "#" now is shown as a "not equal" sign as a "not equal" sign
    already would be interpreted as "#".
  + Teach CCL on Windows how to deal with unicode variable names
    like ü and α. For SBCL the necessary change has been done on
    the maxima side.
  + Sidebars for symbols
  + Printing text cells now works again
  + The <ESC> key now works as a shortcut that closes the search
    dialogue.
  + A copy-to-MathML feature
  + Many bug, usability and performance fixes
  + Most importantly: If it is a cursor it now blinks.
- No longer rm .menu file, not bundled in upstream tarball any
  more.

Wed Aug 19 10:08:15 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 15.08.0:
  + MathJAX now provides scaleable equations and extended
    drag-and-drop for the html export.
  + The table-of-contents-sidebar now shows the current cursor
    position.
  + Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping out of the screen.
  + Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping to the beginning or
    end of the worksheet.
  + Better detection which cell maxima is processing and if it
    still is doing so.
  + Regression: Hiding the toolbar didn't work on some systems.
  + Markdown support for <=, >=, <=>, <-, ->, <->, => and +/-
    symbols.
  + An option to not export maxima's input as well as the output.
  + An option to use High-resolution bitmaps for the HTML export.
  + Images that are too big for the window now are displayed in a
    scaled-down version.
  + Fixed the support for out-of-tree-bulds that was broken in 15.04.
  + Meaningful ALT texts for the HTML export to provide accessibility.
  + An option to include the .wxmx file in the .html export.
  + Performance fixes that are espectionally effective for MSW
  + Unification of some platform-specific code.
  * bash autocompletion.
  + A fourth sectioning level.
  + Made entering uppercase greek letters easier and documented
    how to input special unicode symbols.
  + Syntax highlighting in code cells.
  + Automatic highlighting of text equal to the currrently
    selected one.
  + A batch mode that pauses evaluation if maxima asks a question.
  + A "halt on error" feature.
  + Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if
    evaluation of the last command has finished. This means that
    output from maxima is always appended to the right cell.
  + Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per
    cell. Sincewe now send maxima's input command-per-command this
    means a cell with multiple commands is no more evaluated
    faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  + If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new
    "trigger evaluation" menu entry in the maxima menu.
  + On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant
    that is based on the surprisingly powerful autocompletion
    feature.
  + Ctrl+Tab now launches the autocompletion (or content
    assistant, if available).
  + Tab and Shift+Tab now indent and unindent regions.
  + Ctrl+Mouse wheel and Ctrl++/- now zoom in and out of the
    worksheet.

    multiple cells.

  + F1 now selects the word under cursor if there's no selection, and 
    searches help for that word
