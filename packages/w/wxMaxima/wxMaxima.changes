    non-disrupting way. For the case of the end of a calculation
    this can be turned off.
  * The notification can be activated for the case that the window
    isn't active and maxima finishes calculating, too.
  * Invalid XML tags are now handled more gracefully
  * Deduplicated the code for saving .wxm files
  * content.xml files that have been extracted from a broken .wxmx
    file (e.G. using a text editor as UTF8-encoded TeXt without
    BOM can now be loaded by wxMaxima in order to reconstruct the
    worksheet.
  * MacOs: Upgrading from a previous version should no more cause
    crashes due to font issues.

- Add wxMaxima-appstream-xml-filename.patch: Fix the appstream xml

  upstream.
- Update file list accordingly:
  wxmaxima.appdata.xml -> wxMaxima.appdata.xml

- Update to version 16.04.1:
  + Bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  6 00:14:31 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 16.04.0:
  + A TeX-like subscript notation: A_1 is now by default shown as
    an A with an 1 as subscript
  + High-quality icons for high-dpi screens.
  + Some broken .wxmx files generated with wxMaxima 13.04 and
    older will now automatically be repaired
  + Tried to make communication with maxima more stable
  + Debug: A monitor for the xml communication between maxima and
    wxMaxima
  + Leading White-space in front of a character that has to be
    escaped in XML is no more ignored.
  + jpeg-encoded images are now no more converted to much larger
    png files on saving .wxmx files and on exporting.
  + Images will now actually be converted to the target format.
  + Bumped the minor version of the .wxmx format: Some old
    versions of wxmaxima will replace .jpg files embedded in .wxmx
    files by a placeholder on load
  + Increased both speed and memory-efficiency of image handling
  + Save the zoom factor at exit and reload it on opening a new file
  + An option that makes wxMaxima use user-defined labels instead
    of %o where an user-defined label exists. Works well together
    with unchecking the "export code cells" config item.
  + A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  + The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start
    with a fresh instance of maxima
  + TeX export now should work with most unicode chars we have ESC
    sequences for.
  + An auto-repair functionality that repairs most .wxmx files
    wxMaxima 13.04 was not able to open again.
  + A few new ESC sequences and markdown commands.
  + "#" now is shown as a "not equal" sign as a "not equal" sign
    already would be interpreted as "#".
  + Teach CCL on Windows how to deal with unicode variable names
    like ü and α. For SBCL the necessary change has been done on
    the maxima side.
  + Sidebars for symbols
  + Printing text cells now works again
  + The <ESC> key now works as a shortcut that closes the search
    dialogue.
  + A copy-to-MathML feature
  + Many bug, usability and performance fixes
  + Most importantly: If it is a cursor it now blinks.
- No longer rm .menu file, not bundled in upstream tarball any
  more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  8 12:49:33 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  3 06:42:50 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 15.08.1:
  + Bug fixes (undocumented).

  upstream (and removed from patch), one issue persists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 19 10:08:15 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 15.08.0:
  + MathJAX now provides scaleable equations and extended
    drag-and-drop for the html export.
  + The table-of-contents-sidebar now shows the current cursor
    position.
  + Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping out of the screen.
  + Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping to the beginning or
    end of the worksheet.
  + Better detection which cell maxima is processing and if it
    still is doing so.
  + Regression: Hiding the toolbar didn't work on some systems.
  + Markdown support for <=, >=, <=>, <-, ->, <->, => and +/-
    symbols.
  + An option to not export maxima's input as well as the output.
  + An option to use High-resolution bitmaps for the HTML export.
  + Images that are too big for the window now are displayed in a
    scaled-down version.
  + Fixed the support for out-of-tree-bulds that was broken in 15.04.
  + Meaningful ALT texts for the HTML export to provide accessibility.
  + An option to include the .wxmx file in the .html export.
  + Performance fixes that are espectionally effective for MSW
  + Unification of some platform-specific code.
  * bash autocompletion.
  + A fourth sectioning level.
  + Made entering uppercase greek letters easier and documented
    how to input special unicode symbols.
  + Syntax highlighting in code cells.
  + Automatic highlighting of text equal to the currrently
    selected one.
  + A batch mode that pauses evaluation if maxima asks a question.
  + A "halt on error" feature.
  + Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if
    evaluation of the last command has finished. This means that
    output from maxima is always appended to the right cell.
  + Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per
    cell. Sincewe now send maxima's input command-per-command this
    means a cell with multiple commands is no more evaluated
    faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  + If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new
    "trigger evaluation" menu entry in the maxima menu.
  + On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant
    that is based on the surprisingly powerful autocompletion
    feature.
  + Ctrl+Tab now launches the autocompletion (or content
    assistant, if available).
  + Tab and Shift+Tab now indent and unindent regions.
  + Ctrl+Mouse wheel and Ctrl++/- now zoom in and out of the
    worksheet.
  + Allow Extending selection from part of a single cell to
    multiple cells.
  + An Autoindent functionality.

    at the top of that cell's left bracket 
  + reorganised some menus 
  + cells can now be edited by single-click 
  + if you have a selection of text/code, ([{ will put ([{}]) around 
    selection and place cursor before first ([{, pressing }]) will put 
    the cursor after the last }]) 
  + double clicking will select the word under the cursor 
  + double clicking on (,[,{ or },],) will select the text/code between ([{ }]) 
  + F1 now selects the word under cursor if there's no selection, and 
    searches help for that word 
  + removed the INPUT line 
  + introduced a 'horizontal cursor': click between cells to set it, 
    start typing to insert a new input cell, press F6 to insert a new 
    text cell, SHIT-UP/DOWN or click'n'drag selects cells 
  + Maxima questions answered in the document - a cursor should appear, 
    SHIFT-ENTER sends your answer to Maxima. If a cursor doesn't appear, 
    click below the cell, type the answer and press SHIFT-ENTER
