    CMake: Set CMake Policy CMP0071 to NEW
    
    This policy says: "Since version 3.10, CMake processes regular and GENERATED
    source files in AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC. In earlier CMake versions, only regular
    source files were processed. GENERATED source files were ignored silently."
    
    We are currently running AUTOMOC/RCC/UIC on too many files unnecessarily and
    that should be improved. CMake 3.20 introduced some changes related with this
    that broke the build (issue #17314) and need further investigation.
    
    Meanwhile setting this policy to NEW shouldn't break anything and silences
    some noisy CMake warnings.
