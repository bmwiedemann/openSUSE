Tue Dec 20 12:45:39 UTC 2021 - Robert Frohl <rfrohl@suse.com>

- Wireshark 3.6.0:
  * CVE-2021-4186: Gryphon dissector crash (boo#1194165).
  * Several changes have been made to the display filter syntax:
    - The expression "a != b" now always has the same meaning as
      "!(a == b)". In particular this means filter expressions with
      multi-value fields like "ip.addr != 1.1.1.1" will work as
      expected (the result is the same as typing "ip.src != 1.1.1.1 and
      ip.dst != 1.1.1.1"). This avoids the contradiction (a == b and a!= b)
      being true.
    - It is possible to use the syntax "a ~= b" or "a any_ne b" to
      recover the previous (inconsistent with "==") logic for not equal.
    - Literal strings can now be specified using raw string syntax,
      identical to raw strings in the Python programming language. This
      can be used to avoid the complexity of using two levels of
      character escapes with regular expressions.
    - Set elements must now be separated using a comma. A filter
      such as http.request.method in {"GET" "HEAD"} must be written as ...
      in {"GET", "HEAD"}. Whitespace is not significant. The
      previous use of whitespace as separator is deprecated and will be
      removed in a future version.
    - Support for the syntax "a not in b" with the same meaning as
      "not a in b" has been added.
  * TCP conversations now support a completeness criteria, which
    facilitates the identification of TCP streams having any of
    opening or closing handshakes, a payload, in any combination. It
    can be accessed with the new tcp.completeness filter.
  * Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire or otherwise
    missing in capture files can now be displayed with default values
    by setting the new "add_default_value" preference. The default
    values might be explicitly declared in "proto2" files, or false
    for bools, first value for enums, zero for numeric types.
  * Wireshark now supports reading Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). A
    new extcap named ETW reader is created that now can open an etl
    file, convert all events in the file to DLT_ETW packets and write
    to a specified FIFO destination. Also, a new packet_etw dissector
    is created to dissect DLT_ETW packets so Wireshark can display
    the DLT_ETW packet header, its message and packet_etw dissector
    calls packet_mbim sub_dissector if its provider matches the MBIM
    provider GUID.
  * "Follow DCCP stream" feature to filter for and extract the contents of DCCP streams.
  * Wireshark now supports dissecting RTP packets with OPUS payloads.
  * Added support for Shared Memory Communications (SMC) (jsc#SLE-18727)

- update to 2.6.0
  * Bug Fixes
    - The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes. 
      (Bug 1419)
  * New and Updated Features
    The following features are new (or have been significantly 
    updated) since version 2.5.0:
    - HTTP Request sequences are now supported.
    - Wireshark now supports MaxMind DB files. Support for GeoIP
      and GeoLite Legacy databases has been removed.
    - The Windows packages are now built using Microsoft Visual 
      Studio 2017.
    - The IP map feature (the “Map” button in the “Endpoints” 
      dialog) has been removed.
    The following features are new (or have been 
    significantly updated) since version 2.4.0:
    - Display filter buttons can now be edited, disabled, and 
      removed via a context menu directly from the toolbar
    - Drag & Drop filter fields to the display filter toolbar or
      edit to create a button on the fly or apply the filter as 
      a display filter.
    - Application startup time has been reduced.
    - Some keyboard shortcut mix-ups have been resolved by 
      assigning new shortcuts to Edit → Copy methods.
    - TShark now supports color using the --color option.
    - The "matches" display filter operator is now case-insensitive.
    - Display expression (button) preferences have been converted 
      to a UAT. This puts the display expressions in their own file.
      Wireshark still supports preference files that contain the
      old preferences, but new preference files will be written
      without the old fields.
    - SMI private enterprise numbers are now read from the 
      “enterprises.tsv” configuration file.
    - The QUIC dissector has been renamed to Google QUIC 
      (quic → gquic).
    - The selected packet number can now be shown in the Status Bar 
      by enabling Preferences → Appearance → Layout → Show selected
      packet number.
    - File load time in the Status Bar is now disabled by default
      and can be enabled in 
      Preferences → Appearance → Layout → Show file load time.
    - Support for the G.729A codec in the RTP Player is now added 
      via the bcg729 library.
    - Support for hardware-timestamping of packets has been added.
    - Improved NetMon .cap support with comments, event tracing,
      network filter, network info types and some Message Analyzer
      exported types.
    - The personal plugins folder on Linux/Unix is now 
      ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins.
    - TShark can print flow graphs using -z flow…
    - Capinfos now prints SHA256 hashes in addition to RIPEMD160
      and SHA1. MD5 output has been removed.
    - The packet editor has been removed. (This was a GTK+ only 
      experimental feature.)
    - Support BBC micro:bit Bluetooth profile
    - The Linux and UNIX installation step for Wireshark will now 
      install headers required to build plugins. A pkg-config file
      is provided to help with this (see “doc/plugins.example” for 
      details). Note you must still rebuild all plugins between 
      minor releases (X.Y).
    - The Windows installers and packages now ship with Qt 5.9.4.
    - The generic data dissector can now uncompress zlib compressed 
      data.
    - DNS Stats now supports service level statistics.
    - DNS filters for retransmissions and unsolicited responses 
      have been added.
    - The “tcptrace” TCP Stream graph now shows duplicate ACKS and
      zero window advertisements.
    - The membership operator now supports ranges, allowing display
      filters such as tcp.port in {4430..4434} to be expressed. 
      See the User’s Guide, chapter Building display filter 
      expressions for details.
  * New Protocol Support    
  * Updated Protocol Support
    - Too many protocols have been updated to list here.
  * New and Updated Capture File Support
    - Microsoft Network Monitor
  * New and Updated Capture Interfaces support

Wed Aug 13 22:03:39 UTC 2014 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- Wireshark 1.12.0
- new and updated features since 1.10:
  * When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C
    <choplen> and/or -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible
    to also adjust the original frame length using the -L
    option.
  * You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap
    multiple times, which allows you to chop bytes from the
    beginning of a packet as well as at the end of a packet in
    a single step.
  * You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for
    editcap, which allows you to start chopping from that
    offset instead of from the absolute packet beginning or
    end.
  * "malformed" display filter has been renamed to
    "_ws.malformed". A handful of other filters have been given
    the "_ws." prefix to note they are Wireshark application
    specific filters and not dissector filters.
  * The Kerberos dissector has been replaced with an auto
    generated one from ASN1 protocol description, changing a
    lot of filter names.
  * Transport name resolution is now disabled by default.
  * Dissector output may be encoded as UTF-8. This includes
    TShark output.
- New and updated protocol and capture file support as listed in
  https://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-1.12.0.html
- major API changes
- packaging changes:
  * build with GTK+ 3 for openSUSE, GTK+ 2 on SLE 11

Wed Jun  5 21:08:57 UTC 2013 - andreas.stieger@gmx.de

- 1.10.0
- new or significantly updated features since version 1.8:
  * You can now display a list of resolved host names in "hosts" 
    format within Wireshark.
  * The wireless toolbar has been updated.
  * Wireshark on Linux does a better job of detecting interface 
    addition and removal.
  * It is now possible to compare two fields in a display filter 
    (for example: udp.srcport != udp.dstport). The two fields must
    be of the same type for this to work.
  * USB type and product name support has been improved.
  * All Bluetooth profiles and protocols are now supported.
  * Wireshark now calculates HTTP response times and presents the 
    result in a new field in the HTTP response. Links from the 
    request’s frame to the response’s frame and vice-versa are 
    also added.
  * The main welcome screen and status bar now display file sizes 
    using strict SI prefixes instead of old-style binary prefixes.
  * Capinfos now prints human-readable statistics with SI suffixes 
    by default.
  * It is now possible to open a referenced packet (such as the 
    matched request or response packet) in a new window.
  * Tshark can now display only the hex/ascii packet data without 
    requiring that the packet summary and/or packet details are also
    displayed. If you want the old behavior, use -Px instead of 
    just -x.
  * Wireshark can be compiled using GTK+ 3.
  * The Wireshark application icon, capture toolbar icons, and other 
    icons have been updated.
  * Tshark’s filtering and multi-pass analysis have been reworked 
    for consistency and in order to support dependent frame 
    calculations during reassembly. See the man page descriptions 
    for -2, -R, and -Y.
  * Tshark’s -G fields2 and -G fields3 options have been eliminated. 
    The -G fields option now includes the 2 extra fields that
    -G fields3 previously provided, and the blurb information has been
    relegated to the last column since in many cases it is blank 
    anyway.
  * Wireshark dropped the left-handed settings from the preferences.
    This is still configurable via the GTK settings (add 
    "gtk-scrolled-window-placement = top-right" in the config file, 
    which might be called /.gtkrc-2.0 or /.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini).
  * Wireshark now ships with two global configuration files: Bluetooth, 
    which contains coloring rules for Bluetooth and Classic, which
    contains the old-style coloring rules. 
  * The LOAD() metric in the IO-graph now shows the load in IO
    units instead of thousands of IO units.
- packaging changes
  * drop wireshark-suidflags.patch
    -fPIE and -pie now set on SUID binaries by upstream
     no longer require or call call autoreconf
  * wireshark-1.2.4-enable_lua.patch refreshed with upstream changes
    to wireshark-1.10.0-enable_lua.patch
  * drop include.filelist, instead find files for -devel package
    during build

    can adjust some column preferences by right-clicking the
    column header.
  + Preliminary Python scripting support has been added.
  + Many memory leaks have been fixed.
  + Packets can now be ignored (excluded from dissection), similar
    to the way they can be marked.
  + Manual IP address resolution is now supported.
  + Columns with seconds can now be displayed as hours, minutes
    and seconds.
  + You can now set the capture buffer size on UNIX and Linux if
    you have libpcap 1.0.0 or greater.
  + TShark no longer needs elevated privileges on UNIX or Linux to
    list interfaces. Only dumpcap requires privileges now.
  + Wireshark and TShark can enable 802.11 monitor mode directly
    if you have libpcap 1.0.0 or greater.
  + You can play RTP streams directly from the RTP Analysis
    window.
  + Capinfos and editcap now respectively support time order
    checking and forcing.
