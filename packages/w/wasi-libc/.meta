  <description>WASI Libc is a libc for WebAssembly programs built on top of WASI system calls. It provides a wide array of POSIX-compatible C APIs, including support for standard I/O, file I/O, filesystem manipulation, memory management, time, string, environment variables, program startup, and many other APIs.

WASI Libc is sufficiently stable and usable for many purposes, as most of the POSIX-compatible APIs are stable, though it is continuing to evolve to better align with wasm and WASI.</description>
