    <comment>- Update to 0.6.2
  + Lua fixes:
    * Added the no-op command, this allows the user to register a keybinding but not yet make it do anything. #363
  + Tiling bug fixes:
    * dmenu will no longer render as too tall #355
    * Scrollbars and other small windows no longer have weird visual artifacts #364
    * All popup windows should now be properly focused on the screen #218
- Add missing BuildRequires
- Use pkgconfig
  Thanks to luke_nukem
- Add vendored depdendencies vendor.tar.xz
- Add more build requirements
- Update to 0.6.1:
  * This version introduces two new features:
  The ability to unbind keybindings and to allow passthrough 
  for keybindings. See #345 for more details.
  * Root level containers have always have borders now. #315
  * If XDG_RUNTIME_DIR doesn't exist, an error explaining that is logged. #310
  * Screen scraping doesn't scrape active output (needs v0.2 of wc-grab) #349
  * Nested sub containers do not render borders properly when using new container command when a new container can't be spawned (e.g when there's one child) #344
  * Popup windows are no longer sized incorrectly #337
  * Popup windows should now be always centered on the screen correctly #218
  * Switching containers to a new workspace will no longer cause it to be invisible on a workspace that is not active. If it is moved to an inactive workspace, that one is made visible instead #333
  * Floating windows now update their focused colour correctly #320
  * Floating sub windows (e.g right click menus) no longer spawn with borders #319
  * Floating windows (such as dmenu) are no longer hidden when spawned in a tabbed/stacked container #317
  * Nested Tabbed/Stacked borders are now rendered correctly #313

    <comment>- Update to 0.7.0:
  * Note that all of the extension programs (wc-bg, wc-lock, and wc-grab) have backward incompatible changes in this release. Previous versions will not work as expected!
  * The background program binary has been renamed to wc-bg (originally way-cooler-bg)
  * The lockscreen program no longer uses a hack in order to render but uses a modified version of the desktop-shell protocol
  * Can now choose whether root containers have borders or not
  * See full changelog https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/blob/master/changelog/v0.7.0.md</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 0.8.0:
  * Changed the format for colours in the init.lua file. No longer
  accepts a number and instead should be a string. This is backwards incompatible.
