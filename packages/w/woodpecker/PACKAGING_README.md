# Packaging woodpecker

This server package needs assets generated by the `Makefile` that is present in
this package.  To do that, you need to have `make` and either the
`nodejs-common` or the `pnpm` package installed locally.

1. Change the version in the `_service` file
2. Enable `pnpm` by running `sudo corepack enable pnpm` (or install the `pnpm`
   package)
3. Run `make`
4. Create a changelog entry
5. Commit the changes as usual

For the OBS workflow you also need `obs-service-go_modules` as well
as `obs-service-tar_scm` and `obs-service-recompress`.
