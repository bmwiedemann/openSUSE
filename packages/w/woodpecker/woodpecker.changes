- Update to version 2.7.3:
  * Important
    To secure your instance, set WOODPECKER_PLUGINS_PRIVILEGED to
    only allow specific versions of the
    woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx plugin, use version 5.0.0 or
    above. This prevents older, potentially unstable versions from
    being privileged.
    For example, to allow only version 5.0.0, use:
      WOODPECKER_PLUGINS_PRIVILEGED=woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx:5.0.0
    To allow multiple versions, you can separate them with commas:
      WOODPECKER_PLUGINS_PRIVILEGED=woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx:5.0.0,woodpeckerci/plugin-docker-buildx:5.1.0
    This setup ensures only specified, stable plugin versions are
    given privileged access.
