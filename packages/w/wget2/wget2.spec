%description
Wget enables you to retrieve WWW documents or FTP files from a
server. This can be done in script files or via the command line.

In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to HTTP
zlib compression, parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since
HTTP header. HTTP/2 has been implemented. Wget2 also consumes less
system and user CPU cycles than Wget1.x.
