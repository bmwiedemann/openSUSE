    needs to return a code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 1.2.14:
  * grpc: Use 1.44 instead of 1.46 for now - there is a polling
    issue in 1.46+ that causes excessive CPU use.
- Add warpinator-safe-destination.patch: Fix transfer destinations
  so they cannot overwrite files/dirs outside of upload directory
  [bsc#1203463, CVE-2022-42725].
- Pass sysconfdir=%{_distconfdir} to meson for openSUSE >= 1550;
  this moves the autostart file to the more appropriate location:
  /usr/etc instead of /etc; there are no conf files that are
  installed to /etc anyway.
- Drop polkit privileges file: We do not have ufw in the distro,
  so this is pretty much useless for us anyway.
- Drop BuildRequires: python3-grpcio-tools, not required.

  * transfers: Improve on 069cf5f57e6 by creating a generator
    object to wrap the origin response instead of returning two
    objects.
- Drop warpinator-libexec-dir.patch: openSUSE uses
  %_prefix/libexec for %_libexecdir now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
