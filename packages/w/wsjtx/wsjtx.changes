Wed Jan 12 23:28:22 UTC 2022 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Updated to version 2.5.4
  * This is a bug fix  release. It has the following changes since
    release 2.5.3:
    + WSJTX: Repair a defect that caused occasional crashes when in
      QSO with stations using nonstandard callsigns.
    + MAP65: Allow MAP65 "Best-fit Delta phi" solution to be
      displayed to the user.
- Updated to version 2.5.3 (not released for Linux)
  * This release has the following changes since release 2.5.2:
    + Add a note in memory of G4WJS to the About window
    + Add a simple $DXCALL macro capability for Tx messages, and
      update the User Guide accordingly
    + Ensure that MAIN VFO is used for receiving on rigs that
      require it
    + Repair a defect in reporting low-confidence decodes to
      PskReporter

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 21 23:33:28 UTC 2021 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- Updated to version 2.5.2
  * This is mostly a bug fix  release.  It has the following changes
    since release 2.5.1:
    + Repair a longstanding regression that caused signal reports from
      tail-ended Tx2 messages to be omitted from logged information
    + Parse "dx-call-1 RR73; dx-call-2 <de-call> +nn" messages (i3=0,
      n3=1 DXpedition mode) in regular 77-bit modes
    + Repair a regression associated with setting the main window width
      on program startup.
    + Repair a problem with Q65 decodes of type 'q3' for messages of the
      form "<Call_1> Call_2"
    + Execute code associated with Q65 decodes of type 'q5' only when the
      Max Drift control is set to 50. This fix prevents
      double-incrementing of the message averaging counter on the first
      decoding sequence.
    + Polarization offset 'Dpol' from the astronomical data window is now
      written to file azel.dat if environment variable
      WSJT_AZEL_EXTRA_LINES has been defined as 1 or greater. Dpol is
      especially useful for EME on the higher microwave bands.
    + The Auto Log QSO option in "Settings->Reporting" now behaves the
      same as the Prompt to log QSO option when not in a special
      operating context mode.
    + The Fast/Normal/Deep setting in Q65 mode is now a sticky setting
      and is no longer reset to Fast on program startup or when Settings
      has been opened. The user selection is used for automatic decodes,
      but Deep is used for any subsequent manual decode attempts.
    + New hamlib code to correct minor flaws in controlling several rigs.
    + Update the  Chinese and Hong Kong translations of the user
      interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 18:59:59 UTC 2021 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- WSJT-X 2.3.1 General Availability release updates the User Guide
  to cover the new modes FST4 and FST4W along with sample .WAV files
  and decoding tutorials. This release also repairs a number of
  defects and regressions discovered since the v2.3.0  release,
  including those below.
  * When sending traffic to a  multicast UDP server ensure that the
    local loop-back interface is used if no others are selected.
  * Repair a defect in instance lock file handling that causes an
    infinite loop on start up.
  * Invert the PTT serial port sharing default behaviour, and

Tue Jun 23 22:55:38 UTC 2020 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- WSJT-X v2.2.2 is a bug fix release, mainly to incorporate the new RAC
  section PE into the FT8/FT4/MSK144 Contest Mode for Field Day.
  * Stations intending to operate in Field Day (FD) are urged to
    upgrade to this release, without it you cannot set your section to
    PE, and of equal importance you cannot decode contest messages from
    stations who are operating from PE without this upgrade.
  * FT8 decoder speeded up in Normal and Fast modes. This change gives
    a speed of decoding closer to that of v2.1.2 without compromising
    the number of decodes. It is particularly targeted for slower
    single board computer users such as the Raspberry Pi Model 3 or
    similar.
  * Thanks to our user interface language translation contributors for
    many improvements to the translated strings.
  * The DX Grid field is now cleared automatically when the DX Call
    field is changed. Care should be taken to complete entry of a
    callsign before entering a grid square.
- WSJT-X v2.2.1 is a bug fix release that fixes regressions found in the
  prior v2.2.0 release.
  * Incorporate a revised Hamlib version the address a regression in
    rig control of some rigs including the Yaesu FT-991 and FT-891.
  * Repair a defect in 6 character gridsquare lookup from the CALL3.TXT
    database, and improve "Lookup" button processing.
  * Repair a defect with selecting Wide Graph 2D spectrum types in
    translated UIs.
  * Repair a regression that blocked the Highlight Callsign UDP request
    from highlighting terms including a '+' character.
  * Repair a defect that caused hash code lookups of one's own call to
    fail after an extended period of inactivity, when operating with a
    non-standard callsign.
  * Repair  a  regression  where   occasional  Highlight  Callsign  UDP
    requests with the 'Highlight last'  parameter as true highlighted a
    match in a prior period. This fix include a performance improvement
     when  processing any  Highlight  Callsign  request with  'Highlight
    last' as true.
  * Include support for the Yaesu FT-920 when controlled by Ham Radio
    Deluxe. This change inadvertently missed the v2.2.0 GA release.
  * Correct a documentation issue with the UDP Message Protocol
    Status(1) message Special Operations Mode enumeration values ("WW
    DIGI added", Fox, and Hound renumbered). Thanks to Sam, W2JDB, for
    raising this issue.
  * Updated Catalan UI translation, tnx Xavi, EA3W.
  * Italian UI translation, tnx Marco, PY1ZRJ.
  * Updated Spanish UI translation, tnx Cedric, EA4AC. 
- WSJT-X 2.2 is a program upgrade that provides a number of new
  features and capabilities.
  * Significant improvements to the decoders for FT4, FT8, JT4,
    JT65 and WSPR.
  * New format for "EU VHF Contest" Tx2 and Tx3 messages
  * Keyboard shortcuts have been added as an aid to accessibility:
    Alt+R sets Tx4 message to RR73, Ctrl+R sets it to RRR.
  * the "inverted goal posts" marking Rx frequency on the Wide Graph's
    frequency scale are now rendered in a darker shade of green.
  * User Interface Translations have been enabled.  Translations are
    now available for Catalan, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Hong
    Kong Chinese.
  * "Save None" now writes no .wav files to disk, even temporarily.
  * An explicit entry for "WW Digi Contest" has been added to
    "Special operating activities" on the "Settings | Advanced" tab.
  * Contest mode FT4 now always uses RR73 for the Tx4 message.
  * The Status bar now displays the number of decodes found in the
    most recent Rx sequence.
  * The "Highlight Callsign" UDP message has been enhanced to allow
    clearing of old highlighting for a specified callsign. Please note
    a recommended restriction on the use of this message in the
    documentation here: https://tinyurl.com/y85nc3tg

Sat Dec 22 19:34:02 UTC 2018 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

- update to WSJT-X v2.0.0 GA release
- WSJT-X 2.0 is a major update that introduces new protocols for
  FT8 and MSK144. The new protocols become the world-wide standards
  on December 10, 2018. WSJT-X 2.0 cannot communicate in these modes
  with other stations using WSJT-X v1.9.1 or earlier.
- New features since WSJT-X v1.9.1:
1. Compound and nonstandard callsigns are automatically recognized
   and handled using new message formats.
2. The new FT8 protocol provides optimized message formats for
   North American VHF contests, European VHF contests, ARRL Field
   Day, and ARRL RTTY Roundup.  Similarly, the new MSK144 protocol
   provides optimized message formats for North American VHF and
   European VHF contests. Full support is provided for "/R" and
   "/P" calls in the relevant contests.
3. The new protocols provide nearly equal (or better) sensitivity
   compared to the old ones, and lower false decode rates.
4. New logging features are provided for contesting and for "Fox"
   (DXpedition) mode.  Logging is optionally integrated with N1MM
   Logger+ and WriteLog.
5. Color highlighting of decoded messages provides worked-before
   status for callsigns, grid locators, DXCC entities, continents,
   CQ Zones, and ITU zones on a “by band” and “by mode” basis, and
   for stations that have uploaded their logs to Logbook of the
   World (LoTW) within a specified time interval.
6. The WSPR decoder now achieves decodes down to S/N = -31 dB.  For
   the particular benefit of LF/MF users, an option "No own call
   decodes" has been added.
7. The UDP messages sent to companion programs have been expanded
   and improved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  8 22:50:01 UTC 2018 - Wojciech Kazubski <wk@ire.pw.edu.pl>

8.  Improved decoding performance for WSPR mode, especially effective at
    LF and MF
9.  Improved waterfall sensitivity for very weak signals
10. Optional forwarding of logged information to N1MM Logger+
11. Expanded and improved UDP messages sent to companion programs
12. Allow partial processing of incoming UDP Reply messages so that
    non-CQ/QRZ decodes can be processed. The processing is the same as
    double-clicking the same decoded message within WSJT-X except that
    "Enable Tx" will not be enabled.
13. Adjustable main-window geometry with a "splitter" between the two
    text panels.
14. Better support for macOS using hi-DPI Retina displays
15. Updated Hamlib functionality including changes to the Yaesu FT-817
    back end that allows the uBITx kit transceiver to be CAT controlled
    by WSJT-X.
16. Correct the display of DXCC status of KG4 calls
17. Decoded CQ calls where a prefix has been used as a suffix should
    have the DXCC entity name assigned correctly in almost all cases
18. Hamlib, support for TRX-Manager added.
19. Hamlib, improved support for FLRIG.
20. Updated copy of cty.dat

- update to WSJT-X v1.8.0 GA release
 1. New mode called FT8: sensitivity down to -20 dB on the AWGN
    channel; QSOs 4 times faster than JT65 or JT9; auto-sequencing
    includes an option to respond automatically to first decoded
    reply to your CQ.
 2. New mode for accurate Frequency Calibration of your radio.
 3. Improved performance of decoders for JT65, QRA64, and MSK144.
    MSK144 includes facilities for amplitide and phase equalization
    and an "SWL" mode for short-format messages.
 4. Options to minimize screen space used by Main and Wide Graph
    windows.
 5. Enhanced management scheme for table of operating frequencies, and
    a new set of default frequencies specific to the three IARU
    Regions.
 6. Improved CAT control for many rigs, including those controlled
    through Commander or OmniRig.
 7. New keyboard shortcuts to set "Tx even/1st" ON or OFF.
 8. A number of (mostly minor) bug fixes and tweaks to the user
    interface.  For example: new behavior for the audio level slider;
    correctly logged QSO start times in certain situations; correct
    control of FT-891/991 and some other radios via rigctld.
