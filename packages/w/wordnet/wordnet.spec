%description
WordNet is a large lexical database of English.
Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets
of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets
are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The
resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated
with the browser.
WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and
natural language processing.
