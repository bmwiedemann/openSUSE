Tue Sep 10 13:17:45 UTC 2024 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.11.10:
  * Removed a few unused variables which gcc reported during
    building with -Wall compiler option. A notable case was in
    function decode_wv_datetime where a memory allocation
    failure was ignored
  * Added workaround for buggy FindEXPAT in cmake 3.27-3.29.
  * Enabled --output-on-failure in GitHub runner config of ctest.
  * Removed proprietary Testing.cmake.
  * Updated the cmake package information by replacing the find
    module with proper cmake config and version files.
  * Removed all cmake find modules of third party dependencies.
  * Replaced proprietary FindCheck.cmake with standard usage of
    PkgConfig.
  * Removed assert in function wbxml_tree_clb_xml_end_element of
    wbxml_tree_clb_xml.c. The function had already the
    correct error handling implemented. The library no longer
    crashes but returns an error.
  * Fixed SIGSEGV during parsing of malformed WV document in
    wbxml_parser.c.
  * Fixed the handling of a wrong Unicode character in the
    function parse_entity of wbxml_parser.c. The library no longer
    crashes but returns an error. Therefore, a new error was
    defined in wbxml_errors.h. The usage of assert.h was removed
    from wbxml_parser.c.
  * Added missing NULL pointer check in function
    decode_opaque_content of wbxml_parser.c
  * Added a directory for and with fuzz tests which crash(ed) the
    library.
  * Modify wbxml_getopt return opt type to int
  * Check for normalize_xml.pl failures in the tests (pull
    request #84).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  6 14:42:37 UTC 2022 - Dirk M端ller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.11.8:
  * Changed location of releases to GitHub only in README.
  * Change the default internal namespace separator from the colon to the pipe
    This solves compatibility with libexpat >= 2.4.5 after fix the security
    problem CVE-2022-25236.
  * Removed copy of Expat in macosx directory (issue #77).
  * Migrated from Travis CI to GitHub actions for testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 11 11:38:20 UTC 2021 - Bo Simonsen <bosim@opensuse.org>

- fixed spec file syntax
- updated to version 0.11.7
  * Added WBXML_INSTALL_FULL_HEADERS cmake flag to expose internal
    API headers; changes library version for compatibility (e.g.
    2.6.1 -> 20601.0.0)
    (pull request #67 from David Llewellyn-Jones)
  * Link to libexpat correctly (private). Therefore the tools
    wbxml2xml and xml2wbxml do no longer link directly to libexpat.
    (pull request #65 from Peter Keresztes Schmidt)
  * Fixed several memory leaks and leak-sanitizer issues.
    (pull requests #61, #62, #63 and #64 from Gaurav Gupta)
  * During build use headers which come with source code and not
    the installed headers.
    (pull request #66 from David Llewellyn-Jones)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 13 13:55:16 UTC 2019 - bosim@opensuse.org

- updated to version 0.11.6
  * Fixed/changed the encoding of element Content in CodePage
    AirSyncBase (0x11) to WBXML_BINARY_OPTION for Microsoft
    ActiveSync.
    This element is used when the clients send a request to save a
    draft email.
    An example can be found in:
    http://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-ASEMAIL/[MS-ASEMAIL].pdf
    (4.4 Adding a Draft Email with Attachments).
    Reference:
    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt563406%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx
    (issue #58 from Thomas F端hrer)
  * Added a testcase for Microsoft ActiveSync EAS Provisioning
    (clarifies issue #56).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 15 12:22:18 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim descriptions
- Replace unnecessary uses of %__ indirections in macros,
  remove redundant %clean section, do parallel build with %_smp_mflags.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 19 14:27:59 UTC 2017 - bosim@opensuse.org

- updated to version 0.11.5
  * Fixed ActiveSync element data of code pages ResolveRecipients and
    GAL (issue #52 from Thomas F端hrer, fixed in pull request #53).
  * Added definitions of ActiveSync protocoll v16.0 (pull request #32 from Gil Hartmann).
  * Added support to build a static library (issue #22 and pull requests #23, #24, #25,
    #26 and #27 from Gaurav Gupta).
  * Added support for MacOS X to Travis CI environment.
  * Added support for ccache (pull request #44 from Gaurav Gupta).
  * Fixed some memory leaks (pull requests #43 and #45 from Renu Tyagi).
  * Avoid malloc typecasts (pull requests #31, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39 and #40 from Gaurav Gupta).
  * Added support for automated testing with travis-ci.org
  * Fixed memory leak in function wbxml_strtbl_collect_words of wbxml_encoder (pull request #21 from Gaurav Gupta).
  * Fixed memory leak in function wbxml_strtbl_check_references of wbxml_encoder (pull request #20 from Gaurav Gupta).
  * If pkg-config is used then use the provided ldflags (pull request #19 from Jeroen Dekkers).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 11:43:23 CET 2011 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.9
  * Added correct default behaviour to parse_charset. If no character
    set is specified in a WBXML document then UTF-8 is assumed until
    there is another specification in the transport meta-information.
    (ticket #52)
  * Added several tokens for Microsoft ActiveSync v14.0 revision 8.0
    (ticket #53). The patch was supplied by Amnon Aaronsohn.
  * Fixed iconv support (ticket #52)
  * Fixed wrong WBXML table token for OMA DM DDF (ticket #51)
  * Fixed locations of variable definitions and replaced strtoull by
    strtoul (changes from ticket #42 and #50).
    This fixes some compiler errors from MS VisualStudio 2008 and 9.0.
  * Fixed integer overflow in opaque data parsing (ticket #54).
    The patch was supplied by Amnon Aaronsohn.
  * Fixed unsigned integer overflow (patch from ticket #41)
    The overflow causes crashs or wrong wbxml messages.
  * Added support for recursion in wbxml_tree_node_elt_get_from_name
    (ticket #46)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 13:57:54 CEST 2010 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.8
  * Added a fix for the broken vFormat handling in the SyncML
    specification. All LFs are replaced by CRLFs in every vFormat
    object inside a SyncML message (ticket #38).
  * Added Nokia ConML support (ticket #35).
    There is no public documentation available from Nokia. The
    transformation tables were created from sniffed WBXML documents.
    The patch was supplied by Anton D. Kachalov.
  * Removed OMA DM tests because the OMA did not grant a permission
    for the inclusion (ticket #36).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  3 08:42:34 UTC 2009 - cstender@novell.com

- removed ddf testcases (bnc#515194)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 13 17:52:02 CEST 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.7
  * If the operating system environment has a built-in getopt
    implementation then the cmake environment disables the internal
    implementation of libwbxml and uses the getopt function of the
    operating system. This avoids clashes with variables which are
    declared extern and explicit but already exists in the default
    POSIX header files (e.g. optopt).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 24 18:54:47 CEST 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.6
  * Extended (updated) tables for Microsoft AirSync
    (The patch was supplied by Ossi Jormakka from Ixonos Plc.)
  * Expat splits &lt;html&gt; into three separate text nodes.
    Therefore it is necessary to scan for splitted text nodes and
    merge them into a single consistent text node.
  * Fixed race condition in WV datetime opaque encoding

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 30 15:56:01 CEST 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.5
  * Fixed library installation path for win32 (ticket #31)
    (The patch was supplied by Jeremy Laine.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 12:36:07 CET 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.4
  * Fixed the byte order of the WV datetime opaque encoding (the bytes
    were written in the reversed order)
  * Fixed the time zone byte handling in the WV datetime opaque encoding
    (e.g. A means UTC+1, Z must be 0x5a) (ticket #30)
  * Added correct timezone handling for WV datetime opaque parser
  * Added support for WV datetime inline encoding. All timestamps which
    use the full ISO style like 2001-09-12T13:09:12+02:00 are encoded
    as inline strings. This style is strongly recommended because time
    zones like UTC+09:30 of Darwin in Australia are supported too.
    (ticket #30)

  * Added support for an EXPECTED value to the XML normalization script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 23 16:32:53 CET 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.3
  * Added support for SourceParent in SyncML 1.1.
    This is a proprietary extension to support things like the SMS and
    bookmark synchronization of Nokia.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 13 13:04:07 CET 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.2
  * Added support for OMA DM DDF 1.2 (ticket #7).
  * DRMREL 1.0 test cases were disabled because of the poor
    specification (e.g. hard coded names for XML namespaces and
    definition of such namespaces as (WB)XML attributes).
  * The generated XML documents of the most tests (conversion from XML
    to WBXML back to XML) are compared with the original documents.
    Only special tests are not covered (e.g. hexadecimal number
    conversion, SyncML CDATA usage).

  * If there is no PUBLIC ID then DOCTYPE must include PUBLIC "" or
    SYSTEM. libwbxml always adds SYSTEM in this case.
  * Fixed datetime support for Wireless Village (ticket #27).
  * Extension tokens must not be replaced within normal text data
    (ticket #26).
  * Ticket #13 was rejected because the mentioned specification is only
    a today outdated OMA change request. Perhaps a new specification
    must be implemented in case of a new request.

  * Created a script to normalize XML documents.
  * The getopt implementation was replaced because of a potential
    license issue. This fixed a Solaris build issue too (ticket #25).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  9 11:28:58 CET 2009 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to version 0.10.1
  * LIBDATA_INSTALL_DIR was introduced (used by pkgconfig).
  * The installation of the documentation can be disabled.
  * All tests are executed as standalone tests to get more
    detailed informations if a test fails.
  * Removed a useless buffer which only creates a memory leak.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 16 13:53:17 CET 2008 - cstender@suse.de

- updated to libwbxml 0.10.0
  * libwbxml is now maintained by the OpenSync project
  * the new homepage is http://libwbxml.opensync.org
  * Build system switched to cmake from GNU autotools.
  * Tests were integrated and can be used via make test.
  * Fixed a couple of issues with SyncML

  * Fixed segfault in wbxml_encoder.c - Thanks Stijn van Drongelen
  * Size changed to MaxSize in OMA DS 1.2 DevInf
  * Fixed ticket #14 with patch from ticket (hexadecimal integer support
    for Wireless-Village)
  * Added datetime encoding support for Wireless-Village. (The encoder
    can tolerate missing seconds like in the tests.)
  * Added Sax like entity parsing
  * Namespaces support
  * Miscellaneous build fixes and anonymous document support
  * Fixed for wrong doctype detection
  * The inclusion of expat and iconv header files were moved to an
    internal header file.
  * The configuration parameters which are relevant for users are placed
    in wbxml_config.h.
  * Fixed SO naming

- changed build env to cmake
- added wbxml2-tools subpackage
- updated license to LGPL v2.1 or later
- dropped patches (all included in libwbxml 0.10.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 18 18:00:35 CET 2008 - cstender@suse.de

- added patch (09-devinf-doctype.patch) from Michael Bell
  - The embedded DevInf document is now prefixed with correct doctype
    during internal XML to WBXML conversion. This leeds to correct
    DevInf 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 embedded WBXML. The old code always
    embeds a SyncML 1.2 DevInf (e.g. in a SyncML 1.1 message).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  7 17:11:19 CET 2008 - cstender@suse.de
