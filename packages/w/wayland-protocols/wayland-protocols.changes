- Update to version 1.27:
  + This release includes two new staging protocols:
    - Content type hint: This protocol enables clients to provide
      hints to the compositor about what kind of content it
      provides, allowing compositors to optionally adapt its
      behavior accordingly.

      clients about when the user is idle.

  + The text input protocol saw a clarification to an easily
    misinterpreted paragraph, which if interpreted in a different
    way than the new clarification makes clear hindered correct
    behavior from being implemented.
  + This is also the first release which mandates new protocol
    extensions to follow RFC 2119 wording.
  + Apart from has so far been mentioned, this release also comes

Sun May  9 17:31:47 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.21:
  * Also new with this release is the introduction of a new protocol phase
    that replaces the old "unstable" phase: "staging". The main purpose of
    this is making it more painless to transition a protocol from it's
    testing-in-production phase to declaring it stable. See README.md for
    details.

  * This release also introduces a new staging protocol: xdg-activation,
    meant to enable transferring focus between different toplevel surfaces.
    For example from a launcher to a launchee, or one focused application to
    another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  1 11:53:33 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  + This release includes the new governance document, describing
    how to introduce and update Wayland protocols in
    wayland-protocols. See the GOVERNANCE.md file for details.
- Changes from version 1.19:
  + This release includes a new xdg-shell protocol that adds
    support for repositioning already mapped popups. Methods of
    doing so with inter-surface synchronization has been left out,
    with the intention of addressing this with a protocol at a
    lower level.
  + Both the presentation time and xdg-shell protocol also got new
    attributes added meaning bindings using the enum and bitfield
    attributes will generate better result.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The license tag for the fullscreen shell was also corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 31 07:54:47 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

    point.
  * The popup semantics was changed to allow future extendability.
  * Toplevel parent-child relationship ambiguities were fixed.
  * Unmap/map semantics were better defined.
  * Various other ambiguities were fixed and documentation in

Tue Aug 22 09:09:49 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10:
  * This version introduces one new unstable protocol: xdg-output -
    a protocol meant for providing desktop centric concepts related
    to output and monitors to clients. It's for example intended to
    be used by Xwayland to be able to layout outputs on a logical
    pixel grid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 22:23:16 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9:
  * Keyboard shortcut inhibitation - a protocol meant for making it
    possible for virtual machine viewers, remote desktop clients
    etc, to be able to forward keyboard combinations such as
    Alt-Tab etc.
  * Xwayland keyboard grabbing - a protocol specifically targeted
    at enabling Xwayland to implement keyboard grabs.
- Update keyring, the previous one had expired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 17 17:15:31 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

    request for creating a buffer from a dmabuf without having to
    wait for an event, as well as an event advertising supported
    fourcc modifiers along with the supported formats.
  * A pkg-config file meant for when wayland-protocols is used as a
    git submodule (or otherwise not installed) was added.
  * Various grammar fixes and clarifications were also included in
    this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 21 17:31:21 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7
  * Includes the new version of the unstable xdg-shell v6 protocol.
  * The protocol have gone through extensive changes to how
    surfaces are created and mapped, and also adds a few features
    that was not possible before:
    - A client can now specify a minimum and/or maximum window
      geometry.
    - A client can now in a declarative manner position popup
      surfaces so that they will be visible to the user, e.g. by
      having them placed within the shell work area.
    - A client can map a popup without a grab; this intended to be
      used for relatively positioned child surfaces that should not
      be automatically dismissed, such as tooltips, and user
      interface elements like "popovers" in GTK+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 13 22:17:00 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

Mon May 23 22:23:27 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4:
  * This release include one new stable protocol extension:
    viewporter.
  * The viewporter porter has previously been known as "wl_scaler"
    and enables a client to crop and scale a surface server side.
    Clients and compositors previously implementing support for
    wl_scaler should adapt accordingly. See the corresponding XML
    file for details.
  * Other changes included in this release are various grammatical
    corrections to the presentation-time, tablet, relative-pointer,
    pointer-constraints, linux-dmabuf, input-method and
    fullscreen-shell protocols.
  * It's now also possible to use autotools build files to install
    on platforms where the host CPU is not recognized.
