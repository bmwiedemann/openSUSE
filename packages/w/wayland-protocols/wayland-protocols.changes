- Update to version 1.12:
  * This version includes the new stable version of the XDG Shell
    protocol. In short, the difference between the XDG Shell stable
    and the last unstable version include (among other things):
  * The base interface and the global exposed via the registry
    changed from zxdg_shell_v6 to xdg_wm_base.
  * Fullscreen semantics were better defined and geometry
    requirements relaxed to allow certain hardware optimizations.
  * The popup positioner was changed to allow positioning against a
    point.
  * The popup semantics was changed to allow future extendability.
  * Toplevel parent-child relationship ambiguities were fixed.
  * Unmap/map semantics were better defined.
  * Various other ambiguities were fixed and documentation in
    general was improved.
- Use autosetup macro, and drop make call, nothing is build anyway.

- Update to version 1.11:
  * This version includes a new unstable version of the xdg-foreign
    protocol. The new version fixes C++ incompatibility issues
    while making the interface request naming a bit more
    descriptive.
  * Use sysroot prefix for pkgdatadir variable.
- Drop wayland-protocols-sysroot-prefix-fix.patch: Fixed upstream.
- Cleanup with spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  9 18:34:47 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add wayland-protocols-sysroot-prefix-fix.patch: Use sysroot
  prefix for pkgdatadir variable. The pc_sysroot is automatically
  added to cflags and libs but not to 'pkg-config --variable'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 09:09:49 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10:
  * This version introduces one new unstable protocol: xdg-output -
    a protocol meant for providing desktop centric concepts related
    to output and monitors to clients. It's for example intended to
    be used by Xwayland to be able to layout outputs on a logical
    pixel grid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 22:23:16 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9:
  * Keyboard shortcut inhibitation - a protocol meant for making it
    possible for virtual machine viewers, remote desktop clients
    etc, to be able to forward keyboard combinations such as
    Alt-Tab etc.
  * Xwayland keyboard grabbing - a protocol specifically targeted
    at enabling Xwayland to implement keyboard grabs.
- Update keyring, the previous one had expired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 17 17:15:31 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8:
  * Bumped the linux dmabuf protocol version, introducing a new
    request for creating a buffer from a dmabuf without having to
    wait for an event, as well as an event advertising supported
    fourcc modifiers along with the supported formats.
  * A pkg-config file meant for when wayland-protocols is used as a
    git submodule (or otherwise not installed) was added.
  * Various grammar fixes and clarifications were also included in
    this release.

- Update to new upstream release 1.7
  * Includes the new version of the unstable xdg-shell v6 protocol.
  * The protocol have gone through extensive changes to how
    surfaces are created and mapped, and also adds a few features
    that was not possible before:
    - A client can now specify a minimum and/or maximum window
      geometry.
    - A client can now in a declarative manner position popup
      surfaces so that they will be visible to the user, e.g. by
      having them placed within the shell work area.
    - A client can map a popup without a grab; this intended to be
      used for relatively positioned child surfaces that should not
      be automatically dismissed, such as tooltips, and user
      interface elements like "popovers" in GTK+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 13 22:17:00 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6:

      screensaver, etc)

Mon May 23 22:23:27 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4:
  * This release include one new stable protocol extension:
    viewporter.
  * The viewporter porter has previously been known as "wl_scaler"
    and enables a client to crop and scale a surface server side.
    Clients and compositors previously implementing support for
    wl_scaler should adapt accordingly. See the corresponding XML
    file for details.
  * Other changes included in this release are various grammatical
    corrections to the presentation-time, tablet, relative-pointer,
    pointer-constraints, linux-dmabuf, input-method and
    fullscreen-shell protocols.
  * It's now also possible to use autotools build files to install
    on platforms where the host CPU is not recognized.
