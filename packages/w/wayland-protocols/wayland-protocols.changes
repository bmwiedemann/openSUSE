Sun Mar  1 11:53:33 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.20:
  + This release includes the new governance document, describing
    how to introduce and update Wayland protocols in
    wayland-protocols. See the GOVERNANCE.md file for details.
- Changes from version 1.19:
  + This release includes a new xdg-shell protocol that adds
    support for repositioning already mapped popups. Methods of
    doing so with inter-surface synchronization has been left out,
    with the intention of addressing this with a protocol at a
    lower level.
  + Both the presentation time and xdg-shell protocol also got new
    attributes added meaning bindings using the enum and bitfield
    attributes will generate better result.

      for explicit per-surface buffer synchronization.
    - primary-selection: A clipboard like mechanism mimicking
      primary selection on X11, commonly known as
      "middle-click-paste".
  * The license tag for the fullscreen shell was also corrected.

    protocol. The new version is not compatible with the old
    version. Please check the commit adding the new protocols for

    transforms are handled.
  * The test suite was improved to catch issues detected by
    wayland-scanner.

- Update to version 1.12:
  * This version includes the new stable version of the XDG Shell
    protocol. In short, the difference between the XDG Shell stable
    and the last unstable version include (among other things):
  * The base interface and the global exposed via the registry
    changed from zxdg_shell_v6 to xdg_wm_base.
  * Fullscreen semantics were better defined and geometry
    requirements relaxed to allow certain hardware optimizations.
  * The popup positioner was changed to allow positioning against a
    point.
  * The popup semantics was changed to allow future extendability.
  * Toplevel parent-child relationship ambiguities were fixed.
  * Unmap/map semantics were better defined.
  * Various other ambiguities were fixed and documentation in
    general was improved.
- Use autosetup macro, and drop make call, nothing is build anyway.

- Update to version 1.11:
  * This version includes a new unstable version of the xdg-foreign
    protocol. The new version fixes C++ incompatibility issues
    while making the interface request naming a bit more
    descriptive.
  * Use sysroot prefix for pkgdatadir variable.
- Drop wayland-protocols-sysroot-prefix-fix.patch: Fixed upstream.
- Cleanup with spec-cleaner.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  9 18:34:47 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Add wayland-protocols-sysroot-prefix-fix.patch: Use sysroot
  prefix for pkgdatadir variable. The pc_sysroot is automatically
  added to cflags and libs but not to 'pkg-config --variable'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 22 09:09:49 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10:
  * This version introduces one new unstable protocol: xdg-output -
    a protocol meant for providing desktop centric concepts related
    to output and monitors to clients. It's for example intended to
    be used by Xwayland to be able to layout outputs on a logical
    pixel grid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 22:23:16 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9:
  * Keyboard shortcut inhibitation - a protocol meant for making it
    possible for virtual machine viewers, remote desktop clients
    etc, to be able to forward keyboard combinations such as
    Alt-Tab etc.
  * Xwayland keyboard grabbing - a protocol specifically targeted
    at enabling Xwayland to implement keyboard grabs.
- Update keyring, the previous one had expired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 17 17:15:31 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8:
  * Bumped the linux dmabuf protocol version, introducing a new
    request for creating a buffer from a dmabuf without having to
    wait for an event, as well as an event advertising supported
    fourcc modifiers along with the supported formats.
  * A pkg-config file meant for when wayland-protocols is used as a
    git submodule (or otherwise not installed) was added.
  * Various grammar fixes and clarifications were also included in
    this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to new upstream release 1.7
  * Includes the new version of the unstable xdg-shell v6 protocol.
  * The protocol have gone through extensive changes to how
    surfaces are created and mapped, and also adds a few features
    that was not possible before:
    - A client can now specify a minimum and/or maximum window
      geometry.
    - A client can now in a declarative manner position popup
      surfaces so that they will be visible to the user, e.g. by
      having them placed within the shell work area.
    - A client can map a popup without a grab; this intended to be
      used for relatively positioned child surfaces that should not
      be automatically dismissed, such as tooltips, and user
      interface elements like "popovers" in GTK+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 13 22:17:00 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6:
  * This release include two new unstable protocols:
    - xdg-foreign: reference a toplevel surface from another client
      and affect window manager relationship.
    - idle-inhibit: inhibit idle behaviour (screen blanking,
      screensaver, etc)

    few issues discovered in the first version, and also adds pad
    support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 23 22:23:27 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4:
  * This release include one new stable protocol extension:
    viewporter.
  * The viewporter porter has previously been known as "wl_scaler"
    and enables a client to crop and scale a surface server side.
    Clients and compositors previously implementing support for
    wl_scaler should adapt accordingly. See the corresponding XML
    file for details.
  * Other changes included in this release are various grammatical
    corrections to the presentation-time, tablet, relative-pointer,
    pointer-constraints, linux-dmabuf, input-method and
    fullscreen-shell protocols.
  * It's now also possible to use autotools build files to install
    on platforms where the host CPU is not recognized.
