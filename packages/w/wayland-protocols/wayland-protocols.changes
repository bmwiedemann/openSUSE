Mon Oct 10 21:03:51 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.27:
  + This release includes two new staging protocols:
    - Content type hint: This protocol enables clients to provide
      hints to the compositor about what kind of content it
      provides, allowing compositors to optionally adapt its
      behavior accordingly.
    - Idle notify: This extension allows compositors to notify
      clients about when the user is idle.
  + Apart from these two new extensions, this release also brings
    the usual clarifications, cleanups and fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 17 06:37:37 UTC 2022 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

Tue Jul 12 20:14:54 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.26:
  + This release introduces the new staging protocol single pixel
    buffer, which together with the viewporter extension enables
    clients to easily create arbitrarily sized single color
    surfaces.
  + Xdg-shell now also supports compositors announcing to surfaces
    some window management capabilities it supports.
  + The text input protocol saw a clarification to an easily
    misinterpreted paragraph, which if interpreted in a different
    way than the new clarification makes clear hindered correct
    behavior from being implemented.
  + This is also the first release which mandates new protocol
    extensions to follow RFC 2119 wording.
  + Apart from has so far been mentioned, this release also comes
    with the usual clarifications, improved annotations, and other
    minor fixes.

Sun May  9 17:31:47 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.21:
  * Also new with this release is the introduction of a new protocol phase
    that replaces the old "unstable" phase: "staging". The main purpose of
    this is making it more painless to transition a protocol from it's
    testing-in-production phase to declaring it stable. See README.md for
    details.

  * This release also introduces a new staging protocol: xdg-activation,
    meant to enable transferring focus between different toplevel surfaces.
    For example from a launcher to a launchee, or one focused application to
    another.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  1 11:53:33 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.20:
  + This release includes the new governance document, describing
    how to introduce and update Wayland protocols in
    wayland-protocols. See the GOVERNANCE.md file for details.
- Changes from version 1.19:
  + This release includes a new xdg-shell protocol that adds
    support for repositioning already mapped popups. Methods of
    doing so with inter-surface synchronization has been left out,
    with the intention of addressing this with a protocol at a
    lower level.
  + Both the presentation time and xdg-shell protocol also got new
    attributes added meaning bindings using the enum and bitfield
    attributes will generate better result.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The license tag for the fullscreen shell was also corrected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 31 07:54:47 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

  * This version includes the new stable version of the XDG Shell
    protocol. In short, the difference between the XDG Shell stable

    point.
  * The popup semantics was changed to allow future extendability.
  * Toplevel parent-child relationship ambiguities were fixed.
  * Unmap/map semantics were better defined.
  * Various other ambiguities were fixed and documentation in

Tue Aug 22 09:09:49 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.10:
  * This version introduces one new unstable protocol: xdg-output -
    a protocol meant for providing desktop centric concepts related
    to output and monitors to clients. It's for example intended to
    be used by Xwayland to be able to layout outputs on a logical
    pixel grid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 13 22:23:16 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.9:
  * Keyboard shortcut inhibitation - a protocol meant for making it
    possible for virtual machine viewers, remote desktop clients
    etc, to be able to forward keyboard combinations such as
    Alt-Tab etc.
  * Xwayland keyboard grabbing - a protocol specifically targeted
    at enabling Xwayland to implement keyboard grabs.
- Update keyring, the previous one had expired.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 17 17:15:31 UTC 2017 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.8:

    request for creating a buffer from a dmabuf without having to
    wait for an event, as well as an event advertising supported
    fourcc modifiers along with the supported formats.
  * A pkg-config file meant for when wayland-protocols is used as a
    git submodule (or otherwise not installed) was added.
  * Various grammar fixes and clarifications were also included in
    this release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 21 17:31:21 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.7
  * Includes the new version of the unstable xdg-shell v6 protocol.
  * The protocol have gone through extensive changes to how
    surfaces are created and mapped, and also adds a few features
    that was not possible before:
    - A client can now specify a minimum and/or maximum window
      geometry.
    - A client can now in a declarative manner position popup
      surfaces so that they will be visible to the user, e.g. by
      having them placed within the shell work area.
    - A client can map a popup without a grab; this intended to be
      used for relatively positioned child surfaces that should not
      be automatically dismissed, such as tooltips, and user
      interface elements like "popovers" in GTK+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 13 22:17:00 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 23 22:23:27 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4:
  * This release include one new stable protocol extension:
    viewporter.
  * The viewporter porter has previously been known as "wl_scaler"
    and enables a client to crop and scale a surface server side.
    Clients and compositors previously implementing support for
    wl_scaler should adapt accordingly. See the corresponding XML
    file for details.
  * Other changes included in this release are various grammatical
    corrections to the presentation-time, tablet, relative-pointer,
    pointer-constraints, linux-dmabuf, input-method and
    fullscreen-shell protocols.
  * It's now also possible to use autotools build files to install
    on platforms where the host CPU is not recognized.
