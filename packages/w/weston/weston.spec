%description
Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, and a
useful compositor in its own right. Weston has various backends that
lets it run on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input as well as
under X11. Weston ships with a few example clients, from simple
clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the protocol to more
complete clients and a simplistic toolkit. There is also a quite
capable terminal emulator (weston-terminal) and an toy/example
desktop shell. Finally, weston also provides integration with the
Xorg server and can pull X clients into the Wayland desktop and act
as a X window manager.

%description -n libweston-%major
This subpackage contains backend renderer plugins, used by
libweston-%major-0.

Summary:        The Weston compositor as a shared library
Group:          System/Libraries
Requires:       libweston-%major >= %version

%description -n libweston-%major-0
The libweston library is intended for use by other compositor efforts
(projects) that want to more easily utilize Weston's internal
functionalities. Weston's own reference compositor also makes use of
this.

%package -n libweston-desktop-%major-0
Summary:        The Weston compositor as a shared library
Group:          System/Libraries

%description -n libweston-desktop-%major-0
libweston-desktop provides an additional level of functionality of
relevance to compositors implementing a desktop metaphor style of
graphical interface. This library API is designed around xdg_shell
functionality, providing for handling of popups, window state, and
interfacing with Xwayland.
