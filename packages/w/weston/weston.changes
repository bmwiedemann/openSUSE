- Update to new upstream release 3.0
  * Improvement to the integration of drm_fb within the DRM
    compositor.
  * Make libdrm a non-optional build-time dependency
  * Handle multi-head repainting globally rather than per-output,
    with output routing rearranged a bit to allow slightly faster

    including unexporting the symbols
    weston_compositor_add_output and weston_output_update_matrix.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 05:17:56 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.12.0
* Weston's internal code has been restructured into a new
  software library, libweston. This is for use by other
  compositor efforts that want to more easily utilize Weston's
  internal functionalities. Weston's own compositor is now a user
  of this library.
* Another new library named libweston-desktop provides an
  additional level of functionality of relevance to compositors
  implementing a desktop metaphor style of graphical interface.
* Both libraries' APIs are subject to change.
* Support for the new version 6 of the xdg_shell protocol has been
  implemented in the Weston compositor.
* A pointer locking and confinement API is implemented for Weston
  using the wp_pointer_constraints protocol, to allow clients to
  define window regions to confine the pointer to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 08:32:54 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.11.0
* Fix crash when focused client doesn't have pointer resources.
* Fix crash on destruction of clients with two or more surfaces.
* Fix wrong background surface size and wrong panel width in
  hmi-controller.
* Fix bad pointer passed to memcpy in drm_output_choose_initial_mode.
* IVI: A large number of unnecessary API calls were dropped or
  simplified.
* Add new icons for weston terminal, flower, and editor clients.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 22:18:58 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.10
* add support for a number of recently added Wayland protocols:
  drag and drop actions, new frame and axis events, and buffer
  co-ordinates for surface damage.
* Touch input support is added.
- Update to new upstream relaese 1.9
* Input device hotplug is better polished, so it misbehaves less
  frequently when adding and removing keyboards and mice. This
  benefits multi-seat.
* weston shell: switched the middle and right mouse bindings, so
  that the more useful window resize functionality is accessed via
  the right button, and the less useful rotate-windows
  functionality is on the middle.
* The DRM compositor is now able to handle triple-head graphics
  cards, and other hardware with more than two output CRTCs per
  card. Various mode-setting improvements and fixes are also
  included.
* The weston-screensaver client is removed, in favor of just using
  simpler DPMS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 15:45:17 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.8.0
* Feature changes include: repaint scheduling, named outputs,
  output transformations, EGL improvements to gl-renderer,
  surface-shooting API, source clipping and view scissor in the
  pixman renderer, and adding Cut/Copy/Paste support to the
  editor.
* There is a new "headless rendering" test framework feature.
  This allows test cases to run weston synthetically, and instead
  of drawing to a physical monitor, to draw to an artificial
  monitor that is just an in-memory bitmap buffer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 10 12:04:57 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 1.7.0
  * Improve the look of shadows for small (<128 pixel wide or high)
    clients.  This resulted in observable dark lines in menus with
    fewer than 3 items.
  * A handful of fixes for xwm/Xwayland oddities, including better
    handling of popups/tooltips that to be top level, and better
    sizing of fullscreened X apps to not include the border in
    their height and
    width calculations.
  * An optimization to gl-renderer reduces the geometry needed for
    representing complex scenes, by utilizing pixman's y-x banded
    rectangles.
  * Memory allocation is cleaned up and standardized internally, to
    better demonstrate best practices in avoiding common leaks and
    crashes.
  * Doubleclicking on a window title bar now maximizes it.
  * Several fixes to glitches found during mode switching or
    restoring back to native.  And refactor the mode switching code
    into several specialized routines, so further mode switch
    handling can be done more flexibly.
  * Fix logind-util to do DRM-device synchronization only on DRM,
    and to pass the Activate signal immediately for other
    compositor backends.
  * Fix a couple problematic tests in the testsuite to skip in
    situations they're always going to fail.
  * Fix hang when closing the output if colord plugin is enabled
    due to an incorrect GMutex value in the mutex lock output
    notifier handler.
  * Multiple keyboard and pointer button events are better
    handled; we only forward the first and less press and
    release events, and suppress extraneous ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 27 21:47:25 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 19 20:38:34 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.6.0
* Xdg-shell protocol changes. [Changed again since 1.5.0.]
* Add weston_layer masking mechanism.
* keyboard repeat rate support, sent from compositor to clients,
  configurable.
* Use wl_display_add_socket_auto(): no need to specify the socket
  anymore when running Weston under Weston, it just works now.
* Exit Weston, if weston-desktop-shell dies too early. Should help with
  one class of "just black screen" problems.
* Option to force numlock on at start on DRM and fbdev backends.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 12 11:14:34 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.5.93
* Weston is now more picky about incorrect command line arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  8 12:58:51 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.5.92
* No changelog provided yet (comes with 1.6.0 later)
- Add 0001-build-honor-results-obtained-by-pkg-config-libinput.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 22 08:07:12 UTC 2014 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to new upstream release 1.5.0
* More work on xdg-shell, still not complete. The minimize feature
  was added.
* The weston input stack was split out as a new library, libinput.
  Weston can be configured to link to libinput for input but defaults
  to the built in input code for now.
* Weston now uses the new Xwayland server. The Xwayland code was
  refactored to be its own X server in the Xorg tree, similar to how
  Xwin and Xquartz and Xnest work.
* Animated window closing. A minor feature, but it validates the
  mechanism for keeping surfaces around after the client that created
  them goes away.
* Fullscreen shell. The fullscreen shell provides a mechanism for a
  single client to provide a fullscreen surface, for kiosk-mode or
  appliance type use cases.
* Weston now supports different color dephts on different outputs.
* Weston now uses non-recursive Makefiles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 24 12:08:08 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 1.4.0
* Window buttons for xwayland windows and proper decorations for
  the nested compositor
* Make the gl-renderer a loadable module and make it possible to
  switch from pixman to gl renderer at runtime. This lets the
  compositor start up faster, since we can load the gl-renderer
  and initialize EGL+GLES2 later in the startup.
* Support framebuffer formats other than XRGB8888
* Use logind for privileged access.  logind can now do the this
  that weston-launch used to do: drm drop/set master and opening
  input devices. With this, weston can run on KMS without the
  weston-launch setuid helper.
* Better output unplug handling.  We used to crash and in general
  not handle output (monitor) unplug at all. We now clean up
  properly and move windows back into the visible region when
  their output is unplugged.
* Keyboard focus animation and exposay (exposé-like window picker)
* More touch screen support, including touch-to-move and
  touch-to-activate for surfaces, touch screen drag-and-drop

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  from a vt after logging in or run from an init script with -u.
  setup and restore tty in weston-launch, handle vt switch and
  drop/set master in weston-launch.
* Support for RGB565 client buffers in gl and pixman renderers
* New WL_OUTPUT udev attribute for matching touch screen input
  devices to their outputs.
