  <title>Innovative 3D real-time strategy</title>
  <description>Warzone 2100 was an innovative 3D real-time strategy game back in 1999, and most will agree it didn't enjoy the commercial success it should have had. The game's source code was liberated on December 6th, 2004, under a GPL license (see COPYING  for details). Soon after that, the Warzone 2100 ReDev project was formed to take care of its future.
