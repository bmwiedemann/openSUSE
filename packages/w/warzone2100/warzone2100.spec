%description
You command the forces of "The Project" in a battle to rebuild
the world after mankind has almost been destroyed by nuclear
missiles.

The game offers campaign, multi-player and single-player skirmish
modes. An extensive tech tree with over 400 different
technologies, combined with the unit design system, allows for
a wide variety of possible units and tactics.

Warzone 2100 was originally developed as a commercial game by
Pumpkin Studios and published in 1999, and was released as
open source by them in 2004, for the community to continue
working on it.

This package provides the binaries for Warzone 2100.
