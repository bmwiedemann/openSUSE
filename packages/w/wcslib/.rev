    <comment>- Update to version 6.4 (2019/08/15):
  * Installation
    - The rule change to the Fortran makefile in v6.3 to add getwcstab_f.o
      to the sharable library causes it to depend on CFITSIO to resolve
      fits_get_wcstab().  Hence backed out of that change.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.16 (was 1.8.14).
- Update to version 6.3 (2019/07/12)
  * C library
    - Fixed the Polynomial and TPD distortions so that, as stipulated in
      WCS Paper IV, they are now considered to return an additive
      correction to be applied to the given coordinates, rather than the
      corrected coordinates themselves.
        Added a new subsection to the prologue of dis.h entitled 'Historical
      idiosyncrasies', which discusses this issue and other vagueries.
        Amended components of the test suite accordingly: SIPTPV.keyrec,
      TPV7.keyrec, and tdis1.c.
    - Fixed memory leaks and other potential problems that arose in the
      wcserr system consequent on changes made in release 6.1.
        Memory allocated by wcsfixi() for messages in the array of wcserr
      structs must now be freed by the caller.  Amended twcsfix.c
      accordingly.
    - Plugged memory leaks arising in disset().
    - New function wcsdealloc() provided to free memory allocated within
      certain WCSLIB routines.  Suggested by David Motl.
    - Eliminated a swag of inconsequential compiler warnings, particularly
      those emanating from the flex sources.
  * Validation
    - The library, Fortran wrappers, utilities, and test programs now pass
      runtime analysis using -fsanitize=address and -fsanitize=undefined
      in gcc 8.3.0, in addition to valgrind.  Also compile-time strictures
      using -std=c99, -pedantic, -Wall, -Wextra, and -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2.
      Prompted by feedback from Ole Streicher.
  * Installation
    - The non-graphical tests now run reliably in parallel builds
      (make CHECK=nopgplot -j8 check).  Requested by Mohammed Akhlaghi.
        The graphical tests can also be run in parallel, but as PGPLOT can
      only handle one stream at a time, some graphics are likely to be
      lost.  Nevertheless, it is a useful option, especially with runtime
      analysis via -fsanitize=address, etc.
    - As CFITSIO doesn't provide a Fortran wrapper for fits_read_wcstab(),
      getwcstab_f.o is now always included in the WCSLIB object library
      and sharable library if CFITSIO is available (and the WCSLIB Fortran
      wrappers are required).  Use 'configure --without-cfitsio' to
      defeat this.
    - Tidied up some aspects of the build where CFITSIO is not available.
  * User manual
    - Fixed minor formatting problems in dis.h.
