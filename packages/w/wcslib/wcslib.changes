Tue Sep  1 09:51:42 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.3.1:
  * There are no functional changes in this release.
  - Changed all C code, including within the flex sources, Fortran and
    PGSBOX wrappers, and test suite, to use C99 style commenting (i.e.
    using //), excluding the header prologues used to generate the user
    manual.
  - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.19 (was 1.8.18).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  6 14:09:00 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 7.3
  * C library
    - wcshdo() was writing MJD-OBS twice to the header, and
      MJD-BEG not at all.
    - In wcshdo(), if MJDREF assumes its default value, just write
      MJDREF = 0 (not MJDREFI & MJDREFF), and omit writing DATEREF,
      which, with a value of '1858-11-17', looks strange and is
      potentially confusing.  Reported by Thomas Robitaille.
      If the fractional part of MJDREF is zero, then just write the
      integer part as MJDREF (i.e. not as MJDREFI & MJDREFF).
    - Bug fix in wcsfix() - it was writing error messages that
      referred to DATE-REF and MJD-REF rather then DATEREF and
      MJDREF.  Reported by Mihai Cara.
    - Under control of a new flag, WCSHDR_DATEREF, added the option
      to wcspih() and wcsbth() to accept DATE-REF, MJD-REF,
      MJD-REFI, MJD-REFF, JDREF, JD-REFI, and JD-REFF as synonyms
      for the standard keywords, DATEREF, MJDREF, MJDREFI, MJDREFF,
      JDREF, JDREFI, and JDREFF.  The latter buck the pattern set
      by the other date keywords ({DATE,MJD}-{OBS,BEG,AVG,END}),
      thereby increasing the potential for confusion and error.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - As compilers are becoming much stricter (gfortran 10),
      modified all Fortran test programs to use the type-specific
      equivalents of the various *PUT and *GET routines.
      Reported by Ole Streicher.
    - For the fitshdr wrappers, added type-specific equivalents
      of KEYGET: KEYGTI, KEYGTD, and KEYGTC.
  * PGSBOX
    - Modified pgtest to use the type-specific equivalents of
      WCSPUT.
  * User manual
    - In the section "WCSLIB Fortran wrappers", promoted use of
      the type-specific equivalents of the various *PUT and *GET
      routines.
    - In the section "FITS-WCS and related software", added ASCL
      and ADS codes, where they exist, for all software packages
      mentioned.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.18
      (was 1.8.17).
- Allow fortran argument mismatches in rank and type to pass the
  tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  2 17:22:51 UTC 2020 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.2:
  * C library
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug relating to handling coordinate
      lookup tables.  Reported by Mihai Cara with fix.
      Also increased the number of coordinate axes handled from
      10 to 32.
  * Installation
    - New configure option, --disable-shared, defeats generation
      of the sharable library.
  Version 7.1:
    Changes in the contents of the wcsprm struct necessitated
    incrementing the major version number from 6 to 7 (i.e. the
    ABI changed).
  * C library
    - In wcsset(), set wcsprm::mjdref[] to zero if neither it nor
      wcsprm::dateref are defined, as per the standard.  Reported
      by Thomas Robitaille.
      wcsset() now also checks that the number of coordinate axes
      does not exceed 32.
    - In tabs2x(), fixed an out-of-bounds array access produced
      by invalid world coordinates.  Reported by Mihai Cara and
      Michael Seifert.
      In tab.c, declare static three helper functions, tabedge(),
      tabrow(), and tabvox(), used by tabs2x().  Increased the
      number of coordinate axes handled by tabvox() from 16 to
      32.
    - Extended datfix() to handle MJDREF/DATEREF, overlooked in
      the changes in release 6.1.  Also fixed the handling of
      MJD < 0.
    - Support Solar keywords RSUN_REF, DSUN_OBS, CRLN_OBS,
      CRLT_OBS, HGLN_OBS, and HGLT_OBS by accomodating them
      within an auxiliary struct, auxprm, within the wcsprm
      struct.  Now filled by the header parsers, wcspih() and
      wcsbth() and handled routinely by wcsinit(), wcssub(),
      wcscompare(), wcsfree(), wcsprt(), wcsset(), and wcshdo().
      Requested by Stuart Mumford (SunPy) with input from Bill
      Thompson.
    - Bug fix in wcsprintf_set() for resetting the output
      disposition.
      Reported by Mihai Cara with patch.
    - In dis.{h,c}, the DOCORR record is now handled as a
      first-class value via disprm::docorr.  This required
      changing the struct.
    - In cel.c, spc.c, wcserr.c, wcsfix.c, wcshdr.c, and
      wcsutil.c, quelled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0
      generated by
      -Wmaybe-uninitialized and -Wstringop-truncation (via
      -Wall).
      Similarly for various programs in the test suite.
    - In various functions, quelled warnings from the Microsoft
      Visual C++ compiler, mostly relating to pointer arithmetic.
      Reported by Michael Seifert.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Handled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0 generated by
      -Wstringop-truncation (via -Wall).
    - Minor enhancements to character argument handling,
      including, in prjget_(), blank-filling the returned strings
      matching PRJ_CODE and PRJ_NAME, and likewise for SPC_TYPE
      and SPC_CODE in spcget_().
  * Utilities
    - In wcsgrid, handled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0
      generated by -Wstringop-truncation (via -Wall).
  * User manual
    - In the section on "FITS-WCS and related software", added
      mention of the R wrappers (Rwcs).  Suggested by Aaron
      Robotham.
    - Added a new section detailing the limit on the number of
      image axes that WCSLIB can handle (currently 32), and how
      this could be increased if needed.  Prompted by Thomas
      Robitaille.
    - Augmented the section on the Fortran wrappers, particularly
      with respect to character string handling in argument
      lists.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.17 (was
      1.8.16).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 10 14:53:23 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 6.4 (2019/08/15):
  * Installation
    - The rule change to the Fortran makefile in v6.3 to add getwcstab_f.o
      to the sharable library causes it to depend on CFITSIO to resolve
      fits_get_wcstab().  Hence backed out of that change.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.16 (was 1.8.14).
- Update to version 6.3 (2019/07/12)
  * C library
    - Fixed the Polynomial and TPD distortions so that, as stipulated in
      WCS Paper IV, they are now considered to return an additive
      correction to be applied to the given coordinates, rather than the
      corrected coordinates themselves.
        Added a new subsection to the prologue of dis.h entitled 'Historical
      idiosyncrasies', which discusses this issue and other vagueries.
        Amended components of the test suite accordingly: SIPTPV.keyrec,
      TPV7.keyrec, and tdis1.c.
    - Fixed memory leaks and other potential problems that arose in the
      wcserr system consequent on changes made in release 6.1.
        Memory allocated by wcsfixi() for messages in the array of wcserr
      structs must now be freed by the caller.  Amended twcsfix.c
      accordingly.
    - Plugged memory leaks arising in disset().
    - New function wcsdealloc() provided to free memory allocated within
      certain WCSLIB routines.  Suggested by David Motl.
    - Eliminated a swag of inconsequential compiler warnings, particularly
      those emanating from the flex sources.
  * Validation
    - The library, Fortran wrappers, utilities, and test programs now pass
      runtime analysis using -fsanitize=address and -fsanitize=undefined
      in gcc 8.3.0, in addition to valgrind.  Also compile-time strictures
      using -std=c99, -pedantic, -Wall, -Wextra, and -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2.
      Prompted by feedback from Ole Streicher.
  * Installation
    - The non-graphical tests now run reliably in parallel builds
      (make CHECK=nopgplot -j8 check).  Requested by Mohammed Akhlaghi.
        The graphical tests can also be run in parallel, but as PGPLOT can
      only handle one stream at a time, some graphics are likely to be
      lost.  Nevertheless, it is a useful option, especially with runtime
      analysis via -fsanitize=address, etc.
    - As CFITSIO doesn't provide a Fortran wrapper for fits_read_wcstab(),
      getwcstab_f.o is now always included in the WCSLIB object library
      and sharable library if CFITSIO is available (and the WCSLIB Fortran
      wrappers are required).  Use 'configure --without-cfitsio' to
      defeat this.
    - Tidied up some aspects of the build where CFITSIO is not available.
  * User manual
    - Fixed minor formatting problems in dis.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 21:10:11 UTC 2018 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 6.2:
  * C library
    - Consequent on the change in release 6.1, reapplied soothing
      balm to the wtbarr struct definition in wcs.h for C++
      compilation (C and Fortran compilation being unaffected).
      While the object libraries themselves are unchanged, the
      modified wcs.h must be installed for compiling C++
      applications.
  * User manual
    - Fixed minor formatting problems with the doxygen manual
      generation.
  From version 6.1:
  * C library
    - Added support for time-related WCS keywords (Paper VII) by
      expanding the wcsprm struct to store them as auxiliary
      values, now filled by the header parsers, wcspih() and
      wcsbth() and handled routinely by wcsinit(), wcssub(),
      wcscompare(), wcsfree(), wcsprt(), wcsset(), and wcshdo().
    - Augmented datfix() to do various consistency checks on the
      new time-related keyvalues, and added a new routine,
      obsfix(), to check consistency of the OBSGEO-[XYZLBH]
      observatory coordinates.
    - In the usage notes for wcsbth(), clarified that, according to
      WCS Papers III and VII, certain global image header keywords
      are permitted in binary table headers and are expected to be
      inherited by image arrays and pixel lists, and elaborated on
      the difficulties that such inheritance may cause for pixel
      lists.
    - Revamped message string handling in the wcserr module to
      allow arbitrarily long messages while greatly reducing the
      sizeof the struct.
    - Extracted the definition of the wtbarr struct from wcs.h to a
      separate header file, wtbarr.h, in order to reduce the number
      of irrelevant warnings generated by 'gcc -Wpadded' (primarily
      for code development).  Applications code that needs to
      access members of the struct (unlikely) must now include
      wtbarr.h (or wcslib.h).
    - The WCSLIB major version number was incremented as changes to
      the wcsprm struct makes the ABI of the sharable library
      incompatible with executables linked with that of older
      releases.
  * Installation
    - Several changes to configure and the makefiles aimed at
      facilitating code development.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Match changes to the C library, including adding a wrapper
      for obsfix().
  From version 5.20:
  * C library
    - Added utility functions dpkeyi() and dpkeyd() to dis.c, and
      removed the corresponding functions from wcsutil.c.
  * Installation
    - Reworked the makefiles to allow parallel library builds, as
      required by some software distributions. (Parallel execution
      of the test suite is not supported.)
    - The introduction of "deterministic" archiving (ar(1)) broke
      dependency analysis in the WCSLIB makefiles on the many
      systems where it is now enabled by default (i.e. binutils
      configured with --enable-deterministic-archives).
      Modified configure to force non-deterministic archiving
      during the library builds, thus repairing the dependency
      analysis.  However, the static object libraries are now
      reconstructed using deterministic archiving in the process of
      installing them.
    - Fixed problems with the dependency analysis, solely affecting
      code development.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - New wrappers for dpkeyi() and dpkeyd().
  From version 5.19.1:
  * Installation
    - Updated ./config/config.{guess,sub} to the latest versions
      from the GIT repository, timestamped 2018-07-18 and
      2018-07-25, respectively. The previous pair were dated
      2012-02-10 and 2012-04-18.
  From version 5.19:
  * C library
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug in handling distortion functions on
      axes with changed axis number in the subimage (i.e. via
      deletion or addition of an axis).
    - In various routines within dis.c, wcs.c, wcshdr.c, and
      wcspih.l, increased the size of various sprintf() output
      buffers to avert -Wformat-overflow warnings from gcc 8.1.0
      (with -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2).
      Also fixed other warnings in these routines from gcc 8.1.0
      relating to -Wcast-function-type, -Wmaybe-uninitialized, and
      -Wunused-parameter.
    - In wcsutrn.l (the units alias translator used by wcsfix),
      recognise 'Deg', 'Degree', and 'Degrees' as aliases for
      'deg'.
    - Added a note to the prologue of spx.h explaining WCSLIB's use
      of Cox's air-to-vacuum transformation equation rather than
      the IUGG relation cited in WCS Paper III.
    - In the test suite, avert nuisance compiler warnings in tdis1.
      Made tsphdpa more robust in handling user coordinate input.
  * PGSBOX
    - In pgwcsl_(), avert nuisance warnings from gcc 8.1.0 relating
      to unused parameters (-Wunused-parameter).  Also averted
      nuisance compiler warnings in cpgtest.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware was not reading the -TAB table from the FITS file for
      alternate descriptions. Nor was wcsfix() ever invoked for
      them.
      Made it more robust in handling user input of coordinates for
      the -x and -w options.
    - Fixed compiler warnings from gcc 8.1.0 in HPXcvt
      (-Wmaybe-uninitialized), and wcsgrid (-Wformat-overflow).
  * Installation
    - Amended configure.ac to allow cross-compilation, and also
      updated the auxiliary configure scripts in the config/
      directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  9 22:36:05 UTC 2018 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.18:
  * C library
    - New routines introduced to preclude altering the global
      variables NPVMAX, NPSMAX, and NDPMAX, which determine how
      much memory to allocate for storing PVi_ma, PSi_ma, DPja, and
      DQia keyvalues: wcsinit(), lininit(), lindist(), and
      disinit().  These are now used by various WCSLIB routines,
      such as the header parsers, which previously temporarily
      altered the global variables, thus posing a thread hazard.
    - The Flex scanners, fitshdr(), wcsbth(), wcspih(), wcsulexe(),
      and wcsutrne(), have been rewritten as thin wrappers (with
      the same API) over scanners that were modified (with changed
      API) as required to use Flex's "reentrant" option.
      Consequently, they are now reentrant and should be
      thread-safe.  That also passes through to the deprecated
      wrappers, wcsulex() and wcsutrn().
    - Fixed memory leaks in lindist() and lincpy() uncovered by
      valgrind.
    - Test programs tfitshdr, tpih1, tpih2, and ttab3 are now
      careful to free all allocated memory before exit to defeat
      spurious reports of memory leaks by valgrind.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - New wrappers for wcsinit(), lininit(), lindist(), and
      disinit().
  * User manual
    - Updates and amendments in line with the above changes.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.14
      (was 1.8.13).
  From version 5.17:
  * C library
    - Fixed a memory leak in wcspih().
    - Fixed compiler warnings about comparison between signed and
      unsigned integers in tab.c. Also fixed warnings in other
      functions about unused parameters.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Fixed compiler warnings about comparison between signed and
      unsigned integers in several routines.
  * PGSBOX
    - Fixed a compiler warning about comparison between signed and
      unsigned ints.
  * Installation
    - Removed setgid permission on installation directories.
  * User manual
    - Minor updates and amendments.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.13 (was
      1.8.10).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  5 18:57:04 UTC 2017 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.16:
  * C library
    - Bug fix in spcfix() for the previous change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 17 17:04:51 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Rename the package from libwcs to wcslib. Added appropriate
  Provides/Obsoletes entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 14 15:09:24 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Avoid unnecessary double emittance of %optflags into compiler
  line. Fixup groups for openSUSE Factory acceptance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 13 20:24:58 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Removed static library.
- Removed requirement of libwcs lib from libwcs-doc (not needed).
- Added Recommends entry for libwcs-doc in libwcs-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 19:05:38 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.15:
  * C library
    - Bug fix in wcsulex.l for the previous change.  Reported, and
      fix supplied by Tammo Jan Dijkema.
    - In spcfix(), report the value of VELREF if ctype is
      translated from the AIPS convention.
  From version 5.14:
  * C library
    - In wcsulex.l and wcsutrn.l, applied a workaround for a memory
      leak introduced by a change (bug) in flex in Aug/2012.
      Reported, and fix supplied by Thomas Robitaille and Erik
      Bray.
  * Installation
    - In MacOSX, create symlink libwcs.dylib pointing to the
      dynamic library so that WCSLIB is linked dynamically by
      default. Requested by Paul Price.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 13:37:56 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.13
  * C library
    - In wcshdo(), provide floating-point format control via the 'ctrl'
      argument (formerly 'relax').
    - In wcspih(), PLATEID by itself is no longer sufficient to trigger a
      DSS translation (reported by James Allen).
    - In unitfix(), ensure that the message buffer cannot be overrun, e.g.
      by blank-padded unit strings (reported by Vishal Kasliwal).
- Update to version 5.12
  * C library
    - Bug fix in wcshdo() for CRVALia precision reported by Mihai Cara.
- Update to version 5.11
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih.l and dis.c for WAT distortions provided by
      Ole Streicher.
- Update to version 5.10
  * C library
    - In wcshdo(), allow output of floating point keyvalues to 15
      significant digits (was 14), mainly for astropy.
    - In wcspih(), allow unrecognised WAT projection types (tan, etc.) to
      pass without returning an error.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.
      Also fixed a bug triggered by SIP keywords in unconventional order,
      reported by Colin Slater, LSST.
- Update to version 5.9
  * C library
    - In disx2p(), make proper allowance for the possibility that the TPD
      and SIP forward and inverse distortion polynomials may not be of the
      same degree, reported by Martin Kuemmel.
    - Fix-ups in wcshdo() reported by Michael Droettboom, and several
      tidy-ups as well.
- Update to version 5.8
  * C library
    - DSS (Digitized Sky Survey) coordinates are now handled via TPD, as
      are the TNX and ZPX "projections".  New test script tdis3 and
      headers DSS.keyrec, TNX.keyrec, and ZPX.keyrec.
    - New function dishdo() can be used to set a flag that causes
      wcshdo() to write headers in the form of the distortion function
      used internally (usually TPD).
    - Added the capability, via DPja.DOCORR, for a distortion function to
      to compute an additive correction to the undistorted coordinates
      (rather than computing the distorted coordinates themselves).
    - Added auxiliary variables to TPD via DPja.AUX.jhat.COEFF.m.
    - Bug fix in wcshdo() for TPV, diagnosed by Michael Droettboom.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrapper for dishdo().
- Update to version 5.7
  * C library
    - Extended wcssub() to handle distortions (and thus wcscopy() also).
    This required axis mapping to be enabled for SIP distortions within
      WCSLIB.
    - wcshdo() now handles all distortions currently supported by WCSLIB:
      SIP, TPV, TPD, and Polynomial.
    - Bug fixes in sphx2s() and sphs2x() for non-unit vector strides for
      special-case rotations.
    - In wcsset(), modify wcsprm::ctype after translating TPV so that
      subsequent calls won't try to re-translate it, the PVi_ma records
      by then having been erased.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.  Also,
      restore NDPMAX after translating TPV.
    - Bug fixes in discpy(), disprt(), disset(), and disx2p().
    - Added disperr(), prjperr(), spcperr(), spxperr(), and tabperr() to
      complete the set and make reporting errors slightly more convenient.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware has a new option, -o, to print the wcsprm struct in the form
      of a FITS header using wcshdo().  Also, the -a option has been
      extended to allow a 0-relative numeric index for selecting an
      alternate WCS, where the alternates are sequenced alphabetically
      (without gaps) following the primary representation.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.10 (was 1.8.9.1).
- Update to version 5.6
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih() and sipset() to account for the fact that the
      independent variables of the SIP polynomial are pixel coordinate
      offsets from CRPIXja, not pixel coordinates per se.  Diagnosed by
      Michael Droettboom.
    - Validated SIP and TPV handling by comparing the output of
      'wcsware -x' with that of wcstools 'xy2sky -d -n6' using astropy's
      SIP test headers, and separate SIP and TPV headers originating from
      the Palomar Transient Factory provided by David Shupe.
    - Changed SIP.keyrec so that CRPIX1 and CRPIX2 differ in value,
      thereby making tests sensitive to any confusion between the two.
- Update to version 5.5
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih.l for headers with multiple distortions, and for
      distortion parameter look-alike keywords.
    - Bug fix in sipset() uncovered by valgrind.
- Update to version 5.4.1
  * C library
    - Added a fairly lengthy section to the prologue of dis.h describing
      the Paper IV keywords and the distortion functions currently
      implemented.
  * User manual
    - Added a new section on WCSLIB version numbers.
- Update to version 5.4
  * C library
    - Further work on distortions: wcspih() now parses Paper IV distortion
      keywords (CPDISja, CQDISia, DPja, DQia, etc.), thus handling record-
      valued keywords.  SIP keywords are also parsed and translated into
      Paper IV keywords.
    - TPV, SIP, and whereever possible, the general Polynomial distortion
      function of Paper IV are now implemented by the Template Polynomial
      Distortion (TPD), that being a superset of TPV and SIP.  TPD, which
      can also handle 1D distortions and be used for inversions, is also
      supported as a separate distortion type defined by Paper IV
      keywords.  TPD efficiently handles 1D distortions and distortions
      without radial terms.
    - Specialized inverse distortions, such as defined by SIP, are
      implemented by TPD and recognized by disx2p(), which uses them to
      compute the initial approximation of its more precise iterative
      solution.
    - Generalized tdis1.c so that it can do closure tests for SIP headers,
      and added a SIP test header.
- Update to version 5.3.1
  * C library
    - Bug fix in test program tdis1.c reported by Martin Kuemmel.
- Update to version 5.3
  * First public release of WCSLIB 5.x with distortions capability.
  * C library
    - Changed disprm::dtype from char[16] to char[72] for reasons relating
      to header parsing.
    - More armour plating for disset() and friends.  They also use new
      utility functions wcsutil_dpkey_int() and wcsutil_dpkey_double() to
      extract numeric values from a dpkey struct.  This ensures their
      independence of the data type, the appropriate reporting of dpkey
      values by disprt(), and (eventually) the appropriate writing of DPja
      and DQia keyvalues by wcshdo().
    - Augmented the usage comments for dpfill() to explain how numeric
      values in a dpkey struct are handled.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware now uses wcserr to provide a backtrace on errors.  Also
      fixed a couple of minor annoyances relating to alternate
      representations.
- Update to version 5.2 beta
  * C library
    - Further development of disprm and related functions to implement
      the FITS keywords for distortions introduced in WCS Paper IV, thus
      changing disprm's ABI once again.
      disprm's model is now similar to wcsprm's handling of PVi_ma and
      PSi_ma, where the parsed keyrecords are loaded into a set of pvcard
      and pscard structs and wcsset() does the analysis.  For disprm, the
      parsed DPja or DQia keyrecords are loaded into a set of dpkey
      structs for disset() to analyse.
    - New function dpfill() aids in filling a dpkey struct.  Function
      disparms() has been removed.  It was no longer needed as
      disprm::parms[][] is now a "returned" member of the struct.
    - Implementation of the general Polynomial distortion function defined
      in Sect. 3.1 of WCS Paper IV.  The polynomial is defined in terms of
      Paper IV keywords.
    - Bug fixes in diswarp() and linwarp() reported by
      Michael Droettboom.
    - Test program tdis1 now tests a TPV header for closure in two ways:
      directly as a specialist TPV distortion (as before), then by
      translating it into a general polynomial distortion.  It then also
      tests that the TPV and polynomial distortions produce the same
      results.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Changes to the wrappers reflecting changes to disprm.
    - Bug fixes in fitshdr_f.c, and test programs tdis1.f, tfitshdr.f,
      twcsfix.f, and twcs.f.  All reported and/or fixed by Ole Streicher.
- Update to version 5.1 beta
  * C library
    - Distortions-related bug fixes to linset(), linp2x(), and linx2p().
    - New functions diswarp() and linwarp() compute statistics of the
      distortion functions over a specified domain.  Changed tdis1.c to
      test them.
    - Changes to disprm (so changed ABI).
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrappers for diswarp() and linwarp().
- Update to version 5.0 beta
  * C library
    - Implemented the framework of WCS Paper IV (the draft distortions
      proposal) based on a new struct, disprm, and suite of routines with
      header dis.h: disini(), disalloc(), discpy(), disfree(), disprt(),
      disset(), disp2x(), and disx2p().  New test program tdis1.
      Consequent changes to the linprm struct have altered its ABI, thus
      necessitating an increment in the WCSLIB major verion number.
    - wcsset() now recognises the "TPV" projection proposed in an early
      draft of WCS Paper II, and translates it into a disprm distortion -
      by request of Octavi Fors.  Additionally, it recognises "TPU" as
      equivalent to "TPV" but using a prior distortion (coming before the
      linear transformation matrix) rather than sequent (coming after it).
    - In wcspih() and wcsbth(), added relaxation flags to allow PC0i_0ja,
      PV0j_0ma, and PS0j_0ma (i.e. with leading zeroes on the index).
    - Added wcslib_version() to return the WCSLIB version number, as
      suggested by Ole Streicher.
    - Fixed problems uncovered by valgrind in prjbchk() (reported by
      Ger van Diepen), sphx2s(), sphx2s(), spcspxe(), spcxpse(), tabini(),
      and wcshdo_util().
    - Tidied up error reporting, particularly relating to translating
      status returns from lower-level functions.  New functions linperr()
      and celperr() report error messages from the structs they contain
      in addition to their own.
    - Changed output formatting of floating point values in linprt(),
      celprt(), prjprt(), spcprt(), tabprt(), and wcsprt().  Updated the
      test output reference files for tbth1, tpih1, twcsfix, twcssub, and
      twcstab to suit.
    - Tidied up several of the test programs, mostly to free memory
      explicitly before exit so that valgrind doesn't report (non-)leaks.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrappers for the new distortion functions.  New test programs
      tdis1.f and tdis2.f.
    - Updates following changes to wcspih() and wcsbth().
    - Added wrappers for linperr() and celperr().  Also added prjperr_(),
      spcperr_(), and tabperr_() as convenient wrappers on wcserr_prt().
    - Wrapper for wcslib_version().
  * Utilities
    - Added a "lint" function to wcsware to check a FITS header for
      conformance to the WCS standard.  New test program twcslint.
  * PGSBOX
    - In PGCRLB, fixed an incorrect use of the MOD intrinsic reported by
      'gfortran -std=f95' via Jean-Baptiste Marquette.
- Remove upstream-included build_flags.patch

- Update to version 4.23 (2014/05/11)
  * C library
    - New function wcscompare() compares two wcsprm structs for equality
      with varying degrees of strictness.  Test program twcscompare.
      Contributed by Michael Droettboom.
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug uncovered by valgrind arising from
      allocation of insufficient memory for temporaries when a new axis
      is added.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.
    - In wcshdo(), don't write RESTFRQ or RESTWAV if zero.
      Also, to distinguish them from integer keyvalues, floating-
      point values will now always be written with an exponent or
      fractional part, ".0" being appended if necessary to achieve this.
      Suggested by Peter Weilbacher.
    - Fixed the '-h' option in twcshdr.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrapper for wcscompare().
- Update to version 4.22 (2014/04/13)
  * C library
    - In pcox2s() and pcos2x(), use alternative projection equations for
      greater numerical precision near theta == 0.  In cops2x(), return
      an exact result for theta at the poles.  Relaxed the tolerance for
      bounds checking a little in sflx2s().
    - Update to version 4.21 (2014/03/24)
  * C library
    - New function prjbchk() performs bounds checking on native spherical
      coordinates.  It is invoked automatically by the deprojection (x2s)
      routines if prjprm::bounds&4 is set.  Documented the new bounds
      checking implemented by prjbchk() in the prologue entry for
      wcsbchk().  Improvements to tprj1 to test the vector API of prjx2s()
      and to deal better with out-of-bounds native coordinates returned by
      it.
    - Bug fixes in the projection routines: in hpxx2s() relating to bounds
      checking, bug introduced at 4.20, reported by Michael Droettboom; in
      parx2s() and molx2s() relating to setting the stat vector; in
      hpxx2s() relating to implementation of the vector API; and in
        xphx2s() relating to setting an out-of-bounds value of phi.
