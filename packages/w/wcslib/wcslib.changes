- Update to 8.5
  ## C library
  * In linp2x(), quarantine NaN elements of the pixel coordinate
    vector from infecting non-NaN elements in the case where the
    PCij matrix is diagonal (noting that zero * NaN = NaN).
    Likewise in linx2p(). Reported by Thomas Robitaille with patch.
  * Quelled nuisance compiler warnings in wcspih() and wcsbth().
- WCSLIB version 8.4
  ## C library
  * Fixed some problems in wcs_chksum() and changed
    wcs_fletcher32() to conform to the standard computation.
  * New test program, twcs_pthread.
- WCSLIB version 8.3
  ## C library
  * Until now, wcsset() always operated unconditionally - the
    wcsprm struct was set or reset regardless of its current state.
    Likewise the various *set() functions for the other structs.
    However, in some situations, particularly in threaded
    applications, it is desirable to have wcsset(), etc., check the
    state of the struct and return immediately if it has already
    been set.  This may now be accomplished by setting wcsprm::flag
    == 1 (instead of 0) before calling wcsset().  Likewise for the
    other structs.  This sets a "bypass" flag within the struct
    itself.
  * A new function, wcsenq(), queries the state of the wcsprm
    struct, specifically whether WCSLIB is managing its memory,
    whether the struct has been set, whether or not it is in bypass
    mode, and whether it is self-consistent.  There are
    corresponding functions for the other structs: celenq(),
    disenq(), linenq(), prjenq(), spcenq(), and tabenq().  Please
    refer to the WCSLIB manual.
  * In the C test suite, modified twcs to test wcsenq() and also
    wcsset() in bypass mode.
  * Quelled nuisance compiler warnings in wcsbth(), wcspih(),
    wcsp2s(), and wcshdo().
  ## Fortran wrappers
  * Interprocedural Link Time Optimization (LTO), when used with
    the strict compiler options required by some Linux
    distributions, may place more stringent requirements on mixing
    code written in different languages.  Specifically, as far as
    WCSLIB is concerned, this applies for Fortran calling C (or
    vice versa) where the function parameter list includes a
    character variable.
    It is important to note that the existing Fortran wrappers work
    as they did before, with or without LTO, that issues only arise
    when strict LTO compiler options are enabled, and that wrappers
    without a character argument are unaffected.
    Fortran 2003 introduced the "language-binding-spec" attribute
    using the keyword BIND.  The INTERFACE block for a procedure
    may be given the BIND(C) attribute to specify the interface of
    an external, interoperable C function.  Use of this BIND(C)
    attribute is now virtually mandated by LTO (with said strict
    compiler options).
    The WCSLIB Fortran wrappers are written in C, e.g. wcs_f.c,
    with a Fortran-compliant interface, and these C functions are
    intended to be called directly from Fortran applications.
    Three options were considered for achieving strict LTO
    compliance:
      1) Require that all existing Fortran applications be modified
         to conform to the Fortran 2003 language binding
         specification via the addition of INTERFACE blocks bearing
         the BIND(C) attribute for the existing wrappers.
         This option is clearly untenable.
      2) Rewrite the WCSLIB Fortran wrappers completely in Fortran
         2003.
         It seems that this option may be tenable as the BIND(C)
         spec allows for C-equivalent derived types.  However, it
         would require rewriting all of the wrappers, 5 kloc of C
         code, in Fortran 2003 code that must directly manipulate
         the internals of all of the WCSLIB structs.
      3) Introduce a new layer of thin wrappers, written in Fortran
         2003, that do nothing more than define the INTERFACE to
         the existing wrappers written in C and then call them.
         Essentially this extracts the changes required in option
         (1) into a new set of wrappers.
         This was the option chosen on the basis of simplicity -
         only specific wrappers, namely those with character
         arguments, need be rewrapped.  It also minimises WCSLIB's
         exposure to Fortran 2003, particularly for the sake of
         legacy astronomical packages such as Miriad and AIPS.
         Further, it admits the possibility of the optional use of
         this extra layer of wrappers.
    The new Fortran 2003 wrappers reside in the Fortran
    subdirectory in files by the name of *_bindc.f90.  By default
    they are not compiled and not used.  To use them, WCSLIB must
    be configure'd with the new '--with-bindc' option.  This causes
    the new BIND(C) wrappers to be compiled, and the names of the
    old wrappers to be changed, for example from wcspih_() to
    wcspih_c().
    LTO compile problems reported by Eli Schwartz, Gentoo
    maintainer.
  * Added wrappers for celenq(), disenq(), linenq(), prjenq(),
    spcenq(), tabenq(), and wcsenq().
  * In the Fortran test suite, modified twcs to test WCSENQ and
    also WCSSET in bypass mode.
  ## PGSBOX
  - Changes mirroring those described above for the Fortran
    wrappers, the difference being that here we have a mix of C
    calling Fortran (e.g. cpgsbox() calling PGSBOX) as well as
    Fortran calling C (e.g. PGWCSL calling pgwcsl_c()).  As with
    the Fortran wrappers, the new configure option, '--with-bindc',
    chooses whether to use the new BIND(C) PGSBOX wrappers.
  ## Installation
  * Added '--with-bindc' as a new configure option (or BINDC=yes
    from the environment) to signal the use of the new strictly
    LTO-compliant Fortran wrappers.  See above.
  *  Modified 'configure' to report the version of gcc used.
    Likewise, for the 'show' rule in makedefs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  9 18:22:49 UTC 2023 - Ben Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to 8.2.2
  * In prj.c, a number of variables with global scope that are only
    used internally were declared static to avoid namespace
    conflicts arising in Link Time Optimization (LTO) builds of the
    Rwcs wrappers.  This is a patch release as it does not affect
    the library itself other than in localising some symbols that
    were never meant to be global. Reported by Rodrigo Carrizo with
    patch.

    Likewise for an internally used helper function, prjoff().
    Likewise for a handful of variables in cel.c, dis.c, lin.c,
    tab.c, wcs.c, wcsfix.c, and wcshdr.c.
- WCSLIB version 8.2
  * In wcshdo(), fixed character buffer overflows in the comment
    string for the longitude and latitude axes triggered by some
    projections, and also the formatting for generic coordinate
    systems.  Reported by Shu Niu.
- WCSLIB version 8.1
  * Changes in the contents of the auxprm struct (in 8.0 beta)
    necessitated incrementing the major version number from 7 to 8,
    i.e. the ABI changed. Took the opportunity for minor tweaks to
    wcsprm and disprm.
  ## C library
  * In disprm, changed the order of maxdis and totdis to ensure
      correct alignment of doubles on 32-bit machines.
  ## Fortran wrappers
  * Match changes to disprm in the C library.
  * In the Fortran test suite, inserted a brief pause between plots
    in tprj2, tspc, and tpih2, which have long been a blur.
  ## PGSBOX
  * Quell innocuous compiler warnings from gfortran 12.1.0.
    Inserted a brief pause between plots in pgtest and cpgtest.
- WCSLIB version 8.0 beta
  * Beta test version, not publically released.
  ## C library
  * Support planetary keywords A_RADIUS, B_RADIUS, C_RADIUS, BLON_OBS,
    BLAT_OBS, and BDIS_OBS in auxprm by analogy with the Solar keywords
    added at 7.1.  Requested by Chiara Marmo (Observatoire de Paris).
  * Added wcsprm::time to the wcsprm struct to record the TIME axis
    number (along with lng, lat, and spec).
  * Fixed a bug in wcspih() and wcsbth() where trailing blanks were not
    stripped from string keyvalues.  Reported by Naveen Dukiya.
    Changed test program tdis3 to test this.
  * Fixed a problem affecting thread safety in disp2x(), disx2p(), and
    diswarp().  Reported by Mohammad Akhlaghi.
  ## Fortran wrappers
  * Match changes to the C library supporting planetary keywords in
    auxprm and the addition of wcsprm::time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 11 19:28:48 UTC 2022 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.12:
  * C library
    - In wcsp2s() and wcss2p(), fixed handling of status returns
      from linp2x() and linx2p() relating to distortion functions,
      specifically with respect to setting the stat[] vector.
      Reported by Sepideh Eskandarlou (via Mohammad Akhlaghi).
    - When extracting by axis type, wcssub() did not account for
      the possibility of time axes with -TAB or -LOG algorithm
      codes. Reported by Mihai Cara.
  * Utilities
    - Fixed a bit of confusion in wcsgrid relating to cfitsio file
      opening syntax, e.g. file.fits+1.  It now matches wcsware in
      that regard.
    - Portability fix - need to define _POSIX_C_SOURCE as 199506L
      in order to get the declaration of localtime_r().  Reported
      by Marc Espie.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.9.5 (was 1.9.3).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  5 20:07:33 UTC 2022 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.11:
  * C library
    - In tabini(), the default index array should contain a
      1-relative sequence: {1, 2,... N}.  Previously it was
      0-relative.
  From version 7.10:
  * C library
    - In tabcpy(), collapse degenerate table index arrays if they
      are collapsed in the source struct.  Minor fix for output
      formatting in tabprt().
    - In the C test suite, added calls to wcstrim() in twcsfix to
      tidy the structs before printing.
  * Utilities
    - The default option in wcsware now trims the wcsprm struct
      before printing it.  Use the '-p' option to print the
      untrimmed struct.
  From version 7.9:
  * C library
    - In wcsset(), bug fix for identifying time coordinate axes.
      Reported by Mihai Cara with patch.
  From version 7.8:
  * C library
    - In wcssub(), bug fix for tabular coordinates that change axis
      number, thus requiring tabprm::map to be updated.  Reported
      by Mihai Cara with patch.
      Also in wcssub():
      - check that all axes of a multi-dimensional table are
        extracted together,
      - fixed potential memory leaks for tabular coordinate axes
        when an attempt to subimage non-separable axes fails,
      - the error messages for non-separable coordinate systems are
        generally more informative,
      - subimage extraction by coordinate type now recognises time
        coordinate axis types via WCSSUB_TIME.
    - wcsset() now identifies time coordinate axes in
      wcsprm::types.
    - Extended test program twcssub to test the above
      modifications.
  * Installation
    - Bug fix in the utils makefile for creating $(MANDIR)/man1.
      Reported by Aleksander Kurek.
    - Bug fix in the Fortran makefile for compiling and using
      'tofits'. Reported by Stefan Br�ns.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.9.3 (was 1.9.1).
- Removed 0001-Fix-utils-tofits-location-in-Fortran-GNUmakefile.patch
  (fixed upstream).
- Don't use %configure macro for building i586 package (it makes
  tests fail).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 10 21:35:28 UTC 2021 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 7.7, for details see:
  https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/CHANGES
- Remove workarounds for gfortran 10/11
- Add 0001-Fix-utils-tofits-location-in-Fortran-GNUmakefile.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 16 20:11:48 UTC 2021 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.6:
  * C library
    - Bug fix in tabs2x() triggered for 1-dimensional coordinate
      lookup tables on axes > 1.  Reported by Mihai Cara.
    - In datfix(), don't return status 0 if no change was made (fix
      for change made at release 7.4).  Reported by Derek Homeier.
    - New function wcspcx() in the wcsfix suite regularizes the
      linear transformation component of a coordinate description
      to make it more human-readable.  It decomposes CDi_ja into
      PCi_ja and CDELTia in such a way that CDELTia forms
      meaningful scaling parameters, often leaving an orthogonal or
      near-orthogonal matrix.  Optionally, it can then permute rows
      of this matrix to unscramble axis permutations.
      A test header may be generated from wcspcx.keyrec for input
      to wcsware (not exercised as part of the standard test
      suite).
    - New function wcstrim() frees memory allocated by wcsinit()
      for arrays in a wcsprm struct that remain unused after the
      struct has been set up.
    - New functions wcssize(), auxsize(), tabsize(), linsize(),
      dissize(), celsize(), prjsize(), spcsize(), and wcserr_size()
      compute the total size of the relevant structs, including
      allocated memory.
    - In the C test suite, inserted a brief pause in tprj2 and
      tspc, which otherwise have now become a blur.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Added wrappers for wcspcx(), wcstrim(), wcssize(), auxsize(),
      tabsize(), linsize(), dissize(), celsize(), prjsize(),
      spcsize(), and wcserr_size().
  * Utilities
    - Added -c, -cp, -C, and -Cp options to wcsware to apply
      wcspcx() in a variety of ways, -m to apply wcstrim(), and -z
      to report the total size of the wcsprm struct with a
      breakdown of the sizes of its constituent structs.
    - Fixed compiler warnings for sundazel (portability issue).
  * Installation
    - Upped the required version of Flex to 2.6.0 (was 2.5.9).
      Problems with Flex 2.5.39 reported by Derek Homeier.
      Also added '--disable-flex' as a new configure option to
      force the use of the pre-generated Flex sources.
  From version 7.5:
  * The C code in WCSLIB is moving piecemeal to the C99 standard.
    In fact, various indispensible C99 constructs have been used in
    WCSLIB for many years: the long long int data type (in
    fitshdr() only); stdint.h, inttypes.h, and the use of PRI
    formatting control (in wcsprintf(), which is widely used by the
    library); and the C99-extended library function vsnprintf()
    (used by wcserr for a decade).  Flex-generated C code also uses
    C99 extensions, though with workarounds if they are not
    available.
    Except in the header prologues, which are formatted in a special
    way for generating the user manual, comments were changed en
    masse to C99 style in release 7.3.1, and variable declarations
    in code that I have occasion to modify will transition to the
    more general placement allowed by C99. However, there are no
    plans to use any of the more esoteric features of C99.
  * C library
    - New function, wcsccs(), changes the celestial coordinate
      system of a wcsprm struct, for example, from equatorial to
      galactic coordinates. The parameters that define the
      spherical coordinate transformation must be provided.  This
      allows WCSLIB to provide this functionality without needing
      to know anything about specific celestial coordinate systems,
      and has the advantage of making the routine completely
      general.  Requested by Mohammad Akhlaghi.
      Modified test program twcsfix also to test wcsccs().
    - Fixed a problem common to all of the Flex code (fitshdr,
      wcsbth, wcspih, wcsulex, and wcsutrn) that made it
      thread-unsafe.  Reported by Cyril Richard.
      Added a new test program, tpthreads, to test thread safety.
      It is only used for code development, and not exercised as
      part of the  standard test suite.
    - In fitshdr(), fixed a problem that potentially could arise on
      systems where sizeof(long long int) is greater than 8 (64
      bits).
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Match changes to the C library: added a wrapper for wcsccs(),
      and modified twcsfix.f.
    - Because null addresses cannot be passed to functions in
      Fortran, wcssub_() now interprets *nsub == -1 && *axes == -1
      as a signal to do a deep copy of one wcsprm struct to
      another.
  * Utilities
    - New utility, sundazel, computes the local time of the Sun's
      passage through the specified apparent longitude or latitude
      in a user-defined coordinate system.  It can also perform
      several other Solar related calculations.  (It is unrelated
      to FITS WCS, and does not use WCSLIB.)
  * Installation
    - Added an 'uninstall' rule to the makefiles.  Suggested by
      Cyril Richard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  1 21:17:40 UTC 2021 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.4:
  * C library
    - In wcshdo(), fixed a bug introduced in release 5.9 that
      potentially caused loss of numerical precision in the
      sprintf() formatting of floating point keyvalues. This was
      triggered when a large range of CRPIXja, PCi_ja, or CDELTia
      values (as three separate groups) were formatted using an 'f''
      format descriptor, the range not being so large that it would
      have forced wcshdo() to revert to 'E' format. Reported by
      Mohammad Akhlaghi.
      Also in wcshdo(), fixed a bug introduced in release 7.1 that
      caused the coefficients of the TPD distortion function not to
      be written to the header. TPD and Polynomial distortion
      function headers will now always include the DPja.DOCORR
      keyword. Reported by Derek Homeier with patch.
    - In wcsset(), fixed a segv generated in attempting to report a
      non-standard units string with wcserr message reporting
      disabled. Reported by Mohammad Akhlaghi.
      In wcsutrne(), allow 'Angstroms' and 'angstroms' as
      additional synonyms for 'Angstrom'.
    - In datfix(), ensure that 0 is returned if an informational
      message is set in wcsprm::err. Consequent on feedback
      independently from Mihai Cara and Bruce Merry.
      Clarified that informational messages may be set in
      wcsprm::err for returns of 0 from datfix(), obsfix(),
      unitfix(), and spcfix().
  * User manual
    - Added cautions about translating CDi_ja to PCi_ja plus
      CDELTia for those historical distortion functions (TPV, TNX,
      ZPX) that expect to operate on intermediate world
      coordinates, rather than intermediate pixel coordinates. 
      Consequent on feedback from Mohammad Akhlaghi.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.9.1 (was 1.8.19).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  1 09:51:42 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 7.3.1:
  * There are no functional changes in this release.
  - Changed all C code, including within the flex sources, Fortran and
    PGSBOX wrappers, and test suite, to use C99 style commenting (i.e.
    using //), excluding the header prologues used to generate the user
    manual.
  - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.19 (was 1.8.18).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul  6 14:09:00 UTC 2020 - Benjamin Greiner <code@bnavigator.de>

- Update to version 7.3
  * C library
    - wcshdo() was writing MJD-OBS twice to the header, and
      MJD-BEG not at all.
    - In wcshdo(), if MJDREF assumes its default value, just write
      MJDREF = 0 (not MJDREFI & MJDREFF), and omit writing DATEREF,
      which, with a value of '1858-11-17', looks strange and is
      potentially confusing.  Reported by Thomas Robitaille.
      If the fractional part of MJDREF is zero, then just write the
      integer part as MJDREF (i.e. not as MJDREFI & MJDREFF).
    - Bug fix in wcsfix() - it was writing error messages that
      referred to DATE-REF and MJD-REF rather then DATEREF and
      MJDREF.  Reported by Mihai Cara.
    - Under control of a new flag, WCSHDR_DATEREF, added the option
      to wcspih() and wcsbth() to accept DATE-REF, MJD-REF,
      MJD-REFI, MJD-REFF, JDREF, JD-REFI, and JD-REFF as synonyms
      for the standard keywords, DATEREF, MJDREF, MJDREFI, MJDREFF,
      JDREF, JDREFI, and JDREFF.  The latter buck the pattern set
      by the other date keywords ({DATE,MJD}-{OBS,BEG,AVG,END}),
      thereby increasing the potential for confusion and error.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - As compilers are becoming much stricter (gfortran 10),
      modified all Fortran test programs to use the type-specific
      equivalents of the various *PUT and *GET routines.
      Reported by Ole Streicher.
    - For the fitshdr wrappers, added type-specific equivalents
      of KEYGET: KEYGTI, KEYGTD, and KEYGTC.
  * PGSBOX
    - Modified pgtest to use the type-specific equivalents of
      WCSPUT.
  * User manual
    - In the section "WCSLIB Fortran wrappers", promoted use of
      the type-specific equivalents of the various *PUT and *GET
      routines.
    - In the section "FITS-WCS and related software", added ASCL
      and ADS codes, where they exist, for all software packages
      mentioned.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.18
      (was 1.8.17).
- Allow fortran argument mismatches in rank and type to pass the
  tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  2 17:22:51 UTC 2020 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 7.2:
  * C library
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug relating to handling coordinate
      lookup tables.  Reported by Mihai Cara with fix.
      Also increased the number of coordinate axes handled from
      10 to 32.
  * Installation
    - New configure option, --disable-shared, defeats generation
      of the sharable library.
  Version 7.1:
    Changes in the contents of the wcsprm struct necessitated
    incrementing the major version number from 6 to 7 (i.e. the
    ABI changed).
  * C library
    - In wcsset(), set wcsprm::mjdref[] to zero if neither it nor
      wcsprm::dateref are defined, as per the standard.  Reported
      by Thomas Robitaille.
      wcsset() now also checks that the number of coordinate axes
      does not exceed 32.
    - In tabs2x(), fixed an out-of-bounds array access produced
      by invalid world coordinates.  Reported by Mihai Cara and
      Michael Seifert.
      In tab.c, declare static three helper functions, tabedge(),
      tabrow(), and tabvox(), used by tabs2x().  Increased the
      number of coordinate axes handled by tabvox() from 16 to
      32.
    - Extended datfix() to handle MJDREF/DATEREF, overlooked in
      the changes in release 6.1.  Also fixed the handling of
      MJD < 0.
    - Support Solar keywords RSUN_REF, DSUN_OBS, CRLN_OBS,
      CRLT_OBS, HGLN_OBS, and HGLT_OBS by accomodating them
      within an auxiliary struct, auxprm, within the wcsprm
      struct.  Now filled by the header parsers, wcspih() and
      wcsbth() and handled routinely by wcsinit(), wcssub(),
      wcscompare(), wcsfree(), wcsprt(), wcsset(), and wcshdo().
      Requested by Stuart Mumford (SunPy) with input from Bill
      Thompson.
    - Bug fix in wcsprintf_set() for resetting the output
      disposition.
      Reported by Mihai Cara with patch.
    - In dis.{h,c}, the DOCORR record is now handled as a
      first-class value via disprm::docorr.  This required
      changing the struct.
    - In cel.c, spc.c, wcserr.c, wcsfix.c, wcshdr.c, and
      wcsutil.c, quelled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0
      generated by
      -Wmaybe-uninitialized and -Wstringop-truncation (via
      -Wall).
      Similarly for various programs in the test suite.
    - In various functions, quelled warnings from the Microsoft
      Visual C++ compiler, mostly relating to pointer arithmetic.
      Reported by Michael Seifert.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Handled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0 generated by
      -Wstringop-truncation (via -Wall).
    - Minor enhancements to character argument handling,
      including, in prjget_(), blank-filling the returned strings
      matching PRJ_CODE and PRJ_NAME, and likewise for SPC_TYPE
      and SPC_CODE in spcget_().
  * Utilities
    - In wcsgrid, handled compiler warnings from gcc 9.2.0
      generated by -Wstringop-truncation (via -Wall).
  * User manual
    - In the section on "FITS-WCS and related software", added
      mention of the R wrappers (Rwcs).  Suggested by Aaron
      Robotham.
    - Added a new section detailing the limit on the number of
      image axes that WCSLIB can handle (currently 32), and how
      this could be increased if needed.  Prompted by Thomas
      Robitaille.
    - Augmented the section on the Fortran wrappers, particularly
      with respect to character string handling in argument
      lists.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.17 (was
      1.8.16).

Sun Nov 10 14:53:23 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 6.4 (2019/08/15):
  * Installation
    - The rule change to the Fortran makefile in v6.3 to add getwcstab_f.o
      to the sharable library causes it to depend on CFITSIO to resolve
      fits_get_wcstab().  Hence backed out of that change.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.16 (was 1.8.14).
- Update to version 6.3 (2019/07/12)
  * C library
    - Fixed the Polynomial and TPD distortions so that, as stipulated in
      WCS Paper IV, they are now considered to return an additive
      correction to be applied to the given coordinates, rather than the
      corrected coordinates themselves.
        Added a new subsection to the prologue of dis.h entitled 'Historical
      idiosyncrasies', which discusses this issue and other vagueries.
        Amended components of the test suite accordingly: SIPTPV.keyrec,
      TPV7.keyrec, and tdis1.c.
    - Fixed memory leaks and other potential problems that arose in the
      wcserr system consequent on changes made in release 6.1.
        Memory allocated by wcsfixi() for messages in the array of wcserr
      structs must now be freed by the caller.  Amended twcsfix.c
      accordingly.
    - Plugged memory leaks arising in disset().
    - New function wcsdealloc() provided to free memory allocated within
      certain WCSLIB routines.  Suggested by David Motl.
    - Eliminated a swag of inconsequential compiler warnings, particularly
      those emanating from the flex sources.
  * Validation
    - The library, Fortran wrappers, utilities, and test programs now pass
      runtime analysis using -fsanitize=address and -fsanitize=undefined
      in gcc 8.3.0, in addition to valgrind.  Also compile-time strictures
      using -std=c99, -pedantic, -Wall, -Wextra, and -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2.
      Prompted by feedback from Ole Streicher.
  * Installation
    - The non-graphical tests now run reliably in parallel builds
      (make CHECK=nopgplot -j8 check).  Requested by Mohammed Akhlaghi.
        The graphical tests can also be run in parallel, but as PGPLOT can
      only handle one stream at a time, some graphics are likely to be
      lost.  Nevertheless, it is a useful option, especially with runtime
      analysis via -fsanitize=address, etc.
    - As CFITSIO doesn't provide a Fortran wrapper for fits_read_wcstab(),
      getwcstab_f.o is now always included in the WCSLIB object library
      and sharable library if CFITSIO is available (and the WCSLIB Fortran
      wrappers are required).  Use 'configure --without-cfitsio' to
      defeat this.
    - Tidied up some aspects of the build where CFITSIO is not available.
  * User manual
    - Fixed minor formatting problems in dis.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec  3 21:10:11 UTC 2018 - Asterios Dramis <asterios.dramis@gmail.com>

- Update to version 6.2:
  * C library
    - Consequent on the change in release 6.1, reapplied soothing
      balm to the wtbarr struct definition in wcs.h for C++
      compilation (C and Fortran compilation being unaffected).
      While the object libraries themselves are unchanged, the
      modified wcs.h must be installed for compiling C++
      applications.
  * User manual
    - Fixed minor formatting problems with the doxygen manual
      generation.
  From version 6.1:
  * C library
    - Added support for time-related WCS keywords (Paper VII) by
      expanding the wcsprm struct to store them as auxiliary
      values, now filled by the header parsers, wcspih() and
      wcsbth() and handled routinely by wcsinit(), wcssub(),
      wcscompare(), wcsfree(), wcsprt(), wcsset(), and wcshdo().
    - Augmented datfix() to do various consistency checks on the
      new time-related keyvalues, and added a new routine,
      obsfix(), to check consistency of the OBSGEO-[XYZLBH]
      observatory coordinates.
    - In the usage notes for wcsbth(), clarified that, according to
      WCS Papers III and VII, certain global image header keywords
      are permitted in binary table headers and are expected to be
      inherited by image arrays and pixel lists, and elaborated on
      the difficulties that such inheritance may cause for pixel
      lists.
    - Revamped message string handling in the wcserr module to
      allow arbitrarily long messages while greatly reducing the
      sizeof the struct.
    - Extracted the definition of the wtbarr struct from wcs.h to a
      separate header file, wtbarr.h, in order to reduce the number
      of irrelevant warnings generated by 'gcc -Wpadded' (primarily
      for code development).  Applications code that needs to
      access members of the struct (unlikely) must now include
      wtbarr.h (or wcslib.h).
    - The WCSLIB major version number was incremented as changes to
      the wcsprm struct makes the ABI of the sharable library
      incompatible with executables linked with that of older
      releases.
  * Installation
    - Several changes to configure and the makefiles aimed at
      facilitating code development.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Match changes to the C library, including adding a wrapper
      for obsfix().
  From version 5.20:
  * C library
    - Added utility functions dpkeyi() and dpkeyd() to dis.c, and
      removed the corresponding functions from wcsutil.c.
  * Installation
    - Reworked the makefiles to allow parallel library builds, as
      required by some software distributions. (Parallel execution
      of the test suite is not supported.)
    - The introduction of "deterministic" archiving (ar(1)) broke
      dependency analysis in the WCSLIB makefiles on the many
      systems where it is now enabled by default (i.e. binutils
      configured with --enable-deterministic-archives).
      Modified configure to force non-deterministic archiving
      during the library builds, thus repairing the dependency
      analysis.  However, the static object libraries are now
      reconstructed using deterministic archiving in the process of
      installing them.
    - Fixed problems with the dependency analysis, solely affecting
      code development.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - New wrappers for dpkeyi() and dpkeyd().
  From version 5.19.1:
  * Installation
    - Updated ./config/config.{guess,sub} to the latest versions
      from the GIT repository, timestamped 2018-07-18 and
      2018-07-25, respectively. The previous pair were dated
      2012-02-10 and 2012-04-18.
  From version 5.19:
  * C library
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug in handling distortion functions on
      axes with changed axis number in the subimage (i.e. via
      deletion or addition of an axis).
    - In various routines within dis.c, wcs.c, wcshdr.c, and
      wcspih.l, increased the size of various sprintf() output
      buffers to avert -Wformat-overflow warnings from gcc 8.1.0
      (with -DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2).
      Also fixed other warnings in these routines from gcc 8.1.0
      relating to -Wcast-function-type, -Wmaybe-uninitialized, and
      -Wunused-parameter.
    - In wcsutrn.l (the units alias translator used by wcsfix),
      recognise 'Deg', 'Degree', and 'Degrees' as aliases for
      'deg'.
    - Added a note to the prologue of spx.h explaining WCSLIB's use
      of Cox's air-to-vacuum transformation equation rather than
      the IUGG relation cited in WCS Paper III.
    - In the test suite, avert nuisance compiler warnings in tdis1.
      Made tsphdpa more robust in handling user coordinate input.
  * PGSBOX
    - In pgwcsl_(), avert nuisance warnings from gcc 8.1.0 relating
      to unused parameters (-Wunused-parameter).  Also averted
      nuisance compiler warnings in cpgtest.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware was not reading the -TAB table from the FITS file for
      alternate descriptions. Nor was wcsfix() ever invoked for
      them.
      Made it more robust in handling user input of coordinates for
      the -x and -w options.
    - Fixed compiler warnings from gcc 8.1.0 in HPXcvt
      (-Wmaybe-uninitialized), and wcsgrid (-Wformat-overflow).
  * Installation
    - Amended configure.ac to allow cross-compilation, and also
      updated the auxiliary configure scripts in the config/
      directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  9 22:36:05 UTC 2018 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.18:
  * C library
    - New routines introduced to preclude altering the global
      variables NPVMAX, NPSMAX, and NDPMAX, which determine how
      much memory to allocate for storing PVi_ma, PSi_ma, DPja, and
      DQia keyvalues: wcsinit(), lininit(), lindist(), and
      disinit().  These are now used by various WCSLIB routines,
      such as the header parsers, which previously temporarily
      altered the global variables, thus posing a thread hazard.
    - The Flex scanners, fitshdr(), wcsbth(), wcspih(), wcsulexe(),
      and wcsutrne(), have been rewritten as thin wrappers (with
      the same API) over scanners that were modified (with changed
      API) as required to use Flex's "reentrant" option.
      Consequently, they are now reentrant and should be
      thread-safe.  That also passes through to the deprecated
      wrappers, wcsulex() and wcsutrn().
    - Fixed memory leaks in lindist() and lincpy() uncovered by
      valgrind.
    - Test programs tfitshdr, tpih1, tpih2, and ttab3 are now
      careful to free all allocated memory before exit to defeat
      spurious reports of memory leaks by valgrind.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - New wrappers for wcsinit(), lininit(), lindist(), and
      disinit().
  * User manual
    - Updates and amendments in line with the above changes.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.14
      (was 1.8.13).
  From version 5.17:
  * C library
    - Fixed a memory leak in wcspih().
    - Fixed compiler warnings about comparison between signed and
      unsigned integers in tab.c. Also fixed warnings in other
      functions about unused parameters.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Fixed compiler warnings about comparison between signed and
      unsigned integers in several routines.
  * PGSBOX
    - Fixed a compiler warning about comparison between signed and
      unsigned ints.
  * Installation
    - Removed setgid permission on installation directories.
  * User manual
    - Minor updates and amendments.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.13 (was
      1.8.10).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  5 18:57:04 UTC 2017 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.16:
  * C library
    - Bug fix in spcfix() for the previous change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 17 17:04:51 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Rename the package from libwcs to wcslib. Added appropriate
  Provides/Obsoletes entries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 14 15:09:24 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Avoid unnecessary double emittance of %optflags into compiler
  line. Fixup groups for openSUSE Factory acceptance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 13 20:24:58 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Removed static library.
- Removed requirement of libwcs lib from libwcs-doc (not needed).
- Added Recommends entry for libwcs-doc in libwcs-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 19:05:38 UTC 2016 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.15:
  * C library
    - Bug fix in wcsulex.l for the previous change.  Reported, and
      fix supplied by Tammo Jan Dijkema.
    - In spcfix(), report the value of VELREF if ctype is
      translated from the AIPS convention.
  From version 5.14:
  * C library
    - In wcsulex.l and wcsutrn.l, applied a workaround for a memory
      leak introduced by a change (bug) in flex in Aug/2012.
      Reported, and fix supplied by Thomas Robitaille and Erik
      Bray.
  * Installation
    - In MacOSX, create symlink libwcs.dylib pointing to the
      dynamic library so that WCSLIB is linked dynamically by
      default. Requested by Paul Price.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 13:37:56 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 5.13
  * C library
    - In wcshdo(), provide floating-point format control via the 'ctrl'
      argument (formerly 'relax').
    - In wcspih(), PLATEID by itself is no longer sufficient to trigger a
      DSS translation (reported by James Allen).
    - In unitfix(), ensure that the message buffer cannot be overrun, e.g.
      by blank-padded unit strings (reported by Vishal Kasliwal).
- Update to version 5.12
  * C library
    - Bug fix in wcshdo() for CRVALia precision reported by Mihai Cara.
- Update to version 5.11
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih.l and dis.c for WAT distortions provided by
      Ole Streicher.
- Update to version 5.10
  * C library
    - In wcshdo(), allow output of floating point keyvalues to 15
      significant digits (was 14), mainly for astropy.
    - In wcspih(), allow unrecognised WAT projection types (tan, etc.) to
      pass without returning an error.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.
      Also fixed a bug triggered by SIP keywords in unconventional order,
      reported by Colin Slater, LSST.
- Update to version 5.9
  * C library
    - In disx2p(), make proper allowance for the possibility that the TPD
      and SIP forward and inverse distortion polynomials may not be of the
      same degree, reported by Martin Kuemmel.
    - Fix-ups in wcshdo() reported by Michael Droettboom, and several
      tidy-ups as well.
- Update to version 5.8
  * C library
    - DSS (Digitized Sky Survey) coordinates are now handled via TPD, as
      are the TNX and ZPX "projections".  New test script tdis3 and
      headers DSS.keyrec, TNX.keyrec, and ZPX.keyrec.
    - New function dishdo() can be used to set a flag that causes
      wcshdo() to write headers in the form of the distortion function
      used internally (usually TPD).
    - Added the capability, via DPja.DOCORR, for a distortion function to
      to compute an additive correction to the undistorted coordinates
      (rather than computing the distorted coordinates themselves).
    - Added auxiliary variables to TPD via DPja.AUX.jhat.COEFF.m.
    - Bug fix in wcshdo() for TPV, diagnosed by Michael Droettboom.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrapper for dishdo().
- Update to version 5.7
  * C library
    - Extended wcssub() to handle distortions (and thus wcscopy() also).
    This required axis mapping to be enabled for SIP distortions within
      WCSLIB.
    - wcshdo() now handles all distortions currently supported by WCSLIB:
      SIP, TPV, TPD, and Polynomial.
    - Bug fixes in sphx2s() and sphs2x() for non-unit vector strides for
      special-case rotations.
    - In wcsset(), modify wcsprm::ctype after translating TPV so that
      subsequent calls won't try to re-translate it, the PVi_ma records
      by then having been erased.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.  Also,
      restore NDPMAX after translating TPV.
    - Bug fixes in discpy(), disprt(), disset(), and disx2p().
    - Added disperr(), prjperr(), spcperr(), spxperr(), and tabperr() to
      complete the set and make reporting errors slightly more convenient.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware has a new option, -o, to print the wcsprm struct in the form
      of a FITS header using wcshdo().  Also, the -a option has been
      extended to allow a 0-relative numeric index for selecting an
      alternate WCS, where the alternates are sequenced alphabetically
      (without gaps) following the primary representation.
  * User manual
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.10 (was 1.8.9.1).
- Update to version 5.6
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih() and sipset() to account for the fact that the
      independent variables of the SIP polynomial are pixel coordinate
      offsets from CRPIXja, not pixel coordinates per se.  Diagnosed by
      Michael Droettboom.
    - Validated SIP and TPV handling by comparing the output of
      'wcsware -x' with that of wcstools 'xy2sky -d -n6' using astropy's
      SIP test headers, and separate SIP and TPV headers originating from
      the Palomar Transient Factory provided by David Shupe.
    - Changed SIP.keyrec so that CRPIX1 and CRPIX2 differ in value,
      thereby making tests sensitive to any confusion between the two.
- Update to version 5.5
  * C library
    - Bug fixes in wcspih.l for headers with multiple distortions, and for
      distortion parameter look-alike keywords.
    - Bug fix in sipset() uncovered by valgrind.
- Update to version 5.4.1
  * C library
    - Added a fairly lengthy section to the prologue of dis.h describing
      the Paper IV keywords and the distortion functions currently
      implemented.
  * User manual
    - Added a new section on WCSLIB version numbers.
- Update to version 5.4
  * C library
    - Further work on distortions: wcspih() now parses Paper IV distortion
      keywords (CPDISja, CQDISia, DPja, DQia, etc.), thus handling record-
      valued keywords.  SIP keywords are also parsed and translated into
      Paper IV keywords.
    - TPV, SIP, and whereever possible, the general Polynomial distortion
      function of Paper IV are now implemented by the Template Polynomial
      Distortion (TPD), that being a superset of TPV and SIP.  TPD, which
      can also handle 1D distortions and be used for inversions, is also
      supported as a separate distortion type defined by Paper IV
      keywords.  TPD efficiently handles 1D distortions and distortions
      without radial terms.
    - Specialized inverse distortions, such as defined by SIP, are
      implemented by TPD and recognized by disx2p(), which uses them to
      compute the initial approximation of its more precise iterative
      solution.
    - Generalized tdis1.c so that it can do closure tests for SIP headers,
      and added a SIP test header.
- Update to version 5.3.1
  * C library
    - Bug fix in test program tdis1.c reported by Martin Kuemmel.
- Update to version 5.3
  * First public release of WCSLIB 5.x with distortions capability.
  * C library
    - Changed disprm::dtype from char[16] to char[72] for reasons relating
      to header parsing.
    - More armour plating for disset() and friends.  They also use new
      utility functions wcsutil_dpkey_int() and wcsutil_dpkey_double() to
      extract numeric values from a dpkey struct.  This ensures their
      independence of the data type, the appropriate reporting of dpkey
      values by disprt(), and (eventually) the appropriate writing of DPja
      and DQia keyvalues by wcshdo().
    - Augmented the usage comments for dpfill() to explain how numeric
      values in a dpkey struct are handled.
  * Utilities
    - wcsware now uses wcserr to provide a backtrace on errors.  Also
      fixed a couple of minor annoyances relating to alternate
      representations.
- Update to version 5.2 beta
  * C library
    - Further development of disprm and related functions to implement
      the FITS keywords for distortions introduced in WCS Paper IV, thus
      changing disprm's ABI once again.
      disprm's model is now similar to wcsprm's handling of PVi_ma and
      PSi_ma, where the parsed keyrecords are loaded into a set of pvcard
      and pscard structs and wcsset() does the analysis.  For disprm, the
      parsed DPja or DQia keyrecords are loaded into a set of dpkey
      structs for disset() to analyse.
    - New function dpfill() aids in filling a dpkey struct.  Function
      disparms() has been removed.  It was no longer needed as
      disprm::parms[][] is now a "returned" member of the struct.
    - Implementation of the general Polynomial distortion function defined
      in Sect. 3.1 of WCS Paper IV.  The polynomial is defined in terms of
      Paper IV keywords.
    - Bug fixes in diswarp() and linwarp() reported by
      Michael Droettboom.
    - Test program tdis1 now tests a TPV header for closure in two ways:
      directly as a specialist TPV distortion (as before), then by
      translating it into a general polynomial distortion.  It then also
      tests that the TPV and polynomial distortions produce the same
      results.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Changes to the wrappers reflecting changes to disprm.
    - Bug fixes in fitshdr_f.c, and test programs tdis1.f, tfitshdr.f,
      twcsfix.f, and twcs.f.  All reported and/or fixed by Ole Streicher.
- Update to version 5.1 beta
  * C library
    - Distortions-related bug fixes to linset(), linp2x(), and linx2p().
    - New functions diswarp() and linwarp() compute statistics of the
      distortion functions over a specified domain.  Changed tdis1.c to
      test them.
    - Changes to disprm (so changed ABI).
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrappers for diswarp() and linwarp().
- Update to version 5.0 beta
  * C library
    - Implemented the framework of WCS Paper IV (the draft distortions
      proposal) based on a new struct, disprm, and suite of routines with
      header dis.h: disini(), disalloc(), discpy(), disfree(), disprt(),
      disset(), disp2x(), and disx2p().  New test program tdis1.
      Consequent changes to the linprm struct have altered its ABI, thus
      necessitating an increment in the WCSLIB major verion number.
    - wcsset() now recognises the "TPV" projection proposed in an early
      draft of WCS Paper II, and translates it into a disprm distortion -
      by request of Octavi Fors.  Additionally, it recognises "TPU" as
      equivalent to "TPV" but using a prior distortion (coming before the
      linear transformation matrix) rather than sequent (coming after it).
    - In wcspih() and wcsbth(), added relaxation flags to allow PC0i_0ja,
      PV0j_0ma, and PS0j_0ma (i.e. with leading zeroes on the index).
    - Added wcslib_version() to return the WCSLIB version number, as
      suggested by Ole Streicher.
    - Fixed problems uncovered by valgrind in prjbchk() (reported by
      Ger van Diepen), sphx2s(), sphx2s(), spcspxe(), spcxpse(), tabini(),
      and wcshdo_util().
    - Tidied up error reporting, particularly relating to translating
      status returns from lower-level functions.  New functions linperr()
      and celperr() report error messages from the structs they contain
      in addition to their own.
    - Changed output formatting of floating point values in linprt(),
      celprt(), prjprt(), spcprt(), tabprt(), and wcsprt().  Updated the
      test output reference files for tbth1, tpih1, twcsfix, twcssub, and
      twcstab to suit.
    - Tidied up several of the test programs, mostly to free memory
      explicitly before exit so that valgrind doesn't report (non-)leaks.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrappers for the new distortion functions.  New test programs
      tdis1.f and tdis2.f.
    - Updates following changes to wcspih() and wcsbth().
    - Added wrappers for linperr() and celperr().  Also added prjperr_(),
      spcperr_(), and tabperr_() as convenient wrappers on wcserr_prt().
    - Wrapper for wcslib_version().
  * Utilities
    - Added a "lint" function to wcsware to check a FITS header for
      conformance to the WCS standard.  New test program twcslint.
  * PGSBOX
    - In PGCRLB, fixed an incorrect use of the MOD intrinsic reported by
      'gfortran -std=f95' via Jean-Baptiste Marquette.
- Remove upstream-included build_flags.patch

- Update to version 4.25.1:
  * C library
    - Updated the test output reference files for tpih1, tbth1,
      twcsfix, and twcstab to account for the change to wcsset() in
      release 4.25.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.9.1 (was
      1.8.8).
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Updated the test output reference files for tpih1, twcsfix,
      and twcstab to account for the change to wcsset() in release
      4.25.
  From version 4.25:
  * C library
    - wcsset() now supplies default values for the auxiliary
      keywords EQUINOXa and RADESYSa if not present in the FITS
      header.
  From version 4.24:
  * C library
    - Changed API to wcscompare() to allow a tolerance to be
      specified for floating-point comparisons. Contributed by
      Michael Droettboom.
    - Documentation generation moved to doxygen 1.8.8 (was 1.8.4).
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Track the change to wcscompare().
  * User manual
    - Added mention of WCSLIB in "homebrew-science" (MacOSX) in the
      section on other packages.
- Removed autoconf build requirement (not needed).
- Added a patch (build_flags.patch) taken from Debian to add
  CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS to Makefiles.

- Update to version 4.23 (2014/05/11)
  * C library
    - New function wcscompare() compares two wcsprm structs for equality
      with varying degrees of strictness.  Test program twcscompare.
      Contributed by Michael Droettboom.
    - In wcssub(), fixed a bug uncovered by valgrind arising from
      allocation of insufficient memory for temporaries when a new axis
      is added.  Reported by Michael Droettboom.
    - In wcshdo(), don't write RESTFRQ or RESTWAV if zero.
      Also, to distinguish them from integer keyvalues, floating-
      point values will now always be written with an exponent or
      fractional part, ".0" being appended if necessary to achieve this.
      Suggested by Peter Weilbacher.
    - Fixed the '-h' option in twcshdr.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrapper for wcscompare().
- Update to version 4.22 (2014/04/13)
  * C library
    - In pcox2s() and pcos2x(), use alternative projection equations for
      greater numerical precision near theta == 0.  In cops2x(), return
      an exact result for theta at the poles.  Relaxed the tolerance for
      bounds checking a little in sflx2s().
    - Update to version 4.21 (2014/03/24)
  * C library
    - New function prjbchk() performs bounds checking on native spherical
      coordinates.  It is invoked automatically by the deprojection (x2s)
      routines if prjprm::bounds&4 is set.  Documented the new bounds
      checking implemented by prjbchk() in the prologue entry for
      wcsbchk().  Improvements to tprj1 to test the vector API of prjx2s()
      and to deal better with out-of-bounds native coordinates returned by
      it.
    - Bug fixes in the projection routines: in hpxx2s() relating to bounds
      checking, bug introduced at 4.20, reported by Michael Droettboom; in
      parx2s() and molx2s() relating to setting the stat vector; in
      hpxx2s() relating to implementation of the vector API; and in
        xphx2s() relating to setting an out-of-bounds value of phi.
  * Fortran wrappers
    - Wrapper for prjbchk().  Modified tprj1.f to track changes to the C
      version.
