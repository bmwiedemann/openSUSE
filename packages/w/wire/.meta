  <title>Compile-time Dependency Injection for Go</title>
  <description>Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting
	  components using dependency injection. Dependencies between
	  components are represented in Wire as function parameters,
	  encouraging explicit initialization instead of global variables.
	  Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection, code
	  written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written
	  initialization.</description>
