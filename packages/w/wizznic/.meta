  <title>Implementation of the arcade classic Puzznic</title>
  <description>Wizznic is a brick-matching puzzle-game, an improved version of Puzznic.
The challenge is to clear each level of bricks by moving the bricks next
to each other, this sounds a lot easier than it is.
The bricks are heavy, so you can only push them, not lift them up.
