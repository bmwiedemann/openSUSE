%description
wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response
processing, and custom reporting. Several example scripts are located in
scripts.
