%description
wfview controls modern Icom rigs using either a USB serial connection or OEM
network (ethernet or wifi) connection. Live, real-time spectrum analyzer data
are displayed, and rig controls are presented. Additional programs may tie into the
CIV bus using the pseudo-terminal device (linux and macOS), virtual serial port
loopback (windows), or hamlib-compatible rigctld server.
