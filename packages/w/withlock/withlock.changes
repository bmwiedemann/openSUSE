- I wrote a patch got-lock.patch to fix the trouble with the got-lock variable.
  I was testing the withlock and still had there the lock file after a
  program already end with exit code 0. I have look on the code together
  with our Python expert mvidner@suse.cz and we found the got-lock variable
  isn't marked ad global variable.I`ll send this to poeml@cmdline.net
  after we test it on our servers.

- update to 0.3
  * At exit, unlink the lock file only if a lock was actually obtained.
    When waiting for a lock (using -w option) and timing out, the file
    was removed nevertheless. Thanks Bernhard Wiedemann for finding this
    bug and providing such a good test case, so the fix was easy.

- withlock is now distributed as a tarball, which is generally 
  easier for packaging on some platforms (at least Solaris). The 
  only other change: updated copyright year.
