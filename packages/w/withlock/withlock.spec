%description
withlock is a locking wrapper script to make sure that some program isn't run
more than once. It is ideal to prevent periodic jobs spawned by cron from
stacking up.

The locks created are valid only while the wrapper is running, and thus will
never require a cleanup, as after a reboot. Thus, the wrapper is safe and easy
to use, and much better than implementing half-hearted locking within scripts.
