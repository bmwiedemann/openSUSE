  <title>Web Toolkit</title>
  <description>Wt is a C++ library and application server for developing and
deploying web applications. The widget-centric API is inspired by
existing C++ GUI APIs.	It offers complete abstraction of any
web-specific implementation details.  Most importantly, the entire
application is written in only one compiled language (C++), from which
the library generates the necessary HTML, Javascript, CGI, and AJAX
code.</description>
