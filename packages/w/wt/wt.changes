Mon Jan  8 13:26:18 UTC 2018 - eich@suse.com

- Updated to 4.0.2
  * Release 4.0.2 (November 24, 2017)
    This is a patch release that fixes a few problems with the build of 
  * Wt 4.0.1, and fixes a bug in Wt::Auth.
    Release 4.0.1 (November 21, 2017)
    This is a smaller release with mostly bugfixes, and some new features:
  * Added WContainerWidget::addNew() and similar methods
    Because writing code like this:
    auto text = root()->addWidget(std::make_unique<Wt::WText>("Hello!"));
    is a bit verbose, a shorthand was added that creates the widget and adds
    it
    to the container in one go:
    auto text = root()->addNew<Wt::WText>("Hello!");
    addNew forwards its arguments to the constructor, just like
    std::make_unique. Along those lines, we added
    WContainerWidget::insertNew()
    and WTemplate::bindNew().
    Added the <max-formdata-size> configuration option
    Previously, the maximum size of form data sent by Wt in a single POST
    request was capped to 5 MiB. In applications with a large amount of forms
    with a lot of data, that may not be enough, so <max-formdata-size> can be
    used to adjust this independently. Note that the maximum request size (and
    by consequence, the form data size) is still capped by <max-request-size>.
  * Release 4.0.0 (September 19, 2017)
    This release has all of the added features of Wt 3.3.8, but comes with 
    many notable changes. In general, Wt 4 employs the more modern C++ style 
    of C++11 and beyond. Support for compilers without sufficient C++11 
    support is dropped competely. Wt 4 aligns more with the C++ Core 
    Guidelines in a pragmatic way, while keeping the API familiar.
    Changes in Wt's memory model
    Header files now end in .h
    Replacements for Boost
    Removal of deprecated functionality
  * Release 3.3.8 (August 16, 2017)
    OpenID Connect support
    Wt::Dbo: added sql_value_traits for Wt::Json::Object and Wt::Json::Array.
    Added <allowed-hosts> configuration option for CORS
    Other small improvements:
  * Release 3.3.7 (March 31, 2017)
    This release fixes many bugs, but also introduces some new features:
    - WFileDropWidget
    - Scroll visibility
    - Touch events
    - Combined session tracking mode
    - Wraparound for WSpinBox and WTimeEdit
    - Some minor extra features
  * Release 3.3.6 (July 13, 2016)
    This release has a focus on bug fixes and some new features:
    - Support for WebSocket compression in wthttp
    - Time entry improvements
    - Skia version updated
    - Wt::Dbo
  For a full list of changes please refer to:

Mon Apr 11 15:46:03 UTC 2016 - dap.darkness@gmail.com

- Update to 3.3.5:
  * WCartesianChart has several new features. 
  * WAxisSliderWidget lets you easily focus on a particular range. 
  * WPainter, WJavascriptHandle, WCanvasPaintDevice functionality
    was implemented by making client-side interaction possible. 
  * WAnchor target (such as this window, or new window) moved to WLink. 
  * A new TargetDownload target was added for links.
  * The included SQLite version was updated.
  * Support for seconds editing in WTimePicker.
  * Before it was only possible to set the partial state of the
    WCheckbox when creating the Widget.
  * The WApplication::setConnectionMonitor() method will let the
    user register a Javascript object that will be notified.
  * Support for custom HTML tags for a widgets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 10 19:28:30 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 3.3.4
  * Support for dedicated session processes with wthttp connector.
  * WIdentityProxyModel : This new proxy model simply forwards the
    structure of the source model, without any transformation, and
    can be used for implementing proxy models that reimplement data(),
    but retain all other characteristics of the source model. 
  * Chart::WAbstractChart::setAutoLayoutEnabled() : Until now, you were
    responsible for configuring the padding around the chart area to
    accomodate for axis labels, titles, and legend. While this is
    still the default behaviour, we added an option to let the chart
    derive the required padding (using approximate font-metrics
    available server-side). 
  * Chart::WCartesianChart::setAxis() : Whereas previously a chart axis
    was a "value class", it is now a proper polyymorphic class, and you
    can provide your own implementation. In this way you can customize
    things like for example label strings. 
  * setPointSprite(): ability to define sprites for drawing a data series
  * pickSurface(): find out which points on a surface are under a given pixel
  * pickBar(): find out which points on a bar on are under a given pixel.
  * setIsoLevels(): draw iso lines (on the ground plane of the chart)
    corresponding to selected z values.
  * setClippingLinesEnabled(): ability to clip and optionally draw
    clipping planes
  * setIntersectionsEnabled(): ability to draw surface-surface
    intersection lines.

Tue Jul 12 07:11:42 UTC 2011 - poletti.marco@gmail.com

- Update to 3.1.10:
  * Backward-incompatibile change: The signature of the virtual
    method WWidget::setHidden() has changed. This will break

    object.

    supporting multiple WPainters on a single paint device.
  * Many other improvements, too many to be listed here.
