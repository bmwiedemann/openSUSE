  <title>WireGuard userspace tools</title>
  <description>WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and uses
state-of-the-art cryptography (the &quot;Noise&quot; protocol). It aims to be
faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding
the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.

This package contains command-line tools to interact with the
WireGuard kernel module.  Currently, it provides only a single tool:

wg: set and retrieve configuration of WireGuard interfaces
