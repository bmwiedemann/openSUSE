    <comment>- update to v0.0.15
  * Fixed: (BUG) RCD_RETURN_FALSE() returns RCD_TRUE
- update to v0.0.14
  * Update: guilog.h v0.2
  * Fixed: Info panel: BG &amp; FG colors were theme-dependent, which
    could make the panel look &quot;ugly&quot; or even completely unreadable.
    Now the FG is forced to black and the BG is white.
- update to v0.0.13
  * Fixed: (GCC 6.x): silenced some warnings (false-positives)
    regarding &quot;possibly unitialized variables&quot; in EDID_class.cpp
  * Fixed: (GCC 6.x, C11 mode): wxEDID_Main.h: C11 requires a space
    between literal and string macro [-Wliteral-suffix].
  * Update: returncode.h v0.8.3 
- Initial commit

    <comment>- Update to v0.0.17
Added
  * support for wxWidgets v3.1.x : *experimental*
Changed
  * DTD panel: all the controls are now configured to use default
    min sizes - this is rather a disadventage, because f.e. the
    default controls in gtk3 are ridiculously big. However,
    the minimal App frame size is now re-calculated dynamically,
    basing on the min. size reported by the DTD sizer - so this
    is a more flexible solution.
  * Dropped support for old wxWidgets versions (&lt;3.0.0).
  * Changed proportions of AUI panes.
Fixed
  * DTD panel: dtd_screen: background was erased twice on resize
    event → now the refreshing is performed in a single call to
    the paint event.
  * wxWidgets v3.1.x wxGrid::SetCellValue(wxString&amp;, int, int)
    is deprecated, new version is wxGrid::SetCellValue(int, int,
    wxString&amp;)
  * wxWidgets v3.1.x: wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGE is no longer
    supported → renamed to wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED
  * wxEDID_Frame::evt_frame_size() missing call to sizer-&gt;Layout()
    → quick resizing of the frame could cause incorrect placement
    of child windows on the DTD panel.
  * (BUG::old): DTD_Ctor_WriteInt(): value change event log:
    missing field names. Only the first letter of field name was
    printed due to missing conversion from ASCII to wxString.
  * (BUG::old): EDID_class.cpp: wxString AltDesc wasn't really
    initializing the alternative desriptors' &quot;Desc&quot; fields.
    Now the AltDesc is just a char string, and the &quot;Desc&quot; fields
    are proprly initialized by calling wxString::FromUTF8(AltDesc).
  * DTD_Ctor_WriteInt(), WriteField(): value change event log:
    print the whole message string in a single call to
    guilog::DoLog() - eliminates printing of multiple timestamps
    per event.
  * Corrected few textual descriptions of EDID fields.

    <comment>- Update to v0.0.17
Changed
  * Increased default Log Window size from 400x300 to 500x400.
  * All panels &amp; controls are now using default system font instead
    of fixed one.
Fixed
  * (BUG::wxSmith) Menu &quot;Quit&quot; and &quot;About&quot; handlers were connected
    dynamically in the frame constructor, even though they were
    already present in the static event table.
  * Options menu: all menu items except &quot;Log window&quot; should stay
    disabled until edid data is loaded/imported.

    <comment>- Update to v0.0.18
Fixed

Added

    ratio of the DTD preview screen.
  * DTD_Constructor: active screen area size is now displayed on
    the DTD screen preview. H/V borders are excluded from active
    area.

    <comment>- Add wxedid-no-implicit-string-conversion.patch
  Works around compilation issues with openSUSE’s wxWidgets
  packages, which do not enable implicit string type conversion.
- Update to v0.0.20
Added
  * Added: Loading/Importing EDID files from path passed as cmd
    line argument.
  * Added: Save settings: last used directory + last opened file,
    dtd_keep_aspect_ratio
Changed
  * lower-case name for the final executable: wxEDID -&gt; wxedid
Fixed
  * (BUG) cea_y42c_cl::gen_data_layout() never tested: buggy code,
    memory corruption. Program crash if EDID data contains
    &quot;YCBCR 4:2:0 Capability Map Data Block&quot;
    (TagCode=7, ExtTagCode=15)
- Update to v0.0.19
Fixed
  * evt_blktree_sel(): the cell editor must be closed before
    switching to newly selected data block. Otherwise the cell
    editor can be &quot;orphaned&quot; and its window stays opened until
    another cell editor is activated. This problem was visible
    only when the cell editor was activated from Value Selector
    Menu event and if evt_blktree_sel() was invoked with opened
    cell editor.
  * EDID_cl::ProdWk(): wxString::operator&lt;&lt;() requires type casting
    to &lt;int&gt; when appending a byte -&gt; otherwise &lt;u8_t&gt; is
    interpreted as &lt;char&gt;
  * menu Options::&quot;Ignore EDID errors&quot; must be always enabled,
    because otherwise the option will be unavailable until a valid
    EDID structure is loaded.
Added
  * Menu Help::Flags &amp; Types: info about flags displayed in the
    block data grid.
