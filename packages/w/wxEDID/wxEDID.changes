- Add wxedid-no-implicit-string-conversion.patch
  Works around compilation issues with openSUSE’s wxWidgets
  packages, which do not enable implicit string type conversion.
- Update to v0.0.20
Added
  * Added: Loading/Importing EDID files from path passed as cmd
    line argument.
  * Added: Save settings: last used directory + last opened file,
    dtd_keep_aspect_ratio

Changed
  * lower-case name for the final executable: wxEDID -> wxedid

Fixed
  * (BUG) cea_y42c_cl::gen_data_layout() never tested: buggy code,
    memory corruption. Program crash if EDID data contains
    "YCBCR 4:2:0 Capability Map Data Block"
    (TagCode=7, ExtTagCode=15)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 17:21:10 UTC 2020 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to v0.0.19
Fixed
  * evt_blktree_sel(): the cell editor must be closed before
    switching to newly selected data block. Otherwise the cell
    editor can be "orphaned" and its window stays opened until
    another cell editor is activated. This problem was visible
    only when the cell editor was activated from Value Selector
    Menu event and if evt_blktree_sel() was invoked with opened
    cell editor.
  * EDID_cl::ProdWk(): wxString::operator<<() requires type casting
    to <int> when appending a byte -> otherwise <u8_t> is
    interpreted as <char>
  * menu Options::"Ignore EDID errors" must be always enabled,
    because otherwise the option will be unavailable until a valid
    EDID structure is loaded.

Added
  * Menu Help::Flags & Types: info about flags displayed in the
    block data grid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 24 13:57:06 UTC 2019 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to v0.0.18
Fixed
  * Removed unused "Hex View" menu item

Added
  * Menu Options: "DTD preview: keep aspect ratio": keep aspect
    ratio of the DTD preview screen.
  * DTD_Constructor: active screen area size is now displayed on
    the DTD screen preview. H/V borders are excluded from active
    area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 23 18:43:51 UTC 2018 - Martin Herkt <9+suse@cirno.systems>

- Update to v0.0.17
Changed
  * Increased default Log Window size from 400x300 to 500x400.
  * All panels & controls are now using default system font instead
    of fixed one.

Fixed
  * (BUG::wxSmith) Menu "Quit" and "About" handlers were connected
    dynamically in the frame constructor, even though they were
    already present in the static event table.
  * Options menu: all menu items except "Log window" should stay
    disabled until edid data is loaded/imported.

- Update to v0.0.16
Added
  * support for wxWidgets v3.1.x : *experimental*

Changed
  * DTD panel: all the controls are now configured to use default
    min sizes - this is rather a disadventage, because f.e. the
    default controls in gtk3 are ridiculously big. However,
    the minimal App frame size is now re-calculated dynamically,
    basing on the min. size reported by the DTD sizer - so this
    is a more flexible solution.
  * Dropped support for old wxWidgets versions (<3.0.0).
  * Changed proportions of AUI panes.

Fixed
  * DTD panel: dtd_screen: background was erased twice on resize
    event → now the refreshing is performed in a single call to
    the paint event.
  * wxWidgets v3.1.x wxGrid::SetCellValue(wxString&, int, int)
    is deprecated, new version is wxGrid::SetCellValue(int, int,
    wxString&)
  * wxWidgets v3.1.x: wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGE is no longer
    supported → renamed to wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED
  * wxEDID_Frame::evt_frame_size() missing call to sizer->Layout()
    → quick resizing of the frame could cause incorrect placement
    of child windows on the DTD panel.
  * (BUG::old): DTD_Ctor_WriteInt(): value change event log:
    missing field names. Only the first letter of field name was
    printed due to missing conversion from ASCII to wxString.
  * (BUG::old): EDID_class.cpp: wxString AltDesc wasn't really
    initializing the alternative desriptors' "Desc" fields.
    Now the AltDesc is just a char string, and the "Desc" fields
    are proprly initialized by calling wxString::FromUTF8(AltDesc).
  * DTD_Ctor_WriteInt(), WriteField(): value change event log:
    print the whole message string in a single call to
    guilog::DoLog() - eliminates printing of multiple timestamps
    per event.
  * Corrected few textual descriptions of EDID fields.

- update to v0.0.15
  * Fixed: (BUG) RCD_RETURN_FALSE() returns RCD_TRUE

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 30 16:49:24 UTC 2017 - 9@cirno.systems

- update to v0.0.14
  * Update: guilog.h v0.2
  * Fixed: Info panel: BG & FG colors were theme-dependent, which
    could make the panel look "ugly" or even completely unreadable.
    Now the FG is forced to black and the BG is white.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  5 23:46:02 UTC 2017 - 9@cirno.systems

- update to v0.0.13
  * Fixed: (GCC 6.x): silenced some warnings (false-positives)
    regarding "possibly unitialized variables" in EDID_class.cpp
  * Fixed: (GCC 6.x, C11 mode): wxEDID_Main.h: C11 requires a space
    between literal and string macro [-Wliteral-suffix].
  * Update: returncode.h v0.8.3
