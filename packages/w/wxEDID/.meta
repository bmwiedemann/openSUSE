  <title>Extended Display Identification Data editor</title>
  <description>wxEDID is a wxWidgets - based EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) editor.
This is an early stage of development, allowing to modify the base EDID v1.3+ structure and CEA-861 (as first extension block).
Besides normal editor functionality, the app has been equipped with a DTD constructor, which aims to ease timings selection/editing. It's also possible to export and import EDID data to/from text files (hex ASCII format) and also to save the structures as a human-readable text.</description>
