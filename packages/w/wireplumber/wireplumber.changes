Tue Jun  4 22:08:54 UTC 2024 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.5.3:
  * Fixes:
    - Fix a long standing issue that would cause many device nodes
      to have inconsistent naming, with a '.N' suffix (where N is
      a number >= 2) being appended at seemingly random times.
    - Fix an issue that would cause unavailable device profiles to
      be selected if they were previously stored in the state file,
      sometimes requiring users to manually remove the state file
      to get things working again.
    - Fix an occasional crash that could sometimes be triggered by
      hovering the volume icon on the KDE taskbar, and possibly
      other similar actions.
    - Fix camera device deduplication logic when the same device
      is available through both V4L2 and libcamera, and the
      libcamera one groups multiple V4L2 devices together.
    - Fix applying the default volume on streams that have no
      volume previously stored in the state file.
    - Fix an issue that would prevent some camera nodes,
      in some cases, from being destroyed when the camera device
      is removed.
    - Fix an issue that would cause video stream nodes to be
      linked with audio smart filters, if smart audio filters were
      configured.
    - Fix an issue that would cause WP to re-activate device
      profiles even though they were already active.
    - Configuration files in standard JSON format (starting with a
      '{', among other things) are now correctly parsed.
    - Fix overriding non-container values when merging JSON
      objects.
    - Functions marked with WP_PRIVATE_API are now also marked as
      non-introspectable in the gobject-introspection metadata.
  * Improvements:
    - Logging on the systemd journal now includes the log topic
      and also the log level and location directly on the message
      string when the log level is high enough, which is useful
      for gathering additional context in logs submitted by users.
    - Add a video-only profile in wireplumber.conf, for systems
      where only camera & screensharing are to be used.
    - Improve seat state monitoring so that Bluetooth devices are
      only enabled when the user is active on a local seat,
      instead of allowing remote users as well.
    - Improve how main filter nodes are detected for the smart
      filters.
    - Add Lua method to merge JSON containers.
- Remove patch already included upstream:
  * 0001-lua-json-fix-error-ouput.patch
  * 0002-lua-json-add-method-to-merge-json-containers.patch
  * 0003-json-utils-fix-overriding-of-non-container-values-when.patch

  * 0006-linking-return-after-aborting-transition.patch
  * 0007-state-stream-fix-using-default-volume.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 25 13:28:01 UTC 2024 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Add patches from upstream to fix a crash for aborted links:
  * 0004-transition-fix-memleak-when-error-set.patch
  * 0005-transition-ensure-single-completion-and-finish.patch
  * 0006-linking-return-after-aborting-transition.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 16:23:47 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Better fix for (bsc#1223916) that basically turns the main
  profile into the (to be in 0.5.3) video-only profile unless
  wireplumber-audio is installed which now turns the main profile
  into exactly upstream's main profile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  6 07:41:23 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix a json log issue:
  * 0001-lua-json-fix-error-ouput.patch
- Add patch from upstream to add a method to merge json containers:
  * 0002-lua-json-add-method-to-merge-json-containers.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix merging a particular case
  of configuration options:
  * 0003-json-utils-fix-overriding-of-non-container-values-when.patch
- Fix wireplumber not starting successfully when audio support is
  not enabled since the main profile now requires it. The best
  option would be to use a video-only profile but it's too late
  to change the way wireplumber is started in SLE/Leap, so the
  solution just makes audio/bluetooth optional for now
  (bsc#1223916)
  * split-config-file.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  1 07:53:59 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.5.1:
  * Highlights:
    - Added a guide documenting how to migrate configuration from
      0.4 to 0.5, also available online at:
      https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/daemon/configuration/migration.html
      If you are packaging WirePlumber for a distribution, please
      consider informing users about this. Installing the
      wireplumber-doc subpackage, this file can be read by running:
      xdg-open /usr/share/doc/wireplumber/html/daemon/configuration/migration.html
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed an odd issue where microphones would stop being usable
      when a Bluetooth headset was connected in the HSP/HFP profile
      (#598, !620)
    - Fixed an issue where it was not possible to store the
      volume/mute state of system notifications (#604)
    - Fixed a rare crash that could occur when a node was destroyed
      while the 'select-target' event was still being processed
      (!621)

      0.4.x Lua configuration files are found in the system. (#611)
    - The "policy-dsp" script, used in Asahi Linux to provide a
      software DSP for Apple Sillicon devices, has now been ported
      to 0.5 properly and documented (#619, !627)
- Remove patch already included upstream:
  * 0001-filter-utils-fix-handling-of-targetless-smart-filters.patch
- Enable documentation generation and create new doc subpackage
  including the documentation that can be read by running:
  xdg-open /usr/share/doc/wireplumber/html/index.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 08:30:48 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix all input sources only working
  when bluetooth profile is set to HSF/HFP, which was a regression
  in 0.5.0 (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#598):
  * 0001-filter-utils-fix-handling-of-targetless-smart-filters.patch 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Avoid %if %{pkg_vcmp gcc < 8}, instead replicate the condition
  from the BuildRequires section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 16:34:10 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.5.0:
  * Changes:
    - Bumped the minimum required version of PipeWire to 1.0.2,
      because we make use of the 'api.bluez5.internal' property of
      the BlueZ monitor (!613)
    - Improved the naming of Bluetooth nodes when the
      auto-switching loopback node is present (!614)
    - Updated the documentation on "settings", the Bluetooth
      monitor, the Access configuration, the file search locations
      and added a document on how to modify the configuration file
      (#595, !616)
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed checking for available routes when selecting the
      default node (!609)
    - Fixed an issue that was causing an infinite loop storing
      routes in the state file (!610)
    - Fixed the interpretation of boolean values in the alsa
      monitor rules (#586, !611)
    - Fixes a Lua crash when we have 2 smart filters, one with a
      target and one without (!612)
    - Fixed an issue where the default nodes would not be updated
      when the currently selected default node became unavailable
      (#588, !615)
    - Fixed an issue that would cause the Props (volume, mute, etc)
      of loopbacks and other filter nodes to not be restored at
      startup (#577, !617)
    - Fixed how some constants were represented in the
      gobject-introspection file, mostly by converting them from
      defines to enums (#540, #591)
    - Fixed an issue using WirePlumber headers in other projects
      due to redefinition of G_LOG_DOMAIN (#571)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Set minimum pipewire version to 1.0.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 15:43:02 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Revert that last change. Obsoletes shouldn't be used for that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  6 11:27:41 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Obsolete libwireplumber-0_4-0 from libwireplumber-0_5-0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 19:29:02 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix a typo a lua script:
  * 0001-scripts-fix-typo-in-rescan-virtual-links.lua.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 05:36:27 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.90 (0.5.0 RC1)
  * Highlights:
    - The configuration system has been changed back to load files
      from the WirePlumber configuration directories, such as
      /etc/wireplumber and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireplumber, unlike in
      the pre-releases. This was done because issues were observed
      with installations that use a different prefix for pipewire
      and wireplumber. If you had a wireplumber.conf file in
      /etc/pipewire or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire, you should move
      it to /etc/wireplumber or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireplumber
      respectively (!601)
    - The internal base directories lookup system now also respects
      the XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables,
      and their default values as per the XDG spec, so it is
      possible to install configuration files also in places like
      /etc/xdg/wireplumber and override system-wide data paths
      (!601)
    - wpctl now has a settings subcommand to show, change and
      delete settings at runtime. This comes with changes in the
      WpSettings system to validate settings using a schema that is
      defined in the configuration file. The schema is also
      exported on a metadata object, so it is available to any
      client that wants to expose WirePlumber settings (!599, !600)
    - The WpConf API has changed to not be a singleton and support
      opening arbitrary config files. The main config file now
      needs to be opened prior to creating a WpCore and passed to
      the core using a property. The core uses that without letting
      the underlying pw_context open and read the default
      client.conf. The core also closes the WpConf after all
      components are loaded, which means all the config loading is
      done early at startup. Finally, WpConf loads all sections
      lazily, keeping the underlying files memory mapped until it
      is closed and merging them on demand (!601, !606)
- Remove patch that's already included:
  * 0001-wpctl-add-settings-subcomand-to-show_-delete-or-change.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 07:29:52 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to remove the "clear-persistent"
  sub-command and add a "settings" sub-command:
  * 0001-wpctl-add-settings-subcomand-to-show_-delete-or-change.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 15 07:23:41 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.82 (0.5.0 pre-release 2)
  * Highlights:
    - Bluetooth auto-switching is now implemented with a virtual
      source node. When an application links to it, the actual
      device switches to the HSP/HFP profile to provide the real
      audio stream. This is a more robust solution that works with
      more applications and is more user-friendly than the previous
      application whitelist approach
    - Added support for dynamic log level changes via the PipeWire
      settings metadata. Also added support for log level patterns
      in the configuration file
    - The "persistent" (i.e. stored) settings approach has changed
      to use two different metadata objects: sm-settings and
      persistent-sm-settings. Changes in the former are applied in
      the current session but not stored, while changes in the
      latter are stored and restored at startup. Some work was also
      done to expose a wpctl interface to read and change these
      settings, but more is underway
    - Several WirePlumber-specific node properties that used to be
      called target.* have been renamed to node.* to match the
      PipeWire convention of node.dont-reconnect. These are also
      now fully documented
  * Other changes:
    - Many documentation updates
    - Added support for SNAP container permissions
    - Fixed multiple issues related to restoring the Route
      parameter of devices, which includes volume state
    - Smart filters can now be targetted by specific streams
      directly when the filter.smart.targetable property is set
    - Ported the mechanism to override device profile priorities in
      the configuration, which is used to re-prioritize Bluetooth
      codecs
    - WpSettings is no longer a singleton class and there is a
      built-in component to preload an instance of it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 16:11:12 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.81
  * Highlights:
    - Lua scripts have been refactored to use the new event
      dispatcher API, which allows them to be split into multiple
      small fragments that react to events in a specified order.
      This allows scripts to be more modular and easier to
      maintain, as well as more predictable in terms of execution
      order.
    - The configuration system has been refactored to use a single
      SPA-JSON file, like PipeWire does, with support for fragments
      that can override options. This file is also now loaded using
      PipeWire's configuration API, which effectively means that
      the file is now loaded from the PipeWire configuration
      directories, such as /etc/pipewire and
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire.
    - The configuration system now has the concept of profiles,
      which are groups of components that can be loaded together,
      with the ability to mark certain components as optional. This
      allows having multiple configurations that can be loaded
      using the same configuration file. Optional components also
      allow loading the same profile gracefully on different
      setups, where some components may not be available (ex,
      loading of the session D-Bus plugin on a system-wide PipeWire
      setup now does not fail).
    - Many configuration options are now exposed in the sm-settings
      metadata, which allows changing them at runtime. This can be
      leveraged in the future to implement configuration tools that
      can modify WirePlumber's behaviour dynamically, without
      restarting.
    - A new "filters" system has been implemented, which allows
      specifying chains of "filter" nodes to be dynamically linked
      in-between streams and devices. This is achieved with certain
      properties and metadata that can be set on the filter nodes
      themselves.
    - The default linking policy now reads some more target.*
      properties from nodes, which allows fine-tuning some aspects
      of their linking behaviour, such as whether they are allowed
      to be re-linked or whether an error should be sent to the
      client if they cannot be linked.
    - Some state files have been renamed and some have changed
      format to use JSON for storing complex values, such as
      arrays. This may cause some of the old state to be lost on
      upgrade, as there is no transition path implemented.
    - The libcamera and V4L2 monitors have a "device deduplication"
      logic built-in, which means that for each physical camera
      device, only one node will be created, either from libcamera
      or V4L2, depending on which one is considered better for the
      device. This is mainly to avoid having multiple nodes for the
      same camera device, which can cause confusion when looking at
      the list of available cameras in applications.
- Bump apiver to 0.5
- Rewrite split-config-file.py to work with the new config
  subsystem
- Remove patch which isn't applying anymore and whose fix is
  now handled by the split-config-file.py script:
  * fix-bsc1219411.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  5 06:46:58 UTC 2024 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch to only enable bluetooth when audio support is enabled
  by installing wireplumber-audio (bsc#1219411):
  * fix-bsc1219411.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  5 19:28:42 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.17:
  * Fixes:
    - Fix a reference counting issue in the object managers that
      could cause crashes due to memory corruption.
    - Fix an issue with filters linking to wrong targets, often
      with two sets of links.
    - Fix a crash in the endpoints policy that would show up when
      log messages were enabled at level 3 or higher.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 26 11:02:03 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.16:
  * Additions:
    - Added a new "sm-objects" script that allows loading objects
      on demand via metadata entries that describe the object to
      load; this can be used to load pipewire modules, such as
      filters or network sources/sinks, on demand
    - Added a mechanism to override device profile priorities in
      the configuration, mainly as a way to re-prioritize Bluetooth
      codecs, but this also can be used for other devices
    - Added a mechanism in the endpoints policy to allow connecting
      filters between a certain endpoint's virtual sink and the
      device sink; this is specifically intended to allow plugging
      a filter-chain to act as equalizer on the Multimedia endpoint
    - Added wp_core_get_own_bound_id() method in WpCore
  * Changes:
    - PipeWire 0.3.68 is now required
    - policy-dsp now has the ability to hide hardware nodes behind
      the DSP sink to prevent hardware misuse or damage
    - JSON parsing in Lua now allows keys inside objects to be
      without quotes
    - Added optional argument in the Lua JSON parse() method to
      limit recursions, making it possible to partially parse a
      JSON object
    - It is now possible to pass nil in Lua object constructors
      that expect an optional properties object; previously,
      omitting the argument was the only way to skip the properties
    - The endpoints policy now marks the endpoint nodes as
      "passive" instead of marking their links, adjusting for the
      behavior change in PipeWire 0.3.68
    - Removed the "passive" property from si-standard-link, since
      only nodes are marked as passive now
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed the wpctl clear-default command to completely clear all
      the default nodes state instead of only the last set default
    - Reduced the amount of globals that initially match the
      interest in the object manager
    - Used an idle callback instead of pw_core_sync() in the object
      manager to expose tmp globals
- Remove patches included upstream:
  * 0001-object-manager-reduce-the-amount-of-globals-that-initially.patch
  * 0002-object-manager-use-an-idle-callback-to-expose-tmp-globals.patch
  * 0001-policy-dsp-add-ability-to-hide-parent-nodes.patch
- Update split-config-file.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 31 08:30:21 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream that fixes too many matches for property
  interest:
  * 0001-object-manager-reduce-the-amount-of-globals-that-initially.patch
- Add patch from upstream that fixes an odd failure of a test after
  applying the previous patch:
  * 0002-object-manager-use-an-idle-callback-to-expose-tmp-globals.patch
- Add patch from upstream that adds ability to hide parent nodes,
  which is useful to prevent hardware misuse or damage by poorly
  behaved/configured clients:
  * 0001-policy-dsp-add-ability-to-hide-parent-nodes.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 13 07:17:56 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.15:
  * Additions:
    - A new "DSP policy" module has been added; its purpose is to
      automatically load a filter-chain when a certain hardware
      device is present, so that audio always goes through this
      software DSP before reaching the device. This is mainly to
      support Apple M1/M2 devices, which require a software DSP
      to be always present
    - WpImplModule now supports loading module arguments directly
      from a SPA-JSON config file; this is mainly to support DSP
      configuration for Apple M1/M2 and will likely be reworked
      for 0.5
    - Added support for automatically combining Bluetooth LE Audio
      device sets (e.g. pairs of earbuds) (!500)
    - Added command line options in wpctl to display device/node
      names and nicknames instead of descriptions
    - Added zsh completions file for wpctl
    - The device profile selection policy now respects the
      device.profile property if it is set on the device; this is
      useful to hand-pick a profile based on static configuration
      rules (alsa_monitor.rules)
  * Changes/Fixes:
    - Linking policy now sends an error to the client before
      destroying the node, if it determines that the node cannot be
      linked to any target; this fixes error reporting on the
      client side
    - Fixed a crash in suspend-node that could happen when
      destroying virtual sinks that were loaded from another
      process such as pw-loopback
    - Virtual machine default period size has been bumped to 1024
    - Updated bluez5 default configuration, using bluez5.roles
      instead of bluez5.headset-roles now (!498)
    - Disabled Bluetooth autoconnect by default (!514)
    - Removed RestrictNamespaces option from the systemd services
      in order to allow libcamera to load sandboxed IPA modules
    - Fixed a JSON encoding bug with empty strings
    - Lua code can now parse strings without quotes from SPA-JSON
    - Added some missing \since annotations and made them show up
      in the generated gobject-introspection file, to help bindings
      generators
- Add zsh-completion subpackage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 19 17:26:12 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Require wireplumber-audio if pipewire-jack is installed.
- Recommend pipewire-jack in wireplumber-audio.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 10 23:20:12 UTC 2023 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.14:
  * Additions
    - Add support for managing Bluetooth-MIDI, complementing the
      parts that were merged in PipeWire recently.
    - Add a default volume configuration option for streams whose
      volume has never been saved before; that allows starting new
      streams at a lower volume than 100% by default, if desired.
    - Add support for managing link errors and propagating them to
      the client(s) involved. This allows better error handling on
      the application side in case a format cannot be negotiated -
      useful in video streams.
    - snd_aloop devices are now described as being "Loopback"
      devices.
    - ALSA nodes in the pro audio profile now get increased graph
      priority, so that they are more likely to become the driver
      in the graph.
    - Add support for disabling libcamera nodes & devices with
      node.disabled and device.disabled, like it works for ALSA
      and V4L2.
- Drop reduce-meson-required-version.patch: openSUSE Leap 15.3 is
  no longer supported.
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-alsa-monitor-handle-snd_aloop-devices-better.patch
  * 0001-spa-json-make-sure-we-only-add-encoded-string-data.patch
  * 0001-m-lua-scripting-ignore-string-integer-table-keys-when-constructing-a-JSON-Array-Object.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 13 10:51:07 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Backport the workaround from SLE/Leap for the bug in systemd
  scripts that didn't set the default enable state for the
  wireplumber user service when installing wireplumber. The bug
  (boo#1200485) was fixed but that's only for new installations
  while this workaround will fix old installations (boo#1202008).
  This is used to automatically fix installations of
  SLE 15 SP4/Leap 15.4 that were not updated during it's lifetime
  and upgrade directly to SP5/15.5 .

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 12:41:28 UTC 2023 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add upstream patches to fix glfo#pipewire/pipewire#2214 and to
  handle better non-null terminated strings: 
  * 0001-alsa-monitor-handle-snd_aloop-devices-better.patch
  * 0001-spa-json-make-sure-we-only-add-encoded-string-data.patch
  * 0001-m-lua-scripting-ignore-string-integer-table-keys-when-constructing-a-JSON-Array-Object.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 14:43:46 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.13:
  * Additions
    - Add bluetooth SCO (HSP/HFP) hardware offload support,
      together with an example script that enables this
      functionality on the PinePhone.
    - Encoded audio (mp3, aac, etc...) can now be passed through,
      if this mode is supported by both the application and the
      device.
    - The v4l2 monitor now also respects the ``node.disabled`` and
      ``device.disabled`` properties inside rules.
    - Add "Firefox Developer Edition" to the list of applications
      that are allowed to trigger a bluetooth profile auto-switch.
    - Add support in the portal access script to allow newly
      plugged cameras to be immediately visible to the portal
      applications.
  * Fixes
    - Work around an issue that would prevent streams from properly
      linking when using effects software like EasyEffects and
      JamesDSP.
    - Fix destroying pavucontrol-qt monitor streams after the node
      that was being monitored is destroyed.
    - Fix a crash in the alsa.lua monitor that could happen when a
      disabled device was removed and re-added.
    - Fix a rare crash in the metadata object.
    - Fix a bug where a restored node target would override the
      node target set by the application on the node's properties.
  * Packaging
    - Add build options to compile wireplumber's library, daemon
      and tools independently.
    - Add a build option to disable unit tests that require the
      dbus daemon.
    - Stop using fakesink/fakesrc in the unit tests to be able to
      run them on default pipewire installations. Compiling the spa
      ``test`` plugin is no longer necessary.
    - Add pkg-config and header information in the gir file.
- Rebase reduce-meson-required-version.patch
- Drop patches already upstream:
  * 0001-alsa.lua-remove-the-disabled-entities-from-the-names-table.patch
  * 0001-policy-node-wait-for-unactivated-links-instead-of-removing.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 15 08:21:15 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to work around a problem when a link is
  not activated:
  * 0001-policy-node-wait-for-unactivated-links-instead-of-removing.patch

- Add patch from upstream to fix handling null devices which result
  in lua exceptions:
  * 0001-alsa.lua-remove-the-disabled-entities-from-the-names-table.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  4 13:01:17 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.12:
  * Changes
    - WirePlumber now maintains a stack of previously configured
      default nodes and prioritises to one of those when the
      actively configured default node becomes unavailable, before
      calculating the next default using priorities.
    - Updated bluetooth scripts to support the name changes that
      happened in PipeWire 0.3.59 and also support the experimental
      Bluetooth LE functionality.
    - Changed the naming of bluetooth nodes to not include the
      profile in it; this allows maintaining existing links when
      switching between a2dp and hfp.
    - The default volume for new outputs has changed to be 40% in
      cubic scale (= -24 dB) instead of linear
      (= 74% cubic / -8 dB) that it was before.
    - The default volume for new inputs has changed to be 100%
      rather than following the default for outputs.
    - Added ``--version`` flag on the wireplumber executable.
    - Added ``--limit`` flag on ``wpctl set-volume`` to limit the
      higher volume that can be set (useful when incrementing
      volume with a keyboard shortcut that calls into wpctl).
    - The properties of the alsa midi node can now be set in the
      config files.
  * Fixes
    - Fixed a crash in lua code that would happen when running in a
      VM.
    - Fixed a crash that would happen when re-connecting to D-Bus.
    - Fixed a mistake in the code that would cause device
      reservation not to work properly.
    - Fixed ``wpctl clear-default`` to accept 0 as a valid setting ID.
    - Fixed the logic of choosing the best profile after the active
      profile of a device becomes unavailable
    - Fixed a regression that would cause PulseAudio "corked"
      streams to not properly link and cause busy loops.
    - Fixed an issue parsing spa-json objects that have a nested
      object as the value of their last property.
- Rebase reduce-meson-required-version.patch
- Drop patches already upstream:
  * fix-alsa.patch
  * 0001-dbus-fix-crash-when-trying-to-reconnect.patch
  * 398.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 21:07:13 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Add 398.patch -- policy-node: fix potential rescan loop to
  prevent high cpu usage (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#152); patch
  taken from upstream merge request.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  8 11:02:44 UTC 2022 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Add patch to fix alsa device creation:
  * fix-alsa.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  5 15:13:07 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.11:
  * Changes
    - The libcamera monitor is now enabled by default, so if the
      libcamera source is enabled in PipeWire, cameras discovered
      with the libcamera API will be  available out of the box.
      This is safe to use alongside V4L2, as long as the user does
      not try to use the same camera over different APIs at the
      same time.
    - Libcamera and V4L2 nodes now get assigned a
      `priority.session` number; V4L2 nodes get a higher priority
      by default, so the default camera is going to be /dev/video0
      over V4L2, unless changed with `wpctl`.
    - Libcamera nodes now get a user-friendly description based on
      their location (e.g. built-in front camera). Additionally,
      V4L2 nodes now have a "(V4L2)" string appended to their
      description in order to be distinguished from the libcamera
      ones.
    - 50-alsa-config.lua now has a section where you can set
      properties that will only be applied if WirePlumber is
      running in a virtual machine. By default it now sets
      `api.alsa.period-size = 256` and `api.alsa.headroom = 8192`.
  * Fixes
    - The "enabled" properties in the config files are now "true"
      by default when they are not defined. This fixes backwards
      compatibility with older configuration files.
    - Fixed device name deduplication in the alsa monitor, when
      device reservation is enabled.
    - Reverted a previous fix that makes it possible again to get
      a glitch when changing default nodes while also changing the
      profile (GNOME Settings).
      The fix was causing other problems and the issue will be
      addressed differently in the future.
    - Fixed an issue that would prevent applications from being
      moved to a recently plugged USB headset.
    - Fixed an issue where wireplumber would automatically link
      control ports, if they are enabled, to audio ports,
      effectively breaking audio.
    - The policy now always considers the profile of a device that
      was previously selected by the user, if it is available, when
      deciding which profile to activate.
    - A few documentation fixes.
  * Tools
    - wpctl now has a `get-volume` command for easier scripting of
      volume controls.
    - wpctl now supports relative steps and percentage-based steps
      in `set-volume`.
    - wpctl now also prints link states.
    - wpctl can now `inspect` metadata objects without showing
      critical warnings.
  * Library
    - A new WpDBus API was added to maintain a single D-Bus
      connection among modules that need one.
    - WpCore now has a method to get the virtual machine type, if
      WirePlumber is running in a virtual machine.
    - WpSpaDevice now has a
      `wp_spa_device_new_managed_object_iterator()` method.
    - WpSpaJson now has a `wp_spa_json_to_string()` method that
      returns a newly allocated string with the correct size of the string token.
    - WpLink now has a `WP_LINK_FEATURE_ESTABLISHED` that allows
      the caller to wait until the link is in the PAUSED or ACTIVE
      state. This transparently now enables watching links for
      negotiation or allocation errors and failing gracefully
      instead of keeping dead link objects around.
  * Misc
    - The Lua subproject was bumped to version 5.4.4.
- Rebase reduce-meson-required-version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 10 14:39:24 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.10:
  * Changes
    - Add i18n support to be able to translate some user-visible
      strings.
    - wpctl now supports using
      @DEFAULT_{AUDIO_,VIDEO_,}{SINK,SOURCE}@ as ID, almost like
      pactl. Additionally, it supports a --pid flag for changing
      volume and mute state by specifying a process ID, applying
      the state to all nodes of a specific client process.
    - The Lua engine now supports loading Lua libraries. These can
      be placed either in the standard Lua libraries path or in
      the "lib" subdirectory of WirePlumber's "scripts" directory
      and can be loaded with ``require()``
    - The Lua engine's sandbox has been relaxed to allow more
      functionality in scripts (the debug & coroutine libraries
      and some other previously disabled functions)
    - Lua scripts are now wrapped in special WpPlugin objects,
      allowing them to load asynchronously and declare when they
      have finished their loading
    - Add a new script that provides the same functionality as
      module-fallback-sink from PipeWire, but also takes endpoints
      into account and can be customised more easily. Disabled by
      default for now to avoid conflicts.
  * Policy
    - Add an optional experimental feature that allows filter-like
      streams (like echo-cancel or filter-node) to match the
      channel layout of the device they connect to, on both sides
      of the filter; that means that if, for instance, a sink has
      6 channels and the echo-cancel's source stream is linked to
      that sink, then the virtual sink presented by echo-cancel
      will also be configured to the same 6 channels layout. This
      feature needs to be explicitly enabled in the configuration
      ("filter.forward-format")
    - filter-like streams (filter-chain and such) no longer follow
      the default sink when it changes, like in PulseAudio.
  * Fixes
    - The suspend-node script now also suspends nodes that go into
      the "error" state, allowing them to recover from errors
      without having to restart WirePlumber.
    - Fix a crash in mixer-api when setting volume with
      channelVolumes.
    - logind module now watches only for user state changes,
      avoiding errors when machined is not running.
  * Misc
    - The configuration files now have comments mentioning which
      options need to be disabled in order to run WirePlumber
      without D-Bus.
    - The configuration files now have properties to
      enable/disable the monitors and other sections, so that it
      is possible to disable them by dropping in a file that just
      sets the relevant property to false.
    - setlocale() is now called directly instead of relying on
      pw_init().
    - WpSpaJson received some fixes and is now used internally to
      parse configuration files.
    - More applications were added to the bluetooth auto-switch
      applications whitelist.
- Add a new wireplumber-lang package.
- Drop patches already upstream:
  * 0001-scripts-policy-device-profile-clear-tables-when-devices-removed.patch
  * 0001-src-setlocale-in-main-for-tools-and-the-daemon.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 25 07:47:09 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Make the wireplumber-audio noarch as it just contains a lua
  config file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 18:36:13 UTC 2022 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.4.9:
  * Fixes:
    - restore-stream no longer crashes if properties for it are not
      present in the config (#190)
    - spa-json no longer crashes on non-x86 architectures
    - Fixed a potential crash in the bluetooth auto-switch module
      (#193)
    - Fixed a race condition that would cause Zoom desktop audio
      sharing to fail (#197)
    - Surround sound in some games is now exposed properly
      (pipewire#876)
    - Fixed a race condition that would cause the default source &
      sink to not be set at startup
    - policy-node now supports the 'target.object' key on streams
      and metadata
    - Multiple fixes in policy-node that make the logic in some
      cases behave more like PulseAudio (regarding nodes with the
      dont-reconnect property and regarding following the default
      source/sink)
    - Fixed a bug with parsing unquoted strings in spa-json
  * Misc:
    - The policy now supports configuring "persistent" device
      profiles. If a device is manually set to one of these
      profiles, then it will not be auto-switched to another
      profile automatically under any circumstances (#138, #204)
    - The device-activation module was re-written in lua
    - Brave, Edge, Vivaldi and Telegram were added in the bluetooth
      auto-switch applications list
    - ALSA nodes now use the PCM name to populate node.nick, which
      is useful at least on HDA cards using UCM, where all outputs
      (analog, hdmi, etc) are exposesd as nodes on a single profile
    - An icon name is now set on the properties of bluetooth devices
- Drop patches already upstream:

  * 0001-restore-stream-do-not-crash-if-config_properties-is-nil.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  7 17:31:11 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  * Highlights:
    - Added bluetooth profile auto-switching support. Bluetooth
      headsets will now automatically switch to the HSP/HFP profile
      when making a call and go back to the A2DP profile after the
      call ends (#90)
    - Added an option (enabled by default) to auto-switch to
      echo-cancel virtual device nodes when the echo-cancel module
      is loaded in pipewire-pulse, if there is no other configured
      default node
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed a regression that prevented nodes from being selected
      as default when using the pro-audio profile (#163)
    - Fixed a regression that caused encoded audio streams to stall
      (#178)
    - Fixed restoring bluetooth device profiles
  * Library:
    - A new WpSpaJson API was added as a front-end to spa-json.
      This is also exposed to Lua, so that Lua scripts can natively
      parse and write data in the spa-json format
  * Misc:
    - wpctl can now list the configured default sources and sinks
      and has a new command that allows clearing those configured
      defaults, so that wireplumber goes back to choosing the
      default nodes based on node priorities
    - The restore-stream script now has its own configuration file
      in main.lua.d/40-stream-defaults.lua and has independent
      options for restoring properties and target nodes
    - The restore-stream script now supports rule-based
      configuration to disable restoring volume properties and/or
      target nodes for specific streams, useful for applications
      that misbehave when we restore those (see #169)
    - policy-endpoint now assigns the "Default" role to any stream
      that does not have a role, so that it can be linked to a
      pre-configured endpoint
    - The route-settings-api module was dropped in favor of dealing
      with json natively in Lua, now that the API exists
- Drop patch which is already upstream:
  * 0001-default-nodes-handle-nodes-without-Routes.patch
- Update split-config-file.py script

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 31 17:45:11 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Use the default lua instead of hardcoding 5.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 25 15:08:59 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the selection of the
    default audio sources and sinks to be delayed until some event,
    which effectively caused losing audio output in many
    circumstances (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#148,
    glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#150, glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#151,
    glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#153)
  * Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the echo-cancellation
    pipewire module (and possibly others) to not work
  * A default sink or source is now not selected if there is no
    available route for it (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#145)
  * Fixed an issue where some clients would wait for a bit while
    seeking (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#146)
  * Fixed audio capture in the endpoints-based policy
  * Fixed an issue that would cause certain lua scripts to error
    out with older configuration files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:48:27 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove many build dependencies which aren't really needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 16:54:56 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Use %autosetup, apply patches unconditionally
- Hard depend on wireplumber-audio if pipewire-pulseaudio is installed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 12:08:45 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Supplements: (pipewire-pulseaudio and wireplumber) so everyone
  having those two packages already installed automatically get
  wireplumber-audio pulled in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 10:08:43 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Quiet setup of sources, no need to see the package untared.
- Disable tests for ppc64 for now like we do for i586.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  3 18:12:42 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Split the configuration to separate the audio initialization
  to a new wireplumber-audio subpackage. This way, if that package
  is not installed, pipewire doesn't open the audio devices, thus
  not entering a race-condition with pulseaudio but still allowing
  to manage v4l2 devices and sharing the screen in wayland, for
  example (boo#1188516).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 16:09:52 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patches from upstream to fix wireplumber breaking when
  udevadm trigger is run:
  * 0001-m-reserve-device-replace-the-hash-table-key-on-new-insert.patch
- And another patch to fix an issue where there is only 1 sink
  available and the card profile is toggeled between pro and
  stereo:
  * 0002-policy-node-wait-for-nodes-when-we-become-unlinked.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 11 13:25:33 UTC 2021 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.4.5:
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed a crash that could happen after a node linking error
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#76)
    - Fixed a bug that would cause capture streams to link to
      monitor ports of loopback nodes instead of linking to their
      capture ports
    - Fixed a needless wait that would happen on applications using
      the pipewire ALSA plugin (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#92)
    - Fixed an issue that would cause endless rescan loops in
      policy-node and could potentially also cause other strange
      behaviors in case pavucontrol or another monitoring utility
      was open while the policy was rescanning
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#77)
    - Fixed the endpoints-based policy that broke in recent
      versions and improved its codebase to share more code and be
      more in-line with policy-node
    - The semicolon character is now escaped properly in state
      files (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#82)
    - When a player requests encoded audio passthrough, the policy
      now prefers linking to a device that supports that instead of
      trying to link to the default device and potentially failing
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#75)
    - Miscellaneous robustness fixes in policy-node
  * API:
    - Added WpFactory, a binding for pw_factory proxies. This
      allows object managers to query factories that are loaded in
      the pipewire daemon
    - The file-monitor-api plugin can now watch files for changes
      in addition to directories

- Remove patches already included by upstream:
  * 0001-si-standard-link-fix-crash-after-returning-a-link-error.patch
  * 0002-policy-node-enforce-the-direction-of-the-target-when-linking-by-node-name.patch
  * 0001-add-missing-break-in-best-route-selection-logic.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  3 08:34:01 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

  route:
  * 0001-add-missing-break-in-best-route-selection-logic.patch

- Add patch to let wireplumber build in Leap 15.3/SLE-15-SP3
  which only have meson 0.54:
  * reduce-meson-required-version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 10:15:34 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %post/%pre/... sections to enable the user service
  automatically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 19 10:59:25 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

  of monitor ports:
  * 0002-policy-node-enforce-the-direction-of-the-target-when-linking-by-node-name.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 19 07:25:22 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix a crash when there's a link error
  (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#76):
  * 0001-si-standard-link-fix-crash-after-returning-a-link-error.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 15 15:55:46 UTC 2021 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  * Highlights:
    - Implemented linking nodes in passthrough mode, which enables
      encoded iec958 / dsd audio passthrough
    - Streams are now sent an error if it was not possible to link
      them to a target (#63)
    - When linking nodes where at least one of them has an
      unpositioned channel layout, the other one is not
      reconfigured to match the channel layout; it is instead
      linked with a best effort port matching logic
    - Output route switches automatically to the latest one that
      has become available (#69)
    - Policy now respects the 'node.exclusive' and 'node.passive'
      properties
    - Many other minor policy fixes for a smoother desktop usage
      experience
  * API:
    - Fixed an issue with the LocalModule() constructor not
      accepting nil as well as the properties table properly
    - Added WpClient.send_error(), WpSpaPod.fixate() and
    - WpSpaPod.filter() (both in C and Lua)
  * Misc:
    - Bumped meson version requirement to 0.56 to be able to use
      meson.project_{source,build}_root() and ease integration with
      pipewire's build system as a subproject
    - wireplumber.service is now an alias to
      pipewire-session-manager.service
    - Loading the logind module no longer fails if it was not found
      on the system; there is only a message printed in the output
    - The logind module can now be compiled with elogind (#71)
    - Improvements in wp-uninstalled.sh, mostly to ease its
      integration with pipewire's build system when wireplumber is
      build as a subproject
    - The format of audio nodes is now selected using the same
      algorithm as in media-session
    - Fixed a nasty segfault that appeared in 0.4.3 due to a typo
      (#72)
    - Fixed a re-entrancy issue in the wplua runtime (#73)

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  * Fixes:
    - Implemented logind integration to start the bluez monitor
      only on the WirePlumber instance that is running on the
      active seat; this fixes a bunch of startup warnings and the
      disappearance of HSP/HFP nodes after login (#54)
    - WirePlumber is now launched with GIO_USE_VFS=local to avoid
      strange D-Bus interference when the user session is
      restarted, which previously resulted in WirePlumber being
      terminated with SIGTERM and never recovering (#48)
    - WirePlumber now survives a restart of the D-Bus service,
      reconnecting to the bus and reclaiming the bus services that
      it needs (#55)
    - Implemented route-settings metadata, which fixes storing
      volume for the "System Sounds" in GNOME (#51)
    - Monitor sources can now be selected as the default source
     (#60)
    - Refactored some policy logic to allow linking to monitors;
      the policy now also respects "stream.capture.sink" property
      of streams which declares that the stream wants to be linked
      to a monitor (#66)
    - Policy now cleans up 'target.node' metadata so that streams
      get to follow the default source/sink again after the default
      was changed to match the stream's currently configured target
      (#65)
    - Fixed configuring virtual sources (#57)
    - Device monitors now do not crash if a SPA plugin is missing;
      instead, they print a warning to help users identify what
      they need to install (!214)
    - Fixed certain "proxy activation failed" warnings (#44)
    - iec958 codec configuration is now saved and restored properly
      (!228)
    - Fixed some logging issues with the latest version of pipewire
      (!227, !232)
    - Policy now respects the "node.link-group" property, which
      fixes issues with filter-chain and other virtual sources &
      sinks (#47)
    - Access policy now grants full permissions to flatpak
      "Manager" apps (#59)
  * Policy:
    - Added support for 'no-dsp' mode, which allows streaming audio
      using the format of the device instead of the standard float
      32-bit planar format (!225)
  * Library:
    - WpImplMetadata is now implemented using pw_impl_metadata
      instead of using its own implementation (#52)
    - Added support for custom object property IDs in WpSpaPod
      (#53)
  * Misc:
    - Added a script to load the libcamera monitor (!231)
    - Added option to disable building unit tests (!209)
    - WirePlumber will now fail to start with a warning if
      pipewire-media-session is also running in the system (#56)
    - The bluez monitor configuration was updated to match the
      latest one in pipewire-media-session (!224)

- Update to version 0.4.2:
  * Highlights:
    - Requires PipeWire 0.3.32 or later at runtime
    - Configuration files are now installed in
      $PREFIX/share/wireplumber, along with scripts, following the
      paradigm of PipeWire
    - State files are now stored in $XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
    - Added new file-monitor-api module, which allows Lua scripts
      to watch the filesystem for changes, using inotify
    - Added monitor for MIDI devices
    - Added a system-lua-version meson option that allows
      distributors to choose which Lua version to build against
      (auto, 5.3 or 5.4)
    - wpipc has been removed and split out to a separate project,
      https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/pipewire-ic-ipc/
  * Library:
    - A new WpImplModule class has been added; this allows loading
      a PipeWire module in the WirePlumber process space, keeping a
      handle that can be used to unload that module later. This is
      useful for loading filters, network sources/sinks, etc...
    - State files can now store keys that contain certain
      GKeyFile-reserved characters, such as [, ], = and space; this
      fixes storing stream volume state for streams using
      PipeWire's ALSA compatibility PCM plugin
    - WpProperties now uses a boxed WpPropertiesItem type in its
      iterators so that these iterators can be used with g-i
      bindings
    - Added API to lookup configuration and script files from
      multiple places in the filesystem
  * Lua:
    - A LocalModule API has been added to reflect the functionality
      offered by WpImplModule in C
    - The Node API now has a complete set of methods to reflect the
      methods of WpNode
    - Added Port.get_direction()
    - Added not-equals to the possible constraint verbs
    - Debug.dump_table now sorts keys before printing the table
  * Misc:
    - Tests no longer accidentally create files in $HOME; all
      transient files that are used for testing are now created
      in the build directory, except for sockets which are created
      in /tmp due to the 108-character limitation in socket paths
    - Tests that require optional SPA plugins are now skipped if
      those SPA plugins are not installed
    - Added a nice summary output at the end of meson configuration
    - Documented the Lua ObjectManager / Interest / Constraint APIs
    - Fixed some memory leaks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 14 14:57:37 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove the Conflicts: pipewire-session-manager. There's no
  problem in having both installed at the same time, they just
  can't run at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 14 06:25:10 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add `Provides: pipewire-session-manager` so wireplumber is
  recognized as a pipewire session manager implementation.
- Add `Conflicts: pipewire-session-manager` so no other session
  manager is installed at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 06:23:39 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * Highlights:
    + WirePlumber now supports Lua 5.4. You may compile it either
      with Lua 5.3 or 5.4, without any changes in behavior. The
      internal Lua subproject has also been upgraded to Lua 5.4, so
      any builds with -Dsystem-lua=false will use Lua 5.4 by
      default
  * Fixes:
    + Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with
      PipeWire 0.3.31
    + Fixed a potential livelock condition in
      si-audio-adapter/endpoint where the code would wait forever
      for a node's ports to appear in the graph
    + Fixed granting access to camera device nodes in flatpak
      clients connecting through the camera portal
    + Fixed a lot of issues found by the coverity static analyzer
    + Fixed certain race conditions in the wpipc library
    + Fixed compilation with GCC older than v8.1
  * Scripts:
    + Added a policy script that matches nodes to specific devices
      based on the "media.role" of the nodes and the
      "device.intended-roles" of the devices
  * Build system:
    + Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already
      using 2.62 API
    + Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire
      subproject
    + Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
    + The CI now also verifies that the build works on
      Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and tries multiple builds with different
      build options
