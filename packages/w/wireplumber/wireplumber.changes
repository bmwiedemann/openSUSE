Mon Jan 31 17:45:11 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Use the default lua instead of hardcoding 5.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 25 15:08:59 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.7:
  * Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the selection of the
    default audio sources and sinks to be delayed until some event,
    which effectively caused losing audio output in many
    circumstances (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#148,
    glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#150, glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#151,
    glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#153)
  * Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the echo-cancellation
    pipewire module (and possibly others) to not work
  * A default sink or source is now not selected if there is no
    available route for it (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#145)
  * Fixed an issue where some clients would wait for a bit while
    seeking (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#146)
  * Fixed audio capture in the endpoints-based policy
  * Fixed an issue that would cause certain lua scripts to error
    out with older configuration files
    (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#158)
- Drop patches already included upstream:
  * 0001-policy-node-schedule-rescan-without-timeout-if-defined-target-is-not-found.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 10 09:50:15 UTC 2022 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Reformat .changes file to limit lines to 67 chars when possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  8 16:12:57 UTC 2022 - Alexei Sorokin <sor.alexei@meowr.ru>

- Update to version 0.4.6:
  * Fix a lot of race condition bugs that would cause strange
    crashes or many log messages being printed when streaming
    clients would connect and disconnect very fast.
  * Improve the logic for selecting a default target device.
  * Fix switching to headphones when the wired headphones are
    plugged in.
  * Fix an issue where "udevadm trigger" would break wireplumber.
  * Fix an issue where switching profiles of a device could kill
    client nodes.
  * Fix briefly switching output to a secondary device when
    switching device profiles (#85)
  * Fix "wpctl status" showing default device selections when
    dealing with module-loopback virtual sinks and sources.
  * WirePlumber now ignores hidden files from the config directory.
  * Fix an interoperability issue with jackdbus.
  * Fix an issue where pulseaudio tcp clients would not have
    permissions to connect to PipeWire.
  * Fix a crash in the journald logger with NULL debug messages.
  * Enable real-time priority for the bluetooth nodes to run in RT.
  * Make the default stream volume configurable.
  * Scripts are now also looked up in
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireplumber/scripts
  * Update documentation on configuring WirePlumber and fixed some
    more documentation issues.
  * Add support for using strings as log level selectors in
    WIREPLUMBER_DEBUG.
- Drop patches merged upstream:
  * 0001-m-reserve-device-replace-the-hash-table-key-on-new-insert.patch
  * 0002-policy-node-wait-for-nodes-when-we-become-unlinked.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix a pulse client hanging issue:
  * 0001-policy-node-schedule-rescan-without-timeout-if-defined-target-is-not-found.patch
- Add patch from upstream to fix an issue with
  libpipewire-module-echo-cancel:
  * 0002-policy-node-find-best-linkable-if-default-one-cannot-be-linked.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 15 13:48:27 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove many build dependencies which aren't really needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 11 16:54:56 UTC 2021 - Fabian Vogt <fabian@ritter-vogt.de>

- Use %autosetup, apply patches unconditionally
- Hard depend on wireplumber-audio if pipewire-pulseaudio is installed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 12:08:45 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Supplements: (pipewire-pulseaudio and wireplumber) so everyone
  having those two packages already installed automatically get
  wireplumber-audio pulled in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  9 10:08:43 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Quiet setup of sources, no need to see the package untared.
- Disable tests for ppc64 for now like we do for i586.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  3 18:12:42 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Split the configuration to separate the audio initialization
  to a new wireplumber-audio subpackage. This way, if that package
  is not installed, pipewire doesn't open the audio devices, thus
  not entering a race-condition with pulseaudio but still allowing
  to manage v4l2 devices and sharing the screen in wayland, for
  example (boo#1188516).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 24 16:09:52 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patches from upstream to fix wireplumber breaking when
  udevadm trigger is run:
  * 0001-m-reserve-device-replace-the-hash-table-key-on-new-insert.patch
- And another patch to fix an issue where there is only 1 sink
  available and the card profile is toggeled between pro and
  stereo:
  * 0002-policy-node-wait-for-nodes-when-we-become-unlinked.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 11 13:25:33 UTC 2021 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.4.5:
  * Fixes:
    - Fixed a crash that could happen after a node linking error
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#76)
    - Fixed a bug that would cause capture streams to link to
      monitor ports of loopback nodes instead of linking to their
      capture ports
    - Fixed a needless wait that would happen on applications using
      the pipewire ALSA plugin (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#92)
    - Fixed an issue that would cause endless rescan loops in
      policy-node and could potentially also cause other strange
      behaviors in case pavucontrol or another monitoring utility
      was open while the policy was rescanning
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#77)
    - Fixed the endpoints-based policy that broke in recent
      versions and improved its codebase to share more code and be
      more in-line with policy-node
    - The semicolon character is now escaped properly in state
      files (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#82)
    - When a player requests encoded audio passthrough, the policy
      now prefers linking to a device that supports that instead of
      trying to link to the default device and potentially failing
      (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#75)
    - Miscellaneous robustness fixes in policy-node
  * API:
    - Added WpFactory, a binding for pw_factory proxies. This
      allows object managers to query factories that are loaded in
      the pipewire daemon
    - The file-monitor-api plugin can now watch files for changes
      in addition to directories

- Remove patches already included by upstream:
  * 0001-si-standard-link-fix-crash-after-returning-a-link-error.patch
  * 0002-policy-node-enforce-the-direction-of-the-target-when-linking-by-node-name.patch
  * 0001-add-missing-break-in-best-route-selection-logic.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  3 08:34:01 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix a problem saving the default
  route:
  * 0001-add-missing-break-in-best-route-selection-logic.patch

- Add patch to let wireplumber build in Leap 15.3/SLE-15-SP3
  which only have meson 0.54:
  * reduce-meson-required-version.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 21 10:15:34 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add %post/%pre/... sections to enable the user service
  automatically

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 19 10:59:25 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix selection of capture ports instead
  of monitor ports:
  * 0002-policy-node-enforce-the-direction-of-the-target-when-linking-by-node-name.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 19 07:25:22 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add patch from upstream to fix a crash when there's a link error
  (glfo#pipewire/wireplumber#76):
  * 0001-si-standard-link-fix-crash-after-returning-a-link-error.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 15 15:55:46 UTC 2021 - alarrosa@suse.com

- Update to version 0.4.4:
  * Highlights:
    - Implemented linking nodes in passthrough mode, which enables
      encoded iec958 / dsd audio passthrough
    - Streams are now sent an error if it was not possible to link
      them to a target (#63)
    - When linking nodes where at least one of them has an
      unpositioned channel layout, the other one is not
      reconfigured to match the channel layout; it is instead
      linked with a best effort port matching logic
    - Output route switches automatically to the latest one that
      has become available (#69)
    - Policy now respects the 'node.exclusive' and 'node.passive'
      properties
    - Many other minor policy fixes for a smoother desktop usage
      experience
  * API:
    - Fixed an issue with the LocalModule() constructor not
      accepting nil as well as the properties table properly
    - Added WpClient.send_error(), WpSpaPod.fixate() and
    - WpSpaPod.filter() (both in C and Lua)
  * Misc:
    - Bumped meson version requirement to 0.56 to be able to use
      meson.project_{source,build}_root() and ease integration with
      pipewire's build system as a subproject
    - wireplumber.service is now an alias to
      pipewire-session-manager.service
    - Loading the logind module no longer fails if it was not found
      on the system; there is only a message printed in the output
    - The logind module can now be compiled with elogind (#71)
    - Improvements in wp-uninstalled.sh, mostly to ease its
      integration with pipewire's build system when wireplumber is
      build as a subproject
    - The format of audio nodes is now selected using the same
      algorithm as in media-session
    - Fixed a nasty segfault that appeared in 0.4.3 due to a typo
      (#72)
    - Fixed a re-entrancy issue in the wplua runtime (#73)

- Update to version 0.4.3:
  * Fixes:
    - Implemented logind integration to start the bluez monitor
      only on the WirePlumber instance that is running on the
      active seat; this fixes a bunch of startup warnings and the
      disappearance of HSP/HFP nodes after login (#54)
    - WirePlumber is now launched with GIO_USE_VFS=local to avoid
      strange D-Bus interference when the user session is
      restarted, which previously resulted in WirePlumber being
      terminated with SIGTERM and never recovering (#48)
    - WirePlumber now survives a restart of the D-Bus service,
      reconnecting to the bus and reclaiming the bus services that
      it needs (#55)
    - Implemented route-settings metadata, which fixes storing
      volume for the "System Sounds" in GNOME (#51)
    - Monitor sources can now be selected as the default source
     (#60)
    - Refactored some policy logic to allow linking to monitors;
      the policy now also respects "stream.capture.sink" property
      of streams which declares that the stream wants to be linked
      to a monitor (#66)
    - Policy now cleans up 'target.node' metadata so that streams
      get to follow the default source/sink again after the default
      was changed to match the stream's currently configured target
      (#65)
    - Fixed configuring virtual sources (#57)
    - Device monitors now do not crash if a SPA plugin is missing;
      instead, they print a warning to help users identify what
      they need to install (!214)
    - Fixed certain "proxy activation failed" warnings (#44)
    - iec958 codec configuration is now saved and restored properly
      (!228)
    - Fixed some logging issues with the latest version of pipewire
      (!227, !232)
    - Policy now respects the "node.link-group" property, which
      fixes issues with filter-chain and other virtual sources &
      sinks (#47)
    - Access policy now grants full permissions to flatpak
      "Manager" apps (#59)
  * Policy:
    - Added support for 'no-dsp' mode, which allows streaming audio
      using the format of the device instead of the standard float
      32-bit planar format (!225)
  * Library:
    - WpImplMetadata is now implemented using pw_impl_metadata
      instead of using its own implementation (#52)
    - Added support for custom object property IDs in WpSpaPod
      (#53)
  * Misc:
    - Added a script to load the libcamera monitor (!231)
    - Added option to disable building unit tests (!209)
    - WirePlumber will now fail to start with a warning if
      pipewire-media-session is also running in the system (#56)
    - The bluez monitor configuration was updated to match the
      latest one in pipewire-media-session (!224)

- Update to version 0.4.2:
  * Highlights:
    - Requires PipeWire 0.3.32 or later at runtime
    - Configuration files are now installed in
      $PREFIX/share/wireplumber, along with scripts, following the
      paradigm of PipeWire
    - State files are now stored in $XDG_STATE_HOME instead of
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
    - Added new file-monitor-api module, which allows Lua scripts
      to watch the filesystem for changes, using inotify
    - Added monitor for MIDI devices
    - Added a system-lua-version meson option that allows
      distributors to choose which Lua version to build against
      (auto, 5.3 or 5.4)
    - wpipc has been removed and split out to a separate project,
      https://git.automotivelinux.org/src/pipewire-ic-ipc/
  * Library:
    - A new WpImplModule class has been added; this allows loading
      a PipeWire module in the WirePlumber process space, keeping a
      handle that can be used to unload that module later. This is
      useful for loading filters, network sources/sinks, etc...
    - State files can now store keys that contain certain
      GKeyFile-reserved characters, such as [, ], = and space; this
      fixes storing stream volume state for streams using
      PipeWire's ALSA compatibility PCM plugin
    - WpProperties now uses a boxed WpPropertiesItem type in its
      iterators so that these iterators can be used with g-i
      bindings
    - Added API to lookup configuration and script files from
      multiple places in the filesystem
  * Lua:
    - A LocalModule API has been added to reflect the functionality
      offered by WpImplModule in C
    - The Node API now has a complete set of methods to reflect the
      methods of WpNode
    - Added Port.get_direction()
    - Added not-equals to the possible constraint verbs
    - Debug.dump_table now sorts keys before printing the table
  * Misc:
    - Tests no longer accidentally create files in $HOME; all
      transient files that are used for testing are now created
      in the build directory, except for sockets which are created
      in /tmp due to the 108-character limitation in socket paths
    - Tests that require optional SPA plugins are now skipped if
      those SPA plugins are not installed
    - Added a nice summary output at the end of meson configuration
    - Documented the Lua ObjectManager / Interest / Constraint APIs
    - Fixed some memory leaks

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 14 14:57:37 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Remove the Conflicts: pipewire-session-manager. There's no
  problem in having both installed at the same time, they just
  can't run at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 14 06:25:10 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Add `Provides: pipewire-session-manager` so wireplumber is
  recognized as a pipewire session manager implementation.
- Add `Conflicts: pipewire-session-manager` so no other session
  manager is installed at the same time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 13 06:23:39 UTC 2021 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.4.1:
  * Highlights:
    + WirePlumber now supports Lua 5.4. You may compile it either
      with Lua 5.3 or 5.4, without any changes in behavior. The
      internal Lua subproject has also been upgraded to Lua 5.4, so
      any builds with -Dsystem-lua=false will use Lua 5.4 by
      default
  * Fixes:
    + Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with
      PipeWire 0.3.31
    + Fixed a potential livelock condition in
      si-audio-adapter/endpoint where the code would wait forever
      for a node's ports to appear in the graph
    + Fixed granting access to camera device nodes in flatpak
      clients connecting through the camera portal
    + Fixed a lot of issues found by the coverity static analyzer
    + Fixed certain race conditions in the wpipc library
    + Fixed compilation with GCC older than v8.1
  * Scripts:
    + Added a policy script that matches nodes to specific devices
      based on the "media.role" of the nodes and the
      "device.intended-roles" of the devices
  * Build system:
    + Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already
      using 2.62 API
    + Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire
      subproject
    + Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
    + The CI now also verifies that the build works on
      Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and tries multiple builds with different
      build options

-------------------------------------------------------------------
