%description
This tool seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working with rust- generated WebAssembly that
you would like to interop with JavaScript, in the browser or with Node.js. wasm-pack helps you build
rust-generated WebAssembly packages that you could publish to the npm registry, or otherwise use
alongside any javascript packages in workflows that you already use, such as webpack.
