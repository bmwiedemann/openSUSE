  <title>Waffle</title>
  <description>Waffle is a cross-platform C library that allows one to defer selection of GL API and window system until runtime. For example, on Linux, Waffle enables an application to select X11/EGL with an OpenGL 3.3 core profile, Wayland with OpenGL ES2, and other window system / API combinations.

Waffle's immediate goal is to enable Piglit, Mesa's OpenGL test suite, to test multiple GL flavors in a cross-platform way. However, Waffle's design does not preclude it from being useful to other projects.</description>
