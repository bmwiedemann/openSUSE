  <title>A simple wrapper around curl to easily download files</title>
  <description>A simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download files
without having to remember any parameters.
Simply call wcurl with a list of URLs you want to download and
wcurl will pick sane defaults.

If you need anything more complex, you can provide any of curl's
supported parameters via the --curl-options option. Just beware
that you likely should be using curl directly if your use case is
not covered.

By default, wcurl will:
 * Encode whitespaces in URLs.
 * Download multiple URLs in parallel if the installed curl's
   version is &gt;= 7.66.0
 * Follow redirects.
 * Automatically choose a filename as output
 * Avoid overwriting files if the installed curl's version
   is &gt;= 7.83.0 (--no-clobber).
 * Perform retries.
 * Set the downloaded file timestamp to the value provided by the
   server, if available.
 * Disable curl's URL globbing parser so {} and [] characters in
   URLs are not treated specially.</description>
