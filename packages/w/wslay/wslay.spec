%description
Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C. It implements the protocol version
13 described in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API: event-based API
and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it is suitable for
non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set callbacks in various events.
For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports
data transfer part of WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake
in HTTP.

Wslay supports:

Text/Binary messages.
Automatic ping reply.
Callback interface.
External event loop.

Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it offers
callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O frameworks, SSL,
sockets, etc. This makes Wslay portable across various platforms and the
application authors can choose freely I/O frameworks.
