- add libart-gcc10.patch: this fixes the build using gcc-10. There's not
  readily available upstream release with fixes yet (there are releases but
  the look automatic and don't contain generated autotools files).

- watchman_4.7.0_makefile-am.diff: dropped, included in tarball by now
- 0001-Replaced-memset-calls-with-appopriate-C-11-init-or-a.patch: fix invalid
  raw memory accesses of non-POD objects, fixes ppc build.
- 0002-Re-worked-replacement-of-memset-with-proper-init-to-.patch: fix
  compiler errors introduced by the above patch ...
- update to version 4.9.0:
  - Changes in 4.8.0:
    * New command `flush-subscriptions` to synchronize subscriptions associated
      with the current session.
    * Enforce socket Unix groups more strongly — Watchman will now refuse to start
      if it couldn't gain the right group memberships, as can happen for sites that
      are experiencing intermittent LDAP connectivity problems.
    * pywatchman now officially supports Python 3. pywatchman will return Unicode
      strings (possibly with surrogate escapes) by default, but can optionally return
      bytestrings. Note that on Python 3, pywatchman requires Watchman 4.8 and above.
      The Python 2 interface and requirements remain unchanged.
    * Prior to 4.8, methods on the Java WatchmanClient that returned
    	ListenableFutures would swallow exceptions and hang in an unfinished state
    	under situations like socket closure or thread death.  This has been fixed, and
    	now ListenableFutures propagate exception conditions immediately.  (Note that
    	this is typically unrecoverable, and users should create a new WatchmanClient
    	to re-establish communication with Watchman.)  See #412.
    * The minimum Java version for the Watchman Java client has always been 1.7,
    	but it was incorrectly described to be 1.6.  The Java client's build file has
    	been fixed accordingly.
    * Watchman was converted from C to C++.  The conversion exposed several
    	concurrency bugs, all of which have now been fixed.
    * Subscription queries are now executed in the context of the client thread,
    	which means that subscriptions are dispatched in parallel.  Previously,
    	subscriptions would be serially dispatched and block the disk IO thread.
    * Triggers are now dispatched in parallel and waits are managed in their own
    	threads (one thread per trigger).  This improves concurrency and resolves a
    	couple of waitpid related issues where watchman may not reap spawned children
    	in a timely fashion, or may spin on CPU until another child is spawned.
    * Fixed an object lifecycle management issue that could cause a crash when
      aging out old/transient files.
    * Implement an upgraded wire protocol, BSERv2, on the server and in pywatchman.
    	BSERv2 can carry information about string encoding over the wire. This lets
    	pywatchman convert to Unicode strings on Python 3. Clients and servers know how
    	to  transparently fall back to BSERv1.
  - Changes in 4.9.0:
    * New field: `content.sha1hex`.  This field expands to the SHA1 hash of
      the file contents, expressed in hex digits (40 character hex string).
      Watchman maintains a cache of the content hashes and can compute the
      hash on demand and also heuristically as files are changed.  This is
      useful for tooling that wants to perform more intelligent cache invalidation
      or build artifact fetching from content addressed storage.
    * Fixed an issue that resulted in the perf logging thread deadlocking when
      `perf_logger_command` is enabled in the global configuration
    * Fixed an issue where queries larger than 1MB would likely result in
      a PDU error response.
    * Reduced lock contention for subscriptions that do no use the advanced
      settling (`drop`, `defer`) options.
    * Fixed `since` generator behavior when using unix timestamps rather than
      the preferred clock string syntax
    * Improved the reporting of "new" files in watchman results
    * Improved performance of handling changes on case insensitive filesystems
    * pywatchman: the python wheel format is used for publishing watchman pypi package
    * pywatchman: now watchman path is configurable in python client
    * pywatchman: now python client can be used as a context manager
