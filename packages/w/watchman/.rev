    <comment>- watchman_4.7.0_makefile-am.diff: dropped, included in tarball by now
- 0001-Replaced-memset-calls-with-appopriate-C-11-init-or-a.patch: fix invalid
  raw memory accesses of non-POD objects, fixes ppc build.
- 0002-Re-worked-replacement-of-memset-with-proper-init-to-.patch: fix
  compiler errors introduced by the above patch ...
- update to version 4.9.0:
  - Changes in 4.8.0:
    * New command `flush-subscriptions` to synchronize subscriptions associated
      with the current session.
    * Enforce socket Unix groups more strongly â€” Watchman will now refuse to start
      if it couldn't gain the right group memberships, as can happen for sites that
      are experiencing intermittent LDAP connectivity problems.
    * pywatchman now officially supports Python 3. pywatchman will return Unicode
      strings (possibly with surrogate escapes) by default, but can optionally return
      bytestrings. Note that on Python 3, pywatchman requires Watchman 4.8 and above.
      The Python 2 interface and requirements remain unchanged.
    * Prior to 4.8, methods on the Java WatchmanClient that returned
    	ListenableFutures would swallow exceptions and hang in an unfinished state
    	under situations like socket closure or thread death.  This has been fixed, and
    	now ListenableFutures propagate exception conditions immediately.  (Note that
    	this is typically unrecoverable, and users should create a new WatchmanClient
    	to re-establish communication with Watchman.)  See #412.
    * The minimum Java version for the Watchman Java client has always been 1.7,
    	but it was incorrectly described to be 1.6.  The Java client's build file has
    	been fixed accordingly.
    * Watchman was converted from C to C++.  The conversion exposed several
    	concurrency bugs, all of which have now been fixed.
    * Subscription queries are now executed in the context of the client thread,
    	which means that subscriptions are dispatched in parallel.  Previously,
    	subscriptions would be serially dispatched and block the disk IO thread.</comment>
