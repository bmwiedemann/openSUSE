  <title>An MS Windows Emulator</title>
  <description>An MS Windows emulator, consisting of both runtime and source
compatibility functions. You can run your MS executables with it and
write your Windows programs under Linux and link against the WINE
libraries.

It is not necessary to have a Windows installation to run WINE.

Refer to /usr/share/doc/packages/wine/README.SuSE. There is more
documentation available in that directory. Read 'man wine' for further
information.

You can invoke wine by entering 'wine program.exe'. Configure it by
running 'winecfg'.</description>
