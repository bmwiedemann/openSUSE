    <comment>- update to v4.3.0rc2 with following major changes:
  * Provision interface is not tied to 'eth0' any more. The provision interface
    must be named 'default' now. The file `nodes.yaml' must be changed accordingly.
  * Creating of '/etc/exports' can now be disabled, so that wwctl configure -a
    wont overwrite a existing '/etc/exports'.
  * All configurations files for the host (/etc/exports, /etc/dhcpd.conf,
    /etc/hosts) are now populated from the
    (OVERLAYDIR/host/etc/{exports|dhcpd|hosts}.ww . Also other configuration
    files like prometheus.yml.ww or slurm.conf.ww which depend on the cluster
    nodes can be placed. Also the new templated functions {{ abort }}, 
    {{ IncludeBlock }} abd {{ no_backup }} are allowed now.
  * nodes and profiles can now have multiple system and runtime overlays, as a
    comma separated list.
  * The overlays of the profile and the nodes are combined.
  * Simple ipv6 support is now enabled. In warewulf.conf the option
    ipaddr6/Ipv6net must be set to enable ipv6. If enabled on of these options
    is set a node will get a derived ipv6 in the scheme ipv6net:ipaddr4. This
    address can also be overwritten for every node
  * Multiple files can now created from a single template.ww file with the {{ file FILENAME }}
    command in the template. The command is expanded to the magic template command
    {{ /* file FILENAME */}} which is picked up by wwctl and everything which comes after this
    magic comment will be written to the file FILENAME. This mechanism is leveraged in the
    configuration files for the network, see ifcfg.xml.ww and ifcgf.ww.
  * Networks can now have arbitrary keys value pairs in the profiles and on the node, so that
    things like bridges and mtu sizes can be set
  * The yaml format for nodes has now sub-keys for ipmi and kernel, old nodes.conf files have to
    to be changed accordingly
  * uids and gids of a container now get synced at import time, so that at least users with the
    same name have the same uid. This is not necessarily needed for warewulf, but services like
    munge.
  * backward compatibility for nodes.conf
  * added file:// uri for importing archived containers
- removed LocalStateDir-is-configureable-to-meet-FHS.patch as implemented upstream
