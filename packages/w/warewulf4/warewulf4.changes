- Provide an overlay package for the cluster-wide configuration
  of an RKE2 cluster. This allows to share the connection token
  across all node and sthe first server endpoint across all agents.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 22 06:53:46 UTC 2024 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 13:41:00 UTC 2024 - cgoll@suse.com

- Update to version 4.5.8:
- Warewulf v4.5.8 simplifies the `wwinit` boot process for SELinux
  and configures tmpfs to spread the node image across all
  available NUMA nodes. It also improves the detection of kernels
  in the container image to more reliably detect the newest
  available kernel and to avoid debug / rescue kernels.
- Warewulf v4.5.7 fixes the ability to override overlay files
  configured in profiles with overlays configured per-node; fixes
  a template processing bug bug in development-time overlay
  rendering; and improves the preview dracut-based boot process to
  better support a "secure" boot process.
- removed added-cow-option-to-bind.patch as now in upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 22 12:56:41 UTC 2024 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

  * `wwctl container list --kernel` shows the kernel detected for
    each container.
  *  `wwctl container list --size` shows the uncompressed size of
     each container. `--compressed` shows the compressed size, and
     `--chroot` shows the size of the container source on the server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 22 20:23:04 UTC 2024 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Allow to install dnsmasq as an alternative to dhcp-server.
- Set minimum UID value for user UIDs to 1000 (boo#1221886).
- Make dependencies warewulf package version dependent. This
  helps to keep the resolver to mix different packages from
  different versions.
- On upgrade from older versions move files from
  `/usr/share/warewulf/overlays/` to
  `/var/lib/warewulf/overlays/*/rootfs/`
  * Added: adjust_overlays.sh.

  * all overlays reside now under a `rootfs` diretory e.g.
    the host overlays reside now under
    `/var/lib/warewulf/host/rootfs`
    This has the advantage that the `rootfs` can be under a version
    control, without the effect that the meta files e.g. `.git` will
    show up in the rendered overlays.
- removed patches:
  * clean-warewulf-conf.patch
  * dnsmasq-template-move.patch
  * removed vendor.tar.gz


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 19 11:43:45 UTC 2024 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 14:48:08 UTC 2023 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to v4.5.0rc0 pre release with following new features:
  * disks, partitions and file systems can set in the configration
    and if ignition is present in the container, changes to the disks will be
    made
  * grub can be used as alternative boot method instead of iPXE. The
    grub binairy is extracted from the container and shim is executed before
    the grub. This enables secure boot
  * wwctl has now the genconfig subcommand which will print/create
    valid configurations
  * all paths e.g the overlay dir, can now be configured in warewulf.conf
- notable bug fixes are:
  * Fixed a bug where profile tags were erroneously overridden by empty node
    values.

  * all boolean options need now to have the form --option=true|false
    e.g. wwctl node set node01 --discoverable=true
  * wwctl show --render shows overlay templates as they would be
    rendered on a given target node

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan  5 16:08:19 UTC 2023 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- updated to version v4.4.0 with following changes:
  * Changed internal interacation between the on disk YAML format and the in memory
    format. This enables the command line options to be autogenerated from the datastructures.
    Also this keeps the options for profiles and node set/add commands in strict sync.
  * Added node edit/export/import where the edit command exposes the YAML config for the
    given nodes in an editor. Nodes can also be added with this command. The export command
    simply drops the YAML config for the given nodes. With the import command nodes can be
    imported as YAML or as a CSV file. The CSV file must havr a header in where the first field
    must always be the nodename, the rest of the fields are the same as the long commandline
    options. Network device must have the form net.$NETNAME.$NETOPTION, which would e.g. be
    net.default.ipaddr
  * The default value (like kernel args) are no read in from the configuration file
    defaults.conf. If this file couldn't be read built in default values will be used.
  * Template files for NetworkManager are now present in the wwinit overlay. A interface must
    have the type ethernet or infiniband that these will be brought up by NetworkManager
  * Listings of container via wwctl container list will now show the creation,modification
    date and the size.
  * Initial cut of the warewulf API.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 10 08:43:39 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- update to 4.3.0rc6 what should the final release candidate
  * using compressed images again, as PXE else would fail

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 14 13:18:23 UTC 2022 - Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>

- update to v4.3.0rc2 with following major changes:
  * Provision interface is not tied to 'eth0' any more. The provision interface
    must be named 'default' now. The file `nodes.yaml' must be changed accordingly.
  * Creating of '/etc/exports' can now be disabled, so that wwctl configure -a
    wont overwrite a existing '/etc/exports'.
  * All configurations files for the host (/etc/exports, /etc/dhcpd.conf,
    /etc/hosts) are now populated from the
    (OVERLAYDIR/host/etc/{exports|dhcpd|hosts}.ww . Also other configuration
    files like prometheus.yml.ww or slurm.conf.ww which depend on the cluster
    nodes can be placed. Also the new templated functions {{ abort }}, 
    {{ IncludeBlock }} abd {{ no_backup }} are allowed now.
  * nodes and profiles can now have multiple system and runtime overlays, as a
    comma separated list.
  * The overlays of the profile and the nodes are combined.
  * Simple ipv6 support is now enabled. In warewulf.conf the option
    ipaddr6/Ipv6net must be set to enable ipv6. If enabled on of these options
    is set a node will get a derived ipv6 in the scheme ipv6net:ipaddr4. This
    address can also be overwritten for every node
  * Multiple files can now created from a single template.ww file with the {{ file FILENAME }}
    command in the template. The command is expanded to the magic template command
    {{ /* file FILENAME */}} which is picked up by wwctl and everything which comes after this
    magic comment will be written to the file FILENAME. This mechanism is leveraged in the
    configuration files for the network, see ifcfg.xml.ww and ifcgf.ww.
  * Networks can now have arbitrary keys value pairs in the profiles and on the node, so that
    things like bridges and mtu sizes can be set
  * The yaml format for nodes has now sub-keys for ipmi and kernel, old nodes.conf files have to
    to be changed accordingly
  * uids and gids of a container now get synced at import time, so that at least users with the
    same name have the same uid. This is not necessarily needed for warewulf, but services like
    munge.
  * backward compatibility for nodes.conf
  * added file:// uri for importing archived containers
- removed LocalStateDir-is-configureable-to-meet-FHS.patch as implemented upstream
