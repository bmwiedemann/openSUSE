  <title>A Tool for Applying Patches with Conflicts</title>
  <description>Wiggle is a program for applying patches that 'patch' cannot apply due
to conflicting changes in the original.

Wiggle will always apply all changes in the patch to the original. If
it cannot find a way to cleanly apply a patch, it inserts it in the
original in a manner similar to 'merge,' and reports an unresolvable
conflict.</description>
