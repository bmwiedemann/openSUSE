    ellipsized too often.

- update to 1.15.10:
   * Fixed undefined behavior when servicing requests to downgrade add-ons.
   * The Rise of Wesnoth
     * Adjust campaign difficulty
   * The Delay Advancements modification has been removed in favor of adding
     the Plan Unit Advance modification to mainline. Enabling this modification
     allows each player to choose what their units will level up into in case
     the advancement happens on an enemy player's turn in an online multiplayer
     game.
   * Unit advancement that happens on an enemy's turn in online multiplayer games
     are no longer randomized. Instead, the first advancement listed for the unit is
     always used.
   * Disabled World Conquest due to an increasing number of reported bugs and
     it currently lacking a maintainer. It may be removed entirely in a future
     release.
   * Upgrade to Lua 5.4.2.

     contents of a lua table. This is intended as a debugging aid and nothing
     more.
   * Deprecation warnings can now be viewed in the in-game Lua console,
     together with a stack trace to the first location that triggered them.
   * There is now a --strict-lua command-line option that disables most
     deprecated Lua functions; this makes the use of deprecated APIs an error
     instead of a warning.
   * Updated translations
   * update footpad sprite
   * north-facing frames for dunefolk skirmisher, loyalist bowman, and troll whelp
   * Added a "disengaged" orb, shown instead of the partially-moved orb for
     units that can move but can't attack.
   * Added information about the build's (not runtime) target CPU architecture
     to the game version info dialog and --report.
   * Added terminal-style command history browsing with up-down keys for
     in-game consoles used by debug mode, ai and search floating textboxes.
   * Made the preferences dialog larger on HDPI screens; this fixes a usability
     issue with HDPI font sizes (issue #5185).
   * Extent 'special_id_active' and 'special_type_active' to abilities used
     like weapon and to [leadership] abilities.
   * abilities used like weapon can call [leading_anim] now.
   * Fixed display zoom not being taken into account when using the `x`, `y`,
     `directional_x` and `directional_y` attributes in unit animations.
   * Fixed a warning message and the AI leader potentially not moving when it
     cannot reach a keep because it's occupied by an allied unit

      circumstances.

- updated to bugfix release 0.8.11
  * Lots of bugs have been fixed in this release. One of them
    caused units to walk on the water and prevented the AI from
    being correctly configured in campaigns under certain locales.
    Other one allowed AI units to be merged, making them disappear.
  * Some units have been balanced, and there are new animations for
    mages.
  * As usual we have got translation updates and also a new
    translation, British English.
