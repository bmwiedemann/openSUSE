   * The Rise of Wesnoth
     * Adjust campaign difficulty
   * The Delay Advancements modification has been removed in favor of adding

     game.
   * Unit advancement that happens on an enemy's turn in online multiplayer games
     are no longer randomized. Instead, the first advancement listed for the unit is

     it currently lacking a maintainer. It may be removed entirely in a future
     release.
   * Upgrade to Lua 5.4.2.

   * Deprecation warnings can now be viewed in the in-game Lua console,
     together with a stack trace to the first location that triggered them.
   * There is now a --strict-lua command-line option that disables most
     deprecated Lua functions; this makes the use of deprecated APIs an error
     instead of a warning.
   * Updated translations
   * update footpad sprite
   * north-facing frames for dunefolk skirmisher, loyalist bowman, and troll whelp
   * Added a "disengaged" orb, shown instead of the partially-moved orb for
     units that can move but can't attack.
   * Added information about the build's (not runtime) target CPU architecture
     to the game version info dialog and --report.
   * Added terminal-style command history browsing with up-down keys for
     in-game consoles used by debug mode, ai and search floating textboxes.
   * Made the preferences dialog larger on HDPI screens; this fixes a usability
     issue with HDPI font sizes (issue #5185).
   * Extent 'special_id_active' and 'special_type_active' to abilities used
     like weapon and to [leadership] abilities.
   * abilities used like weapon can call [leading_anim] now.
   * Fixed display zoom not being taken into account when using the `x`, `y`,
     `directional_x` and `directional_y` attributes in unit animations.
   * Fixed a warning message and the AI leader potentially not moving when it
     cannot reach a keep because it's occupied by an allied unit
