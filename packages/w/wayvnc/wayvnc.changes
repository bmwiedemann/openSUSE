- update to 0.4.0:
  * PAM Authentication, thanks to Nicholas Sica.
  * Faking of modifiers to match keyboard symbols not found at the current shift
  * QEMU extended key event, which uses key codes instead of key symbols. This
    bypasses the need for reverse keyboard symbol mapping for clients that
    support the extension, so the server doesn't need to know about keyboard
    layouts.
  * Xkb config parameters have been added.

- Update to version 0.2.0
- New features:
  + The OpenGL ES 2.0 based renderer has now been replaced with a pixman based
    renderer. The new renderer is both simpler and performs better on devices
    with poor memory bandwidth such as the Raspberry Pi 3.
  + Extra damage checking is now done using a fash-hash (murmur3) based method,
    rather than comparing frames. This saves memory bandwidth.
  + Experimental support for GPU side wlr-screencopy (wlroots 0.11.0 is
    required).
  + dtrace probes have been added for latency measurements.
- Bugs fixed:
  + Output transformations are now in line with wlroots's output transformation
    behaviour.
  + Shared memory files are now allocated with the correct size rather than zero.
  + Keyboard modifiers no longer get stuck.
  + Wayvnc exits when the compositor goes away rather than crashing.
  + Wayvnc exits when the selected seat or output goes away rather than crashing.
- Default frame rate limit is now 30fps
