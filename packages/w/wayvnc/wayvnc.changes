- Prefixe include of wayland-client.h with directory name

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 10:20:20 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.2:
  * This fixes control commands that don't take any parameters

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 24 05:11:55 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.1:
  * Fix compatibility issues with FreeBSD and a few other systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 23 16:49:02 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.0:
  New wayvncctl:
  * The captured output can be changed on the fly
  * Connected clients can be listed and managed
  * Various events can be monitored
  Highlights:
  * Control interface, mentioned above.
  * Screen capturing is paused when no client is connected
  * Screen capturing is paused for outputs that are powered off
  * Horizontal scrolling
  * Each client now gets its own set of virtual inputs. This helps
    with state tracking.
  * Symbol to key code mapping now works better with xwayland

- Update to 0.5.0:
  * The most significant addition for this release is H.264 encoding
    via the Open H.264 RFB protocol extension. Clients that have
    implemented Open H.264 at this time are TigerVNC and wlvncc,
    of which only the latter uses hardware accelerated decoding.
    H.264 encoding is hardware accelerated and requires the --gpu
    command line flag to be enabled. It isn't particularly useful
    without hardware acceleration, so it's better to stick with
    "Tight" encoding if you don't have GPU rendering.
  * Input can now be disabled
  * UNIX Sockets
  * Screen-capturing via DMA-BUF is now a command line flag (--gpu)
  * Improved logging and error messages

Mon Jan 24 22:04:43 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.1:
  * main: Pin wl_output version to 3
  * screencopy: Set upper bounds on protocol version
  * main: Set upper bounds on pointer manager version 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 28 20:53:16 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.0:
  * PAM Authentication, thanks to Nicholas Sica.
  * Faking of modifiers to match keyboard symbols not found at the current shift
  * QEMU extended key event, which uses key codes instead of key symbols. This
    bypasses the need for reverse keyboard symbol mapping for clients that
    support the extension, so the server doesn't need to know about keyboard
    layouts.
  * Xkb config parameters have been added.

- Update to version 0.2.0
- New features:
  + The OpenGL ES 2.0 based renderer has now been replaced with a pixman based
    renderer. The new renderer is both simpler and performs better on devices
    with poor memory bandwidth such as the Raspberry Pi 3.
  + Extra damage checking is now done using a fash-hash (murmur3) based method,
    rather than comparing frames. This saves memory bandwidth.
  + Experimental support for GPU side wlr-screencopy (wlroots 0.11.0 is
    required).
  + dtrace probes have been added for latency measurements.
- Bugs fixed:
  + Output transformations are now in line with wlroots's output transformation
    behaviour.
  + Shared memory files are now allocated with the correct size rather than zero.
  + Keyboard modifiers no longer get stuck.
  + Wayvnc exits when the compositor goes away rather than crashing.
  + Wayvnc exits when the selected seat or output goes away rather than crashing.
- Default frame rate limit is now 30fps
