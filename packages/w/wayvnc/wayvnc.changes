- Update to version 0.2.0
- New features:
  + The OpenGL ES 2.0 based renderer has now been replaced with a pixman based
    renderer. The new renderer is both simpler and performs better on devices
    with poor memory bandwidth such as the Raspberry Pi 3.
  + Extra damage checking is now done using a fash-hash (murmur3) based method,
    rather than comparing frames. This saves memory bandwidth.
  + Experimental support for GPU side wlr-screencopy (wlroots 0.11.0 is
    required).
  + dtrace probes have been added for latency measurements.
- Bugs fixed:
  + Output transformations are now in line with wlroots's output transformation
    behaviour.
  + Shared memory files are now allocated with the correct size rather than zero.
  + Keyboard modifiers no longer get stuck.
  + Wayvnc exits when the compositor goes away rather than crashing.
  + Wayvnc exits when the selected seat or output goes away rather than crashing.
- Default frame rate limit is now 30fps
