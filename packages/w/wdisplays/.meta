  <description>wdisplays is a graphical application for configuring displays in Wayland compositors. It borrows some code from kanshi. It should work in any compositor that implements the wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 protocol. Compositors that are known to support the protocol are Sway and Wayfire. The goal of this project is to allow precise adjustment of display settings in kiosks, digital signage, and other elaborate multi-monitor setups.</description>
