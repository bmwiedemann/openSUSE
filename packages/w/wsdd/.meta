  <title>Web Service Discovery host Daemon</title>
  <description>
	  wsdd implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon. This enables (Samba) hosts,
	  like your local NAS device, to be found by Web Service Discovery Clients like
	  Windows.

	  Since NetBIOS discovery is not supported by Windows anymore, wsdd makes hosts
	  to appear in Windows again using the Web Service Discovery method. This is
	  beneficial for devices running Samba, like NAS or file sharing servers on your
	  local network.
