  <title>A Web Server Log File Analysis Program</title>
  <description>Webalizer is a web server log file analysis program which produces
usage statistics in HTML format for viewing with a browser.  The
results are presented in both columnar and graphical formats, which
facilitates interpretation.  Yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly usage
statistics are presented, along with the ability to display usage by
site, URL, referrer, user agent (browser) and country (user agent and
referrer are only available if your web server produces Combined log
format files).

Webalizer supports CLF (common log format) log files, as well as
Combined log formats as defined by NCSA and others, and variations of
these which it attempts to handle intelligently.</description>
