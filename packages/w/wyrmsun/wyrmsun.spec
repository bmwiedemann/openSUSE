%description
In the Wyrmsun universe a myriad of inhabited planets exist. Humans dwell on Earth,
while dwarves inhabit Nidavellir and elves nourish the world of Alfheim. These
peoples struggle to carve a place for themselves with their tools of stone, bronze
and iron. And perhaps one day they will meet one another, beyond the stars...
