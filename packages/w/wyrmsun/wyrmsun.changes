    + Fixed issue which caused a crash when starting the Italy

      of e.g. stone piles.
    + Fixed issue which allowed the Anglo-Saxon civilization to be
      chosen for custom games even if they started at the most
      basic technological level (the bronze age), even though the
      Anglo-Saxons are an iron age civilization.
  * Pathfinding
    + Fixed a pathfinding issue which could cause minecarts to get
      stuck when looking for a place to return goods to.
  * Quests
    + Fixed issue which caused the defeat to be triggered for
      certain quests when a required hero died only after their
      corpse had completely withered away.
    + Added side-quests for producing furniture for the Anglo-Saxon
      and Norse civilizations, as well as for some Teutonic factions
  * Scenarios
    + Added several mini-forts with neutral hostile Gnoll Warriors,
      randomly-placed on the Earth map in areas where there were
      historically werehyena myths (i.e. North Africa).
