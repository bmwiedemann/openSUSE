Sun Feb 28 15:20:26 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.1.4
  * AI
    + Fixed issue which resulted in AI players being able to hire
      units from any civilization from mercenary camps (no matter
      the civilization of the mercenary faction itself).
  * Maps
    + Fixed freeze/crash when starting the Southern Baltic map.
    + Fixed issue which caused settlement territories to not be
      generated on certain custom maps.
  * Miscellaneous
    + Fixed a potential crash cause when processing triggers.
    + Fixed issue which caused certain site positions (e.g. that
      where the Hlesey revealer should be created for the
      Thunraz's Servant scenario) to not be saved in a save game.
    + Fixed issue which could mistakenly cause under certain
      circumstances a removed settlement site to be saved (when
      saving a game) as the settlement head unit for a settlement,
      instead of the town hall which had been built on top of it.
    + The preferences.txt file is now saved in AppData instead of
      in the Documents folder.
    + Improved save/load performance and memory usage for player
      tile exploration.
    + Improved the performance of the database parsing and image
      scaling.
  * Resources
    + Added checks to prevent the stored resource quantity from
      becoming negative.
  * Units
    + Added Hobgoblin Warrior unit.

Thu Jan 28 21:37:54 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.1.3
  * AI
  + Fixed issue which made the AI be able to take quests even if
    it didn't have a town hall.
  * Items
  - Fixed issue which allowed magic prefixes to be generated as
    suffixes and vice-versa.
  * Interface
  - Renamed the "Quests" screen to "Legacy Quests", to better
    reflect that these are missions in an old format, and which are
    supposed to be eventually updated to the Scenario mode.
  - Fixed interface issues (e.g. incorrect button placement) which
    occurred after enabling the 2x scaled mode without restarting.
  - Added terrain-only minimap mode.
  - Added settlement territories (including non-land) minimap mode.
  * Map Editor
  - Fixed crash which could occur when clicking on the "OK" button
    in the player properties dialog.
  - Fixed the position of the editor tile tooltip in the
    bottom-left in the 2x scaled mode.
  * Multiplayer
  - Fixed a potential desync cause due to floating point operations.
  * Scenarios
  - Fixed crash when picking the option to seek an alliance with the
    Hersings in the Haimadala's Progeny scenario.
  * Units
  - When randomly moving, people-averse fauna units will no longer
    enter a tile with an owner if their current tile is in an
    unowned one. In effect, this means that e.g. wyrms will not
    wander into settled areas if they start off in an unsettled
    one until their starting area itself is settled.

  * Buildings
    + Fixed the variation conditions for Germanic and Teutonic
      Docks.
  * Miscellaneous
    + Fixed a potential crash when exiting a loaded saved game.
  * Pathfinding
    + Fixed a resource-gathering pathfinding issue which occurred
      if e.g. wood piles were adjacent to the building to which
      the resource would be returned, and one of the adjacent
      wood piles were unreachable.
- Update to version 4.0.4
  * Maps
    + Fixed issue which caused a crash when starting the Italy
      custom map.
  * Miscellaneous
    + Fixed a save game load issue which occurred if a reference
      was held to a destroyed unit.
    + Fixed crash which occurred when right-clicking the portrait
      of e.g. stone piles.
    + Fixed issue which allowed the Anglo-Saxon civilization to be
      chosen for custom games even if they started at the most
      basic technological level (the bronze age), even though the
      Anglo-Saxons are an iron age civilization.
  * Pathfinding
    + Fixed a pathfinding issue which could cause minecarts to get
      stuck when looking for a place to return goods to.
  * Quests
    + Fixed issue which caused the defeat to be triggered for
      certain quests when a required hero died only after their
      corpse had completely withered away.
    + Added side-quests for producing furniture for the Anglo-Saxon
      and Norse civilizations, as well as for some Teutonic factions
  * Scenarios
    + Added several mini-forts with neutral hostile Gnoll Warriors,
      randomly-placed on the Earth map in areas where there were
      historically werehyena myths (i.e. North Africa).
