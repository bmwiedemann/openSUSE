Mon Oct  4 09:40:28 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 5.2.0
  Map Editor
  + Setting a tile's terrain in the editor will now remove any
    units on it which are incompatible with the new terrain.
    Previously, they would be bumped to the nearest valid tile.
  + Fixed issue which caused hue-rotated terrain to not show up
    with the correct color in the map editor's tile selection menu.
  Maps
  + Fixed issue which could cause a settlement with no minimap
    color to be picked for settlement site generation in random
    maps.
  + Removed the obsolete Gardariki, Italy, Southern Baltic and
    Tanais custom maps.
  Miscellaneous
  + Fixed issue which could cause player data to not be cleared
    properly after a game.
  + Fixed visibility issue which could occur when destroying cave
    walls during a game.
  + Reworked how the minimap keeps track of unexplored/fog of war
    areas, improving performance (specially on larger maps).
  + The Steam launcher has been rewritten in C++, with QML being
    used for the UI. In order to prevent issues if both the
    launcher and Wyrmsun try to access the file in which persistent
    achievement data is contained at the same time, the launcher
    now only checks just before and just after the game runs.
  Pathfinding
  + Fixed a pathfinding issue involving land/fly-low units.
  Quests
  + Quest completion data is now stored in
    [AppData]/Wyrmsun/quests.txt, instead of in the game's
    directory.
  + Achievement data is now stored in
    [AppData]/Wyrmsun/achievements.txt, instead of in the game's
    directory.
  + Fixed crash which occurred when Lua scripts tried to create a
    new player during a game, which occurred e.g. for the
    introductory dialogue of the A Bargain is Struck legacy quest.
  Terrain
  + Fixed issue which caused forest regeneration to not trigger.
  + The cave floor, desert sand and ford transition graphics have
    been updated.
  + Added new cave floor, desert sand and ford decoration tiles.
  User Interface
  + Improved the performance of the code which identifies which
    unit is currently under the cursor.
  + Fixed key input issue which could cause command panel buttons
    without hotkeys to be triggered in a seemingly random fashion.
- Update to version 5.1.0
  Maps
  + Removed the obsolete Svarinshaug custom map.
  + Fixed issue which caused maps in the user map folder to not
    appear the Custom Game menu.
  + Removed the Aquitania custom map.
  Miscellaneous
  + Saved games are now stored in [AppData]/Wyrmsun/save, instead
    of in the game's directory.
  * Scenarios
  + Fixed issue which caused some of the Western Migration
    triggers to not work properly.
  Terrain
  + The dirt, dry mud, ice and mud transition graphics have been
    updated.
  + Added new dirt and ice decoration tiles.
  Units
  + Added Brown Bear, Black Bear and Polar Bear unit types. Brown
    bears are now generated in the Earth/Europe scenario map.
  User Interface
  + Fixed issue which caused dropdowns to gain keyboard focus
    when clicked.
  + Fixed issue which caused text fields to not lose keyboard
    focus when clicked away from.
  + Fixed issue which caused key events to be propagated to
    buttons even though a text field had focus.
  + Reworked the in-game menu to be QML-based.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 16:53:30 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

  + Updated the territory setup for the Tyrol area for the Earth
    map (scenario mode).

  + Fixed issue with the save game functionality.
  + Fixed issue with loading a saved game from within a game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 21 14:37:35 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 5.0.0
  * Buildings
    + Town halls, strongholds, mines and hunting lodges no longer
      leave a destroyed building "corpse".
  * Encyclopedia
    + Added support for encyclopedia entries having links to each
      other.
    + Updated the literary texts for the encyclopedia, streamlining
      them (removing footnotes and the "|" character which denoted
      a caesura/break within a verse).
  * Factions
    + Fixed the requirements string for the Shadowcharm Clan
      faction.
    - Renamed the "Goth Tribe" to "Gothic Tribe", the
      "Ostrogoth Tribe" to "Ostrogothic Tribe" and the
      "Visigoth Tribe" to "Visigothic Tribe".
    - Renamed the "Swede Tribe" to "Swedish Tribe".
  * Heroes
    + It is no longer possible to start a custom game with a custom
      hero, they must now be recruited as other heroes are.
    + Updated the hero symbol icon to use a frame, to make it more
      visible on the map.
  * Items
    + Added "Curupira's" magic prefix for weapons (+3 fire damage).
    + Added Potion of Mana.
    + Made it so the Elixir of Vitality has a purple color
      (previously it was gray), to make it more distinct from the
      Elixir of Dexterity (which is black).
  * Map Editor
    + Fixed crash which occurred when pressing the "OK" button in
      the player properties dialog.
    + Fixed issue which caused solid overlay tiles to not be
      displayed in the editor.
    + Removed the old mod creation tools from the map editor, due
      to the amount of maintenance they required, as well as their
      reliance on outdated parts of the engine. A mod creation user
      interface may come back in some form in the future.
  * Miscellaneous
    + Removed the No Randomness and No Day/Night Cycle options.
    + Fixed crash which occurring when accessing Goblin sound
      options within a game.
    + Removed the faction dropdown from the custom game menu, as a
      faction prompt already comes when starting the game.
    + Removed the tech tree level dropdowns from the custom game
      menu.
    + Persistent data (e.g. hero levels or quest completion) will
      no longer be altered during a game if a cheat was used.
  * Mods
    + Removed the mods submenu, as it only supported mods in an
      old format.
  * Quests
    + Added a couple of side-quests which only occur on certain
      days of the week in the real world with the objective of
      acquiring the upgrade of the corresponding deity, for the
      Norse and Anglo-Saxon civilizations. For instance, the Norse
      "Tysdag" quest only occurs on a Tuesday, and has the
      objective of choosing the Tyr deity.
    + Added two side-quests for the Germanic civilization to build
      smithies.
  * Scenarios
    + Fixed crash which occurred when starting the Thunraz's
      Servant scenario.
    + Added more predefined settlement territories for the Earth
      map.
    + Added starting caravan for the Goldhoof Clan in the A Home
      in the Fields of Sand scenario.
    + Added the Heimdall's Stones unique building to the new Earth
      map for the correct start dates.
    + The A Home in the Fields of Sand scenario now starts during
      summer.
    + Improved the quality of the projection used for the Earth map.
  * Terrain
    + Added new dry mud and mud decoration tiles.
    + Dry Grass terrain no longer becomes covered in snow during
      winter.
  * Units
    + Fixed crash which occurred when a ranged unit was garrisoned
      inside a caravan while near enemies.
    + Increased Spearman damage from 5 to 6.
    + Minecarts can now move diagonally, and can move outside of
      railroads with a large speed penalty (-5).
  * Upgrades
    + Added Oil Lamp upgrade (+1 sight range for buildings),
      researchable at the Market.
    + Added the Furor Teutonicus upgrade for the Teutonic
      civilization (+2 Damage for infantry), researchable at the
      Barracks.
    + Added the House-Burning upgrade for the Norse civilization
      (+20% Bonus vs. Buildings for infantry), researchable at
      the Barracks.
  * User Interface
    + Reworked the main menu to be QML-based.
    + F11 is now the screenshot hotkey.
    + Reworked the game's rendering system, graphical interface
      and input system to use the Qt Framework.
    + The game is now always in borderless fullscreen mode, as
      the new UI framework supports that. The main purpose of the
      windowed mode was to allow alt-tabbing seamlessly, which the
      borderless fullscreen mode also provides. And unlike the old
      fullscreen functionality, this supports any resolution.
    + Reworked the tech tree menu.
    + The scenario menu is now depicted as a tree.
    + Added a submenu for managing custom heroes, and made it
      possible to add a description to them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 28 15:20:26 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.1.4
  * AI
    + Fixed issue which resulted in AI players being able to hire
      units from any civilization from mercenary camps (no matter
      the civilization of the mercenary faction itself).
  * Maps
    + Fixed freeze/crash when starting the Southern Baltic map.
    + Fixed issue which caused settlement territories to not be
      generated on certain custom maps.
  * Miscellaneous
    + Fixed a potential crash cause when processing triggers.
    + Fixed issue which caused certain site positions (e.g. that
      where the Hlesey revealer should be created for the
      Thunraz's Servant scenario) to not be saved in a save game.
    + Fixed issue which could mistakenly cause under certain
      circumstances a removed settlement site to be saved (when
      saving a game) as the settlement head unit for a settlement,
      instead of the town hall which had been built on top of it.
    + The preferences.txt file is now saved in AppData instead of
      in the Documents folder.
    + Improved save/load performance and memory usage for player
      tile exploration.
    + Improved the performance of the database parsing and image
      scaling.
  * Resources
    + Added checks to prevent the stored resource quantity from
      becoming negative.
  * Units
    + Added Hobgoblin Warrior unit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 28 21:37:54 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 4.1.3
  * AI
  + Fixed issue which made the AI be able to take quests even if
    it didn't have a town hall.
  * Items
  - Fixed issue which allowed magic prefixes to be generated as
    suffixes and vice-versa.
  * Interface
  - Renamed the "Quests" screen to "Legacy Quests", to better
    reflect that these are missions in an old format, and which are
    supposed to be eventually updated to the Scenario mode.
  - Fixed interface issues (e.g. incorrect button placement) which
    occurred after enabling the 2x scaled mode without restarting.
  - Added terrain-only minimap mode.
  - Added settlement territories (including non-land) minimap mode.
  * Map Editor
  - Fixed crash which could occur when clicking on the "OK" button
    in the player properties dialog.
  - Fixed the position of the editor tile tooltip in the
    bottom-left in the 2x scaled mode.
  * Multiplayer
  - Fixed a potential desync cause due to floating point operations.
  * Scenarios
  - Fixed crash when picking the option to seek an alliance with the
    Hersings in the Haimadala's Progeny scenario.
  * Units
  - When randomly moving, people-averse fauna units will no longer
    enter a tile with an owner if their current tile is in an
    unowned one. In effect, this means that e.g. wyrms will not
    wander into settled areas if they start off in an unsettled
    one until their starting area itself is settled.

  * Miscellaneous
    + Fixed a potential crash when exiting a loaded saved game.
  * Pathfinding
    + Fixed a resource-gathering pathfinding issue which occurred

      the resource would be returned, and one of the adjacent
      wood piles were unreachable.
- Update to version 4.0.4
  * Maps
    + Fixed issue which caused a crash when starting the Italy
      custom map.

      of e.g. stone piles.

      chosen for custom games even if they started at the most
      basic technological level (the bronze age), even though the
      Anglo-Saxons are an iron age civilization.
  * Pathfinding
    + Fixed a pathfinding issue which could cause minecarts to get
      stuck when looking for a place to return goods to.
  * Quests
    + Fixed issue which caused the defeat to be triggered for
      certain quests when a required hero died only after their
      corpse had completely withered away.
    + Added side-quests for producing furniture for the Anglo-Saxon
      and Norse civilizations, as well as for some Teutonic factions
  * Scenarios
    + Added several mini-forts with neutral hostile Gnoll Warriors,

      historically werehyena myths (i.e. North Africa).
