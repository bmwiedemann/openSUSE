    <comment>- update to 5.2.3
  * Readme update
  * Revert &quot;Added test random Earth&quot;
- Update to version 5.2.0
  Map Editor
  + Setting a tile's terrain in the editor will now remove any
    units on it which are incompatible with the new terrain.
    Previously, they would be bumped to the nearest valid tile.
  + Fixed issue which caused hue-rotated terrain to not show up
    with the correct color in the map editor's tile selection menu.
  Maps
  + Fixed issue which could cause a settlement with no minimap
    color to be picked for settlement site generation in random
    maps.
  + Removed the obsolete Gardariki, Italy, Southern Baltic and
    Tanais custom maps.
  Miscellaneous
  + Fixed issue which could cause player data to not be cleared
    properly after a game.
  + Fixed visibility issue which could occur when destroying cave
    walls during a game.
  + Reworked how the minimap keeps track of unexplored/fog of war
    areas, improving performance (specially on larger maps).
  + The Steam launcher has been rewritten in C++, with QML being
    used for the UI. In order to prevent issues if both the
    launcher and Wyrmsun try to access the file in which persistent
    achievement data is contained at the same time, the launcher
    now only checks just before and just after the game runs.
  Pathfinding
  + Fixed a pathfinding issue involving land/fly-low units.
  Quests
  + Quest completion data is now stored in
    [AppData]/Wyrmsun/quests.txt, instead of in the game's
    directory.
  + Achievement data is now stored in
    [AppData]/Wyrmsun/achievements.txt, instead of in the game's
    directory.
  + Fixed crash which occurred when Lua scripts tried to create a
    new player during a game, which occurred e.g. for the
    introductory dialogue of the A Bargain is Struck legacy quest.
  Terrain
  + Fixed issue which caused forest regeneration to not trigger.
  + The cave floor, desert sand and ford transition graphics have
    been updated.
  + Added new cave floor, desert sand and ford decoration tiles.
  User Interface
  + Improved the performance of the code which identifies which
    unit is currently under the cursor.
  + Fixed key input issue which could cause command panel buttons
    without hotkeys to be triggered in a seemingly random fashion.
- Update to version 5.1.0
  Maps
  + Removed the obsolete Svarinshaug custom map.
  + Fixed issue which caused maps in the user map folder to not
    appear the Custom Game menu.
  + Removed the Aquitania custom map.
  Miscellaneous
  + Saved games are now stored in [AppData]/Wyrmsun/save, instead
    of in the game's directory.
  * Scenarios
  + Fixed issue which caused some of the Western Migration
    triggers to not work properly.
  Terrain
  + The dirt, dry mud, ice and mud transition graphics have been
    updated.
  + Added new dirt and ice decoration tiles.
  Units
  + Added Brown Bear, Black Bear and Polar Bear unit types. Brown
    bears are now generated in the Earth/Europe scenario map.
  User Interface
  + Fixed issue which caused dropdowns to gain keyboard focus
    when clicked.
  + Fixed issue which caused text fields to not lose keyboard
    focus when clicked away from.
  + Fixed issue which caused key events to be propagated to
    buttons even though a text field had focus.
  + Reworked the in-game menu to be QML-based.
