%description
Functions for queueing networks and Markov chains analysis.
This package can be used to compute steady-state performance measures
for open, closed and mixed networks with single or multiple job classes.
Mean Value Analysis (MVA), convolution, and various bounding techniques are
implemented. Furthermore, several transient and steady-state performance
measures for Markov chains can be computed, such as state occupancy
probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged sojourn times
and so forth. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains are supported.
This is part of the Octave-Forge project.
