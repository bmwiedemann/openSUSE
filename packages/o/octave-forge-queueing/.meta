  <description>Functions for queueing networks and Markov chains analysis. This package can be used to compute steady-state performance measures
for open, closed and mixed networks with single or multiple job classes. Mean Value Analysis (MVA), convolution, and various bounding techniques are implemented. Furthermore, several transient and steady-state performance measures for Markov chains can be computed, such as state occupancy probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged sojourn times and so forth. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains are supported.
