  <title>Inline (Unit) Tests for OCaml</title>
  <description>qtest extracts inline unit tests written using a special syntax in
comments. Those tests are then run using the oUnit framework and the
qcheck library. The possibilities range from trivial tests -- extremely
simple to use -- to sophisticated random generation of test cases.</description>
