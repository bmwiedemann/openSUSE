%description
This package contains a linux kernel module implementing the data channel of
the OpenVPN protocol in the linux kernel.

This kernel module allows OpenVPN to offload any data plane management to the
linux kernel, thus allowing it to exploit any Linux low level API, while
avoiding expensive and slow payload transfer between kernel space and
user space.

LIMITATIONS
* Only AEAD mode and 'none' (with no auth) supported
* Only AES-GCM and CHACHA20POLY1305 ciphers supported
