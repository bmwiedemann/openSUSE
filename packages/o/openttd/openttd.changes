 * Feature:
   - [GFX] Climate-specific Action5 extra airport sprites
   - Draw vertical separators at tile distance in the train depot GUI
   - [Build] Project file generator for kdevelop 4/5
   - Add option to close windows with right click
   - Vehicle Group Info: Add profits and occupancy display to group vehicle list
   - Display aircraft type in vehicle preview/purchase/detail windows
 * Change:
   - [NewGRF] Various performance improvements to resolving VA2
   - [NewGRF] Increase maximum allowed vehicle sprite size to reduce
       clipping of ships
   - Check companies for bankruptcy before subtracting reoccuring monthly costs
   - [GFX] Replace the office building sprite on various toyland airports
       with a better fitting sprite
   - [GFX] The switch-toolbar icon contained pixels from the fire cycle.
       Replace the whole icon with a new version

       when shift-clicking
   - Parse extmidi command string for parameters to pass on
   - Draw images in centre of buttons
 * Fix:
   - Store the map variety setting in the savegame like the other mapgen

   - Hair selection was missing one option
   - Avoid tile operations outside map border when building lock
   - Catenary sprites got mixed up for depots
   - Make automatic window-positioning RTL-aware
   - Automatic window-positioning now uses GUI-scale/style dependent

       the new triggers
   - [NewGRF] Reset used random triggers only after all A123 chains have
       been resolved, so that all RA2 in all chains can test the shared triggers
   - [NewGRF] Industry random triggers are stored per tile, even when
       randomising the shared random bits of the parent industry
   - [NPF] Reserved track bits were not accounted for when trying to find
       any safe position
   - Do not modify argv[0]
   - Do not search directories when opening ini files as we already have
       their full path
   - Road tunnel/bridge heads have no trackbits wrt. catenary drawing

- update to new release 1.7.2
  * Change: When train depots have a horizontal scrollbar, allow
    scrolling 1 tile beyond the longest train, so you can actually

      exactly match the length of the dragged wagon chain (r27936)
    - Forest, candyfloss forest and battery farm skipped the first
      animation frame
    - Glyphs in range U+0020 to U+00FF may only be defined in
      orig_extra.grf, not in openttd.grf
    - 'unban' console command was not handling IPv6 adresses properly
    - Keep the 'link' between industry chain and smallmap windows
      whenever possible
    - When the last vehicle is removed from a shared orders group,
      hide the 'Stop sharing' button in the vehicle orders window
    - Tooltip of 'increase service interval' said 'decrease'
    - Console command parser passed invalid strings to the debug
      output, if command lines had many parameters
