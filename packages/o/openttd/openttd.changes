   - Display aircraft type in vehicle preview/purchase/detail windows
 * Change:
   - [NewGRF] Various performance improvements to resolving VA2
   - [NewGRF] Increase maximum allowed vehicle sprite size to reduce
       clipping of ships
   - Check companies for bankruptcy before subtracting reoccuring monthly costs
   - [GFX] Replace the office building sprite on various toyland airports
       with a better fitting sprite
   - [GFX] The switch-toolbar icon contained pixels from the fire cycle.

   - [NewGRF] Industry random triggers are stored per tile, even when
       randomising the shared random bits of the parent industry
   - [NPF] Reserved track bits were not accounted for when trying to find
       any safe position
   - Do not modify argv[0]

- update to new release 1.7.2
  * Change: When train depots have a horizontal scrollbar, allow

      exactly match the length of the dragged wagon chain (r27936)
    - Forest, candyfloss forest and battery farm skipped the first
      animation frame
    - Glyphs in range U+0020 to U+00FF may only be defined in
      orig_extra.grf, not in openttd.grf
    - 'unban' console command was not handling IPv6 adresses properly
    - Keep the 'link' between industry chain and smallmap windows
      whenever possible
    - When the last vehicle is removed from a shared orders group,
      hide the 'Stop sharing' button in the vehicle orders window
    - Tooltip of 'increase service interval' said 'decrease'
    - Console command parser passed invalid strings to the debug
      output, if command lines had many parameters
