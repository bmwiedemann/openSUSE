-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  1 15:24:46 UTC 2023 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.1.2:
  * Fix excessive time spent checking DH q parameter value
    (bsc#1213853, CVE-2023-3817). The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it
    was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
    an overly long computation during some of these checks. A
    correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus
    p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if
    q is larger than p. If DH_check() is called with such q parameter
    value, DH_CHECK_INVALID_Q_VALUE return flag is set and the
    computationally intensive checks are skipped.
  * Fix DH_check() excessive time with over sized modulus
    (bsc#1213487, CVE-2023-3446). The function DH_check() performs
    various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms
    that the modulus ("p" parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
    a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use
    a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the
    DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or
    parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the
    supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be
    too large. A new limit has been added to DH_check of 32,768 bits.
    Supplying a key/parameters with a modulus over this size will
    simply cause DH_check() to fail.
  * Do not ignore empty associated data entries with AES-SIV
    (bsc#1213383, CVE-2023-2975). The AES-SIV algorithm allows for
    authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the
    encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as
    the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV
    implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such call
    instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
    The empty data thus will not be authenticated. The fix changes the
    authentication tag value and the ciphertext for applications that
    use empty associated data entries with AES-SIV. To decrypt data
    encrypted with previous versions of OpenSSL the application has to
    skip calls to EVP_DecryptUpdate() for empty associated data entries.
  * When building with the enable-fips option and using the resulting
    FIPS provider, TLS 1.2 will, by default, mandate the use of an
    extended master secret (FIPS 140-3 IG G.Q) and the Hash and HMAC
    DRBGs will not operate with truncated digests (FIPS 140-3 IG G.R).
  * Update openssl.keyring with the OTC members that sign releases
  * Remove openssl-z16-s390x.patch fixed upstream in

  * Restrict the size of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs that OBJ_obj2txt will translate
    (CVE-2023-2650, bsc#1211430)
  * Multiple algorithm implementation fixes for ARM BE platforms.
  * Added a -pedantic option to fipsinstall that adjusts the various settings
    to ensure strict FIPS compliance rather than backwards compatibility.
  * Fixed buffer overread in AES-XTS decryption on ARM 64 bit platforms which
    happens if the buffer size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte AES blocks. This can
    trigger a crash of an application using AES-XTS decryption if the memory
    just after the buffer being decrypted is not mapped. Thanks to Anton
    Romanov (Amazon) for discovering the issue. (CVE-2023-1255, bsc#1210714)
  * Add FIPS provider configuration option to disallow the use of truncated
    digests with Hash and HMAC DRBGs (q.v. FIPS 140-3 IG D.R.). The
    option '-no_drbg_truncated_digests' can optionally be supplied
    to 'openssl fipsinstall'.
  * Corrected documentation of X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() to mention that
    it does not enable policy checking. Thanks to David Benjamin for
    discovering this issue. (CVE-2023-0466, bsc#1209873)
  * Fixed an issue where invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are
    silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are
    skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to
    deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent
    policy checking on the certificate altogether. (CVE-2023-0465, bsc#1209878)
  * Limited the number of nodes created in a policy tree to mitigate against
    CVE-2023-0464. The default limit is set to 1000 nodes, which should be
    sufficient for most installations. If required, the limit can be adjusted
    by setting the OPENSSL_POLICY_TREE_NODES_MAX build time define to a
    desired maximum number of nodes or zero to allow unlimited growth.

- Update to 3.1.0:
  * Add FIPS provider configuration option to enforce the Extended Master
    Secret (EMS) check during the TLS1_PRF KDF. The option '-ems-check' can
    optionally be supplied to 'openssl fipsinstall'.
  * The FIPS provider includes a few non-approved algorithms for backward
    compatibility purposes and the "fips=yes" property query must be used for
    all algorithm fetches to ensure FIPS compliance. The algorithms that are
    included but not approved are Triple DES ECB, Triple DES CBC and EdDSA.
  * Added support for KMAC in KBKDF.
  * RNDR and RNDRRS support in provider functions to provide random number
    generation for Arm CPUs (aarch64).
  * s_client and s_server apps now explicitly say when the TLS version does not
    include the renegotiation mechanism. This avoids confusion between that
    scenario versus when the TLS version includes secure renegotiation but the
    peer lacks support for it.
  * AES-GCM enabled with AVX512 vAES and vPCLMULQDQ.
  * The various OBJ_* functions have been made thread safe.
  * Parallel dual-prime 1536/2048-bit modular exponentiation for AVX512_IFMA
    capable processors.
  * The functions OPENSSL_LH_stats, OPENSSL_LH_node_stats,
    OPENSSL_LH_node_usage_stats, OPENSSL_LH_stats_bio,
    OPENSSL_LH_node_stats_bio and OPENSSL_LH_node_usage_stats_bio are now
    marked deprecated from OpenSSL 3.1 onwards and can be disabled by defining
    OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_3_1. The macro DEFINE_LHASH_OF is now deprecated in
    favour of the macro DEFINE_LHASH_OF_EX, which omits the corresponding
    type-specific function definitions for these functions regardless of
    whether OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_3_1 is defined. Users of DEFINE_LHASH_OF may
    start receiving deprecation warnings for these functions regardless of
    whether they are using them. It is recommended that users transition to the
    new macro, DEFINE_LHASH_OF_EX.
  * When generating safe-prime DH parameters set the recommended private key
    length equivalent to minimum key lengths as in RFC 7919.
  * Change the default salt length for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS signatures to the
    maximum size that is smaller or equal to the digest length to comply with
    FIPS 186-4 section 5. This is implemented by a new option
    OSSL_PKEY_RSA_PSS_SALT_LEN_AUTO_DIGEST_MAX ("auto-digestmax") for the
    rsa_pss_saltlen parameter, which is now the default. Signature verification
    is not affected by this change and continues to work as before.
  * Update openssl.keyring with key

Tue Feb  7 15:43:22 UTC 2023 - Otto Hollmann <otto.hollmann@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.8:
  * Fixed NULL dereference during PKCS7 data verification.
    A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
    verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
    algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
    the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
    initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
    value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
    usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.
    ([bsc#1207541, CVE-2023-0401])

    PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
    time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
    not call these functions however third party applications would be
    affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
    data.
  * Fixed X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName.
    There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
    inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING
    but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified
    the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather
    than an ASN1_STRING.

    When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
    X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to
    pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory
    contents or enact a denial of service.
    ([bsc#1207533, CVE-2023-0286])
  * Fixed NULL dereference validating DSA public key.
    An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
    application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
    EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead
    to an application crash. This function can be called on public
    keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
    to cause a denial of service attack.

    The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
    but applications might call the function if there are additional
    security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
    ([bsc#1207540, CVE-2023-0217])
  * Fixed Invalid pointer dereference in d2i_PKCS7 functions.
    An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
    application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
    d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.

    The result of the dereference is an application crash which could
    lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
    does not call this function however third party applications might
    call these functions on untrusted data.
    ([bsc#1207539, CVE-2023-0216])
  * Fixed Use-after-free following BIO_new_NDEF.
    The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for
    streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL
    to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also
    be called directly by end user applications.

    The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1
    filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns
    the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions,
    for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO
    is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure.
    However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the
    BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously
    freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO
    then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.
    ([bsc#1207536, CVE-2023-0215])
  * Fixed Double free after calling PEM_read_bio_ex.
    The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
    decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload
    data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data"
    arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant
    decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is
    possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.
    In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
    the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.
    If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This
    will most likely lead to a crash.

    The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around
    PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

    These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
    functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and
    SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL
    internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does
    not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code.
    ([bsc#1207538, CVE-2022-4450])
  * Fixed Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption.
    A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
    implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across
    a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number
    of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding
    modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.
    ([bsc#1207534, CVE-2022-4304])
  * Fixed X.509 Name Constraints Read Buffer Overflow.
    A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
    specifically in name constraint checking. The read buffer overrun might
    result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack.
    In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
    server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
    client authentication and a malicious client connects.
    ([bsc#1207535, CVE-2022-4203])
  * Fixed X.509 Policy Constraints Double Locking security issue.
    If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
    policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
    recursively.  On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
    results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy
    processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
    to be a common setup.
    ([CVE-2022-3996])
  * Our provider implementations of `OSSL_FUNC_KEYMGMT_EXPORT` and
    `OSSL_FUNC_KEYMGMT_GET_PARAMS` for EC and SM2 keys now honor
    `OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_EC_POINT_CONVERSION_FORMAT` as set (and
    default to `POINT_CONVERSION_UNCOMPRESSED`) when exporting
    `OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_PUB_KEY`, instead of unconditionally using
    `POINT_CONVERSION_COMPRESSED` as in previous 3.x releases.
    For symmetry, our implementation of `EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD->export_to`
    for legacy EC and SM2 keys is also changed similarly to honor the
    equivalent conversion format flag as specified in the underlying
    `EC_KEY` object being exported to a provider, when this function is
    called through `EVP_PKEY_export()`.

- Update to 3.0.7: [bsc#1204714, CVE-2022-3602,CVE-2022-3786]
  * Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.
    A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
    specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
    certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
    have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
    certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
    issuer.

    In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
    server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
    client authentication and a malicious client connects.

    An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
    an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)
    on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
    denial of service).
    ([CVE-2022-3786])

    An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
    attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could
    result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
    execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
    ([CVE-2022-3602])
  * Removed all references to invalid OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA names for CRT
    parameters in OpenSSL code.
    Applications should not use the names OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA_FACTOR,
    OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA_EXPONENT and OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA_COEFFICIENT.
    Use the numbered names such as OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA_FACTOR1 instead.

- Update to 3.0.6: [bsc#1204226, CVE-2022-3358]
  * OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy
    EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function
    was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged
    to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers.
  * OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers
    passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and
    EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption
    and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher
    directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the
    available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed
    to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID
    for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly
    pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When
    NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption
    initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and
    will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the
    default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been
    loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the
    plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext.
  * Applications are only affected by this issue if they call
    EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to
    an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use
    SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. ([CVE-2022-3358])
  * Fix LLVM vs Apple LLVM version numbering confusion that caused build
    failures on MacOS 10.11
  * Fixed the linux-mips64 Configure target which was missing the SIXTY_FOUR_BIT
    bn_ops flag. This was causing heap corruption on that platform.
  * Fix handling of a ticket key callback that returns 0 in TLSv1.3 to not send
    a ticket
  * Correctly handle a retransmitted ClientHello in DTLS
  * Fixed detection of ktls support in cross-compile environment on Linux
  * Fixed some regressions and test failures when running the 3.0.0 FIPS
    provider against 3.0.x
  * Fixed SSL_pending() and SSL_has_pending() with DTLS which were failing to
    report correct results in some cases
  * Fix UWP builds by defining VirtualLock
  * For known safe primes use the minimum key length according to RFC 7919.
    Longer private key sizes unnecessarily raise the cycles needed to compute
    the shared secret without any increase of the real security. This fixes a
    regression from 1.1.1 where these shorter keys were generated for the known
    safe primes.
  * Added the loongarch64 target
  * Fixed EC ASM flag passing. Flags for ASM implementations of EC curves were
    only passed to the FIPS provider and not to the default or legacy provider.
  * Fixed reported performance degradation on aarch64. Restored the
    implementation prior to commit 2621751 ("aes/asm/aesv8-armx.pl: avoid 32-bit
    lane assignment in CTR mode") for 64bit targets only, since it is reportedly
    2-17% slower and the silicon errata only affects 32bit targets. The new
    algorithm is still used for 32 bit targets.
  * Added a missing header for memcmp that caused compilation failure on some
    platforms

Thu Jul 21 09:09:07 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.5:
  * The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA
    implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions.
    This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys
    incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during
    the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker
    may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing
    the computation.
    SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running
    on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture
    are affected by this issue. [bsc#1201148, CVE-2022-2274]
  * AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised
    implementation would not encrypt the entirety of the data under some
    circumstances.  This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was
    preexisting in the memory that wasn't written.  In the special case of
    "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed.
    Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS,
    they are both unaffected. [bsc#1201099, CVE-2022-2097]

- Update to 3.0.4: [bsc#1199166, CVE-2022-1292]
  * In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
    CVE-2022-1292, further bugs where the c_rehash script does not
    properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection
    have been fixed.
    When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there
    are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
    being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.
    This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where
    it is automatically executed.  On such operating systems, an attacker
    could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.
    Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced
    by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
  * Case insensitive string comparison no longer uses locales.
    It has instead been directly implemented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 18 12:03:21 UTC 2022 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.3:
  * Case insensitive string comparison is reimplemented via new locale-agnostic
    comparison functions OPENSSL_str[n]casecmp always using the POSIX locale for
    comparison. The previous implementation had problems when the Turkish locale
    was used.
  * Fixed a bug in the c_rehash script which was not properly sanitising shell
    metacharacters to prevent command injection.  This script is distributed by
    some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed.  On
    such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the
    privileges of the script.
    Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced
    by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. [bsc#1199166, CVE-2022-1292]
  * Fixed a bug in the function 'OCSP_basic_verify' that verifies the signer
    certificate on an OCSP response. The bug caused the function in the case
    where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used to return a postivie
    response (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the
    response signing certificate fails to verify.
    It is anticipated that most users of 'OCSP_basic_verify' will not use the
    OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the 'OCSP_basic_verify' function will return
    a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate
    verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0.
    This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL "ocsp" application. When
    verifying an ocsp response with the "-no_cert_checks" option the command line
    application will report that the verification is successful even though it
    has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also
    be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the
    apparently successful result. [bsc#1199167, CVE-2022-1343]
  * Fixed a bug where the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly used the
    AAD data as the MAC key. This made the MAC key trivially predictable.
    An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack
    to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such
    that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check.
    Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0
    endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will
    fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from
    the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL
    3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client.
    [bsc#1199168, CVE-2022-1434]
  * Fix a bug in the OPENSSL_LH_flush() function that breaks reuse of the memory
    occuppied by the removed hash table entries.
    This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived
    process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will
    expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating
    system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table
    entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes
    might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate
    authentication. [bsc#1199169, CVE-2022-1473]
  * The functions 'OPENSSL_LH_stats' and 'OPENSSL_LH_stats_bio' now only report
    the 'num_items', 'num_nodes' and 'num_alloc_nodes' statistics. All other
    statistics are no longer supported. For compatibility, these statistics are
    still listed in the output but are now always reported as zero.

  * RNDR and RNDRRS support in provider functions to provide
    random number generation for Arm CPUs (aarch64).
  * s_client and s_server apps now explicitly say when the TLS
    version does not include the renegotiation mechanism. This
    avoids confusion between that scenario versus when the TLS
    version includes secure renegotiation but the peer lacks
    support for it.
  * The default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2.
    RSA, DSA and DH keys of 1024 bits and above and less than 2048
    bits and ECC keys of 160 bits and above and less than 224 bits
    were previously accepted by default but are now no longer
    allowed. By default TLS compression was already disabled in
    previous OpenSSL versions. At security level 2 it cannot be
    enabled.
  * The SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list family functions now accept
    ciphers using their IANA standard names.
  * The PVK key derivation function has been moved from
    b2i_PVK_bio_ex() into the legacy crypto provider as an

    could be suppressed if the undocumented -DI_CAN_LIVE_WITH_LNK4049
    was set. Support for this flag has been removed.
  * Rework and make DEBUG macros consistent. Remove unused

    deprecated. They will be made opaque in a future release.
  * Many functions in the EVP_ namespace that are getters of values
    from implementations or contexts were renamed to include get or
    get0 in their names. Old names are provided as macro aliases for
    compatibility and are not deprecated.
  * PKCS#5 PBKDF1 key derivation has been moved from PKCS5_PBE_keyivgen()
    into the legacy crypto provider as an EVP_KDF. Applications requiring
    this KDF will need to load the legacy crypto provider. This includes
    these PBE algorithms which use this KDF:
     - NID_pbeWithMD2AndDES_CBC     - NID_pbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC
     - NID_pbeWithSHA1AndRC2_CBC    - NID_pbeWithMD2AndRC2_CBC
     - NID_pbeWithMD5AndRC2_CBC     - NID_pbeWithSHA1AndDES_CBC
  * Deprecated obsolete BIO_set_callback(), BIO_get_callback(), and
    BIO_debug_callback() functions.
- Fix build on ppc and ppc64
  * Add openssl-ppc64-fix-build.patch
  * See https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/15923

Fri Jun 11 13:17:54 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 17
  * Added migration guide to man7
  * Implemented support for fully "pluggable" TLSv1.3 groups
  * Added convenience functions for generating asymmetric key pairs.
  * Added a proper HTTP client supporting GET with optional redirection,
    POST, arbitrary request and response content types, TLS, persistent
    connections, connections via HTTP(s) proxies, connections and
    exchange via user-defined BIOs (allowing implicit connections), and
    timeout checks.

Mon May 10 02:13:06 UTC 2021 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0. Alpha 16
  * Mark pop/clear error stack in der2key_decode_p8

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  1 19:58:48 UTC 2021 - Jason Sikes <jsikes@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 15
  * The default manual page suffix ($MANSUFFIX) has been changed to "ossl"
  * Added support for Kernel TLS (KTLS). In order to use KTLS, support for it
    must be compiled in using the "enable-ktls" compile time option. It must
    also be enabled at run time using the SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS option.
  * The error return values from some control calls (ctrl) have changed.
    One significant change is that controls which used to return -2 for
    invalid inputs, now return -1 indicating a generic error condition instead.
  * Removed EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type().
  * All of these low level RSA functions have been deprecated without
    replacement:
    RSA_blinding_off, RSA_blinding_on, RSA_clear_flags, RSA_get_version,
    RSAPrivateKey_dup, RSAPublicKey_dup, RSA_set_flags, RSA_setup_blinding and
    RSA_test_flags.
  * All of these RSA flags have been deprecated without replacement:
    RSA_FLAG_BLINDING, RSA_FLAG_CACHE_PRIVATE, RSA_FLAG_CACHE_PUBLIC,
    RSA_FLAG_EXT_PKEY, RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING, RSA_FLAG_THREAD_SAFE and
    RSA_METHOD_FLAG_NO_CHECK.
  * These low level DH functions have been deprecated without replacement:
    DH_clear_flags, DH_get_1024_160, DH_get_2048_224, DH_get_2048_256,
    DH_set_flags and DH_test_flags.
    The DH_FLAG_CACHE_MONT_P flag has been deprecated without replacement.
    The DH_FLAG_TYPE_DH and DH_FLAG_TYPE_DHX have been deprecated.  Use
    EVP_PKEY_is_a() to determine the type of a key.  There is no replacement for
    setting these flags.
  * These low level DSA functions have been deprecated without replacement:
    DSA_clear_flags, DSA_dup_DH, DSAparams_dup, DSA_set_flags and
    DSA_test_flags.
  * The DSA_FLAG_CACHE_MONT_P flag has been deprecated without replacement.
  * Reworked the treatment of EC EVP_PKEYs with the SM2 curve to
    automatically become EVP_PKEY_SM2 rather than EVP_PKEY_EC. This is a breaking
    change from previous OpenSSL versions.
    Unlike in previous OpenSSL versions, this means that applications must not
    call 'EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type(pkey, EVP_PKEY_SM2)' to get SM2 computations.
    The 'EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type' function has now been removed.
  * Parameter and key generation is also reworked to make it possible
    to generate EVP_PKEY_SM2 parameters and keys. Applications must now generate
    SM2 keys directly and must not create an EVP_PKEY_EC key first.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 19 12:35:57 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 14
  * A public key check is now performed during EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer().
    Previously DH was internally doing this during EVP_PKEY_derive().
  * The EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_ENCRYPT, EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_DECRYPT,
    EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_SIGN, EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_ENCRYPT,
    EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_DECRYPT, and EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_SIGN control operations
    are deprecated. They are not invoked by the OpenSSL library anymore and
    are replaced by direct checks of the key operation against the key type
    when the operation is initialized.
  * The EVP_PKEY_public_check() and EVP_PKEY_param_check() functions now work for
    more key types including RSA, DSA, ED25519, X25519, ED448 and X448.
    Previously (in 1.1.1) they would return -2. For key types that do not have
    parameters then EVP_PKEY_param_check() will always return 1.
  * The output from numerous "printing" functions such as X509_signature_print(),
    X509_print_ex(), X509_CRL_print_ex(), and other similar functions has been
    amended such that there may be cosmetic differences between the output
    observed in 1.1.1 and 3.0. This also applies to the "-text" output from the
    x509 and crl applications.
  * Improved adherence to Enhanced Security Services (ESS, RFC 2634 and RFC 5035)
    for the TSP and CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES) implementations.
    As required by RFC 5035 check both ESSCertID and ESSCertIDv2 if both present.
    Correct the semantics of checking the validation chain in case ESSCertID{,v2}
    contains more than one certificate identifier: This means that all
    certificates referenced there MUST be part of the validation chain.
  * Parallel dual-prime 1024-bit modular exponentiation for AVX512_IFMA
    capable processors.
  * Added the AuthEnvelopedData content type structure (RFC 5083) with AES-GCM
    parameter (RFC 5084) for the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). Its purpose
    is to support encryption and decryption of a digital envelope that is both
    authenticated and encrypted using AES GCM mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 14 17:55:21 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 13
  * A public key check is now performed during EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer().
    Previously DH was internally doing this during EVP_PKEY_derive().
    To disable this check use EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer_ex(dh, peer, 0). This
    may mean that an error can occur in EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer() rather than
    during EVP_PKEY_derive().
  * The EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_ENCRYPT, EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_DECRYPT,
    EVP_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_SIGN, EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_ENCRYPT,
    EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_DECRYPT, and EVP_PKEY_CTRL_CMS_SIGN control operations
    are deprecated. They are not invoked by the OpenSSL library anymore and
    are replaced by direct checks of the key operation against the key type
    when the operation is initialized.
  * The EVP_PKEY_public_check() and EVP_PKEY_param_check() functions now work for
    more key types including RSA, DSA, ED25519, X25519, ED448 and X448.
    Previously (in 1.1.1) they would return -2. For key types that do not have
    parameters then EVP_PKEY_param_check() will always return 1.

    authenticated and encrypted using AES GCM mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 19 08:58:35 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 12
  * The SRP APIs have been deprecated. The old APIs do not work via
    providers, and there is no EVP interface to them. Unfortunately
    there is no replacement for these APIs at this time.
  * Add a compile time option to prevent the caching of provider
    fetched algorithms. This is enabled by including the
    no-cached-fetch option at configuration time.
  * Combining the Configure options no-ec and no-dh no longer
    disables TLSv1.3. Typically if OpenSSL has no EC or DH algorithms
    then it cannot support connections with TLSv1.3. However OpenSSL
    now supports "pluggable" groups through providers.
  * The undocumented function X509_certificate_type() has been
    deprecated; applications can use X509_get0_pubkey() and
    X509_get0_signature() to get the same information.
  * Deprecated the obsolete BN_pseudo_rand() and BN_pseudo_rand_range()
    functions. They are identical to BN_rand() and BN_rand_range()
    respectively.
  * The default key generation method for the regular 2-prime RSA keys
    was changed to the FIPS 186-4 B.3.6 method (Generation of Probable
    Primes with Conditions Based on Auxiliary Probable Primes). This
    method is slower than the original method.
  * Deprecated the BN_is_prime_ex() and BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex()
    functions. They are replaced with the BN_check_prime() function
    that avoids possible misuse and always uses at least 64 rounds of
    the Miller-Rabin primality test.
  * Deprecated EVP_MD_CTX_set_update_fn() and EVP_MD_CTX_update_fn()
    as they are not useful with non-deprecated functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 12 11:47:35 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 11
  * Deprecated the obsolete X9.31 RSA key generation related
    functions BN_X931_generate_Xpq(), BN_X931_derive_prime_ex(),
    and BN_X931_generate_prime_ex().
  * Deprecated the type OCSP_REQ_CTX and the functions OCSP_REQ_CTX_*().
    These were used to collect all necessary data to form a HTTP
    request, and to perform the HTTP transfer with that request.
    With OpenSSL 3.0, the type is OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX, and the
    deprecated functions are replaced with OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_*().
  * Validation of SM2 keys has been separated from the validation of
    regular EC keys, allowing to improve the SM2 validation process
    to reject loaded private keys that are not conforming to the SM2
    ISO standard. In particular, a private scalar 'k' outside the
    range '1 <= k < n-1' is now correctly rejected.
  * Behavior of the 'pkey' app is changed, when using the '-check'
    or '-pubcheck' switches: a validation failure triggers an early
    exit, returning a failure exit status to the parent process.
  * Changed behavior of SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites() and
    SSL_set_ciphersuites() to ignore unknown ciphers.
  * All of the low level EC_KEY functions have been deprecated.
  * Functions that read and write EC_KEY objects and that assign or
    obtain EC_KEY objects from an EVP_PKEY are also deprecated.
  * Added the '-copy_extensions' option to the 'x509' command for use
    with '-req' and '-x509toreq'. When given with the 'copy' or
    'copyall' argument, all extensions in the request are copied to
    the certificate or vice versa.
  * Added the '-copy_extensions' option to the 'req' command for use
    with '-x509'. When given with the 'copy' or 'copyall' argument,
    all extensions in the certification request are copied to the
    certificate.
  * The 'x509', 'req', and 'ca' commands now make sure that X.509v3
    certificates they generate are by default RFC 5280 compliant in
    the following sense: There is a subjectKeyIdentifier extension
    with a hash value of the public key and for not self-signed certs
    there is an authorityKeyIdentifier extension with a keyIdentifier
    field or issuer information identifying the signing key. This is
    done unless some configuration overrides the new default behavior,
    such as 'subjectKeyIdentifier = none' and 'authorityKeyIdentifier
    = none'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan  9 10:05:06 UTC 2021 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 10 (CVE-2020-1971)
  * See full changelog: www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html
  * Fixed NULL pointer deref in the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function
    This function could crash if both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an
    EDIPARTYNAME. If an attacker can control both items being
    compared then this could lead to a possible denial of service
    attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for
    two purposes:
    1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available
       CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate
    2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches
       the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions
       TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token)
  * The -cipher-commands and -digest-commands options of the
    command line utility list has been deprecated. Instead use
    the -cipher-algorithms and -digest-algorithms options.
  * Additionally functions that read and write DH objects such as
    d2i_DHparams, i2d_DHparams, PEM_read_DHparam, PEM_write_DHparams
    and other similar functions have also been deprecated.
    Applications should instead use the OSSL_DECODER and OSSL_ENCODER
    APIs to read and write DH files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 17 09:26:56 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 9
  * See also https://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html
  * Deprecated all the libcrypto and libssl error string loading
    functions. Calling these functions is not necessary since
    OpenSSL 1.1.0, as OpenSSL now loads error strings automatically.
  * The functions SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback, as
    well as the macros SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh() and SSL_set_tmp_dh() have been
    deprecated. These are used to set the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters that
    are to be used by servers requiring ephemeral DH keys. Instead applications
    should consider using the built-in DH parameters that are available by
    calling SSL_CTX_set_dh_auto() or SSL_set_dh_auto().
  * The -crypt option to the passwd command line tool has been removed.
  * The -C option to the x509, dhparam, dsaparam, and ecparam commands
    has been removed.
  * Added several checks to X509_verify_cert() according to requirements in
    RFC 5280 in case 'X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT' is set (which may be done by
    using the CLI option '-x509_strict'):
    - The basicConstraints of CA certificates must be marked critical.
    - CA certificates must explicitly include the keyUsage extension.
    - If a pathlenConstraint is given the key usage keyCertSign must be allowed.
    - The issuer name of any certificate must not be empty.
    - The subject name of CA certs, certs with keyUsage crlSign,
      and certs without subjectAlternativeName must not be empty.
    - If a subjectAlternativeName extension is given it must not be empty.
    - The signatureAlgorithm field and the cert signature must be consistent.
    - Any given authorityKeyIdentifier and any given subjectKeyIdentifier
      must not be marked critical.
    - The authorityKeyIdentifier must be given for X.509v3 certs
      unless they are self-signed.
    - The subjectKeyIdentifier must be given for all X.509v3 CA certs.
  * Certificate verification using X509_verify_cert() meanwhile rejects EC keys
    with explicit curve parameters (specifiedCurve) as required by RFC 5480.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  5 18:36:23 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 8
  * Add support for AES Key Wrap inverse ciphers to the EVP layer.
    The algorithms are: "AES-128-WRAP-INV", "AES-192-WRAP-INV",
    "AES-256-WRAP-INV", "AES-128-WRAP-PAD-INV", "AES-192-WRAP-PAD-INV"
    and "AES-256-WRAP-PAD-INV". The inverse ciphers use AES decryption
    for wrapping, and AES encryption for unwrapping.
  * Deprecated EVP_PKEY_set1_tls_encodedpoint() and
    EVP_PKEY_get1_tls_encodedpoint(). These functions were previously
    used by libssl to set or get an encoded public key in/from an
    EVP_PKEY object. With OpenSSL 3.0 these are replaced by the more
    generic functions EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() and
    EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key(). The old versions have been
    converted to deprecated macros that just call the new functions.
  * The security callback, which can be customised by application
    code, supports the security operation SSL_SECOP_TMP_DH. This is
    defined to take an EVP_PKEY in the "other" parameter. In most
    places this is what is passed. All these places occur server side.
    However there was one client side call of this security operation
    and it passed a DH object instead. This is incorrect according to
    the definition of SSL_SECOP_TMP_DH, and is inconsistent with all
    of the other locations. Therefore this client side call has been
    changed to pass an EVP_PKEY instead.
  * Added new option for 'openssl list', '-providers', which will
    display the list of loaded providers, their names, version and
    status. It optionally displays their gettable parameters.
  * Deprecated pthread fork support methods. These were unused so no
    replacement is required. OPENSSL_fork_prepare(),
    OPENSSL_fork_parent() and OPENSSL_fork_child().
- Remove openssl-AES_XTS.patch fixed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 10:58:53 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Fix build on ppc* architectures
  * Fix tests failing: 30-test_acvp.t and 30-test_evp.t
  * https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13133
- Add openssl-AES_XTS.patch for ppc64, ppc64le and aarch64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 08:43:10 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Re-enable test 81-test_cmp_cli.t fixed upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 15 16:44:44 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 7
  * Add PKCS7_get_octet_string() and PKCS7_type_is_other() to the public
    interface. Their functionality remains unchanged.
  * Deprecated EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type(). This function was previously
    needed as a workaround to recognise SM2 keys. With OpenSSL 3.0, this key
    type is internally recognised so the workaround is no longer needed.
  * Deprecated EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_pubexp() & introduced
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_rsa_keygen_pubexp(), which is now preferred.
  * Changed all "STACK" functions to be macros instead of inline functions.
    Macro parameters are still checked for type safety at compile time via
    helper inline functions.
  * Remove the RAND_DRBG API:
    The RAND_DRBG API did not fit well into the new provider concept as
    implemented by EVP_RAND and EVP_RAND_CTX. The main reason is that the
    RAND_DRBG API is a mixture of 'front end' and 'back end' API calls
    and some of its API calls are rather low-level. This holds in particular
    for the callback mechanism (RAND_DRBG_set_callbacks()).
    Adding a compatibility layer to continue supporting the RAND_DRBG API as
    a legacy API for a regular deprecation period turned out to come at the
    price of complicating the new provider API unnecessarily. Since the
    RAND_DRBG API exists only since version 1.1.1, it was decided by the OMC
    to drop it entirely.
  * Added the options '-crl_lastupdate' and '-crl_nextupdate' to 'openssl ca',
    allowing the 'lastUpdate' and 'nextUpdate' fields in the generated CRL to
    be set explicitly.
  * 'PKCS12_parse' now maintains the order of the parsed certificates
    when outputting them via '*ca' (rather than reversing it).
- Update openssl-DEFAULT_SUSE_cipher.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  7 14:42:42 UTC 2020 - Callum Farmer <callumjfarmer13@gmail.com>

- Removed 0001-Fix-typo-for-SSL_get_peer_certificate.patch:
  contained in upstream.
- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 6
  * Added util/check-format.pl for checking adherence to the coding guidelines.
  * Allow SSL_set1_host() and SSL_add1_host() to take IP literal addresses
   as well as actual hostnames.
  * The 'MinProtocol' and 'MaxProtocol' configuration commands now silently
   ignore TLS protocol version bounds when configuring DTLS-based contexts, and
   conversely, silently ignore DTLS protocol version bounds when configuring
   TLS-based contexts.  The commands can be repeated to set bounds of both
   types.  The same applies with the corresponding "min_protocol" and
   "max_protocol" command-line switches, in case some application uses both TLS
   and DTLS. SSL_CTX instances that are created for a fixed protocol version (e.g.
   TLSv1_server_method()) also silently ignore version bounds.  Previously
   attempts to apply bounds to these protocol versions would result in an
   error.  Now only the "version-flexible" SSL_CTX instances are subject to
   limits in configuration files in command-line options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 08:40:26 UTC 2020 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Fix linking when the deprecated SSL_get_per_certificate() is in use
  * https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/12468
  * add 0001-Fix-typo-for-SSL_get_peer_certificate.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 17 08:34:45 UTC 2020 - Pedro Monreal Gonzalez <pmonrealgonzalez@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 5
  * Deprecated the 'ENGINE' API. Engines should be replaced with
    providers going forward.
  * Reworked the recorded ERR codes to make better space for system errors.
    To distinguish them, the macro 'ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR()' indicates
    if the given code is a system error (true) or an OpenSSL error (false).
  * Reworked the test perl framework to better allow parallel testing.
  * Added ciphertext stealing algorithms AES-128-CBC-CTS, AES-192-CBC-CTS and
    AES-256-CBC-CTS to the providers. CS1, CS2 and CS3 variants are supported.
  * 'Configure' has been changed to figure out the configuration target if
    none is given on the command line. Consequently, the 'config' script is
    now only a mere wrapper. All documentation is changed to only mention
    'Configure'.
  * Added a library context that applications as well as other libraries can use
    to form a separate context within which libcrypto operations are performed.
    - There are two ways this can be used:
      1) Directly, by passing a library context to functions that take
         such an argument, such as 'EVP_CIPHER_fetch' and similar algorithm
         fetching functions.
      2) Indirectly, by creating a new library context and then assigning
         it as the new default, with 'OPENSSL_CTX_set0_default'.
    - All public OpenSSL functions that take an 'OPENSSL_CTX' pointer,
      apart from the functions directly related to 'OPENSSL_CTX', accept
      NULL to indicate that the default library context should be used.
    - Library code that changes the default library context using
      'OPENSSL_CTX_set0_default' should take care to restore it with a
      second call before returning to the caller.
  * The security strength of SHA1 and MD5 based signatures in TLS has been
    reduced. This results in SSL 3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and DTLS 1.0 no longer
    working at the default security level of 1 and instead requires security
    level 0. The security level can be changed either using the cipher string
    with @SECLEVEL, or calling SSL_CTX_set_security_level().
  * The SSL option SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT is introduced. If that option is
    set, openssl cleanses (zeroize) plaintext bytes from internal buffers
    after delivering them to the application. Note, the application is still
    responsible for cleansing other copies (e.g.: data received by SSL_read(3)).
- Update openssl-ppc64-config.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 26 07:20:40 UTC 2020 - Vítězslav Čížek <vcizek@suse.com>

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 4
  * general improvements to the built-in providers, the providers API and the internal plumbing and the provider-aware mechanisms for libssl

- Update to 3.0.0 Alpha 3
  * general improvements to the built-in providers, the providers API and the internal plumbing and the provider-aware mechanisms for libssl;
  * general improvements and fixes in the CLI apps;
  * cleanup of the EC API:
    EC_METHOD became an internal-only concept, and functions using or returning EC_METHOD arguments have been deprecated;
    EC_POINT_make_affine() and EC_POINTs_make_affine() have been deprecated in favor of automatic internal handling of conversions when needed;
    EC_GROUP_precompute_mult(), EC_GROUP_have_precompute_mult(), and EC_KEY_precompute_mult() have been deprecated, as such precomputation data is now rarely used;
    EC_POINTs_mul() has been deprecated, as for cryptographic applications EC_POINT_mul() is enough.
  * the CMS API got support for CAdES-BES signature verification;
  * introduction of a new SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF option;
  * improvements to the RSA OAEP support;
  * FFDH support in the speed app;
  * CI: added external testing through the GOST engine;
  * fixes for various issues;
  * extended and improved test coverage;
  * additions and improvements to the documentations.

- Initial packaging 3.0.0 Alpha 1
  * Major Release
    OpenSSL 3.0 is a major release and consequently any application
    that currently uses an older version of OpenSSL will at the
    very least need to be recompiled in order to work with the new version.
    It is the intention that the large majority of applications will
    work unchanged with OpenSSL 3.0 if those applications previously
    worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1. However this is not guaranteed and
    some changes may be required in some cases.
  * Providers and FIPS support
    Providers collect together and make available algorithm implementations.
    With OpenSSL 3.0 it is possible to specify, either programmatically
    or via a config file, which providers you want to use for any given application
  * Low Level APIs
    Use of the low level APIs have been deprecated.
  * Legacy Algorithms
    Some cryptographic algorithms that were available via the EVP APIs
    are now considered legacy and their use is strongly discouraged.
    These legacy EVP algorithms are still available in OpenSSL 3.0 but not by default.
    If you want to use them then you must load the legacy provider.
  * Engines and "METHOD" APIs
    The ENGINE API and any function that creates or modifies custom "METHODS"
    are being deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0
    Authors and maintainers of external engines are strongly encouraged to
    refactor their code transforming engines into providers using
    the new Provider API and avoiding deprecated methods.
  * Versioning Scheme
    The OpenSSL versioning scheme has changed with the 3.0 release.
    The new versioning scheme has this format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
    The patch level is indicated by the third number instead of a letter
    at the end of the release version number.
    A change in the second (MINOR) number indicates that new features may have been added.
    OpenSSL versions with the same major number are API and ABI compatible.
    If the major number changes then API and ABI compatibility is not guaranteed.
  * Other major new features
    Implementation of the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP, RFC 4210)
    also covering CRMF (RFC 4211) and HTTP transfer (RFC 6712).
    A proper HTTP(S) client in libcrypto supporting GET and POST,
    redirection, plain and ASN.1-encoded contents, proxies, and timeouts
    EVP_KDF APIs have been introduced for working with Key Derivation Functions
    EVP_MAC APIs have been introduced for working with MACs
    Support for Linux Kernel TLS
