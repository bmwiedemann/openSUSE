  <title>VPN adapter for Tor and I2P</title>
  <description>OnionCat creates a transparent IP layer on top of Tor's hidden services. It
transmits any kind of IP-based data transparently through the Tor network on a
location hidden basis. You can think of it as a point-to-multipoint VPN between
hidden services.
