- Update to Version 6.2.1 - September 30, 2019
    Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a crash that arose from an inadvertent ABI change of an I/O class
      with the 6.2.0 release.  The crash occured when attempting to write out
      a point data grid using an I/O routine from a different version of
      OpenVDB than the one with which the grid was authored and when
      one of those OpenVDB versions was 6.2.0.

- Update to Version 6.2.0 - September 18, 2019
    New features:
    - Added tools::FindActiveValues, which counts the active values
      in a tree that intersect a given bounding box.
    - Added io::DelayedLoadMetadata, which stores mask offsets and compression
      sizes on write to accelerate delayed load reading.
    Improvements:
    - LeafNode::modifyValue() and LeafNode::modifyValueAndActiveState()
      now modify voxel values in place for improved performance.
    - Added math::isInfinite() and math::isNan() to resolve Visual Studio
      compatibility issues with integer types.
    - Made minor performance improvements to moving and filtering VDB points.
    - Improved performance related to a mutex contention when appending
      multiple AttributeArrays in parallel through various point operations.
    - Significantly improved the performance of createLevelSetSphere()
      using threading.
    - Improved directory and file path lookups of some CMake commands in
      the root CMakeLists.txt

    - Improved CMake support for GLFW versions 3.1 and later.
    - FindOpenVDB.cmake now correctly propagates CXX version requirements.
    - Added CMake support for linking against Jemalloc and TBB malloc
      and enabled Jemalloc by default for Linux and non-Maya builds
      and TBB malloc for all other builds.
    - Added a USE_COLORED_OUTPUT option to CMake to display compiler output
      in color.
    - Added an OPENVDB_CODE_COVERAGE option to CMake.
    - CMake now automatically detects and configures the CXX11 ABI requirement
      for Houdini builds.
    - CMake now issues deprecation warnings for 2017 VFX Reference Platform
      version dependencies. In particular, C++11-only compilers are now
      deprecated; OpenVDB 7.0 will require a C++14-compatible compiler.
    Bug fixes:
    - Replaced std::vector with std::deque as the underlying container
      for util::PagedArray, to address a rare crash when reading
      from multiple threads while writing from another thread.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an empty CoordBBox to report nonzero volume.
    - Fixed a bug in tools::computeScalarPotential() that could produce
      a corrupt result due to invalid memory access.
      [Reported by Edwin Braun]
    - Partially reverted tools::ClosestSurfacePoint's distance calculations
      to their pre-OpenVDB 5.0 behavior to address a bug in the
      fillWithSpheres() tool that caused generated spheres to sometimes
      extend outside the target volume.
    - CMake now correctly sets rpaths for the unit test binary.
    - Addressed a Valgrind warning by allocating the AttributeArray registry
      using a Meyers singleton.

    ABI changes:
    - ABI versions 3 and older are now deprecated, and support for them will be
      removed in a future release. Until then, define the macro
      OPENVDB_USE_DEPRECATED_ABI (or set the CMake OPENVDB_USE_DEPRECATED_ABI
      option to ON) to suppress deprecation messages when compiling OpenVDB or
      dependent code.
    API changes:
    - Changed points::RandomLeafFilter::LeafMap from a std::map to
      a std::unordered_map.
    - Removed the TableT template argument from util::PagedArray.
      The table type is now hardcoded to std::deque.
    - The minimum supported version of GLFW is now 3.1.
    Python:
    - CMake now always produces a .so for the Python module on Unix
      and Linux platforms.
    - Fixed a compile-time error when building the Python module for Python 3.

    Houdini:
    - OpenVDB SOPs are now displayed in an ASWF sub-menu of the VDB tab menu.
    - Added API documentation and examples.
    - Added openvdb_houdini::GEOvdbApply(), which invokes a functor
      on a VDB primitive if the resolved grid type is a member of
      a given type list.
    - Fixed a regression in the Fill SOP that caused it to modify VDBs
      in the input detail.
    - The Combine SOP no longer crashes in Copy B mode when the destination
      is not a VDB.
    - Added a houdini_utils::OpFactory::addSpareData() method
      and addOperatorSpareData() and getOperatorSpareData() functions
      to manage spare data associated with operator types.
    - Added an opsparedata HScript command and hou.NodeType.spareData()
      and hou.NodeType.spareDataDict() methods to retrieve spare data
      associated with operator types.
    - Added a pythonrc.py startup script to set the tab menu visibility
      of nodes and their native Houdini equivalents, based on an
      OPENVDB_OPHIDE_POLICY environment variable.
    - Added a houdini_utils::OpFactory::setInvisible() method to hide nodes
      from tab menus.
    - Added an OpenVDBOpFactory::setNativeName() method to pair OpenVDB nodes
      with their native Houdini equivalents.
    - Added a houdini_utils::OpPolicy::getTabSubMenuPath() method to allow
      OpPolicy subclasses to provide their own tab sub-menu path.
    - OpenVDB nodes now override OP_Operator::getVersion() to return
      a version string of the form "vdb6.2.0 houdini18.0.222".

- Clean up spec file, remove superfluous parameterization

- Replace cmake(TBB) BuildRequires with equivalent tbb-devel, the
  latter is also available on Leap 15.x.

- Trim bias and metadata redundancies from description.
- Then openSUSE %ix86 platforms are not guaranteed to have SSE.
