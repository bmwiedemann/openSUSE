Thu Jul 30 19:26:15 UTC 2015 - trcs@gmx.com

- update to 3.6.1:
  * Bump ABI version of libobrender that should have been done in
    3.6
  * Added various new abilities to If action, including the <query>
    tag, matching class, name, role and window type.
  * Added ForEach action.
  * Restore the <center> option for window placement.
  * New GrowToFill action.
  * Updated Portuguese and Polish translations.
  * New Galician translation.
  * Added strict option to ToggleShowDesktop action.
  * Speed optimization in rendering code.
  * New <position> tag for ShowMenu action allows placing menus
    other than at the mouse cursor.
  * Fix some corner cases of relative position to work correctly.
  * Allow specifying multiple mousebinds in one tag as we already
    do for keybinds (separated by spaces, as "W-Return M-S-F3" for
    example).
  * Added option rebindOnMappingNotify option, on by default, which
    controls if we update binds when the keyboard layout changes at
    runtime.
  * The resize action now only considers the part of the client
    that is onscreen for purposes of picking an action to perform.
  * Make desktop actions non-interactive (means you can have more
    actions bound to a key after them, and the dialog disappears on
    a timer instead of when releasing the modifier keys).
  * obxprop is now not pathologically slow when printing very long
    arrays.
  * Fix menu accelerator underlines sometimes not showing up.
  * Fix so you can click menu entries before the menuHideDelay
    expires if it's a new click.
  * Don't readd the X event fd to the poll set every time we
    reconfigure.
  * Fix some specialized button bitmaps not loading from the
    correct files. (toggled + pressed or hover would just be the
    base toggled image).
  * Various small bugfixes.
- spec file clean-up
  * removed unnecessary Requires: libxslt-tools
  * removed unnecessary %clean section
- Removed unnecessary patch:
  * openbox-3.5-2-toggled_hover-toggled_pressed-bitmaps-ignored.patch

Mon Oct  6 17:01:56 UTC 2014 - hrvoje.senjan@gmail.com

- Fixup previous changes: explicitly add pkgconfig(sm), pkgconfig(ice)
  and pkgconfig(x11), otherwise packages linking against obrender
  fail unless they also require those libraries for themselves.
  The are not picked up by dependancy generator, as they are hidden
  behind a var and added to Libs section

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 24 02:25:13 UTC 2014 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- In the previous change I forgot to remove xorg-x11-devel 
  from the -devel package requires. Remove *all* hardcoded
  deps of that package and let pkgconfig dependency generator
  pick the correct packages for us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 15 20:44:30 UTC 2014 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- Cleanup BuildRequires so only exactly what is required is 
  pulled for build, in particular avoid using metapackage 
  xorg-x11-dev.
- Enable verbose build.
- Use --disable-static instead of just removing the libraries.
- removed unused openbox-no_nb.patch patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 10 13:20:51 UTC 2014 - mq@suse.com

  * Allow application rules to pick a monitor for new windows without forcing
    a position.
  * Allow non-interactive focus cycling with a new <interactive> tag.
  * New LeastOverlap window placement policy replaces the old default
    behaviour. It finds a place on a given monitor that overlaps as few
    windows as possible. Contributed by Ian Zimmerman.
  * Improved Xinerama behaviour.
  * Correctly interface with latest gnome-session for Gnome/Openbox X sessions.
  * Allow third-party control of window opacity in compositing managers.

- new upstream version 0.4.11
    * Update Hungarian, Japanese, and Latvian translations.
    * Make xdg-autostart use the OPENBOX environment by default,

      something.
    * Fix bug #4503 (Adjust who shows up in the Alt-Tab list
      using SKIP_TASKBAR).

      monitors of different sizes.
    * Fix bug #4355 (Allow multiple escaped _'s in a menu label

    * Improve keyboard navigation in Openbox menus.
    * Add a --root option and a manpage for obxprop.

      submenuHideDelay config file option, under the "menu" section.
    * Fixed bug #4464 (Typo in openbox-gnome-session script).

      E.g. two keys which are both bound to Escape.

      properties) off of a window.
    * Add _OB_ROLE, _OB_NAME, and _OB_CLASS hints on each window that
      show the respective values for use in the rc.xml applications
      section, to modify the window when it appears.
    * Improve Openbox interoperability with gnome-session >= 2.24.

      monitor edges for multi-monitor setups.

Fri May  2 19:48:25 CEST 2008 - bwalle@suse.de

- update to 3.4.7.2
  o fix empty manpages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 19 22:36:11 CEST 2008 - bwalle@suse.de

- drop openbox-menu.patch
- update to 3.4.7.1
  o Not to be outdone by the cairo team, I introduced a bug in the
    last release which made resizing not give any feedback. This is
    now fixed. 
  o Fully updated Czech, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
    German, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, Vietnamese, Dutch, Swedish,
    Finnish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese and Portuguese
    translations
  o Partially updated Spanish translation
  o Add an example of the "force" option for the per-app placement
    options to the default rc.xml file
  o Add a new xdg-autostart script. This will eventually end up in
    the PyXDG distribution hopefully, but it is included in Openbox
    for now. This script runs things based on the freedesktop.org
    autostart specification. You can have it run GNOME, KDE, ROX,
    or XFCE specific things if you want. The new default
    system-wide autostart.sh script runs it automatically
  o Update the default menu.xml to include a lot of common apps
  o Fix white font shadows (negative shadowtint)
  o Update the autostart.sh to find gnome-settings-daemon
    correctly, as the GNOME people have moved it to libexec
  o Fix focus possibly getting stolen when using the Focus action
  o Drastically speed up rendering of Vertical and SplitVertical
    gradients
  o Speed improvements also for Horizonal and Pyramid gradients
  o Add new theme options, menu.overlap.x and menu.overlap.y
    options, that let you independently control the horizontal and
    vertical position of submenus
  o Change _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages to not change the current
    desktop, but to bring the window to the current desktop instead.
    This is the industry standard policy
  o Use the pretty new openbox.png icon as the default window icon
  o Allow matching per-application rules to windows by their window
    type (normal, dialog, splash, etc). The default rc.xml has more
    details
  o Add new Openbox-themed prompt windows. Use these prompt windows
    to ask before killing off windows that aren't responding. This
    also means we don't need to ping every window constantly forever
  o Add a new <prompt> option to the Execute action. If this is set
    to a string, a dialog will be shown with that string in it and
    "yes"/"no" buttons. The command to be executed will only be run
    if the user selects "yes" in the dialog
  o Add a new <prompt> option to the Exit action, which is a
    boolean (not a string). When true, Openbox will show a dialog
    confirming if you want to exit. The default is to show the prompt
  o Reduce Openbox's memory footprint and speed up rendering
    through the use of a new icon cache, so that Openbox only needs
    to keep 1 copy of an icon when 100 different windows share it
  o Make Openbox menus have the "menu type" hint for compositors to
    see and use
  o Fix the MoveResizeTo action for negative coords (opposite
    edges)
  o Fix key bindings getting lost if multiple bindings at the same
    level could not be translated (Fixes VMWare causing Openbox
    keybindings to stop working)
  o Fix the resize popup box for terminal windows with a base size
    of 0 (show the right size values for urxvt terminals)
  o Fix some off-by-one bugs with the edge growing/shrinking code
  o Add new theme options for menu line separators:
    menu.separator.color, menu.separator.width,
    menu.separator.padding.width, menu.separator.padding.height
  o Add xfce-mcs-manager to the default autostart.sh, and run it
    automatically when gnome-settings-daemon is not present to have
    GTK apps inherit settings from the XFCE configuration tools
  o Make the send-to-desktop menu in the client-menu indicate which
    is the current desktop for omnipresent windows, and don't close
    it if just toggling omni-presence when ctrl-clicking
  o Add a new SessionLogout action that logs out through the
    session manager, when running Openbox within a session manager
    such as within an GNOME/Openbox or KDE/Openbox session. The
    action includes a <prompt> option which is similar to the Exit
    action's
  o Add a new gdm-control command that lets you control gdm from
    within an X session. The gdm-control lets you change GDM's
    behaviour for when you end the current session. For instance,
    you can tell GDM to reboot, and then immediately log out of the
    current session, and the computer will be rebooted
  o Show an information dialog when an error occurs for Openbox,
    such as when the Execute action fails or when XML syntax errors
    are present in the configuration files
  o When making a window very narrow, don't draw buttons to the
    right of the title on top of the ones on its left. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  4 20:25:21 CEST 2008 - bwalle@suse.de

- update to 3.4.6.1
  o Updated Clearlooks theme 
  o Add the force="yes/no" option for the per-app settings'
    <position> tag 
  o Raise and focus modal children and their direct parents
    together, improved usability with direct modal transient
    windows 
  o Fix crash when using <raise> for NextWindow and there are no
    windows to move focus to 
  o Add the <manageDesktops> option in the rc.xml <menu> section,
    which toggles the "Manage Desktops" section appearing in the
    combined-client-list-menu 
  o Fix for menu headers showing the wrong text 
  o Fix for the <focusLast> behavior 
  o Treat modal direct children as one window with their parent
    consistently

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 16 15:24:34 CET 2008 - hvogel@suse.de

- Update to 3.4.5
  * Added Hungarian and Ukrainian translation

    or Shift-arrow in an interactive move
  * Make move and resize take the dock into account for resistance
  * Raise new windows when it makes sense, when they aren't being focused
  * Change default config to use click events for mouse wheel bindings instead
    of presses

    now only use the struts it needs to.  This can greatly improve
    xinerama functionality.
  * Fixes for how the dock is placed in certain positions on screen (off by 1
    errors)

    Size or Position
  * Rewrite of the actions subsystem
  * Removed deprecated actions:
    - ShowDesktop, UnshowDesktop (Use ToggleShowDesktop)
    - ResizeRelativeVert, ResizeRelativeHorz (Use ResizeRelative)
  * Switch desktops when moving a window and you drag it to the edge of the
    screen (added the <screenEdgeWarpTime> option for this)
  * Add actions to add/remove the last desktop in the client list menus
  * Use startup notification when launching ObConf in the default root menu
  * Fancy keyboard window moving:
    - Shift-arrow will move the window to the next edge
    - Arrow will move the window by a larger number of pixels
  * Fancy keyboard window resizing:
    - The first arrow will choose an edge to resize (then you can grow or
      shrink the window on that edge)
    - Hitting an arrow perpendicular to your selected edge will choose a
      different edge to resize
    - Shift-arrow will grow/shrink the window to the next edge
    - Control arrow will grow/shrink the window by only 1 pixel
    - Arrow will grow/shrink the window by a larger number of pixel
  * Timeout when synchronously resizing a window so you can still resize busy
    or dead application windows
  * Let you specify keyboard shortcuts in your root menus with _. Such as
    label="XTe_rm" would make 'r' the shortcut key.
  * Fixes for placing windows with per-app settings:
    - you can now place windows relative to any edge of the screen instead of
      only the top left. (-0 uses the far edge, +0 uses the near edge.  You can
      use --0 and +-0 to specify negative numbers.)
    - allow you to place windows partially outside of the screen
    - let per-app settings override program-specified positions (but not if it
      is user-specified)
  * Add user-specified margins to the configuration file
  * New preferred option for the Execute action is <command> instead of
    <execute> but the old one will still work.
  * Add new actions for controlling window decorations:
    - Decorate, Undecorate
  * Fix crash with very small windows

Mon Apr 19 15:35:06 CEST 2004 - mmj@suse.de

- Update to 3.2, including:
  o Added spanish and swedish translations
  o Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the
    actual number of the desktop
  o Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
  o the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all
    programs i've tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle
    the aspect internally anyway, this just makes sure you have
    black borders all the way to the edge. If this breaks
    anything for you, let me know.
  o Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an
    alias for Mod4
  o Added probably too many options and actions
  o ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
    doesn't save it to the config
  o keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when
    you toggleDecorations
  o added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
    move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of
    the config popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can
    be Always, Never or Nonpixel (this is the default).
  o Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus
    along the bottom edge, note that the default is true
  o warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the
    mouse cursor is to be warped by openbox when the menu moves
    to keep on screen to keep the cursor in the same place
    relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
  o Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens
    when you change desktops and have followMouse on)
  o Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you
    start openbox, firstdesk, for example you might like to set it
    to 5 if you have a 3x3 grid to start in the middle.
