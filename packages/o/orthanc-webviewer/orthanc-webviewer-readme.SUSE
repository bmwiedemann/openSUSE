README: Orthanc for openSUSE
============================

Orthanc is a RESTful DICOM server for healthcare and medical research.

This package provides the WebViewer plugin for Orthanc.

Once Orthanc is installed, you must add a section in the Orthanc configuration file that specifies the details of the Web Viewer. 

You may use /usr/share/doc/packages/orthanc/webviewer.json as template and copy it to /etc/orthanc.
You need to restart the Orthanc-Server to enable the configuration.

Note: If you have multiple plugins installed, make sure you have the line 

"Plugins" : [
    "/usr/share/orthanc/plugins/"
  ],

only ONCE in all .json files!

Have fun
