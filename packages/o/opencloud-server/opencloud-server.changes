Fri Aug 29 06:16:35 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 3.2.0:
  * Add dark mode and adjust light theme colors
    - This release introduces a new dark mode for improved
      accessibility and user experience in low-light environments.
      Additionally, the light theme color palette has been adjusted
      to align with the generated Material Design color guidelines,
      ensuring visual consistency and design compliance across the
      application.
  * New action "empty trash"
    - A new "Empty Trash" option is now available in the context
      menu of the trash overview. This action allows user to empty
      the trash of a selected space without navigating into it.
      This improvement streamlines the cleanup process for users
      managing multiple spaces.
  * Add fillstate for deleted files in trash overview page
    - The view feature "Show empty trash bins" has been added to
      the trash overview page. This allows users easily filter and
      focus on trash bins that still contain deleted files. This
      enhancement provides a cleaner and more targeted trash
      management experience.

Fri Aug 29 05:19:26 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 3.1.0:
  * Collabora: New “Export As” and “Save As” Options
    Working in Collabora just got more powerful:
    - Save As You can now save a copy of the current file directly
      from within Collabora.
    - Export As Export your currently edited document into another
      format (e.g. PDF) — no extra tools needed.
    These improvements let you convert and copy documents without
    ever leaving the editor.
  * Simplified "Open" Context Menu for Files
    The file context menu has been redesigned for a cleaner and
    more intuitive experience. A single "Open" entry replaces
    multiple "Open with..." options. This feature is fully
    accessible with keyboards.

Thu Aug 28 12:51:38 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 3.0.0:
  https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/releases/tag/v3.0.0
  Listing a Space took too long when it included many users.
  To improve performance in this scenario, the drive root
  permissions are no longer expanded automatically (#485).
  This change modifies the API behavior. In accordance with
  Semantic Versioning, we have incremented the major version
  number. No manual migrationsteps are neccesary.
  * Add Profile Photo
    Users can now upload a profile photo to personalize their
    account. The profile image will be displayed in the user
    interface wherever user avatars are shown such as the top bar
    and user lists enhancing recognition and adding a more personal
    touch.
  * Accessibility Improvement: Required Mark for Text Input Fields
    The text input component now includes a proper "required" mark
    for accessibility (a11y). This improves compliance with WCAG
    2.1 and overall form usability.
  * Delete Files Directly from Viewer or Editor
    You can now delete files directly from within an editor or
    viewer, without having to return to the file list. The delete
    option is available in the topbar context menu, the right
    sidebar action panel or the preview controls bar. Thanks to
    fwinn for proposing this improvement.
  * Calendar Integration URL Now Visible in Account Settings
    Users can now easily find their personal CalDAV calendar URL
    directly in the Web UI.
    New "Calendar" panel in the account settings (visible only if
    CalDAV is enabled by the server).
    Includes:
    - CalDAV URL (copyable)
    - Username (copyable)
    - Password info: use an app token for authentication
    This makes it easier to connect your OpenCloud calendar to
    third-party apps like Apple Calendar or Thunderbird.
  * Croping of Space Images
    Space managers can now select the visible area of a space image
    in a 16:9 aspect ratio. When uploading a space image, a crop
    tool lets you define the exact area shown in the space overview
    and details. Cropping is also completely controllable via
    keyboard.
  * Improved Design of the Account Page
    - The Account Page has been redesigned to offer a clearer
      structure and better usability.
  * Breaking changes
    - do not automatically expand drive root permissions [#495]
