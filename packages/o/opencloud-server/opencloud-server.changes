-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 15 08:10:32 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 4.0.0:
  https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/releases/tag/v4.0.0
  https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/maintenance/upgrade/upgrade-4.0.0
  * Highlights:
    - Multitenancy
      This release sets the foundation for multi tenant
      capabilities and provides a centralized platform with shared
      infrastructure and a logical separation between tenants. This
      means that users can only view and share files with users
      inside their own tenant. Configuration and administration are
      unified across the environment while shared services enable
      more efficient scaling. Multitenancy is ideal for
      organizations operating multiple units under one roof, such
      as agencies managing separate clients, enterprises with
      distinct business divisions or service providers hosting
      multiple customer environments.  Multitenancy is supported
      within the enterprise licence.
    - K8s - Kubernetes Helm Charts
      The new kubernetes helm charts ensure high availability for
      business critical deployments. Services now support stable,
      automated up and down scaling under load. The charts include
      built-in dashboards and alerts to spot issues early and keep
      environments easy to monitor. Heads up: The Helm charts are
      part of the enterprise licence and are different from the
      free, community driven Helm Charts.
    - Calendar and Contacts
      OpenCloud now supports an optional calendar and contacts
      service powered by Radicale, easily enabled as an addon. It
      works with standard CardDAV and CalDAV clients such as
      Thunderbird and common mobile apps. All data stays fully
      under your control with zero reliance on big tech providers.
      If enabled, users find their personal CalDAV calendar URL
      directly in the Web UI.
      - New "Calendar" panel in the account settings (visible only
        if CalDAV is enabled by the server).
      - Includes:
        - CalDAV URL (copyable)
        - Username (copyable)
        - Password info: use an app token for authentication
      The calendar integration was added thanks to frequent request
      from the community. For enterprise deployments, contact our
      Service and Support team. Learn more:
      https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/configuration/radicale-integration
    - PosixFS with Live File Updates
      PosixFS provides the single source of truth in OpenCloud,
      eliminating separate metadata and inconsistent states one
      encounters with classic database backed systems. Changes on
      the file level are now reflected live in OpenCloud, updating
      on all your clients in realtime whats going on within your
      storage file tree.
    - Enterprise Search Backend: OpenSearch
      OpenCloud now integrates with OpenSearch
      (https://opensearch.org/) as search service for indexing and
      querying. The OpenSearch integration provides cluster
      capabilities for high load scenarios. Full text queries run
      faster and more precisely through modern relevance models,
      backed by distributed indexing for high throughput. This
      allows administrators to use OpenSearch as a scalable,
      distributed search backend, while Bleve remains the default
      search engine for regular home- and family-setups. The
      OpenSearch integration is supported within the enterprise
      licence.
    - 1-Click Branding
      OpenCloud now generates a complete, accessible theme from a
      single primary color input covering buttons, navigation,
      states and more. Manual color configuration remains optional
      for advanced customization. The generated themes meet
      accessibility (BITV2.0 and WCAG2.1) requirements and ensure
      consistent branding across all tenants. 1-Klick branding ist
      included in the enterprise licence.
    - Undo Option
      Introduces an undo option for delete actions, giving users
      quick recovery from mistakes and encouraging safer
      experimentation. This lowers the barrier for cautious or less
      experienced users by enabling safe experimentation without
      fear of breaking anything.
    - Install the Web UI as PWA
      The OpenCloud Web UI can now be installed as a Progressive
      Web App directly from the browser. The PWA allow users to
      place an icon on the homescreen, desktop or taskbar for fast
      access. The web ui launches like a native application without
      a browser frame and the installation can be done without the
      need of an app store. The UI for installing a PWA depends on
      the browser and platform. On Safari for iOS, users install
      the PWA through the Add to Home Screen option. On Android
      browsers like Chrome, the install option appears in the
      browser menu. On desktop Firefox, Chrome and Edge, an install
      icon appears in the URL bar when the PWA is not yet
      installed.
    - Collabora automatic dark/light theme
      Integration is everything: Collabora now automatically adapts
      to your Dark or Light mode settings in OpenCloud. You no
      longer need to switch modes manually, making you feel right
      at “home” when working on documents. Everything looks
      seamless and makes working more effortless.
    - Tiles view on search result page
      OpenCloud allows the Tiles View on search result pages to be
      enabled as a global setting. This means the view is now
      available on every relevant page, including search results.
      The new view makes it easier to quickly identify and select
      documents or files. Search results are displayed visually in
      a clear, tile-based layout. With the global activation, the
      Tiles View is automatically applied across all relevant
      pages, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.
    - Calendar settings
      The Calendar settings are now easier to find: Application
      Switcher on the top left in the web ui. Note that the
      built-in Calendar needs to be enabled if you want to use it:
      https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/configuration/radicale-integration/
    - Update Check
      OpenCloud now includes an Update Check in the Web UI that
      checks if there is a new version available. The goal is to
      provide subtle update notifications without distracting you
      with banners or pop-ups. No personal user data is
      transmitted.  We deliver new features every three weeks as
      part of our rolling release cycle, and a new production
      release twice a year. The update check is fully optional and
      can be disabled at any time.
    - Use of css framework Tailwind
      The design system now fully uses Tailwind CSS, a modern
      utility-first framework that lets developers style components
      directly in the markup with pre-defined classes. This
      simplifies styling and ensures a consistent look across
      OpenCloud.
    - IDP Login Control
      OpenCloud now lets admins hide the login enable/disable
      option for users managed by an external IDP. This makes the
      user management interface clearer and easier to use.
    - Modernized context menu on mobile
      The context menu on mobile devices now features a drilldown
      design for submenus. This makes context actions more modern,
      intuitive, and optimized for smartphones. Additionally, the
      bottom drawer has been updated with a clearer, less technical
      label, improving usability for all users.
    - WebP support in preview
      The preview now supports the WebP image format: in addition
      to thumbnails in the file list and tiles view, clicking on a
      WebP file will now open it directly in the Preview app
      instead of downloading.
    - Add dark mode and adjust light theme colors
      This release introduces a new dark mode for improved
      accessibility and user experience in low-light environments.
      Additionally, the light theme color palette has been adjusted
      to align with the generated Material Design color guidelines,
      ensuring visual consistency and design compliance across the
      application.
    - New action "empty trash"
      A new "Empty Trash" option is now available in the context
      menu of the trash overview. This action allows user to empty
      the trash of a selected space without navigating into it.
      This improvement streamlines the cleanup process for users
      managing multiple spaces.
    - Add fillstate for deleted files in trash overview page
      The view feature "Show empty trash bins" has been added to
      the trash overview page. This allows users easily filter and
      focus on trash bins that still contain deleted files. This
      enhancement provides a cleaner and more targeted trash
      management experience.
    - Collabora: New “Export As” and “Save As” Options
      Working in Collabora just got more powerful:
      - Save As You can now save a copy of the current file
        directly from within Collabora.
      - Export As Export your currently edited document into
        another format (e.g. PDF) — no extra tools needed.
      These improvements let you convert and copy documents without
      ever leaving the editor.
    - Simplified "Open" Context Menu for Files
      The file context menu has been redesigned for a cleaner and
      more intuitive experience. A single "Open" entry replaces
      multiple "Open with..." options. This feature is fully
      accessible with keyboards.
    - Extended File Format Support in Text Editor
      The text editor now supports a wider range of text-based file
      formats:
      - Markup & Web: .html, .css, .scss, .sass, .less
      - Scripts & Code: .c, .cpp, .java, .sh, .bat, .asm, .ts, .tsx,
        .jsx, .vue
      - Config & Environment: .yml, .yaml, .toml, .ini, .conf, .env
      - Structured Data: .csv, .tsv, .xml
      - Other Text Formats: .log, .rtf, .ics, .dockerfile,
        .makefile
    - Add Profile Photo
      Users can now upload a profile photo to personalize their
      account. The profile image will be displayed in the user
      interface wherever user avatars are shown such as the top bar
      and user lists enhancing recognition and adding a more
      personal touch.
    - Accessibility Improvement: Required Mark for Text Input
      Fields
      The text input component now includes a proper "required"
      mark for accessibility (a11y). This improves compliance with
      WCAG 2.1 and overall form usability.
    - Delete Files Directly from Viewer or Editor
      You can now delete files directly from within an editor or
      viewer, without having to return to the file list. The delete
      option is available in the topbar context menu, the right
      sidebar action panel or the preview controls bar. Thanks to
      fwinn for proposing this improvement.
    - Croping of Space Images
      Space managers can now select the visible area of a space
      image in a 16:9 aspect ratio. When uploading a space image, a
      crop tool lets you define the exact area shown in the space
      overview and details. Cropping is also completely
      controllable via
      keyboard.
    - Redesigned Account Settings
      Account settings have been redesigned and restructured into
      dedicated pages with a clear left-hand navigation. This makes
      navigating settings simpler and offer a clearer structure and
      better usability.
    - Configurable Logo Link on Login Page
      You can now configure a custom URL for the logo on the login
      page.
      This allows you to redirect users to your organisations
      website, support portal, or any other destination when they
      click the logo.
    - Important Performance Improvement: Reduced CPU Load
      Thanks to this bug report we’ve made several improvements to
      the activitylog service to significantly reduce its impact on
      system performance in 842.

Fri Aug 29 06:16:35 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 3.2.0:
  * Add dark mode and adjust light theme colors
    - This release introduces a new dark mode for improved
      accessibility and user experience in low-light environments.
      Additionally, the light theme color palette has been adjusted
      to align with the generated Material Design color guidelines,
      ensuring visual consistency and design compliance across the
      application.
  * New action "empty trash"
    - A new "Empty Trash" option is now available in the context
      menu of the trash overview. This action allows user to empty
      the trash of a selected space without navigating into it.
      This improvement streamlines the cleanup process for users
      managing multiple spaces.
  * Add fillstate for deleted files in trash overview page
    - The view feature "Show empty trash bins" has been added to
      the trash overview page. This allows users easily filter and
      focus on trash bins that still contain deleted files. This
      enhancement provides a cleaner and more targeted trash
      management experience.

- Update to version 3.1.0:
  * Collabora: New “Export As” and “Save As” Options
    Working in Collabora just got more powerful:
    - Save As You can now save a copy of the current file directly
      from within Collabora.
    - Export As Export your currently edited document into another
      format (e.g. PDF) — no extra tools needed.
    These improvements let you convert and copy documents without
    ever leaving the editor.
  * Simplified "Open" Context Menu for Files
    The file context menu has been redesigned for a cleaner and
    more intuitive experience. A single "Open" entry replaces
    multiple "Open with..." options. This feature is fully
    accessible with keyboards.

    formats:
    - Markup & Web: .html, .css, .scss, .sass, .less

Thu Aug 28 12:51:38 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 3.0.0:
  https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/releases/tag/v3.0.0
  Listing a Space took too long when it included many users.
  To improve performance in this scenario, the drive root
  permissions are no longer expanded automatically (#485).
  This change modifies the API behavior. In accordance with
  Semantic Versioning, we have incremented the major version
  number. No manual migrationsteps are neccesary.
  * Add Profile Photo
    Users can now upload a profile photo to personalize their
    account. The profile image will be displayed in the user
    interface wherever user avatars are shown such as the top bar
    and user lists enhancing recognition and adding a more personal
    touch.
  * Accessibility Improvement: Required Mark for Text Input Fields
    The text input component now includes a proper "required" mark
    for accessibility (a11y). This improves compliance with WCAG
    2.1 and overall form usability.
  * Delete Files Directly from Viewer or Editor
    You can now delete files directly from within an editor or
    viewer, without having to return to the file list. The delete
    option is available in the topbar context menu, the right
    sidebar action panel or the preview controls bar. Thanks to
    fwinn for proposing this improvement.
  * Calendar Integration URL Now Visible in Account Settings
    Users can now easily find their personal CalDAV calendar URL
    directly in the Web UI.
    New "Calendar" panel in the account settings (visible only if
    CalDAV is enabled by the server).
    Includes:
    - CalDAV URL (copyable)
    - Username (copyable)
    - Password info: use an app token for authentication
    This makes it easier to connect your OpenCloud calendar to
    third-party apps like Apple Calendar or Thunderbird.
  * Croping of Space Images
    Space managers can now select the visible area of a space image
    in a 16:9 aspect ratio. When uploading a space image, a crop
    tool lets you define the exact area shown in the space overview
    and details. Cropping is also completely controllable via
    keyboard.
  * Improved Design of the Account Page
    - The Account Page has been redesigned to offer a clearer
      structure and better usability.
