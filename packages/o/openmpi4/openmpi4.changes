    improper handling of partial datatypes that could lead to
    an unexpected application failure.

    the mca_pml_ucx_request_leak_check MCA parameter.
  - Reverted temporary solution that worked around launch issues in
    SLURM v20.11.{0,1,2}. SchedMD encourages users to avoid these

  - Updated PMIx to v3.2.2.
  - Disabled gcc built-in atomics by default on aarch64 platforms.
  - Disabled UCX PML when UCX v1.8.0 is detected. UCX version 1.8.0 has a bug that

    the shared memory transport. UCX versions prior to v1.8.0 are not affected by
    this issue. Thanks to @ksiazekm for reporting the issue.
  - Fixed detection of available UCX transports/devices to better inform PML
    prioritization.
  - Fixed SLURM support to mark ORTE daemons as non-MPI tasks.

    platforms.  Also improved the generated AVX code, and switched to
    using word-based MCA params for the op/avx component (vs. numeric
    big flags).
  - Improved OFI compatibility support and fixed memory leaks in error
    handling paths.
  - Improved HAN collectives with support for Barrier and Scatter. Thanks
    to @EmmanuelBRELLE for these changes and the relevant bug fixes.
  - Fixed MPI debugger support (i.e., the MPIR_Breakpoint() symbol).
    Thanks to @louisespellacy-arm for reporting the issue.
  - Fixed ORTE bug that prevented debuggers from reading MPIR_Proctable.
  - Removed PML uniformity check from the UCX PML to address performance
    regression.

    references about MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.  Thanks to Andreas LÃ¶sel for
    bringing the outdated docs to our attention.
  - Added fence_nb to Flux PMIx support to address segmentation faults.
  - Ensured progress of AIO requests in the POSIX FBTL component to
    prevent exceeding maximum number of pending requests on MacOS.
  - Used OPAL's mutli-thread support in the orted to leverage atomic
    operations for object refcounting.
  - Fixed segv when launching with static TCP ports.
  - Fixed --debug-daemons mpirun CLI option.
  - Fixed bug where mpirun did not honor --host in a managed job
    allocation.
  - Made a managed allocation filter a hostfile/hostlist.
  - Fixed bug to marked a generalized request as pending once initiated.
  - Fixed external PMIx v4.x check.
  - Fixed OSHMEM build with `--enable-mem-debug`.
  - Fixed a performance regression observed with older versions of GCC when
    __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST is used. Thanks to @BiplabRaut for reporting the issue.
  - Fixed buffer allocation bug in the binomial tree scatter algorithm when
    non-contiguous datatypes are used. Thanks to @sadcat11 for reporting the issue.
  - Fixed bugs related to the accumulate and atomics functionality in the
    osc/rdma component.
  - Fixed race condition in MPI group operations observed with
    MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE threading level.

    We intend to enable both by default in Open MPI 5.0.
  * OMPIO is now the default for MPI-IO on all filesystems, including
