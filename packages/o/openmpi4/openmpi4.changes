- Update to version 4.1.0
  * collectives: Add HAN and ADAPT adaptive collectives components.
    Both components are off by default and can be enabled by specifying
    "mpirun --mca coll_adapt_priority 100 --mca coll_han_priority 100 ...".
    We intend to enable both by default in Open MPI 5.0.
  * OMPIO is now the default for MPI-IO on all filesystems, including
    Lustre (prior to this, ROMIO was the default for Lustre).  Many
    thanks to Mark Dixon for identifying MPI I/O issues and providing
    access to Lustre systems for testing.
  * Minor MPI one-sided RDMA performance improvements.
  * Fix hcoll MPI_SCATTERV with MPI_IN_PLACE.
  * Add AVX support for MPI collectives.
  * Updates to mpirun(1) about "slots" and PE=x values.
  * Fix buffer allocation for large environment variables.  Thanks to
    @zrss for reporting the issue.
  * Upgrade the embedded OpenPMIx to v3.2.2.
  * Fix issue with extra-long values in MCA files.  Thanks to GitHub
    user @zrss for bringing the issue to our attention.
  * UCX: Fix zero-sized datatype transfers.
  * Fix --cpu-list for non-uniform modes.
  * Fix issue in PMIx callback caused by missing memory barrier on Arm platforms.
  * OFI MTL: Various bug fixes.
  * Fixed issue where MPI_TYPE_CREATE_RESIZED would create a datatype
    with unexpected extent on oddly-aligned datatypes.
  * collectives: Adjust default tuning thresholds for many collective
    algorithms
  * runtime: fix situation where rank-by argument does not work
  * Portals4: Clean up error handling corner cases
  * runtime: Remove --enable-install-libpmix option, which has not
    worked since it was added
  * UCX: Allow UCX 1.8 to be used with the btl uct
  * UCX: Replace usage of the deprecated NB API of UCX with NBX
  * OMPIO: Add support for the IME file system
  * OFI/libfabric: Added support for multiple NICs
  * OFI/libfabric: Added support for Scalable Endpoints
  * OFI/libfabric: Added btl for one-sided support
  * OFI/libfabric: Multiple small bugfixes
  * libnbc: Adding numerous performance-improving algorithms
- Removed: reproducible.patch - replaced by spec file settings.
