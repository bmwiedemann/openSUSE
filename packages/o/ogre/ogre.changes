-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  1 22:04:44 UTC 2012 - devel.openSUSE.org@gmail.com

- Update to upstream release 1.8.0
    - Terrain changes
       -Terrain vertex data is now compressed by default, reducing the vertex size by 40% on the GPU
       -Terrain data is saved in a compressed format (Deflate) resulting in smaller disk sizes (uncompressed data files are still supported) 
    -DeflateStream added
       -Wraps any other stream to compress / decompress data via the deflate algorithm
       -If given an uncompressed stream to load, automatically falls back on a passthrough read for easy compatibility 
    -Vertex normals can now be animated in morph and pose animation
       -Normals can be included in vertex morph keyframes, and specified as part of reference poses
       -Software, SSE and hardware (shader) pipelines supported
       -Mesh format has been upgraded to support the new data
       -Note: Animated normals are currently not compatible with stencil shadows because of the conflicting vertex structure requirements 
    -Versioned mesh writing
       -MeshSerializer can now write all versions of .mesh back to Ogre 1.0 rather than only being able to write in the latest version format. This should make it easier for tool & exporter developers who can use the latest code but still support users on older versions
       -OgreMeshUpgrader now accepts an optional -V parameter where you can specify the target version to write 
    -New Instancing system
       -Completely new InstanceManager system written from scratch, which is more robust, supports extending it with multiple techniques
       -Interface and behavior very similar to Entity, to mantain consistency and allow easy switch between Entities and Instanced Entities. Instanced Entities can be attached to scene nodes.
       -Implemented ShaderBased technique (up to 80 instances per batch, matrices stored in vertex shader's constant registers)
       -Implemented VTF technique (huge ammount of instances per batch stored in a texture, needs Vertex Texture Fetch)
       -Added "New Instancing" sample to show the capabilities, limits, and features of this new system. 
    -A cache of the binary representation of shaders.
