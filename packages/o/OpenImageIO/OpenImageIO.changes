- update to 2.4.5.0
  * oiiotool: new commands --iccread reads a named file and adds
    its contents as the ICCProfile metadata of the top image,
    --iccwrite saves the ICCProfile metadata of the top file to a
    named file. #3550 TIFF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, and PSD files
    containing ICC profiles now extract and report extra metadata
    related to aspects of those profiles.  #3554
  * Python: support int8[] metadata and retrieving the ICCPorofile
    metadata.  #3556
  * oiiotool: New expression syntax for retrieving metadata
    {TOP[foo]} is similar to the existing {TOP.foo}, if there is no
    foo metadata found, the former evaluates to an empty string,
    whereas the latter is an error.  #3619
  * Strutil: new utf16_to_utf8(const std::u16string&) and
    Strutil::utf8_to_utf16wstring(). #3553
  * ustring: make std::hash work for ustring, add operator< for
    ustringhash, add from_hash() to ustringhash, make ustringhash
    == and != be constexpr for C++17 and beyond. #3577 Custom fmt
    formatter for ustringhash that prints the string rather than
    the hash. #3614
  * Build: the version number is now a CMake cache variable that
    can be overridden (caveat emptor). #3549
  * Build/security: New CMake cache variable FORTIFY_SOURCE, if
    enabled, builds with the specified gcc _FORTIFY_SOURCE option
    defined. This may be desirable for people deploying OIIO in
    security-sensitive environments.  #3575
  * CI: testing now includes using undefined behavior
    sanitizer. #3565
  * Windows: protect against OpenEXR thread deadlock on
    shutdown. #3582
  * Windows: Work around a static destruction order issue. #3591
  * Windows: define NOGDI to keep the inclusion of windows.h from
    adding as many unneeded symbols. #3596
  * MinGW: fix incorrect symbol visibility issue for ImageBuf
    iterators. #3578
  * ARM: improve SIMD operations for ARM NEON. #3599
  * Docs: New RELEASING.md documents our releasing procedures.
    #3564 #3580
  * Docs: Better Windows build instructions in INSTALL.md. #3602
  * Fix missing OIIO::getattribute support for limits:channels and
    limits:imagesize_MB. #3617
  * BMP: fix reading 16bpp images. #3592
  * BMP: protect against corrupt pixel coordinates.
    (TALOS-2022-1630, CVE-2022-38143) #3620
  * DDS: fix alpha/luminance files, better testing. #3581
  * DDS: optimize loading of compressed images, improves 3-5x.
    #3583 #3584
  * DDS: Fix crashes for cubemap files when a cube face was not
    present, and check for invalid bits per pixel.
    (TALOS-2022-1634, CVE-2022-41838) (TALOS-2022-1635,
    CVE-2022-41999) #3625
  * HDR: fix a 8x (!) read performance regression for HDR files
    that was introduced in OIIO in 2.4. #3588 On top of that,
    speed up by another 4x beyond what we ever did before by
    speeding up the RGBE->float conversion.  #3590
  * PNG: fix memory leaks when errors take an early exit.
    #3543 #3544
  * PSD: fix a PSD read error on ARM architecture. #3589
  * PSD: protect against corrupted embedded thumbnails.
    (TALOS-2022-1626, CVE-2022-41794) #3629
  * RAW: additional color metadata is now recognized: pre_mul,
    cam_mul, cam_xyz, rgb_cam. #3561 #3569 #3572
  * RLA: fix potential buffer overrun. (TALOS-2022-1629,
    CVE-2022-36354) #3624
  * Targa: string overflow safety. (TALOS-2022-1628,
    CVE-2022-4198) #3622
  * TIFF/JPEG/PSD: Fix EXIF bugs where corrupted exif blocks could
    overrun memory. (TALOS-2022-1626, CVE-2022-41794)
    (TALOS-2022-1632, CVE-2022-41684) #3627
  * TIFF: guard against corrupt files with buffer overflows.
    (TALOS-2022-1627, CVE-2022-41977) #3628
  * TIFF: guard against buffer overflow for certain CMYK files.
    (TALOS-2022-1633, CVE-2022-41639) (TALOS-2022-1643,

- update to 2.3.15.0:
  * JPEG: Better handling of PixelAspectRatio.
  * OpenEXR: Fix DWAA compression default level.
  * Perf: Huge speed-up of case-insensitive string comparisons
  * New ImageBufAlgo::st_warp() (and oiiotool --st_warp) perform warping of

  * Python: Add ImageSpec and ParamValueList method get_bytes_attribute(),
    which is like get_string_attribute(), but returns the string as a Python
    bytes object. In Python 3, strings are UTF-8, so this can be useful if you
    know that a string attribute might contain non-UTF8 data. #3396

- version update to 2.2.17.0
  Release 2.2.17 (1 Aug 2021) -- compared to 2.2.16
  + Output to DPX files now supports IOProxy. (Input already did.) #3013
  + typedesc.h: TypeDesc can now describe 2D and 3D bounding boxes, as arrays
    of 2 VEC2 aggregates (for 2D) or VEC3 aggregates (for 3D) with "BOX"
    semantic. The shorthand for these are TypeBox2, TypeBox3 (for float),
    and TypeBox2i and TypeBox3i for integer or pixel coordinte
    boxes. #3008
  + Build: Fixes for building against fmt 8.0.0. #3007
  + Build: Finding boost is more flexible when desiring static libraries. #3031
  Release 2.2.16 (1 Jul 2021) -- compared to 2.2.15
  + New UDIM texture name patterns recognized: %(UDIM)d is the Houdini
    convention, and _u##v## is for Animal Logic's internal renderer. #3006
    (2.2.16)
  + When doing color space transforms on images with > 4 channels -- the
    additional channels are now copied unaltered, rather than leaving them
    black. #2987 (2.2.16)
  + FFMpeg: fix some encodings that didn't correctly recognize that they were
    more than 8 bits, or had alpha. #2989 (2.2.16)
    farmhash.h: Clean up all non-namespaced preprocessor symbols that are set
    by this header and may pollute the caller's symbols. #3002 (2.2.16)
  + Fix crashes on M1 (ARM) based Mac. #2990 (2.2.16)
  + Bug fix: avoid divide-by-0 error computing chunk size for invalid image
    sizes. #2983 (2.2.16)
  + make_texture (and maketx and oiiotool -otex) no longer crash if you
    try to make a texture out of a "deep" image; instead it will return an
    error message. #2991 (2.2.16)
  + filesystem.h: Improve exception safety in Filesystem directory iteration.
    #2998 (2.2.16)
  + Build: Improve finding of OpenJPEG. #2979 (2.2.16)
  + Build: Support for building OIIO with gcc 11. #2995 (2.2.16)

    this combination and warn / disable libraw under those conditions. #3003
    (2.2.16)
  + Build: Fix CMake behavior for REQUIRED_DEPS due to a typo. #3011 (2.2.16)
  + Build: Fixes for detecting and using Ptex, among other things got the
    version wrong. #3001 (2.2.16)
  + Testing: If a feature is disabled, skip its tests rather than reporting
    them as broken. #2988 (2.2.16)
  + CI: Test the combination of clang and C++17. #3003 (2.2.16)
  Release 2.2.15 (1 Jun 2021) -- compared to 2.2.14
  + BMP improvements: now support reading rle-compressed BMP files; writing
    single channel grayscale images now save as 8bpp palette images intead of
    24bpp; and reading 8bpp where all palette entries have R==G==B looks like
    a 1-channel grayscale instead of 3-channel RGB. #2976
  + Bug: IBA::render_text did not properly account for alpha of the draw
    color. #2981
  + Bug: Fix runaway parsing time for pathological XMP metadata. #2968
  + Bug: Fixed a crash is ImageCacheFile::read_unmipped when sampling

  + Dev: Add Strutil functions: find, rfind, ifind, irfind. #2960
    non-zero-base channels. (#2962)
  Release 2.2.14 (1 May 2021) -- compared to 2.2.13
  + JPEG: Improve reading of files with mildly corrupted headers. #2927
  + TIFF: Support IOProxy for input. #2921
  + BMP: Improve performance by eliminating wasteful per-scanline allocation
    and needless data copying. #2934
  + Build/CI: Fix all the build_*.bash scripts to not use cmake --config flag,
    which was harmlessly ignored but is flagged as an error for CMake 3.20.
    #2931
  + Build: More fixes related to supporting a wide range of OpenEXR versions,
    and making our exported cmake configs correctly transmit dependencies on
  + OpenEXR include paths. #2935 #2941 #2942 #2947
  + ImageBufAlgo::fillholes_pushpull: added logic to correctly set the spec's
    alpha_channel field when generating sub-images. #2939
  + Python: MakeTxBumpWithSlopes enum value had been inadvertently omitted
    from the Python bindings. #2951

  * Fix build break when using gcc 10 (and some other modern gcc versions)
    but using C++11 compilation mode. #2930
  * CMake: don't use --config inappropriately (CMake 3.20 was broken for
    several of our helper build scripts for building dependencies). #2931
  * Be robust to OpenEXR 2.x installations where IlmBase and OpenEXR had
    separate sets of config files in different subdirectories. #2935

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 21 13:13:56 UTC 2021 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Update to version 2.2.12 (1 Mar 2021)
  + Bug fix: Improve parsing of XMP records in metadata: more
    correct handling
  + of lists/sequences, better inference of types that look like
    int or float
  + (rather than forcing unknown fields into strings), fixed bugs
    in parsing
  + rational values. #2865
  + Bug fix: Fix loading PSB files with cinf tags. #2877
  + Build: Improvements to building or linking static libraries.
    #2854
  + Build: Change default STOP_ON_WARNING to OFF for release
    branches
  + (including this one) so that small change in compiler warnings
    after our
  + release don't break anybody's builds. (Though we still stop on
    warnings
  + for CI builds). #2861
  + Build: More clear warnings about using OpenVDB 8+ when building
    for C++11,
  + because OpenVDB 8 requires C++14 or higher. #2860
  + Build: The pkgconfig OpenImageIO.pc was specifying the include
    path
  + incorrectly. #2869
  + Build: More gracefully handle building against a custom
    Imath/OpenEXR even
  + when another exists in the system area. #2876
  + Build: Minor fixes to build cleanly against the upcoming Imath
    3.0. #2878
  + Dev: hash.h: Make many of the hash functions constexpr. #2843
  + Dev: Better unit tests to verify correctness and stability over
    time of
  + the hash functions. #2853
  + Dev: unordered_map_concurrent.h: New methods find_or_insert,
    nobin_mask().
  + #2867
  + CI: Speed up CI builds by not building OpenEXR example
    programes. #2857
  + CI: Speed up CI by using GitHub 'cache' actions + ccache. #2859
  + CI: Separate stages (setup, deps, build, test) into separate
    GHA "steps"
  + for better logging and understanding of the timing and
    performance. #2862
  + CI: Now actively testing libheif in Linux CI. #2866
  + CI: Remove the last vestiges of Travis-CI, which we no longer
    use. #2871
  + CI: For failed tests, add CMake cache and log part of the saved
    artifacts.
  + PSA: Avoid libheif 1.10 on Mac, it is broken. Libheif 1.11 is
    fine.

- Update to version 2.2.11 (1 Feb 2021)
  + Enabled AVIF decoding of heic files (requires libheif >= 1.7
    and for it
  + to have been built with an AV1 encoder/decoder). #2811 #2812
    #2814 #2818
  + oiiotool --help now prints the OCIO version (where it prints
    the config
  + file and known color space). #2849
  + Bug fix: ImageBufAlgo::ociolook() and ociofiletransform()
    internally
  + reversed the order of their inverse and unpremult arguments,
    making it
  + hard to select the inverse transformation. #2844
  + Fix memory leak during decoding of some invalid Exif blocks.
    #2824
  + Build: Fixed warnings when building against python 2.x. #2815
  + Build: No longer directly link against python libraries when
    unnecessary.
  + #2807
  + Build: Better finding of OpenJpeg 2.4. #2829
  + Build: On Windows, fix some linkage problems by changing the
    pybind11
  + bindings to make a CMake "shared" library rather than "module".
    Sounds
  + wrong, but seems to work. We will reverse if this causes
    problems. #2830
  + Build: On Mac, libheif 1.10 is very broken. Don't use that
    version. #2847
  + Build: Fix build break against changes coming in future
    libtiff, where it
  + is changing from some libtiff-defined integer types to the
    equivalent
  + stdint.h types. #2848
  + Build: Some final touches to prepare for release of OpenColor
    2.0. #2849
  + Build: Fixes to support the libraw 202101 snapshot (their in-
    progress
  + 0.21.0). #2850
  + CI: Got Windows CI fully working, bit by bit. #2796 #2805 #2821
    #2826
  + #2834 #2835 #2836 #2840
  + Dev: Some internal rearrangement of span.h and string_view.h
    (that should
  + not break source or ABI compatibility). std::size() and
    std::ssize()
  + should work with OIIO::span and OIIO::string_view now. #2827
  + Dev: ustring internals now have a way to ask for the list of
    ustrings
  + whose hashses collided. #2786
  + Dev: New Filesystem::generic_filepath() returnss a filepath in
    generic
  + format (not OS specific). #2819
  + Dev: ArgParse::abort() lets the response to a command line
    argument signal
  + that no further arguments should be parsed. #2820
  + Dev: In oiioversion.h, added macros OIIO_VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL
    and
  + OIIO_VERSION_LESS. #2831
  + Dev: In platform.h, added macro OIIO_INLINE_CONSTEXPR, which is
    equivalent
  + to inline constexpr for C++17, but just constexpr for C++ <=
    14. #2832

- Update to version 2.2.10.1 (7 Jan 2021)
  + Fix build break against OpenColorIO v2.0 RC1. #2817

- Update to version 2.2.10 (1 Jan 2021)
  + GIF: support for UTF-8 filenames on Windows. #2777
  + OpenEXR: Fix rare crash during multithreaded output. #2781
  + OpenEXR: Fix potential crash parsing OpenEXR header that
    contains Rational
  + attributes with certain values. #2791
  + Improved error reporting for IOFile failures to open the file.
    #2780
  + Build: Fix webp compile break on 32 bit systems. #2783
  + Build/Windows: Fix symbol definition conflict with pyconfig.h.
    #2800
  + CI: Test the latest fmt, PugiXML, and pybind11 releases. #2778
  + Docs: Add explanation of oiiotool -otex modifiers that were
    missing from
  + the docs. #2790 Fix some duplicated text. #2785

- Add more optional dependencies: 
  + ffmpeg
  + Ptex
  + libheif (conditionally on TW)
- Fix filename
- Exclude more failing tests: unit_simd and heif
- Adjust %doc inclusions

Fri Apr 13 07:42:24 UTC 2018 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to release 1.8.10 and
  rebase oiio-add-libdl-for-plugin.patch.
- Upstream changes since 1.8.6 :
  *oiiotool frame sequence wildcard improvements: fix handling of
   negative frame numbers and ranges, also the `--frames` command
   line option is not enough to trigger a loop over those frame
   numbers, even if no other arguments appear to have wildcard
   structure. #1894
  *TIFF bug fix: read_tile() and read_tiles() input of
   un-premultiplied tiles botched the "shape" of the tile data
   array. #1907
  *fmath.h avx-512 improvements. #1893
  *testsuite is not Python 2/3 agnostic.
  *Properly find newer openjpeg 2.3. #1871
  *Bug fix in IBA::copy where uninitialized dst image botched its
   ROI. #1876
  *RAW: Important bug fix when dealing with rotated (and vertical)
   images, which were not being re-oriented properly and could get
   strangely scrambled. #1854
  *OpenEXR: gracefully detect and reject files with subsampled
   channels, which is a rarely-to-never-used OpenEXR feature that
   we don't support properly. #1849
  *Field3d: Prevent crashes when open fails. #1848
  *RAW: Add "raw:HighlightMode" configuration hint to control
   libraw's handling of highlight mode processing. #1851
  *simd.h: Minor fixes especially for avx512. #1846
  *iv: Drop GLEW and obsolete GL stuff from iv in favor of
   QOpenGLFunctions, and fix broken pixelview text rendering. #1834
  *Add explicit DL library dependency to libOpenImageIO.so itself
   instead of only to the binaries and test utilities. #1860
  *Build fixes for Hurd OS. #1850
  *All string->numeric parsing and numeric->string formatting is
   now locale-independent and uses '.' as decimal marker. #1796
  *oiiotool outputs are now written to temporary files, then
   atomically moved to the specified filename at the end. This
   makes it safe for oiiotool to "overwrite" a file
   (i.e. `oiiotool in.tif ... -o out.tif`) without problematic
   situations where the file is truncated or overwritten before the
   reading is complete. #1797
  *Python bindings for ImageBuf.get_pixels and set_pixels fixed
   some bugs when passed an ROI without a channel range specified.
   #1802
  *More robust parsing of XMP metadata for unknown metadata names.
   #1816
  *strutil.h now includes a to_string<> utility template. #1814

Tue Dec  5 13:45:38 UTC 2017 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Drop bundled fonts, recommend google-droid-fonts instead
- Add oiio-add-libdl-for-plugin.patch
- Update to release 1.8.6, upstream changes since 1.8.5 -
  for more details see included CHANGES.md:
  * oiiotool: Improved logic for propagating the pixel data format
    through multiple operations, especially for files with multiple
    subimages. #1769
  * ImageCache/TextureSystem: improved stats on how long we wait for
    ImageInput mutexes. #1779
  * Build: Fix build bug where if the makefile wrapper got CODECOV=0,
    it would force a "Debug" build (required for code coverage tests)
    even though code coverage is instructed to be off. (It would be
    fine if you didn't specify CODECOV at all.) #1792
  * Build: minor fixes for Windows build. #1793, #1794
  * Developers: The ParamValue class has added get_int_indexed() and
    get_float_indexed() methods. #1773
  * Developers: array_view added begin(), end(), cbegin(), cend()
    methods, and new constructors from pointer pairs and from std::array.
  * Developers: Fixed build break in simd.h when AVX512VL is enabled. #1781
  * Developers: fmath.h now defined OIIO_FMATH_H so other files can
    easily detect if it has been included.
  * Build: Fix broken build when Freetype was not found or disabled. #1800
  * Python: fixed missing exposure of RATIONAL enum value. #1799
- Update to release 1.8.5 (beta), upstream changes since 1.7.x:
  * New oiiotool features:
    --info:format=xml, --info:verbose=1, --colormap, -i:type=..., -i:ch=a,...,
    --echo STRING, --eraseattrib, --text takes new optional modifiers, --deepholdout
  * New ImageBufAlgo functionality:
    + color_map() applies a color map based on the input values; #1552 (1.8.1)
    + Added implementation of ImageBufAlgo::to_IplImage(). #1461 (1.7.9/1.8.1)
    + render_text() has added parameters controlling text alignment and drop
      shadows. #1646 (1.8.3)
    + deep_holdout() culls all samples that are farther away than the opaque
      depth of a second holdout image. #1691 (1.8.4)
  * DICOM file format support (currently read-only). DICOM is the standard
    for medical imaging data. Will only build if dependency "dcmtk" is
    found at build time. #1534 (1.8.1)
  * Experimental: The TextureSystem API has been extended to support batches
    of texture lookups in a SIMD fashion. At present, only the new API was
    added, a full implementation is in progress and may not be forthcoming
    or reliable until 1.9. Even the API is experimental, and may change for
    future releases. #1733 (1.8.5)
  * Public API changes in TypeDesc; ImageSpec; ColorConig::createLookTransform()
    and createDisplayTransform(); ImageBuf::read(); new OIIO::getattribute()
    queries; ImageBufAlgo::render_text(); DeepData; ImageBufAlgo::colorconvert(),
    ociolook(), and ociodisplay(); ParamValueList::get_float
  * Fixes, minor enhancements, and performance improvements in:
    + oiiotool
    + ImageBufAlgo; ImageBuf; TextureSystem / ImageCache / maketx
    + BMP; FFMpeg/movies; GIF; IFF; JPEG; OpenEXR; PNG; PSD; RAW; RLA; TIFF; webp; Nuke
    + Fixed several (so far unnoticed) buffer overruns and memory leaks. #1591 (1.8.2)
  * Build/test system improvements

  * Fix a subtle static initialization order problem. #1757
  * Build: Improved finding LibRaw. #1749
- Update to release 1.7.16, upstream changes since 1.7.15:
  * OpenEXR: fix problem with 2-channel images putting the channels
    in the wrong order. #1717
  * TIFF: images with fewer than 4 channels, but one of those
    channels was alpha, were not correctly marking their
    spec.alpha_channel. #1718
  * Several minor updates to simd.h backported from mater.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 11 09:02:39 UTC 2017 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to release 1.7.15 sync with blender.
- Upstream changes:
    *Add "raw:user_sat" configuration attribute to the reader. #1666
  *Better exception safety for `Filesystem::searchpath_find()`.
   #1680
  *Improved I/O of color separation images, particularly those
   with custom InkSet attributes. #1658
  *Fix rare case TextureSystem crash. #1685
  *oiiotool expression substitution now recognizes FRAME_NUMBER and
   FRAME_NUMBER_PAD. #1648
  *oiiotool -resize and -resample now have more intuitive behavior
   for images where the display and pixel data windows are not the
   same, especially if the data window had a nonzero origin (such
   as with crop or overscan). #1667
  *oiiotool --resample and ImageBufAlgo::resample() have been
   extended to work for "deep" images. #1668
  *ImageCache::get_image_info() will now return a proper error
   (and not hit an assertion) if asked for information about a
   subimage or MIP level that does not exist in the file. #1672
  *ImageBuf copy constructor from another ImageBuf was previously
   broken for IB's that wrap application buffers. #1665
  *TextureSystem::get_texels fixes crashing behavior. #1669
  *Fixes to OSX rpath behavior of linked binaries. #1671
  *OpenEXR file input: fixed problem with sorting order of spectral
   alpha channels (RA, GA, BA, or AR, AG, AB). #1674
  *ImageBufAlgo::deep_merge() (and oiiotool --deepmerge) now will
   give a useful error message if you try to merge two deep images
   that do not have the same number of channels. #1675
  *ImageCache/TextureSystem statistics no longer list as "BROKEN"
   files which were invalidated, or files that were initialized
   with an ImageCacheFile but never opened. #1655

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr  2 08:21:20 UTC 2017 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to release 1.7.13
- Fix gcc7 build with the following build flags:
   -Wno-error=maybe-uninitialized -Wno-error=noexcept-type
   -Wno-error=format-truncation= and -Wno-error=aligned-new=
-  Rebased oiio_gcc6_missleading_indentation.patch
- Upstream changes since 1.7.11:
 * TIFF, JPEG, others: Improved reading Exif meatdata from XMP
  blocks, now it does a better job of discerning the proper data
  types. #1627
 * RAW: The default value for missing "raw:use_camera_matrix" has
  been changed to 1 (not 0) to better match default behavior of
  libraw/dcraw. #1629
 * RAW: Add support for selecting new demosaicing algorithms:
  "DMT" (mode 11) and "AAHD" (mode 12). Renamed the "Modified AHD"
  to "AHD-Mod" to simplify and match libraw terminology. Made
  matching of demosaicing algorithms case-insensitive. #1629
 * RAW: Support "ACES" color space for direct conversion while
  reading RAW images (supported in libraw 0.18 or newer). #1626
 * oiiotool: Improved error reporting of file open errors when
  -iconfig is used. #1626
 * oiiotool `--echo STRING` prints the string to the console. This
  can contain expressions! So you can do something like oiiotool
  file.exr -echo "Size is {TOP.width}x{TOP.height}" #1633
 * JPEG: Be more reslient to malformed Exif data blocks with bogus
  offsets. #1585, #1639
 * TIFF output omitted setting the "Make" and "Model" metadata tags.
  #1642
 * webp: Several new sanity checks prevent the webp reader from
  spending too much I/O time and memory reading bogus files
  (malformed, corrupted, or not a webp after all). #1640
 * PSD: Support has been added for "cmyk", "multichannel", and
  "grayscale" color modes. And support was fixed for rgb and
  grayscale 32 bit per sample bit depth. #1641
 * BMP: add support for version 5 headers. #1616
 * TIFF: Fix typo that prevented correct reading of some Exif
  fields. #1625
 * ImageBuf: Fix broken threads(n) method, which didn't correctly
  pass the right number of threads along. #1622.
 * Fix build warnings about undefined OIIO_MSVS_AT_LEAST_2013 symbol.

Thu Jan 14 13:28:59 UTC 2016 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to release 1.7.0dev
- Explicitly enabled build with openssl because the build fails on
  i586 due to internally defined types.
- Upstream changes:
  Major new features and improvements:

   Public API changes:
 * DeepData internals and API overhaul: struct internals hidden, now you
   must use the API; DeepData declaration is now in deepdata.h, not in
   imageio.h; DD methods now allow insertion and erasure of individual
   samples. #1289 (1.7.0)
 * imageio.h: Removed items deprecated since 1.4: a version of
   convert_types() that took alpha and z channel indices
   (but never used them). #1291
 * fmath.h: Removed safe_sqrtf, safe_acosf, fast_expf, which have been
   deprecated since 1.5. (1.7.0) #1291
 * Removed ImageBufAlgo::flipflop(), which was deprecated since 1.5 and
   is now called rotate180. #1291 (1.7.0)
 * Several varieties of ImageCache and TextureSystem getattribute methods
   were noticed to not be properly declared 'const'. This was fixed.
   #1300 (1.7.0/1.6.9)

   Fixes, minor enhancements, and performance improvements:
   * oiiotool:
    * oiiotool --subimage now takes as an argument either the subimage
      numeric index, or a subimage name. #1287 (1.7.0)
    * oiiotool's image cache was smaller than intended because of typo.
      (1.7.0/1.6.9)
  * ImageBufAlgo:
    * The varieties of add(), sub(), mul(), and div() that take an
      image operand and a per-channel constant operand have all been
      modified to work properly for "deep" images. #1297 (1.7.0)
  * maketx:
    * maketx -u now remakes the file if command line arguments or OIIO
      version changes, even if the files' dates appear to match.
      #1281 (1.7.0)
  * TIFF:
    * When outputting a TIFF file, a special attribute "tiff:half", if
      set to nonzero, will enable writing of 16-bit float pixel data
      (obviously, only if the spec.format is HALF). #1283 (1.7.0)
    * TIFF input: erase redundant IPTC:Caption and IPTC:OriginatingProgram
      if they are identical to existing ImageDescription and Software
      metadata, respectively. (1.7.0/1.6.9)
  * Video formats:
    * The ffmpeg-based reader had a variety of fixes. #1288 (1.7.0)

  Build/test system improvements:
 * Fix build break against Boost 1.60. #1299,#1300 (1.7.0/1.6.9/1.5.23)
 * filesystem_test now much more comprehensively tests the contents of
   Filesystem. #1302 (1.7.0)
 * fmath_test adds benchmarks for various data conversions. #1305 (1.7.0)

  Developer goodies / internals:
 * parallel_image has been improved in several ways: can choose split
   direction; raised minimum chunk size to prevent thread fan-out for
   images too small to benefit; uses the calling thread as part of the
   pool. #1303 (1.7.0)
 * timer.h: DoNotOptimize() and clobber() help to disable certain
   optimizations that would interfere with micro-benchmarks. #1305 (1.7.0)
 * simd.h improvements: select(); round(); float4::store(half*),
   int4::store(unsigned short*), int4::store(unsigned char*). #1305 (1.7.0)
 * fmath.h: convert_types has new special cases that vastly speed up
   float <-> uint16, uint8, and half buffer conversions. #1305 (1.7.0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 11 13:21:08 UTC 2016 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Update to release 1.6.9
- Upstream changes:
  Release 1.6.9 (released 5 Jan 2016 -- compared to 1.6.8)
  * Several varieties of ImageCache and TextureSystem getattribute
    methods were noticed to not be properly declared 'const'.
    This was fixed. #1300 (1.6.9)
  * Fix build break against Boost 1.60. #1299,#1300 (1.6.9/1.5.23)
  * The Python bindings for ImageCache was overhauled after several
    of the methods were found to be horribly broken. #1300 (1.6.9)
  * oiiotool --subimage now allows a subimage name as argument, as
    well as the numeric index. #1271,#1287 (1.6.9)
  * TIFF input: erase redundant IPTC:Caption and IPTC:OriginatingProgram
    if they are identical to existing ImageDescription and Software
    metadata, respectively. (1.6.9)
  * Fix oiiotool image cache smaller than intended because of typo.
- See /usr/share/doc/packages/OpenImageIO/Changes for changes since
  1.5.20

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 19 06:05:23 UTC 2015 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Recommented Field3D build requirement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 14 09:21:22 UTC 2015 - hpj@urpla.net

- download, verify and recompress _service added
- Release 1.5.20
  * Nuke plugin: don't crash with NULL Knob* in TxReaderFormat::setMipLabels.
    #1212
  * Fix build warnings for new Apple tools release that upgrades the standard
    clang release. #1218
  * Make TIFF reader robust to strange TIFF files that have unexpected MIP
    level-to-MIP level changes in planarconfig, photometric, palette,
    extrasamples, etc. We previously assumed these things would never vary
    between MIP levels of the same file, and Murphy called our bluff. #1220,1221

- Release 1.5.19
  * Fix compile warnings on some platforms/compilers.
  * Fix build break with certain new versions of libraw. #1204
  * Internals: Timer and ScopedTimer have changed slightly. This isn't used
    in any public OIIO APIs, but may affect 3rd party programs that like
    to use OIIO's timer.h for convenience. #1201
  * Internals: dassert.h has added OIIO_STATIC_ASSERT macros for static
    assertion. Doesn't affect existing OIIO apps since they are new
    additions, but feel free to use them! #1202

- Release 1.5.18
  * PSD input improvements: better error handling for files lacking "global
    layer mask info" or "additional layer info"; additional PSD signatures
    for global additional layer info; better error handling when dealing
    with an empty layer mask. #1147
  * TIFF output: recognize special "tiff:write_exif" metadata, which when
    present and set to 0, will skip writing the Exif directory into the TIFF
    file. This can be helpful when you expect the resulting TIFF file to be
    read with very old versions of libtiff. #1185
  * Top-level Makefile option USE_OPENCV=0 to turn off even searching for
    OpenCV components. #1194

- Release 1.5.17
  * Fix support for older ffmpeg version on Ubuntu 14.04. #1168
  * Fix bug in fft -- was not always zeroing out the imaginary channel. #1171
  * Build-time fixes for Nocona CPUs that have SSE3 without SSSE3. #1175
  * ustring fixes for new gcc (5.1+) and new std::string ABI. #1176
  * Fixes for unit test timer_test for new OSX versions with timer
    coalescing. #1181
  * Fix bugs with rangecompress and rangeexpand when using luma. #1180
  * Fixes for clean build when using clang 3.6. #1182

- Release 1.5.16
  * PNG writes now honor PixelAspectRatio attribute. #1142
  * Build fixes for Visual Studio 2010 #1140
  * PSD & JPEG plugins fixes for Win32 compilation.
  * Also search for OIIO plugins in [DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH. #1153
  * Give Strutil::parse_string an option to not strip surrounding quotes.
  * Fix Nuke plugin build files to not do anything if USE_NUKE=0  #1156
  * New ImageInput query: "procedural" -- returns 1 if the ImageInput may
    not correspond to an actual file. #1154
  * TypeDesc has a new constructor and fromstring of a string_view, in
    addition to the old versions that took char*. #1159
  * Eliminate spurious ImageCache invalidation just because the shared
    cache is requested again. #1157
  * Fixed trilinear MIPmap texture lookups that gave invalid alpha fill. #1163
  * Filesystem: sequence matching should clear results arrays upon start.

- Release 1.5.15
  * Bug fix with IBA::channels() with deep data with UINT channels.
  * Fix TypeDesc compatibility with OSL.
  * Misc WIN32 / VS2010 fixes.
  * Fix incorrect logic in convert_image with certain channel types and
    strides. #1144

- Release 1.5.14
  * fmath: save_fast_pow improves the precision of its results for
    special cases of pow(x,1) and pow(x,2). #1094 (1.5.13)
  * Fix warnings when compiling with C++11. (1.5.13)
  * Dont link Python framework on OSX. #1099 (1.5.13)
  * Improve IBA::compare() (and therefore oiiotool -diff and idiff) when
    the images being compared have NaN or Inf values. #1109 (1.5.13)
  * TextureSystem bug fix that occasionally resulted in NaN in the alpha
    channel result when looking up from 3-channel images. #1108 (1.5.13)
  * Added TypeDesc::TypeHalf(). #1113 (1.5.13)
  * Fix IBA::channels() bugs when dealing with "deep" images. #1113 (1.5.13)
  * Python ImageSpec.set_channel_formats() now works when the channel
    type lists are either TypeDesc, in addition to the existing support
    for BASETYPE. #1113 (1.5.13)
  * Added Python bindings for DeepData and deep reads (ImageInput) and
    writes (ImageOutput). #1113 (1.5.13)
  * Fix bugs in reading deep OpenEXR images with mixed channel types.
    #1113 (1.5.13)
  * Fix bug in IBA::convolve() for the case when the kernel image passed
    is not a float image. #1116 (1.5.13)

- Release 1.5.13
  * oiiotool: Bug fix for frame sequences -- could crash in Windows. #1060
  * New ImageOutput::supports() tags: supports("alpha") should be true for
    image formats that support an alpha channel, supports("nchannels") should
    be true for output formats that support an arbitrary number of output
    channels. #1058
  * oiiotool: Gracefully handle requests to save an image with more channels
    than the output file format can handle. Instead of being a fatal error,
    now it's just a warning, and extra channels are dropped. It tries to
    to find R, G, B, and A channels, saving them. If those names are
    not found, it just saves the first 3 (or 4) channels. #1058
  * Improved handling of "PixelAspectRatio" for JPEG, TIFF, and OpenEXR.
    #1042 #1066
  * oiiotool: Improve error messages when files can't be read. It is now
    easier to to distinguish files that don't exist from those that
    are an unknown format from those that are corrupted or have read
    errors. #1065
  * maketx now writes to a temporary file, then moving it to the final
    requested output filename only when the write completed without error.
    This prevents situations where maketx crashes or is killed and leaves
    behind a file that looks correct but is actually corrupted or
    truncated. #1072
  * Python: added previously-M.I.A. ImageSpec.erase_attribute(). #1063

Sun Oct 27 18:00:27 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.2.2:
  * New features:
    + New oiiotool --siappend : append subimages of top two images on stack.
    + Utilities: added Strutil::contains() and icontains().
  * Fixes:
    + Fixes in handling XMP & IPTC metadata.
    + oiiotool --origin and --fullpixels did not correctly propagate their
      changes to the output images.
    + oiiotool --colorconvert (and the underlying ImageBufAlgo::colorconvert)
      could crash if given a color conversion recognized as a no-op.
    + DPX output could crash when writing crop images.
    + DPX input was not recognizing the proper image offset or originalsize.
    + oiiotool --fit wasn't padding correctly or modifying offsets properly.
  * Build fixes:
    + Fix compiler error on MIPS platform.
    + Add FIELD3D_HOME description to 'make help'
    + Always use the HDF5 release libraries (for Field3D), not the debug ones.
  From version 1.2.1:
  * oiiotool: Fix memory leak when processing frame range.
  * Docs improvement: full documentation of ImageBufAlgo.
  * oiiotool --help now returns a success error code, not a failure.
  * oiiotool: fix incorrect help message about --ociolook.
  * oiiotool: Fix typo in "oiio:Colorspace" attribute name that interfered
    with correct color space conversion in --colorconvert.
  * Many fixes for compiler warnings on various platforms: fmath_test.cpp,
    field3dinput.cpp, sysutil.cpp, argparse.cpp, oiiotool.cpp.
  * Fixes problems on little-endian architecture with texture3d.cpp.
  * Fix compilation problems on architectures with gcc, but no 'pause'
    instruction.
  * Fix build search path for correctly finding libopenjpeg 1.5.
  * Work around bug in older MSVC versions wherein Filesystem::open needed
    to explicitly seek to the beginning of a file.
  * Build fixes for FreeBSD.
  * Fix testsuite/oiiotool on Windows -- windows shell doesn't expand
    wildcards.
- Removed oiio-typedef.patch (fixed upstream).
- Rebased oiio-ppc.patch and oiio-arm.patch to apply cleanly.
- Added an upstream patch (hdf5_libs.patch) to fix linking with HDF5 libs.

Sun Jun  9 13:44:29 UTC 2013 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.1.11:
  * IFF input: bug in endian swap of 16 bit IFF files.
  * oiiotool: fix a minor bug where tiled files were output inappropriately.
    (Had been patched in master some time ago.)
  * fmath.h additions: safe_inversesqrt, safe_log, safe_log2, safe_log10,
    safe_logb.  These are versions that clamp their inputs so that they
    can't throw exceptions or return Inf or NaN.
  * Fix to not incorrectly print ImageCache stats for certain broken files.
  From version 1.1.10:
  * IBA::fillholes() and oiiotool --fillholes can smoothly fill in alpha
    holes with nearby colors. Great for extrapolating the empty areas of
    texture atlas images so that filtered texture lookups pull in a plausible
    color at part edges.
  * IBA::clamp and oiiotool --clamp clamp pixel values to a scalar or
    per-channel min and/or max, or clamp alpha to [0,1].
  * IBA::rangecompress()/rangeexpand(), and oiiotool --rangecompress /
    --rangeexpand compress the excess >1 values of HDR images to a log
    scale (leaving the <= 1 part linear), and re-expand to the usual
    linear scale.  This is very helpful to reduce ringing artifacts that
    can happen when an HDR image is resized with a good filter with negative
    lobes (such as lanczos3), by doing a range compression, then the resize,
    then range expansion. It's not mathematically correct and loses energy,
    but it often makes a much more pleasing result.
  * maketx --hicomp does highlight compression -- automatically doing a
    range compress before each high-quality resize step, and then a
    range expansion and clamp-to-zero (squash negative pixels) after
    each resize.
  * DPX - when writing DPX files, properly set the pixel aspect ratio.
  From version 1.1.9:
  * IBA::resize and oiiotool --resize/--fit: Bug fixes to resize filter
    size selection fix artifacts wherein extreme zooms could end up with
    black stripes in places where the filters fell entirely between samples.
  * oiiotool --fit: fix subtle bugs with aspect ratio preservation for
    images with differing data and display windows; and allow "filter=..."
    to override the default filter used for fit.
  * Resize improvement: fix potential artifacts at the image edges resulting
    from odd clamping behavior.
  * Even more frame range wildcard flexibility with oiiotool --frames and
    --framepadding options.
  * oiiotool --resize and --fit (and the underlying IBA::resize()) have been
    sped up significantly and are now also multithreaded.
  From version 1.1.8:
  * oiiotool --chappend (and ImageBufAlgo::channel_append() underneath) allow
    you to take two files and concatenate their color channels.
  * oiiotool --chnames allows you to rename some or all of a file's color
    channels.
  * oiiotool can loop over entire frame ranges by specifying wildcard
    filenames such as "foo.#.tif" or "bar.1-10#.exr".
  * Cmake: OVERRIDE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX allows the shared library suffix
    to be overridden (e.g., if you need to force .so names on OSX rather
    than the usual default of .dylib).
  From version 1.1.7:
  * Back out dangerous change to thread.h that was in 1.1.6, which could
    cause performance problems.
  * Compile fix for WIN32 in strutil.cpp
  * Compile fix for Windows XP - add implementation of InterlockedExchangeAdd64
- Added txt2man as build requirement.
