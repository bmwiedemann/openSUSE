  New Features:
  * Graphical LED view allows you to see the current settings and
    select multiple LEDs to apply colors quickly.
  * Device detection happens in the background and a progress bar
    shows detection progress, allows you to cancel detection.
  * Keyboard and mouse LED names have been standardized, allowing
    better integration with Aurora (use dev branch).
  * New I2C tool for reading multi-byte SMBus registers (as ASRock
    uses).
  Device Controller Changes:
  * New controller for Corsair Hydro Series coolers (only Pro
    variants H100i Pro and H115i Pro for now).
  * New controller for Tecknet M008 Mouse.
  * New controller for HyperX Pulsefire Surge Mouse.

  * More MSI GPUs added
  * RGB Fusion 2 USB detection fixed
  * Keymaps added to many keyboard controllers
  Known Issues:
  * RGB Fusion 2 SMBus controller may incorrectly be detected when
    an MSI GPU is present (due to address 0x68).
  * Redragon M711 wave effect doesn't work.
  * Corsair mice do not have specific LED labels.
  * Some Razer keyboards are missing key maps.
  * Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro takes 2 "Set All Device" clicks to
    properly set.
  * Asus Addressable number of channels may be incorrect.

- Update to version 0.3
  * GUI now includes an SDK client. This allows one UI to
    control multiple PCs as long as they are running the SDK
    server.
  * Default SDK server port changed to 6742 (this is "ORGB" on a
    phone keypad)
  * CLI now includes --server and --client options for starting
    an SDK server or client
  * OpenRGB will now automatically attempt to connect to a local
    server. If it exists, the hardware detection will be
    skipped. This allows use in a client/daemon model.
  * Many new drivers and driver improvements. See the supported
    devices list on the wiki.
  * MSI Mystic Light controller has been disabled. It was
    causing bricked RGB on certain boards.
