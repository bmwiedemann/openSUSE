  OpenRazer-win32 in the settings. This allows use of the new Razer
  controller with better device support. Due to plugin versioning change,
  you may have to delete your old plugins manually before OpenRGB will
  install new ones. To do this, go to the Settings tab, under General
  Settings click Open Settings Folder. Close OpenRGB, then delete the
  plugins folder in this directory. Reopen OpenRGB and you can install
  new plugins from the settings tab.
