- Update to version 0.6
  New Features:
  * Plugin architecture - OpenRGB plugins add functionality to
    the user interface.
    + Plugins include effects engine, E1.31 receiver, visual map
      editor, and more.
  * Additional user interface configurable options
    + Exit to tray
    + Save window geometry
    + Display index number labels in LED view
  * Log manager
    + Logs are stored in configuration directory under logs
      folder
  * Update detector list in configuration file before detection,
    to avoid crashes
  * SDK server provides capability to list and load profiles
    (protocol version updated to 2)
  * Reworked Linux build system to test on multiple Debian-based
    distros
  Device Controller Changes:
  * MSI Mystic Light re-enabled after deep dive investigation
    into RGB controller bricking issue
    + Only motherboards that have been tested are enabled
    + We can help you unbrick if your board was bricked with a
      previous version, join our Discord for help
  * PCI ID filtering added to ASUS GPU controller
  * Additional GPUs added to MSI GPU controller
  * Additional GPUs added to Gigabyte GPU controller
  * EVGA GPU v2 controller updated to support all modes
  * HyperX Pulsefire FPS Pro controller added
  * Yeelight controller added (see configuration in wiki)
  * Additional serial protocols for Arduino-controlled ARGB
    + TPM2
    + Adalight

  * E.31 improvements
    + Maximum channels per universe (fixes WLED compatibility)
  * Corsair K55 support added
  * Corsair K57 controller added (wired mode only)
  * Corsair Vengeance Pro DRAM direct mode
  * Standalone Razer controller, does not depend on OpenRazer
    + A bunch of new Razer devices supported, including Razer
      Chroma ARGB controller
  * DAS Keyboard 4Q controller added
  * NZXT Hue 2 Underglow device added
  * Thermaltake Riing Quad controller added
  * ASUS ROG Strix Flare controller added
  * Lian Li Uni Hub controller added
  * Creative Sound BlasterX G6 controller added
  * Consolidated Logitech mouse controllers to reduce duplicate
    code
  * Added Direct mode to Logitech consolidated Logitech mouse
    code
  * Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum controller added
  * QMK OpenRGB controller added (requires configuration entry)
  * Logitech wireless mouse support improved
  Known Issues:
  * G502 Hero and G502 PS mice crash on startup. The issue has
    been fixed in the pipeline builds.
  * Plugin architecture does not have a versioning system. If
    OpenRGB crashes on open, try deleting/updating all plugins.
  * Some ASUS GPUs that worked in 0.5 no longer work in 0.6.
    + Please open an issue on GitLab or join our Discord to get
      its PCI ID added. We need the following information:
      x Card marketing name and model number (Link to ASUS
        website preferred)
      x PCIe ID (Vendor, Product, Subvendor, Subproduct)
      x Detector I2C address (you can get this using a
        previous version of OpenRGB, version 0.5 recommended)
  * Redragon M711 wave effect doesn't work
  * Some Corsair mice do not have specific LED labels
  * Some Razer keyboards are missing key maps
  * Asus Addressable number of channels may be incorrect
  Notes:
  * Due to changes in device names, existing profiles you have
    saved from previous versions may not work and will need to
    be recreated. Same goes for saved addressable controller
    sizes.
  * If upgrading from a previous release, it is recommended to
    disable OpenRazer or OpenRazer-win32 in the settings. This
    allows use of the new Razer controller with better device
    support.
