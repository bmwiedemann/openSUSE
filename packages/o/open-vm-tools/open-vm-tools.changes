Wed Dec 28 08:18:43 UTC 2022 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@suse.com>

- Migration of PAM settings to /usr/lib/pam.d.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 14 21:24:00 UTC 2022 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Don't list libgrpc++, libgrpc, and libprotobuf in the containerinfo Requires
  section.  The dependencies will be added automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 13 19:54:02 UTC 2022 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Don't use new LDFLAGS, -labsl_synchronization -lgpr, when building for SLE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 12 19:01:53 UTC 2022 - Caleb Crane <caleb.crane@suse.com>

- Add containerInfo plugin (jsc-PED-1344)
  - Add dependencies on grpc, protobuf, and containerd for container
    introspection

- Added patches (jsc-PED-1344)
  + detect-suse-location.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  8 20:24:29 UTC 2022 - Caleb Crane <caleb.crane@suse.com>

- Add _service to handle open-vm-tools sources
- Update to 12.1.5 (build 20735119) (boo#1205962)
  - A number of Coverity reported issues have been addressed.

  - The deployPkg plugin may prematurely reboot the guest VM before cloud-init 
    has completed user data setup. If both the Perl based Linux customization 
    script and cloud-init run when the guest VM boots, the deployPkg plugin 
    may reboot the guest before cloud-init has finished. The deployPkg 
    plugin has been updated to wait for a running cloud-init process to 
    finish before the guest VM reboot is initiated. This issue is fixed in 
    this release.

  - A SIGSEGV may be encountered when a non-quiesing snapshot times out. 
    This issue is fixed in this release.

  - Unwanted vmtoolsd service error message if not on a VMware hypervisor.
    When open-vm-tools comes preinstalled in a base Linux release, the vmtoolsd
    services are started automatically at system start and desktop login. 
    If running on physical hardware or in a non-VMware hypervisor, the services
    will emit an error message to the Systemd's logging service before stopping.
    This issue is fixed in this release.

Mon Oct  4 22:19:03 UTC 2021 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 11.3.5 (build 18557794) (boo#1190987)
  + New/Updated features:
    - Added a configurable logging capability to the network script.
      The network script has been updated to:
        use vmware-toolbox-cmd to query any network logging configuration from
        the tools.conf file.  Use vmtoolsd --cmd "log ..." to log a message to
        the vmx logfile when the logging handler is configured to "vmx" or when
        the logfile is full or is not writeable.
    - The hgfsmounter (mount.vmhgfs) command has been removed from
      open-vm-tools.
      The hgfsmounter (mount.vmhgfs) command is no longer used in
      Linux open-vm-tools. It has been replaced by hgfs-fuse. Therefore,
      removing all references to the hgfsmounter in Linux builds.
  + Resolved issues:
    - Customization: Retry the Linux reboot if telinit is a soft link to
      systemctl.
    - Open-vm-tools commands would hang if configured with "--enable-valgrind".
  + Spec file updates for:
    - rpmlint errors
    - arg_xmlsec1 --enable-xmlsec1 for better xmlsec1/libxml2 handling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 24 14:15:09 UTC 2021 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 11.3.0 (build 18090558) (boo#1187567)
  + Resolved issues:
    - The following github issues and pull requests have been resolved:
      446, 481, 500, and 509
    - The following Pull requests have been resolved: 474 and 505
    - A number of issues detected by Coverity, internally or by third parties,
      have been addressed.
    - A command line tool, vmwgfxctrl, has been added to open-vm-tools for
      Linux that can be used to control various aspects of the vmwgfx Linux
      kernel module.  Currently it can both display and set the current
      topology of the vmwgfx kernel driver. It is useful when trying to
      configure custom resolutions on recent Linux distributions, including
      multi-monitor setups.
    - A command line tool, vmware-alias-import, has been added to
      open-vm-tools that can be used to import vgauth config data and apply
      it to the running vgauth service.
    - Enhancements to support or utilize various vSphere features.
- Fixed bug (bsc#1185175) In vmtoolsd.service move deprecated path
  "/var/run" to "/run" for it's PIDfile.

        https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/blob/stable-11.2.5/open-vm-tools/ChangeLog

- Update pam-vmtoolsd.patch: With the pam_securetty.so entry fixed, only need
  the modified Makefile.am portion of the patch which copies the suse file to
  the /etc/pam.d/vmtoolsd file rather than the default generic file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  2 14:34:21 UTC 2020 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Enable build on aarch64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 19:31:01 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Add explicit pkgconfig(gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0) BuildRequires: used
  to be pulled in (as part of gdk-pixbuf) by GTK3 in the past. But
  as configure explicitly looks for it, it is our own duty to
  ensure its presence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 20:37:22 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 11.2.0 (build 16938113) (boo#1177987)
  + Fixed memory leak occurs in disk device mapping information for IDE,
    SATA or SAS (LSI Logic SAS) disks configured in the guest.
  + The following issues and pull requests reported on
    https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools have been addressed:

    11.2.0 release is available at:
      https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/blob/stable-11.2.0/open-vm-tools/ChangeLog

- Update pam-vmtoolsd.patch (boo#1177987): removed the pam_securetty.so line
  from the new suse file.  Modified the Makefile.am to copy the suse file to
  the /etc/pam.d/vmtoolsd file rather than the default generic file.

- jsc#ECO-2164 for update 11.1.0 (build 16036546) (boo#1171764)
- Fixed bug (bsc#1172693) by removing the 'pam_securetty.so' line from
  pam-vmtoolsd.patch as instructed by vmware (boo#1171003).  
  This should fix both (boo#1171003) and (bsc#1172693).  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 20:56:17 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- VMware has now asked that in updating to 11.1.0 (build 16036546) (boo#1171764)
  to hold off on producing the open-vm-tools-sdmp service discovery plugin
  (boo#1171765) for all SUSE versions due to the plugin's dependency on
  netstat.  Once they have removed the netstat dependency we will need to go
  through the ECO process to get the plugin added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 20:35:31 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- While updating to 11.1.0 (build 16036546) (boo#1171764) hold off on
  producing the open-vm-tools-sdmp (boo#1171765 Service Discover plugin)
  until it has gone through the ECO process.  Once approved, will resubmit
  to include the plugin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 15 22:53:34 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 11.1.0 (build 16036546) (boo#1171764, boo#1171765)
  + open-vm-tools 11.1.0 includes a new 'Service Discovery' plugin, which
    connects with the vRealize Operations Manager product.  For more
    information and details on configuring this plugin, refer to Configuring
    Service Discovery.
  + In this release, a new tools.conf switch is added to enable and disable
    the guest customization in the guest virtual machine. By default, the
    guest customization is enabled. For more details, refer KB 78903.
- Spec file changes to remove the is_opensuse macros where possible.
- Remoed the mv vm-support line from the spec file.  vm-support is now
  automatically placed in the /usr/bin directory.
- Added version number to Requires: libxmlsec1-openssl1 to help with vgauth
  version checking.
- Added patches
  + pam-vmtoolsd.patch (boo#1171003)
- Drop unnecessary patch:
  - app_info_plugin.patch
  - diskinfo-debug-logging-1162435.patch
  - gcc9-static-inline.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 17:10:27 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Simplified the conditional around systemd_ordering to just use
  suse_version >= 1500.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  6 22:46:16 UTC 2020 - Kirk Allan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 11.0.5 (build 15389592) (boo#1165955)
  + DNS server is reported incorrectly as '127.0.0.53' when using
    systemd-resolved. DNS server is reported incorrectly in GuestInfo as
    '127.0.0.53' , when the OS uses systemd-resolved. This issue is fixed
    in this release.
- Conditionalized the use of systemd_ordering.  Use systemd_ordering
  for factory, openSUSE >= 15, and SLE >= 15.  Use systemd_requires
  for older openSUSE and SLE releases.
- Conditionalize out the use of %license COPYING for SLE 12 SP2 and older.
- Added patches
  + gcc10-warning.patch (boo#1160408)
  + diskinfo-debug-logging-1162435.patch (boo#1162435 and bsc#1162119)
    - Changed g_warning to g_debug
  + app_info_plugin.patch (boo#1165955)
- Drop unnecessary patch:
  - fix-leaks-Aliases-MappedAliases.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 24 14:55:18 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- BuildRequire pkgconfig(udev) instead of udev: allow OBS to
  shortcut through the -mini flavor.
- Use systemd_ordering in place of systemd_requires: systemd is
  never strictly required to run open-vm-tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 11 11:47:05 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  7 20:16:47 UTC 2019 - kallan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update vmtoolsd.service tools to run after the network service is
  ready. (bsc#1133623)

- Link VGAuthService to libxmlsec1 rather than libxml-security-c in
  SLES 12 SP3. (bsc#1122435)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 29 14:33:57 UTC 2019 - kallan <kallan@suse.com>

- Update to 10.3.10 (build 12406962) (boo#1130898)
  + Resolved - In certain cases, quiesced snapshots on Linux guests do not
    include backup manifests.
- Drop unnecessary patch:
  - include_log_h_for_g_info.patch
  - no_manifest_on_aborted_snapshot.patch
  - send_vmbackup_event_generic_manifest.patch
  - vmtoolsd_bailout_on_rpc_errors.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 13 19:50:35 UTC 2019 - kallan <kallan@suse.com>

- Link VGAuthService to libxmlsec1 rather than libxml-security-c for
  SLES 15 and SLES 15 SP1. It requires libxmlsec1 to be available in the
  base.  VGAuthService is already being linked with libxmlsec1 for
  SLES 12 SP4.  (bsc#1122435)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 26 09:26:00 UTC 2019 - Martin Liška <mliska@suse.cz>

- Add gcc9-warnings.patch (bsc#1126102).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb  8 15:30:25 UTC 2019 - kallan@suse.com

- Link VGAuthService to libxmlsec1 rather than libxml-security-c in SLE
  products where available. (bsc#1122435)

- Add patches to correct and/or improve handling of certain quiesced snapshot
  failures (bsc#1124397).
  + no_manifest_on_aborted_snapshot.patch
    Don't send a backup manifest when aborting a Linux quiesced snapshot.
  + vmtoolsd_bailout_on_rpc_errors.patch
    Bail out vmtoolsd early when there are RPC errors.
  + send_vmbackup_event_generic_manifest.patch
    Always send VMBACKUP_EVENT_GENERIC_MANIFEST during quiesced snapshots.
  + include_log_h_for_g_info.patch
    Include vmware/tools/log.h to define g_info.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 29 21:43:09 UTC 2019 - kallan@suse.com

- Update vmtoolsd.service to support cloud-init customization by default  
  by adding "DefaultDependencies=no" and "Before=cloud-init-local.service"
  to the [Unit] section of vmtoolsd.service (bsc#1121964) .
- Copyright year updated in spec file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  9 15:40:16 UTC 2018 - kallan@suse.com

- Update to 10.3.5 (build 10430147) (boo#1115118)
  + While running a quiesced snapshot of a Linux guest on the vSphere hosts
    earlier than version 6.7, open-vm-tools logs warning messages.
  + CreateTemporaryFileInGuest/CreateTemporaryDirectoryInGuest returns a file
    path that does not exist.
  + Excessive spikes of the Memory/Workload percentage metric, in a vRealize
    Operations cluster.
  + open-vm-tools Service running as vmusr crashes on Linux systems which are
    not running on the VMware platform.
- Drop unnecessary patch:
  - false-negative-cloud-init.patch
  - handle-linux-kernel-stat-overflow.patch
  - optional-override-os-name.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 12 20:43:54 UTC 2018 - kallan@suse.com

- Added Handle Linux kernel /proc FS uint32 type stat overflow when calculating
  (bsc#1110793).
  + handle-linux-kernel-stat-overflow.patch
    On both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, tools always parses Linux kernel /proc
    FS stats as uint64 values.  For rate stats, current - previous can handle
    uint64 type stat overflow, but not uint32 type.
- Added patch for Optional override for short and long OS names sent from Tools
  (bsc#1047469).
  + optional-override-os-name.patch
    Added support for customers to override the returned long and short OS
    names through the tools config file. If the setting is present, then names
    gathered by hostinfo will be ignored. The user is responsible for setting
    the appropriate names.
- Added patch for Workaround for false negative result when detecting
  cloud-init existance (bsc#1111619)
  + false-negative-cloud-init.patch
    "cloud-init -v" cmd is used to detect if cloud-init is properly configured
    and it works on most linux distros. However in some linux distro like
    Amazon Linux 2, "cloud-init -v" will print result to stderr instead of
    stdout and it makes "forkExecAndWaitCommand" give false negative result.
    1. added a new bool switch in  "ForkExecAndWaitCommand" to choose
      if we should ignore the stderr output when the return code is 0
    2. removed unnecessary reference for "ForkExecAndWaitCommand" in
      linuxDeploymentUtilities.c
    3. trivial change for some formatting

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 15 18:07:49 UTC 2018 - kallan@suse.com

- After updating the project to include openSUSE_Leap_15.0 and SLE_15, the
  builds for these two projects fail because of unresolved dependencies.
  Some Factory configuration settings were being used for them.  Need to adjust
  the spec file to not use Factory configuration settings for
  openSUSE_Leap_15.0 and SLE_15.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 10 16:23:27 UTC 2018 - kallan@suse.com

-  Remove vgauthd.service from the %pre and %post section in the spec file.
   This allows vmtoolsd.service to enable vgauthd if needed which creates
   the vmtoolsd.service.requires/vgauthd.service symlink. (bsc#1103868)

- Add Requires: libxmlsec1-openssl1 to the spec file.  This is needed when
  using xmlsec1 rather than xml-ssecurity-c.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  6 19:52:34 UTC 2018 - kallan@suse.com

- Update to 10.3.0 (build 8931395)
  + Starting with 10.3.0, open-vm-tools builds with xmlsec1 by default (instead
    of building with xml-security). To revert to the old behavior and build
    with xml-security, use the option '--enable-xmlsecurity' for the
    ./configure command.
  + Add BuildRequires:  libxml2-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  3 18:26:54 UTC 2013 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 9.2.0:
  + Fixes for HGFS driver to compile on newer kernels (3.6).
  + vmsync driver is disabled on kernels 3.0+ as vmbackup plugin
    uses FIFREEZE/FITHAW standard ioctls.
  + Fixes for Copy/Paste (and C&P is temporarily disabled on
    Solaris due to C++ library issues).
- Rebase open-vm-tools-kernel-3.6.patch: mostly fixed upstream.
- No longer build vmblock.ko: it's been obsoleted in favor of
  vmblock-fuse.
- Change vmtoolsd to use vmware-vmblock-fuse instead of vmblock.ko,
  using the new mount point /var/run/vmblock-fuse.
- Add fuse Requires, as we now use vmblock-fuse.
* Fixes bnc#803157.

Sat Aug  4 10:45:41 UTC 2012 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- autostart-wrapper: unset SESSION_MANAGER. This helps newer
  gnome-session versions to not try to track this task. Due to the
  double fork() it gets it wrong and delays logout (waiting for a
  timeout to terminate this user task) (bgo#681904).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    make it to syslog during normal operation.
  + The GUI version of the toolbox was removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 27 08:58:46 UTC 2011 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  + HGFS mounter and vmusr's suid wrapper were changed to avoid
    issues with symlink attacks. A new mount utility for vmblock on
    Solaris and FreeBSD was added.
  + The VMCI driver was thoroughly reworked so that it can serve as
    both the host and guest VMCI driver. This is mostly targeted at
    supporting nested VMs.

  + vmxnet3.tar.bz2
  + vmemctl.tar.bz2
- Fix some lint warnings: obsolete only <, not <=, Add PreReq:
  permissions to the -gui package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Linux Kernel, for bnc#605085.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 22 11:25:39 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Re-introduce vmxnet3 on openSUSE <= 11.2. Up to then we have
  kernel 2.26.31, which does not bring the vmxnet3 driver yet.
  The driver itself is the last one shipped with open-vm-tools,
  version 2009.12.16.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 21 10:36:21 CEST 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Send SIGUSR1 to vmware-user process when the services are being

  + New functionality in the Unity support code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 23 09:27:23 UTC 2010 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Disabled vmxnet3 building. this only did not give an error anyhow
  as there was a typo, thus having the module already disabled for
  quite some time.
- bnc#590329: Re-add lost 50-vmnics.conf file.

    support compilation of some code on ARM.
  + some fixes in configure.ac to try to correctly support newer
    distros.
  + vsock/vmci improvements.
  + bug fixes in the vmxnet / vmxnet3 drivers, and FreeBSD's
    vmblock driver.
  + vmxnet3 for Linux is now upstream (as of Linux 2.6.32), and
    will be removed from later releases of open-vm-tools.
  + pvscsi will be available upstream starting with Linux 2.6.33
    and at that time will be removed from open-vm-tools.
- Disable building of vmxnet3 if kernel is 2.6.32 or newer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 23 22:04:39 CET 2009 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to 2009.11.17

- Update to 2009.09.18
  + Mostly bug fixes and minor enhancements.
  + The pvscsi code was re-factored in preparation for upstreaming.
    The driver has been sent to the LKML for inclusion in the main
    Linux tree and might be removed from open-vm-tools once it's
    accepted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 10 18:37:21 CEST 2009 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to 2009.08.24
  + Remove support for Linux kernels < 2.6.9.
  + The vsock now implements a new notification protocol that has
    better performance than the previous.
  + New infrastructure for sending more network config-related
    information about the virtual machine to the host.
  + Other bug fixes and minor improvements to the code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  8 13:31:49 CEST 2009 - dominique-obs@leuenberger.net

- move libguestlib.so to the devel pakage, which we have since
  version 2009.07.22 and remove the rpmlint check for it.
- Remove the autoreconf call. We do not patch any Makefiles anymore.
- Require libvmtools0 from the -devel package.
- Drop the rpmlintrc file. Permissions are correctyl set, devel
  package split out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  6 16:43:54 CEST 2009 - meissner@suse.de

- Adjust specfile permission handling to match SUSE standard, snippet
  moved to permissions package. bnc#474285

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 11:35:10 CEST 2009 - dominique-obs@leuenberger.net

- Update to 2009.07.22
  * Better support for dkms by means of a script to help create a
    dkms tree.
  * "make install" now also installs header files for public
    libraries, plus a few fixes to incorrect install behavior.
  * Lots of improvements to the new DnD code.
  * This will be the last release with support for Linux
    kernels < 2.6.9.
- fix compatibiliy update script to redirect stderr to /dev/null
  (in case the script is not found, do not scare the user)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 21 12:19:11 CEST 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- added || : to modprobe -r and umount calls in vmtoolsd [bnc#523342]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 19 08:55:36 CEST 2009 - dominique-obs@leuenberger.net

- Updated to 2009.06.18
  * Mostly a bug fix release.
  * vmhgfs now is able to use vsock as a transport (although
    backend support for HGFS over vsock is not yet released in
    VMware products).
- Removed patch open-vm-tools-wiperPosix.patch. An alternative
  solution was integrated upstream 
- Dropped patch open-vm-tools-rpath.patch: merged upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 23 09:38:07 CEST 2009 - dominique-obs@leuenberger.net

- Updated to 2009.05.22
  * Mostly a cleanup and bug fix release.
  * Fix a build issue where a symlink attack could cause the 
    open-vm-tools build to overwrite data (by placing a symlink in
    /tmp).
  * Second (and last?) batch of changes to clean up duplicate files
    in the source tree, including Solaris and FreeBSD kernel
     modules andother module-specific shared files.
  * Plugins now are properly built using plugins_LTLIBRARIES so 
    that "-rpath" doesn't need to be used (this would cause an
    RPATH entry to be added to the final binary, which some tools
    didn't like).
  * open-vm-tools now properly detects PAM and enables PAM support
    in the code. 
- Removed -rpath.patch. Variation of it integrated upstream
- Added patch to consume (-wiperPosix.patch) the result of fgets
- BuildRequires pam-devel
- The pam miss-naming on x86_64 has been fixed upstream
- Add a new -rpath patch. Not everything is solved upstream.
- Delete arch dependent files from /usr/share (not yet needed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 25 23:24:33 CEST 2009 - dominique.leuenberger@tmf-group.com

- Upgrade to snapshot 2009.04.23
  * Implemented copy & paste support for RTF data and file contents.
  * guestd has been removed from open-vm-tools; vmtoolsd is now the only
    option for the main tools service.
  * Added vmblock and vmmemctl modules for Solaris (under the CDDL).
  * vmware-user can now work with both vmblock-fuse and vmblock.
  * Linux HGFS now has a stream-based (TCP, vsock) transport, still under
    development.
  * First batch of changes to cleanup duplicated files in the source tree.
    Most duplicated files in the Linux kernel modules have been cleaned up. 
- Extensive rewrite of the spec file: 
  * make use of the now upstream provided make install
  * configure --no-root-privileges, to not install mount.vmhgfs as suid
- Add patch open-vm-tools-2009.04.23-rpath.diff: removes the rpath logic
  which was introduced for the vmusr and vmsvc plugins. libtools is broken
  in this respect. (patch submitted upstream for review)
- Extend preun section with  service rename (vmware-guest -> vmtoolsd)
  (patch provided by prusnak)
- forcibly activate vmtoolsd service also on update.
- fix up the KMP rename: for this to work we need to provide / obsolete
  vmware-kmp and vmware-kmp-<kernelflavor>; otherwise, zypper starts pulling
  in other kernels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 21 00:03:12 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- rename vmware-KMP to vmware-guest-KMP for easier identification 
  of the use and to avoid confusion (users installing the KMP on the
  vmware hosts) (bnc#481137)
- create subpackage libvmtools0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 19 13:02:15 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Upgrade to snapshot 2009.03.18
  * Mostly a bug fix release.
  * The new DnD V3 protocol is now available in open-vm-tools.
  * vmtoolsd is now preferred instead of vmware-guestd
    - vmware-guestd will most probably be completely removed in the next release.
    -> vmtoolsd is not yet standard enabled in openSUSE packages.
- Obsolete merged patches vmxnet and vmxnet3.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 21:38:17 CET 2009 - mmarek@suse.cz

- renamed modprobe config to /etc/modprobe.d/50-vmnics.conf
  (required by new module-init-tools).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 19 09:40:12 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Upgrade to snapshot 2009.02.18
  * open-vm-tools now depend on glib 2.6.0 as a minimum requirement.
  * Added vmxnet module for Solaris, and reworked the HGFS module so it
    works without help from vmware-guestd.
  * Added implementation of new DnD protocol, which adds a dependency on
    a C++ compiler and the gtkmm library to vmware-user.
  * The code from the "core services" has been added to open-vm-tools,
    including a few tests. vmtoolsd + plugins are now capable of replacing
    vmware-guestd (vmware-user still needs to have some features ported
    over), but this code is still not to be considered as stable as the
    legacy services, so vmware-guestd is still included.
  * A few fixes for compatibility with non-GNU toolchains, newer Linux
    kernels and old gcc compilers.
- Added patch open-vm-tools-2009.02.18-vmxnet.patch
  Allows to compile kernelmodule vmxnet with kernels 2.6.29
  And open-vm-tools02009.02.18-vmxnet3.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 16 14:26:13 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Remove noDisplay=true from vmware-user.desktop, as KDE4
  does not autostart the app in this case. Fixes BNC #475627

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 12 10:46:15 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Added vmware-user-autostart-wrapper to solve bnc #474076
  Using simple autostart technique, it can happen that the device
  at /proc/fs/vmblock/dev is not ready when vmware-user is started
  the autostart-wrapper takes this into account and tries for 
  several times.
- Fix RPMLint warning with regarding wrong encoding of README file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 11 20:45:00 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Revert suid install of vmware-user-suid-wrapper, as rpmlint does
  not like it
  Instead we package /etc/permissions.d/open-vm-tools which sets
  the permission usig SuSEconfig.permissions
- Adjust the vmware-user.desktop file to actually launch
  vmware-user-suid-wrapper. Access to the vmblock requires su right.
  the suid-wrapper get's the file handle, drops the suid rights
  and launches vmware-user (with user privileges)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 10 11:07:27 CET 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- install vmware-user-suid-wrapper with suid bit

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 22 09:05:00 CET 2009 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Update to version 2009.01.21
    * First open source release of the HGFS module for Solaris,
      under the CDDL. Other modules are expected to be added in
      the upcoming releases.
    * Added an implementation of vmblock on top of FUSE;
      vmware-user still  doesn't use this module even if it is
      available, though.
    * Linux modules now add the "supported" tag used by Novell in
      their SLES 10 SP2 release when loading modules.
    * Fix compilation of modules in newer Linux kernels which
      don't include $(LINUXINCLUDE) in the compiler flags anymore.
- Added Requires: kernel-%1 to preamble, as rpmlint said it would
  be policy to require kenrel-$favour from the kmp
- marked config files in /etc as %config (rpmlint)

Thu Dec 25 16:37:00 CEST 2008 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Update to version 2008.12.23
  * Lots of makefile cleanup with the switch to using libtool archives.
  * Automatically disable Unity if multimon support is disabled.
  * Actually build the pvscsi modules.
  * First bits of the "Core Service" project are starting to show up; the
    base "vmtools" library was added to the package. It currently is mostly
    a collection of the existing libraries already shipped with open-vm-tools,
    plus some extra functionality build on top of glib. Currently no other
    code in open-vm-tools uses it, so it's optional.
  * The HGFS driver was fixed for the Linux 2.6.28 kernel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 19 19:04:00 CEST 2008 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Updated to version 2008.11.19
  * The pvscsi Linux kernel module has been added (for kernels >= 2.6.8).
    It provides access to VMware's new paravirtualized SCSI device.
  * The HGFS driver and user-level code has seen a lot of refactoring to
    enable more consistent name escaping. The FreeBSD driver now supports
    symlinks.
  * The Linux module makefiles now support exporting symbol version files,
    allowing modules with dependencies (such as vsock, which depends on vmci)
    to correctly build and load on Linux >= 2.6.26 with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.
  * Rudimentary support for dkms.
  * Assortment of bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 15 20:41:00 CEST 2008 - dominique@leuenberger.net

- Updated to version 2008.10.10
  * The vmxnet3 Linux kernel module has been added. This module provides
    better network performance for the guest. The corresponding virtual
    hardware is available beginning with Workstation 6.5, though
    performance benefits are unlikely to be realized until a later VMware
    product release. The module should work for all kernels beginning with
    2.6.
  * The open-vm-tools no longer depend on libproc-dev. Several people
    reported this issue (Sourceforge bug 1960947).
  * Added a command line argument to skip privileged operations during
    make install (--without-root-privileges).
  * Guestd now supports backwards time synchronization, though the
    corresponding hypervisor-side changes are not yet part of any shipping
    VMware products.
  * Assortment of bug fixes.

Fri Aug 12 16:17:07 CEST 2008 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 2008.08.08
  * Unity for X11 guests has been added. Unity is implemented within
    vmware-user and requires no additional setup beyond setting up the
    vmware-user application itself. Unity should work with Fusion 1.x
    releases as well as with the upcoming Workstation 6.5 release. Our
    in-house testing was with Linux guests, and they should mostly work.
    There is very little standing in the way of FreeBSD/Solaris support,
    though we've never built or tested Unity for those platforms.
  * The VMCI Linux kernel module has been added. This module provides
    high-speed datagram and socket interfaces for guest<->guest and
    host<->guest communication. It should work for all kernels beginning
    with 2.4, and for VMware products beginning with Workstation 6.5.
  * The VMCI sockets Linux kernel module has been added. It provides
    both datagram and stream socket interfaces to userlevel for use with
    VMCI. As with VMCI, it should work for kernels 2.4 or later, and for
    VMware products beginning with Workstation 6.5.
  * The command-line Toolbox has been added. This application provides
    the same functionality as the GTK Toolbox, but with a scriptable
    command-line interface. It also has some statistic retrieval commands
    that aren't found in the GTK Toolbox.
  * Fixed compilation of vmsync and vmmemctl Linux kernel modules on
    2.6.26. Thanks to Pavol Rusnak for the report (Sourceforge bug 2032683).
  * Fixed an issue with guestd's nicInfo updating mechanism. Thanks to
    Jason Lunz for the patch (not tracked on Sourceforge).
  * Fixed handling of $(DESTDIR) in automake. Thanks to Mike Auty for
    the patch (Sourceforge bug 2018802).
  * Fixed build of vmware-user using gtk 1.2. Thanks to Stephen Duncan
    for the report (Sourceforge bug 2014338).
  * Fixed compilation of lib/guestApp when using --without-x. Thanks to
    Martin Preishuber for the report (Sourceforge bug 2013568).
  * As usual, other bug fixes.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 21 17:02:15 CEST 2008 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 2008.07.01:
  * fixed a backwards time synchronization issue
  * fixed an issue where open-vm-tools configured via --without-x didn't

    --with-linuxdir to the ./configure script
  * other bug fixes.
