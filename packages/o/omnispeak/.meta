  <title>An reimplementation of &quot;Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy!&quot;</title>
  <description>Omnispeak is an open-source reimplementation of Commander Keen
episodes 4, 5, and 6. It aims to be a pixel-perfect, bug-for-bug
clone of the original games, and is compatible with savegames
from the DOS version.

Omnispeak also includes several new features, including:
 * Improved graphics scaling and compatibility support.
 * Dramatically improved joystick/gamepad support.
 * QuickLoad and QuickSave support (F5 and F9 by default)
 * Support for real AdLib / OPL2 compatible sound cards
 * Support for the OPL2LPT

NOTE:
To play the Commander Keen games with omnispeak you need the
original game files!

Run
 * omnispeak-keen4
 * omnispeak-keen5
 * omnispeak-keen6
from the folder where the original game files are located.
