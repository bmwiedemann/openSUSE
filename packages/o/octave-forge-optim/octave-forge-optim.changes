- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * Build fixes for Octave 5.1 and some bug fixes.
  * With Octave from version 5.1 on, a parallel cluster established
    with package `parallel' can be used for computation of gradients
    with option `parallel_net'.
  * Compatibility frontend `fmincon' has been added.
  * `lsqnonlin' and `lsqcurvefit' now accept a problem structure as
    single argument for compatibility.
  * LinearRegression:
    - Corrected errors in computing variances of data and
      parameters.
    - Erroneous documentation of the 2nd output (`e_var',
      variances of data) has been fixed.
    - The 5th output (previously `y_var'), which was erroneously
      documented as the variances of dependent variables, has been
      replaced by `fit_var', the variances of computed function
      values.
  * Removed deprecated function `samin'. The functionality is
    available with the `samin' backend of function `nonlin_min'.
- Drop add_missing_iostream_include.patch: fixed in upstream
  sources.

  Add add_missing_iostream_include.patch
- Corrected Url: tag

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  * Added dependency on statistics package.
  * Some bug fixes and build fixes for Octave 4.4.
  * Unit test for nlinfit is now reproducible.
  * Added unit tests in nonlin_residmin and nonlin_curvefit.
  * Default algorithm of `nonlin_min' is now more robust.
  * Standalone function `samin' is deprecated. The functionality
    has been moved into a `samin' backend of function
    `nonlin_min'.
- Drop optim-gcc-warnings.patch: incorporated upstream.

- Update to version 1.5.2
  * Builds with Octave 4.2.
  * Links to core Octave documentation work now in html version of
    package documentation.
  * Fixed treatment of one-parameter-functions in `jacobs'.
  * The sign of `lambda' returned for equality constraints by
    `quadprog' has been changed for compatibility with Matlab.
  * Deprecated `nmsmax' -- the same code is in `fminsearch' in core
    Octave, with a slightly different interface.
  * Fixed bug which could break building oct-files.
- Fix GCC warnings
  * optim-gcc-warnings.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 10 16:00:01 UTC 2016 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.0
  * Compatible with Octaves new exception-based error
    handling.
  * New compatibility wrapper functions 'lsqnonlin' and 'lsqcurvefit',
    calling the more general functions 'nonlin_residmin' and
    'nonlin_curvefit' iternally.
  * New compatibility wrapper function 'nlinfit', calling
    'nonlin_curvefit' and 'curvefit_stat' internally. New functions
    'statset' and 'statget' for compatibility in handling options of
    'nlinfit'.
  * New common frontend option 'TypicalX'. Additional common frontend
    options 'FinDiffRelStep' and 'FinDiffType', to match usual option
    names. 'diffp' and 'diff_onesided' are still available and can now
    also be specified as scalars.
  * nonlin_residmin and nonlin_curvefit return determined Lagrange
    multipliers of any constaints
  * New interface function 'quadprog', similar to Octaves 'qp'.
  * New function 'lsqlin'.
  * Removed deprecated functions 'minimize', 'd2_min', and
    'fmin'. Removed obsolete documentation 'optim-mini-howto-2'.
- Drop obsolete:
  * optim-gcc-errors.patch
  * optim-no-doc-rebuild.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 13 17:46:57 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.1
  * Made compatible with Octave 4.0.
  * Fixed bug #43699.

- Split from octave-forge package, version 1.4.0
- Fix no-return-in-nonvoid-function
  * optim-gcc-errors.patch
- Disable documentation rebuild
