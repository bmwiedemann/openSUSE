  <description>Generation of accessor and iteration functions for ocaml variant types.

ppx_variants_conv is a ppx rewriter that can be used to define first
class values representing variant constructors, and additional
routines to fold, iterate and map over all constructors of a variant
type.

It provides corresponding functionality for variant types as
ppx_fields_conv provides for record types.
