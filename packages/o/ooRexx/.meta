  <description>Open Object Rexx is an object-oriented scripting language. The language is designed for both beginners and experienced Rexx programmers. It is easy to learn and use, and provides an excellent vehicle to enter the
world of object-oriented programming without much effort.

It extends the procedural way of Rexx programming with object-oriented features that allow you to gradually change your programming style as you learn more about objects.
