    <version>3.1.1</version>
    <time>1688563901</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 3.1.1:
  * Adding back in &quot;layers&quot;, &quot;markers&quot; to webview changes - since we accidentally filtered them out.
  * Allow &quot;duration&quot; to be sent to the webview, to allow auto-increase project duration / auto resize the timeline
  * Protect setWindowTitle from being called by a different thread (preview_thread - if sample_rate is updated). Protect preview_thread::update() method from triggering with 'sample_rate' update.
  * Protecting timeline webview from unrelated changes - which can sometimes happen prior to the webview being fully loaded (causing a freeze on launch of OpenShot)
  * On launch of OpenShot, convert float sample_rate into Integer (if needed), and update settings::sample_rate if needed. This causes our audio device to freeze
  * Bumping version to 3.1.1, min libopenshot dependency to 0.3.2
  * Updating donors and supporters
  * Updating translations for 3.1.1 release
  * Protect from generating a waveform for a NULL clip (we should skip clips that we can't find or query). Reported in Sentry: OPENSHOT-1WJ5
  * Show friendly error to user when Export dialog fails to parse project JSON data: Reported in Sentry: OPENSHOT-6X
  * Refactor some logic in Parent / Child property context menus - to be simpler, and more efficient. This solves a bug on Windows also, where file paths were not matching correctly.
  * Adding debug logs to property widget context menus
  * Removing items from &quot;Parent&quot; and &quot;Child Clip ID&quot; and &quot;Parent Effect&quot; context menus in the Property dialog - for example, clips with no effects, or clips with no tracking data, etc... Also, making things more consistent with parent folders in context menus (None, Clips, Tracked Objects)
  * Fix object detector and tracker effects when using context menus, color pickers, and other property dialog editors - to correctly update the JSON without destroying certain data or &quot;objects&quot;
  * Allow clearing the &quot;Parent&quot; and &quot;Child Clip ID&quot; properties of a clip / effect, and allow setting of the initial value to work correctly.
  * Extending objects protections to color_update and remove_keyframe methods - to ignore when an object_id is not found, or a clip has no 'objects' dict
  * Updating timeline `changed` callback to always reset the current value of ENABLE_PLAYBACK_CACHING. For example, sometimes we have already disabled this setting before changing the timeline data - and we would like it to stay disabled until further notice. This method was accidentally re-enabling the caching when we were not expecting it to.
  * Protecting property widget exception when a label returns an invalid data tuple for the current selected property label: Sentry reported this error: OPENSHOT-43. This also fixes a regression related to updating ObjectDetector and Tracker objects.
  * Protecting property widget exception when a label returns an invalid data tuple for the current selected property label: Setnry reported this error: OPENSHOT-43.
  * Protecting timeline args from non-Integer values. Detected on Sentry: OPENSHOT-245G
  * Fix for editing a title and trying to update a thumbnail on the timeline - was missing a required arg
  * Removing freeze from github actions - too difficult to maintain compatibility with all the different builders
  * Fixing issue where we still had many duplicate profile descriptions causing issues. Adding `- width x height | DAR` suffix for only the duplicate ones.
  * Removing old ubuntu 18.04 github builder, adding 22.04
  * Ignore profile folders on Export dialog init - removes warning log about &quot;failed to process&quot; profile folder
  * Adding Profile search button to Preferences for easier filtering and searching for a default profile
  * Updating duplicate profile names to use unique name (with DAR appended onto the end)</comment>
