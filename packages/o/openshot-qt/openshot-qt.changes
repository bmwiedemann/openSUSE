Fri Aug 27 09:03:55 UTC 2021 - ecsos@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.6.0:
  * Adding check for empty $REQUEST_UUID on Mac builds
  * Removing unneeded digest (i think), to prevent an Angular error when we have subsequent applyJsonDiff calls very close together (i.e. slice a clip)
  * Fix a regression from https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt/pull/4230, which broke multi-select drag and drop for clips and transitions.
  * Fixing spelling error and changing Blender log to warning instead of error, since this is a perfectly valid outcome (with the wrong version of blender)
  * Fixing invalid default step value for QSpinBox widgets (sentry)
  * Trying to prevent the accessing of 2 occasionally uninitialized vars (sentry issue)
  * Adding a "Select a Color" context menu for color keyframes, so it's still possible to change animation interpolations, remove keyframes, etc... on a color keyframe. Double clicking the color still works the same though.
  * Adding some protection around certain timeline JS bounding box operations (Sentry.io errors)
  * Fixing a bug when detecting libopenshot version mismatch. We can't access app.show_errors in the exception handler, since app fails to initialize.
  * Update version to 2.6.0; Requires libopenshot 0.2.6 SO 20
  * Adding a few more updated translations
  * Making the ZMQ logger better protected, and more able to shut down itself... so we don't get stuck on program exit waiting forever for a ZMQ polling event.
  * Setting a new default simple layout
  * Optimising the opt-in / opt-out process, so we can capture the initial launch anonymously, and then opt-out the user and prompt them to opt back in. Essentially this is the same as before, except we get the initial launch analytic (to help us better report on our usage and market share). All subsequent tracking is disabled until the user opts in.
  * Fixing tutorial positioning (which sometimes doesn't work correctly, leaving the tutorial window in the upper right corner)
  * Adding sentry error rates on our openshot.org version request... so we can adjust them dynamically (stable vs unstable versions).

  * codacy comparison
  * codacy changes
  * codacy, and redraw on resize

  * Fixing a regression on Export dialog, where we were not correctly applying FrameMapper's to all the clips.. causing audio desync, timing issues with Clips, audio pitch issues
  * Add a new link widget to our preprocessing effect dialog, so we can give further instructions/link to users who want to download the object detector dependencies.

  * Well tested prime factoring
  * Updating expander icon, and adding new cache images
  * draw tick marks but overlaps sometimes
  * Fixing race condition on Export dialog, which would invoke timeline.ApplyMapperToClips() after the export had begun... usually introducing a glitch into the 1st 10 frames written to the video file (when exporting to a different framerate)
  * Updating effect icons (also including @2x versions for high DPI screens)
  * WIP saving

  * Logging overhaul, to solve issues caused by stdout/stderr redirection (#4175)
  * Adding sentry_sdk
  * Initial integration of Sentry tracing, to better track stack-traces and bugs in OpenShot. Removing the old hooks and HTTP posts to openshot.org, since they would be redundant. Sentry is still gated behind our 'send_metrics' setting, just like before.

  * Ignoring openshot_qt
  * Removed Debug Statements
  * Removed openshot_qt folder
  * Fixed. Removing Debug Statements

  * The precision (digits after decimal point) is now adjusted automatically
  * Change the display (precision) of the progress bar during export depending on how long the last display ago was done. Also display at least every second. This should help users to recognise that the export is still ongoing when the ecoder is slow and the clip is long. Needs more fine tuning and a method that combines the output that is now done at various locations in the code
  * Updating translations, including a 100% complete Scottish Gaelic translation!
  * Make the interface for interlace more consistent
  * New preset file for h265 codec in an mkv container. Interlace is only supported in a view codec in some containers and as far as I could see the mov container only supports it with mpeg2. The mkv container supports more resent codecs like mpeg4, h264 and h265.
  * Include an option to chose between top field first and bottom field first in interlace mode. Much more work needed.
  * This is so far the only preset that exports interlace. It may be that only mpeg2 in a mov container can do this in this version of ffmpeg.
  * Honour the interlace setting
  * Update src/windows/export.py
  * Updating translations, including a 100% complete Tamil translation!
  * Ability to not store the history in the project

  * Add new signal for updating a file (such as editing a title), that results in the files_model updating the thumbnail, updating the name, and/or updating the tags.
  * Adding no-cache paramater support for thumbnail HTTP server, so it will ignore cache and re-generate a thumbnail image

  * Shortening 'group filter' name for emojis to 1-word, updating translations to match
  * Updating cache, removing many cached emoji
  * Added script to "optimize emojis" and remove extra/unused ones, and updated translations to only use optimized emojis. This results in 936 emojis shipped with OpenShot, and less translations, faster loading, etc...
  * Removing extra emojis for performance reasons

  * Updated emoji model proxy filter to be waaay faster, using Qt regex.
  * Hack to fix Travis failure
  * Fixing emoji listview currentIndexChanged connection, since it passes an INT also
  * Create 8 custom cursors, white middles with black stroke, for Transform tool. Added custom cursor rotation, as the transform is happening in real-time. Feel great, very polished.

  * mangle-hw-libs.sh: Remove math expression (#3344)
  * Added error handling to Preset and Profile file reading operations
  * Adding emojis from open-moji project.
  * Adding emojis to translation template. Splitting "transitions" and "emojis" into separate templates though, since there are thousands of them, and they are not critical for OpenShot to be usefully translated.
  * Adding @emojis path replacement, when saving and loading *.osp files. This allows them to be cross-platform paths, and relative/magic paths for OpenShot which always work.
  * Added emoji group drop-down filter, to better sort and filter, and a custom Proxy class for filtering. Also enabled locale aware sorting on listview and treeviews.
  * Process qt events every 2 files added (so emoji doesn't glitch when adding to timeline)
  * Convert effects to no longer delete widgets, but rather share a model, and toggle between list and tree view.
  * Convert transitions to no longer delete widgets, but rather create both with a shared model, and toggle visibility to the user.
  * Convert files to use new proxy class, and a global shared model. No longer delete the tree/list view widgets either. They both always exist, and share the same data, and toggle visibility back and forth. Added wait cursor when adding/importing files.
  * Convert effects model to use proxy class for sorting and filtering.
  * Convert transitions model to use proxy filter and sort class, with custom sort and filter function (which takes into account the group: common, extra, user) and the filter text. Also, moved the models outside of the widgets for Effects, Transitions, and Emojis.
  * Initial checkin of emojis in OpenShot! Added new model/view/ui elements, and a handful of test emojis from OpenMoji.

  * Sync add_file() in file views
  * Allow *.osp project files to be imported as a Clip. Better handle unknown "media_type"'s.  Trigger "has unsaved changes" when clearing history from a Project, so the user can immediately save the *.osp file without history.
