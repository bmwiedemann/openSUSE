Fri Feb 21 15:55:04 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.21.1:
  * This enables compilation for 32bit systems.
    I never intended to support 32bit properly; so, this version allows
    compilation for 32bit systems with many warnings.
    For Linux you need the -m32 flag. Run export CXXFLAGS="-m32" and
    export CXXFLAGS="-m32" before running cmake.
    To have TIFF support, you need the 32bit TIFF library. #181
  * Update CMakeLists.txt for config file naming convention in #180

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb  3 07:10:19 UTC 2025 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.21.0:
  * Added lossy compression to data samples that are originally floating
    point numbers, and that are undergoing non-linear type3 transform,
    which stored with the help of the NLT marker segment.
  * Better support for components with differing properties; these
    involve using the QCC and COC marker segments.  These are exposed
    using the API, but not in the applications.
  * OpenJPH can now be added using cmake's find_package().
  * For WASM, cmake configuration now generates one version only, with
    SIMD support; this support can be disabled through a command line option.
  * Fixes a bug when a resolution has one 64bit line. #162
  * Makes all colour components involved in colour transform employ the sâ€¦ #163
  * Allow OpenJPH to be exported #166
  * Supporting differing components in QCD #169
  * Adding NLT implementation to the lossy path #170
  * This adds support for COC. #172
  * Add support for find_package(), clean-up EMCC support and clean-up TIFF support #173
  * Adding Support for WASM without SIMD. #174
  * This is a better way of packet header parsing. #176
  * Support for lossy floating point with NLT segment marker. #178

  This addresses the illegal instruction issue when -flto flag is used
  (link time optimization) as details in this thread:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2307795
  See #160

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 27 08:19:24 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.18.0:
  * This release adds support for 32bit lossless compression of integer and
    floating-point data, where floating-point data can benefit from the
    non-linear (NLT) segment marker, which represent negative values in a more
    compression-friendly format.
    This required the addition of 64 bit processing path for lossless
    compression, which is automatically employed if needed.
  * This version also addresses issue #157, which causes illegal instruction
    fault on machines that do not support AVX or more recent instruction sets,
    when the code in compiled with clang and in the Release mode only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 23 07:06:05 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.17.0:
  * Adding support for NLT marker segment of type 3.
    The code is not very complete, but it is in a useful state
    for publishing.  To make use of the NLT marker segment for
    type 3, partial support for the .pfm file format has been added.
    For .pfm files, lossy compression is not supported -- it is
    possible to add support at some future point.  Reversible coding
    of .pfm files is supported, where the NLT marker is automatically inserted.
    However, the current implementation supports only 28-bit
    for encoding 27-bit for decoding.  Therefore floating point
    values stored in a .pfm file, which are 32-bit, need to be truncated.
    Using the '-bit_depth' option, ojph_compress can perform this truncation.
    'ojph_compress' should work correctly with codestreams generated
    with ojph_compress, converting truncated values
    back to normal floating point values.
  * Adding support for NLT marker segment of type 3 #154

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 06:25:16 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.16.0:
  * Add AVX2 support for block encoding and decoding.
  * Fix what I think is a bug in AVX512 block encoding.
  * Add avx2 optimization for encoder and decoder #153.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 22 08:29:48 UTC 2024 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.15.0:
  * This addresses a few small issues #146, #147, and #148.
    The most important changes are:
  * Added "-fexceptions" flag to subprojects/js/CMakeLists.txt, which I forgot to do.
  * Added a function "set_message_level()" to ojph_message.h, which
    controls the severity level at which info/warn/error messages are printed.
    By adjusting the message level, users can tailor the verbosity of the
    output to their specific needs.

      when building for WASM.
