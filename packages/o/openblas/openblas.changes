- Update to version 0.3.4
  common:
    * The new, experimental thread-local memory allocation had
      inadvertently been left enabled for gmake builds in 0.3.3
      despite the announcement. It is now disabled by default,
      and single-threaded builds will keep using the old
      allocator even if the USE_TLS option is turned on.
    * OpenBLAS will now provide enough buffer space for at least
      50 threads by default.
    * The output of openblas_get_config() now contains the version

      a fork if needed before handling a call to
      openblas_set_num_threads
    * Accesses to parallelized level3 functions from multiple
      callers are now serialized to avoid thread races
      (unless using OpenMP).
    * This should provide better performance than the
      known-threadsafe (but non-default)
      USE_SIMPLE_THREADED_LEVEL3 option.
    * When building LAPACK with gfortran, -frecursive is now
      (again) enabled by default to ensure correct behaviour.
    * The OpenBLAS version cblas.h now supports both CBLAS_ORDER
      and CBLAS_LAYOUT as the name of the matrix row/column order
      option.
    * Externally set LDFLAGS are now passed through to the final
      compile/link
    * steps to facilitate setting platform-specific linker flags.
    * A potential race condition during the build of LAPACK
      (that would usually manifest itself as a failure to build
      TESTING/MATGEN) has been fixed.
    * xHEMV has been changed to stay single-threaded for small
      input sizes where the overhead of multithreading exceeds
      any possible gains
    * CSWAP and ZSWAP have been limited to a single thread
      except on ARMV8 or ThunderX hardware with sizable input.
    * Linker flags for the PGI compiler have been updated
    * Behaviour of AXPY with zero increments is now handled
      in the C interface, correcting the result on at least
      Intel Atom.

      input matrix is now zeroed completely.
  x86_64:
    * Autodetection of AMD Ryzen2 has been fixed (again).

      build of the library with the _64 suffix.

      AVX512 SGEMM kernel has been sped up by rewriting
      with C intrinsics
    * Fixed compilation on RHEL5/CENTOS5 
      (issue with typename __WAIT_STATUS)
  armv8:
    * DYNAMic_ARCH support is now available for 64bit ARM
    * cross-compiling for ARMV8 under iOS now works.
    * cpu-specific code has been rearranged to make better
      use of both hardware commonalities and model-specific
      compiler optimizations.
    * XGENE1 has been removed as a TARGET, superseded by the
      improved generic ARMV8 support.
  armv7:
    * Older assembly mnemonics have been converted to UAL
      form to allow building with clang 7.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct  9 19:00:49 UTC 2018 - Dmitry Roshchin <dmitry_r@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.3.3 
  common:

      used before version 0.3.1 due to unexpected problems caused by
      the new code under some circumstances.
    * LAPACK PR272 has been integrated, which fixes spurious errors
      in DSYEVR and related functions caused by missing conversion
      from ILAENV to ILAENV_2STAGE in several _2stage routines.
  x86_64
    * added AVX512 implementations of SDOT, DDOT, SAXPY, DAXPY,
      DSCAL, DGEMVN and DSYMVL

      be supported via the slower PRESCOTT kernels when this option
      is not set)
    * Added an option DYNAMIC_LIST that (used in conjunction with
      DYNAMIC_ARCH) allows to specify the list of x86_64 targets to
