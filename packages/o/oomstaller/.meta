  <title>A tool for suppressing swap thrashing at build time</title>
  <description>Oomstaller is a tool for suppressing swap thrashing at build time. It is
intended for use in build processes of large processes, using parallelism to
make use of available CPUs. It works by monitoring memory usage of each process
when performing a build, and suspends processes as necessary to prevent
swapping from occurring.</description>
