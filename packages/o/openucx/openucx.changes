-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 13 12:45:34 UTC 2018 - nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com

- Remove libnuma-devel on s390x for older releases

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 27 07:12:37 UTC 2018 - nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com

- Add UCT-UD-fixed-compilation-by-gcc8.patch to fix compilation
  with GCC8 (bsc#1084635)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use right documentation path.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 19 10:12:04 UTC 2018 - nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com

- Update to 1.2.2
  - Support including UCX API headers from C++ code
  - UD transport to handle unicast flood on RoCE fabric
  - Compilation fixes for gcc 7.1.1, clang 3.6, clang 5
  - When UD transport is used with RoCE, packets intended for other peers may
    arrive on different adapters (as a result of unicast flooding).
  - This change adds packet filtering based on destination GIDs. Now the packet
    is silently dropped, if its destination GID does not match the local GID.
  - Added a new device ID for InfiniBand HCA

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  8 21:19:11 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

  built with this enabled. Removing the BR causes no regression in
  the package but eliminates a build cycle
  boost -> curl -> doxygen -> openucx -> boost
