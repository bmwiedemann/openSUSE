  <description>Optimize your images with OptiImage, a useful image compressor that supports
PNG, JPEG, WebP and SVG file types.

It supports both lossless and lossy compression modes with an option whether to
keep or not metadata of images. It additionally has a safe mode, where a new
image is created instead of overwriting the old one.

It uses the following tools:

    oxipng for PNG images
    jpegoptim for JPEG images
    scour for SVG images
    cwebp for WebP images</description>
