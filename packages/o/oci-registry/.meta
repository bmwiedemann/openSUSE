  <title>oci-registry is an implementation of the OCI Registry spec with filesystem and S3 storage back-ends.</title>
  <description>Features

- Pull-through cache for _any_ registry, not just docker.io
	- This includes private, authenticated registries.  **This means that you can create an unauthenticated mirror of a private registry and expose it to the Internet.  Easily.  Don't do that.**
- Two storage back-ends
	- S3
	- Local filesystem
- Small footprint; in my test system, the official `registry` uses approximately 130 MiB of memory to mirror docker.io; five replicas of `oci-registry` combined use approximately 60 MiB to mirror everything in [example.yaml](example.yaml), plus one private registry.  CPU is negligible for both.</description>
