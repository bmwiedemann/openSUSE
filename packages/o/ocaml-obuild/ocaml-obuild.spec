%description
A parallel, incremental and declarative build system for OCaml.
Obuild acts as a building black box: users only declare what they want to
build and with which sources; the build system will consistently build it.
The design is based on Haskell's Cabal and borrows most of the layout and
way of working, adapting parts where necessary to fully support OCaml.
