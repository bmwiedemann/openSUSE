- Update to 0.16
  * The commentary from 11/05/2018 was wrong. The constraints were not
    reset to their natural order and remained randomized.
    The other thing that was missing was full contraint reorder without 
    separation into independent and dependent ones. The algorithm doesn't
    converge without it well.
  * An incorrect optimization to Jacobian Copy building code from #1938
    that resulted in corrupt data in multi-threaded execution mode was 
    fixed.
  * An unintended change from commit #1898 has been reverted.
    The QuickStep used to solve with randomized constraint order 
    each 8th iteration. The other iterations, the constraints 
    were reset to their natural order, as generated, with the dependent
    constraints gathered in reverse order at end (the reverse order is 
    somehow important). With the commit #1898 the constraints were
    randomly reordered each 8th iteration but then remained 
    in that randomized order and only were re-randomized on subsequent
    multiples of 8.
  * CMake support for project file generation has been added.
  * dxHashSpace::collide() has been changed to fault host program 
    if scene gets too large and causes integer overflow.
  * Memory and pointer size integer type use has been changed so that 
    internal typedefs are used instead of "_t" suffixed types.
  * Introduction of cooperative algorithms API. 
    L*D*LT cooperative factorization and linear equation system 
    cooperative solving have been implemented.
  * AtomicReadReorderBarrier, AtomicStore, AtomicStorePointer functions 
    have been added and some atomic function implementations have been 
    improved in OU.
- adjusted ode-iso-cpp.patch
- build with --enable-double-precision

  * Changed: Trimesh-Convex edge contact normals have been changed
    to retain their inclination along edges as generated by libCCD
  * Changed: A finer control over OU features implemented and OU
    basic features have been made available by default
  * Fixed: An access beyond the edges array has been fixed in the
    case if last edge was a boundary one
  * Fixed: A bug fixed with HashSpace calling big boxes collision
    twice (both straight and reverse geometries order)

  * Stable, implicit gyroscopic forces.
  * New joint: transmission joint.
  * Contacts now have rolling friction.

- License tag was fixed. Thanks to @AndreasStieger.
- BuildRequires tags were fixed up.
- Project should have the same name as upstream & pkgconfig.

Sun Feb 19 23:22:59 UTC 2012 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Use proper LIBS variable for slipping in X11
  (Libs in LDFLAGS may not have any effect due to importance of
  linking order)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 13:19:06 UTC 2011 - jengelh@medozas.de

- Remove redundant/unwanted tags/section (cf. specfile guidelines)
- Call configure properly to put libs where they are supposed to be
- Use %_smp_mflags for parallel building
- Produce shared libraries

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 19 20:28:13 UTC 2011 - seife+obs@b1-systems.com

- update to 0.11.1
  * lots of new functions and bugfixes, see CHANGELOG.txt
  * add pkgconfig file

Mon Aug 11 10:49:17 CEST 2008 - sndirsch@suse.de

- update to 0.10.1
  * New function: dJointSetPistonAnchorOffset
  * Add new function dJointSetHingeAxisDelta
  * Fix problem with dJointGetPistonPosition and
    dJointGetPistonPositionRate when the joint is attached to only
    a body 2. The sign was inversed. 
  * Update the slider joint to have the same behavior as the other
    joint when there is only a body2 attached to it.
  * Rename the new function dJointSetHingeAxisDelta to
    dJointSetHingeAxisOffset. This will remove confusion with the
    old function dJointSetHingeAnchorDelta.
  * Bug fix: Max Correcting Vel behavior is now the same as before
    0.10.
