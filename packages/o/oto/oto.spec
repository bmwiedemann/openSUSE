%description
The 'Open Type Organizer' project provides programs to list and modify
tables in OpenType font files, specifically, their 'name' and 'cmap'
tables.  It can be used to translate 'name' and 'cmap' of OpenType font
in locale encodings to Unicode encoding so the font file can be used in
an environment which does not understand locale encodings.  The
translated tables are added to the font while keeping the original
tables intact.

Do you have a True Type font which does not work with Xft (e.g. with
KDE and Antialiasing)? Chances are, the font doesn't have a Unicode
'cmap'!  Open Type Organizer (oTo) will help to solve the problem.  It
will add Unicode 'name' and Unicode 'cmap' tables by translating the
original ones.	Your favorite ttf font can really work for you now.
