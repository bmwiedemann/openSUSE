  + Only check for Android's liblog on Android targets, so we don't
    accidentally pick up another liblog that may exist elsewhere.
  + Don't require libtool for uninstalled setups (-uninstalled
    pkg-config file).
  + Make -Bsymbolic check in configure work with clang.
  + Coverity code analyser fixes.

Tue Oct  4 07:47:08 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.16:
  + orc_init() tried to take the same mutex as generated C code
    that calls (indirectly) orc_init().
  + sse: Fixes for 64 bit pointers with any of the upper 32 bits
    set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 11:35:02 UTC 2011 - vuntz@opensuse.org

Wed Apr 27 16:02:34 UTC 2011 - chris@computersalat.de

    Altivec.
  + Add some compatibility code to mitigate the previous automatic
    inclusion of stdint.h
- Changes from version 0.4.12:
  + Fix gcc-4.6 warnings in generated code
  + Codegen fixes for Altivec. Passes regression tests again.
  + More error checking for code allocation.
  + NEON: floating point improvements
  + Removed stdint.h from API. This could theoretically cause
    breakage if you depended on orc to include stdint.h.
  + Addition of the OrcCode structure, which keeps track of
    compiled code. This now allows applications to free unused
    code.
  + x86 code generation was completely refactored to add an
    intermediate stage, which will later be used for instruction
    reordering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  8 12:43:53 UTC 2010 - cristian.rodriguez@opensuse.org

- Run make check

  + sse/mmx: Fix x2/x4 with certain opcodes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  9 11:20:19 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

  + Allocation of mmap’d areas for code now has several fallback
    methods, in order to placate various SELinux configurations.
  + Various speed improvements in SSE backend
  + Add SSE implementations of ldreslinl and ldresnearl.
  + Update Mersenne Twister example

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  6 16:08:49 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.9:
  + Added handling for 64-bit constants
  + Fix building and use of static library
  + Fix register allocation on Win64 (still partly broken, however)
  + Quiet some non-errors printed by orcc in 0.4.8.
  + Fix implementation of several opcodes.
  + Until this release, the shared libraries all had the same
    versioning information. This should be fixed going forward.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 30 17:36:41 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.8:
  + Fix Windows and OS/X builds
  + Improve behavior in failure cases
  + Major improvements for Altivec backend
  + Significant documentation additions
  + Memory for executable code storage is now handled in a much
    more controlled manner, and it's now possible to reclaim this
    memory after it's no longer needed.
  + A few more 64-bit opcodes have been added, mostly related to
    arithmetic on floating point values.
  + The orcc tool now handles 64-bit and floating point parameters
    and constants.
- Add baselibs.conf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 26 12:01:02 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.7:
  + Lots of specialized new opcodes and opcode prefixes.
  + Important fixes for ARM backend
  + Improved emulation of programs (much faster)
  + Implemented fallback rules for almost all opcodes for SSE and
    NEON backends
  + Performance improvements for SSE and NEON backends.
  + Many fixes to make larger programs compile properly.
  + 64-bit data types are now fully implemented, although there are
    few operations on them.
  + Loads and stores are now handled by separate opcodes (loadb,
    storeb, etc). For compatibility, these are automatically
    included where necessary. This allowed new specialized loading
    opcodes, for example, resampling a source array for use in
    scaling images.
  + Opcodes may now be prefixed by "x2" or "x4", indicating that a
    operation should be done on 2 or 4 parts of a proportionally
    larger value. For example, "x4 addusb" performs 4 saturated
    unsigned additions on each of the four bytes of 32-bit
    quantities. This is useful in pixel operations.
  + The MMX backend is now (semi-) automatically generated from the
    SSE backend.
  + The orcc tool has a new option "-inline", which creates inline
    versions of the Orc stub functions. The orcc tool also
    recognizes a new directive ‘.init’, which instructs the
    compiler to generate an initialization function, which when
    called at application init time, compiles all the generated
    functions. This allows the generated stub functions to avoid
    checking if the function has already been compiled. The use of
    these two features can dramatically decrease the cost of
    calling Orc functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  6 17:45:52 CEST 2010 - vuntz@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.4.6:
  + Various fixes to make Orc more portable
  + Major performance improvements to NEON backend
  + Minor performance improvements to SSE backend
  + Major improvements to ARM backend, now passes regression tests.
  + The defaults for floating point operations have been changed
    somewhat: NANs are handled more like the IEEE 754 standard, and
    denormals in operations are treated as zeros. The NAN changes
    causes certain SSE operations to be slightly slower, but produce
    less surprising results. Treating denormals as zero has effects
    ranging from “slightly faster” to “now possible”.
  + New tool: orc-bugreport. Mainly this is to provide a limited
    testing tool in the field, especially for embedded targets
    which would not have access to the testsuite that is not
    installed.
  + The environment variable ORC_CODE can now be used to adjust
    some code generation. See orc-bugreport -help for details.
  + orcc has a new option to generate code that is compatible with
    older versions of Orc.
  + New NEON detection relies on Linux 2.6.29 or later.
- Changes from version 0.4.5:
  + Many small improvements related to converting GStreamer from
    liboil to Orc.
  + The major addition in this release is the mainstreaming of
    the NEON backend, made possible by Nokia.
  + There is a new experimental option to ./configure,
    --enable-backend, which allows you to choose a single code
    generation backend to include in the library. This is mostly
    useful for embedded systems, and is not recommended in general.
- Do not call autogen.sh and remove workaround for doc generation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
