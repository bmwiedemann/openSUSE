  <description>The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for working with time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing. It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool. The toolbox provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and wavelet transforms along with routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients.
This is part of Octave-Forge project.</description>
