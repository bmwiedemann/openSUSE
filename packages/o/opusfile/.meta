  <description>A high-level API for decoding and seeking within .opus files

opusfile provides a high-level API for decoding and seeking within .opus files. 
It includes:
* Support for all files with at least one Opus stream 
  (including multichannel files or Ogg files where Opus is muxed with something else).
* Full support, including seeking, for chained files.
* A simple stereo downmixing API
  (allowing chained files to be decoded with a single output format, even if the channel count changes).
* Support for reading from a file, memory buffer, or over HTTP(S) (including seeking).
* Support for both random access and streaming data sources.</description>
