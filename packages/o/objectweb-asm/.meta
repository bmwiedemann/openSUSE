  <title>A code manipulation tool to implement adaptable systems</title>
  <description>ASM is a Java bytecode manipulation framework.

It can be used to dynamically generate stub classes or other proxy
classes, directly in binary form, or to dynamically modify classes at
load time, i.e., just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual
Machine.

ASM offers similar functionalities as BCEL or SERP, but is much
smaller.</description>
