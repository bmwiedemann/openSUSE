  <title>Ocaml Constraint Programming Library</title>
  <description>FaCiLe is a constraint programming library on integer and integer set
finite domains written in OCaml. It offers all usual facilities to
create and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions
and constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints
(difference, cardinality, sorting etc.) and search and optimization
goals. FaCiLe as well allows you to build easily user-defined
constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making pervasive use
of OCaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible
interface for the user. As FaCiLe is an OCaml library and not &quot;yet
another language&quot;, the user benefits from type inference and strong
typing discipline, high level of abstraction, a modules and objects
system, as well as native code compilation efficiency, garbage
collection and replay debugger, all features of OCaml (among many
others) that allow to prototype and experiment quickly: modeling, data
processing and interface are implemented with the same powerful and
efficient language.</description>
