  <title>Support for One-Time Passwords</title>
  <description>OPIE stands for One-time Passwords In Everything. One-time passwords
can be used to foil password sniffers because they cannot be reused by
the attacker.

This package provides a PAM module and several utility programs that
let you use one-time passwords for authentication.</description>
