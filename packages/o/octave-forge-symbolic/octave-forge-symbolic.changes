Thu Sep 15 00:48:38 UTC 2022 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 3.0.1:
  * New `@double` numerical functions; these are wrappers around SymPy,
    so they are slower than native floating-point implementations.
    - adjoint
  * Misc bug fixes and improvements in error handling.
  * `.oct-config` files indicate source is UTF-8 encoded and should improve
    any locale or encoding problems on Octave 7 and above.
  * Fixes some errors when Python is running in Cygwin-like environment.
    But there could still be errors in other places (issue #1182).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  8 17:26:50 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 3.0.0:
  * New symbolic commands: cumprod cumsum ztrans.
  * `dsolve` output prefers expressions (right-hand sides) rather
    than equations.  Also uses structs for systems.  This brings
    it closer to `solve` and more compatible with other symbolic
    toolboxes.
  * `dsolve` supports arrays of initial conditions.
  * Fixes for SymPy 1.6 and later.
  * Fixes for Octave 6.x and Octave 7.1.
  * Drop Python 2 support.
  * Update minimum versions of SymPy to 1.4 and Octave to 5.1.
  * Remove deprecated `evalpy` and `python_cmd` utilities.
- Update required versions of dependencies python3-sympy and
  octave in keeping with upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  7 18:13:07 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 2.9.0:
  * Default python interpreter is now `python3`.
  * Fixes for SymPy 1.5.
    + `@sym/round` changed to round-to-even.
    + fix broken EmptySet `finiteset()`.
  * Documentation updates for upcoming Octave 6.
  * If the Pythonic package is loaded, automatically use it for
    Python communication (see `help sympref` for details).
  * Deprecation notice: `python_cmd` will be removed in a future
    release.
- Switch to python3, drop python*-devel build dependency

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 16 12:02:57 UTC 2019 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 2.8.0:
  * New symbolic commands: eval ezmesh find sinc
  * Update minimum versions of SymPy to 1.2 and Octave to 4.2.
  * Fixes for SymPy 1.4.
  * Newer SymPy versions improve QR and LU on non-square matrices.
  * Support for expressions with min and max such as `min(x, y)`.
  * `subs(f)` now works: it finds values from the workspace.
  * `gammainc` now regularized correctly.
  * `lambertw` has more consistent printing.
  * Other bug fixes and documentation updates.
- Update version numbers for python-sympy and octave-cli for
  Requires and BuildRequires in keeping with upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 21 11:57:57 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.7.1:
  * New symbolic command: numdem
  * Fixes for SymPy 1.3.
  * Various bug fixes and documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 16 15:12:36 UTC 2018 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.7.0:
  * New symbolic commands: arg, euler, ezcontour
  * New `@double` numerical functions; these are wrappers around
    SymPy, so they are slower than native floating-point
    implementations: bernoulli, euler, chebyshevT, pochhammer,
    chebyshevU.
  * The initial startup is much quieter!
  * `vpa` now warns of low-precision on non-numbers strings with
    decimals such as `vpa('cos(0.1)')`. See "help vpa" for
    details.
  * `subs` allows multiple scalar variables to be replaced with
    symbolic matrix expressions.
  * symfun can be evaluated at symbolic matrices: `f(sym([1 2; 3
    4]))` now works where `f(x)` is a symfun.
  * Fixes for symfuns such as `syms N(t)` where the function name
    conflicts with a SymPy command.
  * Fixes for how assumptions interact with symfuns.
  * New command `sympref diagnose` to help debug Python/SymPy
    issues.
  * Improve `function_handle` support by supporting more
    functions.
  * Fixes for several bugs mentioning "immutable matrices".
  * `bernoulli` now works with array inputs.
  * Added a `private/defaultpython.m` to make it easier for
    distributors to control which python interpreter is used by
    default.
  * Fixes for GNU Octave 4.4.
  * Fixes for SymPy 1.2.
  * Various bug fixes and documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 18 16:06:42 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 2.6.0
  * New symbolic commands: ellipke, ellipticCE, ellipticCK,
    ellipticCPi, ellipticE, ellipticF, ellipticK, ellipticPi,
    harmonic, kroneckerDelta, pochhammer
  * New `@double` numerical functions; these are wrappers around
    SymPy, so they are slower than native floating-point
    implementations: harmonic.
  * Support for the new SymPy 1.1.1.
  * `solve` now supports vectors of equations and vectors of
    variables.
  * Better warning for `sym(0.1)`, updated docs about floating
    point.
  * Double values can now be converted to their exact rational
    value using `sym(0.1, 'f')`.  Passing `'r'` gives the current
    heuristic behaviour.  Neither raises a warning.
  * The default floating-point heuristics now check for square
    roots of integers, so `sym(sqrt(2))` should work.
  * `sym('i')` and `sym('I')` no longer create the imaginary unit:
    use `sym(i)` or `sym(1i)`.
  * `sym(e)` now gives the same as `exp(sym(1))`.  However,
    `sym('e')` and `syms e` continue to create a variable named
    `e`.
  * `sym` now accepts function handles such as anonymous functions
    as inputs.
  * `subs` is not approriate for numerical evaluation; add an
    example in `help subs` which shows how to do this with
    `function_handle`.
  * Calling `sym(cell)` now creates a sym array instead of a cell
    array. Old behaviour of creating a cell array was deprecated
    in 2.5.0.
  * Bug fix: isequal(n) for symfun's correctly tests the argnames.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  7 19:48:42 UTC 2016 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.4.0
  * New symbolic commands:
    acsc, csch, gammaln, polylog, asec, dilog, hypergeom, psi,
    asech, ei, hypot, resize, besseljn, expint, igamma, sech,
    besselyn, ezsurf, jordan, signIm, cat, fresnelc, laguerreL,
    sinint, cosint, fresnels, lgamma, sinhint, coshint, gammainc,
    logint, ssinint
  * Move some functions from the "specfun" package:
    dirac, heaviside, laguerreL, lambertw
  * Re-implement @double/laguerreL for numerical stability.
  * Add spherical Bessel functions: these are called `besseljn` and
    `besselyn`.

- Update to version 2.2.1
  * New commands:
    catalan eulergamma lambertw
  * Installing symbolic package now check for Python and minimum
    version of SymPy.
  * Installations from Octave-Forge ("pkg install -forge symbolic")
    should now work on Windows (thanks vassbu).  You will need the
    Python and SymPy dependencies.  Or you can use the [bundled
    package](https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy/releases)
  * Added support for Python 3 (still works with Python 2 as well).
  * Documentation improvements especially to assumptions.  Examples
    within documentation can now be tested with doctests, see the
    `octsympy_doctests.m` function.
  * Fix a warning on Octave 4.0.0-rc1 and make tests work properly.
  * Other bug fixes: assumptions; symvar and symbolic matrix powers;
    various display issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  9 07:51:59 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.0
  * New commands: columns, degree, formula, ismatrix, numden, rows

    compatibility with other symbolic toolboxes.

  * Improvements to "argnames" and "formula" for the dependent
    variables and dependent expression of a symfun.
