%description
To set up a printer configuration a printer description file
(PPD file) is required.

A printer description file is not a driver.

For non-PostScript printers a driver is needed
together with a PPD file which matches exactly
to the particular driver.

For PostScript printers, a PPD file alone is sufficient
(except for older PostScript level 1 printer models).

The PPD files are provided in the following sub-packages
depending on which kind of driver software is needed:

OpenPrintingPPDs-ghostscript provides PPDs
which use Ghostscript built-in drivers.

OpenPrintingPPDs-hpijs provides PPDs
which use the hpijs driver from HPLIP.

OpenPrintingPPDs-postscript provides PPDs
which need no driver.

%package postscript
Summary:        PPD files from OpenPrinting.org for PostScript printers
# Regardless that PPD files for PostScript printers do not require a driver
# many PPD files from OpenPrinting.org for PostScript printers still
# require the foomatic-rip filter which does not call 'gs' or another real driver program
# but inserts PostScript snippets from the PPD at the beginning of the PostScript data.
# This version is no typo because the PPDs are created at OpenPrinting.org

# - Add a line-feed to the end of all PPDs to fix those PPDs where it is missing.
#   See Novell/Suse Bugzilla bug #309832: Unix/Linux text files must end with a line-feed.
#   Otherwise reading the last line results EOF and then some programs may ignore the last line.
# - Only keep files which are really PPD files (test file's output).
# - Only keep files which are of '*LanguageVersion: English'.
# - Remove PPDs which use an non-Ghostscript external driver filter program.
# - Remove whitespaces (except \n) from lines which contain only whitespaces
#   ('\n \n' is not allowed but '\n\n' is).

# Final test by cupstestppd:
# Keep all PPDs even if cupstestppd FAILs.
# Reason:
# With each CUPS version upgrade cupstestppd finds more and more errors
# so that more and more PPDs would be no longer included in the RPM
# which have been included before which results a regression.
# As far as we know there have been no problems at all because of
# not strictly compliant PPDs so that it is much better
# to provide all PPDs so that the matching printers can be used
# than to be rigorous regarding enforcing compliance to the PPD specification:
