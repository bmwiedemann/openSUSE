  <title>PPD files from OpenPrinting.org</title>
  <description>To set up a printer configuration a printer description file
(PPD file) is required.

A printer description file is not a driver.

For non-PostScript printers a driver is needed
together with a PPD file which matches exactly
to the particular driver.

For PostScript printers, a PPD file alone is sufficient
(except for older PostScript level 1 printer models).

The PPD files are provided in the following sub-packages
depending on which kind of driver software is needed:

OpenPrintingPPDs-ghostscript provides PPDs
which use Ghostscript built-in drivers.

OpenPrintingPPDs-hpijs provides PPDs
which use the hpijs driver from HPLIP.

OpenPrintingPPDs-postscript provides PPDs
which need no driver.</description>
