- Moved ocaml-findlib.rpm.prov_req.attr.sh from ocaml to provide
  ocamlfind() in ocaml itself
- Handle license separately because sed w truncates output

  used at runtime. Also, cmxs dependencies in main pkg are
  not covered by ocaml-find-requires.sh (bsc#1154874)

- Pass --for-release-of-packages to dune via dune_release_pkgs=
- Print potential BuildRequires during build
- Package sml for camlp5
- SLE_12 has still no license macro, package as doc instead
