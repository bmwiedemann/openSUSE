  <title>A binary protocol generator</title>
  <description>This library contains functionality for reading and writing OCaml-values in a
type-safe binary protocol.  It is extremely efficient, typically supporting
type-safe marshalling and unmarshalling of even highly structured values at
speeds sufficient to saturate a gigabit connection.  The protocol is also
heavily optimized for size, making it ideal for long-term storage of large
amounts of data.
