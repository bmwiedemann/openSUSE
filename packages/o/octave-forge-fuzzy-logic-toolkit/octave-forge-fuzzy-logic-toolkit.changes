- Update to version 0.6.2
  * Redefined the defuzz option "centroid" using a more efficient
    method (weighted average), and renamed the previous "centroid"
    implementation "centroid_integral" (because it is an
    integral-based calculation) in order to continue to provide the
    integral-based option.
- Update to version 0.6.1
  * Improved many comments and updated the html documentation.
- Update to version 0.6.0
  * Added many built-in self tests, simplified error messages, and
    made minor improvements to comments.
  * Reimplemented two private functions: square_distance_matrix.m
    and update_cluster_membership.m.  Tested for identical results
    with previous implementation using an embedded test in each file.
  * Added new docs directory containing html documentation for each
    top-level function.
- Update to version 0.5.1
  * Updated several top-level text files (ChangeLog, DESCRIPTION, and
    NEWS). No change to any code.
- Update to version 0.5.0
  * Replaced several occurrences of the deprecated '.+' and '.-'
    operators with '+' and '-', respectively.
