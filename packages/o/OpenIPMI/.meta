  <description>OpenIPMI is an effort to create a full-function IPMI system to allow
full access to all IPMI information on a server and to abstract it to a
level that makes it easy to use.

OpenIPMI consists of two main parts: a device driver that is included
in the Linux kernel and a user-level library that provides a
higher-level abstraction of IPMI and generic services that can be used
on any operation system. This package contains the user-level library
part. This OpenIPMI library also includes the ipmicmd program, a small
program that lets you inject and receive messages.</description>
