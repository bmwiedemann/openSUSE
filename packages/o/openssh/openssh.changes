Wed Nov 11 20:05:27 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Fix build breakage caused by missing security key objects:
  + Modify openssh-7.7p1-cavstest-ctr.patch.
  + Modify openssh-7.7p1-cavstest-kdf.patch.
  + Add openssh-link-with-sk.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 18:27:55 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Add openssh-fips-ensure-approved-moduli.patch (bsc#1177939).
  This ensures only approved DH parameters are used in FIPS mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 18:27:54 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Add openssh-8.1p1-ed25519-use-openssl-rng.patch (bsc#1173799).
  This uses OpenSSL's RAND_bytes() directly instead of the internal
  ChaCha20-based implementation to obtain random bytes for Ed25519
  curve computations. This is required for FIPS compliance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  8 21:38:27 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Work around %service_add_post disabling sshd on upgrade with
  package name change (bsc#1177039).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 13:40:51 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fix fillup-template usage:
  + %post server needs to reference ssh (not sshd), which matches
    the sysconfig.ssh file name the package ships.
  + %post client does not need any fillup_ calls, as there is no
    client-relevant sysconfig file present. The naming of the
    sysconfig file (ssh instead of sshd) is unfortunate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 10:59:50 UTC 2020 - Franck Bui <fbui@suse.com>

- Use of DISABLE_RESTART_ON_UPDATE is deprecated.

  Replace it with %service_del_postun_without_restart

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 20:41:39 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Move some Requires to the right subpackage.
- Avoid ">&" bashism in %post.
- Upgrade some old specfile constructs/macros and drop unnecessary
  %{?systemd_*}.
- Trim descriptions and straighten out the grammar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 10 21:38:30 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Split openssh package into openssh, openssh-common,
  openssh-server and openssh-clients. This allows for the ssh
  clients to be installed without the server component
  (bsc#1176434).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  5 00:36:08 UTC 2020 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Version update to 8.3p1:
  = Potentially-incompatible changes
  * sftp(1): reject an argument of "-1" in the same way as ssh(1) and
    scp(1) do instead of accepting and silently ignoring it.

  = New features
  * sshd(8): make IgnoreRhosts a tri-state option: "yes" to ignore
    rhosts/shosts, "no" allow rhosts/shosts or (new) "shosts-only"
    to allow .shosts files but not .rhosts.
  * sshd(8): allow the IgnoreRhosts directive to appear anywhere in a
    sshd_config, not just before any Match blocks.
  * ssh(1): add %TOKEN percent expansion for the LocalFoward and
    RemoteForward keywords when used for Unix domain socket forwarding.
  * all: allow loading public keys from the unencrypted envelope of a
    private key file if no corresponding public key file is present.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): prefer to use chacha20 from libcrypto where
    possible instead of the (slower) portable C implementation included
    in OpenSSH.
  * ssh-keygen(1): add ability to dump the contents of a binary key
    revocation list via "ssh-keygen -lQf /path".

- Additional changes from 8.2p1 release:
  = Potentially-incompatible changes
  * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-keygen(1): this release removes the "ssh-rsa"
    (RSA/SHA1) algorithm from those accepted for certificate signatures
    (i.e. the client and server CASignatureAlgorithms option) and will
    use the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm by default when the
    ssh-keygen(1) CA signs new certificates.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): this release removes diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
    from the default key exchange proposal for both the client and
    server.
  * ssh-keygen(1): the command-line options related to the generation
    and screening of safe prime numbers used by the
    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-* key exchange algorithms have
    changed. Most options have been folded under the -O flag.
  * sshd(8): the sshd listener process title visible to ps(1) has
    changed to include information about the number of connections that
    are currently attempting authentication and the limits configured
    by MaxStartups.
  * ssh-sk-helper(8): this is a new binary. It is used by the FIDO/U2F
    support to provide address-space isolation for token middleware
    libraries (including the internal one). It needs to be installed
    in the expected path, typically under /usr/libexec or similar.

  = New features
  * This release adds support for FIDO/U2F hardware authenticators to
    OpenSSH. U2F/FIDO are open standards for inexpensive two-factor
    authentication hardware that are widely used for website
    authentication.  In OpenSSH FIDO devices are supported by new public
    key types "ecdsa-sk" and "ed25519-sk", along with corresponding
    certificate types.
  * sshd(8): add an Include sshd_config keyword that allows including
    additional configuration files via glob(3) patterns.
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): make the LE (low effort) DSCP code point available
    via the IPQoS directive.
  * ssh(1): when AddKeysToAgent=yes is set and the key contains no
    comment, add the key to the agent with the key's path as the
    comment.
  * ssh-keygen(1), ssh-agent(1): expose PKCS#11 key labels and X.509
    subjects as key comments, rather than simply listing the PKCS#11
    provider library path.
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow PEM export of DSA and ECDSA keys.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): make zlib compile-time optional, available via the
    Makefile.inc ZLIB flag on OpenBSD or via the --with-zlib configure
    option for OpenSSH portable.
  * sshd(8): when clients get denied by MaxStartups, send a
    notification prior to the SSH2 protocol banner according to
    RFC4253 section 4.2.
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): when invoking the $SSH_ASKPASS prompt
    program, pass a hint to the program to describe the type of
    desired prompt.  The possible values are "confirm" (indicating
    that a yes/no confirmation dialog with no text entry should be
    shown), "none" (to indicate an informational message only), or
    blank for the original ssh-askpass behaviour of requesting a
    password/phrase.
  * ssh(1): allow forwarding a different agent socket to the path
    specified by $SSH_AUTH_SOCK, by extending the existing ForwardAgent
    option to accepting an explicit path or the name of an environment
    variable in addition to yes/no.
  * ssh-keygen(1): add a new signature operations "find-principals" to
    look up the principal associated with a signature from an allowed-
    signers file.
  * sshd(8): expose the number of currently-authenticating connections
    along with the MaxStartups limit in the process title visible to
    "ps".

- Add openssh-8.1p1-use-openssl-kdf.patch (jsc#SLE-9443). This
  performs key derivation using OpenSSL's SSHKDF facility, which
  allows OpenSSH to benefit from the former's FIPS certification
  status.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 21 04:49:22 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

  glibc master implements multiple functions using that syscall making
  the privsep sandbox kill the preauth process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 17 06:23:58 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Update openssh-7.7p1-audit.patch to fix crash (bsc#1152730). Fix
  by Enzo Matsumiya (ematsumiya@suse.com). This was integrated in
  a separate code stream merged with the Oct. 10 update; the patch
  was also rebased and renamed to openssh-8.1p1-audit.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 23:58:39 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Add openssh-7.9p1-keygen-preserve-perms.patch (bsc#1150574).
  This attempts to preserve the permissions of any existing
  known_hosts file when modified by ssh-keygen (for instance,
  with -R).
- Added openssh-7.9p1-revert-new-qos-defaults.patch, which reverts
  an upstream commit that caused compatibility issues with other
  software (bsc#1136402).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 23:56:42 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Run 'ssh-keygen -A' on startup only if SSHD_AUTO_KEYGEN="yes"
  in /etc/sysconfig/ssh. This is set to "yes" by default, but
  can be changed by the system administrator (bsc#1139089).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 23:50:04 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Add openssh-7.9p1-keygen-preserve-perms.patch (bsc#1150574).
  This attempts to preserve the permissions of any existing
  known_hosts file when modified by ssh-keygen (for instance,
  with -R).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 10 00:41:18 UTC 2019 - Hans Petter Jansson <hpj@suse.com>

- Version update to 8.1p1:
  * ssh-keygen(1): when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
    an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
    Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
    with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
    overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").
  * ssh(1): Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
    default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
    "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"
  * ssh-keygen(1): add an experimental lightweight signature and
    verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
    held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
    authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
    namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
    usage domains (e.g. files vs email).
  * ssh-keygen(1): print key comment when extracting public key from a
    private key.
  * ssh-keygen(1): accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
    in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
    host's random-art signature too.
  * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
    keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
    but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
    non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
    key derivation function than PEM's.

- Additional changes from 8.0p1 release:
  * scp(1): Add "-T" flag to disable client-side filtering of
    server file list.
  * sshd(8): Remove support for obsolete "host/port" syntax.
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), ssh-add(1): Add support for ECDSA keys in
    PKCS#11 tokens.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Add experimental quantum-computing resistant
    key exchange method, based on a combination of Streamlined NTRU
    Prime 4591^761 and X25519.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Increase the default RSA key size to 3072 bits,
    following NIST Special Publication 800-57's guidance for a
    128-bit equivalent symmetric security level.
  * ssh(1): Allow "PKCS11Provider=none" to override later instances of
    the PKCS11Provider directive in ssh_config,
  * sshd(8): Add a log message for situations where a connection is
    dropped for attempting to run a command but a sshd_config
    ForceCommand=internal-sftp restriction is in effect.
  * ssh(1): When prompting whether to record a new host key, accept
    the key fingerprint as a synonym for "yes". This allows the user
    to paste a fingerprint obtained out of band at the prompt and
    have the client do the comparison for you.
  * ssh-keygen(1): When signing multiple certificates on a single
    command-line invocation, allow automatically incrementing the
    certificate serial number.
  * scp(1), sftp(1): Accept -J option as an alias to ProxyJump on
    the scp and sftp command-lines.
  * ssh-agent(1), ssh-pkcs11-helper(8), ssh-add(1): Accept "-v"
    command-line flags to increase the verbosity of output; pass
    verbose flags though to subprocesses, such as ssh-pkcs11-helper
    started from ssh-agent.
  * ssh-add(1): Add a "-T" option to allowing testing whether keys in
    an agent are usable by performing a signature and a verification.
  * sftp-server(8): Add a "lsetstat@openssh.com" protocol extension
    that replicates the functionality of the existing SSH2_FXP_SETSTAT
    operation but does not follow symlinks.
  * sftp(1): Add "-h" flag to chown/chgrp/chmod commands to request
    they do not follow symlinks.
  * sshd(8): Expose $SSH_CONNECTION in the PAM environment. This makes
    the connection 4-tuple available to PAM modules that wish to use
    it in decision-making.
  * sshd(8): Add a ssh_config "Match final" predicate Matches in same
    pass as "Match canonical" but doesn't require hostname
    canonicalisation be enabled.
  * sftp(1): Support a prefix of '@' to suppress echo of sftp batch
    commands.
  * ssh-keygen(1): When printing certificate contents using
    "ssh-keygen -Lf /path/certificate", include the algorithm that
    the CA used to sign the cert.

- Remove the "KexDHMin" config keyword (bsc#1127180)
  It used to allow lowering of the minimal allowed DH group size,
  which was increased to 2048 by upstream in the light of the Logjam
  attack.
  The code was broken since the upgrade to 7.6p1, but nobody noticed.
  As apparently no one needs the functionality any more, let's drop
  the patch.
  It's still possible to use the fixed 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
  key exchange method when working with legacy systems.

    authorities.
  * sshd(8): the authentication success/failure log message has
    changed format slightly. It now includes the certificate
    fingerprint (previously it included only key ID and CA key
    fingerprint).
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): allow most port numbers to be specified using
    service names from getservbyname(3) (typically /etc/services).
  * sshd(8): support signalling sessions via the SSH protocol.
    A limited subset of signals is supported and only for login or
    command sessions (i.e. not subsystems) that were not subject to
    a forced command via authorized_keys or sshd_config. bz#1424
  * ssh(1): support "ssh -Q sig" to list supported signature options.
    Also "ssh -Q help" to show the full set of supported queries.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): add a CASignatureAlgorithms option for the
    client and server configs to allow control over which signature
    formats are allowed for CAs to sign certificates. For example,
    this allows banning CAs that sign certificates using the RSA-SHA1
    signature algorithm.
  * sshd(8), ssh-keygen(1): allow key revocation lists (KRLs) to
    revoke keys specified by SHA256 hash.
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow creation of key revocation lists directly
    from base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprints. This supports revoking
    keys using only the information contained in sshd(8)
    authentication log messages.

Mon May 21 15:19:03 UTC 2018 - pcerny@suse.com

- Upgrade to 7.7p1 (bsc#1094068)
  Most important changes (more details below):
  * Drop compatibility support for pre-2001 SSH implementations
  * sshd(1) does not load DSA keys by default
  Distilled upstream log:
  ---- Potentially-incompatible changes
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Drop compatibility support for some very old
    SSH implementations, including ssh.com <=2.* and OpenSSH <=
    3.*.  These versions were all released in or before 2001 and
    predate the final SSH RFCs. The support in question isn't
    necessary for RFC-compliant SSH implementations.
  ---- New Features
  * experimental support for PQC XMSS keys (Extended Hash-Based
    Signatures), not compiled in by default.
  * sshd(8): Add a "rdomain" criteria for the sshd_config Match
    keyword to allow conditional configuration that depends on
    which routing domain a connection was received on (currently
    supported on OpenBSD and Linux).
  * sshd_config(5): Add an optional rdomain qualifier to the
    ListenAddress directive to allow listening on different
    routing domains. This is supported only on OpenBSD and Linux
    at present.
  * sshd_config(5): Add RDomain directive to allow the
    authenticated session to be placed in an explicit routing
    domain. This is only supported on OpenBSD at present.
  * sshd(8): Add "expiry-time" option for authorized_keys files
    to allow for expiring keys.
  * ssh(1): Add a BindInterface option to allow binding the
    outgoing connection to an interface's address (basically a
    more usable BindAddress)
  * ssh(1): Expose device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a
    new %T expansion for LocalCommand. This allows LocalCommand
    to be %used to prepare the interface.
  * sshd(8): Expose the device allocated for tun/tap forwarding
    via a new SSH_TUNNEL environment variable. This allows
    automatic setup of the interface and surrounding network
    configuration automatically on the server.
  * ssh(1)/scp(1)/sftp(1): Add URI support to ssh, sftp and scp,
    e.g.  ssh://user@host or sftp://user@host/path.  Additional
    connection parameters that use deporecated MD5 are not
    implemented.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Allow certificate validity intervals that
    specify only a start or stop time (instead of both or
    neither).
  * sftp(1): Allow "cd" and "lcd" commands with no explicit path
    argument. lcd will change to the local user's home directory
    as usual. cd will change to the starting directory for
    session (because the protocol offers no way to obtain the
    remote user's home directory). bz#2760
  * sshd(8): When doing a config test with sshd -T, only require
    the attributes that are actually used in Match criteria
    rather than (an incomplete list of) all criteria.
  ---- Bugfixes
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): More strictly check signature types during
    key exchange against what was negotiated. Prevents downgrade
    of RSA signatures made with SHA-256/512 to SHA-1.
  * sshd(8): Fix support for client that advertise a protocol
    version of "1.99" (indicating that they are prepared to
    accept both SSHv1 and SSHv2). This was broken in OpenSSH 7.6
    during the removal of SSHv1 support. bz#2810
  * ssh(1): Warn when the agent returns a ssh-rsa (SHA1)
    signature when a rsa-sha2-256/512 signature was requested.
    This condition is possible when an old or non-OpenSSH agent
    is in use. bz#2799
  * ssh-agent(1): Fix regression introduced in 7.6 that caused
    ssh-agent to fatally exit if presented an invalid signature
    request message.
  * sshd_config(5): Accept yes/no flag options
    case-insensitively, as has been the case in ssh_config(5) for
    a long time. bz#2664
  * ssh(1): Improve error reporting for failures during
    connection.  Under some circumstances misleading errors were
    being shown. bz#2814
  * ssh-keyscan(1): Add -D option to allow printing of results
    directly in SSHFP format. bz#2821
  * regress tests: fix PuTTY interop test broken in last
    release's SSHv1 removal. bz#2823
  * ssh(1): Compatibility fix for some servers that erroneously
    drop the connection when the IUTF8 (RFC8160) option is sent.
  * scp(1): Disable RemoteCommand and RequestTTY in the ssh
    session started by scp (sftp was already doing this.)
  * ssh-keygen(1): Refuse to create a certificate with an
    unusable number of principals.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Fatally exit if ssh-keygen is unable to write
    all the public key during key generation. Previously it would
    silently ignore errors writing the comment and terminating
    newline.
  * ssh(1): Do not modify hostname arguments that are addresses
    by automatically forcing them to lower-case. Instead
    canonicalise them to resolve ambiguities (e.g. ::0001 => ::1)
    before they are matched against known_hosts. bz#2763
  * ssh(1): Don't accept junk after "yes" or "no" responses to
    hostkey prompts. bz#2803
  * sftp(1): Have sftp print a warning about shell cleanliness
    when decoding the first packet fails, which is usually caused
    by shells polluting stdout of non-interactive startups.
    bz#2800
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Switch timers in packet code from using
    wall-clock time to monotonic time, allowing the packet layer
    to better function over a clock step and avoiding possible
    integer overflows during steps.
  * Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.

- Update to vanilla 7.6p1
  Most important changes (more details below):
  * complete removal of the ancient SSHv1 protocol
  * sshd(8) cannot run without privilege separation
  * removal of suport for arcfourm blowfish and CAST ciphers
    and RIPE-MD160 HMAC
  * refuse RSA keys shorter than 1024 bits
  Distilled upstream log:
- OpenSSH 7.3
  ---- Security
  * sshd(8): Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack
    against the system's crypt(3) function via sshd(8). An
    attacker could send very long passwords that would cause
    excessive CPU use in crypt(3). sshd(8) now refuses to accept
    password authentication requests of length greater than 1024
    characters. Independently reported by Tomas Kuthan (Oracle),
    Andres Rojas and Javier Nieto.
  * sshd(8): Mitigate timing differences in password
    authentication that could be used to discern valid from
    invalid account names when long passwords were sent and
    particular password hashing algorithms are in use on the
    server. CVE-2016-6210, reported by EddieEzra.Harari at
    verint.com
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC
    padding oracle countermeasures. Reported by Jean Paul
    Degabriele, Kenny Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin
    Albrecht. Note that CBC ciphers are disabled by default and
    only included for legacy compatibility.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Improve operation ordering of MAC
    verification for Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC
    algorithms to verify the MAC before decrypting any
    ciphertext. This removes the possibility of timing
    differences leaking facts about the plaintext, though no such
    leakage has been observed.  Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele,
    Kenny Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht.
  * sshd(8): (portable only) Ignore PAM environment vars when
    UseLogin=yes. If PAM is configured to read user-specified
    environment variables and UseLogin=yes in sshd_config, then a
    hostile local user may attack /bin/login via LD_PRELOAD or
    similar environment variables set via PAM. CVE-2015-8325,
    found by Shayan Sadigh.
  ---- New Features
  * ssh(1): Add a ProxyJump option and corresponding -J
    command-line flag to allow simplified indirection through a
    one or more SSH bastions or "jump hosts".
  * ssh(1): Add an IdentityAgent option to allow specifying
    specific agent sockets instead of accepting one from the
    environment.
  * ssh(1): Allow ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings to
    be optionally overridden when using ssh -W. bz#2577
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Implement support for the IUTF8 terminal
    mode as per draft-sgtatham-secsh-iutf8-00.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Add support for additional fixed
    Diffie-Hellman 2K, 4K and 8K groups from
    draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2-03.
  * ssh-keygen(1), ssh(1), sshd(8): support SHA256 and SHA512 RSA
    signatures in certificates;
  * ssh(1): Add an Include directive for ssh_config(5) files.
  * ssh(1): Permit UTF-8 characters in pre-authentication banners
    sent from the server. bz#2058
  ---- Bugfixes
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Reduce the syslog level of some relatively
    common protocol events from LOG_CRIT. bz#2585
  * sshd(8): Refuse AuthenticationMethods="" in configurations
    and accept AuthenticationMethods=any for the default
    behaviour of not requiring multiple authentication. bz#2398
  * sshd(8): Remove obsolete and misleading "POSSIBLE BREAK-IN
    ATTEMPT!" message when forward and reverse DNS don't match.
    bz#2585
  * ssh(1): Close ControlPersist background process stderr except
    in debug mode or when logging to syslog. bz#1988
  * misc: Make PROTOCOL description for
    direct-streamlocal@openssh.com channel open messages match
    deployed code. bz#2529
  * ssh(1): Deduplicate LocalForward and RemoteForward entries to
    fix failures when both ExitOnForwardFailure and hostname
    canonicalisation are enabled. bz#2562
  * sshd(8): Remove fallback from moduli to obsolete "primes"
    file that was deprecated in 2001. bz#2559.
  * sshd_config(5): Correct description of UseDNS: it affects ssh
    hostname processing for authorized_keys, not known_hosts;
    bz#2554
  * ssh(1): Fix authentication using lone certificate keys in an
    agent without corresponding private keys on the filesystem.
    bz#2550
  * sshd(8): Send ClientAliveInterval pings when a time-based
    RekeyLimit is set; previously keepalive packets were not
    being sent. bz#2252
  ---- Portability
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix compilation by automatically disabling
    ciphers not supported by OpenSSL. bz#2466
  * misc: Fix compilation failures on some versions of AIX's
    compiler related to the definition of the VA_COPY macro.
    bz#2589
  * sshd(8): Whitelist more architectures to enable the
    seccomp-bpf sandbox. bz#2590
  * ssh-agent(1), sftp-server(8): Disable process tracing on
    Solaris using setpflags(__PROC_PROTECT, ...). bz#2584
  * sshd(8): On Solaris, don't call Solaris setproject() with
    UsePAM=yes it's PAM's responsibility. bz#2425
- OpenSSH 7.4
  ---- Potentially-incompatible changes
  * ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal.
    64-bit block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want
    to wait until attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As
    3des-cbc was the only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this
    may cause problems connecting to older devices using the
    default configuration, but it's highly likely that such
    devices already need explicit configuration for key exchange
    and hostkey algorithms already anyway.
  * sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
    Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed
    reasonable in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in
    terms of both cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle
    attacks in TLS) and attack surface. Pre-auth compression
    support has been disabled by default for >10 years. Support
    remains in the client.
  * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a
    whitelist of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may
    be specified at run-time.
  * sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate
    and an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd
    will now refuse to accept the certificate unless they are
    identical.  The previous (documented) behaviour of having the
    certificate forced-command override the other could be a bit
    confusing and error-prone.
  * sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and
    support for having /bin/login manage login sessions.
  ---- Security
  * ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from
    paths outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable).
    Requests to load modules could be passed via agent forwarding
    and an attacker could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11
    module across the forwarded agent channel: PKCS#11 modules
    are shared libraries, so this would result in code execution
    on the system running the ssh-agent if the attacker has
    control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host running
    the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
    of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the
    ssh client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
  * sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded
    Unix- domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the
    privileges of 'root' instead of the authenticated user. This
    release refuses Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege
    separation is disabled (Privilege separation has been enabled
    by default for 14 years).  Reported by Jann Horn of Project
    Zero.
  * sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material
    to privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when
    reading keys. No such leak was observed in practice for
    normal-sized keys, nor does a leak to the child processes
    directly expose key material to unprivileged users. Reported
    by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
  * sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
    compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided
    by some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory
    manager was incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication
    compression was disabled. This could potentially allow
    attacks against the privileged monitor process from the
    sandboxed privilege-separation process (a compromise of the
    latter would be required first).  This release removes
    support for pre-authentication compression from sshd(8).
    Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
    optimisation identification tool
    (http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/)
  * sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker
    who sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB
    per connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.
  * sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
    directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept
    invalid ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid
    CIDR address ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would
    always match, possibly resulting in granting access where it
    was not intended.  Reported by Laurence Parry.
  ---- New Features
  * ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by
    the version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a
    multiplexing client to communicate with the master process
    using a subset of the SSH packet and channels protocol over a
    Unix-domain socket, with the main process acting as a proxy
    that translates channel IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing
    mode to run on systems that lack file- descriptor passing
    (used by current multiplexing code) and potentially, in
    conjunction with Unix-domain socket forwarding, with the
    client and multiplexing master process on different machines.
    Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using "ssh -O proxy
    ..."
  * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config DisableForwarding option that
    disables X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket
    forwarding, as well as anything else we might implement in
    the future. Like the 'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is
    intended to be a simple and future-proof way of restricting
    an account.
  * sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
    method. This is identical to the currently-supported method
    named "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".
  * sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if
    sshd is already daemonised at startup and skipping the call
    to daemon(3) if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of
    sshd(8) will retain the same process-ID as the initial
    execution. sshd(8) will also now unlink the PidFile prior to
    SIGHUP restart and re-create it after a successful restart,
    rather than leaving a stale file in the case of a
    configuration error. bz#2641
  * sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
    directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.
  * sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to
    match those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key
    type, fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to
    the contents of the certificate being offered.
  * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching
    and string sanitisation functions.
  * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.
  ---- Bugfixes
  * ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
    certificates that have no corresponding bare public key.
    bz#2617 certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).
  * ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
    authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
    method attempted. bz#2642
  * regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended.
    bz#2639
  * ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to
    load keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages
    and more detail in debug messages. bz#2610
  * ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
    pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.
  * sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
    suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the
    terminal mode correctly if suspended during a password
    prompt.
  * ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a
    password prompt.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of
    ext- info messages.
  * sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
    sequence NEWKEYS message.
  * sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent
    in the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547
  * sshd(8): Fix sending ext_info message if privsep is disabled.
  * sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of
    privilege separation monitor calls used for authentication
    and allow them only when their respective authentication
    methods are enabled in the configuration
  * sshd(8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call;
    harmless on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.
  * Fix false positive reports caused by explicit_bzero(3) not
    being recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
    -fsanitize-memory.
  * sshd_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet
    for configuration examples.
  ---- Portability
  * On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to
    the C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing
    caused by that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i'
    and 'I'. bz#2643
  * sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
    ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, ..)
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8)
    OpenSSL.
  * Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160
    support.
  * contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640
  * sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation
    and force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before
    chroot or sandboxing.
  * All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an
    strnvis and unfortunately made it incompatible with the
    existing one in OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having
    existed for over ten years). Try to detect this mess, and
    assume the only safe option if we're cross compiling.
- OpenSSH 7.5
  ---- Potentially-incompatible changes
  * This release deprecates the sshd_config
    UsePrivilegeSeparation option, thereby making privilege
    separation mandatory. Privilege separation has been on by
    default for almost 15 years and sandboxing has been on by
    default for almost the last five.
  * The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code
    has changed to include additional information about the user
    and their authentication state. Software that monitors
    ssh/sshd logs may need to account for these changes. For
    example:
   Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
   Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234
   [preauth] Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port
   1234 [preauth]
   Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
   disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal
   messages generated by the packet code.
  * [Portable OpenSSH only] This version removes support for
    building against OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1. OpenSSL
    stopped supporting versions prior to 1.0.1 over 12 months ago
    (i.e. they no longer receive fixes for security bugs).
  ---- Security
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix weakness in CBC padding oracle
    countermeasures that allowed a variant of the attack fixed in
    OpenSSH 7.3 to proceed.  Note that the OpenSSH client
    disables CBC ciphers by default, sshd offers them as
    lowest-preference options and will remove them by default
    entriely in the next release. Reported by Jean Paul
    Degabriele, Kenny Paterson, Martin Albrecht and Torben Hansen
    of Royal Holloway, University of London.
  * sftp-client(1): [portable OpenSSH only] On Cygwin, a client
    making a recursive file transfer could be maniuplated by a
    hostile server to perform a path-traversal attack. creating
    or modifying files outside of the intended target directory.
    Reported by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.
  ---- New Features
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Support "=-" syntax to easily remove methods
    from algorithm lists, e.g. Ciphers=-*cbc. bz#2671
  ---- Bugfixes
  * sshd(1): Fix NULL dereference crash when key exchange start
    messages are sent out of sequence.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Allow form-feed characters to appear in
    configuration files.
  * sshd(8): Fix regression in OpenSSH 7.4 support for the
    server-sig-algs extension, where SHA2 RSA signature methods
    were not being correctly advertised. bz#2680
  * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Fix a number of case-sensitivity bugs
    in known_hosts processing. bz#2591 bz#2685
  * ssh(1): Allow ssh to use certificates accompanied by a
    private key file but no corresponding plain *.pub public key.
    bz#2617
  * ssh(1): When updating hostkeys using the UpdateHostKeys
    option, accept RSA keys if HostkeyAlgorithms contains any RSA
    keytype.  Previously, ssh could ignore RSA keys when only the
    ssh-rsa-sha2-* methods were enabled in HostkeyAlgorithms and
    not the old ssh-rsa method. bz#2650
  * ssh(1): Detect and report excessively long configuration file
    lines. bz#2651
  * Merge a number of fixes found by Coverity and reported via
    Redhat and FreeBSD. Includes fixes for some memory and file
    descriptor leaks in error paths. bz#2687
  * ssh-keyscan(1): Correctly hash hosts with a port number.
    bz#2692
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): When logging long messages to stderr, don't
    truncate "\r\n" if the length of the message exceeds the
    buffer. bz#2688
  * ssh(1): Fully quote [host]:port in generated ProxyJump/-J
    command- line; avoid confusion over IPv6 addresses and shells
    that treat square bracket characters specially.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Fix corruption of known_hosts when running
    "ssh-keygen -H" on a known_hosts containing already-hashed
    entries.
  * Fix various fallout and sharp edges caused by removing SSH
    protocol 1 support from the server, including the server
    banner string being incorrectly terminated with only \n
    (instead of \r\n), confusing error messages from ssh-keyscan
    bz#2583 and a segfault in sshd if protocol v.1 was enabled
    for the client and sshd_config contained references to legacy
    keys bz#2686.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Free fd_set on connection timeout. bz#2683
  * sshd(8): Fix Unix domain socket forwarding for root
    (regression in OpenSSH 7.4).
  * sftp(1): Fix division by zero crash in "df" output when
    server returns zero total filesystem blocks/inodes.
  * ssh(1), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1), sshd(8): Translate OpenSSL
    errors encountered during key loading to more meaningful
    error codes.  bz#2522 bz#2523
  * ssh-keygen(1): Sanitise escape sequences in key comments sent
    to printf but preserve valid UTF-8 when the locale supports
    it; bz#2520
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Return reason for port forwarding failures
    where feasible rather than always "administratively
    prohibited". bz#2674
  * sshd(8): Fix deadlock when AuthorizedKeysCommand or
    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand produces a lot of output and a
    key is matched early. bz#2655
  * Regression tests: several reliability fixes. bz#2654 bz#2658
    bz#2659
  * ssh(1): Fix typo in ~C error message for bad port forward
    cancellation. bz#2672
  * ssh(1): Show a useful error message when included config
    files can't be opened; bz#2653
  * sshd(8): Make sshd set GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck=yes as the
    manual page (previously incorrectly) advertised. bz#2637
  * sshd_config(5): Repair accidentally-deleted mention of %k
    token in AuthorizedKeysCommand; bz#2656
  * sshd(8): Remove vestiges of previously removed LOGIN_PROGRAM;
    bz#2665
  * ssh-agent(1): Relax PKCS#11 whitelist to include libexec and
    common 32-bit compatibility library directories.
  * sftp-client(1): Fix non-exploitable integer overflow in
    SSH2_FXP_NAME response handling.
  * ssh-agent(1): Fix regression in 7.4 of deleting
    PKCS#11-hosted keys. It was not possible to delete them
    except by specifying their full physical path. bz#2682
  ---- Portability
  * sshd(8): Avoid sandbox errors for Linux S390 systems using an
    ICA crypto coprocessor.
  * sshd(8): Fix non-exploitable weakness in seccomp-bpf sandbox
    arg inspection.
  * ssh(1): Fix X11 forwarding on OSX where X11 was being started
    by launchd. bz#2341
  * ssh-keygen(1), ssh(1), sftp(1): Fix output truncation for
    various that contain non-printable characters where the
    codeset in use is ASCII.
  * build: Fix builds that attempt to link a kerberised libldns.
    bz#2603
  * build: Fix compilation problems caused by unconditionally
    defining _XOPEN_SOURCE in wide character detection.
  * sshd(8): Fix sandbox violations for clock_gettime VSDO
    syscall fallback on some Linux/X32 kernels. bz#2142
- OpenSSH 7.6
  ---- Potentially-incompatible changes
  This release includes a number of changes that may affect
  existing configurations:
  * ssh(1): delete SSH protocol version 1 support, associated
    configuration options and documentation.
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): remove support for the hmac-ripemd160 MAC.
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): remove support for the arcfour, blowfish and
    CAST ciphers.
  * Refuse RSA keys <1024 bits in length and improve reporting
    for keys that do not meet this requirement.
  * ssh(1): do not offer CBC ciphers by default.
  ---- Security
  * sftp-server(8): in read-only mode, sftp-server was
    incorrectly permitting creation of zero-length files.
    Reported by Michal Zalewski.
  ---- New Features
  * ssh(1): add RemoteCommand option to specify a command in the
    ssh config file instead of giving it on the client's command
    line. This allows the configuration file to specify the
    command that will be executed on the remote host.
  * sshd(8): add ExposeAuthInfo option that enables writing
    details of the authentication methods used (including public
    keys where applicable) to a file that is exposed via a
    $SSH_USER_AUTH environment variable in the subsequent
    session.
  * ssh(1): add support for reverse dynamic forwarding. In this
    mode, ssh will act as a SOCKS4/5 proxy and forward
    connections to destinations requested by the remote SOCKS
    client. This mode is requested using extended syntax for the
    -R and RemoteForward options and, because it is implemented
    solely at the client, does not require the server be updated
    to be supported.
  * sshd(8): allow LogLevel directive in sshd_config Match
    blocks; bz#2717
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow inclusion of arbitrary string or flag
    certificate extensions and critical options.
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow ssh-keygen to use a key held in
    ssh-agent as a CA when signing certificates. bz#2377
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): allow IPQoS=none in ssh/sshd to not set an
    explicit ToS/DSCP value and just use the operating system
    default.
  * ssh-add(1): added -q option to make ssh-add quiet on success.
  * ssh(1): expand the StrictHostKeyChecking option with two new
    settings. The first "accept-new" will automatically accept
    hitherto-unseen keys but will refuse connections for changed
    or invalid hostkeys. This is a safer subset of the current
    behaviour of StrictHostKeyChecking=no. The second setting
    "off", is a synonym for the current behaviour of
    StrictHostKeyChecking=no: accept new host keys, and continue
    connection for hosts with incorrect hostkeys. A future
    release will change the meaning of StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    to the behaviour of "accept-new". bz#2400
  * ssh(1): add SyslogFacility option to ssh(1) matching the
    equivalent option in sshd(8). bz#2705
  ---- Bugfixes
  * ssh(1): use HostKeyAlias if specified instead of hostname for
    matching host certificate principal names; bz#2728
  * sftp(1): implement sorting for globbed ls; bz#2649
  * ssh(1): add a user@host prefix to client's "Permission
    denied" messages, useful in particular when using "stacked"
    connections (e.g. ssh -J) where it's not clear which host is
    denying. bz#2720
  * ssh(1): accept unknown EXT_INFO extension values that contain
    \0 characters. These are legal, but would previously cause
    fatal connection errors if received.
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): repair compression statistics printed at
    connection exit
  * sftp(1): print '?' instead of incorrect link count (that the
    protocol doesn't provide) for remote listings. bz#2710
  * ssh(1): return failure rather than fatal() for more cases
    during session multiplexing negotiations. Causes the session
    to fall back to a non-mux connection if they occur. bz#2707
  * ssh(1): mention that the server may send debug messages to
    explain public key authentication problems under some
    circumstances; bz#2709
  * Translate OpenSSL error codes to better report incorrect
    passphrase errors when loading private keys; bz#2699
  * sshd(8): adjust compatibility patterns for WinSCP to
    correctly identify versions that implement only the legacy DH
    group exchange scheme. bz#2748
  * ssh(1): print the "Killed by signal 1" message only at
    LogLevel verbose so that it is not shown at the default
    level; prevents it from appearing during ssh -J and
    equivalent ProxyCommand configs.  bz#1906, bz#2744
  * ssh-keygen(1): when generating all hostkeys (ssh-keygen -A),
    clobber existing keys if they exist but are zero length.
    zero-length keys could previously be made if ssh-keygen
    failed or was interrupted part way through generating them.
    bz#2561
  * ssh(1): fix pledge(2) violation in the escape sequence "~&"
    used to place the current session in the background.
  * ssh-keyscan(1): avoid double-close() on file descriptors;
    bz#2734
  * sshd(8): avoid reliance on shared use of pointers shared
    between monitor and child sshd processes. bz#2704
  * sshd_config(8): document available AuthenticationMethods;
    bz#2453
  * ssh(1): avoid truncation in some login prompts; bz#2768
  * sshd(8): Fix various compilations failures, inc bz#2767
  * ssh(1): make "--" before the hostname terminate argument
    processing after the hostname too.
  * ssh-keygen(1): switch from aes256-cbc to aes256-ctr for
    encrypting new-style private keys. Fixes problems related to
    private key handling for no-OpenSSL builds. bz#2754
  * ssh(1): warn and do not attempt to use keys when the public
    and private halves do not match. bz#2737
  * sftp(1): don't print verbose error message when ssh
    disconnects from under sftp. bz#2750
  * sshd(8): fix keepalive scheduling problem: activity on a
    forwarded port from preventing the keepalive from being sent;
    bz#2756
  * sshd(8): when started without root privileges, don't require
    the privilege separation user or path to exist. Makes running
    the regression tests easier without touching the filesystem.
  * Make integrity.sh regression tests more robust against
    timeouts.  bz#2658
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): correctness fix for channels implementation:
    accept channel IDs greater than 0x7FFFFFFF.
  ---- Portability
  * sshd(9): drop two more privileges in the Solaris sandbox:
    PRIV_DAX_ACCESS and PRIV_SYS_IB_INFO; bz#2723
  * sshd(8): expose list of completed authentication methods to
    PAM via the SSH_AUTH_INFO_0 PAM environment variable. bz#2408
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): fix several problems in the tun/tap
    forwarding code, mostly to do with host/network byte order
    confusion. bz#2735
  * Add --with-cflags-after and --with-ldflags-after configure
    flags to allow setting CFLAGS/LDFLAGS after configure has
    completed. These are useful for setting sanitiser/fuzzing
    options that may interfere with configure's operation.
  * sshd(8): avoid Linux seccomp violations on ppc64le over the
    socketcall syscall.
  * Fix use of ldns when using ldns-config; bz#2697
  * configure: set cache variables when cross-compiling. The
    cross- compiling fallback message was saying it assumed the
    test passed, but it wasn't actually set the cache variables
    and this would cause later tests to fail.
  * Add clang libFuzzer harnesses for public key parsing and
    signature verification.

Fri May 27 23:27:51 UTC 2016 - pcerny@suse.com

- upgrade to 7.2p2
  upstream package without any SUSE patches
  Distilled upstream log:
- OpenSSH 6.7
  Potentially-incompatible changes:
  * sshd(8): The default set of ciphers and MACs has been
    altered to remove unsafe algorithms. In particular, CBC
    ciphers and arcfour* are disabled by default.
    The full set of algorithms remains available if configured
    explicitly via the Ciphers and MACs sshd_config options.
  * sshd(8): Support for tcpwrappers/libwrap has been removed.
  * OpenSSH 6.5 and 6.6 have a bug that causes ~0.2% of
    connections using the curve25519-sha256@libssh.org KEX
    exchange method to fail when connecting with something that
    implements the specification correctly. OpenSSH 6.7 disables
    this KEX method when speaking to one of the affected
    versions.
  New Features:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Add support for Unix domain socket
    forwarding. A remote TCP port may be forwarded to a local
    Unix domain socket and vice versa or both ends may be a Unix
    domain socket.
  * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Add support for SSHFP DNS records for
    ED25519 key types.
  * sftp(1): Allow resumption of interrupted uploads.
  * ssh(1): When rekeying, skip file/DNS lookups of the hostkey
    if it is the same as the one sent during initial key exchange
  * sshd(8): Allow explicit ::1 and 127.0.0.1 forwarding bind
    addresses when GatewayPorts=no; allows client to choose
    address family
  * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config PermitUserRC option to control
    whether ~/.ssh/rc is executed, mirroring the no-user-rc
    authorized_keys option
  * ssh(1): Add a %C escape sequence for LocalCommand and
    ControlPath that expands to a unique identifer based on a
    hash of the tuple of (local host, remote user, hostname,
    port). Helps avoid exceeding miserly pathname limits for Unix
    domain sockets in multiplexing control paths
  * sshd(8): Make the "Too many authentication failures" message
    include the user, source address, port and protocol in a
    format similar to the authentication success / failure
    messages
  Bugfixes:
  * sshd(8): Fix remote forwarding with the same listen port but
    different listen address.
  * ssh(1): Fix inverted test that caused PKCS#11 keys that were
    explicitly listed in ssh_config or on the commandline not to
    be preferred.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Fix bug in KRL generation: multiple
    consecutive revoked certificate serial number ranges could be
    serialised to an invalid format. Readers of a broken KRL
    caused by this bug will fail closed, so no
    should-have-been-revoked key will be accepted.
  * ssh(1): Reflect stdio-forward ("ssh -W host:port ...")
    failures in exit status. Previously we were always returning 0
  * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Make Ed25519 keys' title fit properly
    in the randomart border
  * ssh-agent(1): Only cleanup agent socket in the main agent
    process and not in any subprocesses it may have started (e.g.
    forked askpass). Fixes agent sockets being zapped when
    askpass processes fatal()
  * ssh-add(1): Make stdout line-buffered; saves partial output
    getting lost when ssh-add fatal()s part-way through (e.g.
    when listing keys from an agent that supports key types that
    ssh-add doesn't)
  * ssh-keygen(1): When hashing or removing hosts, don't choke on
    @revoked markers and don't remove @cert-authority markers
  * ssh(1): Don't fatal when hostname canonicalisation fails and
    a ProxyCommand is in use; continue and allow the ProxyCommand
    to connect anyway (e.g. to a host with a name outside the DNS
    behind a bastion)
  * scp(1): When copying local->remote fails during read, don't
    send uninitialised heap to the remote end.
  * sftp(1): Fix fatal "el_insertstr failed" errors when
    tab-completing filenames with  a single quote char somewhere
    in the string
  * ssh-keyscan(1): Scan for Ed25519 keys by default.
  * ssh(1): When using VerifyHostKeyDNS with a DNSSEC resolver,
    down-convert any certificate keys to plain keys and attempt
    SSHFP resolution.  Prevents a server from skipping SSHFP
    lookup and forcing a new-hostkey dialog by offering only
    certificate keys.
- OpenSSH 6.8
  Potentially-incompatible changes:
  * sshd(8): UseDNS now defaults to 'no'. Configurations that
    match against the client host name (via sshd_config or
    authorized_keys) may need to re-enable it or convert to
    matching against addresses.
  New Features:
  * Add FingerprintHash option to ssh(1) and sshd(8), and
    equivalent command-line flags to the other tools to control
    algorithm used for key fingerprints. The default changes from
    MD5 to SHA256 and format from hex to base64.
    Fingerprints now have the hash algorithm prepended. An
    example of the new format:
    SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE Please
    note that visual host keys will also be different.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): Experimental host key rotation support. Add
    a protocol extension for a server to inform a client of all
    its available host keys after authentication has completed.
    The client may record the keys in known_hosts, allowing it to
    upgrade to better host key algorithms and a server to
    gracefully rotate its keys.
    The client side of this is controlled by a UpdateHostkeys
    config option (default off).
  * ssh(1): Add a ssh_config HostbasedKeyType option to control
    which host public key types are tried during host-based
    authentication.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix connection-killing host key mismatch
    errors when sshd offers multiple ECDSA keys of different
    lengths.
  * ssh(1): when host name canonicalisation is enabled, try to
    parse host names as addresses before looking them up for
    canonicalisation. fixes bz#2074 and avoiding needless DNS
    lookups in some cases.
  * ssh-keygen(1), sshd(8): Key Revocation Lists (KRLs) no longer
    require OpenSSH to be compiled with OpenSSL support.
  * ssh(1), ssh-keysign(8): Make ed25519 keys work for host based
    authentication.
  * sshd(8): SSH protocol v.1 workaround for the Meyer, et al,
    Bleichenbacher Side Channel Attack. Fake up a bignum key
    before RSA decryption.
  * sshd(8): Remember which public keys have been used for
    authentication and refuse to accept previously-used keys.
    This allows AuthenticationMethods=publickey,publickey to
    require that users authenticate using two _different_ public
    keys.
  * sshd(8): add sshd_config HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes and
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes options to allow sshd to control what
    public key types will be accepted. Currently defaults to all.
  * sshd(8): Don't count partial authentication success as a
    failure against MaxAuthTries.
  * ssh(1): Add RevokedHostKeys option for the client to allow
    text-file or KRL-based revocation of host keys.
  * ssh-keygen(1), sshd(8): Permit KRLs that revoke certificates
    by serial number or key ID without scoping to a particular
    CA.
  * ssh(1): Add a "Match canonical" criteria that allows
    ssh_config Match blocks to trigger only in the second config
    pass.
  * ssh(1): Add a -G option to ssh that causes it to parse its
    configuration and dump the result to stdout, similar to
    "sshd -T".
  * ssh(1): Allow Match criteria to be negated.
    E.g. "Match !host".
  * The regression test suite has been extended to cover more
    OpenSSH features. The unit tests have been expanded and now
    cover key exchange.
  Bugfixes:
  * ssh-keyscan(1): ssh-keyscan has been made much more robust
    again servers that hang or violate the SSH protocol.
  * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): Fix regression: Key path names were
    being lost as comment fields.
  * ssh(1): Allow ssh_config Port options set in the second
    config parse phase to be applied (they were being ignored).
  * ssh(1): Tweak config re-parsing with host canonicalisation - make
    the second pass through the config files always run when host name
    canonicalisation is enabled (and not whenever the host name
    changes)
  * ssh(1): Fix passing of wildcard forward bind addresses when
    connection multiplexing is in use
  * ssh-keygen(1): Fix broken private key conversion from
    non-OpenSSH formats.
  * ssh-keygen(1): Fix KRL generation bug when multiple CAs are
    in use.
  * Various fixes to manual pages
- OpenSSH 6.9
  Security:
  * ssh(1): when forwarding X11 connections with
    ForwardX11Trusted=no, connections made after
    ForwardX11Timeout expired could be permitted and no longer
    subject to XSECURITY restrictions because of an ineffective
    timeout check in ssh(1) coupled with "fail open" behaviour in
    the X11 server when clients attempted connections with
    expired credentials. This problem was reported by Jann Horn.
  * ssh-agent(1): fix weakness of agent locking (ssh-add -x) to
    password guessing by implementing an increasing failure
    delay, storing a salted hash of the password rather than the
    password itself and using a timing-safe comparison function
    for verifying unlock attempts. This problem was reported by
    Ryan Castellucci.
  New Features:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): promote chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com to be
    the default cipher
  * sshd(8): support admin-specified arguments to
    AuthorizedKeysCommand
  * sshd(8): add AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand that allows
    retrieving authorized principals information from a
    subprocess rather than a file.
  * ssh(1), ssh-add(1): support PKCS#11 devices with external PIN
    entry devices
  * sshd(8): allow GSSAPI host credential check to be relaxed for
    multihomed hosts via GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck option
  * ssh-keygen(1): support "ssh-keygen -lF hostname" to search
    known_hosts and print key hashes rather than full keys.
  * ssh-agent(1): add -D flag to leave ssh-agent in foreground
    without enabling debug mode
  Bugfixes:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): deprecate legacy
    SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST_OLD message and do not try to use
    it against some 3rd-party SSH implementations that use it
    (older PuTTY, WinSCP).
  * Many fixes for problems caused by compile-time deactivation
    of SSH1 support (including bz#2369)
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): cap DH-GEX group size at 4Kbits for Cisco
    implementations as some would fail when attempting to use
    group sizes >4K
  * ssh(1): fix out-of-bound read in EscapeChar configuration
    option parsing
  * sshd(8): fix application of PermitTunnel, LoginGraceTime,
    AuthenticationMethods and StreamLocalBindMask options in
    Match blocks
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): improve disconnection message on TCP reset;
    bz#2257
  * ssh(1): remove failed remote forwards established by
    muliplexing from the list of active forwards
  * sshd(8): make parsing of authorized_keys "environment="
    options independent of PermitUserEnv being enabled
  * sshd(8): fix post-auth crash with permitopen=none
  * ssh(1), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): allow new-format private
    keys to be encrypted with AEAD ciphers
  * ssh(1): allow ListenAddress, Port and AddressFamily
    configuration options to appear in any order
  * sshd(8): check for and reject missing arguments for
    VersionAddendum and ForceCommand
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): don't treat unknown certificate extensions
    as fatal
  * ssh-keygen(1): make stdout and stderr output consistent
  * ssh(1): mention missing DISPLAY environment in debug log when
    X11 forwarding requested
  * sshd(8): correctly record login when UseLogin is set
  * sshd(8): Add some missing options to sshd -T output and fix
    output of VersionAddendum and HostCertificate. bz#2346
  * Document and improve consistency of options that accept a
    "none" argument" TrustedUserCAKeys, RevokedKeys (bz#2382),
    AuthorizedPrincipalsFile (bz#2288)
  * ssh(1): include remote username in debug output
  * sshd(8): avoid compatibility problem with some versions of
    Tera Term, which would crash when they received the hostkeys
    notification message (hostkeys-00@openssh.com)
  * sshd(8): mention ssh-keygen -E as useful when comparing
    legacy MD5 host key fingerprints
  * ssh(1): clarify pseudo-terminal request behaviour and use
    make manual language consistent
  * ssh(1): document that the TERM environment variable is not
    subject to SendEnv and AcceptEnv
- OpenSSH 7.0:
  This focuses primarily on deprecating weak, legacy and/or
  unsafe cryptography.
  Security:
  * sshd(8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be
    world- writable. Local attackers may be able to write
    arbitrary messages to logged-in users, including terminal
    escape sequences.  Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.
  * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
    weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could
    successfully compromise the pre-authentication process for
    remote code execution and who had valid credentials on the
    host could impersonate other users.  Reported by Moritz
    Jodeit.
  * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
    related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who
    could compromise the pre-authentication process for remote
    code execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.
  * sshd(8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
    interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
    keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could
    request the same authentication method be tried thousands of
    times in a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in sshd(8)
    and any authentication failure delays implemented by the
    authentication mechanism itself were still applied. Found by
    Kingcope.
  Potentially-incompatible Changes:
  * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
    default at compile time.
  * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key
    exchange is disabled by default at run-time. It may be
    re-enabled using the instructions in README.legacy or
    http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is
    disabled by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled
    using the instructions at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html
  * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.
  * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
    changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".
  * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans
    all interactive authentication methods, allowing only
    public-key, hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously
    it permitted keyboard-interactive and password-less
    authentication if those were enabled).
  New Features:
  * ssh_config(5): add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes option to control
    which public key types are available for user authentication.
  * sshd_config(5): add HostKeyAlgorithms option to control which
    public key types are offered for host authentications.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): extend Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgorithms,
    HostKeyAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and
    HostbasedKeyTypes options to allow appending to the default
    set of algorithms instead of replacing it. Options may now be
    prefixed with a '+' to append to the default, e.g.
    "HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss".
  * sshd_config(5): PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of
    'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-
    password'.
  Bugfixes:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): add compatability workarounds for Cisco and
    more PuTTY versions.
  * Fix some omissions and errors in the PROTOCOL and
    PROTOCOL.mux documentation relating to Unix domain socket
    forwarding
  * ssh(1): Improve the ssh(1) manual page to include a better
    description of Unix domain socket forwarding
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): skip uninitialised PKCS#11 slots,
    fixing failures to load keys when they are present.
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): do not ignore PKCS#11 hosted keys that
    wth empty CKA_ID
  * sshd(8): clarify documentation for UseDNS option
- OpenSSH 7.1:
  Security:
  * sshd(8): OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in
    PermitRootLogin= prohibit-password/without-password that
    could, depending on compile-time configuration, permit
    password authentication to root while preventing other forms
    of authentication. This problem was reported by Mantas
    Mikulenas.
  Bugfixes:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): add compatability workarounds for FuTTY
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): refine compatability workarounds for WinSCP
  * Fix a number of memory faults (double-free, free of
    uninitialised memory, etc) in ssh(1) and ssh-keygen(1).
    Reported by Mateusz Kocielski.
- OpenSSH 7.1p2:
  * SECURITY: ssh(1): The OpenSSH client code between 5.4 and 7.1
    contains experimential support for resuming SSH-connections
    (roaming).
    The matching server code has never been shipped, but the
    client code was enabled by default and could be tricked by a
    malicious server into leaking client memory to the server,
    including private client user keys.
    The authentication of the server host key prevents
    exploitation by a man-in-the-middle, so this information leak
    is restricted to connections to malicious or compromised
    servers.
    MITIGATION: For OpenSSH >= 5.4 the vulnerable code in the
    client can be completely disabled by adding 'UseRoaming no'
    to the gobal ssh_config(5) file, or to user configuration in
    ~/.ssh/config, or by passing -oUseRoaming=no on the command
    line.
    PATCH: See below for a patch to disable this feature
    (Disabling Roaming in the Source Code).
    This problem was reported by the Qualys Security Advisory
    team.
  * SECURITY: Eliminate the fallback from untrusted
    X11-forwarding to trusted forwarding for cases when the X
    server disables the SECURITY extension. Reported by Thomas
    Hoger.
  * SECURITY: Fix an out of-bound read access in the packet
    handling code. Reported by Ben Hawkes.
  * PROTOCOL: Correctly interpret the 'first_kex_follows' option
    during the intial key exchange. Reported by Matt Johnston.
  * Further use of explicit_bzero has been added in various
    buffer handling code paths to guard against compilers
    aggressively doing dead-store removal.
  Potentially-incompatible changes:
  * This release disables a number of legacy cryptographic
    algorithms by default in ssh:
    + Several ciphers blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, all arcfour
      variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.
    + MD5-based and truncated HMAC algorithms.
- OpenSSH 7.2:
  Security:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): remove unfinished and unused roaming code
    (was already forcibly disabled in OpenSSH 7.1p2).
  * ssh(1): eliminate fallback from untrusted X11 forwarding to
    trusted forwarding when the X server disables the SECURITY
    extension.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): increase the minimum modulus size supported
    for diffie-hellman-group-exchange to 2048 bits.
  * sshd(8): pre-auth sandboxing is now enabled by default
    (previous releases enabled it for new installations via
    sshd_config).
  New Features:
  * all: add support for RSA signatures using SHA-256/512 hash
    algorithms based on draft-rsa-dsa-sha2-256-03.txt and
    draft-ssh-ext-info-04.txt.
  * ssh(1): Add an AddKeysToAgent client option which can be set
    to 'yes', 'no', 'ask', or 'confirm', and defaults to 'no'.
    When enabled, a private key that is used during
    authentication will be added to ssh-agent if it is running
    (with confirmation enabled if set to 'confirm').
  * sshd(8): add a new authorized_keys option "restrict" that
    includes all current and future key restrictions
    (no-*-forwarding, etc.).  Also add permissive versions of the
    existing restrictions, e.g.  "no-pty" -> "pty". This
    simplifies the task of setting up restricted keys and ensures
    they are maximally-restricted, regardless of any permissions
    we might implement in the future.
  * ssh(1): add ssh_config CertificateFile option to explicitly
    list certificates. bz#2436
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow ssh-keygen to change the key comment for
    all supported formats.
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow fingerprinting from standard input, e.g.
    "ssh-keygen -lf -"
  * ssh-keygen(1): allow fingerprinting multiple public keys in a
    file, e.g. "ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" bz#1319
  * sshd(8): support "none" as an argument for sshd_config
    Foreground and ChrootDirectory. Useful inside Match blocks to
    override a global default. bz#2486
  * ssh-keygen(1): support multiple certificates (one per line)
    and reading from standard input (using "-f -") for
    "ssh-keygen -L"
  * ssh-keyscan(1): add "ssh-keyscan -c ..." flag to allow
    fetching certificates instead of plain keys.
  * ssh(1): better handle anchored FQDNs (e.g. 'cvs.openbsd.org')
    in hostname canonicalisation - treat them as already
    canonical and remove the trailing '.' before matching
    ssh_config.
  Bugfixes:
  * sftp(1): existing destination directories should not
    terminate recursive uploads (regression in openssh 6.8)
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): correctly send back SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED
    replies to unexpected messages during key exchange.
  * ssh(1): refuse attempts to set ConnectionAttempts=0, which
    does not make sense and would cause ssh to print an
    uninitialised stack variable.
  * ssh(1): fix errors when attempting to connect to scoped IPv6
    addresses with hostname canonicalisation enabled.
  * sshd_config(5): list a couple more options usable in Match
    blocks.
  * sshd(8): fix "PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +..." inside a Match
    block.
  * ssh(1): expand tilde characters in filenames passed to -i
    options before checking whether or not the identity file
    exists. Avoids confusion for cases where shell doesn't expand
    (e.g. "-i ~/file" vs. "-i~/file").
  * ssh(1): do not prepend "exec" to the shell command run by
    "Match exec" in a config file, which could cause some
    commands to fail in certain environments.
  * ssh-keyscan(1): fix output for multiple hosts/addrs on one
    line when host hashing or a non standard port is in use
  * sshd(8): skip "Could not chdir to home directory" message
    when ChrootDirectory is active.
  * ssh(1): include PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes in ssh -G config dump.
  * sshd(8): avoid changing TunnelForwarding device flags if they
    are already what is needed; makes it possible to use tun/tap
    networking as non-root user if device permissions and
    interface flags are pre-established
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): RekeyLimits could be exceeded by one packet.
  * ssh(1): fix multiplexing master failure to notice client
    exit.
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): avoid fatal() for PKCS11 tokens that
    present empty key IDs.
  * sshd(8): avoid printf of NULL argument.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): allow RekeyLimits larger than 4GB.
  * ssh-keygen(1): sshd(8): fix several bugs in (unused) KRL
    signature support.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix connections with peers that use the key
    exchange guess feature of the protocol.
  * sshd(8): include remote port number in log messages.
  * ssh(1): don't try to load SSHv1 private key when compiled
    without SSHv1 support.
  * ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): fix incorrect error messages during key
    loading and signing errors.
  * ssh-keygen(1): don't leave empty temporary files when
    performing known_hosts file edits when known_hosts doesn't
    exist.
  * sshd(8): correct packet format for tcpip-forward replies for
    requests that don't allocate a port
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix possible hang on closed output.
  * ssh(1): expand %i in ControlPath to UID.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix return type of openssh_RSA_verify.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix some option parsing memory leaks.
  * ssh(1): add a some debug output before DNS resolution; it's a
    place where ssh could previously silently stall in cases of
    unresponsive DNS servers.
  * ssh(1): remove spurious newline in visual hostkey.
  * ssh(1): fix printing (ssh -G ...) of HostKeyAlgorithms=+...
  * ssh(1): fix expansion of HostkeyAlgorithms=+...
  Documentation:
  * ssh_config(5), sshd_config(5): update default algorithm lists
    to match current reality.
  * ssh(1): mention -Q key-plain and -Q key-cert query options.
  * sshd_config(8): more clearly describe what
    AuthorizedKeysFile=none does.
  * ssh_config(5): better document ExitOnForwardFailure.
  * sshd(5): mention internal DH-GEX fallback groups in manual.
  * sshd_config(5): better description for MaxSessions option.
  Portability:
  * sshd(8): fix multiple authentication using S/Key.
- OpenSSH 7.2p2:
  Security:
  * sshd(8): sanitise X11 authentication credentials to avoid
    xauth command injection when X11Forwarding is enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 11 21:50:51 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- update to 6.6p1
  Security:
  * sshd(8): when using environment passing with a sshd_config(5)
    AcceptEnv pattern with a wildcard. OpenSSH prior to 6.6 could
    be tricked into accepting any enviornment variable that
    contains the characters before the wildcard character.
  Features since 6.5p1:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): removal of the J-PAKE authentication code,
    which was experimental, never enabled and has been
    unmaintained for some time.
  * ssh(1): skip 'exec' clauses other clauses predicates failed
    to match while processing Match blocks.
  * ssh(1): if hostname canonicalisation is enabled and results
    in the destination hostname being changed, then re-parse
    ssh_config(5) files using the new destination hostname. This
    gives 'Host' and 'Match' directives that use the expanded
    hostname a chance to be applied.
  Bugfixes:
  * ssh(1): avoid spurious "getsockname failed: Bad file
    descriptor" in ssh -W. bz#2200, debian#738692
  * sshd(8): allow the shutdown(2) syscall in seccomp-bpf and
    systrace sandbox modes, as it is reachable if the connection
    is terminated during the pre-auth phase.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix unsigned overflow that in SSH protocol 1
    bignum parsing. Minimum key length checks render this bug
    unexploitable to compromise SSH 1 sessions.
  * sshd_config(5): clarify behaviour of a keyword that appears
    in multiple matching Match blocks. bz#2184
  * ssh(1): avoid unnecessary hostname lookups when
    canonicalisation is disabled. bz#2205
  * sshd(8): avoid sandbox violation crashes in GSSAPI code by
    caching the supported list of GSSAPI mechanism OIDs before
    entering the sandbox. bz#2107
  * ssh(1): fix possible crashes in SOCKS4 parsing caused by
    assumption that the SOCKS username is nul-terminated.
  * ssh(1): fix regression for UsePrivilegedPort=yes when
    BindAddress is not specified.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix memory leak in ECDSA signature
    verification.
  * ssh(1): fix matching of 'Host' directives in ssh_config(5)
    files to be case-insensitive again (regression in 6.5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 12 01:24:16 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Update to 6.5p1
  Features since 6.4p1:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): support for key exchange using ECDH in
    Daniel Bernstein's Curve25519; default when both the client
    and server support it.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): support for Ed25519 as a public key type fo
    rboth server and client.  Ed25519 is an EC signature offering
    better security than ECDSA and DSA and good performance.
  * Add a new private key format that uses a bcrypt KDF to better
    protect keys at rest. Used unconditionally for Ed25519 keys,
    on demand for other key types via the -o ssh-keygen(1)
    option.  Intended to become default in the near future.
    Details documented in PROTOCOL.key.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): new transport cipher
    "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" combining Daniel Bernstein's
    ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 MAC to build an
    authenticated encryption mode. Details documented
    PROTOCOL.chacha20poly1305.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): refuse RSA keys from old proprietary clients
    and servers that use the obsolete RSA+MD5 signature scheme.
    It will still be possible to connect with these
    clients/servers but only DSA keys will be accepted, and
    OpenSSH will refuse connection entirely in a future release.
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): refuse old proprietary clients and servers
    that use a weaker key exchange hash calculation.
  * ssh(1): increase the size of the Diffie-Hellman groups
    requested for each symmetric key size. New values from NIST
    Special Publication 800-57 with the upper limit specified by
    RFC4419.
  * ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): support pkcs#11 tokens that only
    provide X.509 certs instead of raw public keys (requested as
    bz#1908).
  * ssh(1): new ssh_config(5) "Match" keyword that allows
    conditional configuration to be applied by matching on
    hostname, user and result of arbitrary commands.
  * ssh(1): support for client-side hostname canonicalisation
    using a set of DNS suffixes and rules in ssh_config(5). This
    allows unqualified names to be canonicalised to
    fully-qualified domain names to eliminate ambiguity when
    looking up keys in known_hosts or checking host certificate
    names.
  * sftp-server(8): ability to whitelist and/or blacklist sftp
    protocol requests by name.
  * sftp-server(8): sftp "fsync@openssh.com" to support calling
    fsync(2) on an open file handle.
  * sshd(8): ssh_config(5) PermitTTY to disallow TTY allocation,
    mirroring the longstanding no-pty authorized_keys option.
  * ssh(1): ssh_config ProxyUseFDPass option that supports the
    use of ProxyCommands that establish a connection and then
    pass a connected file descriptor back to ssh(1). This allows
    the ProxyCommand to exit rather than staying around to
    transfer data.
  Bugfixes since 6.4p1:
  * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix potential stack exhaustion caused by
    nested certificates.
  * ssh(1): bz#1211: make BindAddress work with
    UsePrivilegedPort.
  * sftp(1): bz#2137: fix the progress meter for resumed
    transfer.
  * ssh-add(1): bz#2187: do not request smartcard PIN when
    removing keys from ssh-agent.
  * sshd(8): bz#2139: fix re-exec fallback when original sshd
    binary cannot be executed.
  * ssh-keygen(1): make relative-specified certificate expiry
    times relative to current time and not the validity start
    time.
  * sshd(8): bz#2161: fix AuthorizedKeysCommand inside a Match
    block.
  * sftp(1): bz#2129: symlinking a file would incorrectly
    canonicalise the target path.
  * ssh-agent(1): bz#2175: fix a use-after-free in the PKCS#11
    agent helper executable.
  * sshd(8): improve logging of sessions to include the user
    name, remote host and port, the session type (shell, command,
    etc.) and allocated TTY (if any).
  * sshd(8): bz#1297: tell the client (via a debug message) when
    their preferred listen address has been overridden by the
    server's GatewayPorts setting.
  * sshd(8): bz#2162: include report port in bad protocol banner
    message.
  * sftp(1): bz#2163: fix memory leak in error path in
    do_readdir().
  * sftp(1): bz#2171: don't leak file descriptor on error.
  * sshd(8): include the local address and port in "Connection
    from ..." message (only shown at loglevel>=verbose).
- systemd systems
  * create sysconfig file on systemd systems as well, yet do not
    require it at run-time (bnc#862600)
  * symlink rcsshd to /usr/bin/service
- rename "-forcepermissions" patch to "-sftp_force_permissions"
- disable key converter - ssh-keygen is able to do the same

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 24 15:13:09 UTC 2014 - pcerny@suse.com

- Update to 6.4p1
  Features since 6.2p2:
  * ssh-agent(1) support in sshd(8); allows encrypted hostkeys, or
    hostkeys on smartcards.
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): allow optional time-based rekeying via a
    second argument to the existing RekeyLimit option. RekeyLimit
    is now supported in sshd_config as well as on the client.
  * sshd(8): standardise logging of information during user
    authentication.
  * The presented key/cert and the remote username (if available)
    is now logged in the authentication success/failure message on
    the same log line as the local username, remote host/port and
    protocol in use.  Certificates contents and the key
    fingerprint of the signing CA are logged too.
  * ssh(1) ability to query what cryptographic algorithms are
    supported in the binary.
  * ssh(1): ProxyCommand=- for cases where stdin and stdout
    already point to the proxy.
  * ssh(1): allow IdentityFile=none
  * ssh(1)/sshd(8): -E option to append debugging logs to a
    specified file instead of stderr or syslog.
  * sftp(1): support resuming partial downloads with the "reget"
    command and on the sftp commandline or on the "get"
    commandline with the "-a" (append) option.
  * ssh(1): "IgnoreUnknown" configuration option to selectively
    suppress errors arising from unknown configuration directives.
  * sshd(8): support for submethods to be appended to required
    authentication methods listed via AuthenticationMethods.
  Bugfixes since 6.2p2:
  * sshd(8): fix refusal to accept certificate if a key of a
    different type to the CA key appeared in authorized_keys
    before the CA key.
  * ssh(1)/ssh-agent(1)/sshd(8): Use a monotonic time source for
    timers so that things like keepalives and rekeying will work
    properly over clock steps.
  * sftp(1): update progressmeter when data is acknowledged, not
    when it's sent. bz#2108
  * ssh(1)/ssh-keygen(1): improve error messages when the current
    user does not exist in /etc/passwd; bz#2125
  * ssh(1): reset the order in which public keys are tried after
    partial authentication success.
  * ssh-agent(1): clean up socket files after SIGINT when in debug
    mode; bz#2120

    controlling terminal.
  * sftp(1): avoid crashes in libedit when it has been compiled
    with multi- byte character support. bz#1990
  * sshd(8): when running sshd -D, close stderr unless we have
    explicitly requested logging to stderr. bz#1976,
  * ssh(1): fix incomplete bzero; bz#2100
  * sshd(8): log and error and exit if ChrootDirectory is
    specified and running without root privileges.
  * Many improvements to the regression test suite. In particular
    log files are now saved from ssh and sshd after failures.
  * Fix a number of memory leaks. bz#1967 bz#2096 and others
  * sshd(8): fix public key authentication when a :style is
    appended to the requested username.
  * ssh(1): do not fatally exit when attempting to cleanup
    multiplexing- created channels that are incompletely opened.
    bz#2079
  * sshd(8): fix a memory corruption problem triggered during
    rekeying when an AES-GCM cipher is selected
  * Fix unaligned accesses in umac.c for strict-alignment
    architectures.  bz#2101
  * Fix broken incorrect commandline reporting errors. bz#1448
  * Only include SHA256 and ECC-based key exchange methods if

Tue Nov 13 10:26:37 UTC 2012 - meissner@suse.com

- Updated to 6.1p1, a bugfix release
  Features:
 * sshd(8): This release turns on pre-auth sandboxing sshd by default for
   new installs, by setting UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox in sshd_config.
 * ssh-keygen(1): Add options to specify starting line number and number of
   lines to process when screening moduli candidates, allowing processing
   of different parts of a candidate moduli file in parallel
 * sshd(8): The Match directive now supports matching on the local (listen)
   address and port upon which the incoming connection was received via
   LocalAddress and LocalPort clauses.
 * sshd(8): Extend sshd_config Match directive to allow setting AcceptEnv
   and {Allow,Deny}{Users,Groups}
 * Add support for RFC6594 SSHFP DNS records for ECDSA key types. bz#1978
 * ssh-keygen(1): Allow conversion of RSA1 keys to public PEM and PKCS8
 * sshd(8): Allow the sshd_config PermitOpen directive to accept "none" as
   an argument to refuse all port-forwarding requests.
 * sshd(8): Support "none" as an argument for AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
 * ssh-keyscan(1): Look for ECDSA keys by default. bz#1971
 * sshd(8): Add "VersionAddendum" to sshd_config to allow server operators
   to append some arbitrary text to the server SSH protocol banner.
 Bugfixes:
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Don't spin in accept() in situations of file
   descriptor exhaustion. Instead back off for a while.
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): Remove hmac-sha2-256-96 and hmac-sha2-512-96 MACs as
   they were removed from the specification. bz#2023,
 * sshd(8): Handle long comments in config files better. bz#2025
 * ssh(1): Delay setting tty_flag so RequestTTY options are correctly
   picked up. bz#1995
 * sshd(8): Fix handling of /etc/nologin incorrectly being applied to root
   on platforms that use login_cap.
 Portable OpenSSH:
 * sshd(8): Allow sshd pre-auth sandboxing to fall-back to the rlimit
   sandbox from the Linux SECCOMP filter sandbox when the latter is
   not available in the kernel.
 * ssh(1): Fix NULL dereference when built with LDNS and using DNSSEC to
   retrieve a CNAME SSHFP record.
 * Fix cross-compilation problems related to pkg-config. bz#1996

- By default openSSH checks at *runtime* if the openssl 
  API version matches with the running library, that might
  be good if you are compiling SSH yourself but it is a totally
  insane way to check for binary/source compatibility in a distribution.

- specfile/patches cleanup 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 24 11:24:59 UTC 2011 - lchiquitto@novell.com

- Update to 5.7p1
 * Implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography modes for key exchange (ECDH)
   and host/user keys (ECDSA) as specified by RFC5656.
 * sftp(1)/sftp-server(8): add a protocol extension to support a hard
   link operation.
 * scp(1): Add a new -3 option to scp: Copies between two remote hosts
   are transferred through the local host.
 * ssh(1): automatically order the hostkeys requested by the client
   based on which hostkeys are already recorded in known_hosts.
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): add a new IPQoS option to specify arbitrary
   TOS/DSCP/QoS values instead of hardcoding lowdelay/throughput.
 * sftp(1): the sftp client is now significantly faster at performing
   directory listings, using OpenBSD glob(3) extensions to preserve
   the results of stat(3) operations performed in the course of its
   execution rather than performing expensive round trips to fetch
   them again afterwards.
 * ssh(1): "atomically" create the listening mux socket by binding it on
   a temporary name and then linking it into position after listen() has
   succeeded.
 * ssh(1)/sshd(8): add a KexAlgorithms knob to the client and server
   configuration to allow selection of which key exchange methods are
   used by ssh(1) and sshd(8) and their order of preference.
 * sftp(1)/scp(1): factor out bandwidth limiting code from scp(1) into
   a generic bandwidth limiter that can be attached using the atomicio
   callback mechanism and use it to add a bandwidth limit option to
   sftp(1).
 * Support building against openssl-1.0.0a.
 * Bug fixes.
- Remove patches that are now upstream:
 * openssh-5.6p1-tmpdir.diff
 * openssh-linux-new-oomkill.patch
- Add upstream patch to fix build with SELinux enabled.

- update to 5.6p1
 * Added a ControlPersist option to ssh_config(5) that automatically
   starts a background ssh(1) multiplex master when connecting.
 * Hostbased authentication may now use certificate host keys.
 * ssh-keygen(1) now supports signing certificate using a CA key that
   has been stored in a PKCS#11 token.
 * ssh(1) will now log the hostname and address that we connected to at
   LogLevel=verbose after authentication is successful to mitigate
   "phishing" attacks by servers with trusted keys that accept
   authentication silently and automatically before presenting fake
   password/passphrase prompts.
 * Expand %h to the hostname in ssh_config Hostname options.
 * Allow ssh-keygen(1) to import (-i) and export (-e) of PEM and PKCS#8
   keys in addition to RFC4716 (SSH.COM) encodings via a new -m option 
 * sshd(8) will now queue debug messages for bad ownership or
   permissions on the user's keyfiles encountered during authentication
   and will send them after authentication has successfully completed.
 * ssh(1) connection multiplexing now supports remote forwarding with
   dynamic port allocation and can report the allocated port back to
   the user
 * sshd(8) now supports indirection in matching of principal names
   listed in certificates.
 * sshd(8) now has a new AuthorizedPrincipalsFile option to specify a
   file containing a list of names that may be accepted in place of the
   username when authorizing a certificate trusted via the
   sshd_config(5) TrustedCAKeys option.
 * Additional sshd_config(5) options are now valid inside Match blocks
 * Revised the format of certificate keys.
 * bugfixes

  users for further host hopping).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 23 18:57:07 CET 2010 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 5.4p1
 * After a transition period of about 10 years, this release disables
   SSH protocol 1 by default. Clients and servers that need to use the
   legacy protocol must explicitly enable it in ssh_config / sshd_config
   or on the command-line.
 * Remove the libsectok/OpenSC-based smartcard code and add support for
   PKCS#11 tokens. This support is automatically enabled on all
   platforms that support dlopen(3) and was inspired by patches written
   by Alon Bar-Lev. Details in the ssh(1) and ssh-add(1) manpages.
 * Add support for certificate authentication of users and hosts using a
   new, minimal OpenSSH certificate format (not X.509). Certificates
   contain a public key, identity information and some validity
   constraints and are signed with a standard SSH public key using
   ssh-keygen(1). CA keys may be marked as trusted in authorized_keys
   or via a TrustedUserCAKeys option in sshd_config(5) (for user
   authentication), or in known_hosts (for host authentication).
   Documentation for certificate support may be found in ssh-keygen(1),
   sshd(8) and ssh(1) and a description of the protocol extensions in
   PROTOCOL.certkeys.
 * Added a 'netcat mode' to ssh(1): "ssh -W host:port ..." This connects
   stdio on the client to a single port forward on the server. This
   allows, for example, using ssh as a ProxyCommand to route connections
   via intermediate servers. bz#1618
 * Add the ability to revoke keys in sshd(8) and ssh(1). User keys may
   be revoked using a new sshd_config(5) option "RevokedKeys". Host keys
   are revoked through known_hosts (details in the sshd(8) man page).
   Revoked keys cannot be used for user or host authentication and will
   trigger a warning if used.
 * Rewrite the ssh(1) multiplexing support to support non-blocking
   operation of the mux master, improve the resilience of the master to
   malformed messages sent to it by the slave and add support for
   requesting port- forwardings via the multiplex protocol. The new
   stdio-to-local forward mode ("ssh -W host:port ...") is also
   supported. The revised multiplexing protocol is documented in the
   file PROTOCOL.mux in the source distribution.
 * Add a 'read-only' mode to sftp-server(8) that disables open in write
   mode and all other fs-modifying protocol methods. bz#430
 * Allow setting an explicit umask on the sftp-server(8) commandline to
   override whatever default the user has. bz#1229
 * Many improvements to the sftp(1) client, many of which were
   implemented by Carlos Silva through the Google Summer of Code
   program:
   - Support the "-h" (human-readable units) flag for ls
   - Implement tab-completion of commands, local and remote filenames
   - Support most of scp(1)'s commandline arguments in sftp(1), as a
     first step towards making sftp(1) a drop-in replacement for scp(1).
     Note that the rarely-used "-P sftp_server_path" option has been
     moved to "-D sftp_server_path" to make way for "-P port" to match
     scp(1).
   - Add recursive transfer support for get/put and on the commandline
 * New RSA keys will be generated with a public exponent of RSA_F4 ==
   (2**16)+1 == 65537 instead of the previous value 35.
 * Passphrase-protected SSH protocol 2 private keys are now protected
   with AES-128 instead of 3DES. This applied to newly-generated keys
   as well as keys that are reencrypted (e.g. by changing their
   passphrase).

Mon Feb 23 17:27:45 CET 2009 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 5.2p1
 * This release changes the default cipher order to prefer the AES CTR
   modes and the revised "arcfour256" mode to CBC mode ciphers that are
   susceptible to CPNI-957037 "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH".
 * This release also adds countermeasures to mitigate CPNI-957037-style
   attacks against the SSH protocol's use of CBC-mode ciphers. Upon
   detection of an invalid packet length or Message Authentication
   Code, ssh/sshd will continue reading up to the maximum supported
   packet length rather than immediately terminating the connection.
   This eliminates most of the known differences in behaviour that
   leaked information about the plaintext of injected data which formed
   the basis of this attack. We believe that these attacks are rendered
   infeasible by these changes.
 * Added a -y option to ssh(1) to force logging to syslog rather than
   stderr, which is useful when running daemonised (ssh -f)
 * The sshd_config(5) ForceCommand directive now accepts commandline
   arguments for the internal-sftp server.
 * The ssh(1) ~C escape commandline now support runtime creation of
   dynamic (-D) port forwards.
 * Support the SOCKS4A protocol in ssh(1) dynamic (-D) forwards.
   (bz#1482)
 * Support remote port forwarding with a listen port of '0'. This
   informs the server that it should dynamically allocate a listen
   port and report it back to the client. (bz#1003)
 * sshd(8) now supports setting PermitEmptyPasswords and
   AllowAgentForwarding in Match blocks
 * Repair a ssh(1) crash introduced in openssh-5.1 when the client is
   sent a zero-length banner (bz#1496)
 * Due to interoperability problems with certain
   broken SSH implementations, the eow@openssh.com and
   no-more-sessions@openssh.com protocol extensions are now only sent
   to peers that identify themselves as OpenSSH.
 * Make ssh(1) send the correct channel number for
   SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS and SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE messages to
   avoid triggering 'Non-public channel' error messages on sshd(8) in
   openssh-5.1.
 * Avoid printing 'Non-public channel' warnings in sshd(8), since the
   ssh(1) has sent incorrect channel numbers since ~2004 (this reverts
   a behaviour introduced in openssh-5.1).
 * Avoid double-free in ssh(1) ~C escape -L handler (bz#1539)
 * Correct fail-on-error behaviour in sftp(1) batchmode for remote
   stat operations. (bz#1541)
 * Disable nonfunctional ssh(1) ~C escape handler in multiplex slave
   connections. (bz#1543)
 * Avoid hang in ssh(1) when attempting to connect to a server that
   has MaxSessions=0 set.
 * Multiple fixes to sshd(8) configuration test (-T) mode
 * Several core and portable OpenSSH bugs fixed: 1380, 1412, 1418,
   1419, 1421, 1490, 1491, 1492, 1514, 1515, 1518, 1520, 1538, 1540

   address" blocks, with a fallback to classic wildcard matching.
 * sshd(8) now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   from="..." restrictions, also with a fallback to classic wildcard
   matching.
 * Added an extended test mode (-T) to sshd(8) to request that it write
   its effective configuration to stdout and exit. Extended test mode
   also supports the specification of connection parameters (username,
   source address and hostname) to test the application of
   sshd_config(5) Match rules. 
 * ssh(1) now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall
   connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose
   mode (previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1
   connections only).
 * sftp-server(8) now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com and
   fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs(2)-like operations.
 * sftp(1) now has a "df" command to the sftp client that uses the
   statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df(1)-like display of filesystem
   space and inode utilisation (requires statvfs@openssh.com support on
   the server)
 * Added a MaxSessions option to sshd_config(5) to allow control of the
   number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP connection.
   This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions above the
   previous default of 10, disabling connection multiplexing 
   (MaxSessions=1) or disallowing login/shell/subsystem sessions
   entirely (MaxSessions=0).
 * Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that is
   sent from ssh(1) to sshd(8) when the client knows that it will never
   request another session (i.e. when session multiplexing is disabled). 
   This allows a server to disallow further session requests and
   terminate the session in cases where the client has been hijacked.
 * ssh-keygen(1) now supports the use of the -l option in combination
   with -F to search for a host in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and display its 
   fingerprint.
 * ssh-keyscan(1) now defaults to "rsa" (protocol 2) keys, instead of
   "rsa1".
 * Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to sshd_config(8) to control
   whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted. Note that this
   is a loose control, as a client may install their own unofficial
   forwarder.
 * ssh(1) and sshd(8): avoid unnecessary malloc/copy/free when receiving
   network data, resulting in a ~10% speedup
 * ssh(1) and sshd(8) will now try additional addresses when connecting
   to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than
   one address. The previous behaviour was to try the only first address
   and give up if that failed. (bz#383)
 * ssh(1) and sshd(8) now support signalling that channels are
   half-closed for writing, through a channel protocol extension
   notification "eow@openssh.com". This allows propagation of closed
   file descriptors, so that commands such as:
       "ssh -2 localhost od /bin/ls | true"
   do not send unnecessary data over the wire. (bz#85)
 * sshd(8): increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys 
   from 768 to 1024 bits.
 * When ssh(1) has been requested to fork after authentication
   ("ssh -f") with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled, delay the fork until
   after replies for any -R forwards have been seen. Allows for robust
   detection of -R forward failure when using -f. (bz#92)
 * "Match group" blocks in sshd_config(5) now support negation of
   groups. E.g. "Match group staff,!guests" (bz#1315)
 * sftp(1) and sftp-server(8) now allow chmod-like operations to set 
   set[ug]id/sticky bits. (bz#1310)
 * The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in sshd_config(5) match
   blocks.
 * Multiplexed ssh(1) sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes
   that are available to a primary connection. (bz#1331)
 * ssh(1) connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new
   connection in most error cases. (bz#1439 bz#1329)
 * Added some basic interoperability tests against Twisted Conch.
 * Documented OpenSSH's extensions to and deviations from the published
   SSH protocols (the PROTOCOL file in the distribution)
 * Documented OpenSSH's ssh-agent protocol (PROTOCOL.agent).
 * bugfixes

 * CVE-2008-1483: Avoid possible hijacking of X11-forwarded 
   connections by refusing to listen on a port unless all address 
   families bind successfully.
- remove CVE-2008-1483 patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 14:57:26 CEST 2008 - anicka@suse.cz

- update to 4.9p1 
  * Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc for sessions where a command has been
    forced by the sshd_config ForceCommand directive. Users who had
    write access to this file could use it to execute abritrary commands.
    This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe default and an extra
    hassle for administrators.
  * Added chroot(2) support for sshd(8), controlled by a new option
    "ChrootDirectory". Please refer to sshd_config(5) for details, and
    please use this feature carefully. (bz#177 bz#1352)
  * Linked sftp-server(8) into sshd(8). The internal sftp server is
    used when the command "internal-sftp" is specified in a Subsystem
    or ForceCommand declaration. When used with ChrootDirectory, the
    internal sftp server requires no special configuration of files
    inside the chroot environment. Please refer to sshd_config(5) for
    more information.
  * Added a "no-user-rc" option for authorized_keys to disable execution
    of ~/.ssh/rc
  * Added a protocol extension method "posix-rename@openssh.com" for
    sftp-server(8) to perform POSIX atomic rename() operations.
    (bz#1400)
  * Removed the fixed limit of 100 file handles in sftp-server(8). The
    server will now dynamically allocate handles up to the number of
    available file descriptors. (bz#1397)
  * ssh(8) will now skip generation of SSH protocol 1 ephemeral server
    keys when in inetd mode and protocol 2 connections are negotiated.
    This speeds up protocol 2 connections to inetd-mode servers that
    also allow Protocol 1 (bz#440)
  * Accept the PermitRootLogin directive in a sshd_config(5) Match
    block. Allows for, e.g. permitting root only from the local
    network.
  * Reworked sftp(1) argument splitting and escaping to be more
    internally consistent (i.e. between sftp commands) and more
    consistent with sh(1). Please note that this will change the
    interpretation of some quoted strings, especially those with
    embedded backslash escape sequences. (bz#778)
  * Support "Banner=none" in sshd_config(5) to disable sending of a
    pre-login banner (e.g. in a Match block).
  * ssh(1) ProxyCommands are now executed with $SHELL rather than
    /bin/sh.
  * ssh(1)'s ConnectTimeout option is now applied to both the TCP
    connection and the SSH banner exchange (previously it just covered
    the TCP connection). This allows callers of ssh(1) to better detect
    and deal with stuck servers that accept a TCP connection but don't
    progress the protocol, and also makes ConnectTimeout useful for
    connections via a ProxyCommand.
  * Many new regression tests, including interop tests against PuTTY's
    plink.
  * Support BSM auditing on Mac OS X
  * bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 23 15:02:00 CEST 2003 - draht@suse.de

- New version 3.7.1p2; signature from 86FF9C48 Damien Miller
  verified for source tarball. Bugs fixed with this version:
  #31637 (CAN-2003-0786, CAN-2003-0786). Briefly:
  1) SSH1 PAM challenge response auth ignored the result of the
     authentication (with privsep off)
  2) The PAM conversation function trashed the stack, by referring
     to the **resp parameter as an array of pointers rather than
     as a pointer to an array of struct pam_responses.
  At least security bug 1) is exploitable.
