Subject: [PATCH] Only set PAM_RHOST if the remote host is not "UNKNOWN"

When using sshd's -i option with stdio that is not a AF_INET/AF_INET6
socket, auth_get_canonical_hostname() returns "UNKNOWN" which is then
set as the value of PAM_RHOST, causing pam to try to do a reverse DNS
query of "UNKNOWN", which times out multiple times, causing a
substantial slowdown when logging in.

To fix this, let's only set PAM_RHOST if the hostname is not "UNKNOWN".
