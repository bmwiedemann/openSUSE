- Update to version 0.3.1:
  * Updated the C++ code to not depend on functions deprecated in
    Octave 4.2.
  * Modernised the code in general to work well with Octave 5.1.
  * Specified dependency on "parallel" as well as bumped minimum
    required Octave version.
- Use _service file to download source directly from upstream git
  repository as updated version hasn't been released as tarball.
- Bump minimum required octave version to 4.0 as expected by
  upstream.
- Require octave-forge-parallel.
- Switch to BuildArch: noarch as package doesn't install any
  arch-dependent binaries any more.

- Update to version 0.3.0
  * ls_genbasic can now be called with arbitrary coordinates, they need
    not correspond to the full grid.  In particular, single points
    can be passed as arguments as well.
  * Add new routines for shape optimisation with level sets. The main
    one is so_run_descent.
  * Allow saving and replaying shape optimisation descents. This is
    accomplished with so_save_descent and so_replay_descent. Also
    so_explore_descent can be used to interactively explore a descent log.
