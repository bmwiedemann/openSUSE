Fri Sep 26 10:43:14 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  Examples for the new features can be found in the release notes:
  https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v1.9.0
  * Compile Rego Queries Into SQL Filters (#7887)
    Compile API extensions with support for SQL filter generation
    previously exclusive to EOPA has been ported into OPA.
  * Improved Rule Indexing For "Naked" Refs (#7897)
    OPA's rule indexer is a means by which OPA can optimize
    evaluation performance.
    Briefly, the indexer can in some cases determine that a rule
    won't successfully evaluate before it's evaluated based on the
    query input.
    The indexer previously only considered terms in certain
    compound expressions, ignoring single terms; e.g. an expression
    containing a sole "naked" ref. This has now changed!

  * This release contains a mix of new features, performance
    improvements, and bugfixes. Notably:
    Support for EdDSA signatures in io.jwt built-ins, including a

Mon Jun 30 16:15:08 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  * This release contains a mix of new features, performance
    improvements, and bugfixes. Notably:
    - Improvements to the OPA website and documentation
    - Allowing keywords in Rego references
    - Parallel test execution
    - Faster built-in function execution
  * Allowing keywords in Rego references (#7709)
    Previously, Rego references could not contain terms that
    conflict with Rego keywords such as package, if, else, not,
    etc.  in certain constructs:

      package example

      allow if {
          input.package.source         # not allowed (before v1.6.0)
          input["package"].destination # allowed
      }

    The constraints for valid Rego references have been relaxed to
    allow keywords.
    The above example is now valid and will no longer cause a
    compilation error.
  * Parallel Test Execution (#7442)
    By default, OPA will now run tests in parallel (defaulting to
    one parallel execution thread per available CPU core),
    significantly speeding up test execution time for large test
    suites.
    The performance boost is closely tied to the number of tests in
    your project and your selected parallelism level. For larger
    projects and default settings, 2-3x performance gains have been
    measured on a MacBook Pro.
    Parallelism can be disabled to run tests sequentially by
    setting the --parallel flag to 1. E.g. opa test . --parallel=1.
  * Faster Builtin Function Evaluation
    The builtin context, an internal construct of OPA's evaluation
    engine, was previously provided to every builtin function.
    As it turns out, only very few of them actually need it, for
    caching, cancellation, or lookups.
    Those builtins are still provided with a builtin context, but
    for calls to all other builtins, we save the memory required by
    it.
    The impact is tremendous: Even though the size of a single
    builtin context is only about 270 bytes, in an example
    application (Regal), this change brings about 360 MB of reduced
    memory usage!
  * Runtime, Tooling, SDK
    - cmd/check: opa check --bundle report virtual/base doc
      conflicts (#7701) authored by @anderseknert
    - When opa check is used with the --bundle flag, an error will
      be reported if the provided json/yaml data has a conflicting
      overlap with the virtual documents generated by Rego rules.
      Such conflicts are ambiguous and can lead to unexpected
      evaluation results, and should be resolved.

      (#7644) authored by @olegKoshmeliuk
    - Note: This is only applicable for the web UI hosted by OPA on
      its root path (/) and OPA is served at some other path than
      root.
  * Compiler, Topdown and Rego
    - ast: Ensure surplus leading zeros always error (#7726)
      authored by @charlieegan3
    - Note: Primitive Rego number values with leading zeros (e.g.
      0123) are now considered invalid at time of parsing and will
      generate an error. If you're impacted by this change, please
      update your policies to not have numbers with leading zeros.
      E.g. 0123 should be changed to 123.

  This is a security fix release for the fixes published in Go
  1.24.1 and 1.24.2
  * build: bump go to 1.24.2 (#7544) (authored by @sspaink)
    Addressing CVE-2025-22870 and CVE-2025-22871 vulnerabilities in
    the Go runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 14:34:10 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  This release contains a security fix addressing CVE-2025-46569.
  It also includes a mix of new features, bugfixes, and dependency
  updates.
  * Security Fix: CVE-2025-46569 - OPA server Data API HTTP path
    injection of Rego (GHSA-6m8w-jc87-6cr7)
    A vulnerability in the OPA server's Data API allows an attacker
    to craft the HTTP path in a way that injects Rego code into the
    query that is evaluated.
    The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data
    than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can
    be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to
    make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks
    or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision
    results.
    Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be
    computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service
    (DoS) attack.
    Users are only impacted if all of the following apply:
    - OPA is deployed as a standalone server (rather than being
      used as a Go library)
    - The OPA server is exposed outside of the local host in an
      untrusted environment.
    - The configured authorization policy does not do exact
      matching of the input.path attribute when deciding if the
      request should be allowed.
    or, if all of the following apply:
    - OPA is deployed as a standalone server.
    - The service connecting to OPA allows 3rd parties to insert
      unsanitised text into the path of the HTTP request to OPA’s
      Data API.
  Note: With no Authorization Policy configured for restricting API
  access (the default configuration), the RESTful Data API provides
  access for managing Rego policies; and the RESTful Query API
  facilitates advanced queries.
  Full access to these APIs provides both simpler, and broader
  access than what the security issue describes here can
  facilitate.
  As such, OPA servers exposed to a network are not considered
  affected by the attack described here if they are knowingly not
  restricting access through an Authorization Policy.

  This issue affects all versions of OPA prior to 1.4.0.
  See the Security Advisory for more details.
