  <title>Milter based implementation of DKIM</title>
  <description>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) lets an organization take responsibility for
a message that is in transit.  The organization is a handler of the message,
either as its originator or as an intermediary. Their reputation is the basis
for evaluating whether to trust the message for further handling, such as
delivery. Technically DKIM provides a method for validating a domain name
identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic
authentication.
