- Update to version 1.3.0:
  * New functions:
    idxmatrix: creates a matrix with each element corresponding to
    its subindex in the matrix.
    hc2ind: Hilbert curve to linear indices
  * The function publish has been removed from the miscellaneous
    package because it is now released with Octave core since
    version 4.2.  Note that it's API is slightly different.
  * The package is no longer dependent on the general package.
  * pkg update for octave 5.1+ functionality
