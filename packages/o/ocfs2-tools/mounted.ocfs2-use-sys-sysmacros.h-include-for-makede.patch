Subject: [PATCH] mounted.ocfs2: use <sys/sysmacros.h> include for makedev
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

 mounted.c: In function ‘build_partition_list’:
 mounted.c:354:13: warning: In the GNU C Library, "makedev" is defined
  by <sys/sysmacros.h>. For historical compatibility, it is
  currently defined by <sys/types.h> as well, but we plan to
  remove this soon. To use "makedev", include <sys/sysmacros.h>
  directly. If you did not intend to use a system-defined macro
  "makedev", you should undefine it after including <sys/types.h>.
        makedev(major, minor), &devname);
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
