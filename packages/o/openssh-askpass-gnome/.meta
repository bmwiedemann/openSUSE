  <title>Secure Shell Client and Server (Remote Login Program)</title>
  <description>SSH (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into and executing commands
on a remote machine. It is intended to replace rsh (rlogin and rsh) and
provides openssl (secure encrypted communication) between two untrusted
hosts over an insecure network.

xorg-x11 (X Window System) connections and arbitrary TCP/IP ports can
also be forwarded over the secure channel.</description>
