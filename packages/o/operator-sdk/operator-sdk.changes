Tue Jun 03 05:00:35 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.40.0:
  * Additions
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a devcontainer is now
      available to allow users to develop and test the operator in
      a local environment and leverage on solutions such as VS Code
      Remote Containers and GitHub Codespaces to have a consistent
      development environment. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, new GitHub Actions are
      available to ensure better quality of their code. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, controllers now use
      .Named("<Kind>") in SetupWithManager to prevent naming
      conflicts in multi-group projects. (More info). (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a new Makefile target named
      lint-config has been added to verify that your .golangci.yaml
      configuration file is valid. This helps catch issues early
      when customizing lint rules.
    - (More info). (#6928)
    - For ALL-based operators, scaffolded resources now include the
      app.kubernetes.io/name label to support Kubernetes best
      practices for app identification. (More info). (#6928)
    - For ALL-based operators, new role manifests are now
      scaffolded under the config/rbac/ directory to assist cluster
      administrators. For each API defined in the project, three
      role files are generated: <kind>_admin_role.yaml,
      <kind>_editor_role.yaml, and <kind>_viewer_role.yaml.
      These roles are not applied by default. Instead, they are
      provided as helpers, allowing cluster administrators to
      customize and apply appropriate permissions as needed.
      The primary motivation for scaffolding these roles is to
      simplify integration with Kubernetes' aggregated roles
      mechanism. By including annotations such as
      rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true",
      rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true", and
      rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true", these
      role definitions can automatically contribute permissions to
      the default admin, edit, and view roles in a cluster when
      applied.
      For more information on Kubernetes RBAC and aggregated roles,
      see:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/.

      (#6928)
  * Changes
    - The bundle build target now respects the CONTAINER_TOOL
      variable, allowing users to use alternative container tools
      like podman instead of docker. (#6932)
    - For All-based Operators, upgrade OPM to version from v1.23.0
      to v1.55.0, which includes several bug fixes and
      improvements. For further information, see:
      https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases.
      (#6953)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based Operators, the main.go file has been
      enhanced to support real TLS certificates for both webhooks
      and the metrics server, with automated certificate rotation
      via cert-manager. This change improves security and aligns
      with production-grade best practices.
      Previously, setups relied on kube-rbac-proxy (deprecated in
      Operator SDK and Kubebuilder, see:
      kubebuilder/discussions/3907), which generated TLS
      certificates dynamically — a method no longer recommended for
      secure environments. The updated approach adopts static
      certificates managed by cert-manager.
      Additionally, integrations with Prometheus now support
      scraping metrics using the cert-manager generated
      certificates. A related fix was introduced to ensure that CA
      injection patches are only applied to CRDs with a conversion
      webhook, avoiding unnecessary annotations.
      To support these improvements, changes to
      config/default/kustomization.yaml are required. These
      include: configuring webhook and metrics server certificates,
      enabling Prometheus scraping with TLS, and correcting CA
      injection behavior.
      These updates also introduce flexible opt-in mechanisms,
      allowing users to selectively enable or disable: - TLS for
      the metrics server via cert-manager - TLS for webhooks via
      cert-manager - TLS configuration for Prometheus scraping
      Together, these changes are part of a broader effort to
      elevate the default security posture and configurability of
      Go-based operators. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a fix has been implemented to
      ensure that the Prometheus configuration can properly scrape
      metrics from the operator's metrics server when TLS is
      enabled. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, a fix has been implemented to
      ensure that CA injection patches are applied only to CRDs
      that define a conversion webhook.
      Previously, the CA injection patch logic was overly broad —
      applying injection annotations to all CRDs whenever a webhook
      was scaffolded with the --conversion flag. This behavior was
      introduced in Kubebuilder release v3.5.0 when replacements
      were introduced in place of legacy vars and the
      kustomize/v2-alpha plugin was adopted.
      The incorrect behavior likely went unnoticed due to
      incomplete support for conversion webhooks in earlier
      versions. This release addresses that gap, enabling proper
      scaffolding and CA injection behavior specifically for CRDs
      with conversion webhooks.
      To support this improvement, a new marker has been
      introduced: +kubebuilder:scaffold:crdkustomizecainjectionns.
      This marker ensures that the correct replacements are
      generated in config/default/kustomization.yaml for CA
      injection. Additionally, the
      kubebuilder:scaffold:crdkustomizewebhookpatch marker was
      created to ensure that the webhook patch is only applied to
      CRDs that have a conversion webhook in the
      config/crd/kustomization.yaml file.
      For more information on this and other scaffolding markers,
      refer to the official Kubebuilder documentation:
      https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers/scaffold.
      (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, ENVTEST version management is
      now automated by deriving values from go.mod, and controller
      tests now locate binaries dynamically. (More info)
      These updates improve the developer experience by: - Reducing
      manual configuration for ENVTEST. - Ensuring IDEs or test
      runners can locate the binaries reliably. - Making controller
      test scaffolding more robust and portable. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, updated GolangCI-Lint
      configuration to replace the deprecated exportloopref linter
      with the copyloopvar linter. (#6928)
    - (go/v4) For Go-based operators, upgraded project scaffolding
      to Go 1.23, Kubernetes v0.32.1, and controller-runtime
      v0.20.4.
    - The default project scaffolding for Go-based operators has
      been updated to use:
      - Go 1.23
      - Kubernetes modules v0.32.1
      - controller-runtime v0.20.4
      - Ginkgo v2.22.0 and Gomega v1.36.1. (#6928)
    - Breaking change: (go/v4) For Go-based operators, upgraded
      controller-runtime from v0.19.4 to v0.20.0 and added support
      for Kubernetes 1.32. Removed deprecated webhook.Validator and
      webhook.Defaulter interfaces from the runtime. Webhooks
      should no longer reside under the api/ directory—this has
      been the default behavior since Kubebuilder rlease
      [v4.3.0)(https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v4.3.0).
      A --legacy=true flag was added to support scaffolding
      webhooks in the old layout when needed. (More info ·
      Migration guide). (#6928)
