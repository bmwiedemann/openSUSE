- Update to version 0.2.106
  * [IT] Increase the number of max-samples to match openMPT (it
    can export files with more samples that original tracker and
    Schism supports).
  * [devpdisk] Reported time during playback was random.
  * [adplug] Add support for SudoMakers RetroWave OPL3 Express,
    please configure it in setup:/adplugconfig.dev
  * [adplug] Make channel tracker aware of AM/FM modes so it more
    correctly can display visualization.
  * [adplug] Left/Right OPL3 logic was incorrect in the
    register-tracker.
  * [libancient] Add more fingerprints for compression formats
    that v2.1.0 can decompress.
  * [Linux CDROM] Fix deadlock.
  * [configure] cleanup --bindir --libdir and --datadir, and new
    syntax to override post ocp suffixes:
    ./configure LIBDIROCP=/usr/lib/ocp DATADIROCP=/usr/data/ocp
  * [configure] removed --with-dir-suffix
  * [CDROM *.CUE] REM didn't work as expected.
  * [CDROM *.CUE] files didn't work if containing INDEX 00.
  * [CDROM *.CUE] BINARY keyword should be little endian, but
    there are tools that produce big-endian files without marking
    them correctly. So we need to detect the endian used.
  * [CDROM *.CUE] files didn't include pregaps in the track table.
  * [CDROM *.TOC] files didn't split the logic for pregap and
    offset into the raw file.
  * [musicbrainz] Increase the buffersize, some data retrivals
    failed.
  * [global MIME database] Add adplug fileformats.
  * [global MIME database] Add Game Music Emulator fileformats.
  * [SDL2] if entering fullscreen while in graphical effect mode,
    it could not be exited without visiting a textmode resolution.
  * [SDL2] Use SDL_OpenAudioDevice(), else the expected audio
    format between SDL2 and OCP might not be what we expect
    causing random noise to be played.
  * [X11] non-Shm usage could fail to successfully create butter
    on window resize.
  * [X11] If background picture is loaded in GUI modes, it was not
    repainted on window-resize.
  * [unifont] Allow for unifont ttf/otf files to be placed in the
    datadir by using ./configure --with-unifont-relative (you still
    need to copy the files in).
  * [*.VGZ] Silently convert them to *.VGM
  * [GME] Add support for Game Music Emulator library (libgme) for
    playback of various retro console systems.

    the core plugins are statically linked in.
  * version 0.2.91 update missed setting the color for XM files
    in ocp.ini
  * Fix logic for setting screenmode vs ocp.ini. This is now the
    scheme and default values that SDL, SDL2 and X11 drivers use:
    [screen]
      screentype=5            ; 0=80x25, 1=80x30, 2=80x50, 3=80x60,
      4=132x25, 5=132x30, 6=132x50, 7=132x60, 8=custom
      fontsize=1              ; if screentype=8: 0=8x8, 1=8x16
      winwidth=1024           ; if screentype=8
      winheight=768           ; if screentype=8
  * insttype= setting in ocp.ini was no longer working and it was
    not maintained between songs.
  * Remove more external symbols from the devp*.so and devw*.so
    files, and API updates
  * setup:/devp/ and setup:/devw/ directories has been replaced
    with dialogs

    ./configure causing errors later during make instead
