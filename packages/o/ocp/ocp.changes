      4=132x25, 5=132x30, 6=132x50, 7=132x60, 8=custom
      fontsize=1              ; if screentype=8: 0=8x8, 1=8x16
      winwidth=1024           ; if screentype=8
      winheight=768           ; if screentype=8
  * insttype= setting in ocp.ini was no longer working and it was
    not maintained between songs.

    files, and API updates
