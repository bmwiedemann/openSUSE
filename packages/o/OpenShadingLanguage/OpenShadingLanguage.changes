- changes from 1.13.6.1
  - New minimum dependencies and compatibility changes:
    - For GPU/OptiX mode, OptiX 6.0 support has been removed. For
      GPU rendering with OptiX, a minimum of OptiX 7.0 is required,
      and the Cuda minimum has been raised to 9.0 #1737
    - The minimum version OpenImageIO has been raised from 2.2 to
      2.4. #1591 #1722
    - The minimum CMake dependency has been raised from 3.12 to
      3.15 #1724 (1.13.5.0)
    - The minimum Imath/OpenEXR has been raised from 2.3 to 2.4.
      (Note: OSL 1.13 is probably the last major release family
      that will support Imath/OpenEXR 2.x.)
  - OSL Language and oslc compiler:
    - There have been no substantive changes to the OSL language in
      this release.
  - ‚õ∞Ô∏è API changes, new options, new ShadingSystem features (for
    renderer writers):
    - A new shadingStateUniform pointer field was added to
      ShaderGlobals for planned future expansion and improved GPU
      support. #1585 (1.13.1.0)
    - Adding relaxed type-equivalency to ReParameter() #1639 (by
      cmstein) (1.13.2.1)
    - Expose llvm groupdata size as a shadergroup attribute #1642
      (by Chris Hellmuth) (1.13.4.0)
    - RendererServices API for letting get_texture_handle consider
      colorspace #1641 (1.13.4.0)
    - Make "compile_report" attribute an int instead of just 0/1.
      Passing 1 makes a brief report, values >1 are more verbose.
      (Zero still prints no report.) #1654 (1.13.4.0)
    - Switch lockgeom to interpolated and interactive. The
      lockgeom=0 was confusing. Now we use interpolated=1 to mean
      "don't optimize it away because it might be interpolated
      across the geometry and thus won't have the same value at all
      points being shaded," and the subtly different interactive=1
      to mean "don't optimize it away because although it will
      always take on the same value at all points at the same time,
      the user might want to interactively adjust the value and we
      don't want to have to recompile the shader group if that
      happens." #1662 (1.13.4.0)
    - Add type information for needed attributes. #1650 (by Curtis
      Black) (1.13.4.0)
    - Add API for building attribute getter free functions. #1704
      (by Curtis Black) (1.13.5.0)
    - Rs fmt specification - Journaling Algorithm for error,
      warning, fprintf #1702 (by Steena Monteiro) #1711 #1715
      (1.13.5.0)
  - üöÄ SIMD batched shading mode
    - Fix some array overruns (asymptomatic, but still potentially
      buggy) in common_ancestor_between. #1577 (1.13.0.2)
    - Fix issue with closure keyword parameters. #1620
      (1.13.2.0/1.12.8.0)
    - Fix crash when adding a default initialized closure. #1624
      (1.13.2.0/1.12.8.0)
    - Fix support for closures with array types. #1630
      (1.13.2.0/1.12.8.0)

      danieldresser-ie) (1.13.2.1)
    - Fix Force LLVM Boolean #1717 (by Alex Wells)
    - Batched pointcloud if "index" is not passed #1753 (by Alex
      Wells)
  - üöÄ OptiX GPU rendering
    - OptiX 6.0 support has been removed. For GPU rendering with
      OptiX, a minimum of OptiX 7.0 is required.
    - Big overhaul/simplification of how strings are represented on
      the GPU: the extra level of indirection to global variables
      is removed, and strings are simply represented in ordinary
      variables as the hash of their characters. #1531 (1.13.0.0)
      #1553 (1.13.0.1)
    - Better PTX cache hit rate by eliminating several sources of
      not being strictly deterministic in the PTX text we were
      generating. #1566 #1570 (1.13.0.1)
    - Fix PTX symbol visibility issues. #1609 (1.13.2.0)
    - Hide more code that is only used for OptiX mode, when OptiX
      is disabled. #1608 (1.13.2.0)
    - Remove dependency on OptiX SDK for building core OSL with
      OptiX support. You can now build OSL with OptiX support
      enabled even if you don't have the OptiX SDK headers present
      at build time. But you will still need them to build your
      OptiX-based application that uses OSL for GPU rendering.

Sat Apr  1 09:50:52 UTC 2023 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- update to 1.12.10.0:
  + feat(testrender): Modify testrender so that it correctly sets
    raytype to "camera" for camera rays, "shadow" for shadow rays,
    and "diffuse" for all secondary rays. Also rerun the shades for
    background shader group on the camera rays rather than use the
    cached map. This helps the MaterialX project use testrender for
    certain unit tests and verification. #1648 #1649
  + feat: Expose llvm groupdata size as a shadergroup attribute
    "llvm_groupdata_size". #1642
  + fix: Crash could result from uncaught exception in OpenColorIO
    when calling transformc with derivatives for color spaces that
    require OCIO.  #1646
  + fix: certain uses of fmod() in shaders could fail to generate
    LLVM code correctly, due to a missing implementation for the
    fmod(triple,float) varieties. #1643
  + build: Change snprintf formatting to satisfy some compilers.
    #1640
  + CI: Fix broken Mac ci. #1647

  * Remove unnecessary setting of locale::global. #1630
  * Batch shading: Fix bug with masked wide glosure generation.
  * Make sure ReParameter() has the same relaxed type checking
    rules as Parameter(). Before, it was stricter about type
    conversion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 16 07:05:07 UTC 2023 - Dirk M√ºller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.12.8.0:
  * Remove dependency on OptiX SDK for building core OSL with OptiX support.
    You can now build OSL with OptiX support enabled even if you don't have the
    OptiX SDK headers present at build time. But you will still need them to
    build your OptiX-based application that uses OSL for GPU rendering.
  * Batch mode: fix issue with closure keyword parameters.
  * Batch mode: fix crash when adding a default initialized closure.
  * Batch mode: Fix support for closures with array types.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 15:16:37 UTC 2022 - Stefan Br√ºns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- update to 1.12.6.2:
  For details see
  https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenShadingLanguage/releases/tag/v1.12.6.2
  * Batch shading: A fully operational "batch shading" support when
    using CPUs supporting the Intel AVX2 or AVX512 instruction set
    architectures, allows shading 8 or 16 points at a time,
    accelerated by using SIMD instructions. (Changes contributed
    by Intel.)
  * OptiX: A reasonable subset of the OSL language can run on
    NVIDIA GPUs for Cuda or OptiX-based renderers.
  * Standardized material closures: Synchronize with MaterialX on
    a minimum standard set of material closures. This is reflected
    in both the OSL spec as well as reference implementations of
    those closures in testrender.
- Remove subpackage with MaterialX shaders. These were already
  deprecated for some time, instead ones from upstream
  MaterialX project should be used.

    "main". #1431
  * Testing: Get texture3d tests operational again. #1437
  * Docs: Fix missing "errormessage" explanation for environment() and
    texture3d().
  * Build/cmake fixes: Make PROJECT_VERSION_RELEASE_TYPE and
    OSL_SUPPORTED_RELEASE be cache strings, so they can be overridden; change
    OSL_IS_SUBPROJECT to PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL (and change its sense) to match
    CMake 21+ behavior; add a TIME_COMMANDS option to help debug performance of
    the build. #1443

Wed May 13 19:11:41 UTC 2020 - Stefan Br√ºns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use the correct CMake variable to set the shader install location.
- Replace osl-pkgconfig-versions.patch with correct upstream
  0001-Fix-typo-in-the-.pc.in-files-that-botched-the-versio.patch
- Adapt to LLVM 9/10 changes defaulting to single clang-cpp library,
  add 0001-Use-single-shared-clang-cpp-library-starting-with-LL.patch
  instead of mangling CMake output.
- Dropped osl-oslimageio-soname.patch, which erroneously adds a
  version to the OpenImageIO plugin, voiding any chance for
  OIIO to find and load the plugin.
- Rename the osl.imageio package to OpenImageIO-plugin-osl, to
  better reflect its purpose, install the plugin to the default
  OpenImageIO plugin directory.
- Use python3 for the build process.
