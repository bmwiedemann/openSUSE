  <title>Standard library for OCaml</title>
  <description>Base is a standard library for OCaml. It provides a standard set of general purpose modules that are well-tested, performant, and fully-portable across any environment that can run OCaml code. Unlike other standard library projects, Base is meant to be used as a wholesale replacement of the standard library distributed with the OCaml compiler. In particular it makes different choices and doesnâ€™t re-export features that are not fully portable such as I/O, which are left to other libraries.
