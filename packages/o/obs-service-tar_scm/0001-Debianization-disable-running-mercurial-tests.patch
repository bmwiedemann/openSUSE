Subject: [PATCH] Debianization: disable running mercurial tests

This is needed to make this package build on the Ubuntu
distributions at build.opensuse.org. These distributions
provide only Ubuntu's main repository, which does not contain
the mercurial package. The mercurial package is only needed
to run mercurial tests, thus disabeling mercurial tests allows
building the package.
