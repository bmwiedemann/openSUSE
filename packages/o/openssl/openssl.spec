%description
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols with full-strength cryptography. The project is managed
by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to
communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related
documentation.
