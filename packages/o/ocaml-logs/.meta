  <title>Logging infrastructure for OCaml</title>
  <description>Logs provides a logging infrastructure for OCaml. Logging is performed on sources whose reporting level can be set independently. Log message report is decoupled from logging and is handled by a reporter.

A few optional log reporters are distributed with the base library and the API easily allows to implement your own.
