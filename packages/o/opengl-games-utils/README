This package contains various shell scripts which are intented for use by
3D games packages. These shell scripts can be used to check if direct rendering
is available before launching an OpenGL game. This package is intended for use
by other packages and is not intended for direct end user use!


Currently this package only contains one script:
opengl-game-wrapper.sh

To use this script create a link in /usr/bin gamename-wrapper[.sh] to
opengl-game-wrapper.sh, and put gamename-wrapper[.sh] in your desktop file
instead of gamename. The wrapper script will use $0 to determine gamename,
if direct rendering is available the wrapper script will execute gamename
with any parameters passed to the script, if direct rendering is not
available a userfriendly error dialog will be shown explaining that gamename
cannot run without hardware accelerated 3d, and that this is probably due to
missing Free Software support for the users card.


In the future I also plan to add an opengl-games-functions.sh file which can
be included by other wrapper scripts, the idea is to have a function in here
which will return true or false depending on if the current glx setup is a
setup which is known to work well. This function will have a list of
OpenGL renderer strings of known to work well drivers. This can then be used
by games which can take advantage of OpenGL, but will work without it too,
to determine wether or not to enable OpenGL support. The idea here is that
one might not want to enable OpenGL by default on SIS, VIA and other
low quality chipset / drivers.


Last but not least before I forget, to avoid any licensing issues I hereby
declare that all files in this package are in the Public Domain.
