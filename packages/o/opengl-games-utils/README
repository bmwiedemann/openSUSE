This package contains various shell scripts which are intented for use by
3D games packages. These shell scripts can be used to check if direct rendering
is available before launching an OpenGL game. This package is intended for use
by other packages and is not intended for direct end user use!


Currently this package contains one utility script:
opengl-game-wrapper.sh

To use this script create a link in /usr/bin gamename-wrapper[.sh] to
opengl-game-wrapper.sh, and put gamename-wrapper[.sh] in your desktop file
instead of gamename. The wrapper script will use $0 to determine gamename,
if direct rendering is available the wrapper script will execute gamename
with any parameters passed to the script, if direct rendering is not
available a userfriendly error dialog will be shown explaining that gamename
cannot run without hardware accelerated 3d, and that this is probably due to
missing Free Software support for the users card.

The utility script uses 2 functions defined in
/usr/share/opengl-games-utils/opengl-game-functions.sh
You can also use these 2 functions directly from your own scripts by
including the above file from your own shell script.

The 2 included functions are:

hasDri:
This function will return true if hardware accellerated OpenGL is available
and false if it is not. This does not say anything about the OpenGL
capabilities (nor the quality of the driver).

checkDriOK:
This functino calls hasDri, if hardware accellerated OpenGL is available
it does nothing, if it is not available it will show an error dialog and
then call exit. This is the function around which opengl-game-wrapper.sh is
build. It is provided as a "library" function so that if your game needs a
wrapper script anyways, you don't need to wrap the wrapper but instead can
call it directly from the wrapper.


Last but not least before I forget, to avoid any licensing issues I hereby
declare that all files in this package are in the Public Domain.
