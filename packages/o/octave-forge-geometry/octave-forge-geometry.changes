- Update to version 3.0.0
  * This version of the package is not backward compatible for the
    following reasons:
    +  Functions have changed their name
	 beltproblem      --> beltProblem
	 closed_path      --> closedPath
	 shapearea        --> shapeArea
	 shapecentroid    --> shapeCentroid
	 shapeplot        --> plotShape
	 shapetransform   --> transformShape
         simplifypolygon  --> simplifyPoligon
         simplifyPolyline --> simplifyPolyline
     + Functions that are in GNU Octave core since 4.0.1
	 rad2deg deg2rad
  * Added Functions:
    isAxisHandle isPolygonCCW isPolygonCW_Clipper joinPolygons polygon2patch
    orientPolygon boundedVoronoi2d drawGraphEdges clipGraph grAdjacentEdges

    recenterTransform3d transformLine3d transformVector3d intersectPolylines
    clipPolyline clipPolyline_clipper clipPolygon clipPolygon_clipper
  * Improved Functions
    + drawPolygon is more efficent when drawing polygons in cells and now it
      takes an axis handle as first argument (optional). Added demo and tests
    + intersectEdges accepts tolerance as third argument
    + polygon2patch demo fixed, missing third argument for patch.

Fri Jun 10 16:14:46 UTC 2016 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.1
  * Added Functions:
    'projPointOnPolyline': the function is added for compatibility,
    but it is just a wrapper of distancePointPolyline.
    'findClosestPoint'
    'fillPolygon'
    'rectAsPolygon'
  * Improved Functions
    'distancePointPolyline' is now updated with a spee dup of 100x.
    It also calculates the projections.

Sat May  2 20:23:50 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.0
  * Geometry 2.0.0 is not compatible with versions of octave older 
    than 4.0. Thi si due to inputParser being used in the functions
    curve2polyline, cov2ellipse and simplifypolyline. If you do not
    need this functions you should no problems using octave > 3.6.0
  * Removed functions: oc_polybol is not part of geomtry anymore.
    This function is part of the octclip package.
  * Added Functions: planePoint
  * Drop obsolete geometry-openmp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 26 16:06:43 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Split from octave-forge package, version 1.7.0
- Fix build with openmp
  * geometry-openmp.patch
