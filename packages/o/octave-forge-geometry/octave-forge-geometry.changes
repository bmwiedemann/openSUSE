Mon Feb 26 12:42:23 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use %patch -P N instead of deprecated %patchN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul  9 09:13:35 UTC 2021 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

- Add upstream patch:
  * compile-with-g++-v11.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 20 13:54:49 UTC 2020 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 4.0.0
  * As of this version, geometry does not contain any matgeom
    functionality. It contains all the extra functions that we
    have been adding to geometry, in particular matlab compatible
    functionality for the mapping package.
      It might need that you do not need geometry anymore and
    instead you need to install matgeom to get the functionality
    you were using.
  * Functions have been modified
    clipPolygon:
     - Accepts boolean operation as strings or as integer.
     - Accepts a box [xmin xmax ymin ymax] as clipping polygon.
  * Added Functions
    drawFilledPolygon

Wed Nov 27 00:32:19 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 3.0.0
  * This version of the package is not backward compatible for the
    following reasons:
    +  Functions have changed their name
	 beltproblem      --> beltProblem
	 closed_path      --> closedPath
	 shapearea        --> shapeArea
	 shapecentroid    --> shapeCentroid
	 shapeplot        --> plotShape
	 shapetransform   --> transformShape
         simplifypolygon  --> simplifyPoligon
         simplifyPolyline --> simplifyPolyline
     + Functions that are in GNU Octave core since 4.0.1
	 rad2deg deg2rad
  * Added Functions:

  * Improved Functions
    + drawPolygon is more efficent when drawing polygons in cells and now it
      takes an axis handle as first argument (optional). Added demo and tests
    + intersectEdges accepts tolerance as third argument
    + polygon2patch demo fixed, missing third argument for patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 10 16:14:46 UTC 2016 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.1.1
  * Added Functions:
    'projPointOnPolyline': the function is added for compatibility,
    but it is just a wrapper of distancePointPolyline.
    'findClosestPoint'
    'fillPolygon'
    'rectAsPolygon'
  * Improved Functions
    'distancePointPolyline' is now updated with a spee dup of 100x.
    It also calculates the projections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  2 20:23:50 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Update to version 2.0.0
  * Geometry 2.0.0 is not compatible with versions of octave older 
    than 4.0. Thi si due to inputParser being used in the functions
    curve2polyline, cov2ellipse and simplifypolyline. If you do not
    need this functions you should no problems using octave > 3.6.0
  * Removed functions: oc_polybol is not part of geomtry anymore.
    This function is part of the octclip package.
  * Added Functions: planePoint
  * Drop obsolete geometry-openmp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 26 16:06:43 UTC 2015 - dmitry_r@opensuse.org

- Split from octave-forge package, version 1.7.0
- Fix build with openmp
  * geometry-openmp.patch
