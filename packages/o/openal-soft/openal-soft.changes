- new version 1.14
    * Improved multi-threaded efficiency, relying less on a "big" mutex in favor of rw-locks and atomic operations where possible.
    * Added support for HRTF-based mixing. Stereo output only. The default built-in data set only supports 44100hz playback. See the new hrtf.txt for more information.
    * Added CMake options to cause a configuration error if the wanted backends aren't available.
    * Modified backends so that only one is used at a time (for each playback and capture), to avoid device ownership conflicts.

    * Improved reverb, which now supports the Modulation and Echo
      properties
    * The alsoft/.conf/.ini/rc drivers config option now allows unnamed
      backends to remain available, by ending the device list with a
      comma (,)
    * PulseAudio playback will try to use an output frequency and
      channel format that best matches the default sink If the sink
      device is configured for 5.1 output at 48khz, for example, OpenAL
      Soft will automatically use 5.1 output at 48khz, unless overridden
      in the config file.
    * Multi-channel sounds are now passed through the auxiliary sends
      Although they are down-mixed to mono, losing channel separation.
    * Fixed playback when creating a second context from a device
    * Added a new config option to enable real-time priority when mixing
      for certain backends (ALSA, OSS, Solaris, and DirectSound)
    * Buffers now store 32-bit float sample data internally, to retain
      32-bit sample accuracy
    * Added a new head-dampening config option, for mono and stereo
      playback This slightly filters sounds coming from behind, allowing
      for some subtle differences between front and back sound sources.
    * Added an option to allow spawning the PulseAudio server on demand
    * Support for the new AL_EXT_source_distance_model extension

    * Fixed 7.1 output
    * Fixed potential crash when setting an AL_EFFECT_NULL effect on
      an auxiliary effect slot
    * Backend libraries are now loaded and released as needed
      In particular, this allows for backends to be added and
      removed at runtime when their corresponding libraries are
      installed and uninstalled (provided support for those backends
      was compiled in). An active backend will remain available as
      long as its in use.
    * Support for multiple contexts per device
    * Fixed possible ghost references on buffers and auxiliary
      slots, if they're attached to sources that are forcibly

Sun Nov  1 10:08:38 UTC 2009 - lnussel@suse.de

- update to current git snapshot to fix problems with pulseaudio
  (bnc#551022)
- disable --as-needed for libopenal.so.0 compatibility library to
  force linking against libopenal.so.1

Thu Oct 29 11:04:51 UTC 2009 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.9.563
  * Preliminary support for the new ALC_EXT_disconnect extension.
  * Support for 32-bit float playback and capture on some backends
  * Proper support for the ALC_FREQUENCY context attribute
  * Fixed compatibility with newer PulseAudio libs.
  * Fixed parsing of the speaker layout config string.
  * Fixed buffer size issues with ALSA capture.
  * Fixed a problem where the reported number of processed buffers could be wrong.
  * Fixed possible crashes when specifying invalid device pointers.
  * Removed the backend-specific period config options, and made it a global option instead.
  * Deprecated the refresh config option for the new period_size option.
  * Better cleanup of backends when the OpenAL lib is unloaded.

Tue Jun  9 07:16:51 UTC 2009 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.8.466
  * Support for two more effects: AL_EFFECT_EAXREVERB and AL_EFFECT_ECHO
    Not all of the EAXREVERB properties will currently affect the output. More
    should be supported in the future
  * Improved reverb
  * Added a PulseAudio backend
  * Improved mixer efficiency a bit
  * Improved ALSA playback
  * Multiple auxiliary slots supported
    Default is four, which can be modified with the config file
  * Multiple auxiliary sends supported
    Default is two per source, which cannot be increased without recompilation.
    The amount can be decreased with the config file

Wed May  6 16:09:16 CEST 2009 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.7.411
  * New table-based panning algorithm, allowing the center channel to be included in the mix
  * Speaker arrangements are now configurable
  * Added a new PortAudio backend
  * Some changes to the ALSA device list
    Standard enumeration will now only list a single ALSA playback device (for "default"), and there should be no more name clashes preventing a device with the same name from being used
  * Low-pass filters now affect multi-channel sources
  * Corrections for 6.1 channel placements
  * Multi-channel sources are now re-mixed when using a different output mode
    This prevents source channels from being lost if there isn't a matching output channel (eg. 5.1 sources on stereo output)
  * Multi-channel source gains are now correctly clamped to the source's min/max gains
  * The air absorption calculation now uses the correct distance
  * The source room rolloff factor can now be set up to 10
  * Updated reverb code that better follows the reverb parameters
- add pulseaudio backend from git head and enable by default

Fri Jan  9 13:33:32 CET 2009 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.6.372
  * Channel volumes are now ramped from source position changes and when starting playback, to help prevent pops and clicks
  * The AL_DOPPLER_FACTOR source property works
  * Implemented a new Solaris backend for playback
  * The openal-info example will now print EFX information
  * More EFX compliance fixes
  * Support for non-mmap ALSA capture
  * A new low-pass filter, based on the I3DL2 specification
  * The ALSOFT_CONF environment variable may be used to specify an additional configuration file
  * A completely new reverb effect implementation
  * Improved CPU use for the DirectSound backend
