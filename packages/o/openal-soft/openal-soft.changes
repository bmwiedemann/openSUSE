Wed May 29 08:01:46 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Use more of macros for building
- Build gui config tool as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  6 11:32:59 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Trim bias from description, trim metadata duplication from
  description, trim main description repetition in lesser
  subpackages' description. Spruce up summaries. Fix SRPM group.
- Add missing Requires inside baselibs.conf.
- Remove insatisfiable Recommends. Add Provides/Conflicts
  for the move of makehrtf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 21 20:24:45 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Packaging changes:
  * Move makehrtf from the devel package to a separate package, as
    it is the only part not under LGPL (or MIT).
  * Move the remaining tools and data files to separate packages,
    to get the License tag correct, and make the data files noarch.
  * Use https in Url and Source tags.
- Update to 1.19.1
  * The changes from 1.19.0 include:
    - Implemented capture support for the SoundIO backend.
    - Fixed source buffer queues potentially not playing properly when
      a queue entry completes.
    - Fixed possible unexpected failures when generating auxiliary
      effect slots.
    - Fixed a crash with certain reverb or device settings.
    - Fixed OpenSL capture.
    - Improved output limiter response, better ensuring the sample
      amplitude is clamped for output.
  * The changes from 1.18.2 include:
    - Implemented the ALC_SOFT_device_clock extension.
    - Implemented the Pitch Shifter, Frequency Shifter, and Autowah
      effects.
    - Fixed compiling on FreeBSD systems that use freebsd-lib 9.1.
    - Fixed compiling on NetBSD.
    - Fixed the reverb effect's density scale and panning parameters.
    - Fixed use of the WASAPI backend with certain games, which caused
      odd COM initialization errors.
    - Increased the number of virtual channels for decoding Ambisonics
      to HRTF output.
    - Changed 32-bit x86 builds to use SSE2 math by default for
      performance. Build-time options are available to use just SSE1
      or x87 instead.
    - Replaced the 4-point Sinc resampler with a more efficient cubic
      resampler.
    - Renamed the MMDevAPI backend to WASAPI.
    - Added support for 24-bit, dual-ear HRTF data sets. The built-in
      data set has been updated to 24-bit.
    - Added a 24- to 48-point band-limited Sinc resampler.
    - Added an SDL2 playback backend. Disabled by default to avoid a
      dependency on SDL2.
    - Improved the performance and quality of the Chorus and Flanger
      effects.
    - Improved the efficiency of the band-limited Sinc resampler.
    - Improved the Sinc resampler's transition band to avoid
      over-attenuating higher frequencies.
    - Improved the performance of some filter operations.
    - Improved the efficiency of object ID lookups.
    - Improved the efficienty of internal voice/source synchronization.
    - Improved AL call error logging with contextualized messages.
    - Removed the reverb effect's modulation stage. Due to the lack of
      reference for its intended behavior and strength.

Tue Jun 26 06:50:08 UTC 2012 - lnussel@suse.de

- new version 1.14
    * Improved multi-threaded efficiency, relying less on a "big" mutex in favor of rw-locks and atomic operations where possible.
    * Added support for HRTF-based mixing. Stereo output only. The default built-in data set only supports 44100hz playback. See the new hrtf.txt for more information.
    * Added CMake options to cause a configuration error if the wanted backends aren't available.
    * Modified backends so that only one is used at a time (for each playback and capture), to avoid device ownership conflicts.
    * Fixed enumeration in certain backends to not list a default device, when the default device is enumerated normally anyway (eg, with DirectSound and PulseAudio).
    * Improved device naming to more closely match the names given by the backends.

    * Restored compatibility with some older PulseAudio libs.
    * Alternative buffer sizing for PulseAudio, specified using a new config option.
    * Improved buffer size calculations, to prevent drastic latency changes when certain properties (such as ALC_FREQUENCY) are modified.
    * Added capture support for the PortAudio backend.
    * Support for PortAudio under Windows.
    * Added support for the format extensions AL_EXT_MULAW, AL_EXT_MULAW_MCFORMATS, and AL_EXT_DOUBLE.

      properties
    * The alsoft/.conf/.ini/rc drivers config option now allows unnamed
      backends to remain available, by ending the device list with a
      comma (,)
    * PulseAudio playback will try to use an output frequency and
      channel format that best matches the default sink If the sink
      device is configured for 5.1 output at 48khz, for example, OpenAL
      Soft will automatically use 5.1 output at 48khz, unless overridden
      in the config file.
    * Multi-channel sounds are now passed through the auxiliary sends
      Although they are down-mixed to mono, losing channel separation.
    * Fixed playback when creating a second context from a device
    * Added a new config option to enable real-time priority when mixing
      for certain backends (ALSA, OSS, Solaris, and DirectSound)
    * Buffers now store 32-bit float sample data internally, to retain
      32-bit sample accuracy
    * Added a new head-dampening config option, for mono and stereo
      playback This slightly filters sounds coming from behind, allowing
      for some subtle differences between front and back sound sources.
    * Added an option to allow spawning the PulseAudio server on demand
    * Support for the new AL_EXT_source_distance_model extension

    * Fixed surround sound channel ordering for PulseAudio playback
    * Fixed 7.1 output
    * Fixed potential crash when setting an AL_EFFECT_NULL effect on
      an auxiliary effect slot
    * Backend libraries are now loaded and released as needed
      In particular, this allows for backends to be added and
      removed at runtime when their corresponding libraries are
      installed and uninstalled (provided support for those backends
      was compiled in). An active backend will remain available as
      long as its in use.
    * Support for multiple contexts per device
    * Fixed possible ghost references on buffers and auxiliary
      slots, if they're attached to sources that are forcibly
      deleted on context destruction

  * Improved mixer efficiency a bit
  * Improved ALSA playback
  * Multiple auxiliary slots supported
    Default is four, which can be modified with the config file

  * Speaker arrangements are now configurable

  * Low-pass filters now affect multi-channel sources
  * Corrections for 6.1 channel placements
  * Multi-channel sources are now re-mixed when using a different output mode
    This prevents source channels from being lost if there isn't a matching output channel (eg. 5.1 sources on stereo output)
  * Multi-channel source gains are now correctly clamped to the source's min/max gains
  * The air absorption calculation now uses the correct distance
  * The source room rolloff factor can now be set up to 10
  * Updated reverb code that better follows the reverb parameters
