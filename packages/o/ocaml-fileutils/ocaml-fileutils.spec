%description
This library is intended to provide a basic interface to the most
common file and filename operations.  It provides several different
filename functions: reduce, make_absolute, make_relative...  It also
enables you to manipulate real files: cp, mv, rm, touch...

It is separated into two modules: SysUtil and SysPath.  The first one
manipulates real files, the second one is made for manipulating
abstract filenames.
