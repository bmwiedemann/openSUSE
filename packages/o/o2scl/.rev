    <comment>Finally with all RPM group issues fixed

- Upgrade RPM groups; combine two find calls.
- Fix package groups: shared library -&gt; System/Libraries, devel
  package -&gt; Productivity/Scientific/Math.
- Use boost-devel instead of libboost_headers-devel where the
  latter is not available (openSUSE &lt; 1320).
- Initial package.

    <comment>- Fix URL (old link dead)
- Update to version 0.922:
  * In the table class, the set() function no longer automatically
    adds rows or columns. This prevents some behavior which was
    not intuitive for users.
  * Several tensor functions have been added, including
    tensor::swap_data(), tensor_out(), tensor::min(),
    tensor::max(), tensor::copy(), tensor::is_valid().
  * Slicing for tensor_grid objects has been improved.
  * Copy constructors for tensor and tensor_grid have been
    created.
  * A few long double integration classes have been added when
    higher accuracy is required.
  * The MCMC classes have been completely reworked, offering
    better support for OpenMP and MPI parallelism.
  * The acol command has been expanded and improved in several
    ways. Code for o2graph has been moved out and the
    documentation has been improved.
  * The conversion functions in convert_units now has a const
    version
  * The documentation has been improved everywhere.
  * A new nearest neighbor interpolation type has been added.
  * A seed bug in rng_gsl has been fixed.
  * HDF5 I/0 for table3d types now allows const references.
  * The cloud_file class is updated and simplified.
  * The prob_dens_func_amr class has been updated.
  * Some work has been done on heat capacity functions for
    particle objects.
  * The fermion_rel::calc_mu() and pair_mu() functions work better
    now with bad initial guesses.
  * The tov_solve, eos_tov, eos_cs2_const, and eos_had_rmf_hyp
    classes are improved.
- Drop o2scl-decrease-fit_fix-tolerances.patch: upstreamed.
- Add o2scl-remove-glob_wrapper-test.patch: Remove glob_wrapper()
  from misc_ts because it isn't platform independent; patch taken
  from upstream git (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#8).
