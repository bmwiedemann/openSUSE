-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 11 13:47:27 UTC 2025 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

  * Small fixes to address some security updates and problems on
    32-bit systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  9 20:30:02 UTC 2024 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 0.929:
  * Created example ex_mcmc_kde.cpp.
  * Created new steppers for mcmc_para.
  * Improved Python, multiprecision, MPFR support in several
    classes.
  * Updated classes and methods inte_kronrod_boost,
    cli::xml_to_o2(), eos_leptons, eos_leptons_multip,
    inte_double_exp_boost, ode_boost, fermion_deriv_rel,
    inte_gauss_cern, inte_adapt_cern, astep_boost, boson_rel,
    calc_utf8, funct_multip, eos_sn, lib_settings, fermi_function,
    and boson_thermo.
  * Allowed for virtual environments in py_init()
  * Updates to acol commands: table rename, table3d refine, table
    cat, table3d contours, table autocorr, table thin-mcmc.
  * Updated acol function support.
  * Updated yanic.
  * Created a new O2SCL_NO_BOOST_MULTIPRECISION ifdef for speed.
- Drop patches:
  * o2scl-disable-slow-hdf-test.patch: No longer needed as we
    disable slow running tests by passing `-DO2SCL_FAST_TEST` to
    CXXFLAGS instead.
  * o2scl-link-quadmath.patch: fixed upstream.
- Split off tests into separate multibuild flavour to avoid main
  library builds getting bogged down by long running tests and
  also to turn off python support for the test flavour to avoid
  running python based tests. This prevents a circular dependency
  between python-o2sclpy and o2scl.
- Build with ncurses support; add BuildRequires:
  pkgconfig(ncurses).
- Switch a few *-devel BuildRequires to pkgconfig based ones.
- Account for openSUSE Leap having hdf5 < 1.12 by passing
  `-DO2SCL_HDF5_PRE_1_12` to CXXFLAGS.
- Add o2scl.rpmlintrc to mask warnings for empty files installed
  as part of doc package.
- Pass `-lgomp` to linker flags to avoid undefined symbol:
  GOMP_critical_name_end when using python o2sclpy
  (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#40).
- Update URL tag to new upstream home page.
- Disable pugixml: not for end-users (gh#awsteiner/o2scl#38).
