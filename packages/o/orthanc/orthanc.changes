Fri Jun  7 06:00:51 UTC 2024 - Axel Braun <axel.braun@gmx.de>

- version 1.12.4
  * boost185.diff removed 
  * API version upgraded to 24
  * Added "MaximumPatientCount" in /system
  * Added a new "LimitToThisLevelMainDicomTags" field in the payload of 
    /patients|studies|series/instances/../reconstruct to speed up the reconstruction
    in case you just want to update the MainDicomTags of that resource level only 
    (e.g., after you have updated the "ExtraMainDicomTags" for this level)
  * The "requestedTags" GET argument is deprecated in favor of "requested-tags"
  * Added "?whole" option to "/instances/{id}/tags" to access tags stored after pixel data

  * Multitenant DICOM plugin: added support for locales.
  * Housekeeper plugin: 
    - Added an option "LimitMainDicomTagsReconstructLevel"
      (allowed values: "Patient", "Study", "Series", "Instance"). This can greatly speed
      up the housekeeper process, e.g. if you have only update the Study level ExtraMainDicomTags.
    - Fixed broken /instances/../tags route after running the Housekeeper
      after having changed the "IngestTranscoding".
  * SDK: added OrthancPluginLogMessage() as a new primitive for plugins
    to log messages. This new primitive will display the plugin name,
    the plugin file name, and the plugin line number in the logs. If
    they are not using the LOG() facilities provided by the
    OrthancFramework, plugins should now use ORTHANC_PLUGINS_LOG_INFO(),
    ORTHANC_PLUGINS_LOG_WARNING(), and ORTHANC_PLUGINS_LOG_ERROR().

    * C-Find queries:
    - In C-Find queries including "GenericGroupLength" tags, Orthanc was still
      extracting these tags from the storage although they were already ignored
      and not returned in the response.
      They are now removed from the query earlier to avoid this disk access that
      could slow down the response time. Note that this seems to happen mainly
      when the query originates from some GE devices (AWS).
    - "TimezoneOffsetFromUTC" is now ignored for matching.
  * The 0x0111 DIMSE Status is now considered as a warning instead of an error
    when received as a response to a C-Store.
    See https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/ignore-dimse-status-0x0111-when-sending-partial-duplicate-studies/4555/3
  * Removed potential PHI from the logs when Orthanc encounters an error while
    creating a ZIP archive.
  * Monitoring of stable resources now also takes into consideration the
    resource type, not only the resource identifier identifier.
  * DICOM TLS:
    - In prior versions, when "DicomTlsRemoteCertificateRequired" was set to false, Orthanc
      was still sending a client certificate request during the TLS handshake but was not
      triggering and error if the client certificate was not trusted (equivalent to the
      "--verify-peer-cert" DCMTK option). Starting with Orthanc 1.12.4, if this option is
      set to "false", Orthanc will not send a client certificate request during the TLS
      handshake anymore (equivalent to the "--ignore-peer-cert" DCMTK option).
    - When working with "DicomTlsEnabled": true and "DicomTlsRemoteCertificateRequired": false,
      Orthanc was refusing to start if no "DicomTlsTrustedCertificates" was provided.
    - New configuration options:
      - "DicomTlsMinimumProtocolVersion" to select the minimum TLS protocol version
      - "DicomTlsCiphersAccepted" to fine tune the list of accepted ciphers
  * Fixed broken /instances/../tags route after calling of
    /studies/../reconstruct after having changed the "IngestTranscoding".
  * Upgraded dependencies for static builds:
    - boost 1.85.0

Tue Sep 27 10:52:42 UTC 2022 - Axel Braun <axel.braun@gmx.de>

- version 1.11.2
  * Added support for RGBA64 images in tools/create-dicom and /preview
  * New configuration "MaximumStorageMode" to choose between recyling of
    old patients (default behavior) and rejection of new incoming data when
    the MaximumStorageSize has been reached.

    stored in a dedicated new metadata "MainDicomSequences".  This should improve
    DicomWeb QIDO-RS and avoid warnings like "Accessing Dicom tags from storage when 
    accessing series : 0040,0275".
    Main dicom sequences can now be returned in "MainDicomTags" and in "RequestedTags".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  9 09:54:25 UTC 2021 - Axel Braun <axel.braun@gmx.de>

- Version 1.9.3

* New CMake option: "ORTHANC_LUA_VERSION" to use a specific version of system-wide Lua

* "/.../{id}/metadata/{name}" and "/.../{id}/attachments/{name}/..." URIs handle the
  HTTP headers "If-Match", "If-None-Match" and "ETag" to cope with revisions
* New function in the SDK: OrthancPluginCallRestApi()
* Full refactoring of the database plugin SDK to handle multiple readers/writers,
  which notably implies the handling of retries in the case of collisions

  is enabled, a new type of attachment "dicom-until-pixel-data" is generated

Fri Sep 18 14:50:14 UTC 2020 - Axel Braun <axel.braun@gmx.de>

- Version 1.7.4
* New configuration options to enable HTTP peers identification through certificates:
  "SslVerifyPeers" and "SslTrustedClientCertificates"
* New configuration option "SyncStorageArea" to immediately commit the files onto the disk
  (through fsync()), so as to avoid discrepencies between DB and filesystem in case of hard
  shutdown of the machine running Orthanc. This slows down adding new files into Orthanc.
* Underscores are now allowed in peers/modalities symbolic names
* Fix compatibility with C-MOVE SCU requests issued by Ambra
* Fix transcoding in C-MOVE SCP, in the case where "SynchronousCMove" is "true"
* When checking DICOM allowed methods, if there are multiple modalities with the same AET, 
  differentiate them from the calling IP
* Enable the access to raw frames in Philips ELSCINT1 proprietary compression
* Support empty key passwords when using HTTP client certificates
* Fix handling of "ModalitiesInStudy" (0008,0061) in C-FIND and "/tools/find"
