README: Orthanc for openSUSE
============================

Orthanc is a RESTful DICOM server for healthcare and medical research.
This package provides the server for Orthanc (you may want to check for plugins as well)

Configuration files for Orthanc are in 
/etc/orthanc
Configuration files are in JSON format. Orthanc reads all files in the configuration folder to build up its internal setup.

We ship a template Configuration.json. In case you are using SQLite, make sure you keep the location of /var/lib/orthanc/OrthancStorage

Starting/stopping Orthanc
Orthanc comes as systemd-service. so you can start it with:
systemctl start orthanc
To stop it:
systemctl stop orthanc
To check it:
systemctl status orthanc

To enable it at system start:
systemctl enable orthanc

Once orthanc is running, you can use
http://localhost:8042
to connect.

For any 'outside connection', the use of SSL certificates is recommended!
