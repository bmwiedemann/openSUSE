-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 21 11:15:20 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.beta:
  + Orca now uses meson instead of autotools.
  + Orca no longer depends on the python3-pyatspi package; it
    accesses AT-SPI2 directly through gobject introspection.
  + Orca now has an optional dependency on the Spiel library. Please
    see "Experimental Features" in README.md for details.
  + New and Updated Features:
    - Spiel support has been added to Orca. Spiel is a new speech
      synthesis API that works with eSpeak and Piper, with other
      synthesizers planned.
  + Web:
    - Handled several issues causing Orca to jump unexpectedly to
      the top of the page.
    - Interrupt speech before presenting new line/location with
      caret nav. This should improve behavior when arrowing rapidly
      within content.
    - Fix bug causing "\ufffc" to be shown in braille instead of
      the link.
    - Eliminate (nearly all of) our text sanity-checks and hacks
      that had been in place for Firefox/Gecko bugs. Mozilla fixed
      those bugs as part of their Cache The World work. This should
      improve performance.
  + General:
    - Fix bug causing focus to be incorrectly changed when
      selection is automatically updated in a related tree. This
      can happen with email applications (e.g. incoming messages).
    - Fix bug causing us to skip certain named elements in
      StackExchange and StackOverflow.
    - Fix several terminal-related flat review issues.
    - Fix notifications in KDE not being fully presented by
      Notification Presenter.
    - Don't say "Window" when a MATE switcher window first appears.
    - Echo sentence after whitespace typed rather than punctuation
      so the presentation does not get cut off.
    - Fix bug causing Orca to speak an object from the wrong window
      in Mouse Review.
    - Listen for and present document:page-changed events.
    - Remove logic from the Event Manager that was obsoleted by the
      ability to obsolete queued events. Make remaining logic more
      performant.
    - Convert Orca from using pyatspi to using AT-SPI2 directly.
      Much code clean-up was also done in the process.
    - Miscellaneous code changes related to becoming more ready for
      Wayland.
  + Updated translations.
- Add orca-without-git.patch: allow building without git installed.
- Add meson BuildRequires: follow upstreams port to meson.
- Drop py3atspi Requires: upstream changed to
  gobject-introspection, so we have an automatic dependency on
  typelib() now.
- Add pkgconfig(gtk+-3.0) BuildRequires: dependency checked by
  meson.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 18 17:09:18 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 46.alpha:
  + The much-requested "sleep mode" has arrived! You can cause Orca
    to act as if it were not running on an as-needed, per-app basis
    with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q. This makes it much easier to use VMs in
    which another screen reader is being used as well as
    self-voicing apps.
  + Orca now has commands to present information about the system
    without having to navigate to the bar or widget that displays
    them:
    - Present CPU and memory usage (unbound, requires psutil)
    - Present battery status (unbound, requires psutil)
  + Table navigation commands now work everywhere; not just in web
    browsers and LibreOffice. In addition to the existing commands,
    the following commands have been added:
    - Orca+Shift+T: toggle table navigation (it's enabled by
      default)
    - Orca+Alt+Shift+Left/Right/Up/Down: move to the final cell in
      the specified direction.
  + Orca's outdated tutorial message feature has been removed. In
    its place is support for customized help messages which
    application and toolkit developers can provide via
    ATK/AT-SPI2's new "help text" API. At the present time, we are
    unaware of any implementations and thus have not enabled these
    new tutorial messages by default.
  + We now always use Atspi's device API for Orca commands. This
    was initially in place only for Gtk 4 apps, which do not report
    keystrokes to us for optional construction. Having addressed
    the majority of issues with this new API, we believe it is
    ready to be used for all applications and toolkits.
  + Web and Electron Apps Improvements:
    - Include DLs in list navigation and DTs in list item navigation.
    - Improve presentation of VSCode's selection containers.
    - Web: Improve performance of navigation to end of document
  + LibreOffice Bug Fix:
    - Ensure the entire word count dialog is presented when the
      dialog is shown.
  + General Improvements and Fixes:
    - Improve performance by identifying and quickly dismissing
      obsolete accessible events.
    - Improve performance by using AT-SPI2's cache for everything.
    - Fix bug causing utterances to be split up unexpectedly.
    -  Announce the has popup state even in non-web contexts.
    - Lots of code clean-up and more work to eliminate our
      dependency on pyatspi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 16 17:49:05 UTC 2024 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 45.2:
  + Web: Fix bug causing us to get stuck in menu bar during caret
    navigation.
  + General: Dump our cached information in response to
    children-changed events so that we do not present stale
    information.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      they had been defunct/invalid before.
    - Fix bug causing rewind and fast-forward in SayAll to fail.
    - Fix chattiness issue in mate-panel.
    - Only examine descriptions by default in isSameObject for Gtk
      apps for performance reasons.
    - Use AXObject.is_dead instead of the script utility for
      performance reasons.
    - Revert "Don't let brlapi crash us". This change was a
      workaround put in place to give distros enough time to get
      the fixed brltty, but it had a slight performance impact if
      braille was enabled but not being used.
    - Stop using deprecated Gtk API in the accessible actions menu.
  + Updated translations.

    - Fix presentation of Calc selected cells
    - Fix the "screen reader on" message getting cut off

    dialogs from "jump to" to "activate"
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug  8 08:07:38 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 45.alpha:
  + Object Navigator: This allows the user to navigate through a
    hierarchy of UI objects. Bindings:
    - Ctrl+Orca+Up/Down for navigating between parent/child
    - Ctrl+Orca+Left/Right for navigating among siblings
    - Ctrl+Orca+Return for performing a click
    - Ctrl+Orca+S to toggle the simplification of the object
      hierarchy
  + Flat Review can now by restricted to the current object of
    interest to eliminate "noise" from irrelevant objects. Binding:
    Currently unbound
  + Flat Review now has a command that displays the entire contents
    being reviewed in an editable text view, making it easier to
    copy and paste the contents of terminals, dialogs, etc.
    Binding: Currently unbound
  + Action Presenter: A popup menu for performing accessible
    actions on an object, such as click, expand/collapse, press.
    This should make it easier to interact with applications with
    poor keyboard navigability. Binding: Orca+Shift+A
  + The Notification List feature was re-written. It now uses an
    actual Gtk list rather than an off-screen one. The review
    announcements now include a timestamp and the dialog allows you
    to clear the history.
  + Preferences Dialog and Shortcuts List are now grouped based on
    feature, making it far easier to discover and bind/rebind
    commands of interest.
  + The Structural Navigation command to navigate among form fields
    was remapped from Orca+Tab/Orca+Shift+Tab to F/Shift+F. A new
    command was also added to navigate among iframes, which is
    currently unbound.
  + Added a command to present the default button. Binding: Orca+E.
  + Modify Orca's left-click functionality to prefer actions which
    are associated with performing a left click (e.g. click, press,
    jump, open) and only attempt to synthesize a click as a last
    resort.
  + Added the ability to temporarily suspend registration for
    accessibility events which can greatly improve performance at
    times event floods are likely, such as window
    creation/destruction and activation/deactivation.
  + Started preferring AtspiCollection over child iteration to
    locate descendants in the accessibility tree. The performance
    improvement can be up to 10 times faster. We will continue
    making changes in this area between now and the stable release.
  + Started relying on speech-dispatcher for character presentation
    rather than our own character names dictionary, which we were
    not always using. This should cause Orca to always speak the
    character name in the same way.
  + Interrupt speech conditionally on focus changes. This is needed
    for Gtk 4 on Wayland because we currently do not get
    notifications for input events, which had been our most
    reliable hint to interrupt speech. The heuristics to identify
    when we should not interrupt speech are still being refined,
    but hopefully this will make the user experience a bit more
    tolerable until a solution is agreed upon and implemented. See
    https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/1046 for
    more information.
  + A number of improvements to reduce some lagginess and
    chattiness in certain web apps.
  + Added logic to filter out windows which claim to be active but
    really aren't, including descendants of mutter-x11-frames, the
    desktop frame of some window environments, and certain Electron
    apps.
  + Updated translations.

  the new accessibility stack. We could depend on pyatspi (which is
  a virtual package that is provided by both python-atspi and

  know what to do for the build.

  + General
    - bgo#400729 - Orca should provide support for general audio.

      to remove the custom brl module and move directly to the

      handle BrlAPI commands much better.
    - bgo#581532 - Remove brl module.  Orca now uses the BrlAPI
      python bindings.
    - bgo#582028 - Character pronunciations are not used when

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  5 19:53:55 CEST 2009 - vuntz@novell.com

- Update to version 2.27.1:
  + General:
    - Much work to handle the transition from subversion to git.
    - Updated script writer's guide -- the document lives in
      docs/doc-set/internals.html.
    - Add setting to disable the pyatspi GIL idle handler:
      useGILIdleHandler.  This change is made in response to
      bgo#576954 where it appears as though the GIL idle handler in
      pyatspi is causing consumers of pyatspi (e.g., Orca and
      accerciser) to start consuming 100% of a CPU when the machine
      is idle.  We're pretty sure the GIL handler is not necessary,
      so this change gets rid of it for the 2.27.1 development
      build of Orca.  If we see that users notice strange lock ups,
      however, we may need to change things back.
    - Adjust debug utilities to print to console and debug log.
    - bgo#570952 - Orca should be able to run with AT-SPI/D-Bus.

    - bgo#576438 - Provide state change information for radio
      buttons that require you to press space to select them.
    - bgo#577239 - Cannot navigate by line through multi-line HTML
      list items in Firefox/Thunderbird when arrowToLineBeginning
      is False.
    - bgo#577330 - Detect whether speech dispatcher is installed or
      not.
    - bgo#577977 - provide speech feedback for "repeat last find"
      in Gedit.
    - bgo#577979 - Pressing Down Arrow from the middle of a
      multi-line HTML list item initially moves to the beginning of
      the line when arrowToLineBeginning is False.
    - bgo#580423 - Remove deprecated libgnomeui dependency. Use
      DBus org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout instead of
      gnome.ui.master_client().request_save.
    - bgo#580329 - Use show_uri() to display help window.
  + OpenOffice:
    - bgo#577245 - Present paragraph-style information in
