- Update to version 1.10.7:
  * SECURITY ADVISORIES:
    This release contains fixes for some security advisories
    related to previous releases in this series.
    - tofu init in OpenTofu v1.10.6 and earlier could potentially
      use unbounded memory if there is a direct or indirect
      dependency on a maliciously-crafted module package
      distributed as a "tar" archive.
      This would require the attacker to coerce a root module
      author to depend (directly or indirectly) on a module package
      they control, using the HTTP, Amazon S3, or Google Cloud
      Storage source types to refer to a tar archive.
      This release incorporates the upstream fixes for
      CVE-2025-58183.
    - When making requests to HTTPS servers, OpenTofu v1.10.6 and
      earlier could potentially use unbounded memory or crash with
      a "panic" error if TLS verification involves an
      excessively-long certificate chain or a chain including DSA
      public keys.
      This affected all outgoing HTTPS requests made by OpenTofu
      itself, including requests to HTTPS-based state storage
      backends, module registries, and provider registries. For
      example, an attacker could coerce a root module author to
      depend (directly or indirectly) on a module they control
      which then refers to a module or provider from an
      attacker-controlled registry. That mode of attack would cause
      failures in tofu init, at module or provider installation
      time.
      Provider plugins contain their own HTTPS client code, which
      may have similar problems. OpenTofu v1.10.7 cannot address
      similar problems within provider plugins, and so we recommend
      checking for similar advisories and fixes in the provider
      plugins you use.
      This release incorporates upstream fixes for CVE-2025-58185,
      CVE-2025-58187, and CVE-2025-58188.
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix crash in tofu test when using deprecated outputs (#3249)
    - Fix missing provider functions when parentheses are used
      (#3402)
    - for_each inside dynamic blocks can now call provider-defined
      functions. (#3429)

Thu Sep 18 05:28:52 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.6:
  * UPGRADE NOTES:
    - Upgrade go from 1.24.4 to 1.24.6 to fix GO-2025-3849 (3127)
    - Upgrade github.com/openbao/openbao/api/v2 from 2.1.0 to 2.3.0
      to fix GO-2025-3783 (3134)
      - The upgrade is necessary to silence the security scanner
        and does not affect the actual state encryption provided by
        OpenBao.
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Variables with validation no longer interfere with the
      destroy process (#3131)
    - Fixed crash when processing multiple deprecated marks on a
      complex object (#3105)
    - When OpenTelemetry encounters errors, log it at the warning
      level instead of panic (#3235)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 03 11:30:39 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.5:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fixed issue where usage of TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR could result
      in unexpected lock contention errors (#3090)
      NOTE: It is still highly recommended to have valid
      .terraform.lock.hcl files in projects using
      TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 01 12:14:02 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.4:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fixed crash where sensitive set values used in for_each could
      cause a panic. (#3070)

      calls in test. (#3068)
    - Reduced calls to ListKeys in azure backend (for rate
      limiting). (#3083)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 16 06:21:22 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.3:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - OpenTofu will no longer crash in a rare case where a
      dynamically-invalid expression has its error suppressed by
      try or can and then that expression becomes relevant for
      deciding whether to report a "change outside of OpenTofu" in
      the human-oriented plan diff. (#2988)
    - Ensure provider downloads into temp are cleaned up correctly
      on windows. (#2843)
    - Correctly handle structural typed attributes during test
      provider mocking. (#2994)
    - Fix erroneous detection of changes with sensitive resource
      attributes. (#3024)

- Update to version 1.10.2:
  * S3 backend now correctly sends the x-amz-server-side-encryption
    header for the lockfile. (#2870)
  * A provider source address explicitly using the hostname
    registry.terraform.io will no longer cause errors related to a
    corresponding provider on registry.opentofu.org when executing
    workflow commands like plan and apply. (#2979)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 04:49:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.1:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix TF_APPEND_USER_AGENT handling in the S3 remote state
      backend. (#2955)
  * OTHER CHANGES:
    - OpenTofu is now built with Go 1.24.4, which should clear some
      false-positive indirect security advisories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 25 05:02:13 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.10.0:
  We're thrilled to announce the release of OpenTofu 1.10.0, our
  most comprehensive update yet! This release represents months of
  dedicated work from our community, introducing some fantastic
  features that will improve how OpenTofu users manage and
  distribute infrastructure as code.
  Full changelog:
  https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/v1.10/CHANGELOG.md
  * Highlights
    This release cycle introduces major new capabilities and
    integrations:
    - OCI Registry Support
      Full integration with OCI registries for both provider and
      module distribution, valuable for organizations with private
      infrastructure-as-code components, air-gapped environments,
      or enhanced security requirements.
      For more information, refer to Module Packages in OCI
      Registries and Provider Mirrors in OCI Registries.
      https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/oci_registries/module-package/
      https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/oci_registries/provider-mirror/
    - Native S3 Locking
      Simplify your infrastructure by using S3's conditional writes
      capability for state locking, eliminating the need for a
      separate DynamoDB table.
    - OpenTelemetry Tracing
      Gain insights into OpenTofu operations with experimental
      OpenTelemetry tracing, completely local and under your
      control.
    - Resource Management with Target Files
      Manage complex deployments more easily with the new
      -target-file and -exclude-file options, allowing
      version-controlled resource targeting patterns.
    Code examples can be found here:
    https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/tag/v1.10.0
  * Compatibility Notes
    - Linux: Requires kernel version 3.2 or later
    - macOS: Requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later
    - The ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu image is no longer supported as
      a base image
    - Windows: Symbolic links and junctions are now handled
      differently
    - The PostgreSQL backend in OpenTofu 1.10 should not be used
      alongside older versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 25 06:50:58 UTC 2025 - Johannes Kastl <opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de>

- Update to version 1.9.1:
  * BUG FIXES:
    - Provider used in import is correctly identified. (#2336)
    - plantimestamp() now returns unknown value during validation
      (#2397)
    - Syntax error in the required_providers block does not panic
      anymore, but yields "syntax error" (2344)
    - Fix the error message when default value of a complex
      variable is containing a wrong type (2394)
    - Changing Go version to 1.22.11 in order to fix CVE-2024-45336
      and CVE-2024-45341 (#2438)
    - Fix the way OpenTofu downloads a module that is sourced from
      a GitHub branch containing slashes in the name. (2396)
    - Changing Go version to 1.22.12 in order to fix CVE-2025-22866
      and CVE-2024-45341 (#2438)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 10 05:54:48 UTC 2025 - opensuse_buildservice@ojkastl.de

- Update to version 1.9.0:
  We're proud to announce that OpenTofu 1.9.0 is now officially
  out! This release includes a lot of major and minor new features,
  as well as a ton of community contributions!
  The highlights are:
  * for_each in provider configuration blocks: An alternate (aka
    "aliased") provider configuration can now have multiple
    dynamically-chosen instances using the for_each argument:

    provider "aws" {
      alias    = "by_region"
      for_each = var.aws_regions

      region = each.key
    }

    Each instance of a resource can also potentially select a
    different instance of the associated provider configuration,
    making it easier to declare infrastructure that ought to be
    duplicated for each region.
  * -exclude planning option: similar to -target, this allows
    operators to tell OpenTofu to work on only a subset of the
    objects declared in the configuration or tracked in the state.

      tofu plan -exclude=kubernetes_manifest.crds

    While -target specifies the objects to include and skips
    everything not needed for the selected objects, -exclude
    instead specifies objects to skip. OpenTofu will exclude the
    selected objects and everything that depends on them.

  Please take the above for a spin and let us know your feedback!
  For all the features, see the detailed changelog.
