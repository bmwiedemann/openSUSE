%description
Fork of Terraform

OpenTofu is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure
safely and efficiently. OpenTofu can manage existing and popular service
providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of OpenTofu are:
- Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is described using a high-level
  configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be
  versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure
  can be shared and re-used.
- Execution Plans: OpenTofu has a "planning" step where it generates an
  execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTofu will do when you call
  apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTofu manipulates
  infrastructure.
- Resource Graph: OpenTofu builds a graph of all your resources, and
  parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources.
  Because of this, OpenTofu builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and
  operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
- Change Automation: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure
  with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan
  and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTofu will change and in what
  order, avoiding many possible human errors.
