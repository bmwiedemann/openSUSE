  <title>System-Wide Profiler for Linux Systems</title>
  <description>OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of
profiling all running code at low overhead. OProfile is released under
the GNU GPL.

It consists of a kernel module and a daemon for collecting sample data,
and several post-profiling tools for turning data into information.

OProfile leverages the CPU hardware performance counters to enable
profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which can also
be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled: hardware
and software interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel, shared
libraries, and applications (the only exception being the oprofile
interrupt handler itself).

OProfile is currently in alpha status; however it has proven stable
over a large number of differing configurations. As always, there is no
warranty.

This is the package containing the userspace tools.</description>
