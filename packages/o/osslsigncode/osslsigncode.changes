- update to 2.3.0:
  * This release fixes several critical memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    A malicious attacker could create a file, which, when processed with
    osslsigncode, triggers arbitrary code execution. Any previous version
    of osslsigncode should be immediately upgraded if the tool is used for
    processing of untrusted files.
  * fixed non-interactive PVK (MSBLOB) key decryption
  * added a bash completion script
  * added CA bundle path auto-detection
  * CAT files support (thanks to James McKenzie)
  * MSI support rewritten without libgsf dependency, which allows
  * for handling of all the needed MSI metadata, such as dates
  * "-untrusted" option renamed to "-TSA-CAfile"
  * "-CRLuntrusted" option renamed to "-TSA-CRLfile"
  * numerous bug fixes and improvements
  * certificate chain verification support
  * timestamp verification support
  * CRL verification support ("-CRLfile" option)
  * improved CAB signature support
  * nested signatures support
  * user-specified signing time ("-st" option) by vszakats
  * added more tests
  * fixed numerous bugs
  * dropped OpenSSL 1.1.0 support 
  * orphaned project adopted by Michał Trojnara
  * ported to OpenSSL 1.1.x
  * ported to SoftHSM2
  * add support for pkcs11-based hardware tokens
  * improved error reporting of timestamping errors
