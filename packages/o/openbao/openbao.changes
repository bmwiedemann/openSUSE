- Update to version 2.1.0:
  * Note:
    - This release does not ship with the UI enabled. The UI will
      be available in the future. #129
    - OpenBao does not provide support for Vault Enterprise
      features. If there is an enterprise feature you would like to
      see added to the project, please open a feature request.
    - OpenBao is fully API compatible with Vault 1.14.9, and seal
      compatible with the plugins the project supports. Plugin
      support for OpenBao can be found here.
  * New Features:
    - Remove Mount Table Limits: Using transactional storage, we've
      split the
    - auth and secret mount tables into separate storage entires,
      removing the
    - requirement that the entire table fit into a single storage
      entry limited by
    - max_entry_size. This allows potentially hundreds of thousands
      of mounts on
    - a single scaled-up server. [GH-622]
    - Transactional Storage: Plugin developers can now take
      advantage of safe
    - storage modification APIs when the underlying physical
      storage supports
    - them. The physical.TransactionalBackend and
      logical.TransactionalStorage
    - types allow developers to begin read-only and writable
      transactions,
    - committing or rolling back the desired changes. [GH-292]
    - Transit: Support PKI CSR and certificate storage alongside
      key material. This allows callers to securely create keys and
      submit requests for certificates without the key material
      leaving Transit. Storage of the certificate on the key avoids
      the need for an additional K/V mount. Rotation of this
      certificate and its chain is also supported. [GH-536]
    - auth/oidc: Add a new callback_mode role option value device
      to use the oidc device flow instead of a callback, add a new
      poll_interval role option to control how often to poll for a
      response, and add a new callbackmode=device option to the
      oidc login method in the cli. [GH-319]
    - auth/oidc: Add new callback_mode=direct role option to cause
      the oidc callback to be direct to the server instead of the
      client, and add a callbackmode=direct option to the oidc
      login method in the cli. [GH-318]
    - physical/postgres: Reintroduce Postgres database for OpenBao
      storage, implementing paginated list support. This feature is
      currently in preview and breaking changes may occur. [GH-467]
