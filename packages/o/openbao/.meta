  <description>OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute                                                                                                                                                                                                           
sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. The OpenBao community                                                                                                                                                                                                          
intends to provide this software under an OSI-approved open-source license, led                                                                                                                                                                                                          
by a community run under open governance principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented                                                                                                                                                                                                            
architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is                                                                                                                                                                                                          
already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure                                                                                                                                                                                                              
storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
solution. This is where OpenBao steps in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The key features of OpenBao are:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
- Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in OpenBao.                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  OpenBao encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage,                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
  OpenBao can write to disk, Consul, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
- Dynamic Secrets: OpenBao can generate secrets on-demand for some systems,                                                                                                                                                                                                              
  such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  access an S3 bucket, it asks OpenBao for credentials, and OpenBao will generate                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic                                                                                                                                                                                                          
  secrets, OpenBao will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
- Data Encryption: OpenBao can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
  This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  design their own encryption methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
- Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in OpenBao have a lease associated with                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  them. At the end of the lease, OpenBao will automatically revoke that secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                          
  Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
- Revocation: OpenBao has built-in support for secret revocation. OpenBao can                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example, all                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case
