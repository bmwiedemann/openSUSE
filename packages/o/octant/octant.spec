%description
Octant is a tool for developers to understand how applications run on a Kubernetes cluster.
It aims to be part of the developer's toolkit for gaining insight and approaching complexity found in Kubernetes.
Octant offers a combination of introspective tooling, cluster navigation, and object management along with a plugin system to further extend its capabilities.
It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.
