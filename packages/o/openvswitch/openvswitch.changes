- Version bump to 2.10.0. Some of the changes are:
  * ovs-vswitchd and utilities now support DNS names in OpenFlow and
    OVSDB remotes.
  * ovs-vswitchd:
    - New options --l7 and --l7-len to "ofproto/trace" command.
    - Previous versions gave OpenFlow tables default names of the form
      "table#".  These are not helpful names for the purpose of accepting
      and displaying table names, so now tables by default have no names.
    - The "null" interface type, deprecated since 2013, has been removed.
    - Add minimum network namespace support for Linux.
    - New command "lacp/show-stats"
  * ovs-ofctl:
    - ovs-ofctl now accepts and display table names in place of numbers.  By
      default it always accepts names and in interactive use it displays them;
      use --names or --no-names to override.  See ovs-ofctl(8) for details.
  * ovs-vsctl: New commands "add-bond-iface" and "del-bond-iface".
  * ovs-dpctl:
    - New commands "ct-set-limits", "ct-del-limits", and "ct-get-limits".
  * OpenFlow:
    - OFPT_ROLE_STATUS is now available in OpenFlow 1.3.

    - New OpenFlow 1.0 extensions for group support.
    - Default selection method for select groups is now dp_hash with improved
      accuracy.
  * ovn:
    - Implemented icmp4/icmp6/tcp_reset actions in order to drop the packet
      and reply with a RST for TCP or ICMPv4/ICMPv6 unreachable message for
      other IPv4/IPv6-based protocols whenever a reject ACL rule is hit.
    - ACL match conditions can now match on Port_Groups as well as address
      sets that are automatically generated by Port_Groups.  ACLs can be
      applied directly to Port_Groups as well.
    - ovn-nbctl can now run as a daemon (long-lived, background process).
      See ovn-nbctl(8) for details.
  * DPDK:
    - New 'check-dpdk' Makefile target to run a new system testsuite.
      See Testing topic for the details.
    - Add LSC interrupt support for DPDK physical devices.

    - Detailed PMD performance metrics available with new command
      ovs-appctl dpif-netdev/pmd-perf-show
    - Supervision of PMD performance metrics and logging of suspicious
      iterations
    - Add signature match cache (SMC) as experimental feature. When turned on,
      it improves throughput when traffic has many more flows than EMC size.
  * ERSPAN:
    - Implemented ERSPAN protocol (draft-foschiano-erspan-00.txt) for
      both kernel datapath and userspace datapath.
    - Added port-based and flow-based ERSPAN tunnel port support, added
      OpenFlow rules matching ERSPAN fields. See ovs-fields(7).

  * OpenFlow:
    - ct_clear action is now backed by kernel datapath. Support is probed for
      when OVS starts.

Wed Dec  6 14:00:55 UTC 2017 - mchandras@suse.de

- Fix documentation installation. It's best to install everything to
  %buildroot and then remove the files we don't need instead of the
  other way around since some files need to be present in the source
  directory for the testsuite to run (bsc#1076284)

- Version bump to 2.8.0 (fate#323334, bsc#1050700). Some of the changes are:
  * ovs-ofctl can now accept and display port names in place of numbers.  By
    default it always accepts names and in interactive use it displays them;
    use --names or --no-names to override.  See ovs-ofctl(8) for details.
  * "ovs-ofctl dump-flows" now accepts --no-stats to omit flow statistics.
  * New ovs-dpctl command "ct-stats-show" to show connection tracking stats.
  * DPDK log messages redirected to OVS logging subsystem.
    Log level can be changed in a usual OVS way using
    'ovs-appctl vlog' commands for 'dpdk' module. Lower bound
    still can be configured via extra arguments for DPDK EAL.
  * dpdkvhostuser ports are marked as deprecated.  They will be removed
    in an upcoming release.
  * Support for DPDK v17.05.1.
  * New support for multiple VLANs (802.1ad or "QinQ"), including a new
    "dot1q-tunnel" port VLAN mode.
  * Added NAT support for userspace datapath.
  * Added FTP and TFTP support with NAT for userspace datapath.
  * Experimental NSH (Network Service Header) support in userspace datapath.
  * Tracing with ofproto/trace now traces through recirculation.
  * New support for role-based access control (see ovsdb-server(1)).
  * New commands 'stp/show' and 'rstp/show' (see ovs-vswitchd(8)).
  * All features required by OpenFlow 1.4 are now implemented, so
    ovs-vswitchd now enables OpenFlow 1.4 by default (in addition to
    OpenFlow 1.0 to 1.3).
  * Increased support for OpenFlow 1.6 (draft).
  * Bundles now support hashing by just nw_src or nw_dst.
  * The "learn" action now supports a "limit" option (see ovs-ofctl(8)).
  * The port status bit OFPPS_LIVE now reflects link aliveness.
  * OpenFlow 1.5 packet-out is now supported.
  * Support for OpenFlow 1.5 field packet_type and packet-type-aware
    pipeline (PTAP).
  * Added generic encap and decap actions (EXT-382).
    First supported use case is encap/decap for Ethernet.
  * Added NSH (Network Service Header) support in userspace
    Used generic encap and decap actions to implement encapsulation and
    decapsulation of NSH header.
    IETF NSH draft - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sfc-nsh/
  * ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server run as non-root users by default.
  * Add --cleanup option to command 'ovs-appctl exit' (see ovs-vswitchd(8)).
  * Use new tunnel port option "packet_type" to configure L2 vs. L3.
  * In conjunction with PTAP tunnel ports can handle a mix of L2 and L3
    payload.
  * New vxlan tunnel extension "gpe" to support VXLAN-GPE tunnels.
  * New support for non-Ethernet (L3) payloads in GRE and VXLAN-GPE.
  * Add experimental support for hardware offloading
  * HW offloading is disabled by default.
  * HW offloading is done through the TC interface.
  * The next major version of OVS will introduce a change in the
    conntrack API.  Conntrack state is only available to the processing
    path that follows the "recirc_table" argument of the ct() action.
    Starting in OVS 2.9, this state will be cleared for the current
    processing path whenever ct() is called.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 28 09:24:48 UTC 2017 - mchandras@suse.de

- Version bump to 2.7.0 (fate#321541). Some of the changes are:
  * Utilities and daemons that support SSL now allow protocols and
    ciphers to be configured with --ssl-protocols and --ssl-ciphers.
  * OVN:
    - QoS is now implemented via egress shaping rather than ingress policing.
    - DSCP marking is now supported, via the new northbound QoS table.
    - IPAM now supports fixed MAC addresses.
    - Support for source IP address based routing.
    - ovn-trace:
      * New --ovs option to also print OpenFlow flows.
      * put_dhcp_opts and put_dhcp_optsv6 actions may now be traced.
    - Support for managing SSL and remote connection configuration in
      northbound and southbound databases.
  * Fixed regression in table stats maintenance introduced in OVS
    2.3.0, wherein the number of OpenFlow table hits and misses was
    not accurate.
  * OpenFlow:
    - OFPT_PACKET_OUT messages are now supported in bundles.
    - A new "selection_method=dp_hash" type for OpenFlow select group
      bucket selection that uses the datapath computed 5-tuple hash
      without making datapath flows match the 5-tuple fields, which
      is useful for more efficient load balancing, for example.  This
      uses the Netronome extension to OpenFlow 1.5+ that allows
      control over the OpenFlow select groups selection method.  See
      "selection_method" and related options in ovs-ofctl(8) for
      details.
    - The "sample" action now supports "ingress" and "egress" options.
    - The "ct" action now supports the TFTP ALG where support is available.
    - New actions "clone" and "ct_clear".
  * ovs-ofctl:
    - 'bundle' command now supports packet-out messages.
    - New syntax for 'ovs-ofctl packet-out' command, which uses the
      same string parser as the 'bundle' command.  The old 'packet-out'
      syntax is deprecated and will be removed in a later OVS
      release.
    - New unixctl "ofctl/packet-out" command, which can be used to
      instruct a flow monitor to issue OpenFlow packet-out messages.
  * ovsdb-server:
    - Remote connections can now be made read-only (see ovsdb-server(1)).
  * DPDK:
    - Support for DPDK v16.11.
    - Support for rx checksum offload. Refer DPDK HOWTO for details.
    - Port Hotplug is now supported.
    - DPDK physical ports can now have arbitrary names. The PCI address of
      the device must be set using the 'dpdk-devargs' option. Compatibility
      with the old dpdk<portid> naming scheme is broken, and as such a
      device will not be available for use until a valid dpdk-devargs is
      specified.
    - Virtual DPDK Poll Mode Driver (vdev PMD) support.
  * For the complete list of changes, please see:
    - http://openvswitch.org/releases/NEWS-2.7.0
- Add patch to fix DPDK configuration migration for < 2.6 installations
  * 0001-utilities-Add-script-to-support-DPDK-option-migratio.patch
- Rework spec file
  * Enable DPDK by default and drop openvswitch-dpdk* packages. DPDK is only
    enabled on supported architectures though.
    - Remove openvswitch-dpdk.changes
    - Remove openvswitch-dpdk.spec
    - Remove pre_checkin.sh
  * Merge openvswitch and openvswitch-switch into a single package since there
    was no compelling reason to keep the switch functionality in a separate
    subpackage.
  * Split OVN package to ovn-common, ovn-central, ovn-docker, ovn-host and
    ovn-controller similar to the Debian and RedHat packages.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 25 16:36:40 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Relax the DPDK dependency a bit so we can support stable and
  possibly new minor releases as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 21 11:53:00 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Do not restart the openvswitch service after a package update.
  Restarting the systemd service may break connectivity so let the
  user decide when it is the best time for such an action. (bsc#1002734)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov  3 10:48:32 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Version bump to 2.6.1. Some of the changes are:
  * ovn: Do not reply to ARP or ND NS for a VM's own IP address.
  * ovs-ofctl: Tolerate differences in IPv6 formatting.
  * netdev-linux: double tagged packets should use 0x88a8
  * expr: Fix abort when simplifying "x != 0/0".
  * dpif-netdev: Fix crash in dpif_netdev_execute().
  * ovn-controller: Container can have connection to a hosting VM.
  * stream-ssl: Fix memory leak on error path.
  * Other bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 08:26:10 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Version bump to 2.6.0. Some of the changes are:
  * First supported release of OVN.  See ovn-architecture(7) for more
    details.
  * ovsdb-server:
     - New "monitor_cond" "monitor_cond_update" and "update2" extensions to
       RFC 7047.
   * OpenFlow:
     - OpenFlow 1.3+ bundles now expire after 10 seconds since the
       last time the bundle was either opened, modified, or closed.
     - OpenFlow 1.3 Extension 230, adding OpenFlow Bundles support, is
       now implemented.
     - OpenFlow 1.3+ bundles are now supported for group mods as well as
       flow mods and port mods.  Both 'atomic' and 'ordered' bundle
       flags are supported for group mods as well as flow mods.
     - Internal OpenFlow rule representation for load and set-field
       actions is now much more memory efficient.  For a complex flow
       table this can reduce rule memory consumption by 40%.
     - Bundles are now much more memory efficient than in OVS 2.5.
       Together with memory efficiency improvements in OpenFlow rule
       representation, the peak OVS resident memory use during a
       bundle commit for large complex set of flow mods can be only
       25% of that in OVS 2.5 (4x lower).
     - OpenFlow 1.1+ OFPT_QUEUE_GET_CONFIG_REQUEST now supports OFPP_ANY.
     - OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPMP_QUEUE_DESC is now supported.
     - OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPT_TABLE_STATUS is now supported.
     - New property-based packet-in message format NXT_PACKET_IN2 with support
       for arbitrary user-provided data and for serializing flow table
       traversal into a continuation for later resumption.
     - New extension message NXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG2 to allow OpenFlow 1.4-like
       control over asynchronous messages in earlier versions of OpenFlow.

  required by the Factory review tools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 29 15:17:07 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Remove the ?_with_dpdk macro usage since this is not being set
  without explicitly passing --with/--without during an OBS build.
  This reverts back to using the %{with dpdk} style which is set
  automatically based on %bcond_with* macros (bsc#989335).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 28 13:21:12 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Fix subpackage dependencies to not require the non-existent python
  DPDK subpackages (bsc#986835). We do not provide DPDK versions of
  the python bindings so nothing should depend on these subpackages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 22 15:07:01 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update rpm groups, acronym forms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 21 14:10:15 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Multiple fixes for the openvswitch-dpdk package (bsc#985878)
  * Rename main package name to openvswitch-dpdk
  * Do not build the python and kmp packages since they do not
    depend on the DPDK capabilities
  * Remove the open_virtual_switch capability. The
    openvswitch-common will be used by reverse dependencies to
    require either of the OvS packages.
  * Provide virtual capabilities for all DPDK subpackages.
  * Fix the dependencies in the python package to require either
    of the OvS packages.
  * Suggest the kmp package only if it's actually provided.
  * Small cleanups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 27 13:49:15 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Add %check directive to run the openvswitch testsuite on demand.
  The openvswitch contains hundreds of tests covering simple and
  complex openvswitch configuration so it's beneficial to run them
  during package builds. However, running the testsuite is not enabled
  by default. Also add the following upstream patch:
  * 0001-Remove-broken-pipe-warning-logs-from-ovsdb-server.lo.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 26 15:40:04 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

  * Apply the following changes to the openvswitch.spec file
    - Add support for building with DPDK capabilities
    - Add conflicts between the two packages.
    - Add new 'open_virtual_switch-*' capabilities for openvswitch,
      openvswitch-switch, openvswitch-test packages which can be used
      by reverse dependencies to select between the two openvswitch
      implementations.
  * Add pre_checkin.sh to generate the openvswitch_dpdk.spec file
    based on the openvswitch.spec one.
  * Add upstream openvswitch-2.5.0-detect-dpdk-installation.patch
    patch to detect and link against a DPDK installation.

Thu May  5 09:00:26 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Multiple spec file and package fixes.
  * Drop obsolete log-check-module-loop.patch patch.
  * Drop conditional code for older openSUSE releases. This also removes
    all of the sysvinit files which were pulled in when the package was
    originally developed.
  * Drop support for building the GUI. The GUI code has been removed in
    7868fbc6c97c2 ("ovsdbmonitor: Remove.") upstream commit and it does
    not exist since v2.2.0 so drop the code in the spec file.
  * Use the upstream systemd service files for the OVN components instead
    of maintaining our own downstream.
  * Drop the unofficial ipsec support. It hasn't been enabled in years.
  * Drop support for building the upstream kernel module since it's being
    shipped with the kernel package in latest releases. Restore the
    %bcond_with kmp to make it easier to build the external kernel module
    if needed.
  * Fix some suse-missing-rclink rpmlint warnings for the ovn subpackage
  * Base our service unit to the upstream one.
  * Stop silently enabling the GRE protocol in iptables by default.
  * Install the upstream sysconfig file to pass more information to the
    openvswitch service unit.
  * Use make install instead of %makeinstall
  * Drop brcompat leftovers.
  * spec-cleaner fixes

- address dimstars concerns

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 18:06:40 UTC 2016 - mchandras@suse.de

- Prevent systemd from autogenerating a service file for
  openvswitch-switch which conflicts with the opevswitch
  one. (bsc#966762)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 10:20:02 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- Add missing %defattr to ovn files section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  8 13:16:03 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- Add additional install requirements for python-openvswitch-test
  package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  4 14:38:16 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- Add support for building both 2.4.0 and 2.5.0 from the same spec
  file. Needed to fix SLE11 builds as OVS-2.5.0 no longer supports
  python < 2.7. SLE11 SP3 and SP4 use python 2.6.
- Added: openvswitch-2.4.0.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  3 13:47:04 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- New upstream version 2.5.0 (LTS)
  - Dropped support for Python older than version 2.7.  As a consequence,
    using Open vSwitch 2.5 or later on XenServer 6.5 or earlier (which
    have Python 2.4) requires first installing Python 2.7.
  - OpenFlow:
    * Group chaining (where one OpenFlow group triggers another) is
      now supported.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ "importance" is now considered for flow eviction.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPTC_EVICTION is now implemented.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPTC_VACANCY_EVENTS is now implemented.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPMP_TABLE_DESC is now implemented.
    * Allow modifying the ICMPv4/ICMPv6 type and code fields.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ OFPT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG and OFPT_GET_ASYNC_CONFIG are
      now implemented.
  - ovs-ofctl:
    * New "out_group" keyword for OpenFlow 1.1+ matching on output group.
  - Tunnels:
    * Geneve tunnels can now match and set options and the OAM bit.
    * The nonstandard GRE64 tunnel extension has been dropped.
  - Support Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv1 and MLDv2).
  - Add 'symmetric_l3l4' and 'symmetric_l3l4+udp' hash functions.
  - sFlow agent now reports tunnel and MPLS structures.
  - New 'check-system-userspace', 'check-kmod' and 'check-kernel' Makefile
    targets to run a new system testsuite.  These tests can be run inside
    a Vagrant box.  See INSTALL.md for details
  - Mark --syslog-target argument as deprecated.  It will be removed in
    the next OVS release.
  - Added --user option to all daemons
  - Add support for connection tracking through the new "ct" action
    and "ct_state"/"ct_zone"/"ct_mark"/"ct_label" match fields.  Only
    available on Linux kernels with the connection tracking module loaded.
  - Add experimental version of OVN.  OVN, the Open Virtual Network, is a
    system to support virtual network abstraction.  OVN complements the
    existing capabilities of OVS to add native support for virtual network
    abstractions, such as virtual L2 and L3 overlays and security groups.
  - RHEL packaging:
    * DPDK ports may now be created via network scripts (see README.RHEL).
  - DPDK:
    * Requires DPDK 2.2
    * Added multiqueue support to vhost-user
    * Note: QEMU 2.5+ required for multiqueue support
  - SELinux:
    * Introduced SELinux policy package.

- New package: openvswitch-ovn
- Removed: openvswitch-2.4.0.tar.gg

- Don't install INSTALL.* files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 24 13:45:52 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- Removed: openvswitch-switch.template

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 24 12:53:50 UTC 2016 - kmroz@suse.com

- New upstream version 2.4.0
  - Flow table modifications are now atomic, meaning that each packet
    now sees a coherent version of the OpenFlow pipeline.  For
    example, if a controller removes all flows with a single OpenFlow
    "flow_mod", no packet sees an intermediate version of the OpenFlow
    pipeline where only some of the flows have been deleted.
  - Added support for SFQ, FQ_CoDel and CoDel qdiscs.
  - Add bash command-line completion support for ovs-vsctl Please check
    utilities/ovs-command-compgen.INSTALL.md for how to use.
  - The MAC learning feature now includes per-port fairness to mitigate
    MAC flooding attacks.
  - New support for a "conjunctive match" OpenFlow extension, which
    allows constructing OpenFlow matches of the form "field1 in
    {a,b,c...} AND field2 in {d,e,f...}" and generalizations.  For details,
    see documentation for the "conjunction" action in ovs-ofctl(8).
  - Add bash command-line completion support for ovs-appctl/ovs-dpctl/
    ovs-ofctl/ovsdb-tool commands.  Please check
    utilities/ovs-command-compgen.INSTALL.md for how to use.
  - The "learn" action supports a new flag "delete_learned" that causes
    the learned flows to be deleted when the flow with the "learn" action
    is deleted.
  - Basic support for the Geneve tunneling protocol. It is not yet
    possible to generate or match options. This is planned for a future
    release. The protocol is documented at
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gross-geneve-00
  - The OVS database now reports controller rate limiting statistics.
  - sflow now exports information about LACP-based bonds, port names, and
    OpenFlow port numbers, as well as datapath performance counters.
  - ovs-dpctl functionality is now available for datapaths integrated
    into ovs-vswitchd, via ovs-appctl.  Some existing ovs-appctl
    commands are now redundant and will be removed in a future
    release.  See ovs-vswitchd(8) for details.
  - OpenFlow:
    * OpenFlow 1.4 bundles are now supported for flow mods and port
      mods.  For flow mods, both 'atomic' and 'ordered' bundle flags
      are trivially supported, as all bundled messages are executed
      in the order they were added and all flow table modifications
      are now atomic to the datapath.  Port mods may not appear in
      atomic bundles, as port status modifications are not atomic.
    * IPv6 flow label and neighbor discovery fields are now modifiable.
    * OpenFlow 1.5 extended registers are now supported.
    * The OpenFlow 1.5 actset_output field is now supported.
    * OpenFlow 1.5 Copy-Field action is now supported.
    * OpenFlow 1.5 masked Set-Field action is now supported.
    * OpenFlow 1.3+ table features requests are now supported (read-only).
    * Nicira extension "move" actions may now be included in action sets.
    * "resubmit" actions may now be included in action sets.  The resubmit
      is executed last, and only if the action set has no "output" or "group"
      action.
    * OpenFlow 1.4+ flow "importance" is now maintained in the flow table.
    * A new Netronome extension to OpenFlow 1.5+ allows control over the
      fields hashed for OpenFlow select groups.  See "selection_method" and
      related options in ovs-ofctl(8) for details.
  - ovs-ofctl has a new '--bundle' option that makes the flow mod commands
    ('add-flow', 'add-flows', 'mod-flows', 'del-flows', and 'replace-flows')
    use an OpenFlow 1.4 bundle to operate the modifications as a single
    atomic transaction.  If any of the flow mods in a transaction fail, none
    of them are executed.  All flow mods in a bundle appear to datapath
    lookups simultaneously.
  - ovs-ofctl 'add-flow' and 'add-flows' commands now accept arbitrary flow
    mods as an input by allowing the flow specification to start with an
    explicit 'add', 'modify', 'modify_strict', 'delete', or 'delete_strict'
    keyword.  A missing keyword is treated as 'add', so this is fully
    backwards compatible.  With the new '--bundle' option all the flow mods
    are executed as a single atomic transaction using an OpenFlow 1.4 bundle.
  - ovs-pki: Changed message digest algorithm from MD5 to SHA-1 because
    MD5 is no longer secure and some operating systems have started to disable
    it in OpenSSL.
  - ovsdb-server: New OVSDB protocol extension allows inequality tests on
    "optional scalar" columns.  See ovsdb-server(1) for details.
  - ovs-vsctl now permits immutable columns in a new row to be modified in
    the same transaction that creates the row.
  - test-controller has been renamed ovs-testcontroller at request of users
    who find it useful for testing basic OpenFlow setups.  It is still not
    a necessary or desirable part of most Open vSwitch deployments.
  - Support for travis-ci.org based continuous integration builds has been
    added. Build failures are reported to build@openvswitch.org. See INSTALL.md
    file for additional details.
  - Support for the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1D-2004).
    The implementation has been tested successfully against the Ixia Automated
    Network Validation Library (ANVL).
  - Stats are no longer updated on fake bond interface.
  - Keep active bond slave selection across OVS restart.
  - A simple wrapper script, 'ovs-docker', to integrate OVS with Docker
    containers. If and when there is a native integration of Open vSwitch
    with Docker, the wrapper script will be retired.
  - Added support for DPDK Tunneling. VXLAN, GRE, and Geneve are supported
    protocols. This is generic tunneling mechanism for userspace datapath.
  - Support for multicast snooping (IGMPv1, IGMPv2 and IGMPv3)
  - Support for Linux kernels up to 4.0.x
  - The documentation now use the term 'destination' to mean one of syslog,
    console or file for vlog logging instead of the previously used term
    'facility'.
  - Support for VXLAN Group Policy extension
  - Initial support for the IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard. This
    contains rudimentary support for the LLDP protocol as needed for
    Auto-Attach.
  - The default OpenFlow and OVSDB ports are now the IANA-assigned
    numbers.  OpenFlow is 6653 and OVSDB is 6640.
  - Support for DPDK vHost.
  - Support for outer UDP checksums in Geneve and VXLAN.
  - The kernel vports with dependencies are no longer part of the overall
    openvswitch.ko but built and loaded automatically as individual kernel
    modules (vport-*.ko).
  - Support for STT tunneling.
  - Support to configure method (--syslog-method argument) that determines
    how daemons will talk with syslog.
  - Support for "ovs-appctl vlog/list-pattern" command that lets to query
    logging message format for each destination.
  - GRE64 and ipsec_gre64 tunnel protocol is deprecated and will be removed
    from OVS v2.5 release.
  * The openvswitch-testcontroller package is new.  It reintroduces the
    simple OpenFlow controller that was packaged with Open vSwitch prior to
    version 2.1, at request of users who find it useful for testing basic
    OpenFlow setups.  It is still not a necessary or desirable part of most
    Open vSwitch deployments.

- Fixed: log-check-module-loop.patch to work with new version.
- Removed: openvswitch-2.3.1.tar.gz
- Added: openvswitch-2.4.0.tar.gz
- Spec file work and cleanup.

Sun Jan 10 17:55:22 UTC 2016 - antoine.belvire@laposte.net

- Add calls to /sbin/ldconfig in %post and %postun
- Fix typo in Url

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 28 21:27:49 UTC 2014 - andrea@opensuse.org

- new upstream version 2.3.1
   - Compatibility with autoconf 2.63 (previously >=2.64)
   - ovs-pki: Changed message digest algorithm from MD5 to SHA-1 because
     MD5 is no longer secure and some operating systems have started to disable
     it in OpenSSL.
   - Keep active bond slave selection across OVS restart.

* v2.3.0 - 14 Aug 2014
   - OpenFlow 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 are now enabled by default in
     ovs-vswitchd.
   - Linux kernel datapath now has an exact match cache optimizing the
     flow matching process.
   - Datapath flows now have partially wildcarded tranport port field
     matches.  This reduces userspace upcalls, but increases the
     number of different masks in the datapath.  The kernel datapath
     exact match cache removes the overhead of matching the incoming
     packets with the larger number of masks, but when paired with an
     older kernel module, some workloads may perform worse with the
     new userspace.

* v2.2.0 - Internal Release
   - Internal ports are no longer brought up by default, because it
     should be an administrator task to bring up devices as they are
     configured properly.
   - ovs-vsctl now reports when ovs-vswitchd fails to create a new port or
     bridge.
   - The "ovsdbmonitor" graphical tool has been removed, because it was
     poorly maintained and not widely used.
   - New "check-ryu" Makefile target for running Ryu tests for OpenFlow
     controllers against Open vSwitch.  See INSTALL for details.
   - Added IPFIX support for SCTP flows and templates for ICMPv4/v6 flows.
   - Upon the receipt of a SIGHUP signal, ovs-vswitchd no longer reopens its
     log file (it will terminate instead). Please use 'ovs-appctl vlog/reopen'
     instead.
   - Support for Linux kernels up to 3.14. From Kernel 3.12 onwards OVS uses
     tunnel API for GRE and VXLAN.
   - Added experimental DPDK support.
   - Added support for custom vlog patterns in Python

- removed datapath-Add-support-for-Linux-3.12.patch no more required
- removed sle11-device-ops-backport.diff , not used before

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 14:25:35 UTC 2014 - kmroz@suse.com

- Prevent ovsdb-server from entering an infinite loop when
  processing logging levels during bringup.
  added: log-check-module-loop.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 27 12:56:32 UTC 2014 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 2.1.0:
   - Address prefix tracking support for flow tables.  New columns
     "prefixes" in OVS-DB table "Flow_Table" controls which packet
     header fields are used for address prefix tracking.  Prefix
     tracking allows the classifier to skip rules with longer than
     necessary prefixes, resulting in better wildcarding for datapath
     flows.  Default configuration is to not use any fields for prefix
     tracking.  However, if any flow tables contain both exact matches
     and masked matches for IP address fields, OVS performance may be
     increased by using this feature.
     * As of now, the fields for which prefix lookup can be enabled
       are: 'tun_id', 'tun_src', 'tun_dst', 'nw_src', 'nw_dst' (or
       aliases 'ip_src' and 'ip_dst'), 'ipv6_src', and 'ipv6_dst'.
       (Using this feature for 'tun_id' would only make sense if the
       tunnel IDs have prefix structure similar to IP addresses.)
     * There is a maximum number of fields that can be enabled for any
       one flow table.  Currently this limit is 3.
     * Examples:
       $ ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:0=@N1 -- \
         --id=@N1 create Flow_Table name=table0
       $ ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:1=@N1 -- \
         --id=@N1 create Flow_Table name=table1
       $ ovs-vsctl set Flow_Table table0 prefixes=ip_dst,ip_src
       $ ovs-vsctl set Flow_Table table1 prefixes=[]
   - TCP flags matching: OVS now supports matching of TCP flags.  This
     has an adverse performance impact when using OVS userspace 1.10
     or older (no megaflows support) together with the new OVS kernel
     module.  It is recommended that the kernel and userspace modules
     both are upgraded at the same time.
   - The default OpenFlow and OVSDB ports will change to
     IANA-assigned numbers in a future release.  Consider updating
     your installations to specify port numbers instead of using the
     defaults.
   - OpenFlow:
     * The OpenFlow 1.1+ "Write-Actions" instruction is now supported.
     * OVS limits the OpenFlow port numbers it assigns to port 32767 and
       below, leaving port numbers above that range free for assignment
       by the controller.
     * ovs-vswitchd now honors changes to the "ofport_request" column
       in the Interface table by changing the port's OpenFlow port
       number.
   - ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5 man page will contain graphviz/dot
     diagram only if graphviz package was installed at the build time.
 - Support for Linux kernels up to 3.11
   - ovs-dpctl:
     The "show" command also displays mega flow mask stats.
   - ovs-ofctl:
     * New command "ofp-parse-pcap" to dump OpenFlow from PCAP files.
   - ovs-controller has been renamed test-controller.  It is no longer
     packaged or installed by default, because too many users assumed
     incorrectly that ovs-controller was a necessary or desirable part
     of an Open vSwitch deployment.
   - Added vlog option to export to a UDP syslog sink.
   - ovsdb-client:
     * The "monitor" command can now monitor all tables in a database,
       instead of being limited to a single table.
   - The flow-eviction-threshold has been replaced by the flow-limit which is a
     hard limit on the number of flows in the datapath.  It defaults to 200,000
     flows.  OVS automatically adjusts this number depending on network
     conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  5 13:14:11 UTC 2013 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 2.0.0:
  - The ovs-vswitchd process is no longer single-threaded.  Multiple
    threads are now used to handle flow set up and asynchronous
    logging.
  - OpenFlow:
    * Experimental support for OpenFlow 1.1 (in addition to 1.2 and
      1.3, which had experimental support in 1.10).
    * New support for matching outer source and destination IP address
      of tunneled packets, for tunnel ports configured with the newly
      added "remote_ip=flow" and "local_ip=flow" options.
    * Support for matching on metadata 'pkt_mark' for interacting with
      other system components. On Linux this corresponds to the skb
      mark.
    * Support matching, rewriting SCTP ports
  - The Interface table in the database has a new "ifindex" column to
    report the interface's OS-assigned ifindex.
  - New "check-oftest" Makefile target for running OFTest against Open
    vSwitch.  See README-OFTest for details.
  - The flow eviction threshold has been moved to the Open_vSwitch table.
  - Database names are now mandatory when specifying ovsdb-server options
    through database paths (e.g. Private key option with the database name
    should look like "--private-key=db:Open_vSwitch,SSL,private_key").
  - Added ovs-dev.py, a utility script helpful for Open vSwitch developers.
  - Support for Linux kernels up to 3.10
  - ovs-ofctl:
    * New "ofp-parse" for printing OpenFlow messages read from a file.
  - Added configurable flow caching support to IPFIX exporter.
  - Dropped support for Linux pre-2.6.32.
  - Log file timestamps and ovsdb commit timestamps are now reported
    with millisecond resolution.  (Previous versions only reported
