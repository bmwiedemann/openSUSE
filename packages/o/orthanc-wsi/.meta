  <title>Whole Slide Imaging for Orthanc</title>
  <description>The Orthanc project provides three official tools to support DICOM for whole-slide microscopic imaging (WSI):
- A so-called “DICOM-izer” command-line tool that converts whole-slide images to DICOM series, following Supplement 145.
- A plugin that extends Orthanc with a Web viewer of whole-slide images for digital pathology.
- Another command-line tool that converts a DICOM series stored inside Orthanc, to a standard hierarchical TIFF image.
