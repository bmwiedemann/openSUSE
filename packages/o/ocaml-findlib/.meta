  <title>OCaml Library Manager</title>
  <description>
Findlib is a library manager for Objective Caml. It provides a convention how to store libraries, and a file format (&quot;META&quot;) to describe the properties of libraries. There is also a tool (ocamlfind) for interpreting the META files, so that it is very easy to use libraries in programs and scripts. 
Findlib is the de-facto standard for library management in OCaml.
