  <title>DSSSL Engine for SGML Documents</title>
  <description>OpenJade, the follow-up to Jade by James Clark, is an implementation of
the ISO/IEC 10179:1996 standard DSSSL (Document Style, Semantics, and
Specification Language); pronounce it &quot;dissl&quot;--it rhymes with whistle.

It has back-ends for SGML, RTF, MIF, TeX, and HTML.

The parser, &quot;nsgmls,&quot; and helper tools like &quot;sgmlnorm,&quot; &quot;spam,&quot;
&quot;spent,&quot; and &quot;sx&quot; are now included in the separate &quot;opensp&quot; package.</description>
