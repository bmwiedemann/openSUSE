Subject: [PATCH] Restrict the size of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs that OBJ_obj2txt will
 translate

OBJ_obj2txt() would translate any size OBJECT IDENTIFIER to canonical
numeric text form.  For gigantic sub-identifiers, this would take a very
long time, the time complexity being O(n^2) where n is the size of that
sub-identifier.

To mitigate this, a restriction on the size that OBJ_obj2txt() will
translate to canonical numeric text form is added, based on RFC 2578
(STD 58), which says this:

> 3.5. OBJECT IDENTIFIER values
>
> An OBJECT IDENTIFIER value is an ordered list of non-negative numbers.
> For the SMIv2, each number in the list is referred to as a sub-identifier,
> there are at most 128 sub-identifiers in a value, and each sub-identifier
> has a maximum value of 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).

Fixes otc/security#96

  Changes between 1.0.2t and 1.0.2u [20 Dec 2019]
 
+  *) Mitigate for the time it takes for `OBJ_obj2txt` to translate gigantic
+     OBJECT IDENTIFIER sub-identifiers to canonical numeric text form.
+
+     OBJ_obj2txt() would translate any size OBJECT IDENTIFIER to canonical
+     numeric text form.  For gigantic sub-identifiers, this would take a very
+     long time, the time complexity being O(n^2) where n is the size of that
+     sub-identifier.  (CVE-2023-2650)
+
+     To mitigitate this, `OBJ_obj2txt()` will only translate an OBJECT
+     IDENTIFIER to canonical numeric text form if the size of that OBJECT
+     IDENTIFIER is 586 bytes or less, and fail otherwise.
+
+     The basis for this restriction is RFC 2578 (STD 58), section 3.5. OBJECT
+     IDENTIFIER values, which stipulates that OBJECT IDENTIFIERS may have at
+     most 128 sub-identifiers, and that the maximum value that each sub-
+     identifier may have is 2^32-1 (4294967295 decimal).
+
+     For each byte of every sub-identifier, only the 7 lower bits are part of
+     the value, so the maximum amount of bytes that an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with
+     these restrictions may occupy is 32 * 128 / 7, which is approximately 586
+     bytes.

   *) Corrected documentation of X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() to mention
      that it does not enable policy checking. Thanks to
      David Benjamin for discovering this issue. (CVE-2023-0466)
