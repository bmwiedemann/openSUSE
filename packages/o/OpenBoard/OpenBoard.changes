- Update to version 1.3.6:
  * Fix several issues relating to copy-pasting and
    cut-and-pasting elements from one page or document to another.
  * Fix an issue where pen strokes that had been erased with the
    eraser would reappear after saving and loading.
  * Fix an issue where duplicating a pen stroke that had been
    moved could cause the new stroke to be placed in the wrong
    position.
  * Fix an issue where strokes could be badly placed after using
    the "undo" and "redo" functions.
  * Fix an issue where compass strokes were not saved (when
    making several strokes, only the first one was saved).
  * Fix an issue where pages could be truncated when exporting to
    PDF.
  * Fix an issue where locked items could be moved when part of a
    multiple selection
  * (Document mode) Fix document selection after deleting a
    trashed document.
  * Tweak the background grid color for the dark background.
  * The mask tool can now be resized non-proportionately.
  * Re-implemented automatic update checking, which will appear
    to users when the next version is released.
- Changes from version 1.3.5:
  * Fix detection of "cloned" multi-monitor setups to avoid
    multi-screen mode being activated in this configuration.
    [Note: some problems remain with multi-monitor setups on some
    Linux versions.].
  * Text items: Text can no longer be selected or edited if the
    text item is marked as non-editable through its menu.
  * Text items: On page load, text items no longer take keyboard
    focus.
  * Library pane: Fix moving of items (upon moving an item to a
    folder, the item would not immediately disappear from its
    current location).
  * Library pane: Fix nested folder issue in breadcrumbs trail (two
    folders that were at the same path and whose names started with
    the same characters were considered by the breadcrumbs trail to
    be nested).
  * Document view: Fix folder names not being saved after renaming
    them.
  * Fix audio item saving (v1.3.3 bug): Documents containing an
    audio item were saved incorrectly, making the audio unplayable
    upon page load.
  * Desktop mode: Eraser and marker preview circles now disappear
    when the cursor hovers over the left or right-hand toolbars, as
    in board mode.
- Drop OpenBoard-fix-call-of-overloaded-abs-is-ambiguous.patch
  (fixed upstream).

  * Use "libquazip-qt5-devel" instead of "quazip-qt5-devel" in
    build requirements to fix build on Leap.

Fri Jun 30 13:33:43 UTC 2017 - adam.majer@suse.de
