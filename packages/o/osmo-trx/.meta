  <title>SDR transceiver that implements Layer 1 of a GSM BTS</title>
  <description>OsmoTRX is a software-defined radio transceiver that implements the Layer 1
physical layer of a BTS comprising the following 3GPP specifications:

TS 05.01 &quot;Physical layer on the radio path&quot;
TS 05.02 &quot;Multiplexing and Multiple Access on the Radio Path&quot;
TS 05.04 &quot;Modulation&quot;
TS 05.10 &quot;Radio subsystem synchronization&quot;

In this context, BTS is &quot;Base transceiver station&quot;. It's the stations that
connect mobile phones to the mobile network.

3GPP is the &quot;3rd Generation Partnership Project&quot; which is the collaboration
between different telecommunication associations for developing new
generations of mobile phone networks. (post-2G/GSM)
