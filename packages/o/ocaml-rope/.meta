  <title>Ropes (&quot;heavyweight strings&quot;) for OCaml</title>
  <description>Ropes are a scalable string implementation: they are designed for efficient operation that involve the string as a whole such as concatenation and substring. This library implements ropes for OCaml (it is rich enough to replace strings).</description>
