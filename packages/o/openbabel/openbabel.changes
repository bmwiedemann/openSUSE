- Skip problematic tests and increase timeout on riscv64

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 20:05:18 UTC 2022 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Don't define %upstream version from %version: %upstream_version
  is used in Source tag and osc download service does not evaluate
  %() nor %{lua:} in Source tags for security reasons.
- Drop entirely baselibs.conf: 32bit libraries seem unnecessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 23 18:56:50 UTC 2022 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Remove libinchi0 from baselibs.conf: Bundled inchi is not built
  anymore.

Sun Aug 14 16:02:16 UTC 2022 - Antoine Belvire <antoine.belvire@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 3.1.1:
  * Fixes for packaging.
  * No features or significant bug fixes were involved.
- Changes from version 3.1.0:
  * This version represents additional API and is
    backwards-compatible with the 3.0 release.
  * For a full list of changes, see:
    https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ReleaseNotes/ob310.html
- Changes from version 3.0.0:
  * This release represents a major update and is strongly
    recommended for all users.
  * It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a
    few places. For information on migrating from the previous
    version, please see:
    https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UseTheLibrary/migration.html#migrating-to-3-0
  * A sample of major new features:
    + Code for handling implicit hydrogens and kekulization has
      been entirely replaced. As well as being accurate, the new
      approach is much faster.
    + Speed of reading and writing SMILES has been improved by
      more  than 50-fold.
    + Removal of the old 'babel' binary in favor of the newer
      'obabel' command-line tool.
    + New improved fragment-based 3D coordinate generation code.
    + New API for handling reactions stored as molecules (e.g.
      Reaction InChI, etc.).
    + New API for copying part of an OBMol as a substructure.
    + Support for Maestro file format.
  * For a full list of changes, see:
    https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html
- Remove upstreamed patches:
  * fix_narrowing.patch
  * fix_yasara.patch
- Add patches:
  * openbabel-3.1.1-test-python3-escape-chars.patch: Fix python
    test failure (gh#openbabel/openbabel#2217).
  * openbabel-3.1.1-test-python3-imports.patch: Fix ImportError in
    python tests (gh#openbabel/openbabel!2378).
  * openbabel-3.1.1-version-number.patch: Fix version number.
  * openbabel-3.1.1-gcc-12.patch: Fix build with GCC 12
    (gh#openbabel/openbabel!2493).
  * openbabel-3.1.1-wx-stl-compat.patch: Fix GUI build against
    wxWidgets compiled with STL (gh#openbabel/openbabel!2527).
- Build against system's inchi library instead of the bundled one.
- Add maeparser-devel as build dependency: Needed for Maestro
  support.
- Update subpackages:
  * Compile and package GUI.
  * Move plugins from CLI package (i.e. main package) to library
    package: They should be available to other library clients
    without requiring the CLI tools.
  * Move data files from CLI package to library package: Some are
    required by the library, some are required by its plugins,
    let's move everything to library package for now.
- Drop __DATE__ and __TIME__ tweaks for reproducibility: These GCC
  macros now use SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.

  it to %{_libdir} resulting in a duplicate /usr in the module
  search path which causes the plugins not to be found (boo#997190)
