Preface: 
========

This is the Release-Notes of the last official release.
However,
this version is based on the git branch "openafs-stable-1_8_x"
and thus has additional changes beside the ones for 1.8.11.
The reason for this is the compatibility with current Linux-Kernels.
The ChangeLog gives you all commits applied since then.
The versioning-scheme of these packages is: openafs-$LAST_OFFICIAL_RELEASE.git$DATE_OF_NEWEST_COMMIT

                       User-Visible OpenAFS Changes

OpenAFS 1.8.11

  All platforms

    * Check Rx RPC call number in incoming packets before allocating new
      RPC calls to avoid re-running RPC calls when spurious packets are
      received (15562)

    * Fix memory leaks (15516 15517)

    * Fix build failure when building with _FORTIFY_SOURCE (15518 15519)

    * Fix build failures when building with the clang compiler (15540 15541
      15547 15548)

    * Improve error detection in OpenAFS directories for both clients
      and servers (15544 15545 15546)

    * Add a Makefile target to build Red Hat RPM packages (15514)

    * Add support for custom version numbers in Red Hat RPM packages (15513)

  All server platforms

    * Fix File Server and Protection Server crashes due to recursive thread
      lock bug (15609)

    * Fix fileserver crashes during startup (15509 15543)

    * The bosserver no longer creates the client configuration directory and
      "ThisCell" and "CellServDB" symlinks.  The "vos", "pts", and "bos"
      commands now read cell configuration from the server cell configuration
      directory when the client cell configuration directory is not present.
      This change allows server packaging to be independent of client packaging
      and removes the need for client configuration artifacts on hosts running
      server processes only (15510 15511 15512)

    * Print a warning in the volserver log when an older version of a volume
      is restored over an existing volume, unless the volume was restored with
      "-overwrite full" (15531)

    * Print a warning in the bosserver log when the bosserver was not started
      in restricted mode (15537)

    * Avoid unbounded string copies when looking up volumes by name in
      the vlserver (15538)

    * Fix off-by-one directory entry name size check in salvager (15598)

  All client platforms

    * Updated the CellServDB to the latest version from grand.central.org
      (15603)

  All UNIX/Linux client platforms

    * Fix PAG object memory leak which can degrade performance (15506)

    * Improve kernel memory reclamation after accessing a large number of
      files (15536)

    * Improve cache corruption detection and refetch cache entries
      when cache entry size mismatches are detected (15532 15533 15535)

    * Fix panic in user-space client (libuafs, Fuse client) (15539)

  Linux clients

    * Add support for Linux 6.7 (15600)

    * Add support for Linux 6.6 (15575 15589 15590)

    * Add support for Linux 6.5 (15520 15521 15522 15523 15558)

    * Fix BUG when directory entry names are longer than 16 characters.
      Affects Linux 6.5 or higher built with GCC 13 or higher (15599)

    * Invalidate Linux VFS dentry caches in the AFS filesystem when running
      "fs flush*" commands. This reduces the need to drop Linux VFS caches
      by writing to the "/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" file when
      troubleshooting (15515)

    * Fix build failures (15507 15508 15596 15542 15549)

  macOS

    * Add support for MacOS 14 ("Sonoma") (15602)
