Attention:

This is a snapshot of the git branch openafs-stable-1_8_x to 
accomodate for the Linux kernel 5.8.

The original release notes of 1.8.6. read:


                       User-Visible OpenAFS Changes

OpenAFS 1.8.6

  All platforms

    * Address warnings and errors encountered when building OpenAFS with
      modern compilers like gcc9 or recent clang (13727..45 13749..50 13756
      13846 13879)

    * Avoid some rare cases of Rx calls getting stuck in the incoming queue
      (13892)

    * Display the usage of simple commands (commands without subcommands) when
      run only with the -help option (13894)

    * Fix a memory leak in the cache manager and the fileserver while
      processing "fs uuid" or "fs setcbaddr" (13899)

    * Fix a memory leak when reopening krb local realms configuration (13900)

    * Avoid possible crashes when freeing kerberos contexts (13902)

  All server platforms

    * Do not leave empty directories behind in the file server vice partition
      when running the "vos zap -force" command (13897)

    * Fix "vos zap -force" failures when the volume being zapped does not have
      an entry in the fileserver's volume group cache (e.g., during fileserver
      startup) (13896)

    * Relax the length limits on some membership lists used in ptserver RPCs,
      introduced in release 1.8.0 to prevent denial of service attacks, to
      accommodate use cases of some larger existing sites (13844)

    * Improved diagnostics and error messages (13898 13906..8 13938)

    * Ensure that fileservers running in readonly mode actually reject all
      write requests, but introduce a -admin-write switch allowing writes
      by members of the system:administrators group (14018 14019)

  All client platforms

    * Require the -insecure_des switch to be passed to aklog and klog.krb5
      to make them work with single-DES encryption types (13791)

    * Avoid a panic due to a retryable error - retry in a background request
      instead (13847)

    * Avoid blocking other functions on the completion of some potentially
      long-running RPCs issued by the server (13893)

    * Fix a potential memory leak in "fs getserverprefs" when the pioctl fails
      with E2BIG (13895)

    * Avoid the local cache incorrectly reflecting the state of a file on the
      fileserver after flushing large chunks of data to the server. This
      issue was present on FreeBSD clients, but probably not Linux/Solaris
      ones (13951) (RT #135041)

    * After a VLDB lookup of a read-write volume already failed, don't bother
      looking up corresponding read-only or backup volumes since those lookups
      are bound to fail, in order to make the client more responsive and
      avoid unnecessary load on the vlserver (13968)

    * Allow a "vos rename" to succeed if the new volume name is the same as
      that in the current VLDB, to make it possible to complete a previously
      interrupted volume rename (14055)

    * Allow processes which are sleeping due to PAG throttling to be killable
      (13974).

    * Fix set PAG failures due to signals (13975).

  Linux clients

    * Support mainline kernels up to and including 5.7 (14069 14094 14095
      14209 14210)

    * Make builds succeed with --enable-checking for mainline kernels
      5.3-rc2 and later (13910)

    * Avoid possible deadlocks (13748 13765)

    * Fix build of libuafs on ppc64le (14104)

    * Fix build on certain recent 32-bit distributions (14234) (RT #135084)

  macOS

    * Support building, packaging and notarization on macOS 10.15 "Catalina"
      (14031..7 14068)

  Microsoft Windows

    * Build fixes (13848..52)
