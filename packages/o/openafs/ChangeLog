    Linux-6.0: Replace add_to_page_cache
    
    Linux 6.0 removed the add_to_page_cache function in the Linux commit:
        'filemap: Remove add_to_page_cache() and add_to_page_cache_locked()'
        (2bb876b58d593d7f2522ec0f41f20a74fde76822)
    
    The replacement function, filemap_add_folio function is exported as GPL,
    but a non-GPL wrapper was provided in the Linux 5.15 commit:
        'mm/filemap: Add filemap_add_folio()'
        (9dd3d069406cea073fc633e77bc59abbfde8c6c4)
    which changed the GPL exported function add_to_page_cache_lru to a
    non-GPL exported function.
    
    The function add_to_page_cache_lru functionally combines the
    add_to_page_cache with lru_cache_add.  Within afs, all the calls to
    add_to_page_cache follow the pattern of calling the lru_cache_add
    via the wrapper afs_lru_cache_add immediately after (except in one case
    noted below).
    
    Add an autoconf check to see if add_to_page_cache_lru is available.
    
    Introduce a new wrapper function afs_add_to_page_cache_lru that handles
    calling either add_to_page_cache/afs_lru_cache_add or
    add_to_page_cache_lru.
    
    As noted above there is one function, afs_linux_bypass_readpages, that
    calls add_to_page_cache but does not immediately call afs_lru_cache_add.
    This function is only used in Linux kernels prior to 5.18, see the
    commit:
        'Linux-5.18: replace readpages with readahead' (7a181415db)
    Since this code path is only built for a Linux kernel level where
    add_to_page_cache should also exists, we do not replace this call.
    
    NOTE:
    The add_to_page_cache_lru was moved into mm/folio-compat.c which has a
    comment indicating that callers of these functions should migrate to
    folio calls.  However the replacement folio call that is needed by afs,
    filemap_add_folio, is exported as GPL.

    afs: Clean up compiler warning casting ptr to int
    
    In osi_probe.c, the macro 'check_result' casts a pointer to an int which
    on older Linux kernels (e.g. 2.6.18) produces several lines with the C
    warning:
    
    ... warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
    
    Change the cast from int to long int.
    
    Linux 2.6.18 doesn't provide intptr_t or uintptr_t, and stdint.h is not
    available to kernel modules.  But the size of a pointer is the size of a
    long (see uintptr_t in linux/types.h - Linux 2.6.24+), so
    change the cast from int to long.
    
    Note that the this code by default only gets pulled in for older Linux
    kernels (e.g. 2.6.18).  For newer kernels, ENABLE_LINUX_SYSCALL_PROBING
    is not defined, and so most of osi_probe.c is not built.

    dir: Set srcdir correctly in src/dir/test
    
    srcdir is a magic variable that needs to be set to @srcdir@, not some
    relative path like ../../.. (which will usually be somewhere in the
    objdir, not srcdir). Set it correctly in here.
    
    Without this, objdir builds can fail with:
    
        make[4]: Entering directory '...obj/src/dir/test'
        make[4]: *** No rule to make target 'dtest.o', needed by 'dtest'.  Stop.
    
    Which happens because the automatic rule for dtest.o can't be
    constructed, since we cannot find dtest.c automatically because srcdir
    isn't set properly.
    
    This has been broken since commit 37b4195d (dtest-20021111), but was
    not noticeable until commit 192a2ff4 (dir: make dtest buildable
    again), since that caused dtest to actually get built.
    
    Also set LIBS correctly in here, using the conventional ${TOP_LIBDIR},
    since ${srcdir} no longer points to "../../..".

    LINUX: Use bitwise & for f_flags test
    
    This code is clearly supposed to be masking f_flags with O_ACCMODE, and
    so should be using a bitwise &, not the boolean &&.  Clang complains
    about this, causing a warning (which breaks the build with
    --enable-checking):
    
    error: use of logical '&&' with constant operand [-Werror,
            -Wconstant-logical-operand]
            } else if ((file->f_flags && O_ACCMODE) != O_WRONLY) {
                                      ^  ~~~~~~~~~
    .../osi_vnodeops.c:3192:28: note: use '&' for a
            bitwise operation
    
    For the current code without this commit the behavior of this
    check is as follows:
    
       When f_flags is:         The check is:
       ====================     =============
       O_RDONLY                 True  (as expected)
       O_WRONLY                 False (as expected)
       O_RDWR                   False (incorrect)
       has some non-O_ACCMODE   False (incorrect)
        bit is set
    
    The incorrect check doesn't cause any problems for overall correctness,
    but it does mean that in those cases afs_linux_fillpage will not be
    called and that partially-written pages will be left out of date and any
    reader will need to fill the page again.
    
    Fix this by using the bitwise &.
    
    There is also an out of date link to the Linux documentation.  Update
    the comment to point to the current documentation that is in the Linux
    source tree.

    systemd: do not load the 'openafs' module on boot
    
    remove /etc/sysconfig/modules/openafs-client.modules, i.e no longer have
    systemd run "modprobe openafs" at boot, on RPM-based systems.
    
    This had been introduced with a reference to the Fedora packaging guide
    at the time. However, this mechanism was meant just for persistent
    driver modules (i.e expected to stay loaded over the runtime) - the
    "openafs" module is loaded (and unloaded) by the actual systemd unit.
    
    The systemd unit that processes the above file comes from "initscripts",
    this is optional in later Fedoras/RHELs and so the file may not even be
    processed (/usr/lib/modules-load.d/ would be an alternative mechanism to
    load modules at boot.. if needed).
    
    This change is mostly cosmetic, although RT#135204 showed that having
    the "openafs" module loaded without a client running can actually be
    harmful.

    linux: Call put_page if errors in aops->readpages
    
    Within the address_space_operations readpages function, when we remove a
    page from the page->lru list, we must ensure that the page reference
    count is decremented via put_page.
    
    There are two cases within the flow of the afs_linux_readpages where
    we remove a page from the page->lru list, but fail to put_page() it.
    
     - If we go through afs_linux_bypass_readpages we fail to call
       put_page() if the page index is larger than the index calculated from
       i_size_read for the cache file.
     - If get_dcache_readahead returns an error in afs_linux_readpages, we
       fail to put_page().  This can happen if there was a problem opening
       the cache file, or if the cache file has no a_ops->readpage.
    
    Add a call to put_page in afs_linux_bypass_readpages when the page index
    is greater than the index calculated from the i_size_read for the cache
    file.
    
    Add a call to put_page in afs_linux_readpages if get_dcache_readahead
    returns an error.
    
    Note: The condition of not calling put_page if there was an error
    opening the cache file was introduced by commit 'LINUX: Don't panic on
    some file open errors' (af73b9a3b1f), which replaced an assert with
    code that handled the error.  The other conditions have existed since
    the relevant code was introduced.
    
    In addition, the problems addressed by this commit are not present in
    Linux kernels 5.8 and greater when the commit 'Linux-5.18: replace
    readpages with readahead' (7a181415db1) is present, because we call
    afs_linux_readahead instead of afs_linux_readpages.

    Linux-5.19: Remove flags from aops->write_begin
    
    The Linux 5.19 commits:
    
     fs: Remove aop flags parameter from grab_cache_page_write_begin()
      (b7446e7c)
     fs: Remove flags parameter from aops->write_begin (9d6b0cd7)
    
    removed the flags parameter from the address space operations
    'write_begin' as well as removing the flags parameter from the Linux
    function 'grab_cache_page_write_begin'.
    
    Add an autoconf test to see if grab_cache_page_write_begin takes 2 or
    3 parameters. Use this as a test to determine if the address space
    operations 'write_begin' takes a flags parameter.
    
    Create a version of afs_linux_write_begin that does not take a flags
    parameter, which also calls grab_cache_page_write_begin without flags.

    Linux-5.19: Rename aops readpage to read_folio
    
    With Linux commits:
      mm,fs: Remove aops->readpage   (7e0a126519)
      fs: Introduce aops->read_folio (5efe7448a1)
    
    the address space operations method 'readpage' was replaced with
    read_folio.  The operation behaves the same, except instead of taking a
    struct page parameter, the new function takes a folio structure.
    
    Add an autoconf test for the address space operation entry read_folio
    
    Replace the references to an address space operations' readpage with
    read_folio.  Note that the function Linux page_folio can be used to
    obtain the required pointer to the folio for a given page.
    
    Introduce afs_linux_read_folio that accepts a folio and calls
    afs_linux_readpage with the page associated with that folio.

    Linux-5.18: replace readpages with readahead
    
    The linux 5.18 commit 'fs: Remove ->readpages address space
    operation' (704528d8) removes the address_space_operations operation
    "readpages", which is replaced with the "readahead" operation
    that was introduced with the 5.8 commit 'mm: add readahead address
    space operation' (8151b4c8).
    
    When readahead is called, the pages in 'rac' have already been added to
    the lru caches and are locked. For each page that we get from the 'rac'
    (i.e. from 'readahead_page(rac)'), we must unlock and put_page the page;
    if we successfully populated the page with data, we also set
    PageUpToDate.  If we don't process all the pages in 'rac', the caller
    will handle cleaning up any remaining pages; we don't need to unlock/put
    them or touch them at all.
      (See Linux Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst)
    
    Add an autoconf test to detect the presence of 'readahead' in the
    address_space_operations structure.
    
    For the implementation of readahead (which is contained in Linux's
    osi_vnodeops.c):
    
    Add new functions 'afs_linux_bypass_readahead' and 'afs_linux_readahead'
    as replacements for 'afs_bypass_readpages' and 'afs_linux_readpages'
    when the linux kernel supports the readahead operation.
    
    Notes:
      In afs_linux_bypass_readahead, the pages are already locked and are
      already in the page cache, we just need to place the page into the
      iovecp.  The page's refcount will be decremented and will be unlocked
      when processing the read request.
    
      In afs_linux_readahead, the lrupages is needed in case a page is added
      to the cachefp's mapping in afs_linux_read_cache (which also handles
      unlocking the page).
    
      In afs_linux_readahead, if there is no tdc, we must still unlock the
      page otherwise the read process will wait on that page.

    lwp: Ignore dangling-pointer warning in process.c
    
    In lwp/process.c the address of a stack variable is saved as part of
    creating a new context.  GCC-12 is flagging the statement with a
    diagnostic:
    
      ./process.c:46:24: error: storing the address of local variable
          ‘stackvar’ in ‘*savearea.topstack’ [-Werror=dangling-pointer=]
       46 |     savearea->topstack = (char *)&stackvar;
          |     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    In this particular case, the code is meaning to save the address of the
    stack in preparation of setting up a new context, which requires knowing
    the address the current stack.
    
    The diagnostic is changed from a warning to an error when configured
    with --enable-checking.
    
    Set the env variable CFLAGS_NODANGLING_POINTER to
    '-Wno-dangling-pointer' if the compiler supports the option and update
    the src/lwp/Makefile.in to use the flag when compiling process.c

     src/afs/afs_vcache.c:3161:25: error: the comparison will always
        evaluate as ‘false’ for the address of ‘v’ will never be NULL

    When the vcache structure does not have the vnode embedded the expansion
    of the AFSTOV macro results in:
       ((avc)->v)

    When the vcache structure does have the vnode embedded, the expansion of
    the macro results in:
       (&(avc)->v)
    which tests the address of 'v', which will never be NULL in this case.
    
    Update afs.h to add a new define 'AFS_VCACHE_EMBEDDED_VNODE' when the
    vcache structure contains an embedded vnode structure.  Restructure the
    preprocessor statements for the AFSTOV definition
    
    Avoid testing AFSTOV(x) against NULL when AFS_VCACHE_EMBEDDED_VNODE is
    defined.
    
    The diagnostic is changed from a warning to an error when configured

    autoconf: fix detection for fallthrough attribute
    
    Due to bug <https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?9949>,
    ax_gcc_func_attribute.m4 fails to properly detect __attribute__((fallthrough))
    in clang. Until this is fixed in autoconf-archive upstream, fix our
    local copy of ax_gcc_func_attribute.m4, so we can detect
    __attribute__((fallthrough)) to make --enable-checking work with clang.

    cf: Use -Werror when checking for -Wno-* flags
    
    When detecting valid compiler flags clang behaves differently than gcc
    for certain types of flags.  Specifically, gcc will ignore an unknown
    "-Wno-someflag" while clang will issue a warning.  If using clang and
    --enable-checking is specified, this difference causes a build failure
    because the warning for the unknown flag is turned into an error.
    
    The autoconf macro AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS (via the underlying macro
    AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAGS) looks specifically for errors and not warnings
    to determine if the flag is valid.  In order to properly catch the above
    type of unknown compiler flags, a '-Werror' must be passed as an
    extra-flag.
    
    Update the autoconf functions that use AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS to use
    '-Werror' as an extra flag when testing for "-Wno-..." flags.
    
    Note, for gcc, the test may (incorrectly) think that the compiler
    supports the given flag, but that is okay, since the flag will be
    ignored by gcc during the build without raising any warnings or errors.

    Linux-5.17: Kernel build uses -Wcast-function-type
    
    The linux 5.17 commit:
      "Makefile: Enable -Wcast-function-type" (552a23a0)
    added the -Wcast-function-type compiler flag for kernel module builds.
    
    This change catches a type mismatch in the external files obtained from
    heimdal: hcrypto/evp.c and hcrypto/evp-algs.c and produces the following
    type of compile time error messages.
    
      src/libafs/MODLOAD-.../evp.c: In function ‘hc_EVP_md_null’:
      src/libafs/MODLOAD-.../evp.c:501:2: error: cast between incompatible
          function types from ‘void (*)(void *)’ to ‘int (*)(EVP_MD_CTX *)’
              {aka ‘int (*)(struct hc_EVP_MD_CTX *)’}
              [-Werror=cast-function-type]
      501 |  (hc_evp_md_init)null_Init,
          |  ^
    
    Use AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS to create a CFLAGS_NOCAST_FUNCTION_TYPE
    macro to disable this warning and update the CFLAGS for these 2 files
    for the Linux libafs build.
    
    Update the CODING documentation to add the new exceptions.  In addition
    add a brief description on how to set up autoconf to add a new build
    macro to suppress compiler warnings.
    
    Note: upstream heimdal has committed a fix for this in:
    
       hcrypto: Fix return type for null_Init, null_Update and null_Final

    LINUX: Don't panic on some file open errors
    
    Commit 'LINUX: Return NULL for afs_linux_raw_open error' (f6af4a155)
    updated afs_linux_raw_open to return NULL on some errors, but still
    panics if obtaining the dentry fails.
    
    Commit 'afs: Verify osi_UFSOpen worked' (c6b61a451) updated callers of
    osi_UFSOpen to verify whether or not the open was successful.  This
    meant osi_UFSOpen (and routines it calls) could pass back an error
    indication rather than panic when an error is encountered.
    
    Update afs_linux_raw_open to return a failure instead of panic if unable
    to obtain a dentry.
    
    Update osi_UFSOpen to return a NULL instead of panic if unable to obtain
    memory or fails to open the file. All callers of osi_UFSOpen handle a
    fail return, though some will still issue a panic.
    
    Update afs_linux_readpage_fastpath and afs_linux_readpages to not panic
    if afs_linux_raw_open fails.  Instead of panic, return an error.
    
    For testing, an error can be forced by removing a file from the
    cache directory.

    clang-10: ignore fallthrough warning in generated code
    
    Clang-10 will not recognize '/* fall through */' as an indicator to
    turn off the fallthrough warning due to the lack of a 'break' in a case

    Code generated by flex uses the '/* fall through */' comments to turn
    off compiler warnings for fallthroughs in case statements.
    
    For code generated by flex, ignore the implicit-fallthrough via pragma
    or disable the warning via a compile time flag.
    
    Add new env variable "CFLAGS_NOIMPLICIT_FALLTHROUGH" to selectively
    disable the compile check in Makefiles when checking is enabled.

    LINUX: Honor --enable-checking for libafs
    
    When we build the kernel module on LINUX, we don't pass in any of our
    CFLAGS, since the Linux buildsystem itself figures out what flags are
    needed. However, this means that we don't pass in -Werror when
    --enable-checking is turned on, so warnings may not cause the build to
    fail.
    
    To fix this, create a new autoconf variable, called CFLAGS_WERROR,
    that only contains -Werror if --enable-checking is turned on. We then
    pass that into the Linux module buildsystem, so -Werror is given to
    the compiler when building our module.

    libadmin: Fix isAlias may be uninitialized warning
    
    The cfgutil_HostNameIsAlias() function has an output parameter called
    isAlias, which is used when cfgutil_HostIsAlias() returns non-zero.
    However, it possible for isAlias to not be set before returning. GCC 12
    issues a warning about the possible use of the uninitialized isAlias
    variable:
    
        cfginternal.c:366:32: error: ‘isAlias’ may be used uninitialized
           [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
    
    Initialize the cfgutil_HostNameIsAlias() isAlias output flag to false.
    Also, fix the misleading code indentation around the
    cfgutil_HostNameIsAlias() call.

    bucoord: Fix doDispatch() array-parameter gcc warning
    
    The doDispatch() prototype does not match the function definition. The
    targv parameter is declared as an unbounded array in the prototype, but
    is defined as a bounded array. As of GCC 12, a warning is issued for the
    mismatch.
    
        main.c:346:18: error: argument 2 of type ‘char *[100]’ with
          mismatched bound [-Werror=array-parameter=]
        bucoord_internal.h:123:40: note: previously declared as ‘char *[]’
    
    Within doDispatch(), the targv argument is just passed to cmd_Dispatch()
    (this is the only use of targv). Since cmd_Displatch() expects an
    unbounded array, update the doDispatch() definition to match the
    prototype.

    Fix PrintInode() mismatched array parameter warnings
    
    The PrintInode() prototypes do not match the function definitions.
    
    When AFS_64BIT_IOPS_ENV is defined (which is the common case and is
    required for namei), the buffer parameter is declared as a bounded
    character array (afs_ino_str_t) in the prototype, but is defined as an
    unbounded character pointer.  When AFS_64BIT_IOPS_ENV is not defined
    (for legacy 32-bit inode vice partitions), PrintInode() is declared with
    no specified parameters.
    
    A static buffer is used to hold the formatted string when a NULL is
    passed as the first argument to PrintInode(). However, this method is
    only used by the volinfo and iopen utility programs.
    
    Fix the mismatch function prototypes and definitions to use the bounded
    char array (afs_ino_str_t) in all cases.  Remove the deprecated function
    declaration with no specified parameters. Update vol-info and iopen to
    pass an afs_ino_str_t buffer and remove the now unused static buffer.
    Update the duplicated PrintInode() function definition in namei_ops.c.
    (This duplicated code could be removed in a future commit.)

    pts: Fix stringop-overflow warnings

    user and group names. As of GCC 11, callers which provide the names as

    klog.krb5 -lifetime is not implemented
    
    The klog.krb5 -lifetime option was copied from earlier versions of log
    and klog, which had the ability to set the krb4 token lifetime. However,
    the -lifetime option is not feasible the krb5 version, and so is not
    implemented in klog.krb5.
    
    Update the klog.krb5 man page to document the -lifetime option has no
    effect.  Remove the code which unnecessarily checks the unused klog.krb5
    -lifetime command line argument.
    
    The unused lifetime variable was discovered by Pat Riehecky using the
    clang scan-build static analyzer.

    ubik: do not reuse the offset variable for the sync site address
    
    The ubik SendFile function performs a sanity check of the host address
    before proceeding with the file transfer.  Currently this check reuses
    the file offset local variable to hold the value of the sync site
    address, a 32-bit IPv4 address. Not only is this confusing, but also
    causes a signed/unsigned type mismatch when comparing host addresses.
    Instead of being so stingy with local variables, declare a new local
    variable of the correct type to hold the value of the sync site address.
    
    This separation is also a prerequisite for supporting larger address
    types in the future.

    Change AFS*_LINUXnn_ENV to AFS*_LINUX_ENV
    
    The minimum Linux kernel that is now supported is linux-2.6.18.  The
    Linux versioned preprocessor macros AFS_*LINUXnn_ENV are no longer
    needed to distinguish the different levels of Linux and can be merged
    into just a single set of macros.
    
    Perform a global change of _LINUX\d+_ENV to _LINUX_ENV. e.g.
       AFS_LINUX24_ENV       -> AFS_LINUX_ENV
       AFS_USR_LINUX24_ENV   -> AFS_USR_LINUX_ENV
       AFS_AMD64_LINUX20_ENV -> AFS_AMD64_LINUX_ENV
    
    Replace the multiple definitions for the versioned 'AFS*_LINUXnn_ENV'
    with just single non-version definitions 'AFS*_LINUX_ENV'.
    
    Apart from replacing the now-redundant #define directives and tidying up
    a few comments at the close of a preprocessor block to match their
    current form, this commit was done using a mechanical change of the
    variable names and did not reduce preprocessor statements that could now
    be combined or eliminated.  Nor does this commit remove dead code.  A
    follow-up commit (Cleanup AFS_*LINUX_ENV usage) will handle these
    changes.
    
    The updates should have no functional changes.

    afs: Always define our own osi_timeval32_t
    
    Since OpenAFS 1.0, osi_GetTime has taken a timeval-like pointer, which
    contains 32-bit fields (the actual type has been called either
    osi_timeval_t or osi_timeval32_t over time). For platforms that have a
    native timeval-like type with 32-bit fields, we just define
    osi_timeval32_t to that type, and elsewhere we define our own struct
    to be osi_timeval32_t. For platforms that use the native timeval, we
    can then define osi_GetTime() to just be, e.g., microtime().
    
    This approach is difficult to maintain, though, because we must keep
    track of whether 'struct timeval' contains 32-bit fields on each
    platform, which can depend on many factors. It's easy to make mistakes
    (the current tree already contains mistakes), and there's not much
    benefit.
    
    To avoid all of this, just always define osi_timeval32_t to be our own
    struct with afs_int32 fields, and provide definitions for osi_GetTime
    that convert from the native time struct to our osi_timeval32_t. This
    does mean that for some platforms we do an unnecessary type
    conversion, but this is a small price to pay for more straightforward
    and maintainable code.
    
    To be a little more sure that our types are correct, change
    osi_GetTime to be defined as an inline function instead of a macro.
    
    At the same time, do a similar conversion for the KERNEL
    implementation of the rx clock_GetTime function. Get rid of
    platform-specific mess, and do a straightforward type conversion
    between osi_timeval32_t and struct clock in an inline function.

    afs: Move osi_GetTime out of param.h
    
    Most platforms currently #define osi_GetTime in their param.h. This is
    really redundant, since the definition of osi_GetTime almost never
    changes for a given platform, so we end up with many copies of the
    same osi_GetTime definition for a given platform.
    
    Move osi_GetTime out of param.h for these platforms, and define it in
    osi_machdep.h instead, which is where most platform-specific
    definitions go.
    
    For DFBSD, we don't have an osi_machdep.h at all yet, so create a new
    one to contain the osi_GetTime definition. Currently we don't build
    libafs at all on DFBSD, but do this anyway so we don't lose the
    existing osi_GetTime definition.
    
    For NBSD, we were providing (conflicting!) definitions for osi_GetTime
    in param.h and in osi_machdep.h. Just remove the definitions in
    param.h, since those should have been getting overridden by the
    osi_machdep.h definition.

    UKERNEL: remove redundant declaration of osi_GetTime
    
    Commit c861bb0d779b54236b63eda87d9dfaf7792d1659 "Additional UKERNEL
    headers, prototyping and other fixes" added the following lines to
    src/rx/rx_prototypes.h:
    
      #if defined(UKERNEL) && !defined(osi_GetTime)
      extern int osi_GetTime(struct timeval *tv);
      #endif
    
    However, this appears to be redundant with the declaration in
    src/afs/afs_prototypes.h:
    
      #ifdef UKERNEL
      ...
      extern int osi_GetTime(struct timeval *tv);
      ...
      #endif
    
    which was added much earlier with commit
    8f2df21ffe59e9aa66219bf24656775b584c122d
    "pull-prototypes-to-head-20020821".
    
    Remove the redundant declaration in rx/rx_prototypes.h.

    Convert all osi_timeval_t to osi_timeval32_t
    
    Since commit 130144850c6d05bc69e06257a5d7219eb98697d8 "xstat: cm xstat
    time values are 32 bit", OpenAFS has had two timeval definitions:
    osi_timeval_t and osi_timeval32_t.  Since they are functionally
    equivalent, convert all references to osi_timeval_t to osi_timeval32_t.
    This makes clear that this struct is always expected to contain 32-bit
    members for tv_sec and tv_usec.
    
    There are still a few platforms where osi_timeval32_t is mistakenly
    defined with 64-bit members; these will be addressed in future commits.
    
    No functional change should be incurred by this commit.

    clang-10: use AFS_FALLTHROUGH for case fallthrough
    
    Clang-10 will not recognize '/* fallthrough */' as an indicator to
    turn off the fallthrough diagnostic due to the lack of a 'break' in a
    case statement.  Clang-10 requires the '__attribute__((fallthrough))'
    statement to disable the diagnostic.
    
    In addition clang-10 is finding additional locations where fall throughs
    occur.
    
    Determine if the compiler supports '__attribute__((fallthrough))' to
    disable the implicit fallthrough diagnostic.
    
    Define a new macro 'AFS_FALLTHROUGH' that will disable the fallthrough
    diagnostic. Set it as a wrapper for the Linux kernel's 'fallthrough'
    macro if available, otherwise set it as a wrapper macro for
    '__attribute__((fallthrough))' if the compiler supports it.
    
    Update CODING to document the use of AFS_FALLTHROUGH when needing to
    fallthrough between case statements.
    
    Replace the '/* fallthrough */' comments with AFS_FALLTHROUGH, and add
    AFS_FALLTHROUGH as needed.
    
    Replace some fallthroughs with a break (or goto) if the flow was was
    just to a break (or goto).
    
    e.g.   case x:                 case x:
               somestmt;               somestmt;
                                       break;
           case y:                 case y:
               break;                  break;
    
    Correct a mis-indented brace '}' in src/WINNT/afsd/smb3.c
    
    Note, the clang maintainers have rejected the use of comments as a flag
    to turn off the fall through warnings.

    Add more 'fall through' switch comments
    
    Commit a455452d (LINUX 5.3: Add comments for fallthrough switch cases)
    added the special /* fall through */ comment to various switch/case
    blocks, in order to avoid implicit-fallthrough warnings from causing
    the build to fail when building the Linux kernel module.
    
    In this commit, add additional /* fall through */ comments to the rest
    of the tree where falling through is intentional. Add a "break;" in one
    place in dumptool.c where falling through seems like a mistake, and flag
    certain functions as AFS_NORETURN to avoid needing to explicitly break
    or fallthrough.
    
    Check for the availability of the -Wimplicit-fallthrough compiler flag
    and use it when --enable-checking is set, to prevent additional cases
    from creeping into the tree.
    
    Note: the -Wimplicit-fallthrough compiler flag was added in gcc 7.

    vos: Properly print volume transaction flags
    
    Currently, the code in 'vos status' treats the 'iflags' and 'vflags'
    of a transaction like an enumerated type; that is, we only check if
    'iflags' is equal to ITOffline or ITBusy, etc. But both of these flags
    fields are bitfields; any combination of the relevant flags could
    theoretically be set.
    
    Practically speaking, we only ever set at most one of the flags in
    'iflags', but if anything ever did set more than one flag, our output
    would look broken (we'd print "attachFlags:" without any flags).
    
    For 'vflags', multiple flags are often set at once: the most common
    combination is VTDeleteOnSalvage|VTOutOfService. So currently, we
    usually print "attachFlags:" without any actual flags, since the
    'vflags' field isn't exactly equal to VTDeleteOnSalvage (instead it's
    set to VTDeleteOnSalvage|VTOutOfService). And if we ever did see just
    VTDeleteOnSalvage set by itself, the way the switch() cases fall
    through to each other, we'd print out that _all_ flags are set.
    
    To fix all of this, just test for the individual flag bits instead.

    autoconf: check for format __attribute__ to avoid warnings
    
    Building with Solaris Studio generates a ludicrous number of warnings
    in the form:
    
       roken.h, line ...: warning: attribute "format" is unknown, ignored
    
    Modern Solaris Studio supports several GCC-style function attributes,
    including the `noreturn' attribute, however does not support the
    `format' attribute.
    
    Currently, configure defines HAVE___ATTRIBUTE__ when the `noreturn'
    attribute is available. roken headers conditionally declare printf-like
    functions with the `format' function attribute when HAVE___ATTRIBUTE__
    is defined, leading to the warning messages when building under Solaris
    Studio. Unsupported function attributes generate warnings, not errors.
    
    Fix these warnings by defining HAVE___ATTRIBUTE__ if and only if the
    `format' attribute is supported by the compiler, instead of checking for
    `noreturn'.  Note that the `format' type is currently the only attribute
    used by roken at this time.

    Add autoconf-archive to src/external
    
    Add autoconf-archive to the src/external mechanism, so we can more
    easily import and update the AX_* m4 macros we pull in from
    autoconf-archive. Commits are imported from
    <git://git.savannah.gnu.org/autoconf-archive.git>.
    
    We already have a copy of ax_gcc_func_attribute.m4 in the tree, so
    include that in the list of files. While we're here, also include a
    few more macros for checking compiler flags, which will be used in
    subsequent commits.

commit fb767628e7249630b12f709a2af526be0dd133b9
Author: Andrew Deason <adeason@dson.org>

    FBSD: Use GENERIC kernel headers by default
    
    Currently, if --with-bsd-kernel-build is not specified during
    configure, we do not set KERNBUILDDIR during the libafs build at all.
    This means that we do not use an opt_global.h during the build.
    
    For the GENERIC kernel, in the past this has worked well enough to
    produce a working kernel module, but with FreeBSD 12, the GENERIC
    kernel turns on the VIMAGE option by default. If our kernel module is
    built without VIMAGE defined, our kernel module cannot be loaded into
    GENERIC, since VIMAGE changes the definitions of some symbols that we
    use (for example, trying to load such a libafs fails with the message
    "link_elf_obj: symbol in_ifaddrhead undefined").
    
    To allow the build to work by default for GENERIC kernels, without
    needing any additional configure flags, change the libafs Makefile to
    use the headers for the GENERIC kernel if no kernel build dir is
    given. To do this, we create a directory in our build tree and
    generate the opt_*.h headers in there (using config(8)), and specify
    that directory as the kernel build dir.
    
    This approach only works for GENERIC kernels, of course, but that is
    the most common scenario. Users that want to build for a custom kernel
    configuration still need to specify the actual kernel build dir with
    --with-bsd-kernel-build.

    FBSD: Avoid recursive osi_VM_StoreAllSegments lock
    
    Currently, osi_VM_StoreAllSegments calls vget() for the given vnode,
    which requires locking the vnode. However, the vnode should already be
    locked. For example, when called from the close syscall, we reach this
    function via: vn_close1 -> afs_vop_close -> afs_close ->
    afs_StoreOnLastReference -> afs_StoreAllSegments ->
    osi_VM_StoreAllSegments. This causes a panic like so:
    
        kernel: panic: lockmgr_xlock_hard: recursing on non recursive lockmgr 0x[...] @ /usr/src/sys/kern/vfs_subr.c:2730
    
    We can also reach this code path from the BOP_STORE background
    operation (BStore -> afs_StoreOnLastReference -> afs_StoreAllSegments
    -> osi_VM_StoreAllSegments), initiated from afs_close(), which has the
    vnode locked. In this case, we won't be recursively locking the vnode,
    since the process calling afs_close() is the one that holds the lock,
    and the background thread is the process trying to lock the vnode
    again. So we'll just deadlock.
    
    From the comments in this function, it seems like locking the vnode at
    all in here is unnecessary, since the vnode should be locked from the
    higher-level functions anyway. So just skip the vget and all of the
    related looping retry logic. As a result, this function can now become
    somewhat simplified.

    this results in 'make' trying to build '%.c', which of course we
    cannot do, since that's a pattern rule, and so 'make' fails.
    
    To fix this, just 'make all' explicitly, to make the intended targets
    in src/dir/test.

    build: declare test targets as phony
    
    Modern versions `make` will not build the 'test' target since a
    directory exists with the same name.
    
        $ grep -C1 '^test:' Makefile
        test:
            cd test; $(MAKE)
    
        $ make test
        make: 'test' is up to date.
    
    Declare these targets as .PHONY to force make to build the test programs
    even when the 'test' directory is present. Also use '&&' to concatenate
    commands instead ';' to avoid running the second command when the first
    fails.

    rx: Remove delays in multi_End_Ignore
    
    When using our multi_Rx mechanism, callers can use either multi_End or
    multi_End_Ignore at the end of the multi_Rx block. Among other things,
    these macros run 'rx_EndCall(call, code)' for each call in the
    multi_Rx invocation that hasn't already ended. For multi_End, 'code'
    is RX_USER_ABORT, and for multi_End_Ignore, 'code' is 0; the macros
    are otherwise equivalent.
    
    When multi_End is used, this means any un-ended calls are aborted with
    RX_USER_ABORT, and the call immediately ends. But when
    multi_End_Ignore is used, the call is not aborted, and so we must wait
    for the peer to acknowledge that it has received our packets before
    ending (done via an rxi_ReadProc call in rx_EndCall).
    
    This means that if a caller multi_Abort's out of a multi call and uses
    multi_End_Ignore, we'll wait for the peer to acknowledge our packets
    for all of the calls we haven't processed. Waiting for that is a
    complete waste of time, since we don't care about the results of those
    calls (since we multi_Abort'd). This doesn't matter much if those
    calls are responded to promptly, but if the peer is not up or is just
    slow, it can cause us to wait several seconds until we timeout.
    
    There are currently only three users of multi_End_Ignore:
    
    - DoProbe in src/ubik/recovery.c
    
    - MultiBreakCallBackAlternateAddress_r in src/viced/callback.c
    
    - MultiProbeAlternateAddress_r in src/viced/callback.c
    
    All of these use multi_Rx to try and probe multiple IPs for the same
    machine in parallel, and so some of the calls may very well be trying
    to contact unreachable IPs; we only need one to work for the call to
    succeed.
    
    To avoid the unnecessary delays in these codepaths, convert them to
    use multi_End. Change multi_End_Ignore to be the same as multi_End,
    and multi_Finalize_Ignore to the same as multi_Finalize, to make sure
    the bad behavior is not used. The _Ignore macros/functions are now
    unused in the tree, but keep them around for now since
    multi_Finalize_Ignore is exported by libafsrpc.
    
    Thanks to mbarbosa@sinenomine.net for discovering this weird behavior.

    fs: Avoid unnecessary cell DNS lookups
    
    Currently, many routines in 'fs' cause afsconf_GetCellInfo to be
    called for the given cell, which causes an AFSDB/SRV lookup for the
    given cell if the cell has no dbservers specified in the local
    CellServDB. Sites often define such CellServDB records to indicate
    that the given cell exists, but the dbserver IPs should only be looked
    up via DNS.
    
    However, 'fs' is only calling afsconf_GetCellInfo in order to
    canonicalize the cell name (we're allowed to give an abbreviated name
    for a cell on the command line if the abbreviation is unambiguous, but
    we want to give the full name to the kernel). We don't care about the
    other cell info at all, so triggering a DNS lookup is completely
    unnecessary.
    
    If our DNS server is not responding, e.g. because we've lost network
    access entirely, this causes the relevant 'fs' commands to fail,
    possibly after a long delay. Some fs commands such as 'fs setcell' are
    often run during client startup, and can still otherwise run fine
    without network access, and so such failures are unnecessary.
    
    To fix this, we introduce a new function, called afsconf_GetCellName,
    which only returns the full name for a cell, and does not require a
    DNS lookup for such "empty" cells in the local CellServDB. For all
    code paths in 'fs' that just need the cell name (which is all of them
    besides 'fs mkmount'), use this new function.

    afs: clarify cold and warm shutdown logic
    
    Currently, any code that wants to perform a cold shutdown must first set
    global afs_cold_shutdown = 1, then call afs_shutdown(void).
    
    Instead, modify afs_shutdown() to accept a single parm which specifies
    AFS_WARM or AFS_COLD shutdown, and to set the value of global
    afs_cold_shutdown based on this parm.  Remove all other assignments for
    afs_cold_shutdown.  Modify all callers of afs_shutdown() to specify
    AFS_WARM or AFS_COLD as needed to maintain equivalent function.
    
    This should make it much easier to tell at a glance what type of
    shutdown is being requested by each caller to afs_shutdown().
    
    No functional change should be incurred by this commit.

    warn when starting without keys
    
    The server processes will happily start without keys and then fail all
    authenticated access, including database synchronization and local
    commands with -localauth.  At least issue warnings to let admins know
    the keys are missing and that akeyconvert or asetkey needs to be run.
    
    The situation is not helped by fact the filenames of the key files have
    changed between versions. In 1.6.x the (non-DES) keys were in the
    rxkad.keytab file and in later versions they are in the KeyFile* files,
    so if you are used to 1.6.x it is not obvious what is wrong.

    autoconf: Remove/update obsolete autoconf macros
    
    Autoconf 2.70 (released in 2020-12) produces warning messages about
    obsolete constructs by default.
    
    Running regen.sh with autoconf 2.70 installed produces the following
    warnings:
    
    ..
     configure.ac:7: warning: The macro `AC_CONFIG_HEADER' is obsolete.
     configure.ac:21: warning: AC_PROG_LEX without either yywrap or noyywrap
       is obsolete
     configure.ac:21: warning: The macro `AC_HEADER_STDC' is obsolete.
     configure.ac:21: warning: The macro `AC_HEADER_TIME' is obsolete.
    ..
    
    Replace AC_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS
    
    Add the noyywrap parameter to AC_PROG_LEX.  Use the noyywrap option
    since we already provide a yywrap function in the .l sources.
    
    Remove AC_HEADER_STDC.  There are no references to the the autoconf
    variable set by this macro.  This macro was marked as obsolete prior to
    autoconf 2.64 with the following note:
     "This macro is obsolescent, as current systems have conforming header
     files. New programs need not use this macro."
    
    AC_HEADER_TIME was marked as obsolete prior to autoconf 2.64 with the
    following note:
     "This macro is obsolescent, as current systems can include both files
      when they exist. New programs need not use this macro."
    
    The only reference that requires AC_HEADER_TIME is within the external
    roken code pulled from heimdal. Compiles that use the external upstream
    heimdal packages result in a build error if TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is not
    defined:
      building src/crypto/hcrypto
        src/external/heimdal/hcrypto/camellia.c
          include/roken.h:803:58: error: ‘struct tm’ declared inside
    
    Update autoheader.m4 so a define for TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is created. This
    avoids modifying the external heimdal/roken code.

    DARWIN: remove vestigial etap_event_t typedefs
    
    These typedefs have been present since commit
    a41175cfbbf4d06ccfe14ae54bef8b7464ecd80b
    "initial-darwin-support-20010327"; at least some of this material was
    obtained directly from IBM after the initial code import.
    
    Based on research of old Darwin source code and kernel documentation,
    the Event Trace Analysis Package (ETAP) was a lock-profiling interface
    provided in older versions of Mach and xnu.  ETAP was not enabled by
    default; the kernel had to be recompiled with certain options to enable
    it.  Support for ETAP was removed from the xnu tree sometime between
    xnu-517 (10.3 Panther) and xnu-792 (10.4 Tiger), although some
    references remain in the latter under PPC support (osfmk/ppc/hw_lock.s).
    All remaining references to etap_event_t disappeared when PPC support
    was removed, some time between xnu-1456.1.26 (10.6 Snow Leopard) and
    xnu-1699.24.8 (10.7.2 Lion).
    
    Therefore, it is possible that these typedefs were needed in the past by
    (IBM/Transarc) AFS to support use of some lock APIs (e.g.,
    simple_lock_init, usimple_lock_init) after the ETAP code was withdrawn
    from xnu.  However, these typedefs have probably always been vestigial
    for OpenAFS, because OpenAFS has never used any lock API that took
    etap_event_t as an argument.
    
    Regardless, OpenAFS does not need these definitions to build and run on
    any currently supported version of macOS.
    
    Remove the vestigial code.
    
    No functional change should be incurred by this commit.

    afs: Handle osi_NewVnode failures
    
    Currently, code inside afs_vcache.c assumes that osi_NewVnode always
    returns non-NULL, which means that osi_NewVnode must panic if it
    cannot create a new vnode.
    
    All of the callers of afs_GetVCache, afs_NewVCache, etc, already
    handle getting a NULL return, though (after all, the given fid may not
    exist or be inaccessible due to network errors, etc). So, just
    propagate NULL returns from osi_NewVnode up to our callers, to avoid
    panics in these situations.
    
    Modify osi_NewVnode on many arches to return an error on allocation
    failure, instead of panic'ing.

    rx: remove rx_atomic bitops
    
    The rx_atomic bitops were introduced with commit
    1839cdbe268f4b19ac8e81ae78548f5c78e0c641 ("rx: atomic bit ops").
    
    The last (only) reference to them was recently removed with commit
    5ced6025b9f11fadbdf2e092bf40cc87499ed277 ("rx: Convert rxinit_status to
    rx_IsRunning()").
    
    Remove the now unreferenced bitops.  This commit is comprised of partial
    or complete reverts of the following commits:
    
    ae4ad509d35 rx: fix rx_atomic warnings under Solaris (partial)
    c16423ec4e6 rx: fix atomics on darwin (partial)
    9dc6dd9858a rx: Fix AIX test_and_set_bit (complete)
    1839cdbe268 rx: atomic bit ops (complete)
    
    Note: The rx_atomic bitops for Linux systems are known to be broken due
    to incorrect casting of rx_atomic_t into the unsigned long operand
    expected by the native Linux bitops.  The failure modes include silent
    overruns on little-endian and incorrect results on big-endian.  Do not
    merely revert this commit in order to bring these bitops back into the
    tree.
