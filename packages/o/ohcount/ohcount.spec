%description
Ohcount counts lines of source code. It supports over 70 programming
languages, and has been used to count over 6 billion lines of code by
300,000 developers. Ohcount can also detect open source licenses such
as GPL within a large directory of source code. It can further detect
code that targets a particular programming API, such as Win32 or KDE.
