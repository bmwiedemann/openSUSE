- Renamed the 'forward' man page to resolve conflict with an existing
  Factory package (vacation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 13 15:45:33 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Added patches according to feedback from boo#1247781:
  * OpenSMTPD-reduced-permissions-on-SMTPD_SOCKET.patch: control socket
    permissions have been removed for world
  * OpenSMTPD-simplified-world-writable-spoolers-handling.patch: simplified
    world-writable spool handling. Changes from upstream have been imported
    before the next upstream version is released. Once it is released, this
    patch can be removed
  * permissions on /var/spool/mail were set to 755 which means server
    operator is expected to add relevant users to a group and adjust
    the mentioned directory's ownership and permissions appropriately

- Updated the spec file according to feedback from boo#1247781:
  * the package takes ownership of /var/spool/mail like other
    packages that provide smtp_daemon (see discussion in
    https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/pull/1392)
  * set_permissions/verify_permissions have been configured. At 
    this moment (before package allowlisting), this causes rpmlint
    errors which is by design

- Further hardened the systemd service configuration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 28 09:22:32 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Updated the spec file so that default configuration works out of
  the box. The workaround is related to the issue as described in
  https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/issues/853

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  7 10:40:54 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Updated the spec file according to feedback:
  * added the Provides and Conflicts sections
  * changed the 'sed' expression to appear more traditional

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  7 09:48:53 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Removed the rpmlintrc file. 'permissions-file-setuid-bit' requires
  review from the security team. Without the rpmlint allowlisting the
  package build is broken.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug  7 07:55:52 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Updated the spec file according to feedback:
  * included upstream source URL and uploaded the result of 'download_files'
    service manual run directly to OBS
  * switched to pkgconfig for library build dependency resolution
  * normalized to OpenSSL for all targets due to compilation issues with
    LibreSSL for Tumbleweed on armv7l
  * applied 'format_spec_file' service edits
  * switched to using macros for 'make' 'build' and 'install'
  * switched to using a macro for lowercase variant of the package name
    instead of hardcoding it, where applicable
  * removed 'strip' invocations because it breaks debuginfo packages; it
    is assumed OBS will strip binaries for release configuration
  * started depending on 'netcfg' package to provide /etc/aliases
  * removed '%attr' specification on '%files' where 'make install' does it
    well by default
  * removed rc symlink fix for rpmlint 'suse-missing-rclink' warning (no
    longer needed)
  * removed permissions.d specification; the package has only one permission
    configuration set

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  2 14:55:09 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Updated the package to upstream version 7.7.0p0 (2025-05-12) that brings
  the following significant change:
  * updated to use imsg APIs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 30 15:50:03 UTC 2025 - Mislav Bozicevic <mislav.bozicevic@suse.com>

- Initial experimental build for version 7.6.0p1 (2024-10-20) that was not
  packaged and released beyond the home project.
