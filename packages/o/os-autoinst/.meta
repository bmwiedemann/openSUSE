  <title>OS-level test automation</title>
  <description>The OS-autoinst project aims at providing a means to run fully
automated tests. Especially to run tests of basic and low-level
operating system components such as bootloader, kernel, installer
and upgrade, which can not easily and safely be tested with other
automated testing frameworks. However, it can just as well be used
to test firefox and openoffice operation on top of a newly
installed OS.</description>
