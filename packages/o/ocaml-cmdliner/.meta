  <title>Declarative definition of command line interfaces for OCaml</title>
  <description>Cmdliner is a module for the declarative definition of command line interfaces.

It provides a simple and compositional mechanism to convert command line
arguments to OCaml values and pass them to your functions. The module
automatically handles syntax errors, help messages and UNIX man page
generation. It supports programs with single or multiple commands and respects
most of the POSIX and GNU conventions.

Cmdliner is made of a single independent module and distributed under the BSD3 license.
