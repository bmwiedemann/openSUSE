  <description>The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted blocks of example code within documentation files. It then executes the code and confirms the output is correct. This can be useful as part of a testing framework or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date during software development.
This is part of Octave-Forge project.</description>
