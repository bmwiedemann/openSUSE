- Update to version 0.6.1:
  * Workaround regex bug on ARM (again!).
- Changes from version 0.6.0:
  * Tests can now call "clear" and "clear all".
  * Fixes for running on Octave development versions (upcoming
    4.4.0).
  * Minimum supported Octave version is now 4.2.0.  The package no
    longer has any compiled code and does not include an "evalc"
    implementation.
- Update Requires: octave-cli > 4.2.0 is now required.
- Update file list: pkg no longer installs to libdir.
- BuildArch: noarch because pkg no longer installs arch dependent
  binaries.
- Untar tarball in build dir before running checks.
