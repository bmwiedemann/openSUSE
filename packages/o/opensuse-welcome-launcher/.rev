    <comment>- Change autostart to always launch, but internally decide if we
  already showed the greeter. This allows us to bump the version
  for next Leap versions and have the welcome screen show at least
  once every while.

- Ensure ${HOME}/.config/autostart exists before copying to it
  (boo#1248197).
- Install autostart to /usr/etc/xdg/autosttart
- Build as noarch: this package only consists of a shell script.

- For the transition period let's limit scope to executing
  opensuse-welcome. For the time being make
  opensuse-welcome recommended as we replace it in pattern-base.
- Use Hidden=True for .config/autostart
  Introduce org.opensuse.opensuse_welcome_launcher-hidden.desktop
- Remove legacy org.opensuse.opensuse_welcome.desktop
  from .config/autostart now when it was dropped from
  opensuse-welcome
- Add svg files from opensuse-welcome for icon reference in
  .desktop files. Also adds Buildrequires on hicolor icons
- Related to code-o-o#leap/features/208</comment>
