Tue Oct  7 16:33:55 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.32.0:
  - Incompatible changes
    - Removed support for daemons and clients older than Nix 2.0
      [#13951] We have dropped support in the daemon worker
      protocol for daemons and clients that don't speak at least
      version 18 of the protocol. This first Nix release that
      supports this version is Nix 2.0, released in February 2018.
    - Derivation JSON format now uses store path basenames only
      [#13570] [#13980] Experience with many JSON frameworks (e.g.
      nlohmann/json in C++, Serde in Rust, and Aeson in Haskell)
      has shown that the use of the store directory in JSON formats
      is an impediment to systematic JSON formats, because it
      requires the serializer/deserializer to take an extra
      paramater (the store directory). We ultimately want to
      rectify this issue with all JSON formats to the extent
      allowed by our stability promises. To start with, we are
      changing the JSON format for derivations because the `nix
      derivation` commands are — in addition to being formally
      unstable — less widely used than other unstable commands. See
      the documentation on the JSON format for derivations for
      further details.
    - C API: `nix_get_attr_name_byidx`, `nix_get_attr_byidx` take a
      `nix_value *` instead of `const nix_value *` [#13987] In
      order to accommodate a more optimized internal representation
      of attribute set merges these functions require a mutable
      `nix_value *` that might be modified on access. This does
      *not* break the ABI of these functions.
  - New features
    - C API: Add lazy attribute and list item accessors [#14030]
      The C API now includes lazy accessor functions for retrieving
      values from lists and attribute sets without forcing
      evaluation:
      - `nix_get_list_byidx_lazy()` - Get a list element without
        forcing its evaluation
      - `nix_get_attr_byname_lazy()` - Get an attribute value by
        name without forcing evaluation
      - `nix_get_attr_byidx_lazy()` - Get an attribute by index
        without forcing evaluation
      These functions are useful when forwarding unevaluated
      sub-values to other lists, attribute sets, or function calls.
      They allow more efficient handling of Nix values by deferring
      evaluation until actually needed. Additionally, bounds
      checking has been improved for all `_byidx` functions to
      properly validate indices before access, preventing potential
      out-of-bounds errors. The documentation for `NIX_ERR_KEY`
      error handling has also been clarified to specify when this
      error code is returned.
    - HTTP binary caches now support transparent compression for
      metadata HTTP binary cache stores can now compress
      `.narinfo`, `.ls`, and build log files before uploading them,
      reducing bandwidth usage and storage requirements. The
      compression is applied transparently using the
      `Content-Encoding` header, allowing compatible clients to
      automatically decompress the files.
      Three new configuration options control this behavior:
      - `narinfo-compression`: Compression method for `.narinfo`
        files
      - `ls-compression`: Compression method for `.ls` files
      - `log-compression`: Compression method for build logs in
        `log/` directory

      Example usage:
      ```
      nix copy --to 'http://cache.example.com?narinfo-compression=gzip&ls-compression=gzip' /nix/store/...
      nix store copy-log --to 'http://cache.example.com?log-compression=br' /nix/store/...
      ```
    - Temporary build directories no longer include derivation
      names [#13839]
      Temporary build directories created during derivation builds
      no longer include the derivation name in their path to avoid
      build failures when the derivation name is too long. This
      change ensures predictable prefix lengths for build
      directories under `/nix/var/nix/builds`.
    - External derivation builders [#14145]
      These are helper programs that Nix calls to perform
      derivations for specified system types, e.g. by using QEMU to
      emulate a different type of platform. For more information,
      see the `external-builders` setting. This is currently an
      experimental feature.
  - Performance improvements
    - Optimize memory usage of attribute set merges [#13987]
      Attribute set update operations have been optimized to reduce
      reallocations in cases when the second operand is small. For
      typical evaluations of nixpkgs this optimization leads to
      ~20% less memory allocated in total without significantly
      affecting evaluation performance. See
      eval-attrset-update-layer-rhs-threshold
    - Substituted flake inputs are no longer re-copied to the store
      [#14041]
      Since 2.25, Nix would fail to store a cache entry for
      substituted flake inputs, which in turn would cause them to
      be re-copied to the store on initial evaluation. Caching
      these inputs results in a near doubling of performance in
      some cases — especially on I/O-bound machines and when using
      commands that fetch many inputs, like `nix flake
      [archive|prefetch-inputs]`.
    - `nix flake check` now skips derivations that can be
      substituted [#13574]
      Previously, `nix flake check` would evaluate and
      build/substitute all derivations. Now, it will skip
      downloading derivations that can be substituted. This can
      drastically decrease the time invocations take in
      environments where checks may already be cached (like in CI).
    - `fetchTarball` and `fetchurl` now correctly substitute (#14138)
      At some point we stopped substituting calls to `fetchTarball`
      and `fetchurl` with a set `narHash` to avoid incorrectly
      substituting things in `fetchTree`, even though it would be
      safe to substitute when calling the legacy
      `fetch{Tarball,url}`. This fixes that regression where it is
      safe.
    - Started moving AST allocations into a bump allocator [#14088]
      This leaves smaller, immutable structures in the AST. So far
      this saves about 2% memory on a NixOS config evaluation.

Thu Sep 18 13:04:51 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.31.2:
  - Temporary build directories created during derivation builds no
    longer include the derivation name in their path to avoid build

    `/nix/var/nix/builds`

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 25 08:58:05 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.31.0:
  - `build-cores = 0` now auto-detects CPU cores
    [#13402](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13402) When
    `build-cores` is set to `0`, Nix now automatically detects the
    number of available CPU cores and passes this value via
    `NIX_BUILD_CORES`, instead of passing `0` directly. This
    matches the behavior when `build-cores` is unset. This prevents
    the builder from having to detect the number of cores.
  - Fix Git LFS SSH issues
    [#13337](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/13337)
    [#13743](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13743) Fixed some
    outstanding issues with Git LFS and SSH.
    - Added support for `NIX_SSHOPTS`.
    - Properly use the parsed port from URL.
    - Better use of the response of `git-lfs-authenticate` to
      determine API endpoint when the API is not exposed on port
      443.
  - Add support for `user@address:port` syntax in store URIs
    [#7044](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7044)
    [#3425](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/3425) It's now
    possible to specify the port used for SSH stores directly in
    the store URL in accordance with
    [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).
    Previously the only way to specify custom ports was via
    `ssh_config` or the `NIX_SSHOPTS` environment variable, because
    Nix incorrectly passed the port number together with the host
    name to the SSH executable. This change affects [store
    references](@docroot@/store/types/index.md#store-url-format)
    passed via the `--store` and similar flags in CLI as well as in
    the configuration for [remote
    builders](@docroot@/command-ref/conf-file.md#conf-builders).
    For example, the following store URIs now work:
    - `ssh://127.0.0.1:2222`
    - `ssh://[b573:6a48:e224:840b:6007:6275:f8f7:ebf3]:22`
    - `ssh-ng://[b573:6a48:e224:840b:6007:6275:f8f7:ebf3]:22`
  - Represent IPv6 RFC4007 ZoneId literals in conformance with
    RFC6874 [#13445](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13445) Prior
    versions of Nix since
    [#4646](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/4646) accepted [IPv6
    scoped
    addresses](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4007) in
    URIs like [store
    references](@docroot@/store/types/index.md#store-url-format) in
    the textual representation with a literal percent character:
    `[fe80::1%18]`. This was ambiguous, because the the percent
    literal `%` is reserved by
    [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), since
    it's used to indicate percent encoding. Nix now requires that
    the percent `%` symbol is percent-encoded as `%25`. This
    implements
    [RFC6874](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6874), which
    defines the representation of zone identifiers in URIs. The
    example from above now has to be specified as `[fe80::1%2518]`.
  - Use WAL mode for SQLite cache databases
    [#13800](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13800) Previously,
    Nix used SQLite's "truncate" mode for caches. However, this
    could cause a Nix process to block if another process was
    updating the cache. This was a problem for the flake evaluation
    cache in particular, since it uses long-running transactions.
    Thus, concurrent Nix commands operating on the same flake could
    be blocked for an unbounded amount of time. WAL mode avoids
    this problem. This change required updating the versions of the
    SQLite caches. For instance, `eval-cache-v5.sqlite` is now
    `eval-cache-v6.sqlite`.
  - Enable parallel marking in bdwgc
    [#13708](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13708) Previously
    marking was done by only one thread, which takes a long time if
    the heap gets big. Enabling parallel marking speeds up
    evaluation a lot, for example (on a Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core):
    - `nix search nixpkgs` from 24.3s to 18.9s.
    - Evaluating the `NixOS/nix/2.21.2` flake regression test from
      86.1s to 71.2s.
  - New command `nix flake prefetch-inputs`
    [#13565](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13565) This command
    fetches all inputs of a flake in parallel. This can be a lot
    faster than the serialized on-demand fetching during regular
    flake evaluation. The downside is that it may fetch inputs that
    aren't normally used.
  - Add `warn-short-path-literals` setting
    [#13489](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13489) This setting,
    when enabled, causes Nix to emit warnings when encountering
    relative path literals that don't start with `.` or `/`, for
    instance suggesting that `foo/bar` should be rewritten to
    `./foo/bar`.
  - When updating a lock, respect the input's lock file
    [#13437](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13437) For example,
    if a flake has a lock for `a` and `a/b`, and we change the
    flakeref for `a`, previously Nix would fetch the latest version
    of `b` rather than using the lock for `b` from `a`.
  - Implement support for Git hashing with SHA-256
    [#13543](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13543) The
    experimental support for
    [Git-hashing](@docroot@/development/experimental-features.md#xp-feature-git-hashing)
    store objects now also includes support for SHA-256, not just
    SHA-1, in line with upstream Git.

- Update to 2.30.1:
  - minor bug fix release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  8 16:14:34 UTC 2025 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- Update to 2.30.0:
  ## Backward-incompatible changes and deprecations

  - build-dir  longer defaults to  $TMPDIR The directory in which
    temporary build directories are created no longer defaults to
    TMPDIR  or  /tmp , to avoid builders making their directories
    world-accessible. This behavior allowed escaping the build
    sandbox and can cause build impurities even when not used
    maliciously. We now default to builds in  NIX_STATE_DIR  (which
    is  /nix/var/nix/builds  in the default configuration).
  - Deprecate manually making structured attrs using the  __json
    attribute #13220 https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13220The
    proper way to create a derivation using structured attrs in the
    Nix language is by using  __structuredAttrs = true  with
    builtins. derivation

    However, by exploiting how structured attrs are implementated,
    it has also been possible to create them by setting the  __json
    environment variable to a serialized JSON string. This sneaky
    alternative method is now deprecated, and may be disallowed in
    future versions of Nix.
  - Rename  nix profile install  to  nix profile add #13224
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13224 The command  nix
    profile install  has been renamed to  nix profile add (though
    the former is still available as an alias). This is because the
    verb "add" is a better antonym for the verb "remove" (i.e.  nix
    profile remove ). Nix also does not have install hooks or
    general behavior often associated with "installing".

  ## Performance improvements

  This release has a number performance improvements, in particular:

  - Reduce the size of value from 24 to 16 bytes #13407
    https://github. com/NixOS/nix/pull/13407 This shaves off a very
    significant amount of memory used for evaluation (~20% percent
    reduction in maximum heap size and ~17% in total bytes).

  ## Features

  - Add stack sampling evaluation profiler #13220 https://github.
    com/NixOS/nix/pull/13220 The Nix evaluator now supports stack
    sampling evaluation profiling via the  --eval-profiler
    flamegraph setting. It outputs collapsed call stack information
    to the file specified by --eval-profile-file ( nix. profile  by
    default) in a format directly consumable by  flamegraph.pl  and
    compatible tools like speedscope https://speedscope. app/.
    Sampling frequency can be configured via
    --eval-profiler-frequency (99 Hz by default).Unlike the
    existing  --trace-function-calls this profiler includes the
    name of the function being called when it's available.
  - nix repl
    prints which variables were loaded #11406
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/11406Instead of  Added <n>
    variables  it now prints the first 10 variables that were added
    to the global scope.
  - nix flake archive : Add  --no-check-sigs
    option #13277 https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13277This is
    useful when using  nix flake archive with the destination set
    to a remote store.
  - Emit warnings for IFDs with  trace-import-from-derivation
    option #13279 https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13279While we
    have the setting  allow-import-from-derivation
    to deny import-from-derivation (IFD), sometimes users would
    like to observe IFDs during CI processes to gradually phase out
    the idiom. The new setting trace-import-from-derivation , when
    set, logs a simple warning to the console.
  - json-log-path  setting #13003
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/13003New setting
    json-log-path that sends a copy of all Nix log messages (in
    JSON format) to a file or Unix domain socket.
  - Non-flake inputs now contain a  sourceInfo  attribute #13164
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/13164 #13170
    https://github. com/NixOS/nix/pull/13170Flakes have always had
    a  sourceInfo  attribute which describes the source of the
    flake. The  sourceInfo.outPath  is often identical to the
    flake's  outPath . However, it can differ when the flake is
    located in a subdirectory of its source.Non-flake inputs (i.e.
    inputs with  flake = false inputs) can also be located at some
    path within a wider source. This usually happens when defining
    a relative path input within the same source as the parent
    flake, e.g.  inputs.foo.url = ./some-file.nix . Such relative
    inputs will now inherit their parent's  sourceInfo .This also
    means it is now possible to use ?dir=subdir  on non-flake
    inputs.This iterates on the work done in 2.26 to improve
    relative path support (#10089
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/10089), and resolves a
    regression introduced in 2.28 relating to nested relative path
    inputs (#13164 https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/13164).

  ## Miscellaneous changes

  - builtins.sort uses PeekSort #12623
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12623Previously it used
    libstdc++'s std::stable_sort() . However, that implementation
    is not reliable if the user-supplied comparison function is not
    a strict weak ordering.
  - Revert incomplete closure mixed download and build feature #77
    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/77 #12628 https://github.
    com/NixOS/nix/issues/12628 #13176 https://github.
    com/NixOS/nix/pull/13176 Since Nix 1.3 (commit  299141e in
    2013) Nix has attempted to mix together upstream fresh
    builds and downstream substitutions when remote substuters
    contain an "incomplete closure" (have some store objects, but
    not the store objects they reference). This feature is now
    removed.In the worst case, removing this feature could cause
    more building downstream, but it should not cause outright
    failures, since this is not happening for opaque store objects
    that we don't know how to build if we decide not to substitute.
    In practice, however, we doubt even more building is very
    likely to happen. Remote stores that are missing dependencies
    in arbitrary ways (e.g. corruption) don't seem to be very
    common.On the contrary, when remote stores fail to implement
    the closure property it is usually an intentional choice on the
    part of the remote store, because it wishes to serve as an
    "overlay" store over another store, such as
    https://cache.nixos. org . If an "incomplete closure" is
    encountered in that situation, the right fix is not to do some
    sort of "franken-building" as this feature implemented, but
    instead to make sure both substituters are enabled in the
    settings.(In the future, we should make it easier for remote
    stores to indicate this to clients, to catch settings that
    won't work in general before a missing dependency is actually
    encountered.)
