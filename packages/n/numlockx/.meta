  <title>Switch on/off or toggle numlock</title>
  <description>This little thingy allows you to start X with NumLock turned on ( which
is a feature that a lot of people seem to miss and nobody really knew
how to achieve this ). This code relies on X extensions called XTest
and XKB, so you need to have at least one of these X extensions
installed ( you most probably do ).</description>
