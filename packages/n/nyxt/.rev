    <comment>Nyxt is an innovative and extensible web browser written in Common Lisp.
It is in heavy development and v3.0.0 was just released after 2 years of work.
I maintained a git build in my home repo for 1 year during this time and would like to submit and maintain the stable version to Factory.

I already submitted it 1 month ago but it was rejected because of dynamically loading .so issues: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1087966

These issues are now fixed with a patch, hence this new submission.</comment>
