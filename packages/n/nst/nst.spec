%description
The not (so) simple terminal emulator. It is a C++ port of st, the simple
terminal emulator for X that sucks less. Apart from a modernized code base
nst offers builtin scrollback buffer support, enhanced smart selection
features and the possibility to process the terminal buffer history in
external tools for searching.
