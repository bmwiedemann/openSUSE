  <title>The Nagios Network Monitor</title>
  <description>Nagios is a program that will monitor hosts and services on your
network. It has the ability to email or page you when a problem arises
and when a problem is resolved. Nagios is written in C and is designed
to run under Linux (and some other *NIX variants) as a background
process, intermittently running checks on various services that you
specify.

The actual service checks are performed by separate &quot;plugin&quot; programs
which return the status of the checks to Nagios. The plugins are
available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug

This package provide core programs for nagios. The web interface,
documentation, and development files are built as separate packages
