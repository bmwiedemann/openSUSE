  * Added consuming `DType::into_factors`, removing need for mutable access to factors Changed `from_factors` to take an owned `Vec`

  * Merge pull request #566 from Bzero/example_decorator
  * Merge branch 'master' into example_decorator
  * More compact examples
  * Make tests use different values on the right side instead of the left of asserts
  * Shrunk `TokenKind` from 16 bytes to 2 by replacing `IntegerWithBase(usize)` with `IntegerWithBase(u8)` (max base is 16, no way do we exceed 255) Removed Box from base-n digit predicate function by switching to function pointers
  * Improved completion performance Removed non-matching candidates from consideration earlier, obviating need to filter them out Removed clones of candidates that didn't match (before: clone then check; after: check then clone)
  * Comment
  * Replaced many `String`s in `typed_ast::Expression` with `&'a str` (generally anywhere we could borrow from the input)
  * Borrowed name in `typed_ast::Statement::DefineDimension`
  * Borrowed type parameter names in `typed_ast::Statement::DefineFunction`

  * Code cleanup reducing clones (in theory)
  * Minor code cleanup
  * Formatting
  * Deduped some code

  * Add 'tau' alias for 'τ', closes #581
  * Update mixed-unit tests
  * Add comparison with other calculators/languages

  * Apply suggested example formatting
  * Remove example for the time function
  * Move details closing tag inside conditional
  * Expand documentation by adding examples
  * Automatically add examples to the documentation
  * Add @examples decorator
  * Replaced `ByteIndex::start()` with `ByteIndex(0)` --- now that it's just an index, `0` is clearer than `start` (which made sense when there was other data beyond just the current byte)
  * Renamed `SourceCodePositition` [sic] to `ByteIndex` to make its semantics clearer (it really is just a byte index into a string, nothing more nothing less)
  * Removed `line` and `position` from `SourceCodePositition` [sic] Made it a tuple struct instead; now it is just a wrapper over a byte index This was... surprisingly simple? turns out `line` and `position` weren't used anywhere but tests; they're never surfaced to the user
  * Add lowercase aliases for currency units
  * Dimensionful abs function
  * Update plotly to 0.10
  * Replaced `CommandKind::new` with `impl FromStr for CommandKind` (isomorphic but more self-descriptive)
  * Removed `ls` as alias for command `list` in web version for consistency with CLI Updated web docs
  * Updated cli docs
  * Restored accidentatlly removed alias `?` for `help`
  * Moved `writeln!` arg into format string
  * Replaced boolean `errored` with isomorphic but clearer `Result<(), ()>` and renamed some items accordingly
  * Boxed `NumbatError`
  * Factored out common components of `evaluate_const_expr`
  * boxed the errors to reduce size of `Result<T, BigError>`
  * Moved pushing to session history out of `parse_and_evaluate` and into `run_repl` Therefore changed `parse_and_evalute` to return a struct of `control_flow, errored` to let session history know whether the command in question errored Added tests to `session_history.rs` Code seems overall not terrible now
  * Renamed session history file to history.nbt
  * Simplified history implementation, at the cost of one allocation when reading prelude
  * Moved `session_history` storage from `Cli::repl` into `Cli::repl_loop`
  * Initial, simple implementation of saving per-session history
  * Update to official repo
  * Enable tests to run without internet access
  * Fix WASM tests
  * Consolidated duplicated code in `TypeChecker::elaborate_define_variable` and the `ast::Statement::DefineDerivedUnit` branch of `TypeChecker::elaborate_statement`
  * Removed clone of `ctx.dimension_registry()` (requires an additional `self.context.lock()` as the lock must be dropped to allow `self` to be borrowed in the interm)
  * Fixed inadvertently removed trailing whitespaces whose removal broke tests
  * Fixed a handful of clippy "needless `&` on `&str`" warnings
  * Removed pointless `.into()` on `&'static str` into itself
  * Renamed arg for clarity
  * Fixed semantically incorrect use of `char::len_utf8` (although it was used on a newline and would've had no effect, it is semantically correct to keep the original `+= 1`)
  * Removed `// todo` comment (we did the todo)
  * Replaced the `String` in `Token` with `&'a str` Unfortunately due to borrow checker limitations, this required moving `input` fields out of both `Parser` and `Tokenizer`, as with the immutable borrow in place, there is no way to tell Rust that a mutable borrow won't touch the input So, the input is now an (immutable ref) argument to all the methods that used to refer to `&self.input` And there were a lot... But now `Token` doesn't carry an owned `String` Also shrunk `Tokenizer` by doing all math in terms of byte offsets into its input (using existing `SourceCodePosition` fields) instead of storing a separate `Vec<char>` with char indices
  * Replaced `String` with `&'static str` in `ForeignFunction`
  * Removed unused `CommandParser::set_code_source_id`
  * Removed alias "ls" for "list" command
  * Replaced trailing space characters in two tests with `\x20` to prevent them from being removed when removing trailing whitespace on save
  * Changed `InvalidCommand` to take a `String` instead of `&'static str` Replaced `ensure_zero_args!` macro with function, now that this is possible (since we can use `format!` instead of `concat!)
  * Enum-ified command kind, making it strongly typed (no need for `unreachable!`) Made "list" report incorrect number of args before reporting invalid arg, in the event that both errors were present
  * Fixed bug where `resolver.add_code_source` was run twice per non-command input How: split `CommandParser` into a second struct, `SourcelessCommandParser`, that contains just the input, no `code_source_id` `SourcelessCommandParser` has a fallible initializer that only returns `Some(Self)` if the line is indeed a command (ie starts with a command word) Then we simply check if this initializer succeeded; if so then make a new `code_source_id` and construct the full `CommandParser`, then parse the command
  * Made struct `CommandParser` and reimplemented command parsing in terms of it (much cleaner)
  * Passed `code_source_id` to `parse_command` instead of a `Resolver` Note that there is a bug where non-command inputs run `add_course_source` twice, which leads to incorrect line numbers
  * Fixed clippy warnings
  * Fixed typo: TrivialResultion -> TrivialResolution
  * Added .DS_Store to gitignore
  * Add 3D printing example
  * Reduced some copy-pasted code
  * Continued REPL if `save dst` errored instead of just exiting
  * Tests for Command
  * Added Info command Added some helper functions for commands
  * Implemented commands like `list`, `help`, `save` (new) with more flexible parsing (eg tolerant of arbitrary whitespace) Commands report `ParseError`s if the syntax is invalid (eg too many or not enough args) This required making `Resolver::add_code_source` public and adding `Context::resolver_mut` to track source code positions of commands
