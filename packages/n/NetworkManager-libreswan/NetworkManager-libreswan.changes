- Update to version 1.2.12:
  + libnm-glib compatibility (NetworkManager < 1.0) is disabled by
    default. It can be enabled by passing --with-libnm-glib to
    configure script. Nobody should need it by now. Users that
    still use this are encourage to let us know before the
    libnm-glib support is removed for good.
  + Fixed the advanced dialog not working in Gnome.
  + Updated translations.
- Stop passing --without-libnm-glib to configure, no longer needed.
