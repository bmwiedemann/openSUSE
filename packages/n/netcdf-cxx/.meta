  <title>Old C++ library for the Unidata network Common Data Form</title>
  <description>NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and
machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing
of array-oriented scientific data.
This package provides the old C++ API. It's not recommended for new projects,
but it still works.
