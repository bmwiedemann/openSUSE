      automatically log you in.

The code now incorporates the contrast between the background color and the color generated by the user_name when picking colors.  It currently has two 'big' issues: 1. Colors are not cached.  I am planning on adding a QHash for this a little later.  This should improve performance by not calculating the color for the same users over and over and over again. 2. Theme changes do not trigger the colors to get refreshed. Currently, you will have to switch to a different room and back to get the colors to refresh.
  * Make the author text slightly large.
