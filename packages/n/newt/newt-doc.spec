%description
This package contains a tutorial about the Newt windowing toolkit.

Newt is a programming library for color text-mode, widget-based user
interfaces.  Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets,
check boxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars,
etc., to text mode user interfaces. Newt is based on the slang library.
