.SH NAME
nrpe \- Nagios Remote Plugin Executor - Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nagios-nrpe
\fI-c <config_file> <mode>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The purpose of this addon is to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on a
remote host in as transparent a manner as possible.
.PP
This program runs as a background process on the remote host and processes
command execution requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the Nagios host.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
<config_file> = Name of config file to use
.IP
<mode>        = One of the following two operating modes:
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
=    Run as a service under inetd or xinetd
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
=    Run as a standalone daemon
.PP
Notes:
This program is designed to process requests from the check_nrpe
plugin on the host(s) running Nagios.  It can run as a service
under inetd or xinetd (read the docs for info on this), or as a
standalone daemon. Once a request is received from an authorized
host, NRPE will execute the command/plugin (as defined in the
config file) and return the plugin output and return code to the
check_nrpe plugin.
