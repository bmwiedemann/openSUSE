Summary:        A library of common math and DSP functions optimized for ARM NEON

%description -n libNE10-%{sover}
Ne10 is a library of common functions that have been
optimised for ARM-based CPUs equipped with NEON SIMD capabilities.

The library provides some of the fastest implementations of key
operations available for the ARM v7-A and v8-A architectures,
particularly focusing on math, signal processing, image processing,
and physics functions.

This package contains the shared library.
