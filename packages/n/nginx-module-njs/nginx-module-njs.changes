- update to 0.8.1:
  * Implement a number of useful language facilities around shared
    dictionaries, add more global nginx properties, and
    configuration directives (js_periodic, js_shared_dict_zone)
  * Possibly incompatible change: native methods are provided with
    retval argument. This change breaks compatibility with C
    extension for njs requiring the modification of the code.
  * A number of non-compliant deprecated String methods were
    removed
