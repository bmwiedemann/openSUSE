  <title>NetworkManager dispatcher script for DNS bind configuration</title>
  <description>NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection
available at all times. The point of NetworkManager is to make
networking configuration and setup as painless and automatic as
possible. If using DHCP, NetworkManager is intended to replace
default routes, obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server, and change
name servers whenever it sees fit.

This package provides a NetworkManager dispatcher script for DNS
bind configuration.
