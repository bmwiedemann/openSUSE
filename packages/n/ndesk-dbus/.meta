  <title>Managed C# implementation of D-Bus</title>
  <description>This is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as
&quot;managed D-Bus&quot; to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap
libdbus).

It is a clean-room implementation based on the D-Bus Specification
Version 0.11 and study of the wire protocol of existing tools.</description>
