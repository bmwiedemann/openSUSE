statd: take user-id from /var/lib/nfs/sm

Having /var/lib/nfs writeable by statd is not ideal
as there are files in there that statd doesn't need
to access.
Aftger dropping privs, statd and sm-notify only need to
access files in the directories sm and sm.bak.
So take the uid for these deamons from 'sm'.
