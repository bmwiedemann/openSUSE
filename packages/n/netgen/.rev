    <comment>- Fix build on ARM and PPC, only include immintrin.h when SSE is available
- Correct License:, netgen has always been LGPL-2.1-only.
- Package License file.
- Remove boost BuildRequires:, it is not used at all.
- Guard Requires: occt-devel in devel package with bcond, so it
  does not get pulled in if netgen is built without OpenCascade.


- switch to gcc7
- Remove ldconfig calls since there are only dlopened plugins,
  no standard libraries.
- Wrap description.

- /usr/bin/netgen was a policy violation, -&gt; /usr/lib/netgen
