  <title>TCP/IP swiss army knife</title>
  <description>A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable
&quot;back-end&quot; tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other
programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network
debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
connection you would need and has several interesting built-in
capabilities.

This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat, including support
for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.</description>
