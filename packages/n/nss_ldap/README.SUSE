To use the nss_ldap module, you need to do the following:

Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf and add the ldap service, or copy
/usr/share/doc/packages/nss_ldap/nsswitch.ldap to /etc/nsswitch.config
and edit it.

If you don't have an /etc/ldap.conf file from another packages, copy
/usr/doc/packages/nss_ldap/ldap.conf into the /etc/ directory and edit this
configuration file.

You can also use the YaST2 ldap module to configure a LDAP client.
