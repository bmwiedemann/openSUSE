%description
Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, in a similar vein to Escape Velocity.

Naev is played from a top-down perspective, featuring fast-paced combat, many ships,
a large variety of equipment and a large galaxy to explore. The game is
open-ended, letting you proceed at your own pace.
