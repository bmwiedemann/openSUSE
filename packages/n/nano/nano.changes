    handle choosing to not open a file when locked instead of in
    open_file().
  * src/winio.c (do_credits): Add a general entry for all translators.
  * src/files.c (write_lockfile): Avoid writing uninitialized bytes
    to the lock file -- a simple null_at() would not initialize the
    buffer.
  * src/files.c (do_lockfile): Make sure that 'lockprog' and
    'lockuser' are terminated -- strncpy() does not guarantee that
    on its own.
  * src/files.c (do_lockfile): Avoid printing a wrong PID on the
    status bar due to treating serialized PID bytes as signed
    integers.
  * src/files.c (write_lockfile): Do not trim the nano version
    number -- snprintf() counts the trailing zero into the size limit.
  * src/cut.c (do_cut_text): Make sure to set modified even when
    using --enable-tiny.
  * src/file.c (do_lockfile): Also show the name of the affected file
    when finding a lock file, for when many files are opened at once.
  * src/file.c (do_lockfile): The user does the editing, not the editor.
  * doc/syntax/sh.nanorc: Recognize also dash, openrc and runscript.
  * README: Fix the explanation of how to subscribe to a mailing list.
  * doc/syntax/{java,lua,python,ruby}.nanorc: Wrap some overlong lines.
  * src/rcfile.c (parse_binding): Add an exception for do_toggle() as
    rebinding toggles broke with r5022. (Fixed in r5134.)
  * doc/man/nanorc.5, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Add a note about the
    inherent imperfection of using regular expressions for syntax
    highlighting.
  * doc/man/nanorc.5: Improve the indentation of some lists.
  * doc/man/nanorc.5, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Remove the mistaken
    square brackets around the arguments of "header" and "magic" --
    those arguments are not optional. Also add "formatter" to the
    texinfo document, and slightly improve its punctuation.
  * src/proto.h, src/nano.c: Fix compilation with --enable-tiny plus
    --enable-nanorc.
  * src/rcfile.c (parse_binding): Fix the rebinding of toggles.
  * doc/man/{nano.1,rnano.1,nanorc.5}, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Update
    years and version numbers in the docs in anticipation of a release.
  * src/nano.c (version): Drop compile time from version information
    to enable a reproducible build.
  * src/nano.c (renumber): Get out if there is nothing to renumber,
    to prevent do_undo() from falling over trying to renumber emptiness.
  * src/text.c (do_formatter): Fix a message plus a few comments.
  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Do not set the modified flag when
    an external spell checker didn't make any changes.
  * src/nano.c (finish_stdin_pager, cancel_stdin_pager, stdin_pager):
    Normalize the whitespace, remove an old comment, and place another
    one better.
  * src/text.c (do_undo): Make a message equal to another one. It
    was mistakenly changed in r4950. (This is translation-neutral.)
  * src/global.c (shortcut_init): Keep related items together in the
    ^G help screen.
  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Restore the positions of the mark
    and the cursor in a better way: to the columns where they were.
  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Remove some leftovers.
  * src/search.c: Place some comments better and unwrap some lines.
  * src/chars.c (move_mbleft): Start looking for a multibyte char
    not at the start of the string, but only as far back as such a
    char can possibly be. Change suggested by Mark Majeres.
  *  src/search.c (findnextstr): Step backward or forward not simply
    one byte but one character (possibly multibyte).
  * src/winio.c (edit_redraw): Do not center the current line when
    smooth scrolling is used.
- Do less manually in spec.

    nano to have undo/redo support as it now defaults to being enabled.
  * Better handling of --tempfile mode.
  * Better handling of command line arguments when also attempting to specify
    +<line number>.

  * Ability to read named pipes (--noread), as well as linter support (see the
    nanorc man page for details).
  * Much improved syntax highlighting code, and configurations for JSON,
    texinfo, Go, and a default syntax for catch all highlighting.
  * Ability to set the color of the title bar, status bar, and shortcut keys
    (e.g. "^X") and their descriptions (see the nanorc man page for details).
  * Lots of other fixes.

    existing file extension and header support already available.
  * Cursor position can be saved between editing sessions with the -P or
    --poslog command line flags, or via "set poslog" in your .nanorc.
  * Also included are some fixes for compilation with g++, and better handling
    of issues writing the backup file, which should reduce the need for the
   'set allow_insecure_backup" nanorc option.
- Spec file updates:
  * More changes based on rpmdevtools templates and spec-cleaner run.

Tue Aug 26 22:23:00 CEST 2008 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.8
  * GNU nano 2.0.8 is what she said.  This release contains fixes for
    several long standing issues, including: crashing when starting with too
    small a window size, compilation fixes for AIX curses, crashes in the
    help menu using some locales, and a fun issue where nano mistalenly
    reports a successful file write on filesystems which are almost
    completely full.  Have at it.

Fri Dec 21 12:02:41 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

* update to version 2.0.7
  * nano 2.0.7 keeps its balance.  This release fixes several bugs, among
    others: a segfault and several cursor positioning problems when
    uncutting text or inserting files into the current buffer; a problem
    where the total number of characters would be miscalculated when
    replacing single-byte characters with multibyte ones; several minor
    issues with the statusbar prompt involving text display and mouse
    support; and several oddities when tab-completing in the middle of a
    line.  It also improves autodetection of DOS and Mac format files,
    properly supports the mouse wheel when using a version of ncurses built
    with the --enable-ext-mouse option, fixes some problems under NetBSD
    curses, adds a lot of translation updates, and adds more minor
    documentation updates.  Slang curses emulation support has also been
    changed to turn off all the options that --enable-tiny does, as it's
    hopelessly broken otherwise.  Finally, nano is now licensed under the
    GNU GPL version 3 or later, and its documentation is now dual-licensed
    under the GNU GPL version 3 or later and the GNU FDL version 1.2 or
    later.  Have fun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec  6 16:47:35 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- added nano-2.0.6.patch to fix error: call to '__open_missing_mode'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 13:30:59 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.6
  * GNU nano 2.0.6 "that was quick" is released.  This release fixes a
    potential segfault after justifying text marked from the bottom up.  It
    also adds one more minor documentation update.  Enjoy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 23 00:52:22 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.5
  * GNU nano 2.0.5 braces for impact.  Among other things, this release
    fixes various problems (including a segfault) when trying to open or
    save a file in a directory beginning with "~" that isn't a home
    directory; fixes a problem where a file with no name could be saved over
    an existing filename with no warning about overwriting it; properly
    disallows opening directories or device files from "include" commands in
    nanorc files; no longer displays a misleading prompt when trying to save
    in restricted mode with the mark on; and properly supports the Cancel
    and Shift-Cancel keys.  It also improves several color syntaxes to
    highlight trailing whitespace, just as the Java syntax does, and adds
    yet more minor documentation updates.  Have fun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  7 13:40:56 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.4
  * GNU nano 2.0.4 heralds the dawn.  This release contains proper support
    for the Ctrl-[arrow key], Shift-[arrow key], and F13-F16 keys under
    Xfce's Terminal.  It also adds still more minor documentation updates. 
    Enjoy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 29 14:22:15 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- fixed build by adding BuildRequires: ncurses-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 29 15:46:28 CET 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.3
  * GNU nano 2.0.3 flows toward its ending.  This release contains several
    minor optimizations to make the executable a little smaller under some
    circumstances, some translation updates, improvements to the color
    syntax for Python, and still more minor documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 12:27:20 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.2
  * GNU nano 2.0.2 forges ahead.  This release fixes a segfault when trying
    to save in a nonexistent directory; fixes handling of strings containing
    nulls at the "Write File", "Insert File", "Execute Command", and "Go to
    Directory" prompts; fixes several minor memory leaks; fixes two more
    potential compilation warnings; adds a few translation updates; and adds
    a few more minor documentation updates.  Enjoy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 20 17:06:11 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.1
  * GNU nano 2.0.1 emerges from its cocoon.  This release contains several
    bugfixes: saving one file over another will now always warn about
    overwriting it, overwriting a file is no longer possible when saving a
    new file in restricted mode, and zero-length Unicode characters are now
    highlighted properly when nano is built without regular expression
    support.  It also adds several minor documentation updates.  Have fun
    with it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 12 15:30:30 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.0
  * GNU nano 2.0.0 does its little dance.  This release adds documentation
    updates and a few cosmetic tweaks.  For those who haven't been following
    nano 1.3 development, there are a ton of new features, including support
    for UTF-8, moving to a specified line and column instead of just a line,
    improved color syntax highlighting, inserting previously untypeable
    characters using "Verbatim Input" mode, and copying text into the
    cutbuffer without cutting it.  There are also fixes for some
    long-standing bugs, such as the "NumLock glitch" from nano 1.2.x, and
    the inability to unjustify text after resizing.  Finally, there are also
    a ton of translation updates and new translations, as well as new color
    syntaxes.  See the UPGRADE file for more information, and enjoy the new
    stable release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 26 07:46:17 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 1.3.12 
  * This release contains the last new features that nano will have before
    2.0: copying text into the cutbuffer without cutting it, indenting lines
    of marked text with a single keystroke, reworked help text that should
    be easier for new users, searching for filenames in the file browser,
    the ability to include color regexes in files separate from nanorc
    files, etc.  It also contains many bugfixes.  Text can now be
    unjustified after justifying it and resizing the window; the screen is
    now cleared when suspending; the "default" color syntax is now handled
    properly at all times; lines of text containing tabs are now wrapped at
    the right place; double-column characters are now properly displayed
    when past the right edge of the screen; invalid multi-line color regexes
    are now ignored; and so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 14:07:25 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 1.3.11
  * This release focuses mostly on bugfixes, which include better handling
    of the cursor at the statusbar prompt, support for certain combinations
    of Shift and keyboard keys in both normal and
    --rebind-keypad mode, a fix for a minor display problem after some
    searches, a real fix for a long-standing segfault when displaying overly
    long lines, and a real fix for nano's not hanging up properly in xterm
    under certain circumstances.  There are also several new features, such
    as the ability to set the characters used as brackets when searching for
    matching brackets, and tab completion of directories at the "Go To
    Directory" prompt.
