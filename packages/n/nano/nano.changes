  highlighting for _channel and _patchinfo files used by OBS
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 29 07:09:44 UTC 2022 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 6.3:
  * For multiline regexes, text is now colored as soon a start
    match is found, also when there is no end match at all.
  * The colorizing of any line is stopped after two thousand bytes
    to avoid frustrating delays.
  * When environment variable NO_COLOR is set, the two default
    colors (yellow for the spotlight, red for error messages) are
    suppressed when no interface colors are specified in a nanorc
    file.
  * Full justification and piping the whole buffer through a
    command now keep the cursor at the same line number.
  * Utility 'xsel' can be used to copy a marked region to the

  * Option --zero hides the interface and uses the whole terminal
    for editing
  * Colors can be given also in #rgb hexadecimal, to select the
    nearest color from the 6x6x6 color-cube palette available on
    256-color terminals
  * Fourteen new color names are available, from rosy to crimson

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  9 09:52:36 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU nano 5.9:
  * The extension of a filename is added to the name of a
    corresponding temporary file, so that spell checking a C file,
    for example, will check only the comments and strings
    (when using 'aspell').
  * The process number is added to the name of an emergency save
    file, so that when multiple nanos die they will not fight over
    a filename.
  * Undoing a cutting operation will restore an anchor that was
    located in the cut area to its original line.
  * When using --locking, saving a new buffer will create a lock
    file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 17 05:52:33 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU nano 5.8:
  * After a search, the spotlighting is dropped after 1.5 seconds
    (0.8 seconds with --quick) to avoid the idea that the text is
    selected.
  * A + and a space before a filename on the command line will put
    the cursor at the end of the corresponding buffer.
  * Linter messages no longer include filename and line/column
    numbers.
  * Color name "grey" or "gray" can be used instead of "lightblack"
  * The color of the minibar can be chosen with 'set minicolor'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 29 16:54:19 UTC 2021 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- GNU nano 5.7:

  * When opening multiple buffers and there is an error message,
    this message is shown again upon first switch to the relevant
    buffer
  * The position and size of the indicator now follow actual
    lines, instead of visual lines when in softwrap mode, meaning
    that the size of the indicator can change when scrolling in
    softwrap mode

  * A search match gets highlighted (in black on yellow by
    default), in addition to placing the cursor at the start of
    the matchA. The color combination can be changed with 
    'set highlightcolor'. By default the cursor is hidden until the
    next keystroke, but it can be forced on with --showcursor / 
    'set showcursor'.
  * Option --markmatch / 'set markmatch' has been removed
  * Cursor position and character code are displayed in the
    minibar only when option --constantshow / 'set constantshow'
    is used, and their display can be toggled with M-C
  * The state flags are displayed in the minibar only when option
    --stateflags / 'set stateflags' is used

- GNU nano 5.4:
  * Moving the cursor now skips over combining characters (an
    other zero-width characters)
  * Deleting a character deletes also any succeeding zero-width
    characters but backspacing deletes just one character at a time

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  7 19:46:46 UTC 2020 - Aaron Stern <ukbeast89@protonmail.com>

- GNU nano 5.3:
  * Option 'set stateflags' makes nano show the state of auto-indenting,
    the mark, hard-wrapping, macro recording, and soft-wrapping in the
    title bar. The flags take the place of "Modified", and a modified
    buffer is instead indicated by an asterisk (*) after its name.
  * Nano no longer by default tries using libmagic to determine the type
    of a file (when neither filename nor first line gave a clue), because
    in most cases it is a waste of time. It requires using the option
    --magic or -! or 'set magic' to make nano try libmagic.
  * The color of the indicator can be changed with 'set scrollercolor'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 12:51:44 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 29 11:45:53 UTC 2020 - Paolo Stivanin <info@paolostivanin.com>

- GNU nano 5.0:
  * With --indicator (or -q or 'set indicator') nano will show a kind
    of scrollbar on the righthand side of the screen to indicate where
    in the buffer the viewport is located and how much it covers.
  * With <Alt+Insert> any line can be "tagged" with an anchor, and
    <Alt+PageUp> and <Alt+PageDown> will jump to the nearest anchor.
    When using line numbers, an anchor is shown as "+" in the margin.
  * The Execute Command prompt is now directly accessible from the
    main menu (with ^T, replacing the Spell Checker). The Linter,
    Formatter, Spell Checker, Full Justification, Suspension, and
    Cut-Till-End functions are available in this menu too.
  * On terminals that support at least 256 colors, nine new color
    names are available: pink, purple, mauve, lagoon, mint, lime,
    peach, orange, and latte. These do not have lighter versions.
  * For the color names red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta,
    white, and black, the prefix 'light' gives a brighter color.
    Prefix 'bright' is deprecated, as it means both bold AND light.
  * All color names can be preceded with "bold," and/or "italic,"
    (in that order) to get a bold and/or italic typeface.
  * With --bookstyle (or -O or 'set bookstyle') nano considers any
    line that begins with whitespace as the start of a paragraph.
  * Refreshing the screen with ^L now works in every menu.
  * In the main menu, ^L also centers the line with the cursor.
  * Toggling the help lines with M-X now works in all menus except
    in the help viewer and the linter.
  * At a filename prompt, the first <Tab> lists the possibilities,
    and these are listed near the bottom instead of near the top.
  * Bindable function 'curpos' has been renamed to 'location'.
  * Long option --tempfile has been renamed to --saveonexit.
  * Short option -S is now a synonym of --softwrap.
  * The New Buffer toggle (M-F) has become non-persistent. Options
    --multibuffer and 'set multibuffer' still make it default to on.
  * Backup files will retain their group ownership (when possible).
  * Data is synced to disk before "... lines written" is shown.
  * The raw escape sequences for F13 to F16 are no longer recognized.
  * Distro-specific syntaxes, and syntaxes of less common languages,
    have been moved down to subdirectory syntax/extra/. The affected
    distros and others may wish to move wanted syntaxes one level up.
    Syntaxes for Markdown, Haskell, and Ada were added.

    down but will be indicated on the status bar with trailing dots

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    addition ability from this builder function of the shortcut list.
  * src/global.c (strtokeytype): Move this to a better place.
  * src/global.c (first_sc_for): Move this too to a better place.
  * src/prompt.c (do_yesno_prompt): Use the new and more direct
    func_from_key() wrapper instead of get_shortcut().
  * src/text.c (do_linter): Likewise.
  * src/files.c (do_insertfile, do_writeout): Likewise.
  * src/files.c (do_insertfile): Adjust some indentation.
  * src/prompt.c (do_statusbar_input), src/browser.c (do_browser):
    Reorder a few things, and adjust some whitespace.
  * doc/man/nano.1, doc/man/rnano.1: Separate short and long option
    by a comma instead of putting the long one between parentheses.
    And showing the required quotes around the argument of -Q.
  * doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Standardize the formatting of command-line
    options -- each one separately. Also add some more markup.
  * doc/man/nano.1, doc/man/rnano.1: Tweak the formatting a bit so
    that po4a will create a nicer POT file.
  * doc/man/nanorc.5: Improve some of the wordings and formatting.

    'Bad regex, empty (sub)expression' error on some systems.
  * doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Improve some wordings and formatting.
  * src/text.c (do_justify): Replace the old get_shortcut() wrapper
    with the new func_from_key().

    lines of the form "#!/usr/bin/env thing" besides "#!/bin/thing".
  * doc/syntax/spec.nanorc: Colorize %pretrans and %posttrans fully.
  * src/files.c (do_lockfile): Gettextize the "File being edited"
    prompt, and improve its wording.
  * src/winio.c (do_credits): Remove the names of past translators
    from the Easter-egg scroll.
  * THANKS: Add a missing historical translator name.
  * src/winio.c (do_credits): Add Mark to the scroll, for all his
    undo work, colouring nano's interface, and other patches.
  * New formatter code to support syntaxes like
    go which have tools to automatically lint and reformat the text
    for you (gofmt), which is lovely. rcfile option formatter,
    function text.c:do_formatter() and some other calls.
  * src/files.c (open_buffer): Check here for locking and properly
    handle choosing to not open a file when locked instead of in
    open_file().
  * src/winio.c (do_credits): Add a general entry for all translators.
  * src/files.c (write_lockfile): Avoid writing uninitialized bytes
    to the lock file -- a simple null_at() would not initialize the
    buffer.
  * src/files.c (do_lockfile): Make sure that 'lockprog' and
    'lockuser' are terminated -- strncpy() does not guarantee that
    on its own.
  * src/files.c (do_lockfile): Avoid printing a wrong PID on the
    status bar due to treating serialized PID bytes as signed
    integers.
  * src/files.c (write_lockfile): Do not trim the nano version
    number -- snprintf() counts the trailing zero into the size limit.
  * src/cut.c (do_cut_text): Make sure to set modified even when
    using --enable-tiny.
  * src/file.c (do_lockfile): Also show the name of the affected file

    rebinding toggles broke with r5022. (Fixed in r5134.)
  * doc/man/nanorc.5, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Add a note about the
    inherent imperfection of using regular expressions for syntax
    highlighting.
  * doc/man/nanorc.5: Improve the indentation of some lists.
  * doc/man/nanorc.5, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Remove the mistaken
    square brackets around the arguments of "header" and "magic" --
    those arguments are not optional. Also add "formatter" to the
    texinfo document, and slightly improve its punctuation.
  * src/proto.h, src/nano.c: Fix compilation with --enable-tiny plus
    --enable-nanorc.
  * src/rcfile.c (parse_binding): Fix the rebinding of toggles.
  * doc/man/{nano.1,rnano.1,nanorc.5}, doc/texinfo/nano.texi: Update
    years and version numbers in the docs in anticipation of a release.
  * src/nano.c (version): Drop compile time from version information
    to enable a reproducible build.

    to prevent do_undo() from falling over trying to renumber emptiness.

  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Do not set the modified flag when
    an external spell checker didn't make any changes.
  * src/nano.c (finish_stdin_pager, cancel_stdin_pager, stdin_pager):
    Normalize the whitespace, remove an old comment, and place another
    one better.
  * src/text.c (do_undo): Make a message equal to another one. It
    was mistakenly changed in r4950. (This is translation-neutral.)
  * src/global.c (shortcut_init): Keep related items together in the
    ^G help screen.
  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Restore the positions of the mark
    and the cursor in a better way: to the columns where they were.
  * src/text.c (do_alt_speller): Remove some leftovers.
  * src/search.c: Place some comments better and unwrap some lines.
  * src/chars.c (move_mbleft): Start looking for a multibyte char
    not at the start of the string, but only as far back as such a
    char can possibly be. Change suggested by Mark Majeres.
  *  src/search.c (findnextstr): Step backward or forward not simply
    one byte but one character (possibly multibyte).
  * src/winio.c (edit_redraw): Do not center the current line when
    smooth scrolling is used.

* update to version 2.0.7
  * nano 2.0.7 keeps its balance.  This release fixes several bugs, among
    others: a segfault and several cursor positioning problems when
    uncutting text or inserting files into the current buffer; a problem
    where the total number of characters would be miscalculated when
    replacing single-byte characters with multibyte ones; several minor
    issues with the statusbar prompt involving text display and mouse
    support; and several oddities when tab-completing in the middle of a
    line.  It also improves autodetection of DOS and Mac format files,
    properly supports the mouse wheel when using a version of ncurses built
    with the --enable-ext-mouse option, fixes some problems under NetBSD
    curses, adds a lot of translation updates, and adds more minor
    documentation updates.  Slang curses emulation support has also been
    changed to turn off all the options that --enable-tiny does, as it's
    hopelessly broken otherwise.  Finally, nano is now licensed under the
    GNU GPL version 3 or later, and its documentation is now dual-licensed
    under the GNU GPL version 3 or later and the GNU FDL version 1.2 or
    later.  Have fun.

Thu May  3 13:30:59 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.6
  * GNU nano 2.0.6 "that was quick" is released.  This release fixes a
    potential segfault after justifying text marked from the bottom up.  It
    also adds one more minor documentation update.  Enjoy.

Mon Apr 23 00:52:22 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.5
  * GNU nano 2.0.5 braces for impact.  Among other things, this release
    fixes various problems (including a segfault) when trying to open or
    save a file in a directory beginning with "~" that isn't a home
    directory; fixes a problem where a file with no name could be saved over
    an existing filename with no warning about overwriting it; properly
    disallows opening directories or device files from "include" commands in
    nanorc files; no longer displays a misleading prompt when trying to save
    in restricted mode with the mark on; and properly supports the Cancel
    and Shift-Cancel keys.  It also improves several color syntaxes to
    highlight trailing whitespace, just as the Java syntax does, and adds
    yet more minor documentation updates.  Have fun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr  7 13:40:56 CEST 2007 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.4
  * GNU nano 2.0.4 heralds the dawn.  This release contains proper support
    for the Ctrl-[arrow key], Shift-[arrow key], and F13-F16 keys under
    Xfce's Terminal.  It also adds still more minor documentation updates. 
    Enjoy.

- update to version 2.0.3
  * GNU nano 2.0.3 flows toward its ending.  This release contains several
    minor optimizations to make the executable a little smaller under some
    circumstances, some translation updates, improvements to the color
    syntax for Python, and still more minor documentation updates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 21 12:27:20 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.2
  * GNU nano 2.0.2 forges ahead.  This release fixes a segfault when trying
    to save in a nonexistent directory; fixes handling of strings containing
    nulls at the "Write File", "Insert File", "Execute Command", and "Go to
    Directory" prompts; fixes several minor memory leaks; fixes two more
    potential compilation warnings; adds a few translation updates; and adds
    a few more minor documentation updates.  Enjoy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 20 17:06:11 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.1
  * GNU nano 2.0.1 emerges from its cocoon.  This release contains several
    bugfixes: saving one file over another will now always warn about
    overwriting it, overwriting a file is no longer possible when saving a
    new file in restricted mode, and zero-length Unicode characters are now
    highlighted properly when nano is built without regular expression
    support.  It also adds several minor documentation updates.  Have fun
    with it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 12 15:30:30 CET 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 2.0.0
  * GNU nano 2.0.0 does its little dance.  This release adds documentation
    updates and a few cosmetic tweaks.  For those who haven't been following
    nano 1.3 development, there are a ton of new features, including support
    for UTF-8, moving to a specified line and column instead of just a line,
    improved color syntax highlighting, inserting previously untypeable
    characters using "Verbatim Input" mode, and copying text into the
    cutbuffer without cutting it.  There are also fixes for some
    long-standing bugs, such as the "NumLock glitch" from nano 1.2.x, and
    the inability to unjustify text after resizing.  Finally, there are also
    a ton of translation updates and new translations, as well as new color
    syntaxes.  See the UPGRADE file for more information, and enjoy the new
    stable release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 26 07:46:17 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 1.3.12 
  * This release contains the last new features that nano will have before
    2.0: copying text into the cutbuffer without cutting it, indenting lines
    of marked text with a single keystroke, reworked help text that should
    be easier for new users, searching for filenames in the file browser,
    the ability to include color regexes in files separate from nanorc
    files, etc.  It also contains many bugfixes.  Text can now be
    unjustified after justifying it and resizing the window; the screen is
    now cleared when suspending; the "default" color syntax is now handled
    properly at all times; lines of text containing tabs are now wrapped at
    the right place; double-column characters are now properly displayed
    when past the right edge of the screen; invalid multi-line color regexes
    are now ignored; and so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 25 14:07:25 CEST 2006 - cthiel@suse.de

- update to version 1.3.11
  * This release focuses mostly on bugfixes, which include better handling
    of the cursor at the statusbar prompt, support for certain combinations
    of Shift and keyboard keys in both normal and
    --rebind-keypad mode, a fix for a minor display problem after some
    searches, a real fix for a long-standing segfault when displaying overly
    long lines, and a real fix for nano's not hanging up properly in xterm
    under certain circumstances.  There are also several new features, such
    as the ability to set the characters used as brackets when searching for
    matching brackets, and tab completion of directories at the "Go To
    Directory" prompt.
