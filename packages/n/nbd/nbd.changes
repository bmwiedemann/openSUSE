  (bsc#1063135)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  7 13:21:03 UTC 2017 - olaf@aepfle.de

- Add nbd-client.service which will provide a nbd@.service to
  allow other units to require a nbd@nbd0.service if /etc/nbdtab
  is configured accordingly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun  8 12:07:49 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.16.1:
  * Only change is a minor bugfix from 3.16, so that
    --enable-syslog is unbroken.
- Changes for version 3.16.0:
  * Implement the NBD_OPT_GO and NBD_OPT_INFO negotiation options
    in both the client and the server, and use them in preference
    over NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME (but fall back to the latter in case
    the serverdoesn't support NBD_OPT_GO).
  * Make sure we still run the postrun command, even if the
    connection was  closed improperly.
  * Add a new "waitfile" parameter.
  * Make sure that nbd compiles on non-Linux platforms again, in
    the face of all variants of the GnuTLS options.
  * Various fixes for issues found by Coverity

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 24 12:16:55 UTC 2017 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to version 3.15.2:
  * Fix the copyonwrite situation with multiple threads. This has
    been broken since nbd 3.12, where multiple outstanding writes
    could corrupt the copyonwrite diff file.
  * Build system improvements so that things work again if
    nbd-client isn't buildable while GnuTLS is enabled
  * Documentation updates
  * Fixes to the GnuTLS usage, and the ability to configure the
    priority string for that library
- Changes for version 3.15.1:
  * minor but crucial fix in the handling of the WRITE_ZEROES
    command, which would otherwise not work in cooperation with
    TLS.
- Changes for version 3.15.0:
  * Implement NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES, for efficiently writing large
    numbers of zeroes (server side implementation only)
  * (optional) support for NBD_OPT_STARTTLS, using GnuTLS.
  * Support for multiplexing commands over multiple connections,
    for improving performance (requires Linux 4.10 or above).
  * Support for using splice(), also for improving performance
  * Protocol errors during negotiation now are accompanied by a 
    human-readable error string.
  * Fix the handling of maxconnections, so that it is not a global
    setting (over all exports) but rather a per-export setting.
  * Fix handling of unknown options sent to the server. Previously
    we would desync from the protocol, causing another error and a
    disconnect.
  * Produce a log message when the address family of the client
    socket does not match the expected address family in the
    authfile handling. A proper fix would convert IPv4 sockets to
    v6-mapped v4 sockets, but that's much more complicated.
  * and various other minor fixes too small to mention here; see
    the changelog
- Changes for version 3.14.0:
  * Major review of doc/proto.md, with many clarifications.
  * Some bug fixes for nbd-server that were discovered during the
    extensive updates to proto.md
  * Some fixes for non-Linux platforms,
  * Some minor incremental improvements to the new nbdtab
    functionality,
  * Fix the way we tell the kernel about really small exports,
  * Removal of references to the no longer supported oldstyle from
    all documentation
  * Minor updates, clarifications, and syntax fixes for man pages
    and other documentation
  * Addition of a systemd unit file for nbd-client. This requires a
    kernel which issues change events upon disconnect
    (commit 37091fdd83), and a udev which correctly sets
    SYSTEMD_READY
- Drop init.nbd-server and support for non systemd distributions
- Drop patches:
  * nbd-2.9.25-close.diff (upstreamed)
  * nbd-2.9.25-doxyfile.diff (no longer needed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 23 16:59:39 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 3.13
  * This is mainly a bugfix release, containing fixes found in 
    3.12.1 by compiling on different architectures, submitting the 
    build to Coverity Scan, and some analysis of intermittent 
    failures that found a race condition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  1 17:01:47 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com
- Update to version 3.12.1
  * ensures the source to the "nbdtab" man page is correctly shipped 
    with the rest of the source.
- Changes from version 3.12
  * inetd mode should work again, now using the default export name
    in the newstyle protocol 
  * when specifying an export on the server command line or not specifying
    a name on a client command line, the newstyle protocol is used with 
    the default export name (but a warning will be produced stating 
    that oldstyle is no longer supported) 
  * All traces of oldstyle (except a few error messages) have been 
    removed 
  * We now listen on IPv4 and IPv6 by default, regardless of what 
    the system's configuration is like, by explicitly listening both 
    on 0.0.0.0 and ::. 
  * Some bugs in the handling of the TRIM command have been removed 
  * nbd  *client now uses readit() in the negotiation, rather than 
    plain non  *retrying read(). 
  * It is now possible to listen on multiple addresses; the 
    "listenaddr" parameter has been changed into a comma  *separated 
    list of addresses to listen on 
  * nbd  *client now supports an nbdtab file, which allows connecting
    a device by just using the device name 
  * nbd  *server now uses a GThreadPool to implement asynchronous handling 
    of requests   
  * Punching holes on files is now supported on cygwin, too.
- Remove no-return-nonvoid.patch; fixed on upstream release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 28 11:32:18 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

  * nbd_signaling_CVE-2015-0847.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 17 13:27:19 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 3.10
  * There really is only one change since 3.9: drop of the 
    "oldstyle" support from nbd-server and nbd-client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar  5 12:28:06 UTC 2015 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Cleanup spec-file with spec-cleaner
- Do not generate config.example from README
  * add config.example as source
- Add unit file (nbd-server.service)
- Add sysconfig template (nbd-server.sysconfig)
- Add no-return-nonvoid.patch
- Update requirements
- Update to 3.9
  * AF_UNIX support
  * Fixed test suite on non-GNU getopt() implementations
  * New "treefiles" mode, which exports a gazillion of page-sized 
    files; useful for exporting things which are stored on an 
    SSHFS or amazon AWS (trough FUSE) or similar, where every 
    write causes an upload to the backend storage
  * New "cowdir" option, allowing to specify where copy-on-write 
    files are written.
  * Minor changes so that nbd-client can now also be compiled for 
    the Android platform. This required removal of the -swap 
    command line option, which requires the mlockall() system 
    call, unavailable on Android.
  * Protocol update: a reserved bit is used to avoid sending 
    the 124 bytes of useless data at the beginning of the 
    negotiation. The change is implemented so that things will 
    still work with clients not supporting this option, however.
  * gznbd is now built by the same build system, rather than 
    a separate one. Note however that gznbd is still 
    unmaintained; it should be considered a "contrib" feature.
  * "nbd-server -V" will now output the nbd-server version number.
  * Various fixes found through Coverity and the clang static 
    analyzer, and lots of other minor things too small to 
    mention here.

- socklen_t is always 32bit, size_t is 64bit. so a classical
  big endian 64bit error (bnc #674281)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 25 12:40:16 CET 2011 - ms@suse.de

- Update to nbd-2.9.20:
  * Documentation update
  * Fix buffer size checking (bnc #674281)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  5 11:58:52 CEST 2009 - ms@suse.de

- fixed missing close to open (bnc #528272)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  9 11:41:55 CEST 2009 - ms@suse.de

- Update to nbd-2.9.13:
  * Documentation update
  * Don't try working on partitions
    When a partition is given to the -d or -c command line options, reduce
    it to the master device instead. This assumes udev-style naming
    of device entries, though.
  * Fix autodetection
    Everything else in nbd-server was already 64bit-clean, but this part,
    where the size of a block device is autodected, wasn't.
    Replace the ioctl() to BLKGETSIZE with its 64bit version, so that trying
    to detect the size of a multi-terabyte block device does not fail.
  * Avoid unaligned access
  * Actually go daemon
    just doing chdir("/") leave file descriptors open, which is not ideal.
    Doing it this way closes everything, including any system-specific
    things we're not aware of.
  * Remove support for timeout option

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May  4 10:40:15 CEST 2009 - ms@suse.de

- Update to nbd-2.9.12:
  * use atoll instead of atol ... so that multi-terabyte exports work, too
  * Change meaning of -swap option: rather than trying to use a kernel patch
    which has been effectively dead since sometime around 2.1.something, do an
    mlockall() so that the kernel won't throw us out. The MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE
    bit might prove to be problematic, but if so, we'll deal with it when
    we get there
  * Use right printf() format string

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 20 08:13:31 CEST 2008 - garloff@suse.de

- Update to nbd-2.9.11:
  * nbd-client: new option -c to check for connection, -d to
    drop connection, -persist to infinitely retry connections
    dropped by server. timeout= setting 
  * nbd-server: drop autoreadonly option 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * * Configuration file support
  * The ability to server multiple nbd-server exports from one server
  * Better multiple-file support (files can now be of any random size)
  * Better support for virtualizing servers (in addition to replacing
    %s with the client's IP address, it is now also possible to use 
    other options which allow for hashed directories)
  * Support for changing uid and gid after startup
  * The ability to do the copy-on-write stuff with a sparse file rather
    than a mapped file (specified by a config file option), which may be
    slightly faster.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add export verification.
  * Make sure queue is empty for write requests to read-only export.
- Update to nbd-2.8.4:

Mon Mar  6 14:14:26 CET 2006 - garloff@suse.de

- Make sure children quit when they finish serving, rather than
