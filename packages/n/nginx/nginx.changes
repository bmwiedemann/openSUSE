    the same as 1.9.x.
  - bugfix: fixed a typo in an error message.
  - bugfix: when the nginx core does not properly initialize
    r->headers_in.headers (due to 400 bad requests and etc),

- Fix the logrotate script: we had a hardcoded postrotate action
  pointing to /etc/init.d/nginx. This does not exist anymore on
  systemd hosts. Replace it with /usr/sbin/nginx -s reopen,  which
  will use the pid file passed in the config file or the compiled
  in default path.

  # For 64bit machines:
  load_module lib64/nginx/modules/ngx_http_geoip_module.so;

  # For 32bit machines:
  load_module lib/nginx/modules/ngx_http_geoip_module.so;

- update to version 1.10.0 stable
  * Bugfix: "recv() failed" errors might occur when using HHVM as a
       FastCGI server.
  * Bugfix: when using HTTP/2 and the "limit_req" or "auth_request"
       directives a timeout or a "client violated flow control" error might
       occur while reading client request body; the bug had appeared in
       1.9.14.
  * Workaround: a response might not be shown by some browsers if HTTP/2
       was used and client request body was not fully read; the bug had
       appeared in 1.9.14.

       directive.
       Thanks to Mindaugas Rasiukevicius.

  * Bugfix: the "client_max_body_size" directive might work incorrectly
       when using HTTP/2.
  * Bugfix: of minor bugs in logging.
  * Change: non-idempotent requests (POST, LOCK, PATCH) are no longer
       passed to the next server by default if a request has been sent to a
       backend; the "non_idempotent" parameter of the "proxy_next_upstream"
       directive explicitly allows retrying such requests.
  * Feature: the ngx_http_perl_module can be built dynamically.
  * Feature: UDP support in the stream module.
  * Feature: the "aio_write" directive.
  * Feature: now cache manager monitors number of elements in caches and
       tries to avoid cache keys zone overflows.
  * Bugfix: "task already active" and "second aio post" alerts might
       appear in logs when using the "sendfile" and "aio" directives with
       subrequests.
  * Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs if
       caching was used and a client closed a connection prematurely.
  * Bugfix: connections with clients might be closed needlessly if
       caching was used.
       Thanks to Justin Li.
  * Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU if the "sendfile" directive was used on

  * Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "sendfile" and "aio
       threads" directives.
  * Bugfix: in the "proxy_pass", "fastcgi_pass", "scgi_pass", and
       "uwsgi_pass" directives when using variables.
       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
  * Bugfix: in the ngx_http_sub_filter_module.
  * Bugfix: if an error occurred in a cached backend connection, the
       request was passed to the next server regardless of the
       proxy_next_upstream directive.

       Windows.

       appeared in 1.9.11.
       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
  * Bugfix: nginx could not be built statically with OpenSSL on Linux;
       the bug had appeared in 1.9.11.

       headers when using HTTP/2.
  * Bugfix: in the ngx_http_v2_module.
  * Security: invalid pointer dereference might occur during DNS server
       response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
       attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
       cause segmentation fault in a worker process (CVE-2016-0742).
  * Security: use-after-free condition might occur during CNAME response
       processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker
       who is able to trigger name resolution to cause segmentation fault in
       a worker process, or might have potential other impact
       (CVE-2016-0746).
  * Security: CNAME resolution was insufficiently limited if the
       "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to
       trigger arbitrary name resolution to cause excessive resource
       consumption in worker processes (CVE-2016-0747).
  * Feature: the "auto" parameter of the "worker_cpu_affinity" directive.
  * Bugfix: the "proxy_protocol" parameter of the "listen" directive did
       not work with IPv6 listen sockets.

  * Bugfix: proxying used the HTTP method of the original request after
       an "X-Accel-Redirect" redirection.
  * Bugfix: proxying to unix domain sockets did not work when using
       variables; the bug had appeared in 1.9.8.

  * Feature: the "proxy_cache_convert_head" directive.
  * Feature: the $realip_remote_addr variable in the
       ngx_http_realip_module.
  * Bugfix: the "expires" directive might not work when using variables.
  * Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
       using HTTP/2; the bug had appeared in 1.9.6.
  * Bugfix: if nginx was built with the ngx_http_v2_module it was
       possible to use the HTTP/2 protocol even if the "http2" parameter of
       the "listen" directive was not specified.
  * Bugfix: in the ngx_http_v2_module.
  * Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
       using HTTP/2.
       Thanks to Piotr Sikora and Denis Andzakovic.
  * Bugfix: the $server_protocol variable was empty when using HTTP/2.
  * Bugfix: backend SSL connections in the stream module might be timed
       out unexpectedly.

       different ssl_session_cache settings were used in different virtual
       servers.
