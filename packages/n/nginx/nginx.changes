-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 14:06:29 UTC 2022 - Michael Ströder <michael@stroeder.com>

- Updated to 1.23.2
  * Security: processing of a specially crafted mp4 file by the

- Updated to 1.23.0
  * https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES
  * Now header lines are represented as linked lists.
  * Now nginx combines arbitrary header lines with identical
    names when sending to FastCGI, SCGI, and uwsgi backends, in the
    $r->header_in() method of the ngx_http_perl_module, and during lookup
    of the "$http_...", "$sent_http_...", "$sent_trailer_...",
    "$upstream_http_...", and "$upstream_trailer_..." variables.
  * Fixed: if there were multiple "Vary" header lines in the backend
    response, nginx only used the last of them when caching.
  * Fixed: if there were multiple "WWW-Authenticate" header lines in the
    backend response and errors with code 401 were intercepted or the
    "auth_request" directive was used, nginx only sent the first of the
    header lines to the client.
  * The logging level of the "application data after close
    notify" SSL errors has been lowered from "crit" to "info".
  * Fixed: connections might hang if nginx was built on Linux 2.6.17 or
    newer, but was used on systems without EPOLLRDHUP support, notably
    with epoll emulation layers; the bug had appeared in 1.17.5.
  * Fixed: nginx did not cache the response if the "Expires" response
    header line disabled caching, but following "Cache-Control" header
    line enabled caching.

    client, but no supported protocols can be negotiated.
  * The default value of the "sendfile_max_chunk" directive was
    changed to 2 megabytes.
  * The "proxy_half_close" directive in the stream module.
  * The "ssl_alpn" directive in the stream module.
  * The $ssl_alpn_protocol variable.
  * Support for SSL_sendfile() when using OpenSSL 3.0.
  * The "mp4_start_key_frame" directive in the ngx_http_mp4_module.
  * In the $content_length variable when using chunked transfer encoding.
  * After receiving a response with incorrect length from a proxied
    backend nginx might nevertheless cache the connection.
  * Invalid headers from backends were logged at the "info" level
    instead of "error"; the bug had appeared in 1.21.1.
  * Requests might hang when using HTTP/2 and the "aio_write" directive.
