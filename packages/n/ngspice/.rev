    <comment>- Removed shared library header from non-shared devel package
- Build shared library version of ngspice using the multibuild
  feature.
  Building the shared library version of ngspice requires a separate
  build which doesn't build the binaries and doesn't allow to build 
  with the X Window System UI.
  Also it requires the package to be split in several sub-packages:
  * a package containing most of the ngspice binaries.
  * a package containing the shared library and a development
    package for applications using the ngspice API.
  * a code model package for Xspice and a development package
    for code models.
  * a scripts package
- Added -fpie and -pie to CFLAGS to ensure position independent
  executables.
- Update to version 27
  * check for correct inductor coefficients
  * add variable 'win_console'
  * --enable-relpath configure flag to set preprocessor flag HAS_RELPATH
  *    sets search path for spinit relativ to current directory
  * The search path for .spiceinit is: current dir, HOME dir, USERPROFILE dir
  * new function stddev to calculate the standard deviation of all elements 
    of a vector
  * xspice digital n-input x m-output look-up table gate
  * xspice digital model d_lut (digital n-input look-up table gate)
  * add variable $sharedmode (if shared ngspice is running), to be used in 
    scripts
  * enable msys2 for mingw compilation
  * OMP support for bsim3v3.24 model
  * bsim3v3.24: add model parameter lmlt (Channel length scaling)
  * OMP support for BSIM4.5 model
  * update and extension of command 'wrdata'
  * option xmu to set damping in trapezoid integration
  * command 'linearize' will take time data from transient analysis vector if 
    no circuit is loaded
  * two new commands: edisplay and eprvcd
  *     'edisplay' will show a list of all event nodes
  *     'eprvcd' will print all event nodes in vcd format
  * XSPICE 2D and 3D table models
  * add variable 'batchmode' which is set when command line option `-b' is 
    active
  * enable backquote substitution for Visual Studio console apps
  * update how-to-ngspice-vstudio.txt
  * update visualc directory and project files, add XSPICE code model 
    generation by VS2015
  * allow access to 4 GB memory of 32 bit ngspice on 64 bit Windows, 8 TB for 
    64 bit ngspice
  * new variable `interactive'
  * xspice, introduce cm_message_printf()
  * add variable `width' to command &quot;print line ...&quot;
  * support msys2
  * favor exponential temperatur equation if all parameters tc1, tc2 and tce 
    are given for R
  * move libfftw3 sideways out of the ngspice tree
  * remove visual studio 2008 .vcproj files
  * visualc/sharedspice.vcxproj, updated and migrated with visual studio 2015
  * `E..table {expr} {pairs}', `G..', allow an optional `=' after `table'
  * `E..value=', `G..value=', allow `=' being optional
  * introduce TCE, exponential temperature coefficient for R
  * allow `temper' to be recognised when preceded by '='
  * allow cross-compilation, especially for MinGW-w64
  * allow &quot;plot xlog ylog&quot; (equiv to &quot;plot loglog&quot;)
  * extend qa test to hisimhv version 2
  * update hisimhv model to version 2.2.0
  * update hisim model to version 2.8.0
  * .control variable &quot;sqrnoise&quot; to deliver noise data in squared 
    representation
  * noise analysis, deliver results in V/sqrt(Hz) and A/sqrt(Hz)
  * add delvt0 for bsim4 models
  * bug fixes for diode model
  * allow a xspice circuit with exclusively xspice event nodes
  * man pages for cmpp ngmakeidx and ngproc2mod
  * implement `nint()'
  * everywhere: ln to the base e, log to the base e, log10 to the base 10
  * allow an optional '=' in &quot;.func foo() = {expr}&quot;
  * bsim4, update to version 4.8
  * update hisimhv to version 1.2.4
  * cmc quality check for bsim3 model
  * nested indexing for vectors
  * option savecurrents to save current through all devices
  * option interp to plot interpolated raw file data
  * MS VS 2010 project file added for compatibility
  * XSPICE: new callback function cm_get_path
- ngspice-fix-warning.patch: Removed - obsolete.
- ngspice-gnuplot-terminal.patch replaced by
  ngspice-Use-gnuplot-terminal-auto-detection.patch
- Revert previous changes as this builds a shared engine only not
  executable binaries.
- Clean up spec file, fix license naming and update copyright year.
- Add verbose building with V=1.
- Add -fPIC and -fopenmp flags to Tumbleweed builds.
- enable shared lib build
- added sub package for shared lib and devel
- Update to version 26
  * fft command may use fftw3 library
  * add nint() rounding function
  * usage of 'temper' in behavioral devices
  * check for soa (safe operating area) in several device models
  * library processing rewritten completely to enhance ngspice
    compatibility (.lib)
  * include file processing rewritten to allow nesting and various
    absolute and relative path names (.inc)
  * asinh, acosh, atanh functions
  * shared ngspice option added: ngspice optionally compiles as
    a shared object or dynamic link library
  * use a hash table to massively speed up parsing the netlist
  * implement a very basic .if/.else block
  * implement a signed power function `pwr' for controlled sources
  * implement multiplier `m' in F, G source
  * apply Area Calculation Method (ACM) to the bsim3v3.3 model
  * implement `tc1', `tc2' instance parameters
- Split documentation to separate package
