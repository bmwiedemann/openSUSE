Tue Feb 14 19:18:01 UTC 2023 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Update to version 39:
  * New features:
    + ngspice now offers simulation with Verilog-A models, using
      its new OSDI interface and the OpenVAF model compiler. This
      enhancement enables access to all modern compact models for
      short channel MOS, FinFets, double gate transistors, SiGe
      bipolars, and III-V HEMTs.
    + ngspice now supports nearly all features of digital PSPICE
      compatible U devices (instances). Therefore we now may
      simulate a wealth of digital devices. These are translated
      into internal XSPICE event models, with very fast simulation.
    + For a list of additional new features please have a look at
      the NEWS feature in the ngspice tarball.
  * Patches: Many developer and user provided patches and bug
    fixes have been applied.

Sun May  6 23:45:52 UTC 2018 - stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de

- Removed shared library header from non-shared devel package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  5 15:22:21 UTC 2017 - eich@suse.com

- Build shared library version of ngspice using the multibuild
  feature.
  Building the shared library version of ngspice requires a separate
  build which doesn't build the binaries and doesn't allow to build 
  with the X Window System UI.
  Also it requires the package to be split in several sub-packages:
  * a package containing most of the ngspice binaries.
  * a package containing the shared library and a development
    package for applications using the ngspice API.
  * a code model package for Xspice and a development package
    for code models.
  * a scripts package
- Added -fpie and -pie to CFLAGS to ensure position independent
  executables.
