  <description>Explicit labeled networking for Linux

The NetLabel control utility, netlabelctl, is a command line program designed
to allow system administrators to configure the NetLabel system in the kernel.
The utility is based around different &quot;modules&quot; which correspond to the
different types of NetLabel commands supported by the kernel.
