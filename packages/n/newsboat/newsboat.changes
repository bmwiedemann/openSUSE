Fri Mar  3 23:15:42 UTC 2023 - Avindra Goolcharan <avindra@opensuse.org>

- Update to 2.30.1:
  * fixed build failure with curl 7.87. (#2297)
- Includes 2.30:
  Added:
  * In config, long lines can now be broken into multiple ones with.
    When parsing the config, Newsboat would remove the backslash and
    append the following line to the current one. Be careful when indenting
    the lines that follow the backslash, as the indentation will be included
    in the concatenated string; this can change the meaning of some commands,
    e.g. if the indentation ends up inside a regex (#2212) (Simon Farre)
  * article-feed operation, to go to the feed of the currently selected
    article. This can come in handy in query feeds (phire)
  * New placeholder for browser, %T, which is replaced by the title
    of the selected feed or item (#2224) (Aneesh)
  * Miniflux: fail on startup if credentials are wrong (#2220) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
  * Miniflux: support for API token authentication, which is available
    since Miniflux 2.0.21 and is the preferred authentication method
    : https://miniflux.app/docs/api.html#authentication
    See miniflux-token, miniflux-tokeneval, and miniflux-tokenfile settings (#2122)
  Changed:
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.62.0
  * When cleanup-on-quit is disabled and the cache contains unreachable
    feeds, print their number, and write their URLs to error-log (#1548) (Maximilian Winkler)
  * If an item contains enclosure(s) but doesn't specify their type(s),
    pick the last one (as Newsboat only displays a single enclosure
    per item). This won't always do the right thing, e.g. it could
    pick cover art instead of the podcast, but sometimes it will, so
    it's still better than nothing (#2050) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir SARI), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.10
  Fixed:
  * Atom: if an item doesn't specify the atom:author, use the field
    from the contained atom:source; if that's not specified either,
    use atom:author of the feed itself. This is dictated by RFC 4287
    §4.2.1 (#2256) (Lysander Trischler)
  Security:
  * Remove transitive dependency on the vulnerable time 0.1 crate:
    CVE-2020-26235 https://osv.dev/vulnerability/RUSTSEC-2020-0071
    (#2288) (Alexander Batischev, thanks to the prod from critkitten)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 15:37:07 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.29:
  Added:
    * New placeholder for browser, %t, which is replaced by the type of the URL
    (#1954)
  * contib: a script to reorder lines in the urls file (#1918)
  * Support for Brotli compression. In fact, Newsboat will now use all the methods
    supported by the libcurl it's linked to (#2152)
  * In tags dialog, put the cursor on the currently selected tag, or the first tag
    if none is selected at the moment (#2093)
  Changed:
  * When rendering an article, put a newline between consecutive <audio> and
    <video> tags (#2103)
  * When select-filter is used with an argument (e.g. from a macro), that
    argument is now used to look up a predefined filter by name. The old
    behaviour (applying the argument as filter) is still available by using
    set-filter instead (#2137)
  * When select-filter is used without an argument, it will now open the filter
    selection dialog. Previously, set-filter from a macro without arguments
    was ignored in the article list (#2137)
  * Docs: use a new style for keys. It should be more readable than the old one,
    please file issues if you disagree! (#2028)
  * When reloading feeds in parallel, status line now shows the progress rather
    than the number of the currently reloaded feed (#2065)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (Tonus), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian and
    Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Turkish (Emir SARI)
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.59.0
  * Bumped minimum supported GNU Make version to 4.0 (released on
    October 9th, 2013)
  * Updated vendored libraries: expected-lite to 0.6.2, json.hpp to 3.11.2
  Fixed:
  * Segfault on sqlite3DbMallocRawNN (#1980)
  * Scrolling when toggling show-read-feeds (#2138)
  * Feeds not reloading in parallel when reloading only visible feeds (#2067)
- Refresh:
  * newsbeuter-makefile.patch
  * newsboat-gcc12.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 14:01:33 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Add newsboat-gcc12.patch:
  Fix build with gcc12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 23 07:32:59 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- bsc#1196972: Bump rust regex to fixed version
- Update to 2.27:
  Added:
  * Support for regexes in `ignore-article`; for example, you can now use
    `ignore-article "https://nitter.net/.*" "title =~ \"RT by\""` to ignore all
    retweets in your Nitter feeds. This is more efficient than matching on
    `feedurl` from the filter expression, because this new form is only
    evaluated for the feeds that match the regex, while the old form would run
    for all articles of all feeds (#1913)
  * A "universal" color scheme
  * A user-contributed script to show images in Kitty terminal emulator:
    contrib/kitty-img-pager.sh
  * Support for XDG directories in contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py
  Changed:
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.55.0
  * We now link to our own STFL fork: https://github.com/newsboat/stfl. The
    upstream's SVN is down, and we never managed to get any of our bugfixes in
    there anyway. Since we seem to be the last remaining STFL user, we advise
    downstream maintainers to rely on our repo instead. Our fork is maintained to
    the extent necessary for Newsboat
  * In manpages, command line options are now set in bold and are underlined,
    while inline code is underlined. These changes improve readability
  * Clarified error messages in OPML import (#1919)
  * Updated translations
  * Updated vendored library json.hpp to 3.10.5, Catch2 to 2.13.8
  Fixed:
  * Cursor jumping too far after marking a feed read when hidden feeds are present
    (#1934)
  * Newsboat exiting with code 0 when OPML import fails
  * XML entities not being decoded in "text/plain" entries (#1938)
  * Crash when "ol" or "ul" tags are closed multiple times (#1974)
  * Confirmation and Q&A text being almost invisible with "nord" color scheme
  * Some invalid code in contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py
  * Blank lines inside tags not being preserved when inside a "pre" tag (#2003)
  * A potential crash in HTML entities decoding code
  Security:
  * Addressed CVE-2022-24713 (a.k.a. RUSTSEC-2022-0013) by updating "regex" crate
    to 1.5.5 (#2008)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan  4 15:58:35 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.26:
  Added:

  * `miniflux-min-items` setting to control how many articles to load for each
    feed
  * A script to bookmark articles to buku
  * A gruvbox color scheme
  Changed:
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.53.0
  * Accept empty feed title when bookmarking on autopilot (#243)
  * `:save` command now uses `save-path` setting to resolve relative paths (#1689)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian,
    Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), and Turkish (Emir Sari)
  * Updated vendored library optional-lite to 3.5.0, json.hpp to 3.10.4
  Removed:
  * Ability to switch away from modal dialogs (e.g. FileBrowser) (#117)
  Fixed:
  * Relative URLs in articles are now resolved relative to their permalink when
    the feed doesn't set the `xml:base` (#1818,
    https://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/issues/507)
  * Starred items not being synchronized to NextCloud News (#743)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  5 03:59:36 UTC 2021 - William Brown <william.brown@suse.com>

- Add cargo audit service to detect potential security issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 22 08:36:04 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.25:
  Added:
  * New elements to style with `color` command: `title`, `hint-key`,
    `hint-keys-delimiter`, `hint-separator`, and `hint-description`.
    If there is no style for one of those elements, the style of
    `info` is used instead. See "Configuring Colors" section in the
    docs
  * Podboat: show an error when a podcast can't be renamed (#545)
  * A note that the urls file can contain comments
  Changed:
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.51.0
  * Key hints (at the bottom of the screen) are now styled to make
    them easier to read. If you're using a custom colorscheme and
    want to use these new elements, you need to update it;
    see the "Configuring Colors" section in the docs (#1016)
  * Podboat: move to the next item after marking a podcast
    finished or deleted
  * `purge-deleted` now keeps the cursor near where it was in the
    list, rather than the *line* it was on (#1728)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin),
    Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian, Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev),
    and Turkish (Emir Sari)
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.7, and json.hpp to 3.10.2
  Fixed:
  * A crash when entering a feed with an invalid filter expression (#1665)
  * Slow scrolling in Podboat (#1375)
  * Slow `mark-all-read` with remote APIs. It's still slow when a
    filter is applied, but without a filter it's as fast as possible
  * A crash when `next-unread` is invoked while viewing a tag with no
    unread feeds (#1734)
  * A crash on feeds that contain wide characters (e.g. emojis)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 21 07:01:56 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.24:
  Added:
  * FreshRSS support
  * Ability to add descriptions to macros (#228)
  * Support for plain-text Atom entries (YouTube is the most
    prominent publisher of those) (#468, #1022, #1010)
  * restrict-filename setting to control if non-alphanumeric
    symbols will get replaced by underscores when saving an article (#1110)
  * highlight-feed setting to highlight feedlist entries according
    to the filter expressions (same as highlight-article in
    the article list) (#1510)
  Changed:
  * IRC channel moved from Freenode to Libera.Chat network
  * Newsboat will now fail to start if settings are passed more
  parameters than
    they expect. To fix this, read the doc for the setting and try using
    double
    quotes as necessary (Alexander Batischev)
  * Newsboat will now quit if you try to open a query feed whose
  expression
    contains an unknown attribute. This is a temporary workaround; the
    next
    version will display an error instead. The proper fix couldn't be
    added to
    2.24 because that'd disrupt the freeze on translations (#1665)
  * Updated translations
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.48.0
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.6
  Fixed:
  * Segfault in Podboat when purging the list where the last item is
    finished or deleted (#1546)
  * mark-feed-read applying to invisible items (e.g. the ones that are
    filtered out, or read ones when show-read-articles is in effect) (#1364)
  * Supplying garbage instead of a correct Newsboat version to FeedHQ
    and The Old Reader
  * Sorting in ascending order partially reversing the results of the
    previous sort (#1561)
  * Compile errors when building with a stack protector (#1598)
  * toggle-article-read ignoring its argument in macros when executed
    from an article view (#1637)
  * Article view scrolling back to top after opening a link (#1463)
  * The build system trying to find iconv() in libc instead of linking
    with libiconv

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  7 07:20:28 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.23:
  Added:
  * open-in-browser-noninteractively operation which is similar to
    open-in-browser, but doesn't relinquish the terminal to the browser. It
    still waits for the browser to finish executing, though (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Confirmation for delete-all-articles (#1490)
  * %U specifier for feedlist-title-format which shows the total number of
    unread articles in all feeds (#1495)
  * Display images' alternate text in the article view (#1512)
  * List iframe URLs in the article view (#1153)
  Changed:
  * Newsboat now refuses to enqueue a podcast if its filename is already present
    in the queue. If that happens, you'll have to adjust
    download-filename-format to make the filenames more distinguishable
    (#1411)
  * Reduced message flickering when reloading feeds (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander
    Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sari), and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.46.0
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.4
  Removed:
  * dumpform command-line command which was only intended for debugging
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:
  * Missing empty lines inside pre tags (#1429)
  * open-all-unread-in-browser-and-mark-read not synchronizing the "read" status
    to the remote API (#1449)
  * Newsboat redrawing the screen once a minute even if idle (#563)
  * delete-all-articles no longer deletes items that aren't visible (e.g.
    because of ignore-mode display) (#1360)
  * Slashes are now replaced by underscores when generating a podcast filename
    (#836)
  * File- and dirbrowsers no longer produce invalid paths when user navigates with
    arrow keys (#1418)
  * Successful OPML import is no longer misreported as an error (Alexander
    Batischev)
  * Descriptions in the help dialog are localized again (#1471)
  * Added a newline after each div, since it's a block element (#1405)
  * Re-introduce set x! (toggle) and set x& (reset) (#1491)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 11 08:55:05 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.22.1:
  * Slow scrolling in the article list (regression) (#1372)
  * Segfaults if swap-title-and-hints is enabled (regression) (#1399)
  * Build failure on GCC 9 due to maybe-uninitialized warning which
    -Werror turns into an error

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 10:26:19 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.22:
  Added:
  * confirm-mark-all-feeds-read setting, which makes Newsboat ask for
    confirmation before marking all the feeds as read (#1215) (Tarishi Jain)
  * Command line autocompletion in the save dialog (#893) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Support for ^U, ^K, ^G, and ^W editing keys (as in readline and Emacs) in
    command line in the save dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Support for RSS Media extension in Atom feeds (#595) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New, more detailed, documentation chapters on macros and running external
    commands (A1RO)
  * User-contributed script that exports feeds with their tags in the OPML format:
    contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (jartigag)
  * Help dialog in the URLs view (#1218) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Handling of terminal resizes for all dialogs (#389, #390) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * goto-title operation, which selects a feed with a given title (#888, #1135)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * --cleanup command-line flag, which does the same as cleanup-on-quit
    option (#1182) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * check and ci-check Makefile targets. Both run C++ and Rust test suites
    consecutively, but the former fails early. Use check locally where
    re-running tests is quick, and use ci-check in CI where re-running tests
    usually means re-building everything first (#896) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Command line support in the help dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * "(localized)" marks in documentation for all settings with internationalized
    default values (#1270) (Amrit Brar)
  * %F placeholder in browser setting, which is always replaced by the
    feed's URL (unlike %u, which depends on the context in which the browser
    is invoked) (#423) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Dumping of ignore-article rules with dumpconfig command (in Newsboat's
    internal command line) (#635) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * %L placeholder in datetime-format setting, which turns into "X days ago"
    string explaining when the article was published (#1323) (Amrit Brar)
  * Support for escaped double quotes in arguments to set operation when used in
    macros (#1345) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Podboat: error message if the podcast file can't be written onto disk (#1209)
    (Nicholas Defranco)
  Changed:
  * Abort startup if the urls file or config file is not in UTF-8 encoding. This
    limitation was effectively in place for a couple releases already, but
    Newsboat crashed instead of displaying an error message. We intend to relax
    the requirement again, but for now, we choose to be upfront about it rather
    than crashing (#723, #844) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev)
  * save-all operation no longer provides "yes for all" and "no for all" options
    when there is only one conflict to resolve (#657) (saleh)
  * Config parser now allows to have tab characters between macro arguments;
    they will be treated as space (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.3, martinmoene/optional-lite
    to 3.4.0, martinmoene/expected-lite to 0.5.0
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (tkerdonc), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sarı), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  Fixed:
  * Whitespace not being consolidated in item titles (#1227) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Misleading error message when the urls file exists, but can't be opened (#439)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Newsboat processing the leftovers of stdin after running open-in-browser
    operation (#26, #63, #1094) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * mark-feed-read operation not marking articles as read on a remote service
    when the operation is invoked in the query feed (#220) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * run-on-startup setting preventing Podboat from starting (#1288) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * scrolloff setting being ignored when opening a feed with lots of read
    articles before the unread one (#1293) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Memory corruption while rendering an article with JavaScript that contains
    HTML (#1300) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Podboat help dialog crashing if BACKSPACE is bound (#1139) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Being unable to run a second Newsboat instance with --cache-file switch if
    cache-file setting is used (#1318) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Misleading "an instance is already running" message when a lock file can't be
    created or written to (#314) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Failing to parse macros which contain semicolons in operations' arguments
    (#1200) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Not installing some of the contrib scripts (Alexander Batischev)

    (#1081]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Search dialogs all displaying results of the last search, not their individual
    searches (#1087]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Feeds apparently not being sorted after a reload (#1089]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Search dialog displaying the new query even if the search failed (Dennis van
    der Schagt)

- Update to 2.20.1:
  Fixed:
  * Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
  * Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made set browser "lynx"; open-in-browser invalid (#1013], #1015],
    #1017], #1018]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Possible segfault upon startup (#1025]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander

  * New format specifier for feedlist-title-format,
    articlelist-title-format, and searchresult-title-format: %F, which
    contains current filter expression. That specifier is now included into
    those settings by default (#946[3]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, switch-focus, which specifies a key that moves the cursor
    between widgets in File- and DirBrowser (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, wrap-scroll, which makes the cursor jump to the last item

  (#892[4]) (Marco Sirabella)
  * Dependency on martinmoene/optional-lite and martinmoene/expected-lite
    libraries, both of which we vendor
  * Include enclosure URL in the article's urlview (#809[5]) (Spacewalker2,
  Alexander Batischev)
  * Allow open-in-browser and open-in-browser-and-mark-read operations in the
    URL view, where they open the selected URL (David Pedersen)

  Changed:

    Trischler), Russian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Marcos Cruz), Turkish
    (Emir Sari), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  * It's now an error to have always-download or reset-unread-on-update
    without parameters (Alexander Batischev)
  * It's now an error to have macro without at least two arguments (Alexander
    Batischev)
  * The conditional format sequence (%?[char]?[format]&[format]?) now treats
    whitespace-only value as empty. This allows changing the formatting of,
    for example, "unread" and "deleted" fields in articlelist-format (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * open-in-browser-and-mark-read in feedlist no longer marks articles read
    if the browser fails (Nikos Tsipinakis)

  Removed:
  * Newsboat's Inoreader API keys. Users need to register their own Inoreader
    application now, and set them via inoreader-app-id and inoreader-app-key
    settings. Please see "Inoreader" section in the HTML documentation for
    details. (Alexander Batischev)
  Fixed:
  * Help dialog showing operations as unbound even though they are bound to
    some keys (#843[8]) (Dennis van der Schagt)

    Batischev)

    date and time (Alexander Batischev)
  * browser setting not working if it contains < (#917[9]) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * up, down, pageup, pagedown, home, and end now working in macros
    (#890[10]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Backslash inside double quotes requiring three escapes instead of one,
    every other time (#536[11], #642[12], #926[13]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Users can bind operations to UP, DOWN, HOME, END, NPAGE, and PPAGE
    keys (#903[14]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Generate example config as part of doc target, so install-examples can
    simply copy it instead of generating (Alexander Batischev)
  * Install manpages via install-docs target, not install-newsboat and
    install-podboat (#829[15]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * The wrong feed being opened (#72[16]) turned out to be caused by a bug in
    libstfl.  A patch for that library is available at dennisschagt/stfl#4

    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
  * `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the

  * The EOT markers ("~" characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
    style (colors + attributes) from the "article" style. Instead, they can be

    (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
