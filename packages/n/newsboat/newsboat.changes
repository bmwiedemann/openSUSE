Tue Jun  9 15:07:47 UTC 2020 - Guillaume GARDET <guillaume.gardet@opensuse.org>

- Fix build on non-x86:
  * newsboat-fix-json-hpp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 23 08:59:21 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
  * `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
    human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
    GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
  * Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
  * Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive
  Changed:

  *  Dependency on Rust: we now have a schedule for bumping the minimum supported
     Rust version (#709)
  * Update vendored version of Catch2 to 2.11.3
  * Display `<audio>` and `<video>` tags in article view (Ignacio Losiggio)
  * Update translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander

    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
  * The EOT markers ("~" characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
    style (colors + attributes) from the "article" style. Instead, they can be
    configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
    (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:
  * **Breaking change**: `bind-key` context `podbeuter` renamed to `podboat`

    der Schagt created a patch and submitted it upstream on 7 March 2020, but

    (Alexander Batischev)

    formatting (#796) (Dennis van der Schagt)

    der Schagt)
  * "Filler sequence" (`%>`) not working in format strings for articlelist,
    dialogs, help, select-tag, select-filter and urls dialogs (#88) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * Cursor in Podboat is hidden (Dennis van der Schagt)
