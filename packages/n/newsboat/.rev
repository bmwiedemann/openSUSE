  Added:
  * Logo by noobilanderi
  Changed:

    <comment>- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
  * `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
    human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
    GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
  * Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
  * Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive

    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
  * The EOT markers (&quot;~&quot; characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
    style (colors + attributes) from the &quot;article&quot; style. Instead, they can be
    configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
    (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:

    <comment>- Update to 2.20.1:
  Fixed:
  * Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
  * Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made set browser &quot;lynx&quot;; open-in-browser invalid (#1013[1], #1015[2],
    #1017[3], #1018[4]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Possible segfault upon startup (#1025[5]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)
  * Feed sorting in Spanish locale (#1028[6]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)

- Update to 2.20:
  Added:
  * An FAQ item on why TT-RSS authentication might fail (#44[1]) (Alexander
    Batischev)
  * An FAQ item on browser failures in Newsboat 2.18 (Alexander Batischev)
  * Ability to bind multiple keys to the same operation (#110[2]) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * Ability to bind operations to Tab key (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifiers for articlelist-format: %n (article unread), %d
    (article deleted), %F (article's flags) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifier for feedlist-title-format,
    articlelist-title-format, and searchresult-title-format: %F, which
    contains current filter expression. That specifier is now included into
    those settings by default (#946[3]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, switch-focus, which specifies a key that moves the cursor
    between widgets in File- and DirBrowser (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, wrap-scroll, which makes the cursor jump to the last item
    when scrolling up on the top one, and vice versa (David Pedersen)
  * exec command-line command, which allows to run an arbitrary operation</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 2.21:
  Added:
  * Build dependency on AWK
  * A note that security vulnerability should be reported to
    security@newsboat.org preferably encrypted to PGP key 4ED6CD61932B9EBE
  * Confirmation before marking all feeds as read (#1006) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * scrolloff setting which keeps the specified number of lines above and below
    the selected list item (#1103) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * %=[width][identifier] formatting sequence for *-format settings. It
    centers a given value inside a given width, padded with spaces and slanting
    to the left if it can't be aligned evenly (Daniel Bauer)
  * Support for Miniflux (#448) (Galen Abell)
  * run-on-startup setting which executes a given list of operations when
    Newsboat starts. This can be used to e.g. open tag dialog on startup, or go
    to a certain feed (#888) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Documentation for one, two, ..., nine, zero operations that open
    a corresponding URL in the browser (A1RO)
  Changed:
  * It is now a startup error for a macro to have no operations
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.42.0
  * Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.1, json.hpp to 3.9.1
  * Empty strings in filter expressions are treated as zero when compared with
    a numeric attribute like age (Alexander Batischev)
  * Converted various tables in docs to decorated lists, making them easier to
    read (#441]) (Spacewalker2)
  * In macros, no longer require a space between operation and the following
    semicolon (#702]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Sorting by first tag now ignores &quot;title tags&quot;, i.e. the ones that start with
    a tilde (#1128]) (José Rui Barros)
  * contrib/feedgrabber.rb updated to use Newsboat directories instead of</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 2.22:
  Added:
  * confirm-mark-all-feeds-read setting, which makes Newsboat ask for
    confirmation before marking all the feeds as read (#1215) (Tarishi Jain)
  * Command line autocompletion in the save dialog (#893) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Support for ^U, ^K, ^G, and ^W editing keys (as in readline and Emacs) in
    command line in the save dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Support for RSS Media extension in Atom feeds (#595) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New, more detailed, documentation chapters on macros and running external
    commands (A1RO)
  * User-contributed script that exports feeds with their tags in the OPML format:
    contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (jartigag)
  * Help dialog in the URLs view (#1218) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Handling of terminal resizes for all dialogs (#389, #390) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * goto-title operation, which selects a feed with a given title (#888, #1135)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * --cleanup command-line flag, which does the same as cleanup-on-quit
    option (#1182) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * check and ci-check Makefile targets. Both run C++ and Rust test suites
    consecutively, but the former fails early. Use check locally where
    re-running tests is quick, and use ci-check in CI where re-running tests
    usually means re-building everything first (#896) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Command line support in the help dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * &quot;(localized)&quot; marks in documentation for all settings with internationalized
    default values (#1270) (Amrit Brar)
  * %F placeholder in browser setting, which is always replaced by the
    feed's URL (unlike %u, which depends on the context in which the browser
    is invoked) (#423) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Dumping of ignore-article rules with dumpconfig command (in Newsboat's
    internal command line) (#635) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * %L placeholder in datetime-format setting, which turns into &quot;X days ago&quot;
    string explaining when the article was published (#1323) (Amrit Brar)
  * Support for escaped double quotes in arguments to set operation when used in
    macros (#1345) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Podboat: error message if the podcast file can't be written onto disk (#1209)
    (Nicholas Defranco)
  Changed:
  * Abort startup if the urls file or config file is not in UTF-8 encoding. This
    limitation was effectively in place for a couple releases already, but
    Newsboat crashed instead of displaying an error message. We intend to relax
    the requirement again, but for now, we choose to be upfront about it rather
    than crashing (#723, #844) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev)
  * save-all operation no longer provides &quot;yes for all&quot; and &quot;no for all&quot; options
    when there is only one conflict to resolve (#657) (saleh)
  * Config parser now allows to have tab characters between macro arguments;
    they will be treated as space (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.3, martinmoene/optional-lite
    to 3.4.0, martinmoene/expected-lite to 0.5.0
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (tkerdonc), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sarı), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  Fixed:
  * Whitespace not being consolidated in item titles (#1227) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Misleading error message when the urls file exists, but can't be opened (#439)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Newsboat processing the leftovers of stdin after running open-in-browser
    operation (#26, #63, #1094) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * mark-feed-read operation not marking articles as read on a remote service
    when the operation is invoked in the query feed (#220) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * run-on-startup setting preventing Podboat from starting (#1288) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * scrolloff setting being ignored when opening a feed with lots of read
    articles before the unread one (#1293) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Memory corruption while rendering an article with JavaScript that contains
    HTML (#1300) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Podboat help dialog crashing if BACKSPACE is bound (#1139) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Being unable to run a second Newsboat instance with --cache-file switch if
    cache-file setting is used (#1318) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Misleading &quot;an instance is already running&quot; message when a lock file can't be
    created or written to (#314) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Failing to parse macros which contain semicolons in operations' arguments
    (#1200) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Not installing some of the contrib scripts (Alexander Batischev)

    <comment>- Update to 2.23:
  Added:
  * open-in-browser-noninteractively operation which is similar to
    open-in-browser, but doesn't relinquish the terminal to the browser. It
    still waits for the browser to finish executing, though (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
  * Confirmation for delete-all-articles (#1490)
  * %U specifier for feedlist-title-format which shows the total number of
    unread articles in all feeds (#1495)
  * Display images' alternate text in the article view (#1512)
  * List iframe URLs in the article view (#1153)
  Changed:
  * Newsboat now refuses to enqueue a podcast if its filename is already present
    in the queue. If that happens, you'll have to adjust
    download-filename-format to make the filenames more distinguishable
    (#1411)
  * Reduced message flickering when reloading feeds (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander
    Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sari), and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.46.0
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.4
  Removed:
  * dumpform command-line command which was only intended for debugging
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:
  * Missing empty lines inside pre tags (#1429)
  * open-all-unread-in-browser-and-mark-read not synchronizing the &quot;read&quot; status
    to the remote API (#1449)
  * Newsboat redrawing the screen once a minute even if idle (#563)</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 2.24:
  Added:
  * FreshRSS support
  * Ability to add descriptions to macros (#228)
  * Support for plain-text Atom entries (YouTube is the most
    prominent publisher of those) (#468, #1022, #1010)
  * restrict-filename setting to control if non-alphanumeric
    symbols will get replaced by underscores when saving an article (#1110)
  * highlight-feed setting to highlight feedlist entries according
    to the filter expressions (same as highlight-article in
    the article list) (#1510)
  Changed:
  * IRC channel moved from Freenode to Libera.Chat network
  * Newsboat will now fail to start if settings are passed more
  parameters than
    they expect. To fix this, read the doc for the setting and try using
    double
    quotes as necessary (Alexander Batischev)
  * Newsboat will now quit if you try to open a query feed whose
  expression
    contains an unknown attribute. This is a temporary workaround; the
    next
    version will display an error instead. The proper fix couldn't be
    added to
    2.24 because that'd disrupt the freeze on translations (#1665)
  * Updated translations
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.48.0
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.6

    <comment>- Update to 2.25:
  Added:
  * New elements to style with `color` command: `title`, `hint-key`,
    `hint-keys-delimiter`, `hint-separator`, and `hint-description`.
    If there is no style for one of those elements, the style of
    `info` is used instead. See &quot;Configuring Colors&quot; section in the
    docs
  * Podboat: show an error when a podcast can't be renamed (#545)
  * A note that the urls file can contain comments
  Changed:
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.51.0
  * Key hints (at the bottom of the screen) are now styled to make
    them easier to read. If you're using a custom colorscheme and
    want to use these new elements, you need to update it;
    see the &quot;Configuring Colors&quot; section in the docs (#1016)
  * Podboat: move to the next item after marking a podcast
    finished or deleted
  * `purge-deleted` now keeps the cursor near where it was in the
    list, rather than the *line* it was on (#1728)
  * Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin),
    Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian, Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev),
    and Turkish (Emir Sari)
  * Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.7, and json.hpp to 3.10.2
  Fixed:
  * A crash when entering a feed with an invalid filter expression (#1665)
  * Slow scrolling in Podboat (#1375)
  * Slow `mark-all-read` with remote APIs. It's still slow when a
    filter is applied, but without a filter it's as fast as possible
  * A crash when `next-unread` is invoked while viewing a tag with no</comment>

    feed

  * A gruvbox color scheme

  * Relative URLs in articles are now resolved relative to their permalink when
    the feed doesn't set the `xml:base` (#1818,
