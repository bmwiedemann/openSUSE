  Added:
  * Logo by noobilanderi
  Changed:
  * `open-in-browser-and-mark-read` no longer marks item read if browser returned

    <comment>- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
  * `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
    human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
    GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
  * Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
  * Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive
  Changed:

    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
  * The EOT markers (&quot;~&quot; characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
    style (colors + attributes) from the &quot;article&quot; style. Instead, they can be
    configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
    (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:
  * **Breaking change**: `bind-key` context `podbeuter` renamed to `podboat`

    <comment>- Update to 2.20.1:
  Fixed:
  * Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
  * Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made set browser &quot;lynx&quot;; open-in-browser invalid (#1013[1], #1015[2],
    #1017[3], #1018[4]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Possible segfault upon startup (#1025[5]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)
  * Feed sorting in Spanish locale (#1028[6]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)

- Update to 2.20:
  Added:
  * An FAQ item on why TT-RSS authentication might fail (#44[1]) (Alexander
    Batischev)
  * An FAQ item on browser failures in Newsboat 2.18 (Alexander Batischev)
  * Ability to bind multiple keys to the same operation (#110[2]) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * Ability to bind operations to Tab key (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifiers for articlelist-format: %n (article unread), %d
    (article deleted), %F (article's flags) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifier for feedlist-title-format,
    articlelist-title-format, and searchresult-title-format: %F, which
    contains current filter expression. That specifier is now included into
    those settings by default (#946[3]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, switch-focus, which specifies a key that moves the cursor
    between widgets in File- and DirBrowser (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, wrap-scroll, which makes the cursor jump to the last item
    when scrolling up on the top one, and vice versa (David Pedersen)
  * exec command-line command, which allows to run an arbitrary operation</comment>
