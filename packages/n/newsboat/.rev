  Added:
  * Logo by noobilanderi
  Changed:
  * `open-in-browser-and-mark-read` no longer marks item read if browser returned

    <comment>- Update to 2.19:
  Added:
  * contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
  * `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
    human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
    GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
  * Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
  * Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive
  Changed:

    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
  * The EOT markers (&quot;~&quot; characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
    style (colors + attributes) from the &quot;article&quot; style. Instead, they can be
    configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
    (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
  Fixed:
  * **Breaking change**: `bind-key` context `podbeuter` renamed to `podboat`

    <comment>- Update to 2.20.1:
  Fixed:
  * Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
  * Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made set browser &quot;lynx&quot;; open-in-browser invalid (#1013[1], #1015[2],
    #1017[3], #1018[4]) (Alexander Batischev)
  * Possible segfault upon startup (#1025[5]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)
  * Feed sorting in Spanish locale (#1028[6]) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander
    Batischev)

- Update to 2.20:
  Added:
  * An FAQ item on why TT-RSS authentication might fail (#44[1]) (Alexander
    Batischev)
  * An FAQ item on browser failures in Newsboat 2.18 (Alexander Batischev)
  * Ability to bind multiple keys to the same operation (#110[2]) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
  * Ability to bind operations to Tab key (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifiers for articlelist-format: %n (article unread), %d
    (article deleted), %F (article's flags) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New format specifier for feedlist-title-format,
    articlelist-title-format, and searchresult-title-format: %F, which
    contains current filter expression. That specifier is now included into
    those settings by default (#946[3]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, switch-focus, which specifies a key that moves the cursor
    between widgets in File- and DirBrowser (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * New setting, wrap-scroll, which makes the cursor jump to the last item
    when scrolling up on the top one, and vice versa (David Pedersen)
  * exec command-line command, which allows to run an arbitrary operation</comment>

    <comment>- Update to 2.21:
  Added:
  * Build dependency on AWK
  * A note that security vulnerability should be reported to
    security@newsboat.org preferably encrypted to PGP key 4ED6CD61932B9EBE
  * Confirmation before marking all feeds as read (#1006) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * scrolloff setting which keeps the specified number of lines above and below
    the selected list item (#1103) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * %=[width][identifier] formatting sequence for *-format settings. It
    centers a given value inside a given width, padded with spaces and slanting
    to the left if it can't be aligned evenly (Daniel Bauer)
  * Support for Miniflux (#448) (Galen Abell)
  * run-on-startup setting which executes a given list of operations when
    Newsboat starts. This can be used to e.g. open tag dialog on startup, or go
    to a certain feed (#888) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Documentation for one, two, ..., nine, zero operations that open
    a corresponding URL in the browser (A1RO)
  Changed:
  * It is now a startup error for a macro to have no operations
  * Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.42.0
  * Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.1, json.hpp to 3.9.1
  * Empty strings in filter expressions are treated as zero when compared with
    a numeric attribute like age (Alexander Batischev)
  * Converted various tables in docs to decorated lists, making them easier to
    read (#441]) (Spacewalker2)
  * In macros, no longer require a space between operation and the following
    semicolon (#702]) (Dennis van der Schagt)
  * Sorting by first tag now ignores &quot;title tags&quot;, i.e. the ones that start with
    a tilde (#1128]) (José Rui Barros)
  * contrib/feedgrabber.rb updated to use Newsboat directories instead of</comment>
