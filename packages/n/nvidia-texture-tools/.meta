  <title>NVIDIA Texture Tools</title>
  <description>This is the first alpha release of the new NVIDIA Texture Tools. The main highlights of 
this release are support for all DX10 texture formats, higher speed and improved
compression quality.

In addition to that it also comes with a hardware accelerated compressor that 
uses CUDA to compress blocks in parallel on the GPU and runs around 10 times 
faster than the CPU counterpart.

You can obtain CUDA from our developer site at:

The source code of the Texture Tools is being released under the terms of 
the MIT license.</description>
