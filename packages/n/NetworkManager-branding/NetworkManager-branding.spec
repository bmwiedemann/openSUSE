%description
NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available
at all times.  The point of NetworkManager is to make networking
configuration and setup as painless and automatic as possible.	If
using DHCP, NetworkManager is intended to replace default routes,
obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server, and change name servers
whenever it sees fit.

This package provides the default %{branding_name} configuration for
%{_sysconfdir}/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, configured to
check connectivity against http://conncheck.opensuse.org.
