  <title>nmtree - Utility for mapping directory hierarchies</title>
  <description>The nmtree utility compares the file hierarchy rooted in the currentdirectory against a specification read from the standard input. Messages are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics do not match the specification, or which are missing from either the file hierarchy or the specification.</description>
