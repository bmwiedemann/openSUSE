  <title>Nextcloud desktop synchronisation client</title>
  <description>The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronise files from the Nextcloud Server with your computer.

Nextcloud Desktop enables you to connect to your private Nextcloud Server.
With it you can create directories in your home directory, and keep the contents of those directories synced with the server.
Simply copy a file into the directory and the desktop synchronisation client does the rest.</description>
