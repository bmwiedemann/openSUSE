- Split out the dbus service related files that provides
  libcloudproviders integration for nextcloud desktop client into
  a separate package; when this is installed, launching any
  app supporting libowncloudproviders (e.g. nautilus on GNOME)
  will automatically launch the desktop client -- which is rather
  annoying to happen by default, esp. in cases where a user does
  not even have a nextcloud account (gh#nextcloud/desktop#1982,
  gh#nextcloud/desktop#2622).
