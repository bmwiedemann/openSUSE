- Update to new upstream release 0.8
  * This release contains new features available up to the
    (upcoming) Linux 4.14 kernel release:
  * Support for stateful objects, these objects are uniquely
    identified by a user-defined name, you can refer to them from
    rules, and there is a well established interface to operate
    with them.
  * Sort set elements when listing them, from lower to largest.
  * TCP option matching and mangling support. This includes TCP
    maximum segment size mangling.
  * Add new "-s" option for listings without stateful information.
  * Add new -c/--check option for nft, to tests if your ruleset
    loads fine, into the kernel, this is a dry run mode.
  * Connection tracking helper support.
  * Add --echo option, to print the handle that the kernel
    allocates to uniquely identify rules.
  * Conntrack zone support
  * Symmetric hash support
  * Add support to include directories from nft natives scripts,
    files are loaded in alphanumerical order.
  * Allow to check if IPv6 extension header or TCP option exists
    or is missing.
  * Extend quota support to display used bytes.
  * Add ct average matching, to match average bytes per packet a
    connection has transferred so far, to map the existing
    feature available in the iptables connbytes match.
  * Allow to flush maps and flow tables.
  * Allow to embed set definition into an existing set.
  * Conntrack event filtering support via rule.

    or destination address of a packet.
  * Support hashing of any arbitrary key combination, eg.
  * Add number generation support. Useful for round-robin packet
    mark setting.
  * Add quota support, eg.
  * Introduce routing expression, for routing related data with
    support for nexthop
  * Notrack support, to explicitly skip connection tracking for
    matching packets.
  * Support to set non-byte bound packet header fields, including
    checksum adjustment.
  * Add 'create set' and 'create element' commands.
  * Allow to use variable reference for set element definitions.
  * Allow to use variable definitions from element commands.
  * Add support to flush set. You can use this new command to
    remove all existing elements in a set.
  * Inverted set lookups.
  * Honor absolute and relative paths via include file, where:
  * Support log flags, to enable logging TCP sequence and options.
  * tc classid parser support, eg.
  * Allow numeric connlabels, so if connlabel still works with
    undefined labels.
