- Require the same version ppp at runtime as we had during build
  time. We got away with the missing Requires as NM itself requires
  ppp, so 'a version' was always installed at least. But we need to
  guarantee the version at runtime matches the one we built against
  (boo#1175106).

- Update to version 1.12.10:
  + Add support for specifying the realm.
  + libnm-glib compatibility (NetworkManager < 1.0) is disabled by
    default. It can be enabled by passing --with-libnm-glib to
    configure script. Nobody should need it by now. Users that
    still use this are encouraged to let us know before the
    libnm-glib support is removed for good.
  + The auth helper in external UI mode can now be run without a
    display server. Future nmcli version will utilize this for
    handling the secrets without a graphical desktop.
