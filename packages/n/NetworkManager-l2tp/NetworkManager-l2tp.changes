  pkgconfig(libnm-util) BuildRequires.

  * Stops strongSwan service when a connection cannot be
    established.
- Changes from version 1.2.6:
  * Prefer building against stable libsecret API.

    done to ensures L2TP is encapsulated in IPsec.

    usable by nmcli and a UI plugin for nm-applet and gnome

- Changes from version 1.0.6:
  * If L2TP port 1701 is already in use, no longer writes
    "leftprotoport=udp/l2tp" (which is equivalent to
    "leftprotoport=udp/1701") to the ipsec config file. This was
    done to ensures L2TP is encapsulated in IPsec.
  * Uses UUID instead of PID for run-time generated filenames
  * No longer temporarily replaces system /etc/ipsec.secrets file
  * IPsec rekeying is now possible because the following file
