- Drop build-dependency on libgcrypt-cavs: no longer existing with
  libgcrypt 1.10.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 15:43:57 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.37:
  * Fix uninitialized field in message objects.
  * Add one sided lastmod ranges for sexp queries.
  * Expand macro parameters inside regex and wildcard modifiers.
  * `notmuch help` now works for external commands.
  * `NOTMUCH_CONFIG` is now passed to external commands and hooks.
  * The function `notmuch-mua-mail` now moves point depending on the
  * provided arguments.
  * Restrict what mime types are inlined in replies and on refresh.
  * The functions in notmuch-query.el are now obsolete and may be removed
  * in a future version of Notmuch.
  * Add some controls for lazy display of message bodies (See "Dealing
  * with large messages and threads" in the notmuch-emacs documentation).
  * Allow the user to select (with '%') a different duplicate message file
  * to display.
  * Use `message-dont-reply-to-names` in `notmuch-message-mode`.
  * Add the `sexp` prefix to the infix (traditional) query parser. This
  * allows specific subqueries to be parsed by the sexp parser (with
  * appropropriate quoting). See `notmuch-search-terms(7)` for details.
  * Add another heuristic to regexp fields to prevent phrase parsing of
  * bracketed sub-expressions.
  * Envelope from ("From ") headers are now escaped as X-Envelope-From: in
  * input to `notmuch-insert`. This prevents creating mbox files when
  * calling `notmuch-insert` from e.g. `postfix`.
  * Use the `config_pairs` API in ConfigIterator. This returns all
  * matching key-value pairs, not just those that happen to be stored in
  * the database.
  * Reorganize documention for `notmuch-config`. Add a few links from
  * other man pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new in notmuch 0.34.1
=========================

Library
-------

Fix for deallocation and nulling of output parameter for
notmuch_database_{open_with,create_with,load}_config when errors
occur. This change fixes a potential use-after-free bug that has been
present since 0.32. This release also improves the documentation of
status returns for the same 3 functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 22 08:03:40 UTC 2021 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 0.34

What's new in notmuch 0.34
=========================

General
-------

An optional new s-expression based query parser is available if
notmuch is built with the `sfsexp` library. See
notmuch-sexp-queries(7) for syntax, and use `notmuch config get
built_with.sexpr_queries` to check if notmuch is compiled with
s-expression query support.

CLI
---

Support multiple `Delivered-To` headers in notmuch-reply(1).

Emacs
-----

Functions are now allowed in `notmuch-search-result-format`.

Improvements to unthreaded view on large threads.

Tolerate bad/missing working directory for most commands.

Allow customization of tree drawing symbols in notmuch-tree mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 13 10:02:59 UTC 2021 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 0.33.1

What's new in notmuch 0.33.1
=========================

General
-------

Replace the fully-qualified-domain-name of the host with "localhost"
in the default email address.  This should fix two flaky subtests in
T590-libconfig.


What's new in notmuch 0.33
=========================

Library
-------

Correct documentatation about transactions.

Add a configurable automatic commit of transactions. See
`database.autocommit` in notmuch-config(1).

Document the algorithm used to find a database.

CLI
---

Define format version 5, which supports sorting the output of
notmuch-show.

Emacs
-----

`notmuch` no longer sets `mail-user-agent` on load. To restore the
previous behaviour of using notmuch to send mail by default, customize
`mail-user-agent` to `notmuch-user-agent`.

`notmuch-company` now works in `org-msg`.

Improve the display of messages from long threads in unthreaded mode.

Prefer email addresses over User ID when showing valid signatures.

Define a new face `notmuch-jump-key`.

New commands in notmuch-tree view: `notmuch-tree-filter` and `notmuch-tree-filter-by-tag`.

Honour `notmuch-show-text/html-blocked-images` when using `w3m` to
render html.

Support toggling sort order in notmuch-tree mode.

Ruby
----

Memory management of allocated notmuch objects (database, messages,
etc...) is now done via the Ruby GC. This removes all constraints on
the order of object destruction.  Database close and destroy are
split, following an old library API change.

Vim
---

Respect excluded tags when showing a thread.

Documentation
-------------

Fix doc build for Sphinx 4.0.

Improve the markup and linking of the documentation.

Mon May 17 10:49:07 UTC 2021 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

What's new in notmuch 0.32.1
=========================

General
-------

Restore handling of relative values for `database.path` that was
broken by 0.32. Extend this handling to `database.mail_root`,
`database.backup_dir`, and `database.hook_dir`.

Reload certain metadata from Xapian database in
notmuch_database_reopen. This fixes a bug when adding messages to the
database in a pre-new hook.

Fix default of `$HOME/mail` for `database.path`. In release 0.32, this
default worked only in "notmuch config".

Emacs
-----

Restore the dynamically bound variables `tag-changes` and `query` in
in `notmuch-before-tag-hook` and `notmuch-after-tag-hook`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  5 05:25:32 UTC 2021 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

What's new in notmuch 0.32
=========================

General
-------

This release includes a significant overhaul of the configuration
management facilities for notmuch.  The previous distinction between
configuration items that can be modified via plain text configuration
files and those that must be set in the database via the "notmuch
config" subcommand is gone, and all configuration items can be set in
both ways.  The external configuration file overrides configuration
items in the database. The location of database, hooks, and
configuration files is now more flexible, with several new
configuration variables. In particular XDG locations are now supported
as fallbacks for database, configuration and hooks. For more
information see `notmuch-config(1)`.

Library
-------

To support the new configuration facilities, several functions and
constants have been added to the notmuch API. Most notably:

- `notmuch_database_create_with_config`
- `notmuch_database_open_with_config`
- `notmuch_database_load_config`
- `notmuch_config_get`

A previously requested API change is that `notmuch_database_reopen` is
now exposed (and generalized).

The previously severe slowdowns from large numbers calls to
notmuch_database_remove_message or notmuch_message_delete in one
session has been fixed.

As always, the canonical source of API documentation is
`lib/notmuch.h`, or the doxygen formatted documentation in `notmuch(3)`

CLI
---

The `notmuch config set` subcommand gained a `--database` argument to
specify that the database should be updated, rather than a config file.

The speed of `notmuch new` and `notmuch reindex` in dealing with large
numbers of mail file deletions is significantly improved.

Emacs
-----

Completion related updates include: de-duplicating tags offered for
completion, use the actual initial input in address completion, allow
users to opt out of notmuch address completion, and do not force Ido
when prompting for senders.

Some keymaps used to contain bindings for unnamed commands.  These
lambda expressions have been replaced by named commands (symbols), to
ease customization.

Lexical binding is now used in all notmuch-emacs libraries.

Fix bug in calling `notmuch-mua-mail` with a non-nil RETURN-ACTION.

Removed, inlined or renamed functions and variables:
    `notmuch-address-locate-command`,
    `notmuch-documentation-first-line`, `notmuch-folder`,
    `notmuch-hello-trim', `notmuch-hello-versions` => `notmuch-version`,
    `notmuch-remove-if-not`, `notmuch-search-disjunctive-regexp`,
    `notmuch-sexp-eof`, `notmuch-split-content-type`, and
    `notmuch-tree-button-activate`.

  What's new in notmuch 0.31.2
  =========================

  Build
  -----

  Catch one more occurence of "version" in the build system, which
  caused the file to be regenerated in the release tarball.

  =========================

  Library
  -------

  Fix a memory initialization bug in notmuch_database_get_config_list.

  Build
  -----

  Rename file 'version' to 'version.txt'. The old file name conflicted
  with a C++ header for some compilers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  7 07:33:47 UTC 2020 - Dan Čermák <dcermak@suse.com>

- New upstream release 0.31

  * skip a failing test on ppc64

  What's new in notmuch 0.31
  =========================

  Emacs
  -----

  Notmuch now supports Emacs 27.1. You may need to set
  `mml-secure-openpgp-sign-with-sender` and/or
  `mml-secure-smime-sign-with-sender` to continue signing messages.

  The minimum supported major version of GNU Emacs is now 25.1.

  Add support for moving between threads after notmuch-tree-from-search-thread.

  New `notmuch-unthreaded` mode (added in Notmuch 0.30)

  Unthreaded view is a mode where each matching message is shown on a
  separate line.

  The main key entries to unthreaded view are

  'u' enter a query to view in unthreaded mode (works in hello,
  search, show and tree mode)

  'U' view the current query in unthreaded mode (works from search,
  show and tree)

  Saved searches can also specify that they should open in unthreaded
  view.

  Currently it is not possible to specify the sort order: it will
  always be newest first.

  Notmuch-Mutt
  ------------

  The shell pipeline executed by notmuch-mutt, which symlinked matched
  files to a maildir for mutt to access is replaced with internal perl
  processing. This search operation is now more portable, and somewhat
  faster.

  Library
  -------

  Improve exception handling in the library. This should
  largely eliminate terminations inside the library due to uncaught
  exceptions or internal errors.  No doubt there are a few uncovered
  code paths still; please report them as bugs.

  Add `notmuch_message_get_flag_st` and
  `notmuch_message_has_maildir_flag_st`, and deprecate the existing
  non-status providing versions.

  Move memory de-allocation from `notmuch_database_close` to
  `notmuch_database_destroy`.

  Handle relative filenames in `notmuch_database_index_file`, as
  promised in the documentation.

  Python Bindings
  ---------------

  Documentation for the python bindings is merged into the main
  sphinx-doc documentation tree. The merged documentation can be built
  with e.g. `make sphinx-html`

  Dependencies
  ------------

  We now support building notmuch against Xapian 1.5 (the current
  development version).

  Test Suite
  ----------

  Test suite fixes for compatibility with Emacs 27.1.

  Build System
  ------------

  Man pages are now compressed reproducibly.

- New upstream release 0.30

  S/MIME
  ------

  Handle S/MIME (PKCS#7) messages -- one-part signed messages, encrypted
  messages, and multilayer messages. Treat them symmetrically to
  OpenPGP messages. This includes handling protected headers
  gracefully.

  If you're using Notmuch with S/MIME, you currently need to configure
  gpgsm appropriately.

  Mixed-up MIME Repair
  --------------------

  Detect and automatically repair a common form of message mangling
  created by Microsoft Exchange (see index.repaired=mixedup in
  notmuch-properties(7)).

  Protected Headers
  -----------------

  Avoid indexing the legacy-display part of an encrypted message that
  has protected headers (see
  index.repaired=skip-protected-headers-legacy-display in
  notmuch-properties(7)).

  Python
  ------

  Drop support for python2, focus on python3.

  Introduce new CFFI-based python bindings in the python module named
  "notmuch2".  Officially deprecate (but still support) the older
  "notmuch" module.

  Dependencies
  ------------

  Support for Xapian 1.2 is removed. The minimum supported version of
  Xapian is now 1.4.0.
