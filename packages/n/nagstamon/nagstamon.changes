- update to 2.0:
  After a major overhaul Nagstamon is finally available in its 2.0 
  incarnation. Being formerly formed of Python 2 and GTK 2 it now comes
  freshly reshaped, made of Python 3 and Qt 5. 
  This technology shift caused the longer absence of any other stable 
  release, but was absolutely necessary to make sure there will be
  future releases too.

  These are some new features and fixes:
  + Based on Qt 5 it now comes with a better integrated look-and-feel
  + Partly simplified design
  + Less clutter in setting dialogs
  + Uses QT 5 multimedia which means native sound on Linux and MacOS
  + Uses only SVG graphics – allows changing colors even in systray icon
  + Customizable font and font size
  + Adjust to dark or light desktop theme
  + Action allowing to copy host/service information to clipboard
  + Added ‘Archive Event’ action for Check_MK monitors
  + Additionally supports IcingaWeb2
  + Updated Opsview and Centreon to support latest monitor server versions
  + Experimental support for Livestatus and Zenoss
  + No or less memory leaks, especially in Windows
  + Make sure only one instance per config is running
  + Millions of fixes
- adapted spec file to build again for Fedora and build with the latest
  changes of the 2.0 version (QT instead of GTK)
- builds only with Python 3 - so removing case decisions for old
  distributions that are no longer supported
