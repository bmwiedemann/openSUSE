- update to v5.1.2:
  * Rewrite internal testing tool verify and improve it to support testing
    suggestions.
  * Greatly improve the speed of suggestions in certain edge cases. See #45.
  * Fix minor encoding issue in the CLI tool on Windows when reading from
    file(s) instead of the standard input. UTF-8 is now the default encoding
    in that case and not the one of the console.

Sat Oct  8 05:20:22 UTC 2022 - Atri Bhattacharya <badshah400@gmail.com>

- Update to version 5.1.1:
  * Add configuration option BUILD_TOOLS that can be used to
    disable building the CLI tool (gh#nuspell/nuspell#122). 
  * Made error reporting more detailed and robust
    (gh#nuspell/nuspell#123).
  * Fix compiler warnings regarding usage of deprecated functions.
- Changes from version 5.1.0:
  * Add new API for finding dictionaries on the filesystem that
    uses facilities from C++17 std::filesystem.
  * Simplify CLI tool and removed some unused features from it.
  * Deprecate old API for finding dictionaries on the filesystem
    that used strings for paths.
  * Remove man-page for CLI tool and dependency on pandoc.
- BuildRequires: pkgconfig(catch2) < 3 instead of unversioned
  Catch2-devel, since package is not yet compatible with Catch2
  version 3 and higher.
- Require gcc-c++ >= 10 for successful builds, i.e. BuildRequires:
  gcc10-c++ for openSUSE < 1550.
- Fix building of API documentation and install it as part of
  new doc package; BuildRequires: fdupes, graphviz (for dot).
- Spec file cleanups:
  * Install license with every package.
  * Remove any doc files from shared lib and install as part of
    %{name}: shared lib should contain nothing more than the shared
    object(s) and license.
  * Move all %libname.so.* files to shared lib package, devel pkg
    should contain just the %libname.so symlink amidst other devel
    files.
  * %{name}-devel pkg dependencies: Add shared lib, drop %{name}.

- Update to version 5.0.0.
  * Fixed
    * Greatly reduce memory usage.
    * Increase speed of spellchecking.
    * Fix long lagging when generating suggestions in edge cases.
    * Fix building on OS Haiku.
  * Changed
    * Split file dictionary.hxx/cxx into multiple files. The other
      files are implementation details and the public header
      dictionary.hxx is now clean of private details.
  * Removed
    * Remove functions and classes that were deprecated in v4.x.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 12 21:07:52 UTC 2021 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 4.2.0.
  * Deprecate functions that allowed non-Unicode encoding. In 
    particular, Dictionary::imbue() and Dictionary::imbue_utf8().
  * Completely remove dependency on Boost. The CLI tools were 
    refactored to use ICU directly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 26 08:42:53 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 4.1.0.
  * Added: Add new API for finding dictionaries on the file-system. 
    It is a set of free functions located in the file finder.hxx.
  * Fixed: Improve searching for dictionaries on the file-system.
    Fix finding them on
    Fedora.
  * Deprecated: Deprecate the old API for finding dictionaries, 
    i.e. the class Finder in the file finder.hxx.
- Updates since 3.1.2.
  * Fix handling CRLF line endings in .dic. Fixes #89.
  * Fix CMake scripts for unusual install prefixes.
  * Improve hash-table insertion, avoid temporaries. This improves
    loading times.
  * Switch man-page generator from Ronn to Pandoc. This changes the
    dependencies for building. See the README.
  * Fix lifetime issue (segmentation fault) in ngram-based 
    suggestions.
  * Fix internal usage of std::codecvt in edge case in function 
    to_wide() and to_narrow()
  * Fix not propagating recursion depth in spell_break(), which 
    caused hangup.
  * Fix overwriting of PDB files when compiling with Visual Studio.
    This prevented debugging nuspell.dll.
  * Fix output of CLI tool to be more compatible to ispell and 
    hunspell.
  * Boost is no longer a dependency of the library at all. It is 
    still a dependency of the CLI tool. 
  * Use std::string_view in the public API instead of const 
    std::string&. Also use it internally at various places.
  * Build as shared library by default. Building as static is still 
    possible via the CMake's variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.
  * The public API is annotated with dll-export/visibility 
    attributes, and also some private functions are annotated needed 
    for testing. This reduces the file size. 
  * Use Unicode text segmentation by default in the CLI tool. 
    Simple segmentation on white-space is still available via CLI 
    option.
  * Delete deprecated functions in the class Finder.
  * Drop under-designed and undocumented feature in the CLI tool 
    about personal dictionaries.

Sat Jul 11 17:52:37 UTC 2020 - andy great <andythe_great@pm.me>

- Update to version 3.1.2.
  * Fixed: Internal refactorings that reduce function templates in
    utils and finder.
  * Changed: File utils.hxx is not installed any more. It is a 
    private header.
  * Deprecated: Some functions for searching dictionaries in class
    Finder are deprecated as they were searching in directories that
    no longer contain dictionaries.
