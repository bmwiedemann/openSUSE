    <comment>- Update to version 3.1.2.
  * Fixed: Internal refactorings that reduce function templates in
    utils and finder.
  * Changed: File utils.hxx is not installed any more. It is a 
    private header.
  * Deprecated: Some functions for searching dictionaries in class
    Finder are deprecated as they were searching in directories that
    no longer contain dictionaries.
- Fix build for Leap by enabling cmake rpath flag.

    <version>4.1.0</version>

    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to version 4.1.0.
  * Added: Add new API for finding dictionaries on the file-system. 
    It is a set of free functions located in the file finder.hxx.
  * Fixed: Improve searching for dictionaries on the file-system.
    Fix finding them on
    Fedora.
  * Deprecated: Deprecate the old API for finding dictionaries, 
    i.e. the class Finder in the file finder.hxx.
- Updates since 3.1.2.
  * Fix handling CRLF line endings in .dic. Fixes #89.
  * Fix CMake scripts for unusual install prefixes.
  * Improve hash-table insertion, avoid temporaries. This improves
    loading times.
  * Switch man-page generator from Ronn to Pandoc. This changes the
    dependencies for building. See the README.
  * Fix lifetime issue (segmentation fault) in ngram-based 
    suggestions.
  * Fix internal usage of std::codecvt in edge case in function 
    to_wide() and to_narrow()
  * Fix not propagating recursion depth in spell_break(), which 
    caused hangup.
  * Fix overwriting of PDB files when compiling with Visual Studio.
    This prevented debugging nuspell.dll.
  * Fix output of CLI tool to be more compatible to ispell and 
    hunspell.
  * Boost is no longer a dependency of the library at all. It is 
    still a dependency of the CLI tool. 
  * Use std::string_view in the public API instead of const 
    std::string&amp;. Also use it internally at various places.
  * Build as shared library by default. Building as static is still 
    possible via the CMake's variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.
  * The public API is annotated with dll-export/visibility 
    attributes, and also some private functions are annotated needed 
    for testing. This reduces the file size. 
  * Use Unicode text segmentation by default in the CLI tool. 
    Simple segmentation on white-space is still available via CLI 
    option.
  * Delete deprecated functions in the class Finder.
  * Drop under-designed and undocumented feature in the CLI tool 
    about personal dictionaries.

    <comment>- Update to version 4.2.0.
  * Deprecate functions that allowed non-Unicode encoding. In 
    particular, Dictionary::imbue() and Dictionary::imbue_utf8().
  * Completely remove dependency on Boost. The CLI tools were 
    refactored to use ICU directly.
