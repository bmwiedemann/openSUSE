- Update to version 1.2.1
  This is a bugfix release that fixes a crash in the GTK backend
  that is caused by GTK creating a dialog window on X11 even
  though the parent window is on Wayland, or vice versa. The
  build script also received a fix that improves usability when
  this library is set up as a dependency of another project.
  What's Changed
  * Build: Add alias target for dependent project CMake
    consumption
  * GTK: Open the dialog window on the same GdkScreen (and
    GdkDisplay) as the parent
  version 1.2.0:
  This release brings two new features: Opening a folder picker
  that allows multiple selection (PickFolderMultiple), and giving
  the dialog a parent window (only X11 support is currently
  implemented; Wayland support will likely be added in the
  future). A bunch of new functions have also been added to nfd.h
  in a backward compatible manner to support passing a parent
  window and allow for adding more new optional parameters in the
  future. There are also various code cleanups and improved code
  comments in Doxygen syntax.
  What's Changed
  * Test: Add tests with NFD_NATIVE
  * Replace Macros with Aliases
  * Doxygen Syntax
  * Add versioned API
  * New feature: Implement PickFolderMultiple
  * New feature: Accept native parent window handle and
    implement glue code to major platform abstraction frameworks
  * README: Add versioned API, PickFolderMultiple, and parent
    handle
  version 1.1.1:
  What's Changed
  * Build: Update minimum CMake version to 3.5
  version 1.1.0:
  This release brings support for setting a default folder for
  OpenDialog(), OpenDialogMultiple(), and PickFolder() in the
  Portal backend on a sufficiently new version of
  xdg-desktop-portal.
  This relies on flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal#1045, which has been
  merged and will be included in their next feature release. With
  older versions of xdg-desktop-portal, setting a default folder
  will have no effect, as is currently the case.
  In addition, the install target now generates and installs an
  nfd-config.cmake file, which makes for better CMake
  integration.
  What's Changed
  * Install CMake config script.
  * Portal: Support defaultPath for OpenDialog,
    OpenDialogMultiple, and PickFolder
  version 1.0.3:
  This release brings two improvements to the Portal
  implementation: better error messages, and a runtime check in
  NFD_PickFolder() for whether the installed xdg-desktop-portal
  service supports a folder picker.
  What's Changed
  * README: Remove untested portal warning and link OpenFile()
    current_folder PR
  * Portal: Support formatted error messages using sprintf()
  * Portal: Make PickFolder() check that portal interface
    version is >=3
  version 1.0.2:
  The Portal backend supports more older versions of glibc now.
  Code using NFDe that could previously build correctly should
  not encounter any behavioural changes.
  What's Changed
  * Build: Set target_include_directories correctly when NFDe is
    added as a subdirectory
  * ClangFormat: Force ClangFormat 13 for now
  * Build: Use XXX_LINK_LIBRARIES for linking to support *BSD
  * Portal: Add getrandom fallback for versions of GLIBC < 2.25
