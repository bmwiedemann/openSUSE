    and HOSTNAME manually to get reproducible builds
- add silence_post-build-checks.patch:
    silence checks by providing default switch targets in code

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 29 17:42:32 CET 2016 - manfred99@gmx.ch

- remove gsl2_support.patch
- add additional files to documentation
- Update to 4.5.5:
  * NCO supports the CDF5 file type first introduced by pnetCDF and now
    supported in Unidata netCDF as of version 4.4.0.
    Use '-5', '--5', '--fl_fmt=[cdf5|64bit_data|pnetcdf]'.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#cdf5
  * ncremap: -P option triggers filetype-specific workflow procedures
    (such as automatic permutation).
  * ncremap: -m map_fl supplies names to generated mapfiles and ncremap
    annotates map-files it creates with full history.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncremap
  * ncremap -j job_nbr option for MPI parallelism
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncremap
  * ncra/nces/ncwa: New operation tabs()=total_absolute_value.
    The the -y tabs option is like -y ttl except the sum is over
    absolute values. tabs(), mibs(), mebs(), and mabs() are analogous
    to ttl(), min(), mean(), and max().
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#op_typ
  * Improve support for Cygwin builds
  * Fix: ncremap: Inferred curvilinear grids always return points now in
    counterclockwise order.
  * Fix: ncremap: Inferring grids from curvilinear coordinates no longer
    confused by "branch cuts" (i.e., the date-line).
  * Fix: ncpdq: Fix problem that could cause '--gaa' option to fail in
    earlier versions.
  * Fix: nces: Copy attributes of coordinate variables in nces --nsm_grp.
  * Fix: ncra/nces: Correctly normalize "mebs" arithmetic.
  * Fix: ncap2: Fix incorrect handling of negative dimension indices.
  * Fix: ncatted/ncrename: Fully support --glb_att_add=--gaa.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#gaa
- Update to 4.5.4:
  * ncremap: A new netCDF operator for regridding.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncremap
  * ncks prints XML "_Unsigned" attribute for unsigned attribute types.
    Formerly, ncks did not preserve the signedness of attributes.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#xml
  * ncap2 now accepts [] and () syntax interchangeably.
    Expressions which formerly had to use one or the other can now
    use either.
  * ncap2 now conforms arrays by hyperslabbed dimension size rather
    than by dimension name.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#pdel
  * NCO now treats variables named wgt_* as weights and avoids
    performing math on them when possible.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#prc_xcp
  * ncap2 now accepts "sum" as a synonym for "total" in its methods.
    Additionally, ncap2 has a new function,
    ncap_stats_wvariance(var,wgt) to computed weighted standard
    deviations where missing values may be present.
    Additionally, ncap2 now builds with GSL 2.x. All thanks to Henry.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2
  * Fix: ncks -V in (at least) versions 4.5.1--4.5.3 could segfault.
  * Fix: After dimension reduction operations, ncra and ncwa excise the
    reduced dimensions from the CF "coordinates" attribute, if any.
    Versions 4.4.9--4.5.3 could, under certain circumstances involving
    multiple dimensions, retain extra whitespace in "coordinates".
- Update to 4.5.3:
  * NCO's new configure --disable-doc switch allows NCO (but not its
    documentation) to build on vanilla OSX again.
  * ncks --rgr nfr reads any/all grid information from input files,
    infers any necessary but missing information (e.g., estimates cell
    interface locations from cell midpoints), and outputs the gridfile
    in SCRIP-format for easy use by offline regridders.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grid
  * ncks --rgr skl='y' creates a "skeleton" version of a data file
    with the specified geometry.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#skl
  * Generate 2-D regional grids in SCRIP format, and, in conjunction
    with a mapfile, regrid to/from regional bounding boxes.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grid
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid
  * Use --xtn_var or --extensive to specify extensive variables.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid
  * Fix: ncks fixes two newly uncovered regridder bugs that were exposed by
    multi-level fields that contain missing values and underwent
    non-conservative (e.g., bilinear) regridding.
  * Fix: ncap2 now evaluates logical expressions with a method that does
    not convert the type of the arguments to lesser precision.
  * Fix: ncecat version 4.4.9 introduced a problem that could cause it
    to fail when using --gag mode on a single file.
  * Fix: ncatted version 4.5.1 introduced a bug that dumps core when
    attribute deletion is requested without a specific attribute name,
    i.e., whenever all attributes are to be deleted.
- Update to 4.5.2:
  * All operators can now add user-specified global attributes to
    output files using the --glb switch.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#glb
  * Grid generation: ncks generates SCRIP-format gridfiles for
    select grid types, in cluding uniform/equi-angular, cap/FV, and
    Gaussian. Options pertinent to the grid geometry and metadata are
    passed to NCO via key-value pairs prefixed by "--rgr".
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#grid
  * Regrid regional datasets with ESMF, SCRIP, and TempestRemap
    mapfiles. Please give it a try and send us feedback!
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid
  * Multi-file operators support a new extension to the -n option
    that understands calendar month counting.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#input
  * Fix: The ncra --wgt option, introduced in 4.4.9, works fine except,
    it turns out, for variables with missing values. The normalization
    for these values was incorrect and produced errors whose size was
    roughly inversely proportional to the size of the weights.
- Update to 4.5.1:
  * Regrid global datasets with TempestRemap mapfiles (in addition to
    ESMF and SCRIP, which were already supported).
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid
  * ncatted now supports regular expressions in both the variable name
    AND the attribute name (simultaneously, too). Previously, ncatted
    accepted regular expressions only in the variable name.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncatted
  * Add mibs/mabs/mebs methods and operators to ncap2. These are the
    absolute-value analogues of min/max/mean, so that, e.g., mibs()
    returns the minimum absolute-value of the operand.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#mibs
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ppc
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncap2
  * Prevent operators from repeating existing cell_methods attribute.
    Previously NCO would append new operations, e.g., "time: mean" to
    the existing cell_methods attribute, if any.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#cll_mth
  * Fix formatting of history_of_appended_files attribute when appended
    file had no history attribute.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#history
  * Fix: Round-up to one rather than round-down to zero in chunking maps lfp
    and rew. This fixes a bug that only appears on datasets with
    certain shapes.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#cnk
  * Fix bug using min/max on coordinate variables in ncap2
  * Fix: Initialize memory that appeared to cause zeros to be written
    by regridder compiled by clang on MacOSX.
- Update to 4.5.0:
  * Regrid global datasets with ESMF or SCRIP remap files.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#regrid
  * ncdismember is a one-stop shop for flattening and CF-checking.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncdismember
  * NCO introduces a convention to retain the history-attribute
    contents of all files that were appended to a file.
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#history
  * When copying the variables date_written or time_written to the
    output file, NCO now updates their contents the GMT time reported
    by the system-supplied gmtime().
    http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#cnv_acme
  * Fix ncatted so it preserves global attributes (including history)
    from the output file when in append (-A) mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  2 15:34:08 UTC 2015 - ocefpaf@gmail.com

- Updated to 4.4.7
    * Warn when appended output type differs from input type
    * Regression tests show no failures on gcc and clang Linux and MacOS
      One non-fatal failure on icc Linux (yellowstone) ncecat#9
      Output file is chunked differently than expected. Mysterious.
    * Initialize input chunksize defaults correctly for ncwa, ncecat, ncpdq
    * Replace strncpy() in sng_trm_trl_zro() with explicit loop to prevent valgrind complaining about,
      and Mac OS X crashing on, overlapping source and destination buffers
    * Support passing (int *)NULL to nc_inq_format_extended() stub
    * Fix GSL and UDUnits flags in Makefile (fixes yellowstone builds)
    * Use new NC_HAS_HDF4 to report HDF4 support with ncks -r
    * Document new chunking features
    * cnk_rew appears to work for rank = 3. Need larger datasets to be sure.
    * Tidy nco_bld_crd_aux()
    * Add regression test for non-coordinate dimension auxiliary coordinate variables
    * Almost finished implementing cnk_rew
    * cnk_min=0 sets minimum size of variables to chunk as twice blocksize
    * Using -X now imposes CNV_CCM_CCSM_CF=True regardless of Conventions attribute
    * Add regression for auxiliary coordinates
    * First regression-free version in three weeks
    * Now that nco_cnk_sz_set_trv() always called, allow it to work when ncecat creates new record dimension
    * Fix long-time bug where nco_cpy_var_dfn_trv() incorrectly sets dmn_cmn[].is_rec_var for record dimensions affected by
      --fix_rec_dmn or --mk_rec_dmn invocation (always set incorrectly except on first variable affected)
    * Adjust regression tests to work with --cnk_min. Document --cnk_min.
    * ncap_cst_mk() in ncap2_utl.cc checks that record dim is the first dim in list ONLY if nc3 file
      and nc4 file. This also allows users to define vars with multiple record dims.
    * Add hidden feature to defdim(): when dim_sz < 0 then dim is defined as unlimited
    * Replace NETCDF4_ROOT by NETCDF_ROOT in configure
    * Add --cnk_min to specify minimum size (default 8kB) in bytes of variable to chunk
    * Change configure.ac --enable-dap-netcdf to --enable-dap
    * Add cnk.cdl to test chunking algorithms
    * Add cnk_map=nco to assign to current NCO-recommended map
    * Always call chunking
    * Stubs for cnk_map = nc4 for default netCDF4 chunking (same as unchunking for now?)
    * Change links to online discussion forums from, e.g., https://sf.net/projects/nco/forums/forum/9830 to
      https://sf.net/p/nco/discussion/9830 to eliminate new circular reference errors from sf webserver
    * Rationalize regression tests with new chunking defaults (xst, xst)
    * Ensure user-specified full chunking paths take precedence over relative paths
    * Simplify nco_cnk_sz_set_trv()
    * Fix ncrename regression tests
    * Build in_4.nc from in.nc (not in.cdl due to ncgen chunksize problems and bugs) for regression tests
    * Add numerous regression tests to evaluate nc_rename_var/dim() behavior.
    * Avoid nc_rename_var/dim() bug in netCDF4 files by avoiding nc_redef()/nc_enddef(). No dice.
    * Improve hdr_pad, ncrename documentation
    * Add NCO_VERSION for consistency with NC_VERSION
    * Document newly discovered ncrename problems due to netCDF4 bugs http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#bug_nc4_rename
    * Check more error return codes in ncrename.c. Verifies NCO does not ignore any netCDF errors.
    * Add regression checks for valid values in renamed coordinates in netCDF4 files
    * Change to real Python convention where -1 is last element, e.g., -2 is penultimate element, -N is first element

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  1 22:43:12 UTC 2014 - ocefpaf@gmail.com

- Updated to 4.4.6
  * Add negative zero syntax to select last element of hyperslab.
  * Avoid void arithmetic in USE_NC4_SRD_WORKAROUND.
  * Change important nco_calloc() to nco_malloc() for speed.
  * Fix ncwa handling of packed variables for minimization/maximization.
  * Implement strncasecmp() for Windows and MSVC compilers.
  * Fix count bug in USE_NC4_SRD_WORKAROUND.
  * Implement USE_NC4_SRD_WORKAROUND by default in all applicable cases,
    i.e.,  for singly strided hyperslab access to netCDCF4 files.
  * Implement workaround to nc_get_vars() slowdown for netCDF4 in netCDF
    library Workaround avoids nc_get_vars() and instead loops through calls
    to nc_get_vara() Workaround implemented in nco_msa_get_var_trv() and
    activated, for now, by -D 6.
  * Finish ncrename rewrite. All capabilities work. No regressions.
    Some debugging, syntax, and documentation remains to be done.
  * Use netcdf_meta.h in nco.h to enable chunking/deflation calls for HDF4.
  * ncrename now builds and works again for all but attributes.
  * Print extended file format as _SOURCE_FORMAT with ncks --hdn.
  * Remove nco_dmn_usr_sng() and nco_obj_usr_sng() due to flawed algorithms.
  * Finish ncrename re-write for variables, groups, and dimensions.
    NCO versions 4.3.3-4.4.5 broke "." support and did not fully support
    groups.  Those versions renamed first and ignored subsequent instances
    of old_nm.  Now ncrename fails as intended when required objects are not
    present.  Attributes are more complex and are still broken.
  * Support netCDF 4.3.3 netcdf_meta.h in nco_netcdf.h so NC_HAVE_RENAME_GRP
    is found.
  * Add regression tests to make ncrename die when required entities not
    present.
  * Fix bug with ncra --dbl on packed variables with missing values.
  * Add debugging statements to track netCDF4 stride slowdown.
  * Note locations which assume record dimension is in first position.
  * Start to generalize ncra.c so single record dimensions can occupy any
    position.
  * Add regression test to demonstrate bug with ncra --dbl on
    packed float variables with missing values.
  * Implement missing getopt() line for file_format switch.
  * ./configure now checks for daperror() instead of nc__opendap().
  * Add NC_EIO error clarifications.
  * Create -V = --var_val = -Q --no_nm_prn for ncks to print only variable
    values.
  * Document -Q and -V and switch --quiet to -Q (not -q) and synonomize -q
    with --quench.
  * Clarify WARNING when record dimension size changes.
  * ncap2 command-line and script arguments can now both be specified AND
    executed.  Command-line args are executed before script:
    ncap2 -v -s "lon=longitude" -S in_4.nc out.nc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated to 4.4.5
  * New Features
  - NCO now supports stdin input file lists up to ~50 MB long.  This applies
    to all NCO multi-file operators (ncra, ncea, ncrcat).  The previous limit
    was 10 MB.  The new limit suffices for 30 years of hourly datasets where
    each dataset name is 192 bytes long.  One NASA user is averaging 10 years
    of data, or 87600 files.  Who will be the first user to break the million
    file barrier?
  - NCO now supports the CF ancillary_variables convention described at
    http://cfconventions.org/1.6.html#ancillary-data This convention allows
    ancillary variables to be associated with one or more primary variables.
    NCO attaches any such variables to the extraction list along with the
    primary variable and its coordinates and bounds, if any.
  - NCO now accesses DAP files on HTTPS servers. Previously NCO would only
    test filenames beginning with "http://" for DAP access.  Now NCO also
    tests filenames beginning with "https://" for DAP.  If you use DAP servers
    with a protocol besides HTTP or HTTPS please tell us so we can enable NCO
    for those services too.
  - ncks --grp_xtr_var_xcl: Group Extraction Variable Exclusion.  This new
    switch helps control variable and group extraction. Normally NCO works in
    "intersection mode" where the objects extracted are the intersection of
    arguments to -g and -v. And the --union switch can be used to make their
    union.  As of 4.4.4 (June, 2014), ncks (alone) supports an option to
    include specified groups yet exclude specified variables.  The
    --grp_xtr_var_xcl switch (with long option equivalent --gxvx extracts all
    contents of groups given as arguments to -g except for variables given as
    arguments to -v.  Use this when one or a few variables in hierarchical
    files are not to be extracted, and all other variables are.  This is
    useful when coercing netCDF4 files into netCDF3 files such as with
    converting, flattening, or dismembering files.
  - ncks --grp_xtr_var_xcl -g g1 -v v1 # Extract all of group g1 except v1
  - New chunking policy r1d changes chunksize of 1-D record variables (and no
    other variables) to specified (with --cnk_dmn) chunksize.  Any specified
    record dimension chunksizes will be applied to 1-D record variables only.
    Other dimensions may be chunked with their own --cnk_dmn options that will
    apply to all variables.  For example,
    ncks --cnk_plc=r1d --cnk_dmn=time,1000.  This sets time chunks to 1000
    only in 1-D record variables.  Without the r1d policy, time chunks would
    change in all variables.  Not to be confused with chunking map rd1.
    Thanks to James Adams for suggesting this.
