  <title>Suite of programs for manipulating NetCDF/HDF files</title>
  <description>The netCDF Operators, NCO, are a suite of command line programs known
as operators.  The operators facilitate manipulation and analysis of
self-describing data stored in the freely available netCDF and HDF
formats (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf and
http://www.hdfgroup.org, respectively).  Each NCO operator (e.g.,
ncks) takes netCDF or HDF input file(s), performs an operation (e.g.,
averaging, hyperslabbing, or renaming), and outputs a processed netCDF
file.  Although most users of netCDF and HDF data are involved in
scientific research, these data formats, and thus NCO, are generic and
are equally useful in fields from agriculture to zoology.  The NCO
User's Guide illustrates NCO use with examples from the field of
climate modeling and analysis.  The NCO homepage is
http://nco.sourceforge.net/.
