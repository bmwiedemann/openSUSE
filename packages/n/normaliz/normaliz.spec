%description
Normaliz is a tool for computations in affine monoids, vector configurations,
lattice polytopes, and rational cones. It supports,

* convex hulls and dual cones
* conversion from generators to constraints and vice versa
* triangulations, disjoint decompositions and Stanley decompositions
* Hilbert basis of rational, not necessarily pointed cones
* normalization of affine monoids
* lattice points of rational polytopes and (unbounded) polyhedra
* Hilbert (or Ehrhart) series and (quasi) polynomials under
  Z-gradings (for example, for rational polytopes)
* generalized (or weighted) Ehrhart series and Lebesgue integrals of
  polynomials over rational polytopes via NmzIntegrate
