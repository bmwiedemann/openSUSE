  <title>Tray icon for launching NVIDIA Settings</title>
  <description>Little NVIDIA tray icon.
Hover over it and it will tell you your GPU temperature if your card is into that kind of thing.
A double click will launch the NVIDIA settings control panel, and right click will bring up a nifty menu with a few options.
Also on the menu it will show the NVIDIA driver version, which is surely to come in handy at least one time in your life.</description>
