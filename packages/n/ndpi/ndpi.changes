Thu Jan  2 11:50:52 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Add hyperscan-devel as dependency to libndpi-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 25 10:13:32 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Drop not longer needed patches (fixed upstream)
  * ndpi-fix-build.patch
  * reproducible.patch
- Update to version 3.0
  New Features
  * nDPI now reports the protocol ASAP even when specific fields
    have not yet been dissected because such packets have not yet
    been observed. This is important for inline applications that
    can immediately act on traffic. Applications that need full
    dissection need to call the new API function
    ndpi_extra_dissection_possible() to check if metadata dissection
    has been completely performed or if there is more to read before
    declaring it completed.
  * TLS (formerly identified as SSL in nDPI v2.x) is now dissected
    more deeply, certificate validity is extracted as well
    certificate SHA-1.
  * nDPIreader can now export data in CSV format with option -C
  * Implemented Sequence of Packet Length and Time (SPLT) and Byte
    Distribution (BD) as specified by Cisco Joy
    (https://github.com/cisco/joy). This allows malware activities
    on encrypted TLS streams.
  * Available as library and in ndpiReader with option -J
  * Promoted usage of protocol categories rather than protocol
    identifiers in order to classify protocols. This allows
    application protocols to be clustered in families and thus better
    managed by users/developers rather than using hundred of
    protocols unknown to most of the people.
  * Added Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) calculation used to detect
    protocol misbehaviour (e.g. slow-DoS detection)
  * Added data analysis features for computign metrics such as
    entropy, average, stddev, variance on a single and consistent
    place that will prevent when possible. This should ease traffic
    analysis on monitoring/security applications. New API calls have
    been implemented such as ndpi_data_XXX() to handle these
    calculations.
  * Initial release of Python bindings available under nDPI/python.
  * Implemented search of human readable strings for promoting data
    exfiltration detection
  * Available as library and in ndpiReader with option -e
  * Fingerprints
    JA3 (https://github.com/salesforce/ja3)
    HASSH (https://github.com/salesforce/hassh)
    DHCP
