%description -n libndpi%{sover}
nDPI is a ntop-maintained superset of the OpenDPI library. It extends
the original library by adding new protocols that are otherwise

be more suitable for traffic monitoring applications, by disabling
specific features that slow down the DPI engine while being them
un-necessary for network traffic monitoring.
