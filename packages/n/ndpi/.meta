  <title>Extensible deep packet inspection library</title>
  <description>nDPI is a ntop-maintained superset of the popular OpenDPI library. Released
under the LGPL license, its goal is to extend the original library by adding
new protocols that are otherwise available only on the paid version of OpenDPI.
In addition to Unix platforms, we also support Windows, in order to provide
you a cross-platform DPI experience. Furthermore, we have modified nDPI do be
more suitable for traffic monitoring applications, by disabling specific
features that slow down the DPI engine while being them un-necessary for
network traffic monitoring.
