Sun Nov 10 19:26:09 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.9.0
  * TLS 1.3 is supported for Mbed TLS.
  * WolfSSL is now supported without an extra module. (You need to
    honor the licensing terms of WolfSSL itself however.)
  * TLS support for PSK (pre-shared keys).
  * A new nng_id_visit API is available for iterating over all
    nodes in an ID hash map.
  * An experimental (undocumented) but exposed "public" API for

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 24 06:38:59 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.8.0
  New Features
  * A new logging framework should help with debugging.
    This framework allows applications to provide their own loggers.
    Initially we have added logging for SP connection related
    events, but more can be added later.
    See nng_log(3), nng_log_set_logger(3) for details.
  * In support of the above, nng_str_sockaddr(3) is added.
    This function obtains a representation of the socket address
    suitable for display (or logging).
  Bugs Fixed
  * A memory leak associated with a connection lock object for TLS
    connections is fixed.
  * This only affects platforms where mutexes are allocated
    dynamically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 09:59:52 UTC 2024 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.7.3
  * Improved Mbed TLS configuration.
  * New NNG_ENABLE_IPV6 option to disable IPv6.
  * Fix for test failures when system does not support IPv6.
  * Compiler warning fixes.
  * Fix for various documentation formatting bugs.
- Update to version 1.7.2
  * New NNG_ENABLE_COMPAT (defaults to ON) can be disabled to
    remove compatibility support for legacy libnanomsg.
  * Better detection and handling of Mbed TLS - especially
    version 3.0 and later.
  * Fixed some compilation warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 28 17:17:49 UTC 2024 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 1.7.1:
  * This fixes two problems and includes a new example program.
- update to 1.7.0:
  * A new compile time setting, `NNG_MAX_POLLER_THREADS` is
    introduced, with a default value of 8, and will limit the
    number of threads
  * A new supplemental API, nng_id_map(3), is made available.
    This exposes the internal ID hash API NNG uses mapping
    integer IDs
  * (like socket IDs) to data structures. It also brings back
    support for 64-bit IDs. See bug #1740.
  * A new transport (experimental), for `socket://` is available.
    This allows a connection using sockets created with
    `socketpair()` (or the new `nng_socket_pair()` supplemental
    API), which can help use cases where file descriptors are
    passed between processes or inherited via `fork()`.  This API
    is only available on Linux.  It does have somewhat different
    semantics for establishing the connection, so please see the
    manual page for `nng_socket(5)` for more information.
  * WebSocket close is fixed to conform to RFC 6455, sending the
    close frame, and waiting to receive the close frame from the
    peer.  This allows websocket based connections to ensure that
    data messages are fully delivered before shutting down. See
    bugs #1733, #1734 and #1735. Thanks @alawn-wang for the
    inspiration and a first draft of the change.
  * The REQ and SURVEYOR protocols were fixed to improve
    scalability when many clients or many contexts are used.  As
    part of this change, a new option, `NNG_OPT_REQ_RESENDTICK`
    is available to adjust how often we check for expired
    requests.  See bug #1663.
  * A new ability to override compile-time settings for thread
    counts is available.  This facility is considered
    experimental, and is not documented in manual pages -- and is
    subject to change without notice. Please see
    nng_init_set_parameter() in the nng.h header file.  The
    values that can be tuned are listed there along with comments
    describing their use.  See bug #1572.
  * As part of the fixes for #1572, tunable values for setting
    fixed values (rather upper limits) for thread counts are now
    exposed properly via CMake variables. These are
    `NNG_NUM_EXPIRE_THREADS` and `NNG_NUM_TASKQ_THREADS`.
  * A new API, `nng_aio_set_expire()` is introduced as a
    complement to `nng_aio_set_timeout()`.  This provides
    absolute expiration times, which may be easier in
    circumstances involving multiple actions such as common
    state-machine based idioms.
  * A bug which caused TLS connections to spin on accept, causing
    high CPU usage, is fixed.  See bug #1673.
  * The separate thread created for the timer is removed.  See
    bug #1729.
  * Various minor documentation fixes were made, some contributed
    by Patrik Wenger .

- update to 1.6.0:
  * Numerous critical bugs were fixed; some of these led to seg
    faults, crashes, and memory leaks.  See bugs #1523, #1713,
    #1702, #1657, #1347, #1518, #1526, #1541, #1638, #1543, #1657,
    #1658
  * Significant performance optimizations have been mad
  * New APIs were added for `nng_aio_busy()`,
    `nng_ctx_sendmsg()`, `nng_ctx_recvmsg()`, `nng_device_aio()`.
  * A CMake tunable for limiting the number of threads use for
    request expiration is provided via the `NNG_MAX_EXPIRE_THREADS`
    option.
  * Additionally various fixes for compilation problems,
    documentation errata, test case, and so forth have been applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 23 14:10:18 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.5.2
  * MbedTLS 3.0 is now supported.
  * Several bugs in the aio subsystem leading to hangs or
    performance issues are addressed.
  * Possible crash due to mismatched nni_strdup/free usage fixed.
  * Incorrect version number macros in CMake configuration fixed.
  * Several other minor cleanups (remove dead code, simplify some
    things)
- Update to version 1.5.1
  * This release just addresses problems with the version label
    and cmake version properties.
- Update to version 1.5.0
  * This release provides a two new convenience APIs,
    nng_msg_reserve() and nng_msg_capacity(), which can help with
    avoiding preallocations.
  * Additionally this release fixes a bug introduced in v1.4.0
    where setting IPC socket permissions on Linux did not work.
- Update to version 1.4.0
  * This is principally a performance release, as we have
    introduced a bunch of new features that should improve
    performance, especially for higher end systems (those with
    multiple cores will see substantially improved scalability, and
    lower latencies
  Other features:
  * TCP ports may now be specified as service names.
  * wss4, wss6, ws4, and ws6 can be used to force IPv6 or IPv4
    binding for websocket URLs.
  * REQ will fail fast if no retry timer is present, and the peer
    disconnects.
  * abstract sockets can be used on Linux (see nng_ipc.7 for
    details).
  * websocket stream mode now supports TEXT mode streams.
  * thread names can be set, and NNG will set names for its own
    (see nng_thr_setname.3).
  * IPv6 scoped addresses are supported.
  * nngcat grew --file and --data options to supply data to send.
- Update to version 1.3.2
  * This release is just a set of improvements to fix some
    documentation bug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  1 13:29:27 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.3.1
  Fixes
  * WebSocket and HTTP support for IPv6 addresses (note: IPv6
    scopes are still not supported).
  * Serious framing error in TLS (regression introduced in 1.3.0).
  * nng_msg_clear was clearing the header; now it only clears the
    body.
  * Use-after-free segfault in rep protocol.
  * NNG_OPT_RECONNMAXT zero did not prevent exponential backoff.
  * Use-after-free in TLS.
  * Hangs in nng_close fixed.
  * Fixes to ease inclusion in other projects.
  * Numerous minor doc bugs fixed.
  * Various test suite bugs fixed.
  Features
  * nngcat now supports data from standard input when the file is
    specified as "-".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  2 21:38:39 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.3.0
  Features
  * Support for TLS 1.3 and external TLS providers.
  * Message cloning and related performance improvements.
  * Numerous other performance improvements.
  * HTTP Server support for "non-exclusive" registration -- a given
    handler may be registered as a fallback handler (e.g. for a
    directory), even if more specific handlers are registered.
  * Performance test programs grew more options to select different
    protocols and to change the URL to test across different
    transports.
  Notable Bug Fixes
  * Thread count is limited.
  * Previously we would spawn potentially vast numbers of threads
    based on the number of available cores.
  * Raw mode fixes for XREQ and XRESPONDENT.
  * HTTP Server root URL handling had a few issues which are
    resolved.
  * Numerous test suites uncovered small (rare) races, etc.
  * REP protocol with SENDFD was inconsistent
  Other Changes
  * Polyamorous Pair v1 mode is changed, such that a new API call is
    needed to use it. Further, this mode will likely be removed in a
    future release.
  * Maximum hop count across nng_device() proxies is now limited
    to 15.
  * The nng_msg_options support was removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  6 21:31:19 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.6
  * This is another release to fix builds for older compiles
    without support for C11 atomics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 29 20:36:26 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.5
  * This release fixes a mistake that prevented the code from
    building for people on older compilers or older operating
    systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 14 11:16:17 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.4
  fixed:
  * #1132 Masking error in LMQ leads to corruption
  * #1131 (openindiana) compile error
  * fix reported versions in nng.h and CMakeLists.txt
  The critical bug here is #1132 which leads to use after free
  heap corruption, and unpredictable results once the receive or
  send queue wraps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan  5 19:36:17 UTC 2020 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.3
  fixed:
  * #1079 Use after free in tcp dialer
  * #1075 WebSocket use after free
  * #1064 Potential deadlock in statistics code
  * #1065 resolver leaks work structures

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 22 15:03:19 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2
  This is a minor feature release of NNG.
  * Notably it includes support for non-SP protocol usages
    + for example NNG can be used to make generic websocket or HTTP
      applications now.
  * The default maximum receive size is lifted. (If you use NNG on
    an untrusted network, please set an explicit limit instead of
    relying on the defaults!)
  * Substantial work on performance. Most protocols should see
    a nice boost.
  * Numerous bugs fixed.

- Update to version 1.1.1
  This fixes a few problems with 1.1.0.
  * The version number at build time was misreported as 1.0.1.
    It will now be 1.1.1.
  * Support for use in CMake scenarios involving add_subdirectory
  * Fix for the bug report URL if NNG crashes
  * Fix for a crash if a remote websocket peer sends PING requests

- Update to version 1.1.0
  There are numerous bug fixes and improvements in this since 1.0.1.
  * DNS resolution is done asynchronously at dial time, leading to
    better self healing in the face of changing DNS records (and
    the possibility to use DNS for round-robin load balancing.)
  * Better peer identification is possible with IPC based transports.
  * The HTTP framework has better support for cancellation, and the
    HTTP client has a much friendlier ability to execute transactions.
    Additionally, the HTTP client can now support servers that insist
    on sending chunked transfer encodings.
  * The ZeroTier transport received a lot of work, so that it is far
    more stable, and supports more properties relating to peer
    identification. There are (undocumented) options to tune the
    local IP addresses used in ZeroTier as well. Also, the entire
    configuration process for ZeroTier is much saner.
  * A statistics API is available to obtain statistics about the
    application. Unfortunately, only a few statistics have been added
    -- more will be added in coming releases.
  * More modern CMake style is used to provide much more correct use
    from CMake projects - it should no longer be necessary to call
    find_package(Threads) or similar.
