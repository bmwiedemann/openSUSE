Thu Dec 22 08:33:27 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.16.01:
  * Fix the creation of the table of contents in the HTML version
    of the documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 08:27:34 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 2.16:
  * Support for the rdf format has been discontinued and all the
    RDOFF utilities has been removed.
  * The --reproducible option now leaves the filename field in the
    COFF object format blank. This was always rather useless since it is
    only 18 characters long; as such debug formats have to carry their own
    filename information anyway.
  * Fix handling of MASM-syntax reserved memory (e.g. dw ?) when
    used in structure definitions.
  * The preprocessor now supports functions, which can be less verbose
    and more convenient than the equivalent code implemented using
    directives. See ppfunc.
  * Fix the handling of %00 in the preprocessor.
  * Fix incorrect handling of path names affecting error messages,
    dependency generation, and debug format output.
  * Support for the RDOFF output format and the RDOFF tools have been
    removed. The RDOFF tools had already been broken since at least NASM
    2.14. For flat code the ELF output format recommended; for segmented
    code the obj (OMF) output format.
  * New facility: preprocessor functions. Preprocessor functions, which
    are expanded similarly to single-line macros, can greatly simplify
    code that in the past would have required a lengthy list of directives
    and intermediate macros. See ppfunc.
  * Single-line macros can now declare parameters (using a &&
    prefix) that creates a quoted string, but does not requote an
    already quoted string. See define.
  * Instruction table updated per public information available as of
    November 2022.
  * All warnings in the preprocessor have now been assigned warning
    classes. See warnings.
  * Fix the invalid use of RELA-type relocations instead of
    REL-type relocations when generating DWARF debug information for
    the elf32 output format.
  * Fix the handling at in istruc when the structure contains
    local labels. See istruc.
  * When assembling with --reproducible, don't encode the filename
    in the COFF header for the coff}, win32 or win64 output
    formats. The COFF header only has space for an 18-character filename,
    which makes this field rather useless in the first place. Debug output
    data, if enabled, is not affected.
  * Fix incorrect size calculation when using MASM syntax for non-byte
    reservations (e.g. dw ?.)
  * Allow forcing an instruction in 64-bit mode to have a (possibly
    redundant) REX prefix, using the syntax rex as a prefix.
  * Add a vex prefix to enforce VEX (AVX) encoding of an
    instruction, either using the 2- or 3-byte VEX prefixes.
  * The CPU directive has been augmented to allow control of
    generation of VEX (AVX) versus EVEX (AVX-512) instruction formats, see
    CPU.
  * Some recent instructions that previously have been only available
    using EVEX encodings are now also encodable using VEX (AVX)
    encodings. For backwards compatibility these encodings are not enabled
    by default, but can be generated either via an explicit vex
    prefix or by specifying either CPU LATEVEX or CPU NOEVEX; see
    CPU.
  * Document the already existing unimacro directive. See unmacro.
  * Fix a code range generation bug in the DWARF debug format
    (incorrect information in the DW_AT_high_pc field) for the ELF
    output formats. This bug happened to cancel out with a bug in older
    versions of the GNU binutils linker, but breaks with other linkers and
    updated or other linkers that expect the spec to be followed.
  * Fix segment symbols with addends, e.g. jmp _TEXT+10h:0 in
    output formats that support segment relocations, e.g. the obj
    format.
  * Fix various crashes and hangs on invalid input

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 12:36:14 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- add reproducible.patch to avoid use of __DATE__

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 14:02:04 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 2.15.05:
  + Fix {%ifid $} and {%ifid $$} incorrectly being treated as true.
  + Add {--reproducible} option to suppress NASM version numbers
    and timestamps in output files. See {opt-reproducible}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 20:20:20 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 2.15.4:
  * More sensible handling of the case where one single-line macro
  definition will shadow another.
  * Add special preprocessor tokens \c{%*?} and \c{%*??} that expand
  like \c{%?} and \c{%??} in single-line macros only. See
  \k{selfref%*?}.
  * Fix SSE instructions not being recognized with an explicit memory
  operation size (e.g. \c{movsd qword [eax],xmm0}).
  * The \c{-L+} option no longer enables \c{-Lw}, which is mainly
  useful to debug NASM crashes. See \k{opt-L}.
  * The NASM-only RDOFF output format backend, which has been broken
  since at least NASM 2.14, has been disabled. The RDOFF tools are
  scheduled to be removed from the NASM distribution in NASM 2.16. If
  you have a concrete use case for RDOFF, please file a NASM bug report
  at \W{https://bugs.nasm.us/}\c{https://bugs.nasm.us/} as soon as
  possible. See \k{rdffmt}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul 18 09:22:33 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- nasm 2.15.3:
  * Add instructions from the Intel Instruction Set Extensions and
    Future Features Programming Reference, June 2020. This includes
    AVX5512 bfloat16, AVX512 mask intersect, and Intel Advanced
    Matrix Extensions (AMX).
  * Support for bfloat16 floating-point constants
  * various bug fixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jul  4 16:22:43 UTC 2020 - Andreas Stieger <andreas.stieger@gmx.de>

- update to 2.15.2:
  * Fix the handling of macro parameter ranges (%{:}), including
    with brace-enclosed original arguments
- includes changes from 2.15.01:
  * Add instructions for Intel Control Flow Enforcement Technology
- includes changes from 2.15:
  * The comparison and booleanizing operators can now be used in
    any expression context, not just %if
  * New operator ? ... :. 
  * Signed shift operators <<< and >>>
  * The MASM DUP syntax for data definitions is now supported,
    in a somewhat enhanced form
  * Warn for strange legacy behavior regarding empty arguments in
    multi-line macro expansion, but try to match legacy behavior in
    most cases. Legacy behavior can be disabled with the directive
    %pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion
  * A much more sensible limit to expression evaluation depth.
    The previously defined limit would rarely trigger before NASM
    died with a stack overrun error on most systems
  * The state of warnings can now be saved and restored via the
    [WARNING PUSH] and [WARNING POP] directives
  * The sectalign on|off switch does not affect an explicit directive
  * Fixed 'mismatch in operand sizes' error in the MOVDDUP,
    CMPXCHG8B and CMPXCHG16B instructions.
  * Removed obsolete gnu-elf-extensions warning about 8- and 16-bit
    relocation generation
  * Added group aliases for all prefixed warnings
  * Added implicitly sized versions of the K... instructions,
    which allows the K... instructions to be specified without a
    size suffix as long as the operands are sized
  * Added -L option for additional listing information
  * Added some warnings for obsolete instructions for a specified CPU.
  * Deprecated -hf and -y options. Use -h instead
  * Made DWARF as the default debug format for ELF
  * Added %pragma list options... to set or clear listing options
  * Allowed immediate syntax for LEA instruction (ignore operand
    size completely)
  * Added limited functionality MASM compatibility package
  * Add single-line macros aliases using %defalias or %idefalias.
    These behave like a kind of "symbolic links" for single-line
    macros
  * Added support for stringify, nostrip, evaluating, and greedy
    single-line macro arguments
  * Unused single-line macro arguments no longer need to have a
    specified name
  * Added conditional comma operator %,
  * Changed private namespace from __foo__ to __?foo?__, so a user
    namespace starting from underscore is now clean from symbols.
    For backwards compatibility, the previous names are defined as
    aliases
  * Added support of ELF weak symbols and external references
  * Changed the behavior of the EXTERN keyword and introduced
    REQUIRED keyword
  * Added %ifusable and %ifusing directives
  * Made various performance improvements and stability fixes in
    macro preprocessor engine
  * Improved NASM error handling and cleaned up error messages
- includes changes from 2.14.03:
  * Suppress nuisance "label changed during code generation"
    messages after a real error
  * Add support for the merge and strings attributes on ELF sections
  * Add support for the note, preinit_array, init_array, and
    fini_array sections type in ELF
  * Handle more than 32,633 sections in ELF

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  5 15:11:25 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 2.14.02:
  * Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation pass if a list file is specified.
  * Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
  * If debugging is enabled, define a __DEBUG_FORMAT__ predefined macro. See section 4.11.7.
  * Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
  * Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
  * Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
  * Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
  * Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
  * Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
  * Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
  * Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator unconditionally.
  * Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
  * Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
  * Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
  * Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
  * Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
  * Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
  * Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
  * Fixed subsections_via_symbols for macho object format.
  * Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
  * Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the command line. See section 6.9.
  * Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
  * Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive. See section 2.1.29.
  * Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement before input. See section 2.1.30.
  * Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New Instruction) instructions.
  * Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed using global-symbol rules. See section 6.8.
  * Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
  * The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of the symbol.
  * Support private_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL directive. See section 7.8.5.
  * Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
  * Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See section 2.1.31.
  * Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
  * Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See section 2.1.32.
  * Added the --include command line option, an alias to -P (section 2.1.18).
  * Added the --help command line option as an alias to -h (section 3.1).
  * Added -W, -D, and -Q suffix aliases for RET instructions so the operand sizes of these instructions can be encoded without using o16, o32 or o64.

    versions would produce invalid symbols and relocations on a 
    regular basis.
  * Support for thread-local storage in Mach-O.
  * Support for arbitrary sections in Mach-O.
  * Fix wrong negative size treated as a big positive value passed 
    into backend causing NASM to crash.
  * Fix handling of zero-extending unsigned relocations, we have 
    been printing wrong message and forgot to assign segment with 
    predefined value before passing it into output format.
  * Fix potential write of oversized (with size greater than 
    allowed in output format) relative relocations.
  * Portability fixes for building NASM with LLVM compiler.
  * Add support of Codeview version 8 (cv8) debug format for win32 
    and win64 formats in the COFF backend, see section 7.5.3.
  * Allow 64-bit outputs in 16/32-bit only backends. Unsigned 
    64-bit relocations are zero-extended from 32-bits with a 
    warning (suppressible via -w-zext-reloc); signed 64-bit 
    relocations are an arror.

Tue Jun 16 17:13:54 CET 2011 - per@computer.org

upgrade to 2.09.08. Lots of changes & fixes since version 2.07:

C.1.1 Version 2.09.08

    * Fix __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ assignment when output driver alias is used. For example when -f elf
      is used __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ must be set to elf, if -f elf32 is used __OUTPUT_FORMAT__ must be
      assigned accordingly, i.e. to elf32. The rule applies to all output driver aliases. See 
      section 4.11.6. 

C.1.2 Version 2.09.07

    * Fix attempts to close same file several times when -a option is used.
    * Fixes for VEXTRACTF128, VMASKMOVPS encoding. 

C.1.3 Version 2.09.06

    * Fix missed section attribute initialization in bin output target. 

C.1.4 Version 2.09.05

    * Fix arguments encoding for VPEXTRW instruction.
    * Remove invalid form of VPEXTRW instruction.
    * Add VLDDQU as alias for VLDQQU to match specification. 

C.1.5 Version 2.09.04

    * Fix incorrect labels offset for VEX intructions.
    * Eliminate bogus warning on implicit operand size override.
    * %if term could not handle 64 bit numbers.
    * The COFF backend was limiting relocations number to 16 bits even if in real there were a way
      more relocations. 

C.1.6 Version 2.09.03

    * Print %macro name inside %rep blocks on error.
    * Fix preprocessor expansion behaviour. It happened sometime too early and sometime simply
      wrong. Move behaviour back to the origins (down to NASM 2.05.01).
    * Fix unitialized data dereference on OMF output format.
    * Issue warning on unterminated %{ construct.
    * Fix for documentation typo. 

C.1.7 Version 2.09.02

    * Fix reversed tokens when %deftok produces more than one output token.
    * Fix segmentation fault on disassembling some VEX instructions.
    * Missing %endif did not always cause error.
    * Fix typo in documentation.
    * Compound context local preprocessor single line macro identifiers were not expanded
      early enough and as result lead to unresolved symbols. 

C.1.8 Version 2.09.01

    * Fix NULL dereference on missed %deftok second parameter.
