- Update to version 1.6.0
  Added
  * Support draft versions of NTPv5 with configuration changes.

  * Per source configuration of poll intervals.
  * Allow setting a custom reference id for stratum 1 servers.
  Changed

    receive timestamp instead of being zero.
  * Support of rustls 0.21 and 0.22 is removed.
  * Certificate validation is now done through
