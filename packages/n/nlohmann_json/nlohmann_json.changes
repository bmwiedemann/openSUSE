- Update to version 3.7.0
  New Features
  * Add overload of the contains function to check if a JSON
    pointeris valid without throwing exceptions, just like its
    counterpart for object keys.
  * Add a function to_string to allow for generic conversion to
    strings.
  * Add return value for the emplace_back function, returning a
    reference to the added element just like C++17 is introducing
    this for std::vector.
  Bug Fixes
  * Fix an issue where typedefs with certain names yielded a
    compilation error.
  * Fix a conversion to std::string_view in the unit tests.
  * Fix get_to method to clear existing content before writing.
  Improvements
  * Switch from Catch to doctest for the unit tests which speeds
    up compilation and runtime of the 112,112,308 tests.
  * Add an explicit section to the README about the frequently
    addressed topics character encoding, comments in JSON, and the
    order of object keys.
  * Use GNUInstallDirs to set library install directories.
- Use previously introduced testsuite timeout only on Tumbleweed
  or newer since the way the timeout parameter is passed to the
  %ctest macro does not work on older distributions.

Sun Mar 24 22:25:54 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Lower required cmake version
- Update to version 3.6.1
  New Features
  * Overworked the public interface for JSON Pointers. The creation
    of JSON Pointers is simplified with operator/ and operator/=.
    JSON Pointers can be inspected with empty, back, and
    parent_pointer, and manipulated with push_back and pop_back.
  * Added a boolean method contains to check whether an element
    exists in a JSON object with a given key. Returns false when
    acalled on non-object types.
  Improvements
  * The performance of dumping integers has been greatly improved.
  * Added CMake parameter JSON_Install to control whether the
    library should be installed (default: on).
  * Fixed a lot of compiler and linter warnings.
  * Reduced required CMake version from 3.8 to 3.1.
  * Added nodiscard attribute to meta(), array(), object(),
    from_cbor, from_msgpack, from_ubjson, from_bson, and parse.

- Update to version 3.5.0
  This release introduces the support for structured bindings and
  reading from FILE*. Besides, a few bugs have been fixed.
  All changes are backward-compatible.

- Update to version 3.4.0
  This release introduces three new features:
  * BSON (Binary JSON) is next to CBOR, MessagePack, and UBJSON the
    fourth binary (de)serialization format supported by the library.
  * Adjustable error handlers for invalid Unicode allows to specify
    the behavior when invalid byte sequences are serialized.
  * Simplified enum/JSON mapping with a macro in case the default
    mapping to integers is not desired.
  Furthermore, some effort has been invested in improving the parse
  error messages. Besides, a few bugs have been fixed.
  All changes are backward-compatible.

- Update to version 3.3.0
  This release adds support for GCC 4.8. Furthermore, it adds a
  function get_to to write a JSON value to a passed reference.
  Another topic of this release was the CMake support which has
  been overworked and documented.
  Besides, a lot of bugs have been fixed and slight improvements
  have been made. All changes are backward-compatible.

- Update to version 3.2.0
  This release introduces a SAX interface to the library. While
  this may be a very special feature used by only few people, it
  allowed to unify all functions that consumed input and created
  some kind of JSON value. Internally, now all existing functions
  like parse, accept, from_cbor, from_msgpack, and from_ubjson use
  the SAX interface with different event processors. This allowed
  to separate the input processing from the value generation.
  Furthermore, throwing an exception in case of a parse error is
  now optional and up to the event processor. Finally, the JSON
  parser is now non-recursive (meaning it does not use the call
  stack, but std::vector<bool> to track the hierarchy of structured
  values) which allows to process nested input more efficiently.
  Furthermore, the library finally is able to parse from wide string
  types. This is the first step toward opening the library from
  UTF-8 to UTF-16 and UTF-32.
  This release further fixes several bugs in the library.
  All changes are backward-compatible.

- Drop patches:
  * nlohmann_json-cmake-lib_suffix.patch (not longer needed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 10 09:08:51 UTC 2018 - mardnh@gmx.de

- Update to version 3.1.2
  Bug Fixes
  * Fixed a memory leak occurring in the parser callback (#1001).
  * Different specializations of basic_json (e.g., using different template
    arguments for strings or objects) can now be used in assignments (#972, #
    977, #986).
  * Fixed a logical error in an iterator range check (#992).
  
  Improvements
  * The parser and the serialization now support user-defined string types (#
    1006, #1009).
  
  Further Changes
  * Clang Analyzer is now used as additional static analyzer; see make
    clang_analyze.
  * Overworked README by adding links to the documentation (#981).
  
  Deprecated functions
  
  This release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following
  functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the
  next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):
  
  * Function iterator_wrapper are deprecated. Please use the member function
    items() instead.
  * Functions friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&) and
    friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&) are
    deprecated. Please use friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream&,
    basic_json&) and friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&)
    instead.

- Update to version 3.1.1
  Bug Fixes
  * Fixed parsing of CBOR strings with indefinite length (#961). Earlier
    versions of this library misinterpreted the CBOR standard and rejected
    input with the 0x7F start byte.
  * Fixed user-defined conversion to vector type (#924, #969). A wrong SFINAE
    check rejected code though a user-defined conversion was provided.
  * Fixed documentation of the parser behavior for objects with duplicate keys
    (#963). The exact behavior is not specified by RFC 8259 and the library now
    also provides no guarantee which object key is stored.
  * Added check to detect memory overflow when parsing UBJSON containers (#962
    ). The optimized UBJSON format allowed for specifying an array with
    billions of null elements with a few bytes and the library did not check
    whether this size exceeded max_size().

  Further Changes

  * Code coverage is now calculated for the individual header files, allowing
    to find uncovered lines more quickly than by browsing through the single
    header version (#953, #957).
  * A Makefile target run_benchmarks was added to quickly build and run the
    benchmark suite.
  * The documentation was harmonized with respect to the header inclusion (#955
    ). Now all examples and the README use #include <nlohmann/json.hpp> to
    allow for selecting single_include or include or whatever installation
    folder as include directory.
  * Added note on how to use the library with the cget package manager (#954).

  Deprecated functions

  This release does not deprecate any functions. As an overview, the following
  functions have been deprecated in earlier versions and will be removed in the
  next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):

  * Function iterator_wrapper are deprecated. Please use the member function
    items() instead.
  * Functions friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&) and
    friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&) are
    deprecated. Please use friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream&,
    basic_json&) and friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&)
    instead.


- Update to version 3.1.0
  Summary
  This release adds support for the UBJSON format and JSON Merge Patch. It also
  contains some minor changes and bug fixes. All changes are backward-compatible.
  
  New features
  * The library now supports UBJSON (Universal Binary JSON Specification) as
    binary format to read and write JSON values space-efficiently. See the
    documentation overview for a comparison of the different formats CBOR,
    MessagePack, and UBJSON.
  * JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) offers an intuitive means to describe patches
    between JSON values (#876, #877). See the documentation of merge_patch for
    more information.
  
  Improvements
  * The library now uses the Grisu2 algorithm for printing floating-point
    numbers (based on the reference implementation by Florian Loitsch) which
    produces a short representation which is guaranteed to round-trip (#360, #
    935, #936).
  * The UTF-8 handling was further simplified by using the decoder of Björn
    Hoehrmann in more scenarios.
 
  Reorganization
  * Though the library is released as a single header, its development got more
    and more complicated. With this release, the header is split into several
    files and the single-header file json.hpp can be generated from these
    development sources. In the repository, folder include contains the
    development sources and single_include contains the single json.hpp header
    (#700, #906, #907, #910, #911, #915, #920, #924, #925, #928, #944).
  * The split further allowed for a forward declaration header include/nlohmann
    /json_fwd.hpp to speed up compilation times (#314).
 
  Further changes
  * Google Benchmark is now used for micro benchmarks (see benchmarks folder, #
    921).
  * The serialization (JSON and binary formats) now properly work with the
    libraries string template parameter, allowing for optimized string
    implementations to be used in constraint environments such as embedded
    software (#941, #950).
  * The exceptional behavior can now be overridden by defining macros
    JSON_THROW_USER, JSON_TRY_USER, and JSON_CATCH_USER, defining the behavior
    of throw, try and catch, respectively. This allows to switch off C++'s
    exception mechanism yet still execute user-defined code in case an error
    condition occurs (#938).
  * To facilitate the interplay with flex and Bison, the library does not use
    the variable name yytext any more as it could clash with macro definitions
    (#933).
  * The library now defines NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MAJOR,
    NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_MINOR, and NLOHMANN_JSON_VERSION_PATCH to allow for
    conditional compilation based on the included library version (#943, #948).
  * A compilation error with ICC has been fixed (#947).
  * Typos and links in the documentation have been fixed (#900, #930).
  * A compiler error related to incomplete types has been fixed (#919).
  * The tests form the UTF-8 decoder stress test have been added to the test
    suite.
 
  Deprecated functions
  * Function iterator_wrapper has been deprecated (#874). Since its
    introduction, the name was up for discussion, as it was too technical. We
    now introduced the member function items() with the same semantics.
    iterator_wrapper will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0).

  Furthermore, the following functions are deprecated since version 3.0.0 and
  will be removed in the next major version (i.e., 4.0.0):
  
  * friend std::istream& operator<<(basic_json&, std::istream&)
  * friend std::ostream& operator>>(const basic_json&, std::ostream&)

  Please use friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream&, basic_json&) and
  friend operator<<(std::ostream&, const basic_json&) instead.
