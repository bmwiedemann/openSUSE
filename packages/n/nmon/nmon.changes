Mon Sep  4 10:32:34 UTC 2023 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 16p:
  * Small improvements to on-screen use only :
    + CLI -B and GUI 'B' to toggle boxes around stats.
    + CLI -^ and '^' to change units for Disk I/O KB/s -> MB/s -> GB/s.
      This happen temporarily too if the size of the statistic
      will not fit on-scree. 
  * Code changed to ensure clean compile for GCC 12

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 10 13:41:59 UTC 2022 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 16n:
  * 0 maximum CPUs for the Power10 E1080 (needed for massive Linux running SAP
    HAMA servers) and small fixes 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 12 14:18:32 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 16m:
  * Fix only effect POWER LPARs in the rarely used (IMHO) Dedicated
    Donating mode, which is actually more like Shared CPU than
    Dedicated so Shared CPU LPAR stats are now switched on. This is
    the mode choosen for most SAP HANA workloads on POWER. Does not
    effect AMD64 or other platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 18 09:22:37 UTC 2019 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 16j:
  * Newer Linux kernels do not have the SharedMem statistic so it
    reported instead the Shmem statsitic - this is the same shared
    memory number but includes RAM disk
  * Disk service times captured to file: Calculation corrections for
    Disk Group DGREADSERV & DGWRITESERV (missing device by elapsed time)
  * Disk DGIOTIME captured to file: removed (duplicate of DGBUSY as
    the millisecond doing IOTOME are used to calculate %busy for Disk
    Groups this is the percent time of all disks in the group)
  * POWER partition stats on screen label (Memory Desired fixed)
  * LARGEMEM removed and SMALLMEM only for very old Linux
  * GETUSER and JFS removed
  * KERNEL_2_6_18 for new kernels changed to PRE_KERNEL_2_6_18 only
    for older kernels

- Update to version 16i:
  * If using the -F option there was rare chance the filename gets a
    few random characters at the end.
  * From Linux kernel 2.8.19 onwards nr_slab was removed and
    nr_slab_reclaimable & nr_slab_unreclaimable added.
  * Online MHz stats (M) on small VM still took up 20 lines. Now
    reduced in size.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 10 13:06:47 UTC 2019 - Martin Pluskal <mpluskal@suse.com>

- Update to version 16h:
  * Internal code changes for robustness malloc() and
    snprintf/strncpy. 
  * POWER pool_capacity now correctly divided by 100. 
  * Online view ARM lscpu command column format depends on your
    hardware
  * Online view ALL /proc/cpuinfo format depends on your hardware
    and new lines - like MMU: Hash or MMU:
  * Online view POWER Welcome panel on POWER reports the top MHz 
- Drop manpage generation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 18 12:39:35 UTC 2018 - aloisio@gmx.com

- Update to version 16g
  Small changes only: 
  * Now cope with 192 physical CPU cores with SMT=8 (for POWER8
    servers)
  * Fixed bug reported with NFS automount in data capture mode
    + Alternatively, completely switch off JFS stats in capture
      mode with "-J" 
  * Online view: remove File systems that are "not real" to
    reduce screen space. Hit "j" and then "J" to remove the
    pointless file systems
  * Online view: Small clean up of the titles for the Memory
    stats (m)

Fri Apr  8 18:44:06 UTC 2016 - mpluskal@suse.com

- Update to 16e (boo#974718)
  * Boottime shown online in the Kernel "k" panel 
  * Utilisation stats: /proc/stat now reports 10 Utilisation stats 
    including KVM guest VM CPU use = cool.
  * Bug caused Seg Faults core dumps fixed while collecting to a 
    file including top process stats.
  * Fix: Improved memory handling for extreme numbers of processes 
    (1000's) or rapid exec of processes  (100's in a millisecond) 
    for large Linux servers. We have examples on Intel of 80 CPU 
    cores and POWER 160+
  * Online Dot "." command no longer also changes what is displayed 
    as users said it was confusing. 
  * Minor online start-up flash screen text changes to include C 
    concise CPU stats and U for full  Utilisation stats (all 10 of 
    them) instead of a file. 
  * Copyright and GPL v3 notice in the code plus online "h" and 
    nmon -h output

Fri Oct  4 01:36:28 UTC 2013 - malcolmlewis@opensuse.org

- Updated to version 14i:
  + 2nd attempt at fixing my NFS stats bug - thanks to helpful
    users.
  + Dynamic memory handling for massive /proc/cpuinfo file & so
    much duplication & Tabs chars plus many formats on x86.
  + POWER has new LPAR details on the CPU stats online,
    Entitlement, Physical CPU used, Capped, SMT level, virtual
    Processors and Dotted lines on each primary thread helps you
    "see" the physical CPUs, plus file output saves the above,
    lparstat -i, ppc64_cpu & lsslot, ls-veth/vdev/vscsi, lscfg &
    bootlist commands output, saves SMT on the LPAR tab last
    column.
  + Start up flash panel has X86 or POWER CPU details. Note: some
    x86 Virtual Machines report CPU type QEMU or Virtual CPU but
    many don't.
  + Add -D X86 in the makefile to get the new features.
- Updates from version 14h:
  + This included a fix for POWER based machines when the
    Entitlement CPU is set below 10% of a CPU - only applies to
    the POWER7+ processors or POWER7 that has a firmware upgrade
    like Power 770/780/79 and a fix for a crash if you gather NFS
    serving stats on certain Linux distributions & versions.
