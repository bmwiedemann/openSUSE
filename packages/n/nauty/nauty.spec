%description
nauty and Traces are programs for computing automorphism groups of
graphs and digraphs (*Traces does not accept digraphs at this time).
They can also produce a canonical label. They are written in a
portable subset of C, and run on a considerable number of different
systems.

There is a small suite of programs called gtools included in the
package. For example, geng can generate non-isomorphic graphs very
quickly. There are also generators for bipartite graphs, digraphs,
and multigraphs.
