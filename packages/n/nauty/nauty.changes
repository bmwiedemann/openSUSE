  * The -B/--B switch of listg/countg is now
    isomomorphism-invariant.

- Update to new upstream release 2.7~rc2
  * -h and -k options for independent set size and clique size
    were added to countg and pickg. For some graphs these use the
    program cliquer.
  * Added option -a to complg.
  * Program copyg can now be used to make a simple filter.
  * Programs countg and pickg can now display some parameter values
    as ranges instead of writing a separate line for each value.
  * Program vcolg now handles digraphs and graphs with loops.
  * genrang can now make random spanning trees of K(n1,n2)
  * amtog has an "s" command for reading tournaments
  * genspecialg can now make multiple special graphs at once.
    The -b option has been extended to allow removing a matching
    from a complete bipartite graph.
  * See /usr/share/doc/packages/nauty/changes24-27.txt for details.

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.10
  * Problems with input of graphs with 0 vertices were fixed.
    Many utilities in the package will not work with such graphs.
    It is NOT TRUE that graphs of order 0 are now supported.
  * Stronger measures are taken to ensure that the sort order
    used by shortg is plain byte order. This corresponds to the C
    collation order, also known as POSIX, but it may be different
    from the collation order used by default on your command
    line. This means that utilities like sort, uniq, comm and
    join might consider the output of shortg to be out of order.
    To avoid this, define the environment variable LC_ALL to
    equal the string "C":
  * bash: export LC_ALL=C
  * tcsh: setenv LC_ALL C
  * If LC_ALL is undefined, it will also be sufficient to define
    LC_COLLATE to equal "C". The POSIX standard says that LC_ALL
    takes precedence over LC_COLLATE if both are defined, but
    this might not be true for older systems.

- Update to new upstream release 2.6.7;
  initial version for build.opensuse.org
  * Switch from Non-Commercial Non-Military license to Apache-2.0
  * The "dreadnaut" tool now catches control-C when nauty or Traces
    is running. This uses the global variable nauty_kill_request.
  * dreadnaut: new command "vv" to display sorted degree sequence.
  * dreadnaut: new command "r&" to relabel according to the
    partition.
  * dreadnaut: new command "->>" to flush the output.
  * dreadnaut: new command "B" to turn on output flushing at the
    end of every command. Command "-B" turns it off. Default off.
  * dreadnaut: Command with short arguments now have to be all on
    one line. Most errors cause the rest of the input line to be
    skipped.
  * dreadnaut: The "R" command now preserves the colouring.
  * The "nauty" tool has an extra hook usercanonproc().
  * nauty: The maximum number of vertices is now 2 billion.
- Add nauty-am.diff, nauty-uninitialized.diff
