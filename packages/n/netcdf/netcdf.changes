  * [Enhancement] Improve filter installation process to avoid use
    of an extra shell script. See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2348.
  * [Bug Fix] Get "make distcheck" to work See
    gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#/2343.
  * [Enhancement] Allow the read/write of JSON-valued Zarr
    attributes to allow for domain specific info such as used by
    GDAL/Zarr. See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2278.
  * [Enhancement] Turn on the XArray convention for NCZarr files by
    default. WARNING, this means that the mode should explicitly
    specify nczarr" or "zarr" even if "xarray" or "noxarray" is
    specified. See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2257.
  * [Enhancement] Update the documentation to match the current
    filter capabilities See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2249.
  * [Enhancement] Support installation of pre-built standard
    filters into user-specified location. See
    gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2318.
  * [Enhancement] Improve filter support. More specifically (1)
    add nc_inq_filter_avail to check if a filter is available, (2)
    add the notion of standard filters, (3) cleanup szip support
    to fix interaction with NCZarr. See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2245.
  * [Enhancement] Switch to tinyxml2 as the default xml parser
    implementation. See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#2170.
  * [Bug Fix] Require that the type of the variable in
    nc_def_var_filter is not variable length.
    See gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#/2231.
  * [File Change] Apply HDF5 v1.8 format compatibility when
    writing to previous files, as well as when creating new files.
    The superblock version remains at 2 for newly created files.

- Removed generation of libsrc/ncx.c:
  This was an issue with an older version and has been fixed since.
  With this, no longer requiring m4 explicitly.
- Valgrind is used for validation tests only, these have not been
  performed. When they were added some of them failed. This requires
  further investigations. For now, valgrind testing has been made
  optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  6 11:54:21 UTC 2021 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Gcc11 has raised the bar on strict aliasing requirements even
  further. This has given rise to seemingly senseless warnings
  like:
  ncx.c: In function 'ncx_putn_float_double':
  ncx.c:272:20: warning: 'xx' may be used uninitialized [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
      272 |     uint32_t tmp = *(uint32_t*)src;
          |                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  ncx.c:3562:14: note: 'xx' was declared here
     3562 |     ix_float xx = NC_FILL_FLOAT;
          |              ^~
  but what is worse, data in netcdf files is missing. Luckily, this
  was caught by the test suite.
  These warnings and further type punning warnings should be fixed
  eventually. However, for now, lets cry defeat, disable strict
  aliasing and get netcdf back working again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  4 06:50:29 UTC 2021 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Add build support for gcc11 to HPC build.
- Update to version 4.7.4.
  * Enhancements:
    - Bump the NC_DISPATCH_VERSION from 2 to 3
    - Better cross platform path name management. This converts paths for
      various platforms (e.g. Windows, MSYS, etc.) so that they are in
      the proper format for the executing platform. See Github #1958.
    - Add support for storing NCZarr data in zip files. See Github #1908.
    - Optimizations to NCZarr, cleanup of code cruft, NCZarr test cases,
      performance test to NCZarr. See Github #1942.
    - Provide .rc fields for S3 authentication: HTTP.S3.ACCESSID and
      HTTP.S3.SECRETKEY.
    - Give the client control over what parts of a DAP2 URL are URL
      encoded (i.e. xx). This is to support the different decoding
	 rules that servers apply to incoming URLS. See Github #1884 for
	 more information.
    - Added new parallel I/O benchmark program to mimic NOAA UFS data
      writes. See [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/1777].
    - Add support for cloud storage using a variant of the Zarr storage
      format. Warning: this feature is highly experimental and is subject
	 to rapid evolution
      [https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/overview-of-zarr-support-in].
    - When a filter is applied twice with different parameters, the
      second set is used for writing the dataset
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1713].
  * Bug Fixes:
    - The nccopy program was treating -d0 as turning deflation on rather
      than interpreting it as "turn off deflation". See Github #1944.
    - Make fillmismatch the default for DAP2 and DAP4; too many servers
      ignore this requirement.
    - Fix some memory leaks in NCZarr, fix a bug with long strides in
      NCZarr. See Github #1913.
    - Implement a better chunk cache system for NCZarr. The cache now
      uses extendible hashing plus a linked list for provide a combination
	 of expandibility, fast access, and LRU behavior. See Github #1887.
    - Fix incorrect time offsets from ncdump -t, in some cases when the
      time units attribute contains both a non-zero time-of-day, and a
      time zone suffix containing the letter "T", such as "UTC". See
      Github #1866.
    - Cleanup the NCZarr S3 build options. See Github #1869.
    - Support aligned access for selected ARM processors. See Github #1871.
    - Revert the internal filter code to simplify it. From the user's
      point of view, the only visible change should be that (1) the
      functions that convert text to filter specs have had their signature
      reverted and renamed and have been moved to netcdf_aux.h, and (2)
      Some filter API functions now return NC_ENOFILTER when inquiry is
      made about some filter. Internally, the dispatch table has been
      modified to get rid of the complex structures.
    - If the HDF5 byte-range Virtual File Driver is available) HDf5 1.10.6
      or later) then use it because it has better performance than the one
      currently built into the netcdf library.
    - Fixed byte-range support with cURL > 7.69. See
      https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/1798.
    - Added new test for using compression with parallel I/O:
      nc_test4/tst_h_par_compress.c. See
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/pull/1784].
    - Don't return error for extra calls to nc_redef() for netCDF/HDF5
      files, unless classic model is in use. See
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1779].
    - Now allow szip to be used on variables with unlimited
      dimension [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1774].
    - Fix nccopy to properly set default chunking parameters when
      not otherwise specified. This can significantly improve performance
      in selected cases. Note that if seeing slow performance with nccopy,
      then, as a work-around, specifically set the chunking parameters.
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1763].
    - Fix some protocol bugs/differences between the netcdf-c library and
      the OPeNDAP Hyrax server. Also cleanup checksum handling
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1712].*
    - IMPORTANT: Ncgen was not properly handling large data sections.
      The problem manifests as incorrect ordering of data in the created
      file. Aside from examining the file with ncdump, the error can be
      detected by running ncgen with the -lc flag (to produce a C file).
      Examine the file to see if any variable is written in pieces as
      opposed to a single call to nc_put_vara. If multiple calls to
      nc_put_vara are used to write a variable, then it is probable
      that the data order is incorrect. Such multiple writes can occur
      for large variables and especially when one of the dimensions is
      unlimited.
    - Add necessary __declspec declarations to allow compilation
      of netcdf library without causing errors or (_declspec related)
      warnings
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1725].
    - Now larger cache settings are used for sequential HDF5 file
      creates/opens on parallel I/O capable builds; see Github #1716.
    - Add functions to libdispatch/dnotnc4.c to support dispatch
      table operations that should work for any dispatch table, even
	 if they do not do anything; functions such as nc_inq_var_filter
      [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1693].
    - Fixed a scalar annotation error when scalar == 0; see Github #1707.
    - Use proper CURLOPT values for VERIFYHOST and VERIFYPEER; the
      semantics for VERIFYHOST in particular changed. Documented in
      NUG/DAP2.md.
      See [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1684].
    - [cmake] Correct an issue with parallel filter test logic in
      CMake-based builds.
    - Now allow nc_inq_var_deflate()/nc_inq_var_szip() to be called for
      all formats, not just HDF5. Non-HDF5 files return NC_NOERR and
      report no compression in use. This reverts behavior that was changed
      in the 4.7.4 release.
      See [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1691].
    - Compiling on a big-endian machine exposes some missing forward
      delcarations in dfilter.c.
  * Documentation:
    - Migrated the documents in the NUG/ directory to the dedicated NUG
      repository found at https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf
  * Remove obsolete:

  HPC packages ignoring proper ABI versioning (boo#1179521).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov  6 13:44:53 UTC 2020 - Ana Guerrero Lopez <aguerrero@suse.com>

- Update to version 4.7.4.
  * Support has been added for HDF5-1.12.0. 
  * Support has been added for multiple filters per variable.
  * Now nc_inq_var_szip retuns 0 for parameter values if szip is not in
    use for var.
  * Now allow parallel I/O with filters, for HDF5-1.10.3 and later.
  * Increased default size of cache buffer to 16 MB, from 4 MB. Increased
    number of slots to 4133.
  * Allow zlib compression to be used with parallel I/O writes, if HDF5
    version is 1.10.3 or greater. 
  * Restore use of szip compression when writing data (including writing
    in parallel if HDF5 version is 1.10.3 or greater).
  * Enable use of compact storage option for small vars in netCDF/HDF5 files.
  * Updated benchmarking program bm_file.c to better handle very large files.
  * Added version number to dispatch table, and now check version with
    nc_def_user_format().
  * Increased size of maximum allowed name in HDF4 files to NC_MAX_NAME.
  * Bug Fixes:
    - Correct behavior for the command line utilities when
      directly accessing a directory using utf8 characters.
    - Attempts to set filters or chunked storage on scalar vars will now
      return NC_EINVAL. Scalar vars cannot be chunked, and only chunked
      vars can have filters. Previously the library ignored these attempts,
      and always storing scalars as contiguous storage.
    - Fixed problem of growing memory when netCDF-4 files were
      opened and closed.
  Further details can be found at:
  https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/releases/tag/v4.7.4

  (both failed on tst_filter.sh) tracked upstream 
  via email subject [netCDF #XWG-388823]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 23 16:36:42 UTC 2020 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 10:23:26 UTC 2020 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Remove requirements for parallel-netcdf from non-HPC builds:
  without the '--enable-pnetcdf' configure option, this doesn't
  make sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 04:59:19 UTC 2020 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Remove build restrictions for SLE builds: build all flavors for
  SLE.
- Fix ldconfig args for HPC packages: no caching should be done
  as these libs are made available thru LD_LIBRARY_PATH tweaking.
- Adhere to common conventions regarding NetCDF and PnetCDF:
  NetCDF modules should be called 'netcdf' - regardless whether
  they are 'serial' or use MPI (boo#1174291).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 28 07:03:45 UTC 2020 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Build macro package netcdf-devel-data only for non-HPC builds
  (boo#1167947).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 22 09:49:02 UTC 2020 - Adrian Schröter <adrian@suse.de>

- Update to version 4.7.3:
  * Library was modified so that rewriting the same attribute happens without
    deleting the attribute, to avoid a limit on how many times this may be
    done in HDF5.
  * Now testing that endianness can only be set on atomic ints and floats.
  * Fix for subtle error involving var and unlimited dim of the same name, but
    unrelated, in netCDF-4. See [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1496].
  * Update for attribute documentation. See [https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1512].
  * Corrected assignment of anonymous (a.k.a. phony) dimensions in an HDF5 file.
  * Corrected an issue where protected memory was being written to with some pointer
    slight-of-hand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 30 14:21:21 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 28 15:44:00 UTC 2019 - Egbert Eich <eich@suse.com>

- Update to version 4.7.1:
  * Remove obsolete _CRAYMPP and LOCKNUMREC macros from
    code. Also brought documentation up to date in man page.
  * Remove obsolete and deprecated functions nc_set_base_pe()
    and nc_inq_base_pe() from the dispatch table. (Both functions
    are still supported in the library, this is an internal
    change only.)
  * Fix: Reverted nccopy behavior so that if no -c parameters are
    given, then any default chunking is left to the netcdf-c library
    to decide.
- Disable openmpi1 builds for SLE/Leap > 15.1.
- Enable openmpi3 builds for Leap and SLE > 15.1 (jsc#SLE-7773).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 24 06:32:32 UTC 2019 - Nicolas Morey-Chaisemartin <nmoreychaisemartin@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep  8 16:34:27 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library.
- Readd optflags to CFLAGS again. The motivating issue has been solved
  (https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/244), and without
  optflags the lto flags were only applied to parts of the build,
  causing broken static libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  6 16:37:27 UTC 2019 - Stefan Brüns <stefan.bruens@rwth-aachen.de>

- Bump soversion, use it in the files section (so it fails the next
  time the version update is omitted), and remove the rpmlintrc
  also hiding the problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. currently only SUSE products/projects are supported/
  b. non-HPC builds are not and have never been supported on SLE,
     on openSUSE they are provided for compatibility reasons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  4 07:34:49 UTC 2018 - adrian@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 12 08:36:09 UTC 2017 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 4.4.1.1:
  - Fixed an issue where ncgen would potentially crash or write
    incorrect netCDF4 binary data under very specific
    circumstances [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#323].
  - Updated documentation related to netCDF variable names and
    DAP2 access to reflect the undefined behavior potentially
    observed when DAP2 reserved keywords are used as netCDF
    variable names.
  - Fixed an issue with nc_inq_type() not returning proper value
    in some circumstances [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#317].
  - Corrected an issue related to test failures when
    --disable-utilities or -DENABLE_UTILITIES=OFF are specified
    when building with autotools or cmake, respectively
    [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#313].
  - Corrected a behavioral issue with the _NCProperties attribute
    taking up too much space [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#300],
    [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#301].
  - Corrected behavior for nc-config so that, if nf-config is
    found in system, the proper fortran-related information will
    be conveyed [gh#Unidata/netcdf-c#296].
- Add netcdf-disable-szip-linking.patch:  Disable building with
  szip support for now, since test nc_test4/tst_interops5.c fails
  otherwise; this is likely to be fixed with version 4.5.0 of
  netcdf, but requires big enough changes that we don't backport
  it here. Necessitates BuildRequires on libtool and running
  autoreconf before configure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb  9 12:40:18 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Explicitly BuildRequire m4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug  6 19:37:39 UTC 2016 - wbauer@tmo.at

  in Factory, see https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/244

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 31 16:09:16 UTC 2016 - virtuousfox@gmail.com

- Add 32bit version to satisfy libavfilter6-32bit

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 17 16:06:42 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Trim descriptions. (libnetcdf11 will be the prominently installed
  one and therefore retains it mostly.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 15 15:46:46 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- As far as I can find the settings file is only needed for 
  development.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul  5 11:17:16 UTC 2016 - adrian@suse.de

- update to version 4.4.1
  Details can be found in the RELEASE_NOTES file.
- Note: The combination of netCDF-C library versions earlier than
  4.4.1 and libhdf5 1.10.0+ should be avoided, as they will result
  in binary files not readable by systems using earlier libhdf5 versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 31 00:32:51 UTC 2016 - dvaleev@suse.com

- Regenerate ncx.c from ncx.m4. Tarball doesn't have fresh copy
  of it. https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/159 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 19:20:09 UTC 2016 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to version 4.4.0.  Highlights:
  * Added CDM-5 support.
  * Added support for opening in-memory file content.
  * Modified CMakeLists.txt to work with the re-organized cmake
    configuration used by the latest HDF5, 1.8.16, on Windows.
    Before this fix, netCDF would fail to locate hdf5 1.8.16 when
    using cmake on Windows.
  * Modified ncgen to properly handle the L and UL suffixes for
    integer constants to keep backward compatibility.
- Remove netcdf-correct_casting.patch, rendered irrelevant by
  upstream change.
- Remov upstream-included netcdf-codecleanup.patch and 
  netcdf-pkgconfig.patch
- Rebase netcdf-no_date_time.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 21 20:05:32 UTC 2015 - scorot@free.fr

- install netcdf_par.h which is skipped when mpicc in not detected 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 24 09:22:06 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Currently the regular, openmpi, and mpivachi2 versions of the
  library packages all provide the exact same libraries.  So any
  package built against the -devel package will end up with an
  "unresolvable" build error because there are multiple versions
  of the library it can use. To avoid this, I have added generic
  provides for the library package so packages can depend on the
  version they really need, avoiding these build issues.
- Depend on the correct regular, openmpi, and mpivachi2 versions of
  hdf, hdf5, and parallel-netcdf.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 27 11:11:12 UTC 2015 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Build with HDF4 support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Apr 18 11:13:30 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 4.3.3.1
  * When the NC_MPIPOSIX flag is given for parallel I/O access and 
    the HDF5 library does not have the MPI-POSIX VFD configured in, 
    the NC_MPIPOSIX flag is transparently aliased to the NC_MPIIO 
    flag within the netCDF-4 library.
  * DAP requests now always include a restraint. Due to a problem in
    version 4.3.2, no constraint was generated when all variables were
    requested.
  * Fixed the code for handling character constants in datalists in
    ncgen. Two of the problems were:
    - It failed on large constants
    - It did not handle e.g.
    - var = 'a', 'b', …
      in the same way that ncgen3 did.
- Changes from version 4.3.3
  * Fixed bug resulting in error closing a valid netCDF-4 file with
    a dimension and a non-coordinate variable with the same name. 
    [NCF-324](https://bugtracking.unidata.ucar.edu/browse/NCF-324)
  * Enabled previously-disabled shell-script-based tests for Visual
    Studio when `bash` is detected.
- Update netcdf-no_date_time.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  2 12:31:13 UTC 2014 - coolo@suse.com

- fix license for spdx 1.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  1 21:17:08 UTC 2014 - ocefpaf@gmail.com

- update to 4.3.2
  *  Improved type handling with respect to fill-values.
  *  Enabled netCDF-4 bit-for-bit reproducibility for nccopy and other
     applications (thanks to Rimvydas Jasinskas and Quincey Koziol).
  *  Improved cmake build process.
  *  As part of an ongoing project, the Doxygen-generated netCDF documentation
     has been reorganized. The goal is to make the documentation easier to
     parse, and to eliminate redundant material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 10 16:31:45 UTC 2014 - opensuse@dstoecker.de

- update to 4.3.1.1
  * Corrected a DAP issue reported by Jeff Whitaker related to
    non-conforming servers.
  * Corrected an issue with DAP tests failing in a 64-bit Cygwin
    environment. NCF-286
  * Add an extended format inquiry method to the netcdf API:
    nc_inq_format_extended. NC_HAVE_INQ_FORMAT_EXTENDED is defined
    in netcdf.h NCF-273
  * Fixed fill value handling for string types in nc4_get_vara().
  * Corrected behavior of nc_inq_unlimdim and nv_inq_unlimdims to
    report dimids in same order as nc_inq_dimids.
  * A number of previously-disabled unit tests were reviewed and
    made active.
  * When opening a netCDF-4 file, streamline the iteration over
    objects in the underlying HDF5 file.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 failure when renaming a dimension and renaming
    a variable using that dimension, in either order. NCF-177
  * When compiling with hdf4 support, both autotools and cmake-based
    builds now properly look for the libjpeg dependency and will link
    against it when found (or complain if it's not). Also added
    ENABLE_HDF4_FILE_TESTS option to CMake-based builds.
  * Fixed bug in ncgen; it was not properly filling empty string
    constants ("") to be the proper length. NCF-279
  * Fixed bug in ncgen where it was interpreting int64 constants as
    uint64 constants. NCF-278
  * Fixed bug in handling Http Basic Authorization. The code was
    actually there but was not being executed. NCF-277
  * Added hack to the DAP code to address a problem with the
    Columbia.edu server. That server does not serve up proper DAP2 DDS
    replies. The Dataset {...} name changes depending on if the request
    has certain kinds of constraints. NCF-276
  * Fixed bugs with ncdump annotation of values, using -b or -f
    options. NCF-275
  * Added better documentation about accessing ESG datasets. See
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/esg.html.
  * Corrected an issue with CMake-based builds enabling HDF4 support
    where the HDF4 libraries were in a non-standard location.
  * Fix bug introduced by NCF-267 where octal constants above '\177'
    were not recognized as proper octal constants. NCF-271
  * Fixed an issue where the netcdf.3 man page was not being installed
    by CMake-based builds. Github
  * Modify ncgen to support NUL characters in character array
    constants. NCF-267
  * Modify ncgen to support disambiguating references to an enum
    constant in a data list. NCF-265
  * Corrected bug in netCDF-4 dimension ID ordering assumptions,
    resulting in access that works locally but fails through DAP
    server. NCF-166
  * Ensure netCDF-4 compiles with OpenMPI as an alternative to
    MPICH2. NCF-160
  * Addressed issue with hanging Parallel netCDF-4 using HDF5 1.8.10.
    NCF-240
  * Removed deprecated directories:
        librpc/
        udunits/
        libcf/
        libcdmr/
  * Added configure and accompanying configuration files/templates to
    release repository. These will only be added to tagged releases
    on GitHub.
  * Integrated a fix by Quincey Koziol which addressed a variation of
    NCF-250, Fix issue of netCDF-4 parallel independent access with
    unlimited dimension hanging.
  * Integrated change contributed by Orion Poplawski which integrated
    GNUInstallDirs into the netCDF-C CMake system; this will permit
    systems that install into lib64 (such as Fedora) to make install
    without problem.
  * Corrected an error with the CMake config files that resulted in the
    netcdf.3 manpage not being built or installed.
  * Added nc_rename_grp to allow for group renaming in netCDF-4 files. NCF-204
  * Added a NC_HAVE_RENAME_GRP macro to netcdf.h, as per a request by
    Charlie Zender. This will allow software compiling against netcdf
    to easily query whether or not nc_rename_grp() is available.
  * Added Greg Sjaardema's contributed optimization for the nc4_find_dim_len
    function in libsrc4/nc4internal.c. The patch eliminates several
    malloc/free calls that exist in the original coding.
  * Added support for dynamic loading, to compliment the dynamic loading
    support introduced in hdf 1.8.11. Dynamic loading support depends on
    libdl, and is enabled as follows: NCF-258
        autotools-based builds: –enable-dynamic-loading
        cmake-based builds: -DENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOADING=ON
  * Fix issue of netCDF-4 parallel independent access with unlimited
    dimension hanging. Extending the size of an unlimited dimension in
    HDF5 must be a collective operation, so now an error is returned if
    trying to extend in independent access mode. NCF-250
  * Fixed bug with netCDF-4's inability to read HDF5 scalar numeric
    attributes. Also allow, in addition to zero length strings, a new
    NULL pointer as a string value. to improve interoperability with
    HDF5. This required a new CDL constant, 'NIL', that can be output
    from ncdump for such a string value in an HDF5 or netCDF-4 file.
    The ncgen utility was also modified to properly handle such NIL
    values for strings. NCF-56
  * Fix contributed by Nath Gopalaswamy to large file problem reading
    netCDF classic or 64-bit offset files that have a UINT32_MAX flag
    for large last record size of a variable that has values larger than
    1 byte. This problem had previously been fixed for writing such data,
    but was only tested with an ncbyte variable.
  * Fixed various minor documentation problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 21 12:53:54 UTC 2013 - toddrme2178@gmail.com

- Update to 4.3.0
  * fsync: Changed default in autotools config file; fsync must
    now be explicitely enabled instead of explicitely disabled.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug where odometer code for libdap2 mishandled
    stride > 1. Bug reported by Ansley Manke.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug where netCDF would ignore the HDF5 reference
    type in the file, instead of rejecting the file as it should.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug with particular order of creation of
    dimensions, coordinate variables, and subgroups resulting in
    two dimensions with the same dimension ID.
  * Fixed netCDF-4 bug with a multidimensional coordinate variable
    in a subgroup getting the wrong dimension IDs for its
    dimensions.
  * Fixed bug with incorrect fixed-size variable offsets in header
    getting written when schema changed for files created by
    parallel-netcdf. Thanks to Wei-keng Liao for developing and
    contributing the fix.
  * Fixed bug in handling old servers that do not do proper
    Grid to Structure conversions.
  * Replaced the oc library with oc2.0
  * Fix bug with nc_get_var1_uint() not accepting unsigned ints
    larger than 2**31.
  * Fix to convert occurrences of '/' in DAP names to %2f.
  * Fix bug in netCDF-4 with scalar non-coordinate variables with
    same name as dimensions.
  * Fix bug in which calling netCDF-4 functions in which behavior
    that should not depend on order of calls sometimes produces
    the wrong results.
  * Merged in nccopy additions from Martin van Driel to support 
    -g and -v options for specifying which groups or variables are
    to be copied.
  * Merged in parallel-netcdf bugs fixes from Greg Sjaardema.
  * Modify ncgen so that if the incoming file has a special
    attribute, then it is used to establish the special property of
    the netcdf file, but the attribute is not included as a real
    attribute in the file..
  * Added library version info to the user-agent string so that the
    server logs will be more informative.
  * Added work around for bad servers that sometimes sends DAP
    dataset with duplicate field names.
  * Fixed bug with strided access for NC_STRING type.
  * Prevented adding an invalid _FillValue attribute to a variable
    (with nonmatching type or multiple values), to avoid later
    error when any record variable is extended.
  * Fix bug in which some uses of vlen within compounds causes HDF5
    errors.
  * Fixed ncdump bug in display of data values of variables that use 
    multiple unlimited dimensions.
  * Fix bug in which interspersing def_var calls with put_var calls
    can lead to corrupt metadata in a netCDF file with groups and
    inherited dimensions.
  * Building shared libraries works with DAP and netCDF4 
    functionality.
  * 32-and-64-bit builds are working under MinGW on Windows.
  * Config.h for Windows compiles are included in the build.
  * NetCDF-4 dependency on NC_MAX_DIMS has been removed.
  * 64-bit DLL's are produced on Windows.
  * DLL Packaging issues are resolved.
  * The CMake build system (with related ctest and cdash systems 
    for testing) has been integrated into netCDF-C. This allows for
    Visual Studio-based builds in addition to gcc-based builds.
    This requires at least CMake version 2.8.8. This 
    replaces/supplements the cross-compiled set of Visual-Studio
    compatible netCDF libraries introduced in netCDF 4.2.1-rc1.

Tue May 19 17:15:44 CEST 2009 - prusnak@suse.cz

- updated to 4.0.1
  * Added optional arguments to F90 API to nf90_open/create,
    nf90_create_var, and nf90_inquire_variable so that all netCDF-4
    settings may be accomplished with optional arguments, instead
    of separate function calls.
  * Added control of HDF5 chunk cache to allow for user performance
    tuning.
  * Added parallel example program in F90.
  * Changed default chunking to better handle very large variables.
  * Made contiguous the default for fixed size data sets with no
    filters.
  * Fixed bug in nc_inq_ncid; now it returns NC_ENOGRP if the named
    group is not found.
  * Fixed man pages for C and F77 so that netCDF-4 builds will
    result in man pages that document new netCDF-4 functions.
  * Added OPeNDAP support based on a new C-only implementation.
    This is enabled using --enable-dap option and requires libcurl.
    The configure script will attempt to locate libcurl, but if it
    fails, then its location must be specified by the --with-curl
    option.
  * Changed chunksizes to size_t from int.
  * Fixed fill value problem from F77 API.
  * Fixed problems in netcdf-4 files with multi-dimensional
    coordinate variables.
  * Fixed ncgen to properly handle CDL input that uses Windows line
    endings ("\r\n"), instead of getting a syntax error.
  * Added "-s" option to ncdump to display performance
    characterisitics of netCDF-4 files as special virtual attributes,
    such as _Chunking, _DeflateLevel, _Format, and _Endianness.
  * Added "-t" option to ncdump to display times in human readable
    form as strings.  Added code to interpret "calendar" attribute
    according to CF conventions, if present, in displaying
    human-readable times.
  * Added experimental version of ncgen4 capable of generating
    netcdf-4 data files and C code for creating them. In addition,
    it supports the special attributes _Format, etc.
  * Fixed Fortran 90 int64 problems.
  * Rewrote HDF5 read/write code in accordance with performance advice
    from Kent.
  * Fixed memory leaks in gets/puts of HDF5 data.
  * Fixed some broken tests for parallel I/O (i.e. MPI) builds.
  * Fixed some cross-compile problems.
  * Rewrote code which placed bogus errors on the HDF5 error stack,
    trying to open non-existant attributes and variables. Now no HDF5
    errors are seen.
  * Removed man subdirectory. Now man4 subdirectory is used for all
    builds.
  * Changed build so that users with access to parallel make can
    use it.
  * Added experimental support for accessing data through OPeNDAP
    servers using the DAP protocol (use --enable-opendap to build it).
  * Fixed ncdump bugs with array field members of compound type
    variables.  Fixed ncdump bug of assuming default fill value
    for data of type unsigned byte.
