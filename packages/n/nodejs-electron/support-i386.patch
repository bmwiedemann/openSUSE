description: don't disable i386 builds on linux

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3583780

Chromium upstream decided to kill off i386 builds on Linux. They were
goin to add a 'force_x86_support' arg, but instead "[distributions that
still support i386] can patch the file."

At this point, i386 on linux is completely unsupported upstream, so
we're on our own with bugs.
