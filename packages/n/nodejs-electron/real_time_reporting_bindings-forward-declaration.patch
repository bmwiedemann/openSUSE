Subject: [PATCH] libstdc++: real time reporting bindings vector requires full
 declaration
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

libstdc++ implementation of std::vector requires the full declaration
of the type and not a forward declaration. This breaks compilation of
RealTimeReportingBindings, as it has an std::vector of
RealTimeReportingContributionPtr.
