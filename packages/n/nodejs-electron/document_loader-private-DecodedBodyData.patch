Subject: [PATCH] GCC: declare DocumentLoader::DecodedBodyData as public

Fix build with GCC as DocumentLoader::DecodedBodyData was not
declaring SameSizeAsDocumentLoader. This works in Clang because
declaring it as friend of DocumentLoader implicitly declares it
as friend of its class members. But GCC does not accept that.
