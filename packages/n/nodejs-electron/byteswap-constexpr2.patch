description: fix constexpr FTBFS on i386/armhf

Fix a build error that was already fixed in base/sys_byteorder.h. But
since chromium has two copies of this file, it needs to also be fixed
here. It only shows up on 32-bit platforms.

ByteSwap is being called from another function that's constexpr, so
it also needs to be marked as constexpr. Ideally the calling code needs
to be changed to only have one copy of sys_byteorder.h.
