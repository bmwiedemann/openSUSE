Mon Feb  6 11:46:52 UTC 2023 - Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.com>

- Updated to version 1.2.2
  - Restore/cleanup NTPv1 support
    - ntpq sysstats now shows NTPv1 traffic.
    - NTPv1 counter added to sysstats log file.
    - NTS supports partial wildcards, for example *.example.com
    - Work on documentation, ntpdate, ntpheat, ntploggpg, ntpq's sysstats, ntpviz, and seccomp.
    - NTP auth no longer breaks on NULs.
    - The NTS server now saves 10 days worth of cookie keys. This will allow clients that only poll once a day to use NTS without using NTS-KE to keep cookies up to date.
    - rawstats now logs dropped packets and their BOGON code
      - Only one per request to avoid DoSing the log file
      - This lets you see packets that take too long.
    - Add 4 or 6 to DNS/NTS RefID tags to indicate that the DNS or NTS-KE has succeeded but NTP has not worked yet.
    - Build improvements
      - Restore Python 2.6 support
      - Restore LibreSSL support
      - Add support for OpenSSL 3.0
    - Fix hash validation in ntpleapfetch again.
    - FreeBSD now gets nanosecond resolution on receive time stamps.
- added ntpsec.keyring

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 12 06:17:37 UTC 2021 - Johannes Segitz <jsegitz@suse.com>

- Added hardening to systemd service(s) (bsc#1181400). Added patch(es):
  * harden_ntp-wait.service.patch
  * harden_ntpd.service.patch
  * harden_ntplogtemp.service.patch
  * harden_ntpviz-daily.service.patch
  * harden_ntpviz-weekly.service.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  9 15:20:20 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Update to version 1.2.1
  * Update ntpkeygen/keygone to properly filter # characters.
    Fix security issue: CVE-2021-22212
  * Add dextral peers mode in ntpq and ntpmon.
  * Drop NTPv1 as the support was not RFC compliant, maybe v2
    except mode 6 next.
  * Fix argument P for ntpd parsing fixed and ntpdate improvements.
  * Fix crash for raw ntpq readvar.
  * Add processor usage to NTS-KE logging except on NetBSD.
  * Remove --build-epoch and replace it with arbitrary
    --build-desc text. Passing
    '--build-desc=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%Sz)' restores the
    previous default extended version.
  * The build epoch has been replaced with a hardcoded timestamp
    which will be manually updated every nine years or so
    (approx 512w). This makes the binaries reproducible by default.
  * Compare versions of ntp.ntpc and libntpc printing a warning
    if mismatched. Fix libntpc install path if using it.
  * Reduce maxclocks default to 5 to reduce the NTP pool load.
  * Print LIBDIR during ./waf configure.
  * Add documentation, new GPG key, and other cleanups.
- Update to version 1.2.0
  * The minor version bump is to indicate official official support
    of RFC8915 "Network Time Security for the Network Time
    Protocol" which was released 2020-09-30.
  * NTS-KE client now defaults to port 4460.
  * NTS-KE server now listens on port 4460. (Listening on port 123
    has been removed.)
  * The shebang of installed Python scripts can now be customized
    with: waf configure --pyshebang="…" This has multiple uses, but
    one example is for distros (like CentOS 8 or Ubuntu 20.04) with
    no python executable: python3 waf configure
    --pyshebang="/usr/bin/env python3"
  * NTP clients now use a shared library with Python instead of an
    extension.
  * Add flakiness option to ntpq and fixed limit=1 in mrulist.
  * Fixed a minor formatting issue in rate page.
- Create subpackages for libntpc and ntpsec-devel

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan  8 17:21:57 UTC 2021 - Martin Hauke <mardnh@gmx.de>

- Let system-user-ntp handle the user/group generation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 29 07:25:07 UTC 2020 - Christophe Giboudeaux <christophe@krop.fr>

  * Correctly parse ntpq :config output on Python 3 and check
    return MACs.
  * Add AES and other algorithm support to ntpq and ntpdig,
    from OpenSSL.
  * Remove support for NetInfo.
  * The default restrictions now start with noquery and limited
    to reduce the opportunities for being used for DDoS-ing.
  * NTS client now requires ALPN on TLSv1.3.
  * asciidoctor (1.5.8 or newer) is now supported and is the
    preferred AsciiDoc processor.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 17 08:13:53 UTC 2020 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 14 08:22:05 UTC 2019 - Tomáš Chvátal <tchvatal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.1.7 bsc#1153841:
  * The numeric literal argument of the 'time1' fudge option on a clock
    can now have one or more letter suffixes that compensate for era
    rollover in a GPS device.  Each "g" adds the number of seconds in a
    1024-week (10-bit) GPS era. Each "G" adds the number of seconds in a
    8192-week (13-bit) GPS era.
  * The neoclock4x driver has been removed, due to the hardware and the
    vendor having utterly vanished from the face of the earth.
  * The NTS ALPN negotiation sequence has been modified for improved
    interoperability with other NTS implementations.
  * NTS key rotation now happens every 24 hours.  It used to rotate
    every hour to enable testing of recovery from stale cookies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 08:57:44 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

  * Log timestamps now include the year.  This is useful when
    investigating bugs involving time-setting and -g.
  * Many internal cleanups to clear the way for upcoming major features.
    They should generally not be user visible.  Refer to the git-log if
    you are interested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 29 10:43:16 UTC 2018 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 1.1.0:
  * Digests longer then 20 bytes will be truncated.
  * We have merged NTP Classic's fix for CVE-2018-7182.
  * we have dropped support for Broadcast servers.  We had kept it for
    older desktop operating systems listening on the local network
    broadcast domain, a use case that is now no longer in use at sane
    enviroments, and no longer necessary for modern desktop OSs.
  * It is now possible to unpeer refclocks using a type/unit specification
    rather than a magic IP address.  This was the last obligatory use of
    magic IP addresses in the configuration grammar.
  * OpenBSD has been removed from the list of supported platforms for
    ntpd. It will be restored if and when its clock API supports drift
    adjustment via ntp_adjtime() or equivalent facility.
  * Mac OS X support has been dropped pending the implementation of
    ntp_adjtime(2).
  * A bug that caused the rejection of 33% of packets from Amazon time
    service has been fixed.
