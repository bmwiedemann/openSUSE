- Update to version 0.92.1:
  * The configured hooks should again properly affect the scope

    Android/Termux (termux builds with default-no-clipboard).

    on all platforms and provide suggestions as comments.

    - Redirection: make o>, e>, o+e>'s target support variables
      and string interpolation.
    - Fix broken constants in scopes.
    - Fix: return all headers with the same name from http <method>.
    - make the behaviours of last and first more consistent.
    - Fix explore crashes on {}.
    - Fix: update engine_state when history.isolation is true (#9268).
    - Fix headers command handling of missing values.
    - fixes which showing aliases as built-in nushell commands.
    - fix the command cp -u src dst/mv -u src dst doesn't work when the…
  * Changes to commands:
    - which returns the type of the command instead of only whether
      it is builtin or not and uses more explicit column names.
    - str expand now allows empty member in brace expansion, e.g.
      A{,B,C} would expand to [A, AB, AC].
    - keybinding listen gives more information about keys like
      home and end, namely their kind and state.
    - input listen allows to query for a single key press, e.g.
      the following will take a 4-char input 1..4 | each
      { input listen } | where key_type == char | get code | str join.
    _ path commands lose the -c flag; instead, use update
      to update table columns.
  * Until now, declaration keywords such as let and mut have
    required the use of parentheses around pipelines to assign
    the output of a chain of command to a variable. this syntax
    has been relaxed for let and mut. Let's give some examples!
  * Input / output type checking and annotations.
  * Configuration tweaks.
  * The standard library.
  * Breaking changes:
    - Removal of let-env (now use the $env.FOO = "BAR" form instead).
    - Stricter checking of input/output types.

    - Split $nu variable into scope commands and simpler $nu.
    - The filesize prefixes Z/Zi have been removed as their
      underlying values where not correctly representable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 26 03:52:52 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.79.0:
  * Standard library.
  * enhanced IDE support in our VS code extension.

    - config nu and config env now open $nu.config-path and
      $nu.env-path, respectively.
    - Aliasing math expressions now shows error immediately instead
      of failing silently and showing a confusing error later.
    - exec inherits Nushell's environment variables.
    - NU_LIB_DIRS definition in env.nu changed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  5 13:57:51 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.78.0:
  * Pattern matching.
  * Aliases now can shadow.
  * Old alias still keeps working.
  * Speed improvements.
  * Optional cell path members.
  * better error handling in error make.

Sat Mar 18 17:29:16 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.77.1:
  * Fixes an issue related to subexpressions not properly
    handling output values.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 15 04:04:59 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.77.0:
  * Reworked aliases (Breaking changes!).
  * More consistent timestamp handling.
  * New XML format.
  * New additions to $nu.
  * Reworked http subcommands.
  * Breaking changes:
    - Alias changes, see above.
    - env command has been removed, use $env instead
      (https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8185).
    - str trim no longer has --all, --both, and --format flags.
      str replace should be an adequate replacement; please
      let us know if it is not (#8205).
    + The changes to timestamp handling noted above (#8244)
      can require code changes to existing scripts:
      - Saved data containing the results of an old
        datetime-to-timestamp conversion will not deserialize
        correctly when read back by the current version of Nushell.
        In general, Nushell will produce incorrect datetime
        values without noting an error.
      - <int> | into datetime now assumes nanosecond scaling
        for all timestamps. You must ensure all timestamps computed
        by your script or retrieved from external sources
        are scaled appropriately.
      - <date> | into int can now fail, as noted above. You cannot
        rely on this operation to persist a arbitrary date.
    - The change to from xml and to xml commands noted above (#7947)
      will require to update scripts relying on old
      output/input format.
    - mkdir, cp, mv and rm return nothing. Errors and actions with
      --verbose flag are printed to stderr instead (#8014).
    - Plugin authors relying on nu_protocol::Value may need to
      update their code to account for a change
      to Value::Error (#8375).
    - Different types of lists can now be appended.
      This can break scripts that were relying on the stricter
      bhavior (https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/8157).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 22 04:20:43 UTC 2023 - Soc Virnyl Estela <socvirnyl.estela@gmail.com>

- Add constraints. Make 12GB of physical memory.
- Update to version 0.76.0:
  * Fix PATH vs Path for command completions
  * New debugging commands
    - ast
    - debug
    - explain
  * BREAKING CHANGES:
    - load-env can not accidentally set $env.PWD anymore
    - The --numbered flag to enumerate entries has been removed from each, par-each,
      each while, and reduce. Use the enumerate command added in 0.75 instead.
    - Plugin system: nu_plugin::Plugin::signature has changed from
      fn signature(&self) -> Vec<Signature> to fn signature(&self) -> Vec<PluginSignature>
      to support examples on plugin commands. Plugin authors have to update
      the relative structure to apply these changes. Normally you just need to
      perform a global search/replace from Signature to PluginSignature,
      then rebuild and run with the latest nushell version.
    - benchmark renamed to timeit.
    - dataframe commands renamed with a prefix of dfr
    - view-source renamed to view source
    - Plugin commands can now include examples, which necessitated a change to
      the plugin signature, which causes all plugins to need to be recompiled for use
    - from ini, from vcf, from ics, from eml commands are moved to
      plugin called nu_plugin_formats to reduce the number of commands in nushell
      core, you need to install and register the plugin manually to use these command
    - str lpad and str rpad have been superceeded by fill in order to provide alignment
    - http get -t,--timeout parameter is now -m,--max-time.
    - Filesystem commands now print to stderr when using --verbose flag
    - The parse command will now create 0 indexed columns instead of 1 indexed

- Use zstd compression for vendored tarball

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  1 03:56:36 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.75.0:

  * Breaking changes to the web-related commands.
  * main command exported from module defines top-level module
    command.
  * Progress bar for save command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 10:19:23 UTC 2023 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.74.0:
  * Known externals commands and exec now have "fall-through"
    signatures.
  * help is now more helpful.
  * Initial support for parse-time constants.
  * New url encode command to percent-encode URLs.
  * values command to programmatically interact with records.
  * get, select, cell path access on tables will now error when
    encountering a hole.
  * Behavior of -i/--ignore-errors flag for get and select when
    the entire column is absent has changed.
  * Certain misused punctuation in def definitions are now errors.
  * $in now works in catch closures.
  * MIME-types are supported in ls with an additional flag.
  * Regular expression queries are cached for performance.
  * All built-in commands now declare their pipeline input
    and output types.
  * get and select now error when encountering a hole.
  * the behaviour of -i on get and select has changed.
  * columns will now error for data that is not a table or a record.
  * The dataframe specific command fill-na has been renamed to
    fill-nan to better represent its capabilities.
  * The requirements for the names of a nu command and a command
    alias have been tightened to avoid some problems.
  * to toml will only produce output for records now as the output
    for tables is ambiguous and may be invalid to parse.
  * exec and known externals don't throw errors when unknowns
    parameters are passed to them.
  * help command has been thoroughly refactored and includes
    several more subcommands. help <word> now matches commands,
    aliases, and modules.
  * command names in help commands and $nu.scope.commands are
    displayed correctly if they were imported from a module
    with a prefix.
  * hide command no longer hides environment variables.
    Use hide-env instead.
  * math eval has been removed in favour of the direct math
    commands and expressions (see help operators as well).
  * last, skip, drop, take until, take while, skip until,
    skip while, where, reverse, shuffle, and sort-by are now
    stricter about which types of data they accept.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 21 04:26:28 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.73.0:
  * The boolean && is now and and the boolean || is now or.
    These were deprecated in the 0.72 release and have now been
    removed. Existing scripts will need to be updated to the
    new syntax to run in 0.73.
  * Experimental interactive explore command.
  * New math commands.
  * Changes to commands with predicates:
    any, all, skip until, skip while, take until, and take while
    now accept a closure instead of a row condition.
  * New filter command and simpler where.
  * New command uniq-by.
  * Mutable data structures can now have their inner values mutated
    using =.
  * More sophisticated coloring of data values using closures.
  * save no longer overwrites files by default, you must use the
    new -f/--force flag to overwrite an existing file.
  * split row command will retain an empty string if splitted
    string is empty.
  * split list now properly removes the separator in all positions.
  * The --show-created-paths flag has been replaced by --verbose
    from mkdir.
  * fetch removes --output, --bin, --append flags, use fetch with
    save to save fetched page to a file.
  * changes to how get works with deep cell paths.
  * mkdir's -s/--show-created-paths has been renamed to
    -v/--verbose for better consistency.
  * && is now and and || is now or.
  * any, all, skip until, skip while, take until, take while
    now take only a closure as an argument.
  * where now takes only row condition argument, -b flag removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  6 03:55:57 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.72.1:
  * With this release, we have also statically linked OpenSSL
    into the binary to make it easier to use across a larger range
    of platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 30 14:47:58 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.72.0:
  * Try/catch. Starting with 0.72, it's now much easier to run
    a command that might fail and then handle the failure
    if it happens.
  * Auto-expanding data views. With the new default config,
    we now also detect the terminal width and will automatically
    expand the data view to include more information
    if it's available.
  * Redirection. This release also includes a new way
    of redirecting the stdout and/or stderr of external commands.
    This gives easier access to the output streams than was
    previously possible.
  * Closures/blocks. We have now split closures and blocks into
    two separate value types. A closure can have parameters,
    can close over variables outside of its scope,
    and can be passed as a value.
  * Mutation. Starting in this release, you can create local
    mutable variables. You can create mutable variables using
    the mut keyword.
  * Loop/while. The 0.72 release also includes a few new
    looping commands: loop and while.
  * Break/continue. Loops can now also use the break and continue
    feature common in many programming languages. break will break
    out of the current loop. And continue will continue the loop
    at the next iteration.
  * Return. The 0.72 release also includes the ability to return
    early from a closure or command.
  * Command refinement, simplification, and elimination.
  * Dataframes no longer included by default - smaller binaries.
  * Allow reloading overlay definitions.
  * virtualenv activation changes.
  * Nu's SQLite DSL commands have been removed.
    open foo.db and open foo.db | query db "SELECT * ..." still work,
    but the commands which mapped 1-to-1 with SQL clauses
    (ex: open foo.db | into db | select * | from table some_table
    | order-by some_column) have been removed. These commands were
    an interesting experiment but they didn't work out,
    and we're removing them to simplify database access in Nu.
  * The is_plugin, is_custom, and is_keyword columns in
    help commands have been replaced with a single
    command_type column.
  * date format now returns an error if not given an input.
    Previously it would default to the current time.
  * first and last will now return an error if given a negative index.
    Previously the behavior was undefined and may have returned
    entries due to an underflow.
  * The --predicate flag has been removed from find. where can be
    used in all situations where find --predicate was previously used.
  * sort-by now requires a column name to sort by.
    To sort lists without specifying a column name, sort can be used.
  * seq, seq char, and seq date no longer have --separator and
    --terminator flags (#7045, #7054, #7096). This helps ensure
    that the return type for those commands is consistent,
    and str join can be used to accomplish the same effect.
  * The build-string command has been removed. To concatenate strings,
    use the + operator, string interpolation, or str join.
  * wrap now expands ranges. It works the same as with lists or seq.
  * url parse url scheme, url host, url path, and url query
    commands have been removed. We added the command url parse.
    This new command returns a Record with scheme, username,
    password, host, path, query, params (as a Record) and fragment.
  * sort, sort-by, str contains and find have had their
    --insensitive flags renamed to --ignore-case.
    --ignore-case is used by uniq, as well as popular external
    commands like less, grep and wget, so it could be considered
    a standard flag name.
  * New boolean operator xor - Planned operator simplification.
    To complement our logical boolean operators and/&& and or/||
    we added boolean xor. This is consistent with bit-and, bit-xor,
    and bit-or. We are currently considering to deprecate the
    C-style symbols &&/|| in favor of the spelled out and/or to
    increase consistency and provide more actionable error
    messages when trying to use &&/|| in a similar fashion to bash.
  * Config options have been grouped together.
    The structure of $env.config (and thus the record used with
    let-env config = statements in config.nu and other places) has
    been reorganised. Various options are now grouped into subrecords
    (similar to table_trim) and had their names shortened.
    This allows config.nu files to be better structured,
    and thus easier to edit and read.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  9 05:18:21 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.71.0:
  * New ++ operator.
  * Improved consistency across commands and types.
  * Right prompts can now be on the last line.
  * Configuring the default value viewer via display_output hook.
  * Completion actions now more familiar.
  * New --force (-f) flag for the mv command. This change alters mv
    default behavior. By default overwriting existing files is now
    prevented (You can use alias mv = mv -f in you config to get
    the old defaults back).
  * The column name for the command name in $nu.scope.commands
    has been changed from command to name. Thus,
    $nu.scope.commands | where name =~ zip would give you
    specific command info.
  * The str distance command now directly returns an Int instead
    of a record {"distance": <Int>}.
  * The argument order of format filesize was made consistent
    with other commands that accept a CellPath to specify fields
    that should be affected by it. Now the string specifying
    the format is the first positional argument and the cell
    path is specified in the following positional argument(s).
  * The --perf flag for Nu was removed as part of an effort to
    simplify diagnostics logging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 19 03:18:53 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.70.0:
  * New table flags --expand
  * The command first 1 now returns a list with the single value
    rather than the value itself. This brings it in line with
    the behaviour of last 1.
  * The dataframe command with-sql or query dfr has been renamed
    to query df for consistency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 28 07:11:31 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead-mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.69.1:
  + Summary of deprecations
    - source.
    - source-env.
    - use.
    - hide.
    - hide-env.
    - export env.
    - export-env.
    - export ...
    - config.nu.
    - env.nu.
    - login.nu.
  * Upcoming virtualenv activation changes.
  * Grammar Experiments.
  + Breaking changes
    - We found a regression in the correctness of the -d and -t
      flags of touch. To get the release out, we've removed these
      flags, but hope to replace them with correct implementations
      in the future. We also removed support for duration literals
      above weeks, including month, year, and decade literals.
      These were found to be confusing as it's unclear what a
      duration of a month is (30 days? 31 days?) The str collect
      command is now str join.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 03:01:36 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.68.1:
  * This addresses a bug with blocks and source-env.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  7 15:38:25 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.68.0:
  * source becomes source-env.
  * Module envrionment changes.
  * Syntax unification.
  * Overlay changes.
  * Allow parentheses around command signatures.
  * We added a new command str distance which implements the
    Levenshtein alorithm.
  * We added string duration conversion to named durations.
  * External Completions (experimental).
  * Renaming of all? to all, any? to any, and empty? to is-empty.
  * Renaming overlay commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 17 06:52:00 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.67.0:
  * We have a new welcome banner.
  * WARNING! Breaking change!
  * Relative paths in scripts are file-relative.
  * Writing SQLite files.
  * Shell integration (Visual Studio Code).
  * The error message when an external command is not found has
    been improved.
  * Nushell now has a full array of bits and bytes commands for
    working with binary data.
  * A new hide-env command is added that can hide environmnet
    variables in the current scope.
  * The overlay add spam command would take all commands and aliases
    from the module and put them directly into the current namespace.
  * You can now change the name of the added overlay using the
    new as keyword.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 29 03:10:33 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.66.2:
  * Fix for a crash when using ls on an unknown directory.

  * Hotfix release of 0.66. It includes a fix for a crash when
    using ls on an unknown directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 27 04:00:56 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.66.0:
  * New table output.
  * Exit codes:
    - We've done work in this release that will cause pipelines
      and commands to stop a script from continuing if they hit
      a non-zero exit case, much in the same way as a && b in bash
      does not run b if a returns with a non-zero exit code.
    - This has been extended to also work when running the full
      script, so that nu itself will return an non-zero exit code
      matching the error the script saw when it stopped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  6 04:46:36 UTC 2022 - Dead Mozay <dead_mozay@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 0.65.0:
  * Better support for binary data:
    - New operators bit-and, bit-or, bit-xor, as well as
      renamed bit-shl and bit-shr. These correspond to bitwise and,
      or, exclusive or, shift left, and shift right.
    - A new encode command as well as binary support for hash.
    - Improved binary support for skip and take.
  * Nu-check:
    - Starting with this release, Nushell now provides a
      nu-check command which can do a check over a source file
      for potential parsing and typechecking errors.
  * Unification continues:
    - In this release, db and mysql support has simplified,
      bringing it closer to the already existing dataframe support.
  * Additional new commands:
    - You can now use the port command to find the next available port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 06:38:54 UTC 2022 - dead_mozay@opensuse.org

- Update to version 0.64.0:
  * Add --values flag to sort record by values,
    by default, sort record by keys, and sort not change shape,
    and path join support multi path, and fix arg parse, and While
    starting nu, force PWD to be current working directory,
    and handle SIGQUIT, and add as record tag to transfer
    result to record, and print warning message if meet non
    utf-8 path, and fix argument type, and expand env for path,
    and make ls works better with glob, and base64 command more
    friendly, and make cp can copy folders contains dangling symbolic
    link, and make sure no duplicate column exists during
    eval and merge.
  * Pin reedline v0.7.0 for the nushell v0.64.0 release, and
    Address lints from clippy for beta/nightly, and Use search
    terms in the help menu search, and Update nu-ansi-term to remove
    Deref impl, and Improve internal documentation of save command,
    and Update reedline, and Clarify error message for let in pipeline,
    and Update reedline: Support more bindings in vi mode, and Improve
    test coverage of command examples, and Add search terms for
    describe, and Unpin reedline for regular development.
  * Bool type for binary operations, and each while command,
