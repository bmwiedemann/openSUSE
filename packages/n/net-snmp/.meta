  <title>SNMP Daemon</title>
  <description>Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMP v1, SNMP v2c
and SNMP v3 using both IPv4 and IPv6. The suite includes:

- An extensible agent for responding to SNMP queries including built-in
  support for a wide range of MIB information modules
- Command-line applications to retrieve and manipulate information from
  SNMP-capable devices
- A daemon application for receiving SNMP notifications
- A library for developing new SNMP applications, with C and Perl APIs
- A graphical MIB browser.

This package was originally based on the CMU 2.1.2.1 snmp code. It was
renamed from cmu-snmp to ucd-snmp in 1995 and later renamed from ucd-snmp
to net-snmp in November 2000.</description>
