%description
This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Raku-like environment for virtual
machines. The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a very small
environment (as compared with, say, raku or Rakudo) and is focused on being
a high-level way to create compilers and libraries for virtual machines like
MoarVM, the JVM, and others.

Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Raku, NQP strives to have as small a
runtime footprint as it can, while still providing a Raku object model and
regular expression engine for the virtual machine.
