  <title>Character graphics and TUI library</title>
  <description>notcurses facilitates the creation of modern TUI programs, making
full use of Unicode and 24-bit TrueColor. Its API is similar
to that of NCURSES, but extends that with z-buffering, rendering
of images and video using ffmpeg, alpha blending, widgets, palette
fades, resize awareness, and multithreading support.
