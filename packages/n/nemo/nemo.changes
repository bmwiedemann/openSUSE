- Update to version 4.2.0:
  * nemo-view.c: Don't ignore non-symbolic extension menu icons.

- Update to version 4.0.6:
  * Packaging: Depend on cinnamon-l10n

  * nemo-list-view.c: Always display at the default list view zoom level during a search.
  * nemo-icon-view.c: Don't rely on the default icon zoom level for the grid desktop, hardcode to normal instead.
  * nemo-icon-view.c: Correctly initialize to the default view zoom level when ignore-metadata mode is active.
  * per-folder thumbnails: Remove toolbar thumbnail button preference, instead base visibility on the show-image-thumbnails preference.
  * nemo-window.c: Fix hidden menu alt-key activation.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Keep the selected bookmark scrolled into view when a selection is made on a bookmark.
  * nemo-list-view.c:  Ignore triple-clicks and reset the double-click last_click_time when the current double-click succeeds.
  * nemo-extension-config-widget.c: Allow description to be multi-line instead of reverting to a horizontal scroll bar.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Don't use fixed-height mode, it does not work well with zoom changes.
  * nemo-action.c: Don't include previously inserted characters/text in subsequent token matching - skip ahead based on the inserted text length, so we avoid potentially parsing escape codes that are part of a file's uri.
  * places and tree sidebars: Listen for action manager reloads, rebuild popup menus when needed.
  * places sidebar: Enable actions to work properly even when the item being right-clicked/context-menu'd is not the currently loaded view.
  * nemo-tree-sidebar.c: Fix memory leak.
  * nemo-file-management-properties.c: Don't drop builder object ref until the window is closed, as callbacks to setting changes refer to it still.
  * desktop/extension config: remove incorrect tooltips
  * nemo-desktop-overlay.c: Don't use g_clear_pointer to destroy a widget, this causes build warnings in newer glib.
  * nemo-properties-window.c: If the icon picker is spawned on a file that has an existing custom icon name or path, display it initially in the picker.
  * nemo-window-manage-views.c: When clearing thumbnails for a view refresh, drop the NemoIconInfo cache as well.
  * nemo-application.c: Check for "nemo" in the current theme, instead of "nemo-window". Remove unintentional additions to nemo-style- application.css which were made in 21a960712bf4d7688.
  * nemo-desktop: Simplify view layout preferences, other changes.
  * desktop overlay: Use normal window hints instead of hidden.  Allow resizing, assign an icon (and use XAppGtkWindow so the icon isn't blurry). Make sure all the action names are not marked as translate. Show the monitor plug name and dimensions when displaying view settings.
  * l10n: Update POT
  * Version bump for dev.
  * libnemo-extension: Refactor a bit, replace a lot of boilerplate with macros, simplify doc generation.  Documentation needs more work at some point.
  * nemo-file.c: Do a better job of figuring out the mimetype for empty files.
  * Add creation time (btime) support.
  * preferences window: Add toggle for creation date in tooltips.
  * nemo-file-info.h: Don't use G_DECLARE_INTERFACE - it doesn't allow us to properly use NemoFile for its vtable - it works but throws a ton of build warnings and isn't safe.
  * misc: Clean up build warnings
  * icon view: remove some deprecated paths (gtk doesn't return anything useful anymore.)
  * nemo-icon-canvas-item.c: Insert some space between the icon and label bounds in compact view.
  * nemo-statusbar.c: Remove custom scroll handler.  The gtk one works correctly now.
  * menus: Respect the gtk-menu-images preference for the primary 'open/ open-with' menu item.
  * meson.build: Add option to disable omit-frame-pointers from build (useful for perf profiling.)
  * icon container: Generate tooltips for icon items on-demand, instead of when the view loads.
  * meson.build: show profiling flag status in config summary.
  * nemo-icon-info: Optimize icon lookups by GIcon.
  * search: Respect the current state of the 'show hidden files' setting when calculating results.

  * nemo-view: Optimize *_get_selection(), don't create deep copies when not necessary.
  * nemo-file: Remove pixbuf cached in NemoFile.
  * nemo-list-model.c: Improve accounting for dummy expander row, so it more reliably removes the expander for empty folders.
  * nemo-file.c: Cache some heavily used values from date construction, particularly caching of the GTimeZone object for use in GDateTime construction.
  * icon view: Remove "tighter layout" option.
  * nemo-icon-info: don't implement as a gobject.
  * nemo-mime-actions.c: Don't offer the 'Make executable and run' option by default.

  * nemo-icon-view-container.c: Connect the tooltip signal per container instance, rather than once overall.
  * nemo-icon-info.h: Tweak text width a bit for the zoom levels.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Turn on hover prelight by default.  This helps label text overlapping adjacent items (during hover) to have a clean background for better legibility.
  * emblems: Use cached parent pointers when checking for can't-write emblem condition, instead of looking it up for each file.
  * nemo-file.c: Load file-roller mimetype cache upon first demand, instead of at startup.  This has a noticeable impact on startup time.
  * nemo-list-model.c: Reduce number of icon info lookups when creating icon surfaces for the model.
  * preferences: Use the new XApp sidebar switcher, and use an ordinary GtkWindow instead of a GtkDialog to clean up the look.  This includes removing the close button as well (we already don't use one in the plugins window.)
  * preferences: Add the plugin manager as a preferences page.  Refactor to remove unnecessary code and allow the prefs window to open on a particular page.
  * preferences: Use togglebuttons instead of checkbuttons for toolbar button switches, and show the action's icon in the button.
  * nemo-icon-container: Remove some unused code.
  * eel-graphic-effects.c: Lessen the effect eel_create_spotlight_pixbuf.
  * prefs: Restyle the visible buttons page a bit
  * prefs: Move the custom icons to xapps
  * meson_update_icon_cache.py: Print the icon cache folder when running.
  * nemo-widget-menu-item.c: Fix allocation warnings.
  * nemo-extension-config-widget.c: Improve look of extension list.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix a few issues with mounting/ejecting - some incorrect _finish functions and some assumptions of error always being set.
  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Generate large thumnails to accomodate the larger icon sizes we have now.
  * nemo-list-view.c: use the subclass selection changed callback instead of NemoView's directly - this makes sure the cached selection list is up-to-date before triggering view/menu updates.
  * Add some keywords to the desktop entry (#1939)
  * nemo-window-menus.c: Block split pane view in desktop windows.
  * nemo-action.c: g_file_test here should be checking the *dependency* path, not the path to the action file.
  * Preferences: Remove separators
  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Use GTask.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Start using GtkTreeView's fixed height mode.
  * meson.build: Remove gthread dependency (no longer used).
  * nemo-list-model.c: Check for unreadable folders and remove the expander when one is discovered during the async count job.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Don't recalculate the layout while renaming a file.
  * nemo-application.c: Add minimally necessary theme elements to the current theme if they appear to be missing.

  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: Fix warning when initiating a drag from a normal windowed icon view.
  * Remove desktop settings action (replaced by 'Customize' fixed entry).
  * nemo-desktop-window.c: Fix build warning (unused variable).
  * nemo-desktop: Add smaller and larger icon sizes.  The smaller is useful for low res monitors and the larger one will be useful for those using physically large 4k monitors (that do not qualify as hidpi).
  * nemo-properties-window.c: Use XAppIconChooserDialog to select custom icons.
  * Update libxapp dependency for icon chooser.
  * l10n: Update POT and additional files

    provided.
- Rebase nemo-gtk-3.20.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  5 13:05:25 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.8.4:
  * nemo-progress-info.c: Emit signals in proper order to prevent
    an unmatched g_application_hold/release in
    nemo-progress-ui-handler.c.
  * eel-gtk-extensions.c: Use gtk_menu_popup_at_pointer instead of
    plain gtk_menu_popup, which is deprecated (and causes a lot of
    warnings under wayland. Functionality under x11 is unchanged.
  * nemo-file.c: Fix a couple pixbuf leaks, invalidate thumbnails
    internally when a force refresh is commanded.
  * various: Fix some memory leaks.
- Add nemo-gtk-3.20.patch: Restore GTK+ 3.20 support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 16 15:48:41 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.8.3:
  * trash: Show the correct icon in the pathbar, and fix
    activation uri for directories located in the trash.
  * icons: Fix pathbar display of recent and network locations.
  * Run merge_action_strings (updated icons names).
  * nemo-query-editor.c: Ignore modifiers (such as numlock) during
    the favourites menu popup event.
  * nemo-query-editor.c: Use get_default_mod_mask for button state
    check instead of hardcoded mask.
  * mounts: Force reload when navigating to a new mount from the
    sidebar.

  * Change polkit policy message to "Files".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  8 20:40:20 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.8.2:
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix potential divide by 0 (found in
    virtualbox, guest additions CD returns a GFileInfo, but the
    size fields we use for calculating drive full % come back all
    0's).
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix some leaks - GFiles must be
    unreferenced.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Fix list view column ordering in Gtk 3.22.11.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Chain the button release event up when
    ending a rubberband selection. This allows the canvas to "pick"
    the icon the release is over, and not cause the background
    context menu to be used (and all items get deselected) if the
    very next event is a right-click.
  * Make exempi and libexif dependencies optional.
  * Update style of meson build options.
  * Disallow bookmarking of search result views.
  * Add a symbolic icon for usb and replace bookmark-not-found.
  * Fix some compiler warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 30 20:10:22 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.8.1:
  * meson: Don't install libnemo-private.a
  * symbolic control icons: Use icon names rather than gicons.

  * Add mount archive symbolic, fix bookmark icon.
  * mime actions: Fix use of gvfs admin back-end.
  * nemo-view.c: Disallow creation of directories or files in
    admin:// - it does not properly set file permissions (the same
    reason copy/paste is not allowed either.)
  * nemo-file-utilities.c: Improve symbolic icon logic for mounts,
    drives and volumes. For mounts and volumes, check for
    too-generic icons and use the backing GDrive's icon instead.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Handle missing file info more gracefully.
    Some mounted devices (for example, phones,) don't support
    GFileInfo.
  * Fix symbolic for desktop action.
  * Fix build with old meson.
  * Update translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 19 20:07:54 UTC 2018 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.8.0:
  * Switch to Meson.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Add missing position shift
    prior snapping a semi-positioned icon. This was causing the
    free position check to potentially check the wrong grid spot,
    causing shifting positions.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: When calculating drop position, use the overall
    canvas item's y centre, rather than just the icon's centre.
    This is makes the final aligned position more closely match the
    drag actor's apparent position.
  * nemo-desktop-manager: Scale the window x and y positions, as
    well as size when retrieving geometry from cinnamon.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: Fix missing semicolon.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Don't allow the vertical
    adjustment to calculate out to more than half of the grid snap
    height, this will cause grid checks to evaluate incorrectly.
  * nemo-icon-container: Only mark (pseudo)-desktop icons as
    transient if keep_align is active. This restores reasonable
    behaviour for non-keep-aligned desktops, and prevents icon
    movement when refreshing and during startup.
  * Fix left pane in dual pane mode reverting to minimum width.
  * Add g_return_val_if_fail to the beginning of reposition_paned.
  * Rename Nemo icon from places to nemo.
  * nemo-window.c: Listen for a position change on the split-view
    paned widget when adding a new pane. When GtkPaned's position
    property hasn't been explicitly set, it auto-adjusts to keep
    panes equal-sized.
  * nemo-places-sidebar-.c: Get rid of old hack for the sidebar.
    It was intended originally to make sure enough vertical height
    was given to the scrolled container children in their various
    states (collapsed categories). It does not appear to be
    necessary any more, and now causes gtk theme issues.
  * Add options to preview thumbnails for up to 16GB and 32GB.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c, nemo-action.c: Replace
    g_drive_is_media_removable with g_drive_is_removable.
  * nemo-window-slot.c: Remove padding from extra_location_widgets
    box.
  * [gtk3.22] Pathbar style.
  * Use symbolic icons.
  * nemo-window: Check for an active slot when updating cursor.
  * nemo-properties-window: Use utility functions if available.
  * nemo-properties-window: Use gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple().
  * eel-vfs-extensions: Update filename extensions.
  * nemo-places-sidebar: Cleanup spacing.
  * Fix sources: Use other version macro, fix fn call.
  * actions: Fully support all system data paths, but respect the
    install prefix for looking up fixed resources.
  * Fix lmde3 build, don't build empty view by default.
  * Fix thumbmails generation.
  * nemo-file-operations: Revert a change that might be backfiring.
  * nemo-view.c: Don't try to update undo menu items in a
    non-active slot.
  * Fix open as root error.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Don't clear the editable on focus-out, this
    will get done properly when we chain up. We need to propagate
    the focus-out-event signal, which the callback wasn't doing.
  * Don't build/install gtkdocs by default
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: Fix segfault when dragging from nemo to
    nemo-desktop.
  * search: Use newer GtkEntry method for focusing search box,
    remove custom code.
  * nemo-window-menus.c: Ignore "go home" shortcut on the desktop.
  * nemo-view.c: Allow view display of files to commence even when
    loading is ongoing, instead of waiting until files are entirely
    finished loading.
  * eel-editable-label.c: Don't queue a redraw on unrealised labels.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Don't perform relayouts on an unrealised
    container.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Remove and re-add columns rather than moving
    them. This prevents negative allocation warnings during the
    move calls.
  * eel-canvas.c: Don't update the scroll region when clearing the
    canvas to destroy it.
  * query editor: Simplify, remove additional filters, just a
    simple filename search.
  * nemo-window.c: Go back to explicitly setting half the width for
    the split-pane's position property, rather than counting on it
    to fall that way naturally.  The natural position can be
    affected by sizing demands of the panes' children.
  * search: Add a more convenient way for saving searches.
  * nemo-file.c: Avoid recursion when updating symbolic links that
    point to each other. See inline notes.
  * nemo-file.c: Small fix and optimisation for 40dc6ae - return
    the full link_file list as before if the target file is not a
    link, and only check if the file is a link one time.
  * libnemo-extension: Remove custom enum code for
    NemoOperationResult - it's not necessary in modern builds due
    to introspection.
  * info provider extensions: Improvements to info provider
    extension operations.
  * nemo-query-editor.c: Add mnemonic to popup search keys for
    quick selection.
  * nemo-query-editor.c: Inhibit faves popup if the list is empty,
    filter out typical keyboard modifiers during clicks on the
    favourite icon.
  * nemo-desktop-application.c: Allow nemo-desktop to provide
    coverage for the org.freedesktop.FileManager1 D-Bus interface.
  * nemo-icon-view.c: Be more selective when updating the scroll
    region.
  * refresh/reload: When reacting to a user-initiated view refresh,
    regenerate any thumbnails as well.
  * nemo-properties-window: Stop using stock buttons.
  * prefs-window: Don't use stock buttons.
  * menus: Convert most icons to symbolic versions.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Re-apply right-click column handler when
    reloading column settings (see inline notes, this only affects
    certain Gtk versions.
  * nemo-view.c: Add label to directory menu Cut and Copy.
  * nemo-view.c: make mnemonics for Cut, Copy, Paste match Gtk's.
  * Fix function argument order.
  * Check for realized instead of mapped/visible to prevent
    needless resize calculations (and associated warnings).
  * nemo-file-management-properties: Fix 2px border width
    surrounding content (see comments).
  * Use symbolic icons for the places sidebar.
  * places-sidebar.c: Use symbolic for eject button.
  * More symbolic conversion.
  * nemo-trash-monitor.c: Add a new path for the symbolic icon.
    Our file views need a non-symbolic icon.
  * More symbolic fixes, cleanup in pathbar.
  * Missed a few trash icons.
  * extensions: Show symbolic icons properly, hide the icon if it
    is not a symbolic name.
  * Add rubber-band selection to the list view.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Remove vertical padding for headers.
    This is unnecessary, and looks bad when a theme has increased
    spacing between all rows.
  * go menu, bookmarks menu: Respect the menu-images setting.
  * nemo-trash-monitor.c: Fix a copy-paste typo.
  * nemo-icon-info.c: Stop using gtk_icon_theme_has_icon() - it
    returns false negative when attempting to check for icons that
    have been added using gtk_icon_theme_append_search_path().
    This entire branch of functionality is considered "legacy" and
    not recommended, but for dropbox emblems, where more than one
    package may attempt to provide them, putting them in the
    (recommended) hicolor icon folder won't work.
  * Use media-mount icon for right-click action.
  * Eject/unmount icon & new directory icon.
  * Force UTF-8 to workaround build error.
  * Fix some warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec 24 10:19:44 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.5:
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Add null checks for GErrors - it seems
    as though g_dbus calls are not guaranteed to fill the error
    slot.
  * nemo-window: Restore inadvertantly removed menu actions for
    view type selection (and their corresponding shortcuts), using
    methods and practices more consistent with currently maintained
    code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 21 07:11:21 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.4:
  * nemo-window: Restore initial synchronisation of view buttons.
    This was inadvertantly removed in d237626 when getting rid of
    some actual unused code related to an old way view types used
    to be selected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 18 00:00:12 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.3:
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Account for scale factor when using
    cinnamon- supplied monitor info. Cinnamon runs at a scale
    factor of 1 always, and things are scaled internally.
  * dnd: Make sure to clear any source_fs pointers after dnd
    operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov 12 21:00:18 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Remove the cinnamon-translations build requirement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 28 19:57:36 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.6.2 (changes since 3.4.7):
  * actions: Escape single and double quotes that are part of a
    file path. Add a "Terminal" key in the nemo_action file, to
    execute the Exec line in a terminal window.
  * actions: Update sample action for Terminal keyword, update
    nemo_action sourceview files.
  * actions: Only use nemo_launch_application_from_command_array()
    when Terminal=true. This ensures compatibility with existing
    actions, which will continue to use g_spawn_async().
  * nemo-icon-info.h: Use standard icon sizes for the desktop.
  * nemo-action.c: Fixup a few compiler warnings.
  * nemo-icon-private.h: Avoid memory padding. Save a little memory
    use by rearranging the fields to avoid memory padding in
    structures.
  * eel-editable-label.h: Avoid memory padding. Move fields in a
    structure to avoid memory padding made padding explicit to
    avoid warning messages if the padding compiler warnings are on.
  * nemo-file-undo-operations.c: Use GQueue instead of GList for
    our undo file pair lists.
  * nemo-file-operations.c: Use g_remove for native (path-reachable)
    files. Allowing the normal g_file_delete involves gvfs whether
    the file is native or not.
  * nemo.desktop: Remove DBusActivatable line - we don't actually
    support it yet, it was an unnecessary change in ad5fcfc.
    This ends up just causing issues with getting nemo to launch in
    more up-to-date distributions.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Always treat desktop pseudo-files as
    semi-placed icons - that is, they can have their positions
    stored, then restored later, but their position can be adjusted
    upon placement if their previously stored position is now
    occupied.
  * nemo-progress-ui-handler.c: Use XAppGtkWindow for the progress
    window, so we can pass progress info to Cinnamon.
  * nemo-desktop-manager: Refactor and expand to integrate better
    with Cinnamon.
  * plugin manager: Allow launching of an extension's config
    application from the plugin window, rather than having it in
    the main menu.
  * desktop: Handle blank desktop windows properly during monitor
    change events.
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Don't just try to resize existing
    desktops if the number of monitors has changed. In this case,
    do a full re-layout.
  * nemo-progress-ui-handler.c: Don't update the status icon if
    it's not being shown.
  * nemo-file-operations.c: Reduce progress ui update frequency
    during file operations.
  * Fix some warnings in libnemo-private
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Don't run on_run_state_changed() during
    the init phase when it's a fallback session as it can cause a
    nasty recursion problem resulting in a crash.
  * nemo-directory-async.c: Hold the directory alive for the
    duration of an extension provider job, to ensure clean
    termination to the job when asynchronous info providers are
    used.
  * dbus services: Normalise file names.
  * desktop: Don't show the "Show hidden files" menu item. We have
    never show hidden files on the desktop, so having this is
    misleading.
  * Add .rar and .7z to the archive mounting action.
  * When activating files on the desktop (only), deselect them
    after activating them.
  * nemo-toolbar.c: Add an option to hide an elevated privileges
    warning.
  * Rename show-superuser-toolbar to show-root-warning.
  * file: Let renames work on Google Drive Renaming. An item on
    Google Drive does not change the actual GVfs path because the
    path is made up of document-ids, which do not change.
    A rename operation only affects the title of the entry.
    In GIO terms, only the standard::display-name changes, but the
    standard::name remains the same.
  * file, file-undo-operations: Let renames on Google Drive be
    undone. We really should be using standard::display-name when
    renaming files - g_file_get_basename is simply not the right
    thing to use. Moreover, in case of Google Drive, the URI might
    not change with the display name and we can not get the old
    display name from the old GFile.
  * A send by mail action.
  * Fix permissions on files/usr/share/nemo/actions/send-by-mail.py
  * Update the man page.
  * Update translations.
- Remove nemo-implicit-pointer-decl.patch,
  nemo-void-return-no-return.patch: merged upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 20 16:09:40 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.7:
  * eel_g_list_str_copy: Replace contents with g_list_copy_deep.
    May improve performance somewhat for very high volume file
    copies (lp#1663186).
  * nemo-main-application.c: Try to start as a service first, then
    a client. This allows nemo to be started via dbus (which
    requires it be run with the G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag) as
    well as being able to connect to an already-running instance as
    we can now.
  * nemo-main-application.c: Re-add "no-desktop" command line
    option. We don't use it anymore, but some programs apparently
    hardcode nemo with this flag rather than use xdg-open or
    mimetype activation. This allows them to continue working as
    before.
  * nemo-view.c: Fix "follow link to original file" action when the
    link is on the desktop. In these cases, we need to launch a
    directory handler and pass it the full file name (which for
    most file managers should open the folder and select the file).
  * nemo-query-editor.c: Use a copy of the query text to check if
    the query is empty (or all spaces). The function g_strstrip
    modifies the string in-place, and passing the modified query
    text causes issues when typing multiple words (separated by
    spaces) in the query.
  * Configure: Disable a tracker by default.
  * nemo-desktop-icon-grid-view.c: Store layout timestamps any
    time the layout is changed by a user action.
  * Desktop: Remove metadata for pseudo-files on the desktop such
    as Computer and Home when they're removed via preferences.
    This simulates their deletion with respect to how metadata
    timestamps are tracked and validated.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Mark the sort as dirty any
    time a file is added or removed (this determines whether and
    when the sort direction indicator is shown in the context menu
    when auto-arrange is not active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  9 12:20:12 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.6:
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Reset lazy flag when the icon
    position is stored in auto-layout mode.
  * nemo-file.c: Don't check for valid thumbnails if thumbnailing
    is disabled.
  * nemo-action.c: Use non-blocking checks for a directory.
  * css: Treat NemoBlankDesktopWindow the same as NemoDesktopWindow
    with regards to themes, add a couple fixes to our application
    css to prevent background issues with certain themes
    (BlackMATE, Ambiance).
  * move-to/copy-to dialogs: Allow remote locations in the sidebar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 28 19:20:44 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.5:
  * search (ctrl-f): Don't search for an empty string.
    If the user wants to search for every file, one can use the
    wildcard (*).
  * nemo-application: Only check/create the config directory at
    startup for nemo, and have nemo-desktop check both config and
    Desktop directories.
  * nemo-window-menus.c: Fix control-n (new window) action callback
    when used from the desktop process - it should launch the
    preferred file manager instead of attempting to spawn a window
    itself.
  * configure.ac: Suppress deprecated warnings.
  * Add --enable-silent-rules to debian/rules, quiet C89 warnings.
  * l10n: Generate desktop files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jun 26 08:54:15 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.4:
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Skip default placement if we
    are in auto-layout mode. We get false lazy flags on new icons
    since the original desktop did not use auto-layout. We need to
    handle this because we both store layout timestamps and provide
    auto-layout.
  * nemo-window-slot.c: Initialise cache_bar to NULL, this is
    checked for in nemo-window-manage-views
    (nemo_window_slot_check_bad_cache_bar).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 21 16:11:48 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.3:
  * Remove decoration from desktop window (shows in weston).
  * Desktop: Relax control of positioning for placed icons.
    At startup, they are loaded and set to their stored position,
    but not force-aligned, allowing the layout to ignore
    fluctuations in the work area during system startup.
    Fix some logic around "orphan" icons as well to prevent issues
    with icons not being shown due to being falsely classified as
    orphans.
  * icon container: Be more specific about when to flag icons
    coming from a different monitor due to a desktop configuration
    change.
  * metadata: Add back cached position values in NemoFile.
    Be sure to clear the timestamp metadata on files being
    moved/copied to or from the desktop. This ensures the lazy flag
    operates correctly. With the desktop becoming a separate
    process, transfers that include position info need to be
    handled slightly differently, as the old way of just setting
    metadata and reacting to it from a new container won't work -
    the file gets debuted in the other process sooner than (or not
    reliably after, at least) the metadata is written, resulting in
    inconsistent positioning.
  * Add gvfs-info action for inspecting file metadata (for purposes
    of debugging) - right-click a file and it will send gvfs-info
    output on that file to stdout.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Improve updates after
    thumbnail generation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 24 14:40:01 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.2:
  * nemo-icon-container.c: don't force a native window for the
    desktop - fixes prelight hover sticking on the desktop when
    leaving an icon to pass into another window.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container: Don't show bracketed empty
    spots, it's tacky.
  * nemo-main.c: Remove back end requirement (only needed for the
    desktop).
  * icon view/desktop: Fix hidpi scaling on the desktop.
    This also fixes compact view mode in hidpi, which was
    semi-broken since hidpi was implemented, and very broken since
    the desktop grid was added.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: Depopulate the dnd grid of the selected icons
    so insertion marks aren't drawn in the icon's source position.
  * nemo-window-manager-views.c: Simply close the window if the
    current view has no backward history, instead of jumping home
    or to the parent directory. The most common time for this to
    occur is a directory opened from the desktop - if you delete
    that directory, the window showing it then shows the desktop in
    a directory, which doesn't make much sense.
  * nemo-window-manage-views.c: Invalidate file info before
    reloading the view, not after.
    This fixes mount permissions being incorrect.
  * dnd: Restore capability of "moving" files from and to the
    desktop via drag'n'drop.
  * Fetch file-roller mimetype info from a GDesktopAppInfo at
    startup, instead of a static (and woefully out of date) list.
  * nemo-file.c: Add EFAULT as a valid exception to the access_ok
    function. This can throw when the file has just been moved or
    is in the midst of being moved and the internal asynch updates
    have not completed yet (usually during a fairly large transfer).
    As a result, the icon cache problem bar appears needlessly.
  * desktop: Size thumbnails more appropriately - scale them to our
    icon size in height only, and allow the width to increase as
    much as our max text width while maintaining the image aspect
    ratio.
  * desktop thumbnails: Pad the thumbnail height when it ends up
    smaller than the desired height due to aspect ratio and width
    restrictions.
    This ensures a nice alignment when keep-aligned is active.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Highlight the current dnd
    rectangle in debug mode.
  * desktop grid: Use the layout size for determining constraint to
    the canvas bounds instead of max size - this prevents files
    with very long names from being pushed out of the grid alignment.
  * misc: Clean up minor leaks, other issues.
  * desktop grid: Include additional text (Icon Captions) in
    calculations for the ellipsis limit, and update the desktop
    when these change - instead of forcing the user to reload or
    restart to see changes.
  * nemo-style-application: Remove drop shadow from the selection
    and pre-light states of desktop icons. The shadows are drawn
    outside the calculated bounds of these items, and are
    problematic to account for without doing frequent full screen
    repaints.
  * DnD: Draw the highlight box around the entire text when an item
    is prelit and highlighted as a drop target. The highlight box
    was only drawing as if to surround only the normal, ellipsised
    text, rather than the full, unellipsised height.
  * Set a default font for the desktop - this is overridden by
    distributions in most cases, but having something is better
    than leaving it blank - you could set it to "Foo Sans 15"
    and it would still show the labels, even though you lack that
    actual font.
  * Add a default to our theme - Using the default font was always
    supposed to be a fallback option, however the check in various
    places for whether the gsettings key is empty or not is incorrect:
    GSettings::get_string() will always return a string, never
    NULL, so we need to check if the string is not empty instead
    (boo#1040024).
  * desktop: Fix missing icons when "show orphans" is disabled
    (we were incorrectly interpreting a monitor number of -1 (which
    means, no previous location) and a missing monitor).
  * Fix visual sort function - sort function was incorrect for the
    new grid, and the new order was never set after a sort when
    running the alignment routine.
  * nemo-places-sidebar: Use folder-recents for the recent icon.
  * grid view: Don't re-enable auto-arrange when changing zoom
    levels.
  * Desktop dnd - Use more sensible behaviour when keep-aligned is
    active.
  * Fix dnd for netscape url drops.
  * nemo-mime-actions.c: Don't fail for non-local links (like
    dragged website links) - the check here is for the foreign url,
    not the local desktop file (link), so it will never succeed,
    and is not necessary.
  * DnD: Fix some positioning issues with auto-align local moves,
    and non-local icon moves (like nemo->nemo-desktop transfers).
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Keep the icon list synched
    with the visual order of the desktop.
  * dnd: Split out some container-specific code that had bled over a
    bit.
  * Modify desktop icon order.
  * nemo-file-operations.c: store the desktop location during a
    duplicate job, to fix DnD duplicate positioning on the desktop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May  7 11:23:03 UTC 2017 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.4.1 (changes since 3.2.2):
  * Nemo-Icon-View: Fix missing cast warning.
  * restore prototype lost in Nemo 3.2.0.
  * Add a missing include.

  * Use 24-hour date format when requested.
  * Translate date formats.
  * nautilus-file: Implement smarter dates.
  * nautilus-list-view: Add a modified column with time.
  * nautilus-file: Clarify translators comments.
  * nautilus-file: Fix a memory leak.
  * nautilus-file: Fix code style.
  * Mark time format with xgettext:no-c-format.
  * file: Fix date string day difference calculation.
  * Use long day and month names if space allows.
  * Make libselinux dependency controllable by configure switch.
  * Raise tracker version.
  * autogen.sh: Don't run aclocal.
  * location-bar: Use a GFile in location-changed signal.
  * l10n: Generate desktop file via generate_aditional_file.
  * Add Cinnamon panel shortcuts (trash, computer, etc.) to the
    launcher.
  * Fix compiler warnings in the eel/ directory.
  * nemo-desktop-window, nemo-blank-desktop-window: Clean
    delete-event handling up.
  * window: Make NemoWindow a GtkApplicationWindow.
  * nemo-file-operations.c: Use only template filenames for new
    files.
  * nemo-navigation-action.c: Add new_tab_action.
  * configure.ac: Remove CFLAGS line - the optimisation is
    dangerous, and the fatal warnings for unused stuff was just
    annoying when trying to refactor - warnings are enough.
  * Use GTimer for tracking startup speed, and also use one to
    track view loads.
  * nemo-view.c: Add idle timer for benchmarking.
  * Split off desktop handling into new process.
  * Split off old icon container into the existing subclass
    NemoIconViewContainer and set up a new subclass -
    NemoIconViewGridContainer to match with a new
    NemoDesktopIconGridView class. The old style is accessible via
    the org.nemo.desktop 'use-desktop-grid' setting.
  * Fix autostart file name so cinnamon session doesn't fail.
  * Remove a bunch of comments, fix auto-layout not sticking.
  * nemo-icon-container: Move debug drawing to the grid container
    subclass. Trigger it using NEMO_DEBUG=Desktop when running
    nemo-desktop.
  * Implement horizontal layout.
  * General fixes, icons, metadata issues between monitors. Provide
    per-monitor metadata for desktop containers.
  * Improve DND during keep-aligned, allow for insertion of items.
    Implement zoom scaling and allow adjustment.
  * Improve highlighting of hovered items
  * Fix desktop folder launching - xdg-open was never intended to be
    the final answer.
  * Fix ellipses change listening - the is_desktop flag was being
    set too late in the view construction process to connect to the
    correct gsettings key.
  * Fix regression causing metadata to be inconsistent in nemo
    client window when navigating to and away from the Desktop
    directory.
  * Add some gsettings listeners for grid stuff.
  * Fix dnd between monitors - clamp grid values, and ensure we
    have a grid on the target monitor.
  * Fix zoom switching, dnd placement, snapping.
  * nemo-desktop-utils.c: Improve how we store the monitor number
    for a desktop window.
  * Use black instead of theme colour for pre-light label
    highlighting.
  * nemo-icon-canvas-item.c: Extend redraw area slightly for canvas
    items. This ensures any small shadow we have is cleaned up
    after an item is de-selected.
  * nemo-desktop-icon-grid-view.c: Don't trigger a real update
    while updating menus.
  * Disable zoom for the desktop window (allow it only via context
    menu).
  * nemo-desktop-application: Clean some commented lines up.
  * Fix desktop file error (gh#linuxmint#nemo#1477).
  * nemo-navigation-action.c: Extend, Fix Middle-Click
    (gh#linuxmint#nemo#1478).
  * l10n: Update POT file.
- Rebase nemo-void-return-no-return.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 15 19:24:15 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.2.2 (changes since 3.2.0):
  * Add missing "Desktop" DEBUG flag.
  * Add space to Name[en_GB].
  * file-operations: Don't recurse for trash operations.
  * Force X11 backend.
  * Remove screen metadata (we only ever have one screen).
  * nemo-file-operations.c: Don't update position metadata on most
    file operations - it's costly, and can cause lockups.
  * l10n: Generate additional files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov  8 13:01:41 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.2.0:
  * Migrate away from gnome-common deprecated vars and macros.
  * Fix GCC pointer signedness warnings.
  * Add a .view style class on the icon view scrolled window.
  * window: Remove a custom get_preferred_width/height implementation.
    We already take care of the default size when we create the
    window, and these only break assumptions of the default
    GtkWindow's handlers.
  * pathbar: Avoid GTK+ warnings.
  * pathbar: Remove a hardcoded width for sliders.
  * Close an open_as_root child on child exit.
  * nemo-context-menu-menu-item.c: Use correct grammar in the
    context menu toggle.
  * Fix a GTK+ 3.21.3+ desktop redraw issue (gh#linuxmint/nemo#1231).
  * Replace a deprecated gtk_icon_info_free() with g_object_unref().
  * file-operations: Reduce the time for reliable transfer rate.
  * Remove a 'Show text in icon' preference.
  * nemo-view.c: Unescape uris being passed to file-roller during
    drag-and-drop (replaces %20 with spaces).
  * Expand grid width to canvas.
  * Minimum of one column.
  * Update nemo-file.c.
  * trash-monitor: Change trash monitoring process.
  * Fix --geometry option when Nemo is already running.
  * Keep warnings as warnings when building the packages.
  * nemo-window.c: Save sidebar width 100ms after last change.
  * nemo-application.c: Fix maximised window state preservation.
  * Remove conditional ellipsis code for GTK+ < 3.12.0 builds.
  * Bind double left click on blank to go to parent directory.
  * Add an option to manage double cick in blank area (off by
    default) because it changes previous behaviour.
  * nemo-file.c: Only append .desktop to desktop files when they
    actually need it. Trusted desktop files (ones that typically
    get made and placed on the desktop) don't show their extension,
    so when you try to rename them, the new name needs .desktop
    appended to it.
  * nemo-file-management-properties.glade: Improve the description
    of the click-to-rename feature.
  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Don't set a stack size.
  * nemo-application.c: Look for already-existing desktop windows
    before attempting to manage the desktop.
  * desktop: Don't rebuild the desktop any time _NET_WORKAREA
    changes - this can happen fairly frequently in some situations,
    causing crashes due to the asynchronous nature of nemo's
     directory loading back-end.
  * eel-gnome-extensions.c: Use preferred terminal emulator when
    using "Run in terminal" to execute something.
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Run layout_changed when the widget
    scale factor changes.
  * file-undo-operations: Change trashed files matching condition.
  * icon view: Use the correct container size for applying margins
    to the icon container. Also, make sure icon data is fully
    loaded before positioning items - desktop pseudo-items don't
    necessarily have the correct bounding boxes defined by the time
    layout occurs. Load this data just before trying to position
    the icon, rather than just after.
  * nemo-desktop-utils: Adjustments for Gtk 3.22 changes in monitor
    management. gdk_screen_get_monitor_workarea() no longer returns
    a valid workarea, it simply returns the geometry.
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: Reload the desktop in an idle callback.
  * nemo-application.c: Add a whitelist for ignoring existing
    desktop handlers by WM_CLASS match. By default 'conky' is in
    the list.
- Remove nemo-fix-desktop-redraw.patch: fixed upstream.
- Move gtk-doc to the devel package.
- Update nemo-implicit-pointer-decl.patch and
  nemo-void-return-no-return.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 27 12:38:17 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Add nemo-fix-desktop-redraw.patch from upstream commit 4e5a103:
  fix a GTK+ 3.21.3+ desktop (boo#1001431, gh#linuxmint/nemo#1231).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 23 18:43:19 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.6:
  * Generate action files manually (as opposed to during the build).
  * nemo-desktop-utils.c: return 0 for monitor index if a widget
    isn't realised (this can happen during configuration changes
    and during session startup).
  * nemo-desktop-icon-view.c: Disconnect from the same gsettings
    instance we connected to.
  * nemo-desktop-manager, nemo-application: Fix some cleanup
    issues - disconnect from the correct objects when disposing of
    the desktop manager, and destroy the desktop manager earlier
    in Nemo's destruction so there are no issues freeing the
    DesktopInfos.
  * notebook: Remove unused ifdef code.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Detach the column header menu from metadata
    when setting it up. Use the actual view's layout instead. When
    reacting to visible columns being changed, simplify things by
    iterating through the treeview column to build a new metadata
    list.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Don't show trash-specific columns in the
    header menu.
  * list view: Make changes to the search results view persistent.
    gvfs can't save metadata for the search 'folder' so we store it
    ourselves.
  * eel-canvas.c: Fix touchscreen selection in icon views.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  1 12:43:15 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.5 (changes since 3.0.3):
  * Add standard settings for EelEditableLabel.
  * Build-require cinnamon-translations.
  * Use g_hash_table_remove_all and get rid of some callbacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 16:25:54 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.3:
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: When gtk overlay scrolling is in effect,
    add some padding right of the sidebar eject icons, otherwise
    they are covered by the scrollbar when it pops up.
  * Update pot file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 21 13:21:24 UTC 2016 - mailaender@opensuse.org

- Update to version 3.0.2:
  * Fix build.
  * Fix action i18n scripts to write UTF-8.
  * nemo-icon-view: Include nemo-application.h needed in
    nemo_icon_view_add_file for: nemo_application_set_cache_flag,
    nemo_application_get_singleton.
  * nemo-pathbar: Use gint for slider_width instead of gint16
    silences an incorrect pointer type warning.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Don't explicitly unref columns anymore –
    they'll get handled when the tree view is destroyed.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Re-enable desktop type-to-select feature.
    Also make a couple fixes on the positioning logic for this
    little popup. Where possible, it will avoid overlapping panels.
  * desktop windows: Maximise instead of relying on gdk for monitor
    workarea – it's inaccurate for anything but the primary monitor.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Special case desktop windows for search
    popup – now that we can rely on the window being the correct
    size to account for panels, we can reliably position this popup
    off of those panels.
  * prefs: Don't try to hardcode a minimum size for the
    preferences dialog.
  * Use g_themed_icon_new instead of
    g_themed_icon_new_with_default_fallbacks.
  * nemo-window.c: As of 9cb9c48 we maximise the desktop
    containers to make sure they use the correct work area as set
    by muffin. This started causing the window state 'maximized'
    key to be set to true when opening a new nemo window.
    This corrects that issue, using disable_chrome as an indicator
    to ignore the window – only the desktop windows set this true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 12 09:54:43 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.1:
  * pathbar: Always show the pathbar up and down arrows.
    Dynamically adding and removing these buttons was causing the
    visual style of buttons in the pathbar to break.
  * Fix segfault on changing the number of colums when in list view.
  * Fix uninitialised is_desktop flag.
  * Port Python scripts to Python 3.x: /data/extract_action_strings,
    /data/merge_action_strings,
    /files/usr/share/nemo/actions/myaction.py.
  * nemo-list-view.c:  Fix initial column sizing: expand the
    filename column only to fill available space.
    Other columns will start with their natural size.
  * nemo-view: Switch to nemo_get_file_by_uri so we don't get a null
    pointer if the file isn't already loaded internally.
  * Add desktop settings action.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Ensure a minimum usable sidebar width
    when resizing windows or panes.
  * Set minimum size for File Management Preferences window.
  * Increase default width of File Management Preferences window.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Clean up column changes: only add columns and
    connect to them once, remove some unnecessary checks.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Give the name column a default width that
    the column-double-click autosize action can use. Otherwise it
    makes the name column as small as possible (the opposite what
    it's supposed to do, or what the other columns do).
  * Update m4 files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 25 05:00:35 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 3.0.0:

  * Respect dbus_satisfied flag for menu enties on blank desktops.
  * Fix printf format specifier.
  * Don't draw the desktop on a cloned monitor.
  * Fix some missing cast warnings.
  * Fix fallback style for GTK 3.20+.
  * Add style class nemo-window-pane.
  * Add style class nemo-properties-dialog to GtkBuilder file.
  * Add style class in nemo_desktop_window_init (same as Nautilus).
  * Add style class to places sidebar.
  * Add style class to nemo-window.
  * Use a more specific class name for places sidebar.
  * nemo-icon-info.c: Remove invalid
    GTK_ICON_LOOKUP_GENERIC_FALLBACK flag (triggers warnings in
    Gtk 3.20+).
  * nemo-window: Add new flag NEMO_WINDOW_OPEN_FLAG_SEARCH and use
    the same slot if this flag is passed to
    nemo_window_slot_open_location_full to avoid opening a new
    window (and a crash) when starting a search with the open in
    new window preference enabled.
  * Updated makepot and pot file.
- Rebase nemo-void-return-no-return.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  9 18:09:32 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.7:
  * Improve context menu toggle:
    - shows separate distinct regions of the menu item now;
    - tooltip manifests as right-justified text next to the toggle
      icon.
  * Use g_strcmp0 instead of unsafe strcmp.
  * file: Don't crash when the original file path has reserved
    characters.
  * file-operations: Make sure to use correct filename when
    restoring from Trash.
  * file-utils: Ensure directories exist before restoring from trash.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 27 11:09:29 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.6:
  * nemo-view.c: Fix Open context menu entry not updating its label
    when a new selection is made. Also, fix tracking the context
    toggle when the menu has scroll bars.
  * nemo-view: Fix invalid View reference when view types change,
    and the tooltip is updated for the context menu toggle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 20 19:24:16 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.5:
  * list view, icon view: Do not trigger click-on-rename until
    button release, in order to preserve the possibility of
    dragging an already-selected single item.
  * icon-view/container: Fix click-to-rename issue where selection
    count was not up-to-date, requiring an extra click to trigger
    a rename after selecting a single icon from having no selection
    previously.
  * bookmarks: Fix crashing and inconsistent behaviour when
    working with remote bookmarks.
  * nemo-icon-container: Prevent interactive search on the desktop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 12 10:21:31 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.4:
  * nemo-file-operations.c: Handle NULL NemoFiles when deciding
    queue: this happens in both directions when dragging/copying
    files to and from a Virtualbox guest or host.
  * Removed context menu option from preferences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov 11 21:01:32 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  9 10:53:15 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.2:
  * file operations queue: Refactor slightly to make it easier to
    manage what gets queued and what gets started immediately.
  * nemo-window-pane.c: Prevent search from appearing on desktop.
  * preferences: Move context menu toggle to the top of the
    Display page.
  * file operations window: Raise the window when another operation
    is added, if the window is visible (not status-iconed).
  * click-to-rename: move logic to earlier in the click event, in a
    way similar to how double-clicks are handled. Also, handle the
    preference change in nemo-view – this way it can be re-used
    later to handle list views as well. Also, this keeps us from
    interacting with GSettings so much.
  * icon view: Fetch click-to-rename preference when the view is
    loaded, do not allow click-to-rename on read-only files.
  * thumbnails: Detect and throttle back thumbnail generation for
    files that are being actively updated on disk.
  * file queue: Add some additional checks for determining whether
    or not to start a file operation immediately.
  * Add option to disable queueing.
  * job queue: Refactor to reduce duplication, add debugging info,
    add filesystem comparison to detect false "local" paths (local
    paths to non-local or non-native filesystems and mounts).
  * nemo-query-editor: Fix some casts to prevent build warnings.
  * click-to-rename: Fix accidental rename triggering with multiple
    selection in icon view
  * click-to-rename: Fix previous commit (broke double-click upon
    initial selection.)
  * list view: Do not clear the rename widget twice.
  * Fixed Nemo crashing when quickly clicking on two unmounted
    volumes in the sidebar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 27 11:21:31 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.1:
  * nemo-list-view.c: Fix editable not being destroyed after a
    canceled rename in certain instances. This would cause the
    action bindings for cut/copy not to be released from the text
    entry box, breaking cut/copy/paste until Nemo is restarted.
  * src/nemo-extension-config-widget.c: Make "No extensions found"
    un-clickable like the other two lists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 14:05:01 UTC 2015 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to 2.8.0:

    script path.
  * Use definitions from nemo-global-preferences.
  * Move action key definition to nemo-action.h to be external
    usable.
  * Show comment as tooltips for actions in action config, and
    improve comments for some actions.
  * Remove nemo_window_slot_go_to().
  * Combine the search bar and query editor.
  * Add search_is_not_empty, to fixe a segfault in treelist.
  * Only include the domain if the method is SMB.
  * Bump some deps and build-deps.
  * Quick rename.
  * Fix default sort order bug in list view.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix a couple of drag-and-drop issues
    when there are no bookmarks, or when the xdg-bookmark area is
    empty.
  * nemo-places-sidebar.c: Fix a memory leak.
  * connect-to-server: Remember the last connection type.
  * nemo-list-view.c: Fix column sorting when default sort type is
    "Detailed type".
  * nemo-connect-server-dialog.c: Fix previous commit.
  * Fix build warnings, missing prototype.
  * nemo-window-pane.c: Fix crash during location entry.
  * Fix indentation.
  * Don't assign the position of the last closed window to the
    first opened window (it would be really confusing if it worked…
    and it didn't really work since gtk_application_get_windows()
    seemed to also count the desktop window).
  * Prefs: Rephrase quickrename option.
  * nemo-action-config-widget.c: Localise non-localised comment
    strings.
  * Update pot file.
  * Re-add revealer animation on search bar.
  * Fix Query Editor Row not displaying.
