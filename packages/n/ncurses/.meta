  <title>New curses Libraries</title>
  <description>As soon as a text application needs to directly control its output to
the screen (if it wants to place the cursor at location (x,y) then
write text), ncurses is used. The panel and the forms libraries are
included in this package. These new libraries support color, special
characters, and panels.</description>
