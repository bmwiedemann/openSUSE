    <comment>NetHack is one of the classic games on Unix. I updated the orphaned package games:nethack to build again and it cleaned up overall. I'd like to have it added to openSUSE:Factory to make it available in our distributions. Devel project will be games:nethack.</comment>

    <comment>- Mark NetHack's record and logfile file with %config(noreplace), so
  that package updates do not overwrite existing highscores and
  information about previous games. Also list the various state files
  individually instead of lumping them together.
- Install 'logfile' instead of 'log' in NetHack's state directory. The
  file contains information about earlier played games.
- Avoid race around dlb.o (boo#1102408)
