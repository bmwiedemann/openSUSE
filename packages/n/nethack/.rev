    <comment>NetHack is one of the classic games on Unix. I updated the orphaned package games:nethack to build again and it cleaned up overall. I'd like to have it added to openSUSE:Factory to make it available in our distributions. Devel project will be games:nethack.</comment>

    <comment>- Mark NetHack's record and logfile file with %config(noreplace), so
  that package updates do not overwrite existing highscores and
  information about previous games. Also list the various state files
  individually instead of lumping them together.
- Install 'logfile' instead of 'log' in NetHack's state directory. The
  file contains information about earlier played games.
- Avoid race around dlb.o (boo#1102408)

    <comment>- Add nethack-escape-char.patch: Split off from nethack-misc.patch,
  this patch contains a fix for input handling.
- Add nethack-secure.patch: Improve support for SECURE in recover
  utility. Does not affect the game binary. Taken from nethack-misc.patch.
- Modify nethack-config.patch: When patching Makefiles, also fix the
  paths in the documentation to match openSUSE systems.
- Drop nethack-misc.patch: The patch has been split and its content
  moved to other patch files.
- Modify nethack-gzip.patch: Point COMPRESS to /usr/bin/gzip and avoid
  the symlink /bin. The top-level /bin directory is supposed to go away.
- Modify nethack-config.patch: The patch enabled building a number of
  files for X11, which we don't support. Remove them from the build.
- Drop nethack-syscall.patch: The patch only affects builds with GNOME
  support, which we don't do.
- Add nethack-reproducible.patch: Same as reproducible.patch, but
  follows patch-nameing conventions. There's now also a short patch
  description in the spec file.
- Drop reproducible.patch: Renamed to nethack-reproducible.patch.
- Modify nethack-syscall.patch: Refresh to account for offset changes.
- Modify nethack-gzip.patch: Refresh to account for offset changes.
- Modify nethack-config: Enable panic logging. This records serious
  errors in the file panic log in the game's state directory. Helps
  with debugging.

    <comment>- Add an interesting and meaningful description to the package.
- Clarify package summary.
- Link to HTTPS URL.
- Filter no-%check-section rpmlint warnings. There are no test cases
  for NetHack. (W: no-%check-section)
- Filter zero-length rpmlint warnings. Several files are required to
  by empty. Filter them from the RPM linter. (E: zero-length)
- Do not install documentation files. We package these files from the
  dource directory No need to copy them into the build root.
- Set file attributes in %files section. It is not possible to use
  'make install' for this package, so we have to install all files
  manually. Resolve the hodgepotch of install and %attr commands by
  setting all file attributes in the %files section.
- Do not install /etc/nethack directory. We do not packaged it and it
  does not contain any files.
