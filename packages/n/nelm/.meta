  <title>Nelm is a Helm 3 alternative</title>
  <description>**Nelm** is a Helm 3 alternative. It is a Kubernetes deployment tool that manages Helm Charts and deploys them to Kubernetes and also is the deployment engine of [werf](https://github.com/werf/werf). It can do (almost) everything that Helm does, but better, and even quite some on top of it. Nelm is based on improved and partially rewritten Helm 3 codebase, to introduce:

* `terraform plan`-like capabilities;
* replacement of 3-Way Merge with Server-Side Apply;
* secrets management;
* advanced resource ordering capabilities;
* improved resource state/error tracking;
* continuous printing of logs, events, resource statuses and errors during deploy;
* lots of fixes for Helm 3 bugs, e.g. [&quot;no matches for kind Deployment in version apps/v1beta1&quot;](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/7219);
* ... and more.</description>
