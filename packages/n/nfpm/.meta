  <description>nFPM is a simple and 0-dependencies deb, rpm, apk and arch linux packager written in Go

## Why

While fpm is great, for me, it is a bummer that it depends on ruby, tar and other software.

I wanted something that could be used as a binary and/or as a library and that was really simple.

So I created nFPM: a simpler, 0-dependency, as-little-assumptions-as-possible alternative to fpm.</description>
