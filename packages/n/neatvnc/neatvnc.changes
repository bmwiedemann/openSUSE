- Update to version 0.2.0
- Tight encoding is no longer experimental and also more complete.
  + The encoder employs multiple CPU cores, both for lossy and lossless
    compression, which makes it considerably faster than ZRLE, even with
    lossless compression.
  + Supports both lossy (JPEG) and lossless (DEFLATE) compression.
  + Allows the client to choose the JPEG "quality" level.
  + Allows the client to choose whether to enable lossy compression or not.
- Service-side resizing: the server can notify the client and resize buffers
  when a different display mode is set
- The API has been prepared for adding multi-display suppport. It has not been
  implemented, but the (hopefully) won't have to change when it is.
- Version info is baked into the library, so applications linking to neatvnc
  can report the version to the user.
- The server can now looks up the address to which to bind using getaddrinfo
