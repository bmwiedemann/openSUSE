- Update to 0.7.1:
  * Apple's Diffie-Hellman authentication (security type 30) has been fixed.
  * A new client connection no longer causes a DNS lookup.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct  5 07:44:56 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.7.0:
  * Desktop resizing
  * Software pixel buffers with less than 32 bits per pixel are now supported
  * The server may now choose to open a websocket instead of a regular TCP socket
  * The RSA-AES and RSA-AES-256 security types have now been implemented
  * A Diffie-Hellman based security type frame Apple is also implemented,
    although not recommended
  * Murmurhash in the damage refinery has been replaced with xxHash,
    which performs much better in my tests so far
  * Users should now get proper feedback when authentication fails

Mon Jan 23 16:37:06 UTC 2023 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.0:
  Highlights:
  * The client now has control over h264 quality settings
  * Left & right scrolling is now supported
  * A custom framebuffer allocator function can now be assigned
  * The following functions have been added
    + A function for querying client side cursor support
    + A function to get the hostname of a connected client
    + A function to get the credentials of an authenticated client
    + A function for listing connected clients
    + A function for disconnecting a client
  Bug fixes:
  * A race condition when a client tries to resize the display before it has an encoder
  * Cursor buffers are now freed on close
  * Various race conditions in encoders
  * Spurious exits due to SIGPIPE
  * Occasional leaked buffers when clients disconnect
  * Clients no longer linger on exit with TLS

- "Pkgconfigify" BuildRequires, align with what meson checks for.
- Modernize spec.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 22:50:04 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.4:
  * This fixes stalling during h264 encoding. The FFmpeg devs
    seem to think that it's normal to change the default behaviour
    of their code, so this needs to be fixed here instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 22:49:49 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.3:
  * Revert "h264-encoder: Add 30 bit color depth formats"
  * server: Fix encoding selection for sw frames

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 22:49:33 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.2:
  * stream: Remove stray ampersand in tls handshake failure code path
  * resampler: Use transformed width as destination stride

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 22:49:16 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.1:
  * meson: Use partial_dependency() for libdrm cflags
  * test: meson: Add missing libdrm_inc dependency
  * server: add missing header after f20ffb5e1efe

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 22:48:50 UTC 2022 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.0:
  * H.264 Encoding
  * UNIX Sockets
  * New framebuffer submission API
  * Automatic buffer transforms
  * Client side cursor rendering
  * Now accepts DMA-BUFs
  * Presentation time stamps
  * New internal encoder abstraction layer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 28 20:42:39 UTC 2021 - Dirk Müller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.4.0:
  * This release adds support for the qemu extended key event. When this is
    also supported by the client, key codes will be used instead of symbols
    which eliminates the need for reverse key code lookup on the server-side. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 30 08:28:57 UTC 2020 - Dirk Mueller <dmueller@suse.com>

- update to 0.3.2:
  * This release fixes a crash due to incorrect handling of fragmented packets
  and adds copy & paste support.
  * This release fixes a bug with tight encoding reported by Jeroen Hofstee

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 28 09:08:39 UTC 2020 - Alexander Graul <alexander.graul@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.2.0
- Tight encoding is no longer experimental and also more complete.
  + The encoder employs multiple CPU cores, both for lossy and lossless
    compression, which makes it considerably faster than ZRLE, even with
    lossless compression.
  + Supports both lossy (JPEG) and lossless (DEFLATE) compression.
  + Allows the client to choose the JPEG "quality" level.
  + Allows the client to choose whether to enable lossy compression or not.
- Service-side resizing: the server can notify the client and resize buffers
  when a different display mode is set
- The API has been prepared for adding multi-display suppport. It has not been
  implemented, but the (hopefully) won't have to change when it is.
- Version info is baked into the library, so applications linking to neatvnc
  can report the version to the user.
- The server can now looks up the address to which to bind using getaddrinfo
