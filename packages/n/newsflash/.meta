  <description>NewsFlash is a program designed to complement an already existing web-based RSS reader account.

It combines all the advantages of web based services like syncing across all your devices with everything you expect from a modern desktop program: Desktop notifications, fast search and filtering, tagging, handy keyboard shortcuts and having access to all your articles for as long as you like.</description>
