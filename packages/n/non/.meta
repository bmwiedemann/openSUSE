  <title>Non modular digital audio workstation</title>
  <description>The Non DAW Studio is a modular system composed of four main parts:
Non Timeline, a non-destructive, non-linear audio recorder and
arranger. Non Mixer, a live mixer with effects plugin hosting and
advanced Ambisonics spatialization control. Non Sequencer, a live,
pattern based MIDI sequencer, and finally, the Non Session Manager
to tie together these applications and more into cohesive
song-level units.</description>
