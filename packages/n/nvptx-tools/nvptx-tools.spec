%description
A collection of tools for use with nvptx-none (NVIDIA Parallel Thread
Execution) GCC toolchains.

* nvptx-none-as: "assembler" for PTX.
* nvptx-none-ld: "linker" for PTX.
* nvptx-none-run: run PTX binaries compiled with -mmainkernel.
* nvptx-none-run-single: like nvptx-none-run, but locked, such that
  system-wide, only one instance of it is running at a time.
