  <title>NDP Proxy Daemon</title>
  <description>ndppd is a daemon that proxies certain IPv6 NDP messages between two or more
interfaces. It currently supports proxying Neighbor Solicitation Messages
and Neighbor Advertisement messages in order to allow IPv6 routing without
relying on Linux &quot;proxy_ndp&quot;.

The daemon is partially compliant with (experimental) RFC4389.
