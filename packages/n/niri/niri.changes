    move-column-right-or-to-monitor-right actions
  * Added a middle-emulation flag to touchpad, mouse, and
    trackpoint settings
  * Added a background-color option to outputs that sets the color
    of the default niri solid background.
  * Added Mod3/ISO_Level5_Shift modifier support to key bindings
  * Enabled sub-pixel glyph positioning for better kerning in
    niri panels

Sat Jun 29 07:23:35 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.1.7
  * The big update this time is fractional scale support. You can
    set output scale to fractional values like 1.5 and automatic
    scale factor guessing will now return fractional scale factors.
  * niri layout now completely operates in floating-point. While
    fractional scaling benefits the most from this, fractional
    layout is also useful for integer scales.
  * You can now select an individual window to screencast through
    xdg-desktop-portal-gnome. You can resize windows, open pop-ups,
    use block-out rules, and it will all work correctly.
  * implemented the xdg-activation-v1 protocol which allows apps to
    pass focus to other apps.
  * added the vertical drag gesture to switch workspaces, just like
    on a touchpad you can swipe both horizontally and vertically.
  * Added four actions focus-window-{up,down}-or-column-{left,right}
    which allow traversing all windows on a workspace in order.
  * Added actions focus-column-right-or-first, focus-column-left-or-
    last which allow the focus to loop around.
  * Added actions focus-column-or-monitor-left and focus-column-or-
    monitor-right that switch the monitor upon reaching the end of
    the workspace.
  * Added niri msg focused-output which returns information about
    the currently focused output.
  * Added off flag to disable input devices.
  * Added left-handed flag to touchpad, mouse, tablet input config.
  * Added scroll-method property to touchpad, mouse, trackpoint
    input config.
  * Added disabled-on-external-mouse flag to touchpad input config.
  * Niri now additionally reads the config file path from
    $NIRI_CONFIG, to help with nix wrappers. The --config flag
    still takes precedence.
  * Changed absolute pointer input to work over a union rectangle
    across all outputs, rather than picking a single output.
  * Changed tablet input without a specific map-to-output to map to
    a union rectangle across all outputs. This makes Open Tablet
    Driver work.
  * Changed foreign-toplevel (i.e. Waybar) window activation to
    animate the workspace switch.
  * Fixed focus-window-or-workspace-{up,down} missing the workspace
    switch animation.
  * Fixed empty named workspaces disappearing upon output removal.
  * Fixed a crash when an (already unfullscreened) window that in a
    column with other windows requests to be unfullscreened.
  * Fixed key repeat not working when the keyboard config section is
    missing.
  * Fixed some crashes when no outputs are connected. On some devices
    outputs reconnect themselves upon resuming from sleep, which was
    triggering these issues.
  * Fixed rounded corners rendering blurry on very high scale factors.
  * Fixed the automatic draw border with background check to also
    include the KDE decoration protocol value. This makes it work for
    some older clients like GTK 3 (thanks @kchibisov).
  * Fixed ISO_Level3_Shift modifier not showing up in the Important
    Hotkeys list.
  * Niri now increases the fd limit to the maximum, fixing some
    fd-heavy clients (e.g. running RustRover in Xwayland).
  * Updated Smithay, which fixes running on the NVIDIA 555 driver
    (explicit sync is still not implemented for now).
- Enable arch i586 again

Sat Apr 20 22:27:51 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.1.5
  * A big focus in this release was on animations. I've animated
    many more actions: window movement, resizing, and closing.
  * Spring animations are now more robust: values and durations are
    clamped more aggressively where it makes sense.
  * Niri now has basic variable refresh rate (VRR) support.
  * IPC improvements
  * Added an allow-when-locked=true flag for spawn key bindings
    that makes them work when the session is locked.
  * Previous view position is now restored upon unfullscreening a
    window.
  * The SIGPIPE handler is now set to default in niri msg to
    prevent panic backtraces from showing up when stdout is closed.
  * The mouse cursor is now hidden upon touchscreen interaction.
  * Corrected some DRM leasing behavior to fix crashes when DRM
    leasing is unavailable and better handle hotplugging.
  * Added an ease-out-quad easing curve.
  * Fixed warp-mouse-to-focus not triggering when a window is
    closed by unmapping its buffer.
  * Fixed the horizontal touchpad gesture redrawing continuously
    rather than only on touchpad events.
  * Fixed overdamped spring instability being able to crash the
    compositor.
  * Added a microphone mute example bind to the default config.
