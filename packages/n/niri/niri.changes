- Update to version 0.1.5
  * A big focus in this release was on animations. I've animated
    many more actions: window movement, resizing, and closing.
  * Spring animations are now more robust: values and durations are
    clamped more aggressively where it makes sense.
  * Niri now has basic variable refresh rate (VRR) support.
  * IPC improvements
  * Added an allow-when-locked=true flag for spawn key bindings
    that makes them work when the session is locked.
  * Previous view position is now restored upon unfullscreening a
    window.
  * The SIGPIPE handler is now set to default in niri msg to
    prevent panic backtraces from showing up when stdout is closed.
  * The mouse cursor is now hidden upon touchscreen interaction.
  * Corrected some DRM leasing behavior to fix crashes when DRM
    leasing is unavailable and better handle hotplugging.
  * Added an ease-out-quad easing curve.
  * Fixed warp-mouse-to-focus not triggering when a window is
    closed by unmapping its buffer.
  * Fixed the horizontal touchpad gesture redrawing continuously
    rather than only on touchpad events.
  * Fixed overdamped spring instability being able to crash the
    compositor.
  * Added a microphone mute example bind to the default config.
