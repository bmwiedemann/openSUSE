    palmtopnm: Fix bug: fails with PackBits input on platform with

    to convert PackBits input was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).

    sunicontopnm, escp2topbm, mgrtopbm, ybmtopbm, pamcut, pbmpscale,
    pnmcat, pnmpad: Fix arithmetic overrun with ridiculously large
    image.

    the image than the first.  Always broken (Pamrubber was new in
    Netpbm 10.54 (March 2011)).

    libnetpbm: When validating computable size of width and height,
    allow for adding up to 10 instead of 2, to account for rounding
    up to a multiple of 8 in processing bit maps.

    specified -transparent.  Broken in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).

    grayscale and black and white PAM images with transparency.

    Mingw platform.  Bug introduced in Netpbm 10.94 (March 2021).

    Build: Don't attempt to build 'pamexec' on systems without
    Unix process management.  Bug introduced in Netpbm 10.94

    Use internal random number generator everywhere random numbers
    are used except ppmtoilbm, so seeded results are the same on
    all platforms.

    pamexec: Issue message instead of being killed by a signal when
    the exec'ed program does not read the whole image"

    ppmforge: Fail if -dimension is greater than 5, which is
    useless.

  * pnmconvol: Extend -normalize to be applicable to convolution
    kernels specified by PGM file.  Thanks Anton Shepelev
    <anton.txt@gmail.com>
  * g3topbm: tolerate fill bits.
  * pbmtog3: Add -align8, -align16.
  * ppmshadow: Improve results for very small maxval.
  * ppmshadow: eliminate extraneous messages from pnmconvol.
  * libnetpbm: Improve error message for purported image that is
    exactly 1 byte long (so ends in the middle of what would be the
    magic number).
  * pbmtox10bm: Get the Perl interpreter for this Perl program from
    the PATH instead of hardcoded as /usr/bin/perl (like all other
    Netpbm Perl programs).
  * ppmcolormask: fix incorrect output when input maxval is not 255.
  * bmptopnm: fix crash when input is a Windows BMP with negative
    number for width.  Always broken.  (bmptopnm was new, as
    bmptoppm, in original Netpbm, 1992).
  * pamcomp: fix incorrect output with -mixtransparency.
    Always broken.  (-mixtransparency was new in Netpbm 10.56,
    September 2011).
  * pamcomp: remove debug trace message with -mixtransparency.
    Always broken.  (-mixtransparency was new in Netpbm 10.56,
    September 2011).
  * pnmtojpeg: fix array bounds violation in argument list.  Always
    broken (pnmtojpeg was new to Netpbm in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000).
  * pamcrater: fix incorrect output with non-square image.
    Introduced in Netpbm 10.69 (December 2014).
  * svgtopam: fix treating negative width or height values in SVG
    like twos complement positive numbers; fail instead.  Always
    broken (svgtopam was new in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006)).
  * svgtopam: fix error messages when input has splines or negative
    positions.  Always broken (svgtopam was new in Netpbm 10.33
    (March 2006)).
  * libnetpbm: fix bug: pm_system_XXX closes Standard Input if you
    supply a Standard Output accepter but not a Standard Input
    feeder.  Broken since Netpbm 10.40 (September 2007).
  *  Build: don't try to build standardppmdfont.c if it already
    exists (so don't require ppmdcfont to exist).  Broken around
    Netpbm 10.35 (2006).
   * Build: Define _XOPEN_SOURCE=500 in source files that use M_PI.
    While C libraries in the past have always provided this with
    just _XOPEN_SOURCE=null, it appears that M_PI is actually
    defined by Single Unix Specification 2, aka UNIX98, for which
    you need _XOPEN_SOURCE=500, and Cygwin has changed to enforce
    this.

  * xpmtoppm: fix bogus "color number too large" failure.  Broken
              in 10.49 (December 2009).
  * pnm_hashtuple: slight performance improvement from new hash
              function.  Thanks Prophet of the Way <afu@wta.att.ne.jp>.
