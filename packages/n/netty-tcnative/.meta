  <title>Fork of Tomcat Native with improved OpenSSL and mavenized build</title>
  <description>netty-tcnative is a fork of Tomcat Native. It includes a set of changes
contributed by Twitter, Inc, such as:
 *  Simplified distribution and linkage of native library
 *  Complete mavenization of the project
 *  Improved OpenSSL support
To minimize the maintenance burden, we create a dedicated branch for each stable
upstream release and apply our own changes on top of it, while keeping the
number of maintained branches to minimum
