- Update to release 11.4.1
  * Fixed bug in new NTL_EXEC_DIVIDE that could manifest itself
    when NTL_THREAD_BOOST=off. Existing code that does not
    explicitly use this feature should not be affected by this
    bug.

  * The Schoenhage–Strassen FFT for both ZZ_pX and ZZX is now fully
    "thread boosted".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Specfile modernization.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 15 21:32:45 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 11.3.2
  * Fixed a performance issue in the PowerMod function for the
    ZZ class.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 25 09:35:51 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 11.3.1
  * Fixed a bug that effected image, kernel, and gauss routines
    for Mat<zz_p>. These routines did not behave correctly when
    the input matrix was zero. Also improved the mat_lzz_pTest
    program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 29 20:44:41 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 11.3.0
  * Performance tuned GF2EX arithmetic. Tuned crossovers for
    various algorithms.
  * Implemented asymptotocially fast GCD and XGCD for GF2EX,
    zz_pEX, and ZZ_pEX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 12:24:57 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 11.2.1
  * The low-level "small-prime" FFT (a.k.a., NTT) was rewritten. It
    implements a "truncated" FFT, which can speed up polynomial
    multiplication by a factor of two, and which mainly eliminates
    "jumps" in the running time at powers of two. The new FFT
    routines are in fact a bit faster even at powers of two.
  * Improved performance of ZZ mul and sqr on small inputs:
    mul speedup: 1 limb: 2.5x; 2 limbs: 1.4x; 3 limbs: 1.3x.
  * More efficient implementation of low-level butterfly
    operations.
- Remove ntl-automake.diff, add no-static.diff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  6 13:24:18 UTC 2018 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 11.0.0
  * Multithreading is enabled. To get these speedups, you have to
    call SetNumThreads.
  * Thread boosted all cubic-time operations in mat_ZZ_pE,
    mat_lzz_pE, and mat_GF2E. This includes: matrix
    multiplication, inversion, determinant, kernel, image, and
    solving linear systems.
  * Thread boosted RandomPrime, GenPrime, and GenGermainPrime.
  * New functions: GetWallTime, VectorRandomWord.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- ntl-automake.diff: add missing header file for flint

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  9 21:09:02 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 10.5.0
  * Faster linear algebra over ZZ_p. Rewrote mat_ZZ_p routines
    inv, solve, determinant, gauss, and kernel to be
    thread boosted.
  * C++11 support / "move" semantics. Iterators and support for
    "range based for loops".

- Update description

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 29 11:16:07 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 10.3.0
  * Marginally improved performance and crossovers for mat_zz_p
    multipliplication.
  * Retired the zz_pXAltArgument class, which was used for modular
    composition in zz_pX. While this has been in in the documented
    interface for a few months, it was flagged as being provisional
    and subject to change. In place of zz_pXAltArgument, the class
    zz_pXNewArgument was added.
  * Implementation of a multi-modular strategy for matrix
    multiplication over ZZ_p.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 20 18:28:08 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 10.1.0
* the classical LIP module is finally thread safe

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep 21 09:18:05 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.11.0
* Improved the effectiveness of the new, faster ZZ to
  zz_p conversion
* Added new routines VectorConv for faster bulk conversion from ZZ
  and long to zz_p
* Added new routines VectorRandomBnd (see ZZ.txt) and VectorRandom
  for faster bulk random number generation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul 31 17:09:21 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.10.0
* Conversions from ZZ to zz_p are now faster, thanks to
  preconditioning. Among other things, the CRT-based ZZX
  multiplication code is also a bit faster as a result.
* The BasicThreadPool class now guarantees that exec_range
  assigns the current thread first=0, and exec_index assigns the
  current thread index=0. This makes it easy for a thread to tell
  whether of not it is the current thread, which can be
  convienient for some applications.
* Fine tuned the interface for SmartPtr and UniquePtr a bit,
  including the ability to attach an explicit deleter policy,
  which (among other things) makes it easier to implement the
  PIMPL pattern using these classes. Unfortunately, some of these
  changes introduced some minor backward incompatibilities (but I
  doubt anyone will even notice).
* Introduced a new class CopiedPtr, which has a similar interface
  to UniquePtr, but which allows copy and assignment. This class
  is meant to replace the OptionalVal class, whose use is now
  discouraged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun 19 20:21:21 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.9.1
* Introduced ll_type and related routines which perform a
  restricted set of operations on a long-long-like type. It can
  be implemented via inline asm, and is a cleaner interface and
  sometimes faster. On x86-64/gcc platforms, the assembly code
  version is used and gives a modest speed boost.
* Introduced PreconditionedRemainder class for faster reduction
  of a ZZ modulo a fixed long. This is intended to make Chinese
  Remaindering type computations faster. (For the time being,
  this is an undocumented feature.)
* Allow p.move(q), where p is a UniquePtr<T>, q is a
  UniquePtr<Y>, and Y* converts to T*.
* Added elts() method to UniqueArray and AlignedArray (for
  compatibility with Vec class)
* Added get() and release() methods to OptionalVal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 17 21:57:51 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.7.0
* Changes to mat_lzz_p: improved performance of mul, inv, solve
  and deterministic routines
* NTLThreadPool is no longer directly accessible: new access
  functions are provided
* Got rid of method SplitProblems, and made a more general/abstract
  class PartitionInfo

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 11 23:00:45 UTC 2016 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.6.4
* A new modular composition implemention for zz_pX. This makes
  modular composition up to 3x faster, depending on several
  factors.
* Improved performance for polynomial factoring over zz_pX using
  CanZass, using the improved modular composition routine (above)
  and better choice of baby step / giant step parameters. This
  leads to a 1.1x to 1.8x speedup, depending on several factors.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 14 11:23:04 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.6.2
* Performance tuning: ZZ_pX and zz_pX keep getting faster
* Upgrade to pseudo-random number generation: replaced the
  underlying PRG with Chacha20 (replacing RC4) and the underlying
  key-derivation function with a function based on HMAC-SHA256
  (replacing an MD5-based function). The new routines are faster
  and more secure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 24 08:49:29 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.2.0
* Performance improvements to zz_pX and Vec<zz_p>.
* Performance improvements to ZZX: implemented asymptotically fast
  CRT code for HomMul and more cache-friendly logic.
* Completed the transition away from floating-point arithmetic for
  the implementation of single-precision modular arithmetic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 27 16:15:01 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 9.0.0
* The interface to the single-precision modular arithmetic
  routines has been modified slightly: In particular, on 64-bit
  x86/GCC platforms, single precision moduli can now be up to 60
  bits, rather than 50 bits. Using larger moduli speeds up a number
  of things, like ZZ_pX arithmetic, as fewer primes need to be used
  in Chinese Remaindering steps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 12 12:34:59 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update ntl-automake.diff: add a missing backslash causing not all
  headers to be installed. Support mingw a bit better, too.
  Support non-C++11 systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb  3 00:06:14 UTC 2015 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 8.1.2
* Added support for "user defined" FFT primes for zz_p.
* Added explicit constructors corresponding to promotions.
* Thread safety, requires C++11 concurrency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 18 15:18:06 UTC 2014 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 6.1.0
* Replaced the old template-like macros for vectors, matrices, and
  pairs with true template classes: Vec<T>, Mat<T>, and Pair<S,T>.
* There are many new conversions provided.
* Improve speed for single-precision FFT
* Added support for "user defined" FFT primes for <tt>zz_p</tt>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
