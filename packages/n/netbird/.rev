    <comment>- update to 0.60.1:
  * [management] Fix direct peer networks route by @pascal-fischer
    in #4802
  * [management] pass config to controller by @pascal-fischer
    in #4807
  * [management] Add native ssh port rule on 22 by @mlsmaycon in
    #4810

- add ssh test cases which no longer work to the filterlist

- update to 0.60.0:
  Native SSH Access &amp; OpenSSH Integration
  NetBird v0.60.0 ships a complete rewrite of SSH access. Every
  peer can now run a built-in SSH server, giving you
  identity-aware, private SSH access over your NetBird network —
  using either the netbird ssh command or your existing OpenSSH
  clients.
  Highlights:
  - Built-in SSH server on every peer - Enable with netbird up
    --allow-server-ssh and get a native SSH endpoint without
    exposing port 22 to the internet.
  - Identity-aware access with JWT - SSH sessions are authenticated
    via your IdP (OIDC/JWT) by default, so you know which user
    accessed which machine.
  - Works with netbird ssh and OpenSSH - Use netbird ssh
    user@&lt;peer-ip&gt; or standard ssh, sftp, and scp commands; NetBird
    configures OpenSSH automatically via a drop-in 99-netbird.conf.
  - Port 22, transparently secured - NetBird listens on TCP 22022
    and redirects NetBird-network port 22 traffic to it, so
    existing SSH workflows keep working without changing ports.</comment>
