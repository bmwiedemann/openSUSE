%description
The ncompress package contains the "compress" and "uncompress"
utilities which are compatible with the original UNIX compress
utility (.Z file extensions).

Install ncompress if you need compression/decompression utilities
which are compatible with the original UNIX compress utility. gzip is
also able to decompress .Z files, though ncompress will not recognize
.gz files at all.
