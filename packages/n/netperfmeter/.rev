    <comment>- Update to version 1.9.0
  Use different payload data patterns for Active -&gt; Passive and Passive -&gt; Active directions.
  Added note on SCTP usage with 192.168.122.1 interface.
  Added test script for Wireshark dissector tests.
  Enable 30s SCTP Heartbeats on control connection, to ensure PAT/NAT will keep the connection alive.
  Updated Wireshark color filter example.
  Bugfix: Make sure to deregister all flows belonging to a closed control connection.
  Improved DCCP detection.
  Commented out LK-SCTP bug work-around. It is hopefully not needed any more.
  Bugfix: fixed possibilities for race conditions reported by Helgrind.
  Bugfix: fixed UDP flow identification.
  Improved vector output.
  Bugfix: fixed improper deletion. Access to deallocated memory was possible.
  Bugfix: make sure to clear address space (Valgrind reported access to uninitialised memory).
  Bugfix: fixed handling of new flows on active side (variable was uninitialised).
  Also write time stamps into scalars.</comment>
