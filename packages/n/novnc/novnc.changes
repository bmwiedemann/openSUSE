        to WebSockets

        the screen element as well

      * Fixed a disconnect that happened when using some VNC servers. The error
        displayed in this case was "Error decoding rect: TypeError"

        useful if you're using a password manager
      * Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped. This made it possible to use
        more modern features and clean up a large number of workarounds
