Skip 'test/parallel/test-fs-utimes-y2K38.js' on some platforms.

This test fails if coreutils' touch was built with 64-bit time_t,
while nodejs was built with 32-bit time_t.  This is currently the case
on i586, ppc and armv7l.  Skip the failing last command on those
platforms.

The failure was seen since coreutils-9.0.

Remove this patch once nodejs(1) also builds with 64-bit time_t.
