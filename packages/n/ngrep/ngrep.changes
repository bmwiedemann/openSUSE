  * Add Solaris IPnet support
  * Update to use 32bit values where relevant

    PCAP stats)

    compilation on other platforms

    GNU regex

- Dol not pass --disable-pcap-restart to configure: this is the
  default and the configure check is quite broken in processing it:
  --disable-pcap-restarted is treated equal to --enable-pcap-restart.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec  1 18:29:35 UTC 2015 - p.drouand@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.46.1
  * actual bugfix for the VLAN parsing issue.  prior version 1.46 expanded
    the BPF filter to include IPv4/6 traffic, but the offset calculation
    forgot to account for the variable presence of VLAN headers.  now
    ngrep detects VLAN frames in every packet and adjusts the offset on
    the fly.
- Changes from version 1.46
  * configure.in: re-organized, in part t  * sync with downstream patches
    (which were never sent upstream)
  * configure.in: removed included PCRE library, now builds against system
    version when specified (default is included GNU Regex)
  * configure.in: fixed duplicate PCAP header check, which broke with the
    release of libpcap 1.0
  * configure.in: prefixed all tack-on autoconf variables from _FO  * -> EXTRA_FOO
  * Makefile.in: capitulated t  * Debian: use tar.gz instead of tar.bz2
  * ngrep.c: Call setlocale t  * make isprint() work based on current
    locale (bdo#307496).
  * include tcpkill functionality (-K), a long-standing downstream patch
    under Debian
  * updated t  * latest autoconf
  * updated copyrights t  * 2014
- Remove obsolete patches
  * 10_debian-build.diff
  * 20_setlocale.diff
  * 40_ipv6-offsets.diff
- Update project Url
- Use download Url
- Enable tcpkill function with "--enable-tcpkill" configure switch
  and add libnet-devel build dependency for openSUSE > 12.1
