-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 18:39:15 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.40.12:
  + Make sure "external-ids" stays up to date in Open vSwitch
    database on a connection reapply.
  + Retry if a netlink sockets runs out of buffer space before
    we're able to read results of a link change.
  + Fix a possible race involving concurrent invocation of iptables
    in IPv4 shared mode.
  + Other various fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 11 11:17:01 UTC 2023 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.40.10:

  + nm-cloud-setup now preserves addresses added externally.
  + Ensure that dnsmasq is stopped after changing the dns backend
    and restarting the service.
  + Fix honoring an explicit DHCPv6 DUID with dhclient.
  + Other various fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 20 18:09:19 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

  + Fixed a bug that caused devices (MACsec in particular) to be
    stuck in UNAVAILABLE state and not transition to DISCONNECTED
    if the carrier was ready too early.
  + Improved interoperability of MACsec with some Aruba switches by
    allowing CKN shorter than 64 characters.

    access.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 20 10:29:10 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop iptables BuildRequires and -Diptables meson parameter:
  iptables is legacy (obsoleted in favor of nft). Additionally.
  meson has proper fallback detection to assume the correct path,
  should it need to use iptables.
- Recommend nftables instead of iptables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  2 22:01:53 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.40.6:
  + team:
    - Also set empty port configuration so teamd knows about the
      port.
    - Restore port configuration after teamd respawn.
- Changes from version 1.40.4:
  + dhcp: revert restarting DHCP when MAC address changes, for
    example during a bond fail over.

  + Fix non-exported ABI in libnm which was wrongly present in the
    header files but unusable so far.
  + ifcfg-rh: fix writing ethtool pause settings to file.
  + core: set "proto static" for manual routing rules configured by
    NetworkManager.
  + Various minor bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov  7 12:50:13 UTC 2022 - Clemens Famulla-Conrad <cfamullaconrad@suse.com>

- Keep netconfig support. The rc-manager auto detection will select
  appropriate manager during runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  2 16:07:30 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Use a with_netconfig define instead of relying on bcond: bcond is
  meant to have extrenally controllable build conditions (build -D,
  or OBS prjconf).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Oct 18 08:57:13 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.40.2:
  + Ensure that resolv.conf gets updated when the configuration
    changes.
  + Fix setting as bond primary an interface that doesn't exist yet
    when the bond is activated.
  + The number of autoconnect retries is now accounted
    independently for each device when there are profiles with
    multi-connect=multiple.
  + Don't print duplicate entries in the output of "NetworkManager
    --print-config".
  + Fix the ifcfg-rh plugin to properly read infiniband P-Key
    connection profiles without an explicit interface name.
  + Allow the removal of a bond port connection profile from the
    bond via nmcli.
  + Fix race condition during the activation of veth profiles when
    the peer already exists.

    address detection (DAD).
  + Wait that devices get carrier before trying to resolve the
    system hostname on them via DNS.
  + Fix race condition during the initial activation of OVS
    interfaces.
  + Profiles generated by nm-initrd-generator now have lower than
    default priority.
  + Fix error when adding many SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct 10 14:11:34 UTC 2022 - Stefan Schubert <schubi@localhost>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Oct  3 10:20:20 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop dependency on sysconfig-netconfig: the collection of shell
  scripts is not required for regular operation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 26 19:31:20 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.40.0:
  + During the build, stop relying on intltool for i18n and use
    gettext only.
  + Undeprecate nm_remote_connection_get_secrets() in libnm.
  + NetworkManager now will restart DHCP if the MAC changes on a
    device.
- Drop intltool BuildRequires following upstream changes.
- Refresh patches with quilt.
- Stop passing dnssec_trigger=%{_libexecdir}/dnssec-trigger-script
  to meson, support dropped upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 11 17:25:06 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.38.4:
  + Fix DAD for DHCPv6 addresses.
  + Wi-Fi: improvements for OWE networks.
  + Support EC private keys.
  + Various bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 28 13:34:51 UTC 2022 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Create /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d by default, allowing easy
  override for NetworkManager.conf file with drop-in.
- Move default config file to
  /usr/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, as part of main
  package.
- Branding upstream package is now just a config drop-in to
  disable conncheck.
- Ensure /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d is part of the package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 24 10:21:43 UTC 2022 - Yifan Jiang <yfjiang@suse.com>

- Bring back /sbin/netconfig as build option since the netconfig
  in SLE is not ready for usrmerge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 17 08:40:05 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.38.2:

  + Fix crash while checking WEP capability of Wi-Fi interfaces.
  + Ensure DHCP is restarted every time the link goes up.
  + Fix struct alignment issues seen on some architectures.
  + Various other bugfixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 24 14:23:15 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fold NetworkManager-wifi back into the main package: The dep
  chain is not really different and it causes too many problems for
  users having that split. Not worth the pain (boo#1199710,
  boo#1199706).
- As a consequence, also drop the recommends fro the main package
  to -wifi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 16 08:37:25 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.38.0:
  + Add support for route type "throw".
  + Fix bug setting priority for IP addresses.
  + Static IPv6 addresses from "ipv6.addresses" are now preferred
    over addresses from DHCPv6, which are preferred over addresses
    from autoconf. This affects IPv6 source address selection, if
    the rules from RFC 6724, section 5 don't give a exhaustive
    match.
  + Static IPv6 addresses from "ipv6.addresses" are now interpreted
    with first address being preferred. Their order got inverted.
    This is now consistent with IPv4.
  + Wi-Fi hotspots will use a (stable) random channel number unless
    one is chosen manually.
  + Don't use unsupported SAE/WPA3 mode for AP mode.
  + NetworkManager will no longer advertise frequencies as
    supported when they're disallowed in configured regulatory
    domain.
  + Attempt to connect to WEP-encrypted Wi-Fi network will now fail
    gracefully with a recent version of wpa_supplicant when built
    without WEP support. As long as wpa_supplicant supports WEP,
    NetworkManager will continue to work.
  + Disable WPA3 transition mode for wifi.key-mgmt=wpa-psk if the
    NIC does not support PMF. This is known to cause problems in
    some setups. It is still possible to explicitly configure
    wifi.key-mgmt=sae for WPA3.
  + Add new dummy crypto backend "null" that does nothing.
    NetworkManager uses the crypto library when handling
    certificates for 802.1x profiles.
  + Veth devices with name "eth*" are now managed by default via
    the udev rule. This is to support managing the network in LXD
    containers.
  + The hostname received from DHCP is now shortened to the first
    dot (or to 64 characters, whatever comes first) if it's too
    long.
  + As the insecure WEP encryption for Wi-Fi network is phased out,
    nmcli now discourages its use when activating or modifying a
    profile.
  + Fix connectivity checks in case the check endpoint address
    resolves to multiple addresses.
  + Workaround libcurl blocking NetworkManager while resolving DNS
    names.
  + nmcli: indicate missing Wi-Fi hardware when showing rfkill
    setting.
  + nmcli: add connection migrate command to move a profile to a
    specified settings plugin. This allows to convert profiles in
    the deprecated ifcfg-rh format to keyfile.
  + Set "src" attribute for routes from DHCPv4 to the leased
    address. This helps with source address selection.
  + Various bugfixes and internal improvements.
  + Updated translations.
- Recommend NetworkNanager-wifi from the main package: after the
  split, there is currently nothing pulling in NM-wifi. Preferably
  this would happen based on wifi chips prsence, but that is not
  yet done (boo#1199550).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 14 01:45:23 UTC 2022 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

 - Modify NetworkManager.spec: Split into a few small subpackages
   (bsc#1198128).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  1 08:05:28 UTC 2022 - Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk@suse.com>

- Install nfs dispatcher script in /usr/lib/NetworkManager, not /etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 22 23:30:56 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.36.4:
  + The internal DHCPv4 client now discards NAKs packets coming
    from servers different from the one that sent the offer.
  + Fix activation of PPPoE connections with "pppoe.parent" unset.
  + Fix potential libnm crash when the client object initialization
    gets canceled.
  + Other various fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 16 07:59:45 UTC 2022 - Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@suse.com>

- Do not requires dhcp-client, NM is using its internal client
  by default for a long time now.
- Convert iproute2 and iputils requires to recommends, they
  should not be hard requires.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar  7 11:54:55 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.36.2:
  + When the list of plugins is not specified via "main.plugins" in
    NetworkManager.conf and no build-time default is set with
    "--with-config-plugins-default" configure argument, now all
    known plugins found in the plugin directory are loaded (and the
    built-in "keyfile" plugin is preferred over others).
  + Preserve external ports during checkpoint rollback.
  + Fix removal of ovsdb entry when an OVS interface goes away.
  + Fix DNS configuration for WWAN connections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 24 18:07:36 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.36.0:
  + The handling of Layer 3 configurations has been substantially
    reworked. While this is mostly internal change, it results in
    more robust behavior when addressing information from multiple
    sources (DHCP, manually configured, VPN) need to be applied
    simultaneously. Overall performance and memory use have also
    slightly improved.
  + Manually configured addresses can no longer expire even if the
    same addresses are also obtained dynamically.
  + Code for systemd-based DHCP and DHCPv6 clients has been updated
    from upstream.
  + NTP servers obtained via DHCPv6 are now exposed on the DBus
    API, visible in nmcli and available for use by dispatcher
    scripts.
  + 5G NR (New Radio) modems are now supported.
  + The "rd.znet_ifnames" kernel command line option is now honored
    on network bootups on an IBM s390 platform.
  + Wi-Fi P2P support does now work with the IWD backend, in
    addition to wpa_supplicant backend.
  + Support for special route types have been added: "prohibit",
    "blackhole" and "unreachable".
  + Routes managed by routing daemons are now ignored. This is done
    to address a performance bottleneck on specialized routers.
  + Handling of IP addressing and routing information is now
    slightly more efficient and uses less memory. This is apparent
    on systems with large amount of IP configuration information.
  + It is now possible to start NetworkManager without root user
    privileges. This is experimental doesn't necessarily result in
    a working daemon. NetworkManager service already drops many of
    capabilities available to the root user.
  + WPA3 Wi-FI network security have been improved by enabling new
    H2E (hash to element) method for generating SAE password
    element.
  + It is now possible to select the default Wi-Fi backend
    (wpa_supplicant or IWD) at build-time.
  + Replies from broken DHCP servers that send duplicate address or
    mask options are now handled gracefully.
  + Bridge support has gained the possibility of turning off MAC
    ageing.
  + "configure-and-quit" mode and nm-iface-helper have been
    removed.
  + A number of bugs that could cause NetworkManager to crash in
    rare conditions have been fixed.
- Drop pkgconfig(libteam) BuildRequires and stop passing
  teamdctl=true to meson: No longer build teamdctl support.
- Drop patches fixed upstream:
  + 4685651e7671e064b911a3a05f096908e5ef0580.patch
  + 471e987add98b36520ece72ee493176fc7bc863c.patch

  + aadf0fb64f491f94b2771058621dc140c562b62b.patch
- Drop nm-dhcp-use-valid-lease-on-timeout.patch: Patch was rejected
  upstream.
- Rebase patches with quilt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 21 08:47:08 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Add upstream bug fix patches:
  + 4685651e7671e064b911a3a05f096908e5ef0580.patch: glib-aux: fix
    nm_ref_string_equal_str() Fix comparison with a NULL string
  + 6329f1db5ac75ee3b7d2f7ce062e951a598625fe.patch: libnm/tests:
    fix maybe-uninitialized warning in "test-setting"
  + aadf0fb64f491f94b2771058621dc140c562b62b.patch: libnm/tests:
    fix maybe-uninitialized warning in "test-libnmc-setting"
  + 471e987add98b36520ece72ee493176fc7bc863c.patch: device:
    initialize nm_auto variable in _ethtool_features_reset()
  + 634e023e72d4729788a022ea1fae665af28d1b0f.patch: glib-aux:
    workaround maybe-uninitialized warning with LTO in
    nm_uuid_generate_from_string_str()

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Feb 18 14:30:31 UTC 2022 - Callum Farmer <gmbr3@opensuse.org>

- Use meson LTO setup as NM makes changes to CFLAGS

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 26 21:06:29 UTC 2022 - Luciano Santos <luc14n0@opensuse.org>

- Packaging additions with Autotools replacement:
  + Add Meson build requirement and replace Automake macros with
    Meson equivalent ones as autotools will be deprecated in the
    future.
  + Options passed to Meson to mimmic our default preferences:
    systemdsystemunitdir=%{_unitdir}, udev_dir=%{_udevdir},
    dbus_conf_dir=%{_dbusconfdir}, iptables=%{_sbindir}/iptables,
    dnsmasq=%{_sbindir}/dnsmasq, dnssec_trigger=%{_libexecdir}\
    /dnssec-trigger-script, dist_version=%{version},
    polkit_agent_helper_1=%{_libexecdir}/polkit-1\
    /polkit-agent-helper-1, hostname_persist=suse, switchable
    libaudit=%{libaudit_meson_opt}, iwd=true, pppd=%{_sbindir}\
    /pppd, pppd_plugin_dir=%{_pppddir}, nm_cloud_setup=true,
    bluez5_dun=true, netconfig=%{_sbindir}/netconfig,
    dhclient=%{_sbindir}/dhclient, docs=true, switchable
    tests=%{tests_meson_opt}, more_asserts=0, more_logging=false,
    qt=false, and switchable teamdctl=true (teamctl is about to be
    deprecated).
  + Add conditionalized audit pkgconfig module build requirement to
    allow easier feature testing, and pass
    'yes-disabled-by-default' to 'libaudit' Meson option. As an
    observation: Meson defaults passing 'yes' to this feature.
  + Add explicit c++_compiler build requirement to avoid build
    abortion.
  + Add explicit libselinux pkgconfig module build requirement
    checked by Meson and was already being pulled in by some other
    package.
  + Add polkit-gobject-1 pkgconfig module build requirement checked
    by Meson and needed for user auth-polkit support.
  + Add mobile-broadband-provider-info pkgconfig module build
    requirement checked by Meson and needed for ModemManager1
    interface support.
  + Add sed command to fix server.conf config file location from
    defaultdocdir/NetworkManager/examples to
    defaultdocdir/NetworkManager.
  + Add useful %{_pppddir} and %{_dbusconfdir} macros to spec file,
    while dropping no longed needed pppddir shell variable
    definition and 'test -n "$pppddir" || exit 1' construct.
  + Add "< 1.21" version to libnm-glib-vpn1, libnm-glib4, and
    libnm-util2 < 1.21 to main package's Obsoletes tags, following
    packaging good practices to avoid future unwated behavior
    regarding versioning schemes.
  + Replace %version macro with hardcoded "0.9.1" version to the
    devel subpackage's %name-doc Obsoletes tag following packaging
    good practices to avoid future unwanted behaviors regarding
    versioning schemes (the doc subpackage was merged with the
    devel one in the 0.9.0 release).
  + Pass "%{?no_lang_C}" to %find_lang macro to avoid stripping
    any English translations (the default language) from main
    package.
- Packaging deletions with Autotools replacement:
  + Remove data/server.conf from %doc macro in files section as it
    no longer works with Meson.
  + Remove "rm" command on server.conf file following sed command
    addition to fix the right location of the file.
  + Remove no longer useful conditional build abortion depending
    whether or not netconfig support was found
    'grep "with_netconfig='no'" config.log' since this file isn't
    generated by Meson.
  + Remove no longer needed "find" command for GNU Libtool LA files
    deletion.
  + Drop no longer needed libtool build requirement as Meson does
    not use it.
  + Drop redundant sysconfig-netconfig build requirement as it does
    not add anything to the build anymore.
  + Drop comment about suse-release build requirement not being
    needed anymore, it's been deprecated for almost a decade now.
  + Drop setBadness for 'dbus-file-unauthorized' in the rpmlintrc:
    the new dbus file has been whitelisted already (bsc#1194799).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 20 14:24:56 UTC 2022 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Split out NetworkManager-pppoe, needed to configure regular PPPoE
  connections (Not very common, as most users have PPPoE routers
  for the DSL connections).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 14 17:50:43 UTC 2022 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.34.0:
  + initrd: wait for both IPv4 and IPv6 with "ip=dhcp,dhcp6"
  + core: better handle sd-resolved errors when resolving hostnames
  + nmcli: fix import WireGuard profile with DNS domain and address
    family disabled
  + ndisc: send router solicitations before expiry
  + policy: send earlier the ip configs to the DNS manager
  + core: support linking with LLD 13
  + wireguard: importing wg-quick configuration files with nmcli
    no longer sets a negative, exclusive "dns-priority". This plays
    better with common split DNS setups that use systemd-resolved.
    Adjust the "dns-priority" to your liking after import yourself.
  + NetworkManager no longer listens for netlink events for traffic
    control objects (qdiscs and filters).
  + core: add internal nm-priv-helper service for separating
    privileges and have a way to drop capabilities from
    NetworkManager daemon.
  + bond: add support for setting queue-id of bond port.
  + dns: support configuring DNS over TLS (DoT) with
    systemd-resolved.
  + nmtui: add support for WireGuard profiles.
  + nmcli: add aliases `nmcli device up|down` beside
    connect|disconnect.
  + conscious language: Deprecate 'Device.Slaves' D-Bus property in
    favor of new 'Device.Ports' property. Depracate
    'nm_device_*_get_slaves()' in favor of 'nm_device_get_ports()'
    in libnm.
  + nmcli: invoking nmcli command without arguments will now show
    'default' instead of null address in route4 or route6 section.
- Refresh patches with quilt.
- Replace addFilter("suse-branding-unversioned-requires*") from
  rpmlintrc, with the current branding-requires-unversioned.
- Update our Supplements to current standard.
- Add the new internal nm-priv-helper.service to pre(un)/post(un)
  handling.

  + cloud-setup: fix gateway address for Aliyun cloud.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 28 17:13:05 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.32.6:
  + core:
    - Fix adding stale local routes when address changes.
    - Introduce "allowed-connections" option to disallow profiles
      on a device. This allows to filter out profiles that

      activate a profile on start.
  + initrd:
    - Tag generated profiles with origin in user data.
    - Add "ib.pkey=" command line option.
  + dhcp: Handle filename/bootfile_name DHCP option and write it to
    device state file for initrd/kickstart.

    configuration to opportunistically wait for IPv4.
  + ifcfg:
    - Log warning about invalid keys in ifcfg files.
    - Reject non-UTF-8 from ifcfg files.
  + nmcli: show DNS SEARCH field in device information.
  + cloud-setup: add support for Aliyun cloud.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 30 18:39:13 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.32.2 (CVE-2020-13529):
  + hostname: prefer IPv4 addresses for reverse DNS lookup.
  + dhcp: ignore unauthenticated FORCERENEW messages with internal,
    systemd-based DHCPv4 plugin (CVE-2020-13529). This plugin is
    not used, unless the undocumented dhcp=systemd option was set.
  + cloud-setup: preserve IP addresses, routes and rules from
    currently active connection profile.
  + Various bugfixes and performance improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 16 19:51:07 UTC 2021 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.32.0:
  + Now NetworkManager uses systemd-resolved API to lookup the
    system hostname via reverse DNS. If systemd-resolved is not
    available, a 'nm-daemon-helper' binary is spawned to perform
    the lookup using the 'dns' NSS module.
- Rebase patches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 18 02:07:00 UTC 2021 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

- Add nm-add-CAP_CHOWN-capability.patch: Add CAP_CHOWN to
  CapabilityBoundingSet to make teamd work properly
  (glfd#NetworkManager/NetworkManager!860, bsc#1185424).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 14 21:19:14 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Drop networkmanager-obs-net.patch: the patch needs a full rework.
- Drop networkmanager-checks-po.patch: as it was supposed to fix
  something introduced by another patch which we still carry, yet
  we can live with this patch disabled, I'd infer this patch is not
  nescessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 20 09:46:03 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.30.4:
  + Fix crash evaluating match setting properties (CVE-2021-20297).

  + Fix crash with the IWD Wi-Fi backend.
  + Avoid logging warning when setting bond option
    "ad_actor_system=00:00:00:00:00:00".
  + Update SpecificObject D-Bus property of ActiveConnection after
    WiFi roaming.
  + Multiple bugfixes in the initrd generator.
  + Various minor bugfixes.
- Drop NM-restore-MAC-on-release-only-when-cloned.patch: fixed
  upstream.

Thu Apr 15 02:50:08 UTC 2021 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

- Modified NetworkManager.conf: Use dhclient as the default dhcp
  client(bsc#1183202).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  9 06:11:21 UTC 2021 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

- Add nm-dhcp-use-valid-lease-on-timeout.patch: Support valid lease
  file on dhcp timeout(glfd#NetworkManager/NetworkManager!811,
  bsc#1183202).
- Drop nm-fix-dhcp-client-timeout.patch: Replace by the patch
  immediately above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr  9 06:11:21 UTC 2021 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

- Add nm-fix-dhcp-client-timeout.patch: Better handle dhclient's
  timeout so that a recorded lease can be used when dhcp server
  is down(glfo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager!811, bsc#1183202).
- Modified NetworkManager.conf: Use dhclient as the default dhcp
  client(glfo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager!811, bsc#1183202).

- Add NM-restore-MAC-on-release-only-when-cloned.patch: bond:
  restore MAC on release only when there is a cloned MAC address
  (glfo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager!775, bsc#1183967).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Feb 18 18:02:03 UTC 2021 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.30.0:
  + Increase timeout of NetworkManager-wait-online.service to 60
    seconds.
  + Add "ipv4.dhcp-client-id=ipv6-duid" option for RFC4361.
  + The dhcpcd plugin now requires a minimum version of
    dhcpcd-9.3.3 with the --noconfigure option. Using an older
    version will cause dhcpcd to exit with a status code of 1.
  + Support building against musl libc.
  + Support new ethtool offload features.
  + Add support for WPA3 Enterprise Suite-B 192 bit mode.
  + Add support for handling Veth devices.
  + New hostname settings for controlling configuring the hostname
    from reverse DNS lookup and from DHCP.
  + OVS: support configuring external-ids.
  + libnm: nm_setting_bond_add_option() no longer validates the
    option that is set. Instead, use nm_connection_verify() to
    validate the profile.
  + libnm: add support for reading/writing keyfile format. This
    required to relicense previously GPL-2.0+ code as LGPL-2.1+
    with the agreement of the copyright holders.

    - Support for rd.net.timeout.carrier option.
    - Support new ip method "link6" for IPv6 link-local only.
  + build: new configure option to set path to
    "polkit-agent-helper-1".
  + Many bugfixes and improvements.
  + Updated translations.
- Change License to GPL-2.0-or-later and LGPL-2.1-or-later,
  following upstream.
- Replace %systemd_requires with %systemd_ordering.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  4 10:14:10 UTC 2021 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Second attempt to exclude systemd.automount from nfs processing:
  fix boo#1116625

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Dec  6 16:48:42 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.28.0:
  + Change the behavior of nm-initrd-generator so that the
    'ip=off|none' kernel cmdline argument actually generates a
    connection which disables both ipv4 and ipv6. Previously the
    generated connection would disable ipv4 but ipv6 would be set
    to the 'auto' method.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Nov 27 13:36:02 UTC 2020 - Fabian Vogt <fvogt@suse.com>

- Provide service(network) and sysvinit(network) to be an alternative
  to wicked-service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Nov 24 12:35:56 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Pass --enable-lto to configure, build with LTO enabled.
- Stop passing --enable-json-validation to configure, no longer
  needed, nor recognized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 30 10:41:19 UTC 2020 - Hans-Peter Jansen <hpj@urpla.net>

- Exclude systemd.automount from nfs processing: fix boo#1116625
  as suggested from Neil Brown

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct 21 14:09:10 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Update to version 1.27.91:
  + Change the default DNS priority for VPNs from 50 to -50. This
    is a change in behavior and means that when connecting to a VPN
    with the default route, DNS queries will never leak to local
    resolvers. To restore the old behavior, set the DNS priority of
    the connection to 50.
  + The initrd generator now supports creating Infiniband
    connections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 01:27:51 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Rebase patches:
  + 0001-Coerce-connectivity-LIMITED-to-NONE-when-device-is-d.patch
  + NetworkManager-1.10.6-netconfig.patch
  + nm-dont-overwrite-resolv-conf.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 01:27:50 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.27.90:
  + Introduce a new "rc-manager=auto" setting and make it the
    default, unless a different default is chosen at compile time.
    This mode tries to detect "systemd-resolved", "resolvconf", and
    "netconfig".
- Disable patches that needs rebase or dropping:
  + nm-dont-overwrite-resolv-conf.patch
  + NetworkManager-1.10.6-netconfig.patch
  + 0001-Coerce-connectivity-LIMITED-to-NONE-when-device-is-d.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 16 01:27:03 UTC 2020 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.27.3:
  + Introduce new "rc-manager=auto" setting and make it the
    default, unless a different default is chosen at compile time.
    This mode tries to detect "systemd-resolved", "resolvconf",
    and "netconfig" and chooses the mode that seems most suitable
    depending on build setting and runtime detection.
    "resolvconf" and "netconfig" are only considered iff
    NetworkManager was built with the respective options enabled.
- Rebase nm-dont-overwrite-resolv-conf.patch and
  0001-Coerce-connectivity-LIMITED-to-NONE-when-device-is-d.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Oct 15 08:25:35 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.26.4:
  + Add support for the DHCPv4 vendor class identifier option.
  + The initrd generator now supports specifying interfaces by MAC
    address.
  + Automatically add the wildcard DNS domain to VPNs with
    never-default=no and no domains.
  + Allow setting bond "primary" option with modes "tlb" and "alb".
  + Fix peer group tracking of Wi-Fi P2P connections.
  + Fix autoactivating virtual devices after a failure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 20 10:27:40 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.26.2:
  + build: various fixes for LTO.
  + dhcp6: export and handle the DHCPv6 FQDN option.
  + core: fix reapply for bond options.
  + core: improve "connection.wait-device-timeout" to handle
    matching devices not only by interface name and fix race.
  + libnm,core: support "clsact" qdisc.
  + dhcp4: fix bug in internal DHCP client on big endian systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 13 08:54:28 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Own the two empty directories pre-up.d and pre-down.d in
  /usr/lib/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d (boo#1173713).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 13 18:48:22 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.26.0:
  + Add a new build option 'firewalld-zone'; when enabled,
    NetworkManager installs a firewalld zone for connection sharing
    and puts interfaces using IPv4 or IPv6 shared mode in this zone
    during activation. The option is enabled by default.
    Note that NetworkManager still calls to iptables to enable
    masquerading and open needed ports for DHCP and DNS. The new
    option is useful on systems using firewalld with the nftables
    backend, where the iptables rules would not be sufficient.
  + Extend the syntax for 'match' setting properties with '|', '&',
    '!' and '\\'.
  + Add MUD URL property for connection profiles (RFC 8520) and set
    it for DHCP and DHCPv6 requests.
  + Expose raw LLDP message on D-Bus and the MUD usage description
    URL.
  + ifcfg-rh: handle "802-1x.{,phase2-}ca-path". Otherwise setting
    this property silently fails and a profile might accidentally
    not perform any authentication (CVE-2020-10754).
  + ifcfg-rh: handle 802-1x.pin properties.
  + ethernet: reset original autonegotiation/speed/duplex settings
    when deactivating device.
  + Support ethtool coalesce and ring options.
  + Allow team connections to work without D-Bus (e.g. in the
    initrd).
  + Wi-Fi profiles now also autoconnect if all previous activation
    attempts failed. This means, an initial failure to autoconnect
    to the network will no longer block the automatism. A side
    effect is that existing Wi-Fi profiles which previously were
    blocked may now start to autoconnect.
  + NetworkManager now supports "local" type routes beside
    "unicast".
  + Introduce new manual pages nm-settings-dbus and
    nm-settings-nmcli.
  + Mark externally managed devices and profiles on D-Bus.
  + Highlight externally managed devices in nmcli.
  + Add support for a number of bridge options.
  + Add match for device path, driver and kernel command line for
    connection profiles.
  + Fix support for OVS patch interfaces.
  + Support more tc qdiscs: tbf and sfq.
  + Add new provider in nm-cloud-setup for Google Cloud Platform
    which automatically detects and configures the host to receive
    traffic from internal load balancers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  2 02:54:36 UTC 2020 - Jonathan Kang <songchuan.kang@suse.com>

- Rebase nm-add-CAP_SYS_ADMIN-permission.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 29 19:35:31 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.24.2:
  + Add a new build option 'firewalld-zone'; when enabled,
    NetworkManager installs a firewalld zone for connection sharing
    and puts interfaces using IPv4 or IPv6 shared mode in this zone
    during activation. The option is enabled by default. Note that
    NetworkManager still calls to iptables to enable masquerading
    and open needed ports for DHCP and DNS. The new option is
    useful on systems using firewalld with the nftables backend,
    where the iptables rules would not be sufficient.
  + ifcfg-rh:
    - Handle "802-1x.{,phase2-}ca-path". Otherwise setting this
      property silently fails and a profile might accidentally not
      perform any authentication (CVE-2020-10754).
    - Handle 802-1x.pin properties.
  + platform: fix crash detecting device type from netlink.
  + ip-tunnel: only set cloned-mac-address for layer 2 tunnels.
  + Fixes for sanitizer build and valgrind.
  + Various other bugfixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  8 13:51:44 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.24.0:
  + Add support for virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
    interfaces.
  + Add support for Opportunistic Wireless Encryption mode (OWE)
    for Wi-Fi networks.
  + Add support for 31-bit prefixes on IPv4 point-to-point links
    according to RFC 3021.
  + Drop dependencies for libpolkit-agent-1 and
    libpolkit-gobject-1.
  + nmcli:
    - support setting removal via new command
      `nmcli connection modify $CON_NAME remove $setting`.
    - support backslash escape sequences for "vpn.data",
      "vpn.secrets", "bond.options", and "ethernet.s390-options".
  + bridge: support new options "bridge.multicast-querier",
    "bridge.multicast-query-use-ifaddr", "bridge.multicast-router",
    "bridge.vlan-stats-enabled", "bridge.vlan-protocol",
    "bridge.group-address".
  + IPv6 SLAAC: add support for "ipv6.ra-timeout" setting
  + IPv6 DHCP: add support for "ipv6.dhcp-timeout" setting
  + WWAN: NetworkManager now detects if a PIN-protected SIM card
    has been externally unlocked and automatically tries to
    activate a suitable connection on the modem.
  + OVS:
    - add support for changing MTU of OVS interfaces.
    - remove length limitation for OVS Bridge, Patches and
      Interfaces (only Patch types) names.
  + VPN: accept empty values for VPN data items and secrets.
  + All nm-devices now expose the 'HwAddress' property via D-Bus.
  + Slave devices now do not get created/activated if master is
    missing.
  + Fixed multiple issues in the internal "nettools" DHCP client.
  + Export NM_CAPABILITY_OVS capability on D-Bus and in libnm to
    indicate that the OVS plugin is loaded.
  + Fixes for importing WireGuard profiles in nmcli and better
    handle configurations that enable ip4-auto-default-route with
    an explicit gateway.
  + Various bug fixes and improvements.
- Rebase applied patches with quilt.
- Drop pkgconfig(polkit-agent-1) BuildRequires: No longer needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  1 08:31:05 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Prepare the directory structure for the VPN modules. This is the
  directory we instruct VPN services to be installed to as part of
  pkg-config  --variable vpnservicedir libnm. It is this fair that
  we also provide the directory layout.
- Install RPM macros (macros.NetworkManager) as part of the -devel
  package for plugins to get the relevant variables to consume.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 12 15:48:22 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.10:
  + core: periodically cleanup stale device state files from /run.
  + dhcp: fix crash in nettools client.
  + bond: fixed the validation of the miimon option.
  + Various minor bug fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 11 08:24:26 UTC 2020 - Dr. Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>

- Modify nfs script (boo#1164642)
  * Also mount nfs4 shares
  * Ignore nfs or nfs4 shares in case if the noauto option is set

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 18 18:21:13 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.8:
  + Added configuration option to customize IPv6 RA timeout.
  + Internal DHCP client will now request a lease renewal using the
    previously obtained IP address when expired.
  + Removed length limitation for OVS Bridge, Patches and
    Interfaces (only Patch types) names.
  + Fixed initialization of 'secs' DHCP header field, this caused
    some DHCP relays to drop packets.
  + Fixed failure when creating team interfaces using 'nmstate'.
  + Various bug fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  5 15:11:19 UTC 2020 - Michael Gorse <mgorse@suse.com>

- Add -fcommon to CFLAGS. This is currently being done upstream
  (boo#1160381).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 31 10:36:29 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.6:
  + Various fixes for the internal DHCP client.
  + Slave devices now do not get created/activated if master is
    missing.
  + Fixed 'startup-complete' bug where NetworkManager would reach
    the network-online.target even when not all the connections had
    been tried.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jan 25 14:04:08 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- No longer recommend -lang: supplements are in use

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 10 11:09:18 UTC 2020 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.4:
  + Fix behavior of internal DHCP client when the server sends a
    NAK.
  + Support 31-bit prefixes on IPv4 point-to-point links according
    to RFC 3021.
  + Fix memory leak parsing RequestScan D-Bus method arguments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan  8 20:54:45 UTC 2020 - Lorenz Hüdepohl <dev@stellardeath.org>

- Fix 'nfs' dispatcher script
  It was checking for an enabled unit 'nfs.service' - which does not
  exist (anymore?). Switched to a check for an enabled unit
  'nfs-client.target'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 24 16:11:15 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.2:
  + Fix multiple issues in the internal DHCP client, including
    wrong parsing of search domains and classless routes options,
    and failures in obtaining and renewing the lease with certain
    server configurations.
  + Export NM_CAPABILITY_OVS capability on D-Bus and in libnm to
    indicate that the OVS plugin is loaded.
  + Fix libnm annotations for nm_sriov_vf_get_vlan_ids() to allow
    the usage of the function through GObject introspection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 17 12:33:25 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.22.0:
  + Drop support for BlueZ 4. BlueZ 5 was released in 2012 and
    should nowadays be available everywhere.
  + DHCP: switch "internal" DHCPv4 plugin from code based on
    systemd to use nettools' n-dhcp4 library.
  + Add support for "scope" attribute for IPv4 routes.
  + Add support for specifying IAID and FQDN flags for DHCP
    request.
  + Add a '802-1x.optional' property to consider the wired 802.1X
    authentication as optional.
  + Use the Network Cost Wi-Fi information element to determine
    metered device state.
  + Support main.auth-polkit=root-only setting to disable PolicyKit
    use and restrict authorization to root user.
  + core: declare "startup complete" when device reaches
    "connected" state, even if IP addressing methods did not yet
    fully complete. This changes behavior for unblocking
    "NetworkManager-wait-online.service", and
    "network-online.target" earlier. If this causes issues in your
    setup, you may need to configure "ipv4.may-fail=no" or
    "ipv6.may-fail=no", which delays reaching "connected" state for
    the address family accordingly.
  + libnm: hide NMObject and NMClient typedefs from header files.
    This prevents the user from subclassing these types and is an
    ABI change (in the unlikely case that a user was subclassing
    the types, which is no longer supported).
  + libnm: retire deprecated WiMAX API NMDeviceWimax and
    NMWimaxNsp. WiMAX support was removed from NetworkManager in
    version 1.2 (2016) and no such type instances would have been
    created by NMClient for a while now.
  + Deprecate synchronous API for D-Bus calls in libnm. We don't
    remove libnm API so you are free to continue using it. But
    tells you that using it might be a bad idea.
  + libnm: heavily internal rework NMClient. This slims down libnm
    and makes the implementation more efficient. NMClient should
    work now well with a separate GMainContext.
  + Add `nmcli general reload` subcommand to reload NetworkManager
    configuration and DNS settings.
  + nm-cloud-setup: add new tool for automatically configuring
    NetworkManager in cloud. This is still experimental and
    currently only EC2 and IPv4 is supported.
  + Add new NetworkManager logo to "contrib/art/logo".
  + Various bug fixes and improvements.
- Disable networkmanager-checks-po.patch: Needs rebase.
- Add new nm-cloud-setup.service to pre/post/preun/postun calls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 25 15:24:42 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.20.8:
  + Fix handling of system CA certificates in the ifcfg parser.
  + Handle ReachableTime and RetransTimer from IPv6 Router

- Drop NetworkNanager-client recommends: this is no longer needed,
  as NM itself ships a frontend by now (nmtui). If a DE has a
  better way to manage NM (by means of applets or other way of
  integration) it is up to the DE to depend on the applets.

    interface doesn't support it.
  + Various bug fixes and improvements.
  + Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 16:26:34 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.20.0:
  + The libnm-glib library, deprecated in favor of libnm since
    NetworkManager 1.0, and disabled by default since
    NetworkManager 1.12, has now been removed.
  + The DHCP client now defaults to "internal". The default can be
    overriden at build time by using the --with-config-dhcp-default
    option of the configure script or at run time by setting the
    main.dhcp option in the configuration file.
  + Added support for configuring fq_codel line discipline and
    mirred action.
  + Added a possibility for distributions to ship dispatcher
    scripts in /usr/lib.
  + Drop deprecated setting "main.monitor-connection-files" in
    NetworkManager.conf. This setting now has no more effect and
    was disabled by default for a long time. Instead, after
    changes, load files explicitly with `nmcli connection load` or
    `nmcli connection reload`.
  + Rework parsing team JSON config in libnm and stricter validate
    settings. With this, NetworkManager rejects settings that it
    considers invalid while still allowing setting arbitrary JSON
    config directly.
  + Drop ibft settings plugin. This functionality is now covered by
    using nm-initrd-generator from initrd to pre-generate in-memory
    profiles.
  + Support "suppress_prefixlength" attribute for policy routing
    rules.
  + This is what wg-quick uses for the "Improved Rule-based
    Routing" solution, and the user can now manually configure such
    policy routing rules.
  + Support "wireguard.ip4-auto-default-route" and
    "wireguard.ip6-auto-default-route". This automatically
    implements the "Improved Rule-based Routing" of wg-quick to
    help avoiding routing loops when setting the default-route on
    the WireGuard interface. Note that this is now enabled by
    default, so there is a change in behavior if your WireGuard
    connection profiles from before had a default-route (/0) in
    allowed-ips.
  + Rework implementation of settings plugins and how profiles are
    presisted to disk. This is a large internal refactoring of the
    settings plugins that allows to migrate a connection profile
    between plugins.
  + In-memory profiles are now only handled by keyfile plugin and
    will also be persisted to /run directory. This allows to
    restart NetworkManager without loosing these profiles and it
    provides a file-system based API for creating in-memory
    profiles.
  + Keyfile plugin now supports a read-only directory of profiles
    under directory "/usr/lib/NetworkManager/system-connections".
    Such profiles still can be modified and deleted via D-Bus,
    which results in writing profiles to /etc or /run that shadow
    the read-only files.
  + Add new D-Bus method AddConnection2() that allows to block
    autoconnect of the profile at the moment when creating the
    profile. Also add support for this API to libnm.
  + Add flag "no-reapply" to Update2() D-Bus method. Normally, when
    a connection profile gets modified, this only changes the
    profile itself. When the profile is currently activated on a
    device, then the device's configuration does not update before
    the profile is fully re-activated or Reapply on the device is
    called. There is an exception to this: the "connection.zone"
    and the "connection.metered" properties take effect
    immediately. The "no-reapply" flag allows suppressing to
    reapply any properties, so that no changes take effect
    automatically. The purpose is to really only modify the profile
    itself without changes to the runtime configuration of the
    device.
  + Add "ipv6.method=disabled" to disable IPv6 on a device, like
    also possible for IPv4. Until now, the users could only set
    "ipv6.method=ignore" which means the users are free to set IPv6
    related sysctl values themselves.
  + Added support for Wi-Fi Mesh network.
- Stop passing --with-libnm-glib to configure, feature was dropped.
- Drop sub-packages libnm-util2, libnm-glib4 and libnm-glib-vpn1
  and obsolete them from the main package (also in baselibs.conf).
- Drop typelib-1_0-NetworkManager-1_0 and typelib-1_0-NMClient-1_0.
- Rebase some patches with quilt.
- Disable nm-add-CAP_SYS_ADMIN-permission.patch: Needs rework or
  possibly dropping as the ibft plugin is dropped.
- Pass --with-iwd=yes to configure, build experimental IWD backend
  support. Not recommended for endusers, only for testers willing
  to take the risk of broken wifi with no support from distro.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  9 15:26:34 UTC 2019 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 1.18.4:

  to NetworkManager-wait-online.service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 21 12:04:23 UTC 2019 - Antonio Larrosa <alarrosa@suse.com>

- Fix the connectivity value of devices which was set to LIMITED when
  the connectivity check fails. Now if the connectivity is being set
  to LIMITED but the device state is DISCONNECTED, then the value is
  coerced to NONE. Add patch submitted to
  upstream (boo#1103678, glfdo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager#138):
  * 0001-Coerce-connectivity-LIMITED-to-NONE-when-device-is-d.patch

- Fix the global connectivity value which wasn't updated when a
  device was removed. Which is a problem if the device being removed
  is the one providing the connectivity. Add patch submitted to
  upstream (boo#1103678, glfdo#NetworkManager/NetworkManager#141):
  * 0001-Update-connectivity-value-on-device-removal.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 18 07:52:13 UTC 2019 - sckang@suse.com

- Update to version 1.16.0:
  + Check connectivity per address family.
  + Support "main.systemd-resolved" to let NetworkManager configure
    DNS settings in systemd-resolved without making it the main DNS
    plugin of NetworkManager.
  + Write "/var/run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf" with
    original nameservers. That is useful with caching DNS plugins
    like "systemd-resolved" or "dnsmasq" where
    "/var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf" refers to localhost.
  + Change default "ipv4.dhcp-client-id" setting for the internal
    DHCP plugin from "duid" to "mac". This is a change in behavior
    on upgrade when using the internal DHCP plugin (unless the
    default is overwritten in "NetworkManager.conf" or specified
    per connection profile).
  + Improve handling of DHCP router options with internal DHCP
    plugin. For one, accept multiple routers and add a
    default-route to each. On D-Bus expose the original DNS and
    NTP servers without cleaning up local nameservers.
  + Allow binding a connections lifetime to the DBus client that
    activated it.
  + Add support for establishing Wi-Fi Direct connections (Wi-Fi
    P2P).
  + Add support for WireGuard VPN tunnels to NetworkManager. D-Bus
    API and libnm support all options. nmcli supports creating and
    managing WireGuard profiles, with the exception of configuring
    and showing peers.
  + Add initrd generator to be used by dracut and use it as new way
    of handling iBFT.
  + Deprecated "plugins.monitor-connection-files" setting in
    NetworkManager.conf. This option will have no effect in future
    versions.
  + Add AP and Ad-hoc support for iwd Wi-Fi backend.
  + Warn about invalid settings in "NetworkManager.conf".
  + Support announcing "ANDROID_METERED" DHCP option for shared
    mode.
  + Support SAE authentication as used for 802.11s Meshing and
    WPA3-Personal.
  + NetworkManager is no longer installed as D-Bus activatable
    service.
  + Mark docker bridges as unmanaged via udev rule.
  + Add new PolicyKit permission
    "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wifi.scan" for controlling
    Wi-Fi scanning.
- Rebase systemd-network-config.patch and
  nm-dont-overwrite-resolv-conf.patch.
- Drop NetworkManager-1.12.2-docker-unmanaged.patch and
  NM-add-wifi-scan-polkit-rule.patch: Fixed upstream (bsc#1128560).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 17 10:13:20 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Do away with em dashes in summaries.
- Combine %service_* calls to reduce generated boilerplate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 24 00:21:47 UTC 2019 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.14.6:
  + Fix memory corruption in internal DHCPv6 client
    (CVE-2018-15688).
  + No longer limit number of search entires in resolv.conf to 6.
  + Support restricting NetworkManager.conf device configuration
    based on used DHCP plugin.
  + Add "${MAC}" specifier for connection.stable-id. This uses the
    current MAC address for seeding the stable generation of MAC
    address, DHCP client-id or IPv6 stable-privacy interface
    identifier.
  + Support special value "duid" for "ipv4.dhcp-client-id". This
    generates an RFC4361-compliant client-id like the internal DHCP
    client used to do by default. Previously, there was no explicit
    name for such a client-id and it was not usable with dhclient
    DHCP plugin. This also generates the same client-id as
    systemd-networkd does by default.
  + Support and use a new kind of secret-key in
    "/var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key". The secret-key represents
    the identity of the machine that is used for various purposes
    like generating IPv6 stable privacy addesses. It is now
    combined with "/etc/machine-id" so that changing only the
    machine-id results in new identifiers. That matters for example
    when cloning a virtual machine. Previously, the user hard to
    prune NetworkManager's secret-key to get a new identity, now
    regenerating machine-id suffices. Secret-keys generated by
    earlier versions of NetworkManager are not affected and keep
    their previous behavior.
  + Fix the DHCP client-ids based on the MAC address of
    IPoIB/infiniband devices.
  + Fix restoring IP configuration after interface went down.
  + No longer let NetworkManager touch rp_filter setting. The
    rp_filter sysctl must now be set outside of NetworkManager
    according to the admin's preference. Note that a strict
    rp_filter may break valid use-cases and interacts badly with
    connectivity checking.
  + Various bug fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 31 01:12:35 UTC 2019 - sckang@suse.com

- Add NM-add-wifi-scan-polkit-rule.patch: Adding a new polkit

  + Add support for ip6gre/ip6gretap IP tunnels.
  + Add support for detecting WireGuard interfaces (WireGuard VPN
    cannot be controlled via NetworkManager).
  + Add support for configuring SR-IOV devices.
  + Improve error reporting of activation when no device is
    available.
  + Support reapplying changes of the route metric.
  + Support EAP profiles with iwd Wi-Fi backend and support iwd API
    0.8.
  + Expose slaves of OVS bridges and ports.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 26 20:56:06 UTC 2018 - bjorn.lie@gmail.com

- Update to version 1.12.2:
  + Fix missing symbols in libnm ABI for settings.
  + Fix a regression that disallowed activations of VPN connections
    with a device specified.
  + Robustness fixes to connectivity checking.
- Changes from version 1.12.0:
  + Improved support for configuration checkpoint, including
    support in libnm.
  + Added capability to set IP Tunnel configuration flags.
  + The systemd-resolved DNS plugins now supports MDNS.
  + Systemd-resolved and dnsmasq DNS plugins now honor the DNS
    priority setting (CVE-2018-1000135).
  + Wi-Fi devices now support FILS for speedier roaming support.
  + Drop dependency on libnl3 library.
  + Add support for "onlink" routes.
  + More robust connectivity checking.
  + Dropped the obsolete "ifnet" settings plugin,
  + Try harder to generate reasonable human-readable names for
    devices even if the hwdb contains garbage.
  + Add an "overview" option to hide default values in nmcli,
    resulting in more concise output.
  + Reworked the inner workings of D-Bus interface for better
    resource efficiency.
  + Add support for configuring nmcli coloring via
    terminal-colors.d(5).
  + Added experimental support for Meson build system.
  + Added initial IWD Wi-Fi daemon support.
  + A non-hexadecimal DHCPv4 client-id is now properly passed to
    dhclient with the first byte (type) set to zero, as stated in
    the documentation. This represents a change in behavior since
    previous versions where the first character of the string was
    used as type. The internal client is not affected by the
    change.
  + DNS setting rc-manager=file now always follows dangling
    symlinks instead of replacing /etc/resolv.conf with a plain
    file.
  + Added wake_on_wlan connection setting to configure
    wake-on-wireless-lan (WoWLAN).
  + The libnm-glib library, deprecated in favor of libnm since
    NetworkManager 1.0, is now not built by default. While it can
    still be enabled, the distributions should have a good plan for
    removing it if they need to keep shipping it at this point.
  + Nmcli now scans for Wi-Fi networks before displaying them, if
    the last scan was too long ago.
  + Added the ipv6.dhcp-duid property to allow configuring the
    DHCPv6 DUID.
  + Extended ipv6.dhcp-client-id property to support DHCP client
    identifers depending on the MAC address and the stable ID.
  + Set NM_DISPATCHER_ACTION environment variable in dispatcher
    scripts.
- Rebase NetworkManager-1.10.6-netconfig.patch and
  systemd-network-config.patch with quilt.
- Disable networkmanager-obs-net.patch and make check, needs
  rebase.
- Pass with-libnm-glib to configure, deprecated libnm-glib support
  is no long built by default, and since we can not remove this yet
  due to Steam, we pass this option for now.

Wed May 31 13:38:45 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Disable 6 of the tests that are failing on OBS runs
  * networkmanager-obs-net.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 12 10:34:33 UTC 2017 - tchvatal@suse.com

- Version update to 1.8.0:
  * Default routes set by devices that failed connectivity checks are now
    penalized with a higher metric
  * nmcli is now able to produce output more friendly for machine parsing
  * The slaves available at the time a master connection is activated are
    enslaved in a stable order, making the automatic MAC address for Bonding
    devices more predictable.
  * Hostname management is now more flexibly configured
  * Support for additional route options (pref-src, src, tos, window, cwnd,
    initcwnd, initrwnd, mtu, lock-window, lock-cwnd, lock-initcwnd,
    lock-initrwnd, and lock-mtu).
  * Fixed detection of EAP-FAST support in wpa_supplicant
  * Support for handling PINs for PKCS#11 tokens as secrets
  * GSM and CDMA connections now have a MTU property
  * An option to disable selected TLS versions during EAP phase 1
    authentication
  * The 802.1x authentication timeout is now configurable to allow a faster
    fallback to other connections
  * Persist managed state of device until reboot. This improves seamless take
    over of a previously managed device after restart of NetworkManager.
  * Better handle devices that are externally managed by somebody else by
    consistently generating an in-memory connection to reflect the external
    state.
  * Expose SRIOV capability of a device on D-Bus and support configuring the
    number of virtual functions via NetworkManager.conf.
  * Support matching networking devices via new "driver:" device spec in
    NetworkManager.conf.
  * Introduced support for creating and managing dummy links
  * The teaming devices now support setting a hardcoded MAC address
  * Settings of bonding devices can now be modified on-the-fly, without the
    need to reactivate a connection
  * The failures to activate a connection now communicate better error
    responses to nmcli
  * Reverse Path filtering is now disabled in multihoming configurations where
    it would interfere with legitimate network traffic
  * libcurl is used instead of libsoup for connectivity checking, resulting in
    a smaller dependency footprint
  * With DNS mode "rc-manager=symlink", don't write /etc/resolv.conf as
    a symlink if it already exists as a regular file.
  * Support attaching user-data in form of key-value pairs to connection
    profiles.
  * Fix accpeting fully qualified name for ipv4.dhcp-hostname setting.
  * Make NetworkManager more forgiving to failure to change the MAC address
    during scanning.
- Wimax switches are completely removed
- Added dependencies on packages with versions to ensure
  all features are properly detected, configure reports yes for
  most items now
  * add libcurl
  * add libpsl
  * add python-dbus test dep
- Remove gudev and soup deps as per upstream changes
- Enable testsuite
- Add patch networkmanager-checks-po.patch:
  * Our patch added new .in file that needs to be excluded from
    translations

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 19 21:33:23 UTC 2017 - bholst@lusku.de

- Replace nfs NetworkManager dispatcher script. Issues of the old
  nfs dispatcher script, fixed by this commit:
  + It only mounts NFS shares with auto-mount. In SUSE's default
    configuration, those are tried to be mounted at boot.
    Unfortunately, this would not work, when NetworkManager
    handles the connection later. The boot process stops at this
    point.
  + It unmounts everything on each "down" for any network
    interface, even if the NFS share is still connected to the
    computer via another network interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 15 16:12:26 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6.2:
  + Fixed build warnings with GCC 7.
  + Multiple bug fixes in NetworkManager, nmcli and nm-online
    including several crashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 15:39:15 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.6.0:
  + No further changes since rc2 (1.5.91).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 24 12:40:20 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.91:
  + Bugs fixed: bgo#777402, rh#1406454, rh#1414186.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jan 18 12:05:48 UTC 2017 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.90:
  + Avoid reading the permanent MAC address before the device is
    initialized by UDEV. This avoids a race where NetworkManager
    might detect the MAC address of the wrong interface.
  + Fixed race conditions when renaming interfaces, for example as
    done by UDEV for persistent interface naming. This could cause
    detecting devices as the wrong hardware type.
  + Added initial support for PKCS#11 tokens with 802.1x
    authentication.
  + The stable-addressing for MAC address randomization and RFC7217
    IPv6 stable privacy addressing can now be more flexibly
    configured using dynamic randomization seeds in
    "connection.stable-id".
  + Added support for managing the MACsec links. Requires support
    in wpa_supplicant (version newer than 2.6).
  + When the master of Team, Bridge and Bond devices is specified
    as a connection UUID, the ifcfg-rh plugin now writes the master
    connection's interface name into the ifcfg file for improved
    compatibility with the legacy network service.
  + Improve handling of MTU by resetting the previous MTU when the
    device deactivates and reset the MTU to a defined value on
    activation.
  + Improve tracking of parent devices for dependend devices like
    ip-tunnels, MACVLAN, VETH, VLAN, and VXLAN.
  + Many bug fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 17 11:03:49 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.3:
  + The cloned.mac-address property can now be used with Bond and
    Bridge devices.
  + The ifcfg parsing code has been reworked for better
    compatibility with actual shell variable files.
  + The ipv6.method=shared is now supported, utilizing DHCPv6
    Prefix Delegation option to obtain prefixes for the interface.
  + nmtui now supports creating and editing IP tunnel connections.
  + The libnm client library now uses the D-Bus ObjectManager API
    that allows for quicker initialization of the clients.
  + nmtui now utilizes the asynchronous libnm client API to
    paralellize communication with the daemon, reducing the client
    startup time.
  + Ethernet devices now use "802-3.speed" and "802-3.duplex"
    properties to allow controlling overriding the negotiated link
    parameters.
  + Order in which IP addresses are configured is now preserved so
    that primary address is selected correctly.
  + The PPP manager can now be split into a separate package.
  + Details of the DNS information obtained from the connections is
    now exposed on the D-Bus and can be inspected with nmcli.
  + Added the support for DHCPV6_HOSTNAME and DHCPV6_SEND_HOSTNAME
    keys in ifcfg files that control "dhcp-hostname" and
    "dhcp-send-hostname" properties of the "ipv6" setting.
- Add python-gobject BuildRequires: needed in order to build the
  settings documentation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec 17 01:05:02 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.5.2:
  + Introduced Vala bindings for libnm.
  + NetworkManager would now keep most connections up on shutdown
    (except Wi-Fi connections, VPN connections and other kinds that
    can't be assumed on startup)
  + The checkpoint/restore connection can now also remove new
    connections and disconnect devices that were activated since
    the checkpoint was taken.
  + The configuration is now read from /run/NetworkManager/conf.d
    as well. This is useful for handing over configuration
    discovered on system startup to NetworkManager.
  + New connection.autoconnect_retries property that allows
    fine-tuning the autoconnect behavior.
  + Support for configuration and discovery of Web Proxy settings
    with PacRunner service.
  + Support for systemd-resolved local DNS forwarder backend.
  + Fix emission of NM-style PropertiesChanged signals and
    deprecate them for PropertiesChanged on
    "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" interface.
  + Change the meaning of unset "cloned-mac-address" settings from
    "permanent" to "preserve". This changes the default value and
    affects existing connections during upgrade that did not
    explicitly configure cloned-mac-address. This has the effect
    that externally configured MAC addresses are preserved by
    default instead of setting the permanent address (bgo#770611).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec 16 16:28:51 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.4:
  + Order in which IP addresses are configured is now preserved so
    that primary address is selected correctly.
  + Don't deconfigure devices we can take over on shutdown. Makes
    it possible to restart without connection disruption for most
    device types.
  + Avoid reading the permanent MAC address before the device is
    initialized by UDEV. This avoids a race where NetworkManager
    might detect the MAC address of the wrong interface.
  + Fixed race condition when renaming interfaces, for example as
    done by UDEV for persistent interface naming. This could cause
    detecting a Wi-Fi interface as ethernet.
  + Fixed a race condition in libnm that could cause a client hang
    if a last value from a property of object array type
    disappeared.
  + Fixed a possible nmcli hang on D-Bus object fetch failure.
  + Other fixes and improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 20:30:50 UTC 2016 - zaitor@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.2:
  + Fixed emission of NM-style PropertiesChanged signals and
    deprecated them for PropertiesChanged on
    "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" interface.
  + Fixed race condition in the communication between
    NetworkManager and the DHCP helper which caused loss of events.
  + Added workaround for failures in changing MAC address with some
    wireless drivers.
  + Improved bash autocompletion.
  + Restored check on JSON syntax when built with Jansson support.
  + Fixed a regression in the serialization of empty
    "cloned-mac-address" property in libnm.
  + Other fixes and improvements.

  and macro for non-openSUSE only.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 28 16:18:59 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.4.0:
  + The MAC address assigned to a device can now be set according
    to different policies: preserve, permanent, random, stable.
  + NetworkManager now waits for IPv6 DAD to terminate before
    completing the activation.
  + Added support for setting IPv6 tokenized interface identifiers
    through the 'ipv6.token' connection property.
  + Added a 'Reload' D-Bus method to reload configuration and
    reapply DNS configuration.
  + Added ability to create a configuration checkpoints and rolling
    back changes after a timeout.
  + NetworkManager now follows symlinks when accessing resolv.conf
    and rc-manager is set to 'file'.
  + Added support for oFono as modem manager.
  + The devices now exposes counters of transferred data.
  + The 'may-fail' property of ipv4 and ipv6 settings is now
    respected more accurately.
  + The timeout for requests of secrets to agents has been
    increased from 25 to 120 seconds.
  + Name servers passed to dnsmasq now specify an egress interface
    to avoid problems with multiple active connections.
  + Reverse DNS entries for IPv6 are now added to dnsmasq, and IPv4
    reverse entries now honor the network prefix.
  + A new 'dns-priority' property of ipv4 and ipv6 settings can be
    used to tweak the order of servers in resolv.conf when multiple
    connections are active.
  + configure script accepts --enable-{address,undefined}-sanitizer
    options to build NetworkManager with GCC sanitizers.
  + The default resolv.conf manager can now be specified at build
    time using the --with-config-dns-rc-manager-default configure
    option.
  + NetworkManager is now compiled with --gc-sections to reduce
    executable size.
  + Added a new 'VPN_PLUGIN' logging domain.
  + It is now possible to change the configuration currently
    applied on a device with 'nmcli device modify' and 'nmcli
    device reapply'.
  + nmcli invoked without parameters shows an overview of the
    current network configuration.
  + The 'nmcli connection add' syntax has been extended and is now
    possible to pass properties (e.g. 'ipv4.dns') along with
    aliases.
  + nmtui now returns to initial menu after a sub-form exits.
  + Improved bash autocompletion for nmcli.
  + Now devices are disconnected before the system suspends,
    executing dispatcher scripts. This allows external applications
    to be notified of the change in connectivity.
  + Dispatcher scripts are now called also when connectivity status
    changes.
  + Many other fixes and improvements.
- Pass --with-config-dns-rc-manager-default=netconfig to configure:
  ensure to use netconfig, which is SUSE's default.
- Replace pgkconfig(systemd) BuildRequires with
  pkgconfig(libsystemd), following upstream.

  + Updated translations.
- Changes from version 1.1.92:
  + Added an option to enable the old-fashioned /etc/resolv.conf
    handling (using a symlink).
  + NetworkManager now checks the connection data from client for
    validity and gracefully handles unknown properties in client.
    This improves interoperability between the server and clients
    of different versions.
  + The activation of a VLAN device with a virtual parent that is
    inactive now results in a parent being activated first.
  + The server name used with 802.1x authentication can now be
    constrained to a particular domain suffix (CVE-2006-7246).
- Drop (presumably) no longer needed patches:

    property.
  + Fixed a race condition that could potentially lead to
    unauthorized access to connection secrets (CVE-2016-0764).
  + dnsmasq configuration for shared connections can now be
    extended by placing custom files in
    /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq-shared.d/.
  + Generic devices are no longer assumed unless explicitly
    requested by user.
  + The reorder-header VLAN flag setting is now honored; to keep
    backwards compatibility in behavior, an existing REORDER_HDR=0
    ifcfg-rh key is ignored; the flag must be disabled with
    VLAN_FLAGS=NO_REORDER_HDR.
  + Fair amount of bugs was fixed and robustness was generally
    improved.
- Rebase systemd-network-config.patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 19 09:29:33 UTC 2016 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.1.90:
  + Added an option to enable use of random MAC addresses for Wi-Fi
    access point scanning (defaults to disabled).  Controlled with
    'wifi.mac-address-randomization' property
    (MAC_ADDRESS_RANDOMIZATION key in ifcfg files).
  + Wi-Fi scanning now utilizes wpa_supplicant's AP list.
  + Added support for Wi-Fi powersave, configured with POWERSAVE
    key in ifcfg files.
  + Added support for creation of more types of software devices:
    tun & tap, maxvlan, vxlan and ip tunnels (ipip, gre, sit,
    isatap, vti, ip6ip6, ipip6, ip6gre and vti6).
  + The software devices (bond, bridge, vlan, team, ...) can now be
    stacked arbitrarily. The nmcli interface for creating
    master-slave relationships has been significantly improved by
    the use of 'master' argument to all link types.
  + RFC7217 stable privacy addressing is now used by default to
    protect from address-based host tracking. The IPv6 addressing
    mode is configured with IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE key in ifcfg files.
  + Improved route management code to avoid clashes between
    conflicting routes in multiple connections.
  + Refactored platform code resulting in more robust interface to
    platform, less overhead and reduced memory footprint.
  + Improved interoperability with other network management tools.
    The externally created software devices are not managed until
    they're activated.
  + The Device instances now exist for all software connections and
    the platform devices are now only created when the device is
    activated. This makes it possible for connections with device
    of same name not to clash unless they're activated
    concurrently. The links are now not unnecessarily present
    unless the connection is active, avoiding pollution of the link
    name space.
  + NetworkManager now correctly manages connectivity in
    namespace-based containers such as LXC and Docker.
  + Support for configuring ethernet Wake-On-Lan has been added.
  + Added LLDP listener functionality and related CLI client
    commands. Enabled via LLDP option in ifcfg files.
  + CLI secret agent has been extended with support for VPN
    secrets.
  + The command line client now utilizes colors for its output.
  + The command line client now sorts the devices and properties
    for better clarity.
  + Numerous impovement to Bash command completion for nmcli.
  + NetworkManager relies on less external libraries. The use of
    dbus-glib has been replaced with gio's native D-Bus support and
    libnl-route is no longer used.
  + Dependency on avahi-autoipd has been dropped. Native IPv4
    link-local addressing configuration based on systemd network
    library is now used instead.
  + Hostname is now managed via systemd-hostnamed on systemd-based
    systems.
  + Management of resolv.conf management can be changed at runtime,
    private resolv.conf is always written in /run.
  + DNS options in resolv.conf are now honored.
  + Updated version of systemd network library used for internal
    DHCP and IPv4 link-local support.
  + Support for event logging via audit subsystem has been added.
  + Support for native logging via systemd-journald has been added
    taking advantage of its structured logging.
  + Live reconfiguration in IP configuration after changing the
    settings without reactivation of the device with "nmcli device
    reapply" command and via D-Bus API.
  + The API for VPN plugins now supports multiple simultaneous
    connections. Most popular VPN plugins have been updated to
    support this functionality.
  + The libnm library now provides API to access VPN service
    definitions.
  + Fair amount of bugs was fixed and robustness was generally
    improved.
  + New DHCP_FQDN key in ifcfg files to configure the full FQDN to
    be sent to the DHCP servers.
  + Added multicast_snooping option to BRIDGING_OPTS ifcfg key.
- Pass --enable-gtk-doc to configure: needed to have the man pages
  built.

Sat Apr  2 14:57:56 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

_ Update to version 1.0.12:
  + DHCP leases on software devices are now renewed when the
    computer is awoken from suspend.
  + Improved ifupdown plugin robustness and interoperability on
    Yocto and OpenEmbedded.
  + Fixed failed VPN activations when plugin supports interactive
    mode, but the VPN daemon does not.
  + Wi-Fi monitor interfaces are now ignored, not turned into
    managed mode.
  + AP and AdHoc mode connections with manual IP configuration are
    now able to autoconnect.
  + Broken device drivers (AWS ENI) that initially have invalid
    MAC addresses are now properly managed as soon as correct MAC
    address is set.
  + WWAN devices are unlocked a bit earlier so that supported IP
    versions can be queried.
  + The NetworkManager.service was ordered after
    network-pre.target and dbus.service. This ensures
    NetworkManager doesn't set up connectivity before firewall
    rules are in place and wouldn't exit before remote filesystems
    can be umounted ensuring orderly operation of systemd managed
    installations.
  + The netfilter rules used with shared IPv4 method are now
    removed on exit.
  + Ability to manage USB gadget drivers (UDC side) has beed
    added.
  + Infiniband transport mode change now takes place with the link
    set down because some drivers need that.
  + Race conditions that could disclose connection secrets to
    authenticated local users when changing ifcfg and keyfile
    connections have been fixed.  This has security impact of low
    severity (CVE-2016-0764).
  + A handful of memory leak and crasher bugs of minor importance
    have been fixed.

  + MTU indicated by a VPN gateway is now properly applied.
  + Fixed MSS setting when MTU changes.
  + The default route is properly restored on device disconnect.
  + Build with older toolchains has been fixed.
  + The team devices can now properly be enslaved to bridges.
  + Failed DHCP attempts for assumed connections are now retried

  + Support for Bluetooth DUN devices with Bluez 5 has been fixed.
  + The ipv6.ignore-auto-dns property is now properly honored
    making it possible to override automatically obtained name
    servers.
  + Invalid permanent MAC adddresses as reported by some devices

  %{_udevdir}.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 15 11:45:18 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.4:
  + The MTU setting from an IPv6 neighbor discovery Router
    Advertisements is now ignored if applying it would result in
    invalid configuration.
  + Some configuration options can now be changed without
    restarting the daemon. Notably, this applies to 'dns',
    'connectivity' and 'ignore-carrier' settings.
  + The connection activation was made more robust. If an active
    connection is reactivated, the device it's active on takes
    precedence. If an attempt is made to activate a connection on a
    different device than it is active on, the activation proceeds
    removing the connection from the active device.
  + The device specifiers in configuration files now support
    negation via 'except:' match.
  + Devices that only have IPv6 link-local address are no longer
    assumed to be connected.
  + nmcli now provides hints and tab-completion for enumeration
    properties.
  + If the IPv6 interface tokens are set they are honored when
    creating an interface identifier for IPv6 addressing.
  + NetworkManager now maintains correct routing configuration when
    multiple interfaces are connected to the same network.
  + The management of devices can now be controlled with udev
    rules. The veth devices as well as the virtual Ethernet devices
    of various virtualization tools (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels
    Workstation) are now ignored by default.
  + The IPv6 privacy extensions are now enabled by default and
    handling of the ip6-privacy sysctl has been improved.
  + Activating a Bond, Bridge or Team device can now optionally
    activate the slave connections as well. The behavior is
    controlled with 'connection.autoconnect-slaves' property.
  + The platform support code has been refactored, resulting in
    better scalability in large configurations.
  + Changes to network interfaces configuration done outside
    NetworkManager are now picked up and exposed to the user via
    NetworkManager API and tools.
  + A connection can now optionally leave externally configured
    default route in place instead of overriding it. The behavior
    is controlled with 'ipv4.never-default' and
    'ipv6.never-default' properties.
  + Multiple crasher and memory leak bugs in the daemon were fixed.
  + Multiple bugs that could cause the client tools to hang or
    crash were fixed.
  + nmcli allows multiple devices for 'nmcli device
    disconnect/delete'.
  + Firewall zone is added to firewalld for device-based VPN
    connections too.
- Toggle with_cacert_patch to 0: the Radius CA patch neeeds to be
  reworked. Wrap applying the patch into a with_cacert_patch
  condition, to make enabling/disabling a one-stop change.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 07:58:33 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0.2:
  + Wi-Fi devices now indicate support for 2GHz and 5GHz
    frequencies.
  + "nmcli device" output now indicates physical port ID
  + New config items added to the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin:
    - IPV4_ROUTE_METRIC and IPV6_ROUTE_METRIC.
    - DEVTIMEOUT.
    - IPADDR and PREFIX are now supported for specifying address
      ranges of shared IPv4 connections.
  + Dispatcher scripts now get a CONNECTION_FILENAME variable with
    the path to the configuration file for the connection.
  + An example dispatcher script that is able to apply complex
    routing rules (such as setting up policy-based routing) for
    'ifcfg-rh' connections was added to examples/dispatcher/.
  + 'mode' key of Bond device options property now accepts numeric
    values.
  + Connection attempts for devices without carrier on startup now
    wait for carrier to appear within a short timeout instead of
    failing immediately. This makes system startup more robust.
  + Bridge connectivity is now properly restored on resume from
    suspend.
  + The D-Bus name is acquired earlier during the daemon startup.
    This makes it possible for the systemd service manager to
    optimize the service startup so that services that require
    networking are activated sooner contributing to faster system
    start up time.
  + A lot of memory leak problems were fixed, resulting in reduced
    memory usage. Many of them were discovered as a result of
    improvements in use of Valgrind in the testing infrastructure.
  + Management of 'teamd' daemon instances for Team devices is now
    more robust.
  + The 'dnsmasq' daemon respawns when it terminates and it is
    configured for management of DNS resolver configuration.
  + Hostnames that are not fully qualified are no longer sent to a
    DHCPv6 server for a dynamic DNS update.
  + Connection UUIDs are now checked for uniqueness when connection
    configurations are read.
  + Receipt of a NDP Router Advertisement can no longer lower the
    IPv6 hop limit (CVE-2015-2924).
  + Many other bugs were fixed.
  + Updated translations.

  providers). It is not strictly required to operate NM in most
  setups, thus only recommended (boo#903553).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jan 27 10:15:18 UTC 2015 - dimstar@opensuse.org

- Update to version 1.0:
  + A new 'libnm' GObject-based client library to replace
    libnm-util/libnm-glib:
    - IP address, IP route, hardware address, and other properties
      are now represented as strings.
    - Based on GIO's GDBus bindings instead of dbus-glib.
    - Uses modern GObject APIs including GAsyncResult and GVariant.
    - See https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/libnm.
  + Devices and VPN connections now have individual default routes.
    Priorities are handled through configurable route metrics.
  + nmcli now supports password requests and PolicyKit
    authorizations.
  + A faster, lighter-weight (though less capable) internal DHCP
    client has been added and may be selected with the
    "dhcp=internal" option. It supports fewer DHCP options and
    does not yet support DHCPv6.
  + A new 'configure-and-quit=yes' option has been added for
    environments with less dynamic network configuration.
  + When running on 3.17 and later kernels, NetworkManager handles
    IPv6LL address assignment to ensure that IPv6 connectivity is
    not enabled until intentionally configured by the user.
  + NetworkManager no longer causes the nl80211 kernel module to be
    loaded on systems with no Wi-Fi devices.
  + Bluetooth DUN support now works with Bluez 5.x.
  + VPN connections can now persist across link changes and
    suspend/resume if their VPN plugin supports this feature.
  + A new 'ibft' settings plugin has been added to support
    firmware-based iBFT/iSCSI configurations. This functionality
    has been moved to 'ibft' from the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin.
  + IPv6 router advertisement MTUs are now respected.
  + NetworkManager no longer requires polkit libraries at runtime
    when Polkit support is enabled, and Polkit can be disabled at
    build time too.
  + Automatically created connections are now deleted when their
    device goes away.
  + 'nmcli dev connect' now attemts to create a connection if none
    exists.
  + Manually configured static IPv6 configuration is kept even if
    SLAAC fails.
  + Manpages for the 'keyfile' and 'ifcfg-rh' plugins now describe
    their configuration syntax and available options.
  + WWAN connections now support IPv6 if the modem and provider
    support IPv6.
  + Software devices (bridge, bond, team, etc) can now be deleted
    from the D-Bus API or with nmcli.
  + The manpages, documentation, and API annotations have received
    many cleanups.
  + Externally created virtual interfaces are no longer managed by
    NetworkManager until they are set "up" or activated via nmcli.
- Disable nm-probe-radius-server-cert.patch for now: needs rebase.
- Drop 0001-core-don-t-auto-launch-logind-bgo-741572.patch and
  NetworkManager-dhcpv6.patch: fixed upstream.
- Split out new subpackage typelib-1_0-NM-1_0 and libnm0.
- Require typelib-1_0-NM-1_0 and libnm0 by the -devel package.
- Add pkgconfig(bluez) BuildRequires.
- Replace pkgconfig(libsystemd-login) BuildRequires with
  pkgconfig(libsystemd) and pkgconfig(polkit-gobject-1) with
  pkgconfig(polkit-agent-1), following upstream.

    with detailed help and tab completion support.
  + nmcli bash completion has been greatly improved.
  + Added support for Data Center Bridging (DCB) and FibreChannel
    over Ethernet (FCoE).
  + IPv6 autoconfiguration is now done in userspace with libndp
    instead of the kernel.
  + The D-Bus daemon is no longer required for root-only operation.
  + WiFi, ADSL, WWAN, and Bluetooth are now optional plugins,
    reducing install size.
  + Added support for Infiniband Partitions.

    "nmcli con reload" to notice changes made externally or set
    "monitor-connection-files=true" in NetworkManager.conf's
    [main] section.
  + Connections can now be locked to interface names in addition to
    hardware/MAC addresses.
  + A new "ignore-carrier" configuration option is available to
    ignore the carrier on selected interfaces.
  + A new "dns=none" option has been added to suppress changes to
    /etc/resolv.conf.
  + Changes made to IP addresses, IP routes, and master/slave
    relationships from external tools are now recognized and
    reflected in the D-Bus API.
  + Assuming the existing configuration of interfaces without
    changing that configuration is now more reliable.
  + The 'root' user is no longer subject to PolicyKit access
    controls and usage of D-Bus "at_console" permissions has been
    removed.
  + Configuration file snippets can be dropped in
    /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d to change smaller sets of
    configuration options.
  + Added IP-level support for more software/virtual interfaces
    types including GRE, macvlan, macvtap, tun, tap, veth, and
    vxlan interfaces.
  + All network interfaces known to the kernel are now exposed
    through the D-Bus interface.

    openswan/libreswan/strongswan.
  + Added support for "temporary" connections which are not saved
    to disk until requested.
  + Added WWAN autoconnect support and fixed issues with airplane
    mode handling.
  + NetworkManager-wait-online systemd service behavior is more
    reliable.
  + The dispatcher timeout has increased to 10 minutes, and new
    "pre-up" and "pre-down" events have been added which block
    activation until complete.
  + NetworkManager no longer prevents Wake-on-LAN functionality
    from working.
  + PPPoE now requires userland "rp-pppoe" to work around kernel
    bugs with that prevent detecting server-side termination of the
    PPP link.
  + An ARP announcement is now sent after IPv4 addresses are
    configured.
  + Added a DNS plugin for dnssec-trigger for better DNSSEC
    operation.
  + More properties are now exposed via the D-Bus properties
    interface in addition to getter/setter functions.
  + Added support for custom IP address ranges for Shared
    connections.
  + Fatal connection failures now block automatic reconnection more
    reliably.
  + VPN connection IP details are now available via the D-Bus
    interface.
  + VPN plugins can now request additional/new secrets from the
    user during the connection process.
  + 'veth' interfaces are now unmanaged by default to cooperate
    better with external tools.
