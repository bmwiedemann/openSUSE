  <title>Internet Protocol Suite Java Library</title>
  <description>NetComponents is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally
developed by ORO, Inc.	This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP,
Telnet, POP3, FTP, NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like
Time and Echo as well as BSD R command support.  The purpose of the
library is to provide fundamental protocol access, not higher-level
abstractions.  Therefore, some of the design violates object-oriented
design principles.  Its philosophy is to make the global functionality
of a protocal accesible (for example, TFTP send file and receive file)
when possible, but also provide access to the fundamental protocols
where applicable so that the programmer can construct custom
implementations (for example, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP
packet send and receive methods are exposed).</description>
