%description
Visually, NsCDE mimics CDE, the well known Common Desktop Environment of
many commercial UNIX systems of the nineties. It supports CDE backdrops and
palettes with FVWM colorsets and has a theme generator for Xt, Xaw, Motif,
GTK2, GTK3, Qt4 and Qt5.

Integrating all these bits and pieces, the user gets a retro visual experience
across almost all X11 applications. Enriched with a bunch of powerful
FVWM concepts and functions, modern applications and font rendering,
NsCDE acts as a link between classic CDE look and a fast and
extensible environment, well suited for modern day computing.
