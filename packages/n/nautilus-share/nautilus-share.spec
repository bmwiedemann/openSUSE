%description
An application for the GNOME desktop integrated into Nautilus
which allows use of Nautilus shares without signing in as root.

Features:

* A new command in the Nautilus context menu
  (Menu key or right click).

* A dialog to share a directory, which allows choosing a
  name and decide on read-only/read-write status.

* Possibility to access the share settings from the Properties
  tab of a directory.

* Possibility to examine whether a share name already exists by
  typing it.

* Nautilus displays a palm icon to visually show which
  directories are shared.
