  <title>NGINX module for Brotli compression</title>
  <description>Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data
using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding
and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best
currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed
with deflate but offers more dense compression.

ngx_brotli is a set of two nginx modules:

ngx_brotli filter module - used to compress responses on-the-fly,
ngx_brotli static module - used to serve pre-compressed files.
