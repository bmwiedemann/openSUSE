- New upstream release 4.3.3

FEATURES:
- Follow DNS flag day 2020 advice and
  set default EDNS message size to 1232.
- Merged PR #113 with fixes.  Instead of listing an IP-address to
  listen on, an interface name can be specified in nsd.conf, with
  ip-address: eth0.  The IP-addresses for that interface are then used.
- Port TSIG code for openssl 3.0.0-alpha6.

BUG FIXES:
- Fix make install with --with-pidfile="".
- Merge #115 from millert: Fix strlcpy() usage. From OpenBSD.
- Merge #117: mini_event.h (4.3.2 and 4.3.1) on OpenBSD cannot find
  fd_set - patch.
- Fix that configure checks for EVP_sha256 to detect openssl, because
  HMAC_CTX_new is deprecated in 3.0.0.
- Fix #119: fix compile warnings from new gcc.
- Fix #119: warn when trying to parse a directory.
- Merge PR #121: Increase log level of recreated database from
  WARNING to ERR.
- Remove unused space from LIBS on link line.
- Updated date in nsd -v output.

    - PR #12: send-buffer-size, receive-buffer-size,
      tcp-reject-overflow options for nsd.conf, from Jeroen Koekkoek.
    - Fix #14, tcp connections have 1/10 to be active and have to work
      every second, and then they get time to complete during a reload,
      this is a process that lingers with the old version during a version
      update.

  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix #13: Stray dot at the end of some log entries, removes dot
      after updated serial number in log entry.
    - Fix TLS cipher selection, the previous was redundant, prefers
      CHACHA20-POLY1305 over AESGCM and was not as readable as it
      could be.
    - Consolidate server tls context create and remote control context
      create, with hardening for the remote control tls context too.
    - Fix to init event structure for reassignment.

      values from setting event library lists and assertions, that would
      sometimes also show after event_del.

      available, for accept4.

      queries over UDP to be further moved to TCP as well.
      Also no additional section processig for type ANY, reducing
      the response size.
    - Fix #4215: on-the-fly change of TSIG keys with patch from Igor, adds
      nsd-control print_tsig, update_tsig, add_tsig, assoc_tsig

      last after restart.

      sorted and in a predictable order.

Wed Jun 29 01:11:13 UTC 2016 - mrueckert@suse.de

- update to 4.1.10

      option for Linux, binds to interfaces and addresses that are
      down.
    - NSD includes AAAA before A for queries over IPV6 (in
      delegations).  And TC is set if no glue can be provided with
      a delegation because of packet size.

      queries.

      nonterminals, the answer for that domain gets closest
      encloser.

      kernels.
