    - PR #12: send-buffer-size, receive-buffer-size,
      tcp-reject-overflow options for nsd.conf, from Jeroen Koekkoek.
    - Fix #14, tcp connections have 1/10 to be active and have to work
      every second, and then they get time to complete during a reload,
      this is a process that lingers with the old version during a version
      update.

  * BUG FIXES:
    - Fix #13: Stray dot at the end of some log entries, removes dot
      after updated serial number in log entry.

      could be.
    - Consolidate server tls context create and remote control context
      create, with hardening for the remote control tls context too.
    - Fix to init event structure for reassignment.

      the response size.
    - Fix #4215: on-the-fly change of TSIG keys with patch from Igor, adds
      nsd-control print_tsig, update_tsig, add_tsig, assoc_tsig

      sorted and in a predictable order.
