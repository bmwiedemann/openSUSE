# It is probably best to not work as user root and redirect all
# email to "root" to the address of a HUMAN who deals with this
# system's problems. Then you don't have to check for important
# email too often on the root account.
# The "\root" will make sure that email is also delivered to the
# root-account, but also forwared to the user "joe".
