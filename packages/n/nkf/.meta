  <title>Network Kanji Code Conversion Filter</title>
  <description>Nkf is a yet another Kanji code converter among networks, hosts, and
terminals. It converts input Kanji code to designated Kanji code, such
as 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS) or EUC.

One of the most unique facility of nkf is the guess of the input kanji
code.  It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS), and 
EUC. So users do not need the input Kanji code specification.

By  default,  X0201  kana is converted into X0208 kana. For X0201 kana,
SO/SI, SSO and ESC-(-I methods are  supported. For automatic code
detection, nkf assumes no X0201 kana in MS-Kanji. To accept X0201 in
MS-Kanji, use -X, -x, or -S.</description>
