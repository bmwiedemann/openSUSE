-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 17 07:36:18 UTC 2024 - Michal Vyskocil <mvyskocil@opensuse.org>

- Update to 0.10.0
- Packaging changes:
  - remove %check as it depends on a lua code bump now
  - bump vterm and other dependencies to match upstream
- Breaking changes:
  - nvim_open_win() now blocks all autocommands when noautocmd is set, rather
    than just those from setting the buffer to display in the window.
- Defaults:
  - Default color scheme has been updated to be "Nvim branded" and accessible.
    Use :colorscheme vim to revert to the old legacy color scheme.
  These Nvim specific highlight groups are now defined in a meaningfully
    different way and might need an update:
    - hl-FloatBorder is linked to hl-NormalFloat instead of hl-WinSeparator.
    - hl-NormalFloat is not linked to hl-Pmenu.
    - hl-WinBar has different background.
    - hl-WinBarNC is similar to hl-WinBar but not bold.
    - hl-WinSeparator is linked to hl-Normal instead of hl-VertSplit.
  - This also might result into some color schemes looking differently due to them
    relying on implicit assumptions about how highlight groups are defined by
    default. To account for this, define all attributes of highlight groups
    explicitly. Alternatively, use :colorscheme vim or :source
    $VIMRUNTIME/colors/vim.lua to restore previous definitions.
  - 'termguicolors' is enabled by default when Nvim is able to determine that
    the host terminal emulator supports 24-bit color. 
- Editor:
  - When switching windows, CursorMoved autocommands trigger when Nvim is back on
    the main loop rather than immediately. This is more compatible with Vim.
  - "#" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start of
    the lhs of a mapping.
  - shm-q now fully hides macro recording message instead of only shortening it.
  - Signs placed through the legacy sign-commands are now stored and displayed
    as extmarks internally. Along with the following changes:
  - A sign placed twice in the same group with the same identifier will be moved.
  - Legacy signs are always deleted along with the line it is placed on.
  - Legacy and extmark signs will show up in both :sign-place-list and
    nvim_buf_get_extmarks().
  - Legacy and extmark signs are displayed and listed with the same priority:
    line number -> priority -> sign id -> recently placed
  - :behave was removed. If you used :behave xterm, the following is equivalent:
    set mousemodel=extend
  - If you used :behave mswin, the following is equivalent:
    set selection=exclusive
    set selectmode=mouse,key
    set mousemodel=popup
    set keymodel=startsel,stopsel
- Events:
  - Returning any truthy value from a callback passed to nvim_create_autocmd()
    (rather than just true) will delete the autocommand.
- LSP:
  - LanguageTree:parse() will no longer parse injections by default and now
    requires an explicit range argument to be passed. If injections are required,
    provide an explicit range via parser:parse({ start_row, end_row }).
    vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet() will now strictly follow the snippet grammar
    defined by LSP, and hence previously parsed snippets might now be considered
    invalid input.
  - vim.lsp.codelens.refresh() now takes an opts argument. With this change,
    the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has been replaced by
    refreshing all buffers.
  - vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items() will no longer return reliable results,
    since it does not apply itemDefaults when its input is a CompletionList.
    Moreover, since support for LSP completionList.itemDefaults was added, some
    third party plugins might be negatively impacted in case the language servers
    support the feature but the plugin does not. If necessary, the respective
    capability can be removed when calling
    vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities().
  - LspRequest and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to LspProgress) autocmds were
    promoted from User autocmds to first class citizens.
- Lua:
  - -l ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and
    doesn't cause Nvim to exit.
  - Removed functions from the vim.json module:
  - Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.
  - vim.json.null is redundant with vim.NIL.
  - vim.json.array_mt (and related) is redundant with vim.empty_dict().
  - vim.islist() now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e., has
    integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous behavior (only
    check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1), use vim.isarray().
  - Renamed vim.treesitter.playground to vim.treesitter.dev.
- Options:
  - Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:
  - 'backspace' no longer supports number values. Instead:
  - for backspace=0 set backspace= (empty)
  - for backspace=1 set backspace=indent,eol
  - for backspace=2 set backspace=indent,eol,start (default behavior in Nvim)
  - for backspace=3 set backspace=indent,eol,nostop
  - 'backupdir' and 'directory' will no longer remove a > at the start of the option.
  - OptionSet autocommand args v:option_new, v:option_old, v:option_oldlocal,
    v:option_oldglobal now have the type of the option instead of always being
    strings. v:option_old is now the old global value for all global-local options,
    instead of just string global-local options.
  - Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when the
    option is set (e.g. using :set or nvim_set_option_value()) without a scope,
    which means they now behave the same way as string options.
- Plugins:
  - :TOhtml has been rewritten in Lua to support Nvim-specific decorations, and
    many options have been removed.
  - Treesitter:
  - Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with
    upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The full
    list is documented in treesitter-highlight-groups.
- TUI:
  - In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim TUI used to blink even without
    configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in cursor-blinking. This was a bug that
    has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the following (or
    similar, adapted to user preference) to your config file:
    set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500
- NEW FEATURES
- API:
  - Passing 0 to nvim_get_chan_info() gets info about the current channel.
  - nvim_buf_set_extmark() supports inline virtual text.
  - nvim_win_text_height() computes the number of screen lines occupied by a
    range of text in a given window.
  - New RPC client type msgpack-rpc is added for nvim_set_client_info() to
    support fully MessagePack-RPC compliant clients.
  - Floating windows can now be hidden by setting hide in nvim_open_win() or
    nvim_win_set_config().
  - nvim_input_mouse() supports mouse buttons "x1" and "x2".
  - Added "force_crlf" option field in nvim_open_term().
  - Added nvim_tabpage_set_win() to set the current window of a tabpage.
  - nvim__win_add_ns() can bind a namespace to a window-local scope(s).
  - Extmarks opt-in to this scoping via the scoped flag of nvim_buf_set_extmark().
  - Mapping APIs now support abbreviations when mode short-name has suffix "a".
  - Floating windows can now show footer with new footer and footer_pos config
    fields. Uses hl-FloatFooter by default.
  - extmarks can set a "url" highlight attribute, so the text region can become
    a clickable hyperlink (assuming UI support). The TUI renders URLs using the OSC
    8 control sequence, enabling clickable text in supporting terminals.
  - nvim_open_win() and nvim_win_set_config() now support opening normal
    (split) windows, moving floating windows into split windows, and opening
    windows in non-current tabpages.
  - Flags added to nvim_buf_set_extmark():
  - "undo_restore": opt-out extmarks of precise undo tracking.
  - "invalidate": automatically hide or delete extmarks.
  - "virt_text_repeat_linebreak": repeat virtual text on wrapped lines.
  - Extmarks now fully support multi-line ranges, and a single extmark can be
    used to highlight a range of arbitrary length. The nvim_buf_set_extmark() API
    function already allowed you to define such ranges, but highlight regions were
    not rendered consistently for a range that covers more than one line break.
    This has now been fixed. Signs defined as part of a multi-line extmark also
    apply to every line in the range, not just the first. In addition,
    nvim_buf_get_extmarks() has gained an "overlap" option to return such ranges
    even if they started before the specified position.
- Defaults:
  - The workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles LSP client capability is now enabled by
    default on Mac and Windows. Disabled on Linux since there currently isn't a
    viable backend for watching files that scales well for large directories.
  - On Windows 'isfname' does not include ":". Drive letters are handled
    correctly without it. (Use gF for filepaths suffixed with ":line:col").
  - 'comments' includes "fb:•".
  - 'shortmess' includes the "C" flag.
  - 'grepprg' uses the -H and -I flags for grep by default, and defaults to
    using ripgrep if available.
  - "]d" and "[d" in Normal mode map to vim.diagnostic.goto_next() and
    vim.diagnostic.goto_prev(), respectively. ]d-default [d-default <C-W>d (and
    <C-W><C-D>) map to vim.diagnostic.open_float() CTRL-W_d-default
    vim.lsp.start() sets the following default keymaps (assuming server support):
  - K in Normal mode maps to vim.lsp.buf.hover(), unless 'keywordprg' was
    customized before calling vim.lsp.start().
  - Automatic linting of treesitter query files (see ft-query-plugin). Can be
    disabled via:
    vim.g.query_lint_on = {}
- Enabled treesitter highlighting for:
  - Treesitter query files
  - Vim help files
  - Lua files
- Editor:
  - Better cmdline completion for string option value. complete-set-option
    Try it with :set listchars=<Tab>
  -  By default, the swapfile "ATTENTION" E325 dialog is skipped if the
    swapfile is owned by a running Nvim process, instead of prompting. If you
    always want the swapfile dialog, delete the default SwapExists handler:
    autocmd! nvim_swapfile. default-autocmds
  - Navigating the jumplist with CTRL+O, CTRL+I behaves more intuitively when
    deleting buffers, and avoids "invalid buffer" cases. #25461
  - :fclose command.
  - v_Q-default and v_@-default repeat a register for each line of a linewise
    visual selection.
  - Clicking on a tabpage in the tabline with the middle mouse button closes it.
  - :checkhealth buffer can be opened in a split window using modifiers like
    :vertical, :horizontal and :botright.
- Events:
  - vim.on_key() callbacks receive a second argument for keys typed before
    mappings are applied.
- LSP:
  - LSP method names are available in vim.lsp.protocol.Methods.
  - Implemented LSP inlay hints: lsp-inlay_hint
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint
  - Implemented pull diagnostic textDocument/diagnostic:
    vim.lsp.diagnostic.on_diagnostic()
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_diagnostic
  - Implemented LSP type hierarchy: vim.lsp.buf.typehierarchy()
    https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification/#textDocument_prepareTypeHierarchy
  - vim.lsp.status() consumes the last progress messages as a string.
  - LSP client now always saves and restores named buffer marks when applying text edits.
  - LSP client now supports the positionEncoding server capability. If a server
    responds with the positionEncoding capability in its initialization response,
    Nvim automatically sets the client's offset_encoding field.
  - Dynamic registration of LSP capabilities. An implication of this change is
    that checking a client's server_capabilities is no longer a sufficient
    indicator to see if a server supports a feature. Instead use
    client.supports_method(<method>). It considers both the dynamic capabilities
    and static server_capabilities.
  - anchor_bias option to lsp-handlers aids in positioning of floating windows.
  - vim.lsp.util.locations_to_items() sets the user_data of each item to the
    original LSP Location or LocationLink.
  - Added support for connecting to servers using named pipes (Windows) or Unix
    domain sockets (Unix) via vim.lsp.rpc.connect().
  - Added support for completionList.itemDefaults, reducing overhead when
    computing completion items where properties often share the same value (e.g.
    commitCharacters). Note that this might affect plugins and language servers
    that don't support the feature, and in such cases the respective capability can
    be unset.
  - vim.lsp.start() accepts a "silent" option for suppressing messages if an
    LSP server failed to start.
  - vim.lsp.buf.definition(), vim.lsp.buf.declaration(),
    vim.lsp.buf.type_definition(), and vim.lsp.buf.implementation() now support the
    loclist field of vim.lsp.ListOpts.
- Lua:
  - :lua with a [range] executes that range as Lua code, in any buffer.
  - :source without arguments treats a buffer with 'filetype' of "lua" as Lua
    code regardless of its extension.
  - Vimscript function exists() supports checking v:lua functions.
  - vim.iter() is a generic interface for all iterable objects (tables, iterators).
  - vim.snippet provides a mode for expanding and navigating snippets.
  - vim.ringbuf() is a generic ring buffer (data structure).
  - vim.deepcopy() gained a noref argument to avoid hashing table values.
  - vim.keycode() translates keycodes in a string.
  - vim.system() runs commands / starts processes.
  - vim.lpeg and vim.re expose the bundled Lpeg expression grammar parser and
    its regex interface.
  - vim.base64.encode() and vim.base64.decode() encode and decode strings using
    Base64 encoding.
  - vim.text.hexencode() and vim.text.hexdecode() convert strings to and from
    byte representations.
  - vim.ui.open() opens URIs using the system default handler (macOS open,
    Windows explorer, Linux xdg-open, etc.)
  - vim.wo can now be double indexed for :setlocal behaviour. Currently only 0
    for the buffer index is supported.
  - Improved messages for type errors in vim.api.* calls (including opts
    params).
  - Lua type annotations for:
    vim.*
    vim.fn.*
    vim.api.*
    vim.v.*
  - Functions that take a severity as an optional parameter (e.g.
    vim.diagnostic.get()) now also accept a list of severities
    vim.diagnostic.severity
  - vim.diagnostic.count() returns the number of diagnostics for a given buffer
    and/or namespace, by severity. This is a faster alternative to
    vim.diagnostic.get() when only the number of diagnostics is needed, but not the
    diagnostics themselves.
  - vim.diagnostic.is_enabled()
  - vim.version.le(), vim.version.ge()
  - vim.fs.root() finds project root directories from a list of "root markers".
  - vim.tbl_contains() now works for general tables and allows specifying a
    predicate function that is checked for each value. (Use vim.list_contains() for
    checking list-like tables (integer keys without gaps) for literal values.)
  - vim.region() can use a string accepted by getpos() as position.
- Options:
  - 'winfixbuf' keeps a window focused onto a specific buffer
  - 'smoothscroll' option to scroll by screen line rather than by text line
    when 'wrap' is set.
  - 'foldtext' now supports virtual text format. fold-foldtext
  - 'foldtext' can be set to an empty string to disable and render the line: as
    normal with regular highlighting and no line wrapping.
  - 'complete' option supports "f" flag for completing buffer names.
  - 'completeopt' option supports "popup" flag to show extra information in a
    floating window.
  - 'errorfile' (-q) accepts - as an alias for stdin.
  - Performance:
  - 'diffopt' "linematch" scoring algorithm now favours larger and less groups
    https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/23611
  - Treesitter highlighting now parses injections incrementally during screen
    redraws only for the line range being rendered. This significantly improves
    performance in large files with many injections.
  - 'breakindent' performance is significantly improved for wrapped lines.
  - Cursor movement, insertion with [count] and screenpos() are now faster.
- Plugins:
  - Nvim now includes commenting support.
  - :Man supports the :hide modifier to open page in the current window.
  - :Man respects 'wrapmargin'
- Startup:
  - $NVIM_APPNAME can be set to a relative path instead of only a name.
  - --startuptime reports startup times for both processes (TUI + server) as
    separate sections.
- Terminal:
  - :terminal accepts some :command-modifiers (specifically :horizontal and
    those that affect splitting a window).
  - Terminal buffers emit a TermRequest autocommand event when the child
    process emits an OSC or DCS control sequence.
  - Terminal buffers respond to OSC background and foreground requests.
    default-autocmds
- Treesitter:
  - Bundled parsers and queries (highlight, folds) for Markdown, Python, and
    Bash.
  - :InspectTree shows root nodes.
  - :InspectTree now supports folding.
  - :InspectTree shows node ranges in 0-based instead of 1-based indexing.
  - vim.treesitter.foldexpr() now recognizes folds captured using a quantified
    query pattern.
  - vim.treesitter.query.omnifunc() provides completion in treesitter query
    files (set by default).
  - vim.treesitter.query.edit() provides live editing of treesitter queries.
  - Query:iter_matches() now has the ability to set the maximum start depth for
    matches.
  - @injection.language now has smarter resolution and will fall back to
    language aliases (e.g., filetype or custom shorthands) registered via
    vim.treesitter.language.register() and/or attempt lower case variants of the
    text.
  - @injection.filename will try to match the node text via
    vim.filetype.match() and treat the result as a language name in the same way as
    @injection.language.
  - The #set! directive supports injection.self and injection.parent for
    injecting either the current node's language or the parent LanguageTree's
    language, respectively.
  - The #set! directive can set the "url" property of a node to have the node
    emit a hyperlink. Hyperlinks are UI specific: in the TUI, the OSC 8 control
    sequence is used.
  - Improved error messages for query parsing.
- TUI:
  - Builtin TUI can now recognize "super" (<D-) and "meta" (<T-) modifiers in a
    terminal emulator that supports tui-csiu.
  - The TermResponse event can be used with v:termresponse to read escape
    sequence responses from the host terminal.
  - A clipboard provider which uses OSC 52 to copy the selection to the system
    clipboard is now bundled by default and will be automatically enabled under
    certain conditions. clipboard-osc52
  - 'termsync' option asks the host terminal to buffer screen updates until the
    redraw cycle is complete. Requires support from the host terminal.
- UI:
  - Enhanced support for rendering multibyte characters using composing
    characters: the maximum limit was increased from 1+6 codepoints to 31 bytes,
    which is guaranteed to fit all chars from before but often more.
  - NOTE: the regexp engine still has a hard-coded limit of considering 6
    composing chars only.
- CHANGED FEATURES: These existing features changed their behavior.
- API:
  - nvim_buf_call() and nvim_win_call() now preserve any return value (NB: not
    multiple return values)
- Editor:
  - gx now uses vim.ui.open() and not netrw. To customize, you can redefine
    vim.ui.open or remap gx. To continue using netrw (deprecated):
   :call netrw#BrowseX(expand(exists("g:netrw_gx") ? g:netrw_gx : '<cfile>'), netrw#CheckIfRemote())<CR>
- LSP:
  - LSP hover and signature help now use Treesitter for highlighting of
    Markdown content. Note that highlighting of code examples requires a matching
    parser and may be affected by custom queries.
  - LspRequest autocmd callbacks contain more information about the LSP request
    status update that occurred.
- Lua:
  - vim.wait() cannot be called in api-fast.
  - vim.diagnostic.config() now accepts virtual text relevant options to
    nvim_buf_set_extmark() (e.g. "virt_text_pos" and "hl_mode") in its
    "virtual_text" table, which gives users more control over how diagnostic
    virtual text is displayed.
  - vim.diagnostic.get() and vim.diagnostic.count() accept multiple namespaces
    rather than just a single namespace.
  - vim.diagnostic.enable() gained new parameters, and the old signature is
    deprecated.
  - vim.diagnostic.config() now accepts a function for the virtual_text.prefix
    option, which allows for rendering e.g., diagnostic severities differently.
- Options:
  - Attempting to set an invalid keycode option (e.g. set t_foo=123) no longer
    gives an error.
- Terminal:
  - Terminal buffers started with no arguments (and use 'shell') close
    automatically if the job exited without error, eliminating the (often unwanted)
    "[Process exited 0]" message. default-autocmds

- Treesitter:
  - Query:iter_matches(), vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate(), and
    vim.treesitter.query.add_directive() accept a new all option which ensures that
    all matching nodes are returned as a table. The default option all=false
    returns only a single node, breaking captures with quantifiers like (comment)+
    @comment; it is only provided for backward compatibility and will be removed
    after Nvim 0.10.
  - vim.treesitter.query.add_predicate() and
    vim.treesitter.query.add_directive() now accept an options table rather than a
    boolean "force" argument. To force a predicate or directive to override an
    existing predicate or directive, use { force = true }.
- REMOVED FEATURES: These deprecated features were removed.
  - Vimball support, including :Vimuntar command
  - Support for legacy treesitter injection queries
  - 'shortmess' flags:
  - shm-f. Always use "(3 of 5)", never "(file 3 of 5)".
  - shm-i. Always use "[noeol]".
  - shm-x. Always use "[dos]", "[unix]" and "[mac]".
  - shm-n. Always use "[New]".
- DEPRECATIONS
 - See https://neovim.io/doc/user/deprecated.html#deprecated-0.10

Thu Sep  7 11:28:17 UTC 2023 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to version 0.9.2:
  - Bram: Nvim is a fork of the Vim editor, created and developed by Bram Moolenaar.
    On August 3, 2023, he passed away at the age of 62. If Vim or Nvim have been of
    use to you in your life, read :help Bram and :help Uganda and consider honoring
    his memory in a way you see fit.
  - Breaking change:
    - An adjustment was made to the grid_line event as part of
      the exernal UI protocol: the cells array might now end with
      a [' ', attr, 0] item with a repeat count of zero. This is
      needed by the TUI to disambiguate final spaces from a line
      from just clearing the line, which will make a difference
      when copying text using the terminal emulators builtin
      primary selection support.
      External UI:s can safely ignore such an empty item and most
      UIs already handle this fine. But it could break UI:s which
      has an assert to validate the cell count to be bigger than
      zero, or similar.
  - Features:
    - tui: Support Super and Meta modifiers
    - terminal: forward more special keys and modifier-mouse
      combinations

Tue Nov 30 18:22:24 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.6.0 (details on
  - Diagnostics and LSP changes
    Initially, diagnostic module is part of vim.lsp module. In
    order to support external plugins such as null-ls.nvim, the
    nvim team has refactor the diagnostic module to its module
    vim.diagnostic. So we need to change our config accordingly.

    vim.lsp.diagnostic.show_line_diagnostics() has been changed
    to vim.diagnostic.open_float(). Previously, there is no easy
    to show diagnostic source unless with some hack, you can now
    show source in diagnostics in open_float() easily:

    vim.diagnostic.open_float(nil, {
        source = 'always'
    })

    vim.lsp.diagnostic.goto_prev() and
    vim.lsp.diagnostic.goto_next() has been renamed to
    vim.diagnostic.goto_prev() and vim.diagnostic.goto_next()
    respectively.

    vim.lsp.diagnostic.set_loclist() and
    vim.lsp.diagnostic.set_qflist() has been renamed to
    vim.diagnostic.setloclist() and vim.diagnostic.setqflist()
    instead.

    Diagnostics signs has been renamed, for example (old –> new):
        LspDiagnosticsSignError –> DiagnosticSignError (Lsp is
            removed, Diagnostics is changed to singular from
            Diagnostic)
        LspDiagnosticsSignWarning –> DiagnosticSignWarn
        LspDiagnosticsSignInformation –> DiagnosticSignInfo
        LspDiagnosticsSignHint –> DiagnosticSignHint

    Also, related highlight has been renamed too:
        DiagnosticsDefaultError –> DiagnosticSignError
        DiagnosticsDefaultWarning –> DiagnosticSignWarn
        DiagnosticsDefaultInformation –> DiagnosticSignInfo
        DiagnosticsDefaultHint –> DiagnosticSignHint

    Now, we can use the following lua snippet to change diagnostic signs:

    vim.fn.sign_define("DiagnosticSignError",
        { text = "✗", texthl = "DiagnosticSignError" })
    vim.fn.sign_define("DiagnosticSignWarn",
        { text = "!", texthl = "DiagnosticSignWarn" })
    vim.fn.sign_define("DiagnosticSignInformation",
        { text = "", texthl = "DiagnosticSignInfo" })
    vim.fn.sign_define("DiagnosticSignHint",
        { text = "", texthl = "DiagnosticSignHint" })

  - Changes to the default
    There are also changes to options and mappings that you might
    be interested.

    Option default value changes:
    - backupdir can now be created automatically and double
      backslash is used, see this commit.
    - option inccommand is set to nosplit
    - set nojoinspaces by default
    
    Mapping changes:
     - <C-L> now defaults to nohlsearch and diffupdate
     - In normal mode, Y is mapped to y$, see this commit, no
       need for nnoremap Y y$ anymore.
- Remove upstreamed patch vim7188-fix-netrw-command.patch.

Sat Jul  3 16:41:13 UTC 2021 - Matej Cepl <mcepl@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.0 (FINALLY!!!):
  This release represents ~4000 commits since v0.4.4, the
  previous non-maintenance release. Highlights include builtin
  support for LSP, new APIs for extended marks (with byte
  resolution tracking of changes) and buffer decorations, as
  well as vast improvements to lua as a plugin and configuration
  language. Experimental support for tree-sitter as a syntax
  engine is also included, building on the new core APIs for byte
  tracking and decorations. There is also very visible shift
  towards using more of Lua.

  The full list of all changes is truly huge, the
  best list is the 0.5.0 commit message on
  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/a5ac2f45ff84.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 29 22:45:13 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 0.1.5:
  * Breaking changes:
    + 'termguicolors' option enables "true color".
       NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR is now ignored.
    + Remove ":oldfiles!", replaced by Vim's ":browse oldfiles".
  * Features:
    + Full :ruby support!
    + timers: timer_start(), timer_stop().
    + :CheckHealth command.
    + file: Add buffered reading and writing.
      Much faster shada file reading (important for startup time).
    + jobstart() learned 'rpc':
      - jobs and RPC channel IDs share the same "namespace".
      - jobstart() can start RPC channels, which allows scripts to
        handle 'stderr' on a RPC channel, like a typical non-RPC
        job.
      - jobpid()/jobstop() works on RPC jobs.
      - Deprecates rpcstart().
    + man.vim rewrite:
      - :Man command is enabled by default.
      - New features: completion, window handling, better parsing,
        and more.
    + capture() function (renamed to execute())
      - Supports nesting, including nested :redir.
    + rplugin manifest: default to XDG dir.
    + Better handling of mouse-clicks on concealed chars.
    + terminal: Ensure b:term_title always has a value.
    + tui: Assume 256 colours in most cases.
    + Always resize the :terminal.
    + api_info().
    + allow setting cwd in jobstart(), termopen().
    + support "special" highlight (undercurl).
    + mouse: Implement horizontal scroll.
  * Fixes:
    + Prevent data loss for process output streams.
    + 'process.c: Fix block in teardown'.
    + Prevent endless loop in printdigraph() (gh#neovim/neovim#5215).
    + timers: Avoid crash after processing events.
    + Set the default value for 'packpath'.
    + Restore double click.
    + readfile(): Less-disruptive readonly check.
      Fixes an issue where nvim unnecessarily "touched" open files.
    + Handle very long $XDG_DATA_DIRS.
    + option: Do not expand options in XDG vars.
    + server_init: Handle server_address_new() failure.
    + Fix v:register for clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus.
    + 'Trigger TabNewEntered with T'.
    + synIDattr(): Return RRGGBB value for fg#.

- Separate locales into neovim-lang.
- Some spec cleanup.
