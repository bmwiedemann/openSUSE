    accepted upstream, but it's needed to support s390x)

Mon Oct 20 12:13:47 UTC 2014 - dmueller@suse.com

- update to 1.18:
  + Replace the basic fprintf call with a call to fwrite
  + Fix ALL the header guards.
  + A new CONTRIBUTING file.
  + leveldb: Remove unused function 'ConsumeChar'.
  + leveldbutil: Remove unused member variables from WriteBatchItemPrinter.
  + Verify checksums of index/meta/filter blocks when paranoid_checks set.
  + Invoke all tools for iOS with xcrun. (This was causing problems with the new XCode 5.1.1 image on pulse.)
  + include only once, and fix the following linter warning: "Found C system header after C++ system header"
  + When encountering a corrupted table file, return Status::Corruption instead of Status::InvalidArgument.
  + Support cygwin as build platform, patch is from https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/issues/detail?id=188
  + Fix typo, merge patch from https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/issues/detail?id=159
  + Fix typos and comments, and address the following two issues:
  + Add missing db synchronize after "fillseq" in the benchmark.
  + Removed unused variable in SeekRandom: value (issue #201)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  7 15:33:22 UTC 2014 - ddiss@suse.com

- updated to 1.16.0
  + Make Log::Reader not report a corruption when the last record in a
    log file is truncated.
  + Fix issue 224: variable created but not utilized.
  + Remove comment that referenced a removed feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb  5 16:14:12 UTC 2014 - ddiss@suse.com

- updated to 1.15.0
  + switched from mmap based writing to simpler stdio based writing. Has
    a minor impact (0.5 microseconds) on microbenchmarks for asynchronous
    writes. Synchronous writes speed up from 30ms to 10ms on linux/ext4.
    Should be much more reliable on diverse platforms.
  + compaction errors now immediately put the database into a read-only
    mode (until it is re-opened). As a downside, a disk going out of
    space and then space being created will require a re-open to recover
    from, whereas previously that would happen automatically. On the
    plus side, many corruption possibilities go away.
  + force the DB to enter an error-state so that all future writes fail
    when a synchronous log write succeeds but the sync fails.
  + repair now regenerates sstables that exhibit problems
  + fix issue 218 - Use native memory barriers on OSX
  + fix issue 212 - QNX build is broken
  + fix build on iOS with xcode 5
  + make tests compile and pass on windows

- refreshed 0001-debian-ports.patch
  + moved OS_MACOSX hunk
