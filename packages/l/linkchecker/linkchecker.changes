  Features:
  - checking: Parse and check links in PDF files.
  - checking: Parse Refresh: and Content-Location: HTTP headers for URLs.

  Changes:

    import needed third party modules.
  - checking: Treat empty URLs as same as parent URL.
    Closes: GH bug #524
  - installation: Replaced the twill dependency with local code.

    the configuration file in the user directory anymore. So a user
    can use this version on a foreign system without leaving any traces
    behind.

  Features:
  - gui: Add Ctrl-L shortcut to highlight the URL input.
  - gui: Support loading and saving of project files.
    Closes: SF bug #3467492

Tue Apr 29 20:43:12 CEST 2008 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 4.9:
  * Parse Shockwave Flash (SWF) for URLs to check
  * Don't parse <script for=""> attributes since they specify IDs,
    not URLs.
  * Fix bash filename completion script:
      - add missing COMPREPLY variable
      - support whitespace in files using "-o filenames" bash completion
        option
      - support subdirs by adding a FileCompleter argument matcher to
        optcomplete.autocomplete()
  * Prevent unicode errors when an email address contains non-ascii
    characters.
  * Workaround for buggy servers that break protocol synchronization of
    persistent HTTP connections.
  * Properly fall back to DNS A requests when no MX host could be found
    for a mailto: URL.
  * Double Ctrl-C aborts checking immediately, without cleanup.
  * Internal patterns now accept URLs with and without "www." prefixes
    as default. This allows sites to check that use both variants.
  * Added --check-html and --check-css options to enable HTML and CSS
    syntax checking. Uses third-party modules "tidy" and "cssutils"
    for the actual check.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  7 13:49:37 CET 2008 - pth@suse.de

- Update to 4.8. Changes since 4.5:
  * Fixed default config file syntax by not indenting comment lines
  * Don't set the URL result on redirections when getting the content.
  * Ignore errors when opening the log file output, and display a warning
    instead.
  * Added some more examples.
  * Pull in changes from Python subversion repository to locally stored
    gzip and httplib modules.
  * Mention in the documentation that --anchors enables logging of
    the anchor warning.
  * Make sure --anchors and --no-warnings play along in the configuration.
  * Check that charset is not None before lowering it in set_encoding().
  * Use standard "utf-8" charset name instead of "utf8" for the XML output
    encoding.
  * Added "created" attribute in XML output root element.
    Added "result" attribute in XML output valid element.
  * Fix printing of unicode names. Thanks to Frank Bennet for the hint.
  * Deprecate gopher: URLs. They do not really exist anymore and the
    gopherlib module in Python 2.5 is deprecated and will vanish soon.
  * Fix message typo for not disclosing information.
  * Always read the request body data on persistent HTTP connections, else
    subsequent calls will get data from the previous request.
  * Zope server workaround: assume missing HEAD support when receiving
    text/plain on a HEAD request. Switch to GET request in this case.
  * Prevent double encoding in HTML info output.
  * Honor urllib.proxy_bypass() when ignoring proxy settings.
    This only affected Windows systems, since on other platforms
    the proxy_bypass() function always return False (on Python <= 2.5
    that is).
  * Document the --configfile option in the man page.
  * Remove comments from CSS content before searching for links.
  * Try to detect unkonwn URL schemes from the command line, eg. URLs
    like "rtsp://foo".
  * Fix typo in warnings and use constants for the warning strings
    to avoid this in the future.
  * Make sure LinkChecker does not check paths that are not prefixed
    with the start URL.
  * Try to solve the "Too many open files" errors that users have
    encountered.
    + Ensure that the connection of a checked URL are closed after checking
      (except for reused connections in the connection pool).
    + Regularly close expired connections from the connection pool, and
      finally close all of them when the program is finished.
    Closes: SF #1758338, SF #1678055, SF #1631042
  * Add man page linkcheckerrc(5) for the configuration file format.
  * Drop french translations, they are less than 20% complete for
    years now.
  * Correct misnamed colums in create.sql script: r/*string/\1/g
  * Improved cookie parsing:
    + Allow spaces in attribute values. Example:
      "Set-Cookie: expires=Wed, 12-Dec-2001 19:27:57 GMT"
      is now parsed correctly
    + Add an optional leading dot for domain names, and account for that
      in the domain checking routine.
  * Don't print cached errors or warnings unless verbose output is
    requested.

Wed Oct 11 15:34:14 CEST 2006 - ro@suse.de

- update to 4.5
  - Don't ignore robots.txt entries consisting only of Allow: directives
  - Don't rely on HTTP HEAD requests to generate the same response status
    as HTTP GET. So we have to follow redirections when using HTTP GET to
    get page contents.
  - Document proxy URL syntax
  - Print active URLs on Ctrl-C interrupt
  - Replace all old "entry1, entry2" configuration entries with
    multiline "entry" config entry. The old syntax is still supported,
    but deprecated.
  - If LinkChecker was not able to spawn the initial checker and status
    threads, print an informative error instead of an internal error.
- update to 4.4
  - The JavaScript URL syntax check allows now digits and underscores
  - Add "internlinks" documentation and example to the default config
    file linkcheckerrc. 
  - Detect more cases when a HTTP connection cannot be reused and
    must be closed. And close response objects after usage
  - Only wait before a new connection to a host, not when reusing
    a previous connection.
  - Add more infos to various HTTP errors. Don't close connection when
    the response object is still open.
  - Ignore keyboard interrupts during shutdown
  - Removed old Psyco references from man page and documentation
- fix dependencies for old python2.4
