  - Fixed MacOS X support - Reimplemented semaphores using named ones
    for Apple builds
  - Fixed resource leak on failure in openSocket()
  - Improved configuration file modification check to include file
    size, in addition to file modification time
  - Fixed non-STLPort4 builds with Solaris Studio. Switch
    '-library=stlport4' is only added if CXXFLAGS does not already
    contain a switch matching -library=(stlport4|stdcxx4|Cstd)
  - Fixed --disable-shared MinGW builds
  - Fixed non-working MinGW DLL binaries. DllMain() was not being
    called because of missing extern "C" in its definition
  - CMake build configuration checks have been improved
  - GCC switch -O2 is only added if CXXFLAGS does not already contain
    any other -O
  - Improved logging speed using SysLogAppender and Log4jUdpAppender
    by optimizations in both the loggers and in common sockets code
  - FileAppender locale can now be specified in properties files using
    Locale property. See FileAppender Doxygen documentation for more
    details
  - Improved Log4jUdpAppender compatibility with Chainsaw
  - Fixed crash, bugs #3467112 and #3563699, related to thread-local
    storage destruction
  - Fixed build with Visual Studio 2005, bug #3565529
  - Created Cygwin port's .cygport definition for log4cplus
  - Improved hiding of private symbols using GCC's
    __attribute__((visibility("hidden"))) and Solaris Studio's
    __hidden
  - Fixed build in environments where DEBUG (and other log level
    names) are macros.
  - Improved configuration of threads support
  - Turned on __thread (TLS) detection on NetBSD 5.1.0 and later that
    has been previously disabled
  - Improved compatibility with log4cplus 1.0.x: allow using log4cplus
    1.0.x log level to string callbacks in 1.1.x
  - Improved various M4 macros
  - Added detection and use C++11 thread_local
  - Fixed XML entities escaping in Log4jUdpAppender
  - Re-added synchronization between ConsoleAppender and LogLog
  - Changed C logger API to return int instead of bool
  - Added C logger API to Visual Studio 2010 projects
  - Implemented remote syslog logging using UDP in SysLogAppender
  - Enabled SysLogAppender on Windows with only remote syslog logging
    enabled
  - IMPORTANT: Builds with --with-iconv configure switch now assume
    UTF-8 for plain char strings
  - Bumped up SO version for UDP sockets support related changes
  - Removed Windows CE support

    log4j XML payload to Chainsaw or Log2Console
  - Added support for __func__ as function name source for logging
    events
  - Fixed compilation for build with wchar_t being alias to unsigned
    short (/Zc:wchar_t-) (Windows)

    PropertyConfigurator
  - Added #pragma once to all headers

    process start by default
  - Fixed single threaded log4cplus build issues
  - Added ability to log to std::cerr
  - Fixed disabling of LOG4CPLUS_*_FMT() macros

    layout
  - Added function name converter (%M)
