- update to 1.22:
  * Lzip now reports an error if a file name is empty (lzip -t "").
  * Option '-o, --output' now behaves like '-c, --stdout', but
    sending the output unconditionally to a file instead of to
    standard output.

    is a terminal.
  * Lzip can now be built, tested, and installed on systems
    lacking a 'make' program. (Feature suggested by Mohammad
    Akhlaghi).
  * The words 'decompressed' and 'compressed' have been replaced
    with the shorter 'out' and 'in' in the verbose output when
    decompressing or testing.
  * Option '--list' now reports corruption or truncation of the
    last header in a multimenber file specifically instead of
    showing the generic message "Last member in input file is
    truncated or corrupt."
  * The commands needed to extract files from a tar.lz archive
    have been documented in the manual, in the output of '--help',
    and in the man page.
  * Plzip and tarlz are mentioned in the manual as alternatives for
    multiprocessors.
  * Several fixes and improvements have been made to the manual.
