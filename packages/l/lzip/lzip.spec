%description
Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe
integrity checking and a user interface almost identical to the one of
bzip2. Lzip is only a data compressor, not an archiver. It has no facilities
for multiple files, encryption, or archive-splitting, but, in the Unix
tradition, relies instead on separate external utilities such as GNU Tar for
these tasks.
