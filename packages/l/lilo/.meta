  <title>The Linux Loader, a Boot Menu</title>
  <description>LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other operating
systems, such as MS-DOS and OS/2, and can even boot DOS from the second
hard drive. The configuration file is /etc/lilo.conf.

The PowerPC variant can be used on new PowerMacs and CHRP machines.

The ix86 variant comes with Memtest86, offering an image that can be
booted to perform a memory test.</description>
