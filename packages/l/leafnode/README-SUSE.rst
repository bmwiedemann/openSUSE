This is package of the latest snapshot of the upstream git
repository on https://gitlab.com/leafnode-2/leafnode-2 . It seems 
strange to use git checkout for the stable server package, but 
the development has stalled (as of today 2019-11-18, the last 
commit is a year old and it is mine), but the upstream maintainer 
for whatever reasons doesnâ€™t want to make official release.

There are no scripts or any method of converting the currently 
existed leafnode-1 instance to leafnode-2. This is `what I got`_ 
from the upstream maintainer:

    Leafnode-2 has some minor update aids in place, one of the 
    most important parts is running "texpire -r" to rebuild the 
    hashes, and "fetchnews -f" to re-fetch the active files. See 
    README.html for other migration information regarding 
    configuration settings.

For better orientation the package changelog has interspersed 
records from leafnode-2 package in the originally leafnode-1 one. 
They are all from me (mcepl@something) and they are marked as 
``[leafnode-2]`` in the first line of the record.

There is a droplet for sudoers allowing an user in the group
``newsadmin`` to run without a password command::

    sudo -u news /usr/sbin/fetchnews -vvv -e
