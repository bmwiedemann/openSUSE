# Leafnode filter configuration file (see the applyfilter(8) manual page
# and /usr/share/doc/packages/leafnode/filters.example)
# 
# this file contains the set of filtering rules that are applied
# to the newsspool. Each rule must be on a separate line. Empty lines
# and comments (marked by a #  at the beginning of the line) are allowed.
#
# Each rule is a regular expression. For example, the following set of
# rules will delete all crosspostings to alt.flame.

# ^Newsgroups:.*[, ]alt.flame$
# ^Newsgroups:.*[, ]alt.flame,
