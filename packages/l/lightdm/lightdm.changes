- Change paths from /etc to /usr/etc for UsrEtc Move (boo#1177197)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 29 09:35:19 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Fixup pam stack a bit more (boo#1176338):
  + Do not create hardlinks between lightdm pam files and xdm's pam
    files, but install explicit lightdm pam stack that @includes
    xdm. This has the advantage that, if an admin creates
    /etc/pam.d/xdm, we will follow this right away. With the
    hardlinks, the /usr/etc/pam.d/xdm would still be used, which
    might not be the expected outcome.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 17 12:12:31 UTC 2020 - Dominique Leuenberger <dimstar@opensuse.org>

- Follow XDM's change of moving the default pam config file to
  /usr/etc (boo#1176338).
- Add pre/posttrans scripts to ensure user modified
  /etc/pam.d/lightdm* survives our move to /usr/etc (and user
  modification in /etc/pam.d wins over /usr/etc/pam.d).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct  1 11:34:16 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 1.19.5:
  * Fix errors in documentation generation.
  * Improve documentation.
  * Fix guest AppArmor profile to allow guest sessions more access
    to the upstart session socket.
  * Fix a small memory leak in liblightdm-gobject keyboard layout
    code.
- Rerebase lightdm-sysconfig-support.patch (boo#1002061).
- Better X11-displaymanagers-lightdm.
- Remove lightdm-rpmlintrc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 25 10:00:10 UTC 2016 - sor.alexei@meowr.ru

- Update to version 1.19.4 (changes since 1.19.0):
  * Rename "xlocal" seat type to "local". Using "xlocal" will
    continue to work but will report a warning.
  * Fix memory leaks.
  * Fix uninitialised memory errors.
  * Use MIR_SERVER_HOST_SOCKET instead of MIR_SOCKET to report
    compositor socket to sessions. This used to work but no longer
    works in Mir 0.21
  * Allow XMir to run on the xlocal seat using the new
    x-server-backend=mir option.
  * Use only a single compositor on local seats.
  * Fix Mir greeter log filename having "(null)" in the name.
  * Copy fcitx/mozc rules so session works when these aren't
    installed.
  * Revert lxsession change - it caused the AppArmor to fail to
    compile.
  * Add support for greeters running inside sessions. This is
    enabled by setting X-LightDM-Allow-Greeter inside the session
    .desktop file.
    The session can then use liblightdm to connect one greeter to
    the daemon. The communication is done using a socket
    (/var/run/lightdm/<user>/greeter-socket) that is accessible to
    any process ran by that user. Consider controlling access to
    this socket using a MAC system such as AppArmor.
  * Report errors for all liblightdm methods. This will require
    existing greeters to update their API usage. The ABI is
    unchanged.
  * Handle EAGAIN correctly when daemons communicate with the
    daemon.
  * Drop support for mir-container sessions - no-one ever used these.
  * Fix in-session greeters not working for greeter logins.
  * Fix various issues in new in-session greeter code.
  * Fix user list memory management exposed by use of in-session
    greeters.
  * Fix some spurious warnings in the log.
- Rebase lightdm-sysconfig-support.patch,
  lightdm-xauthlocalhostname-support.patch.
- Use tarball signing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

   lightdm-sysconfig-support.patch
   lightdm-use-run-dir.patch
   lightdm-xauthlocalhostname-support.patch
* Don't enable the hardware cursor in Unity System Compositor anymore.
      Unity 8 now correctly provides its own cursor and other shells should too
* Handle XDMCP Request packet with no addresses.
* Don't start LightDM if the XDMCP server is configured with a key that
      doesn't exist.
* Add IP addresses to XDMCP log messages.

* Add a backup-logs option that can be used to disable existing logging
      files having a .old suffix added to them.
* Add LC_PAPER, LC_NAME, LC_ADDRESS, LC_TELEPHONE, LC_MEASUREMENT and
      LC_IDENTIFICATION variables to the list of inherited locale variables.
* Implement XDMCP ForwardQuery.

* Disable log backups - this interferes with logrotate.
* Support using libaudit to generate audit events.
* Handle trailing whitespace on boolean values in configuration.
* Update example configuration to more correctly match allowed options.
* Fix unnecessary X server from being launched when locking seats.

* Don't remove autotools generated files in distclean. 
* Fix default X server command set to XMir in 1.15.0.
* Internally merge the [SeatDefaults] and [Seat:*] sections together. The
      previous method meant configuration snippets using a mix of old and new
      naming would not correctly override eachother.
* Use IP address of XDMCP requests to contact X server if available.
* Add an option for XDMCP and VNC servers to only listen on one address.
* Fix configuration file warnings so they go to the log, not stderr.

Wed Sep 23 09:44:58 UTC 2015 - sndirsch@suse.com

- displaymanager default setting in %post/postun:
  * don't limit it to openSUSE >= 13.1 (has been done accidently)
  * make sure not to replace DISPLAYMANAGER in comments
  * only reset DISPLAYMANAGER to "" when uninstalling lightdm,
    not also in the update case (OMG!)
  * ldconfig is not required at all for the main package

    * Deprecate [SeatDefaults] in favour of [Seat:*]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  9 20:38:31 UTC 2015 - peter@itwm.fhg.de

- fix XDMCP setting in lightdm-sysconfig-support.patch: Setting
  DISPLAYMANAGER_XSERVER_TCP_PORT_6000_OPEN=true forced LightDM to
  open port 6000 for XDMCP protocol (instead of its default port
  177). As a consequence, usual X11 terminals weren't able to
  contact the XDM service. However, this sysconfig setting should
  only request the XServer to open port 6000 for requests to a
  running X11 session and leave the XDMCP port unchanged.

- Drop option logind-load-seats=true from 50-suse-defaults.conf.

  - Don't access .dmrc files until information from these files is
    required.

    user able to be logged in with
