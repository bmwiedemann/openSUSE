- update to 2.2.3
  - enhaencement: supporting includes with new filter and filterFrom 
    options
  - change: needing now at least Lua 5.2 (Lua 5.1 no longer 
    supported, Lua5.3 supported)
  - change: if the target/targetdir ends with a ':' do not append 
    a trailing '/' to it, since that would change it from homedir 
    to rootdir!
  - add: example for Amazon S3 Bucket (Daniel Miranda)
  - fix: setting stdout/stderr to linebuffer mode.
  - fix: Lua5.3 compatiblity, using load() instead of loadstring()
  - fix: cmake lua detection, will resort to "lua" and "luac" 
    binaries only if more specific suffixes (e.g. luac5.3) are not
    available
  - fix: test suit, Lua5.3 compatibility (table.unpack)
- changes from 2.2.2
  - fix: checkgauge 'insist'
  - fix: no partial path exlusion tests
  - fix: write pid of forked process in pidfile
  - fix: crash on not reachable target
  - workaround: changed back to filter style rsync calling until 
    https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12569 is fixed and 
    released.
- changes from 2.2.1
  - enhancement: now always using filter lists with rysnc instead 
    of include/exclude lists taking advantage of the new 
    --delete-missing-args parameter to delete files on target. 
    >>> Thus Lsyncd 2.2.1 needs rsync >= 3.1.0
  - change: added "tests" make target to run all the tests.
  - fix: crash due to typo in changed ^path, ^pathdir, ^pathname
- changes from 2.2.0
  - enhancement: add rsync options:
                "append",
                "append_verify",
                "backup",
                "backup_dir",
                "chmod",
                "chown",
                "copy_dirlinks",
                "existing",
                "groupmap",
                "omit_dir_times",
                "omit_link_times",
                "suffix,"
                "usermap",
  - enhancement: settings{ } now checks for unknown entries and 
    errors if so.
  - change: Level3 scripts ^path,^pathdir and ^pathname now don't 
    start with a slash.
  - change: Lsyncd now writes a startup log message before 
    daemonizing does in case logging fails, it is recognized before
    it cannot message anything about it, since it deamonized
  - change: compatible with Lua5.3 (along with 5.1 and 5.2)
  - change: _verbatim forced for 'exitcodes' entry.
  - change: manpage is not rebuild by default. it is provided 
    precompiled.
  - change: faulty/deprecated config files that use 
    settings = { ... }, with equal sign are no longer worked 
    around.
  - change: default.direct now calls copy with -p
  - fix: potential race conditions: default.rsyncssh will now 
    channel deletes also through rsync and treats moves as 
    blocking events.
  - fix: ']' is not escaped for rsync rules, since rsync only 
    applies doesn't applie pattern matching if no other pattern 
    chars are found.
  - fix: Shell injection hole close for default.direct on mv 
    commands.
  - fix: Crash of default-direct when source doesn't exit
  - fix: fixed faulty event replacement, a race condition noticed 
    by extensive default.rsyncssh testing changed Delays were not

    inclusions

  - fix: fixed Finished/Retrying error messages being swapped around
  - fix: properly encapsulate filenames on ssh mv commands to avoid 
    shell command injections.
  - fix: postcmd example
  - change: closes also on INT signals
  - change: now removes its pidfile on INT and TERM signals
  - change: changed build system from autotools to cmake
