For iso images processed with isohybrid such as openSUSE installation DVD and
UEFI boot support and any other Linux distributions select "isohybrid" from
distribution selection dialog. This will erase all the data from the USB stick.

Standard openSUSE DVD or NET installation iso can also be written with --suse
option when used with live-grub-stick, openSUSE DVD on non-vfat partition and
NET installation on vfat parition.

Please note that USB created using isohybrid mode will be wiped out completely and
will not be usable from Windows OS, so back up the data from the USB stick before hand.

It is possible to boot multiple distributions and iso images from same device,
should work with all recent distributions' live iso images.
Fedora iso is not copied when live-fat-stick is used but is extracted,
when live-grub-stick is used all isos are copied.
