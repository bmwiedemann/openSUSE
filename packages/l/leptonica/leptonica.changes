-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Sep 27 20:56:59 UTC 2015 - asterios.dramis@gmail.com

- Update to 1.72:
  * Better handling of 1 bpp colormap read/write with png so that
    they are losseless. The colormap is always removed on read and
    the conversion is to the simplest non-cmapped pix that can
    fully represent the input -- both with and without alpha.
  * Fixed overflow bug in pixCorrelationBinary().
  * Fixed orientation flags and handling of 16 bit RGB in tiff.
  * Also new wrappers to TIFFClientOpen(), so we no longer go
    through the file descriptor for memory operations.
  * Improvements in the dewarp functions.
  * New box sequence smoothings.
  * New antialiased painting through mask; previously it was only
    implemented for connected components in a mask.
  * Better error handling and debug output with jpeg2000
    read/write.
  * Implemented base64 encoding. This allows binary data to be
    represented as a C string that can be compiled. Used this in
    bmf utility.
  * Implemented automatic code generation for deserialization from
    compiled strings (stringcode.*)
  * Regression tests write to leptonica subdir of in windows; in
    unix it is optional.  This avoids spamming the directory.
  * Added new colorspace conversions (XYZ, LAB).
  * New source files: encoding.c, bmfdata.h, stringcode.c,
    stringcode.h, bootnumgen.c.
  * Removed source files: convolvelow.c, graymorphlow.c
  * New programs: genfonts_reg, colorize_reg, texturefill_reg,
    autogentest1, autogentest2.
  * alltests_reg now has 66 tests.
- Added new build requirement openjpeg2-devel for openSUSE > 13.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 27 06:01:17 UTC 2014 - lazy.kent@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.71.
  * This version supports tesseract 3.0.4. In particular, 3.0.4 has
    automatic conversion of a set of scanned images, either in a
    directory or coming directly from a scanner, into pdf with
    injected text. This is something we've wanted to do for several
    years!
  * Improved jp2k header reading, including resolution.
  * Removed src files: rotateorthlow.c, pdfio.c, pdfiostub.c.
  * Renamed jp2kio.c, jp2kiostub.c ==> jp2kheader.c,
    jp2kheaderstub.c. These header reading functions parse the jp2k
    files, and don't require a jpeg2000 library.
  * New jp2kio.c, jp2kiostub.c, that uses openjpeg-2.X to read and
    write jp2k. We now support I/O from these formats: png, tiff,
    jpeg, bmp, pnm, webp, gif and jp2k as well as writing to
    PostScript and pdf.
  * New pdfio1.c, pdfio1stub.c, pdfio2.c pdfio2stub.c, where we've
    split functions into high and low level.
  * Fixed memory bug in bilateral.c.
  * Improved reading/write of binary data from file. For example,
    l_binaryReadStream() can now be used to capture data piped in
    via stdin.
  * Font directory now arg passed in everywhere (not hardcoded).
  * Don't write temporary files to /tmp; only to a small number of
    subdirectories, to avoid spamming the /tmp directory. E.g., for
    regression tests, the current output is now to /tmp/regout/.
  * For jpeg reading modify pixReadJpeg() to take as a hint a bit
    flag that allows extraction of only the luminance channel.
  * Allow wrapping of pdf objects from png images without
    transcoding.
  * Better support for alpha on read/write with png, including 1
    bpp with colormap, alpha (supported in png with transparency
    array).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jan 26 07:46:30 UTC 2014 - lazy.kent@opensuse.org

- Update to 1.70.
  * New bilateral filtering.
  * New simple character recognition utility.
  * Improved dewarping functionality, in model building and
    rendering. More flexible use of ref models.
  * Better and more consistent handling of alpha layer in RGBA,
    though use of the spp field.  Ability to handle more png files
    with alpha, including palette with alpha.
  * New fast converters from jpeg and jpeg2000 to pdf, without
    transcoding.
  * Made bmp reader (and pix reading in general) more robust; avoid
    size overflow errors.
  * New text labelling operations; depth conversion of a set of
    images.

  * Fixed bug in PDF generation for large files, using a new double
    array (dnabasic.c).  Added several new modes for PDF generation
    from sets of images.
  * Dewarp based on image content now aligns to left and right
    margins; works at book level; is more robust to bad disparity
    models; version 2 serialization.
  * Improved sorting efficiency of numas in cases where binning,
    which is order N, makes sense.
  * Fixed fpix serialization (now version 2).
  * New version (5) of xtractprotos, allows putting prototypes
    in-line in allheaders.h.  Having them separately in
    leptprotos.h still an option.
  * New src files: boxfunc4.c coloring.c, dnabasic.c.
