- Update to version 6.2.3:
  * Add a couple of extra trim() calls to path strings given to
    the Fortran API.
  * Apply lhapdf script improvement from Ivan Razumov / Genser.
- Changes from version 6.2.2:
  * Don't pop the final path entry off in the pathsPrepend and
    pathsAppend functions: the compile-time fallback may have been
    disabled.
  * Add a 'show' option to the lhapdf script.
  * Adapt MPI file-reading patch from Stefan Hoeche. Enable with
    --enable-mpi to configure.
  * Rewrite the lhapdf data-manager script to use argparse, for
    compatibility with Python 3.
  * Apply compiler optimisation bypass "volatile" hack to default
    data path insertion. Thanks to Zahari Kassabov.
  * Add legend PDF name aliasing to plotpdfs
  * Explicitly catch x > xMax error in ContinuationExtrapolator.
  * Don't require the presence of Content-Length in HTTP header.
  * Utils.h: Fix separator bug in join() function.
  * Remove 'const's from return-by-value types in KnotArray.h, to
    keep icpc happy.
  * Add lhapdf_lambda4/5 functions in the Fortran interface.
  * Remove unwanted pid argument from the Fortran xfx*_stdpartons
    functions.
  * Move Config::get() static function from header to .cc, since a
    singleton needs to only 'live' in one compilation unit.

Mon Feb  1 13:01:58 UTC 2016 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.1.6:
  + Add canonical PDF.orderQCD property to Python PDF, to replace
    PDF.qcdOrder.
  + Add PDF::quarkMass and PDF::quarkThreshold methods to C++ and
    Python.
  + Fix quark integer ID mapping to Down/Up metadata keys in
    AlphaS factory routine.
  + Add a cstr_to_fstr function to LHAGlue.cc, for improved C++ to
    Fortran string conversion (handling length limits, padding
    rather than zero-termination, etc.)
  + Add PDF::print() protection against being unable to read the
    PDF set index file, so there isn't a crash for the trivial
    reason of on-screen printout formatting when the data path is
    restricted with trailing ::.
  + Fixes to the lhapdf script. Thanks again to Dmitry Kalinkin
    for a patch.
  + Add missing getlam4 and getlam5 functions to Fortran
    interface. Thanks to Dmitry Kalinkin for the patch.
  + Update Cython and Python interfaces to support Python3 syntax.
    Thanks to Vitaly Yermolchyk for the patches!
  + Update to even newer boost.m4
  + Don't append the install prefix to path searches if
    $LHAPDF_DATA_PATH ends with a double-colon, ::.
  + De-inline the availablePDFSets() function, and veto duplicate
    set names.
  + Determine number of parameter variation members by counting
    number of "+" signs in ErrorType, e.g. "replicas+as+mc+mb+mt".
  + Added a new checkPdfType() member function to PDFSet class.
  + Added support for combined PDF+alphaS sets via new ErrorType
    values, i.e. "replicas+as", "hessian+as" and "symmhessian+as".
  + Updating AUTHORS notice to final EPJC paper reference, and
    adding a final citation reminder message via the Config
    destructor.
  + src/Factories.cc: Adding a set of expandPDFsStr(),
    decodePDFStr and decodePDFsStr functions to be used for
    handling more general PDF strings of the sort that will be
    used in the CompositePDF factory system.
  + Adding a default constructor and knotarrays() accessor to
    GridPDF, as requested by Nathan Hartland.
  + Remove abs(...) twice in function
    PDFSet::randomValueFromHessian to correct a mistake in Eq.
    (6.5) of arXiv:1205.4024v2.  The correction is necessary to
    ensure that correlations are preserved when converting a
    Hessian PDF set to a Monte Carlo PDF set.
- Drop LHAPDF-boost-configure-for-GCC5.patch, incorporated
  upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 25 04:56:40 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Add LHAPDF-boost-configure-for-GCC5.patch to fix autoconf
  boost macros lookup with GCC5; patch taken from boost.m4
  upstream [https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4].

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 20 19:10:37 UTC 2015 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.1.5:
  + Better error handling in PDF index lookup, including clearer
    reporting of set-unmatched PDF IDs and member numbers which
    are out of range for a valid set.
  + Restoring original active set member in LHAGlue metadata get*
    functions which were previously switching focus as a result of
    calling loadMember() to get numerical grid data.
  + Making LHAGlue Fortran interface switch the current set slot
    more coherently (has_photon is the exception).
  + Attempt to use Threshold* metadata keys for Fortran
    getthresholdm_ and old C++ wrapper getThreshold. Not yet fully
    supported in the rest of the system but we may as well
    pre-empt it while editing LHAGlue.cc.
  + Add missing getdescm_ and getdesc_ Fortran functions.
  + Add missing Fortran getdatapath function, cf. LHAPDF5 but with
    colon separators between multiple paths if appropriate.
  + Add Fortran lhapdf_getpdfsetlist function, returning the list
    of available PDF sets as a space-separated string. Note the
    lhapdf_ prefix -- this is the intended 'namespace' form for a
    new Fortran interface at some point.
  + Remove obsolete config flags from lhapdf.conf
  + examples/compatibility.cc: Simplify compatibility macro
    checking.
  + Add parsing and use of the internal PID data line in
    GridPDF.cc, in preference to the PDF::flavors() method. This
    fixes a bug, since flavors() was sorting the list, meaning
    that data files without monotonically sorted PID columns would
    wrongly assign PDFs to PIDs.
  + Added new ContinuationExtrapolator to provide same
    extrapolation as in the MSTW standalone code (and LHAPDF5 when
    using MSTW sets).
  + Better code organisation and protection against out-of-bounds
    array accesses in log-bicubic interpolator.
  + Fallback to bilinear interpolator if using bicubic
    interpolator with only 2 or 3 Q2 knots in a subgrid.
  + Improve LHAGlue info messages to not specify that particular
    generators are being used.
- LHAPDF-devel should require boost-devel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep  6 22:23:20 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.1.4:
  - Adding multiset variants of the 5 getmin/max LHAGlue
    functions
  - Adding the 'unofficial' getminmax Fortran function to
    LHAGlue.cc
  - Treat PID 0 as an alias for 21 in PDF::hasFlavor as well as
    the PDF::xf* functions

    available sets, not those installed on the user's system
  - Update CONFIGFLAGS docs to fix some errors w.r.t. actual flag
    usage
  - Treat a DataVersion of 0 as unvalidated: valid numbers now
    start at 1
  - Remove the LHAPDF ID from the warning printout about
    unvalidated PDFs, since in that case there will usually be no
    standard ID number and it just gets unhelpfully reported as -1
  - Detect and report improperly terminated grid files (ones
    missing a --- final line)
  - Replace asserts with exceptions and improve subgrid error
    reporting in GridPDF
  - Report the value of Q2 that causes a subgrid-finding failure
  - Improve testgrid to use PDFNAME/MEMNUM arg syntax
  - Forbid compilation if the demon combination of Boost < 1.47
    and	GCC >= 4.6, with a serious bug in BOOST_FOREACH, is found:

  - Improved AlphaS ODE solver performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 21 21:51:34 UTC 2014 - badshah400@gmail.com

- Update to version 6.1.3:
  + tests/Makefile.am: Add appropriate programs to "make
    installcheck"
  + wrappers/python/Makefile.am: 'make distcheck' and
    out-of-source builds should work now
  + Add CVMFS and AFS downloading (by preference) to the lhapdf
    script, as well as user-configurable download sources and
    tarball removal
  + Fix bug in PDF::qcdOrder method, and deprecate that method in
    favour of orderQCD (to match AlphaS and the flag name).
  + Further improvements to error messages when trying to load an
    invalid PDF
  + Tweak output of testalphas.cc
  + Adding first make check targets (requires CT10nlo to be
    installed)
  + Flavour thresholds in alpha_s solvers, and threshold subgrids
    from ODE solver (by Karl Nordstrom)
  + Add accessors to a PDF's AlphaS object and to an AlphaS' QCD
    order
  + Add mapping of reweighting functions into Python
  + Fix compiler warnings re. unused variables in LHAGlue.h and
    AlphaS.h headers

  + Lots of changes since previously packaged version, see
    /usr/share/doc/packages/ChangeLog for a full list
  + Now installs a pkgconfig file (introduces BuildRequires on
    pkg-config)
  + Requires boost >= 1.53.0 (not available on <= 12.3).
