  <title>An English grammar checker</title>
  <description>The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on link
grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a sentence, the
system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of a set of
labeled links connecting pairs of words. The parser also produces a
&quot;constituent&quot; (Penn tree-bank style phrase tree) representation of a
sentence (showing noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.).</description>
