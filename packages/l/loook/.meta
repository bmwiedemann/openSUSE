  <title>Search strings in ODF documents</title>
  <description>This program is a program written in Python that searches for strings
in files created by OpenOffice.org, Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice or
StarOffice 6.0 or higher. This is especially true for all documents
that were created in the Open Document Format. In addition, it can now
also search in documents created by Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint
from the 2007 version in an OOXML format.</description>
