-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 23 10:54:15 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

- Update to version 47.2:
  + Don't call style manager in application constructor since this

Thu Oct 17 07:31:05 UTC 2024 - Bjørn Lie <bjorn.lie@gmail.com>

    the thumbnail download is using a lot of VRAM.
