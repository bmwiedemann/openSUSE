    * The admin.list now supports multiple targets for the same message (issue #326)
    * Use full path_regularize() on all TCL program files.  Having paths like /a/b/../d
      caused problems for some users when interacting with TCL.

    * luaposix 34.0.4-1 wants to use setfenv() which only exists in Lua 5.1 and not in Lua 5.2+
      so Lmod now requires("posix") outside of strict.
    * Build lua-term in the correct location when --with-siteControlPrefix=yes
    * issue #347: Remove ./?.lua, ./?/init.lua from LUA_PATH and ./?.so from LUA_CPATH

            The command "make world_update" now marks the latest release as the latest release at
	    github.com/TACC/Lmod
    * The new module command now returns the status from the eval of the lmod command
    * Block .version.version and .modulerc.version files from being included in DirTree
    * Bash like shells now output without double quotes.
    * Fix fish shell output for path and infopath. Fix shell function output for zsh/bash

      inside a modulefile and have it work when unloading.
    * issue #375: Support for is-loaded and is-avail added.
    * Do not convert LMOD_PKG from /opt/apps/lmod/7.7.35 to /opt/apps/lmod/lmod if the link exists.
    * When building reverseMap also take abspath(path) and store it if different.
    * Now make startup scripts (profile.in, cshrc.in, profile.fish.in) use PKGV instead of PKG so
      that the pre-install create $VERSION files. The install target will convert them to PKG.
    * Check for "g" tools like gbasename, gexpr as well as the regular basename, expr etc.

        NVV module layouts were mixed.

        scripts.
     4. Allow colons as well as spaces for the path used in the addto command.
     5. Handles module directories that are empty or bad symlink or a .version
        file only.
     6. Fix bug in module describe.
   * Lmod 7.1:
     1. The commands "module --show_hidden avail" and "module --show_hidden"
        list now show "hidden" modules with the (H) property.  Also they are
        displayed as dim.  This works better on black backgrounds.
     2. Added the command "module --config_json" to generate a json output of
        Lmod's configuration.
     3. Add support for env. var. LMOD_SITE_NAME to set a site's name.  This is
        also a configure option.

     5. Installed Modules can be hidden by "hide-version foo/3.2.1" in any
        modulerc file.
     6. The system spider cache has changed.  Please update your scripts to

        time to run all TCL progams.
     2. Now uses a custom _module_dir function for tab completion in bash for
        module use path<TAB>. Thanks to Pieter Neerincx!
     3. Support for LMOD_FAMILY_<name>_VERSION added.
     4. If ~/.lmod.d/.cache/invalidated exists then the user cache file(s) are
        ignored. When generating a user cache file ~/.lmod.d/.cache/invalidated
        is deleted.
     Bug Fixes:
     1. Correctly merges spider cache location where there are multiple
        lmodrc.lua files.
     2. Remove leading and trailing blanks for names in setenv, pushenv,
        prepend_path, etc.

        minus. (e.g. ml --vers)
     4. pushenv("name","") fixed when unloading module.
     5. Make sure to regularize MODULEPATH when ingesting it for the first 
     	time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 12 04:28:38 UTC 2016 - eich@suse.com

* Updated to version 6.5.11:
 - All the Lmod programs now resolve any symlinks to the
   actual program before adding to the Lua's package.path
   and package.cpath.
 - Contrib patch: Extend msgHook to LmodError and LmodWarning
 - Now using travis for CI and testing.
 - Configure time option to have Lmod check for magic TCL string in
   modulefiles (#%Module)
 - Lmod now uses a regular expression to match user commands
   to internal commands. For example "av", "ava" or "available"
   will match "avail"
 - Lmod now uses the values of LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH at
   configuration time.  This way Lmod is safe from user changes
   to these important Lua values.
 - Updated documentation at lmod.readthedocs.org
 - Support for generating xalt_rmapT.json used by XALT.
 - Fixed bug with upcase characters in version file.   
 - It is now possible to configure Lmod to use the spider cache
   when loading (--with-cachedLoads=yes or
   export LMOD_CACHED_LOADS=1 to activate). This is off by
   default. Sites that use this will have to keep their spider
   caches up-to-date or user will not be able to load modules 
   not in the cache.
- It is now possible to configure Lmod to use Legacy Version
  ordering ( --with-legacyOrdering=yes or export
  LMOD_LEGACY_VERSION_ORDERING=1). With legacy ordering 9.0
  is "newer" than 10.0. This is the ordering that Tmod uses.
- Lmod will print admin message (a.k.a nag messages) when   
  doing module whatis <foo> or module help <foo>.  In other 
  words if a nag message would appear with module load <foo>
  then it will also appear when using whatis or help.
- Many improvement in the generation of the lmod database for
  module tracking.
- Numerous bug fixes.
