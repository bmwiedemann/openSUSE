  <title>C++ library to assist value-oriented design</title>
  <description>lager is a C++ library to assist value-oriented design by implementing the
unidirectional data-flow architecture. It is heavily inspired by Elm and Redux,
and enables composable designs by promoting the use of simple value types and
testable application logic via pure functions.
