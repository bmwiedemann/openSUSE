%description
LZ4 is a lossless data compression algorithm that is focused on
compression and decompression speed. It belongs to the LZ77
(Lempel–Ziv) family of byte-oriented compression schemes. It is a
LZP2 fork and provides better compression ratio for text files.

This subpackage provides a GPL command-line utility to make use of
the LZ4 algorithm.
