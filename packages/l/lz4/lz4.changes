Tue Aug 16 07:20:23 UTC 2022 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 1.9.4
  * Decompression speed on high-end ARM64 platform is improved,
    by ~+20%.
  * For the specific scenario of data compressed with -BD4
    setting (small blocks, <= 64 KB, linked) decompressed
    block-by-block into a flush buffer (like lz4 CLI does),
    decompression speed is improved ~+70%.
  * For compressed data employing the lz4frame format (native
    format of lz4 CLI), it's possible to ignore checksum
    validation during decompression, resulting in speed
    improvements of ~+40% . This capability is exposed at both
    CLI (see --no-crc) and library levels.

Wed Feb  7 04:32:52 UTC 2018 - avindra@opensuse.org

- Update to new upstream release 1.8.1.2
  * Most visible new feature is support for dictionary compression
  * Support is now more formally added on the API side within
    lib/lz4frame_static.h. It's early days, and this new API is
    tagged "experimental" for the time being.
  * Support is also added in the command line utility lz4, using
    the new command -D. The behavior of this command is identical
    to zstd, should you be already familiar.
  * lz4 doesn't specify how to build a dictionary. All it says is
    that it can be any file up to 64 KB.
  * This approach is compatible with zstd dictionary builder, which
    can be instructed to create a 64 KB dictionary.
  * Improved performance at ultra settings (levels 10+).
  * These levels receive a new code, called optimal parser,
    available in lib/lz4_opt.h.
  * New parser uses less memory (from 384KB to 256KB), performs
    faster, compresses a little bit better (not much, as it was
    already close to theoretical limit), and resists pathological
    patterns which could destroy performance.
  * New parser is directly compatible with lower compression levels,
    which brings additional benefits:
    + Compatibility with LZ4_*_destSize() variant, which reverses
      the logic by trying to fit as much data as possible into a
      predefined limited size buffer.
    + Compatibility with Dictionary compression, as it uses the
      same tables as regular HC mode
  * In the future, this compatibility will also allow dynamic change
    of compression level.
  * Small set of bug fixes and improvements:
    + perf : faster and stronger ultra modes (levels 10+)
    + perf : slightly faster compression and decompression speed
    + perf : fix bad degenerative case
    + fix : decompression failed when using a combination of
      extDict + low memory address
    + cli : support for dictionary compression (-D)
    + cli : fix : lz4 -d --rm preserves timestamp
    + cli : fix : do not modify /dev/null permission as root
    + api : _destSize() variant supported for all compression
      levels
