%description
LatencyTOP is a Linux* tool for software developers (both kernel and
userspace), aimed at identifying where in the system latency is
happening, and what kind of operation/action is causing the latency to
happen so that the code can be changed to avoid the worst latency
hiccups. A version with graphic interface is available as xlatencytop.
