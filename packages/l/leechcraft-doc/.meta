  <title>LeechCraft is a free modular &quot;Internet client&quot; application.</title>
  <description> LeechCraft allows to browse the web, read RSS/Atom feeds, download
 files via BitTorrent, HTTP, FTP and DC, automatically stream,
 download or play podcasts and other media files and much more.

 Features can be easily added via plugins that can be integrated with
 each other with no effert while staying abstract from the exact
 implementation.
 .
 This package contains the main LeechCraft executable, which connects
 all the plugins with each other, routes requests between them, tracks
 dependencies and performs several other housekeeping tasks.
