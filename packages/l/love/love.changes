     via love.window.setFullscreen.

     pixel byte size multiplied by its width isn't a multiple of 4.
   * Fixed love.graphics.newVolumeImage when explicit mipmaps
     are provided.
   * Fixed freezes and crashes in automatic batching when an
     AMD GPU is used.
   * Fixed love.graphics.print and Image:replacePixels on more
     AMD/ATI GPUs.
   * Fixed Font:setFallbacks to account for different DPI scales
     in each fallback font.
   * Fixed Font:getWrap to not remove trailing newlines.
   * Fixed Text:getWidth when the Text's string only contains
     spaces.
   * Fixed a crash with some Intel graphics drivers on Linux.

     a volume or array Canvas is created.
   * Fixed DXT1 textures which use 1 bit alpha-cutout.
   * Fixed rare issues where textures were not sent to shaders
     correctly.
   * Fixed Shader:send(name, data, matrixlayout, ...).
   * Fixed quad offsets in ParticleSystems when
     ParticleSystem:setOffset is not used.
   * Fixed a performance issue with setting a small subrange of
     data in non-stream Meshes and SpriteBatches.
   * Fixed rounded rectangles breaking if the rx or ry parameters
     are negative.
   * Fixed rounded rectangle automatic points calculation when
     rx or ry are more than half the rectangle's size.
