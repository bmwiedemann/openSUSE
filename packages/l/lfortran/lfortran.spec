%global lfortran_desc \
LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran \
compiler built on top of LLVM. It can execute user's code interactively \
to allow exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as \
compile to binaries with the goal to run user's code on modern \
architectures such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
