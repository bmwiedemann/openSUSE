    <comment>- Update to 0.5.7.1:
  * Provide D3D12.DLL, based on vkd3d3-proton project
   (https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton),
   as part of our DXVK runtime. This will help push updates faster
   and provide better compatibility for Direct3D 12 titles such as
   World of Warcraft.</comment>

    <version>0.5.8</version>
    <time>1605644698</time>
    <user>dimstar_suse</user>
    <comment>- Update to 0.5.8:
  * 3rd party services are now available from the main window
  * The &quot;Import games&quot; window has been removed. The concept of
    importing games from other services into Lutris has been removed.
  * Syncing games from other services on start has been removed.
  * Integration with the lutris website such as login and showing your
    library has been delegated to the 'lutris' service in the sidebar.
  * The lutris service gives the option of searching your library or the whole
    lutris.net library.
  * Games from 3rd party services no longer depend on an install script to be
    present on the website. Lutris will automatically install games with an
    auto-generated script. Scripts from the website take precedence if available.
  * Steam games are directly loaded from the Steam API and it is no longer needed
    to sync your Steam library on the lutris website to see all your Steam games.
  * Game banners and icons are downloaded from the services themselves. This
    allows for customized media size in the UI based on what's available from the
    service.
  * Added option to hide the text under the icons
  * The installer game cache configuration has been moved to the installer
    window.
  * Installers now offer the choice between downloaded files, custom user
    provided files or cached files (when available).
  * Bonus content for GOG games such as manuals or soundtracks can now be
    downloaded as part of the install process. Selected content are downloaded
    in a 'extras' folder in the game folder. Those files will likely be in
    compressed format.
  * The right side bar has been moved to the bottom of the window to optimize
    space and to declutter the overall design. Game actions are now shown in a
    popover menu displayed next to the play button. Runner actions, if available
    (for example, wine), will show up in a popover menu next to the runner icon.</comment>
