Mon Nov 16 07:24:12 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.5.8:
  * 3rd party services are now available from the main window
  * The "Import games" window has been removed. The concept of
    importing games from other services into Lutris has been removed.
  * Syncing games from other services on start has been removed.
  * Integration with the lutris website such as login and showing your
    library has been delegated to the 'lutris' service in the sidebar.
  * The lutris service gives the option of searching your library or the whole
    lutris.net library.
  * Games from 3rd party services no longer depend on an install script to be
    present on the website. Lutris will automatically install games with an
    auto-generated script. Scripts from the website take precedence if available.
  * Steam games are directly loaded from the Steam API and it is no longer needed
    to sync your Steam library on the lutris website to see all your Steam games.
  * Game banners and icons are downloaded from the services themselves. This
    allows for customized media size in the UI based on what's available from the
    service.
  * Added option to hide the text under the icons
  * The installer game cache configuration has been moved to the installer
    window.
  * Installers now offer the choice between downloaded files, custom user
    provided files or cached files (when available).
  * Bonus content for GOG games such as manuals or soundtracks can now be
    downloaded as part of the install process. Selected content are downloaded
    in a 'extras' folder in the game folder. Those files will likely be in
    compressed format.
  * The right side bar has been moved to the bottom of the window to optimize
    space and to declutter the overall design. Game actions are now shown in a
    popover menu displayed next to the play button. Runner actions, if available
    (for example, wine), will show up in a popover menu next to the runner icon.
  * Running games have been moved from the right side bar to a row on the left
    side bar.
  * Added favorites section and allow to add/remove games from favorites
    When removing a game, Lutris now displays the size of the folder to be
    deleted.
  * Game logs are no longer erased when switching to another game in the
    window.
  * Game logs can be saved to a file
  * Lutris runners can now be written in JSON instead of Python code. This
    handles only simple cases but it's enough to handle a vast number of
    emulators or game engines. Some existing runners have been migrated to JSON
    such as dgen, ppsspp, citra, ags, virtualjaguar... as well as new ones like
    melonds, tic80, pcem... Check out the share/lutris/json folder for those
    runners. If you plan to submit new JSON based runner be sure to provide a valid
    'download_url' otherwise the lutris client won't have a runner to download.
  * Lutris will not delete any game folder that is used by another game or any
    folder that is in some predefined locations. Note that protection of folders
    such as 'Documents' or 'Downloads' only works on English locales for the moment.
  * Added a Mangohud option with special modes for OpenGL and 32bit games.
  * Added a wine menu entry to launch a bash shell in the game's environment
    with WINEPREFIX set and the correct Wine build aliased to wine.
  * Added a command line option to generate a bash script that will run a
    lutris game without the client. ex: lutris quake --output-script quake.sh.
    This will create a 'quake.sh' script to launch the game.
  * Removed all platform and runner icons from the code base to eliminate any
    issue regarding their licenses (This is done to help get the lutris
    package into debian).
  * DOSBox and PCSX2 display an error if needed libraries are missing.
  * The old versions of gamemode are no longer supported. Make sure you have
    the one that ships with a gamemoderun executable.
  * The runtime now supports downloading individual files. New icons can be
    submitted by sending a PR to github.com/lutris/lutris-runtime.
  * Refactor of several core components. New python packages
    lutris.database and lutris.gui.installer

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 20 07:56:54 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

  * Provide D3D12.DLL, based on vkd3d3-proton project
   (https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton),
   as part of our DXVK runtime. This will help push updates faster
   and provide better compatibility for Direct3D 12 titles such as
   World of Warcraft.
