  <title>A Real-Time Data Compression Library</title>
  <description>LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory. LZO is suitable for data compression
and decompression in real-time. This means it favors speed over
compression ratio.</description>
