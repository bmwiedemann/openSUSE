%description
Leancrypto provides a general-purpose cryptographic library with PQC-safe
algorithms. Further it only has POSIX dependencies, and allows all algorithms
to be used on stack as well as on heap. Accelerated algorithms are transparently
enabled if possible.

algorithms. Further it only has POSIX dependencies, and allows all algorithms
to be used on stack as well as on heap. Accelerated algorithms are transparently
enabled if possible.

This subpackage contains the FIPS 140 compliant version of the library.

%package -n %{name}-tools
Summary:        Applications provided by leancrypto

%description -n %{name}-tools
Leancrypto provides a general-purpose cryptographic library with PQC-safe
algorithms. Further it only has POSIX dependencies, and allows all algorithms
to be used on stack as well as on heap. Accelerated algorithms are transparently

%kernel_module_package

%package -n lib%{name}1-kernel
Summary:        Cryptographic library with PQC-safe algorithms Kernel Module Package

%description -n lib%{name}1-kernel
Leancrypto provides a general-purpose cryptographic library with PQC-safe
algorithms. Further it only has POSIX dependencies, and allows all algorithms
to be used on stack as well as on heap. Accelerated algorithms are transparently
enabled if possible.

This package contains the Linux kernel module version of leancrypto. This
kernel module offers the same APIs and functions in kernel space that are
available in user space.
