Thu Oct 23 13:22:46 UTC 2025 - Lucas Mulling <lucas.mulling@suse.com>

- Update to 1.6.0:
  * ASN.1: use stack for small generator for small use cases
  * X.509: Updates required to support the shim boot loader
  * X.509: add lc_gmtime to convert Epoch to time format
  * ASN.1: added to Linux kernel (for 64 bit systems only)
  * Added AES-GCM and AES-XTS
  * Availability: remove assert() calls throughout the code - in case of a self
    test error, disable the algorithm. Instead of using assert, apply a centrally
    managed test manager that stores the test status. This implies that some
    initalization APIs like lc_hash_init, lc_sym_init, lc_hmac_init are changed
    such that they return an error code if self tests failed. Thus, the version
    is now changed as this is considered to be an ABI change. Although this
    sounds heavy, the test manager is relatively small and the runtime state
    should be smaller than the old approach considering the old approach uses one
    global 32 bit integer per self test to maintain the state. This is now
    replaced with a set of 32 bit atomic integers that hold a 3-bit field for
    each algorithm. This change also adds the API call of lc_rerun_one_selftest
    which allows triggering the reruning of a self test for one given algorithm.
  * FIPS: Rearchitect integrity test control value generator: The build process now
    uses the host’s objcopy to extract the ELF sections of interest into a separate
    file, use a build_machine compiled version of sha3-256sum to generate the
    digest of it and reinsert it into the leancrypto-fips.so. This now allows
    cross-compilation with FIPS integrity test support. There is no functional
    change to leancrypto though.
  * Significant reduction of compilation units by almost half by not having
    global, but per-test compiled C files.
  * Linux kernel: add /proc/leancrypto
  * FIPS: Add negative testing support
  * Add SHAKE-512 and XDRBG-512 support
  * FIPS: Add FIPS indicator which implies that libleancrypto.so has the same
    functionality as libleancrypto-fips.so with the exception that the latter
    performs an integrity test.
  * ARMv9: fix BTI for ML-DSA
- Remove patch:
  * leancrypto-fix-aarch64-BTI.patch
- Don't strip debug symbols

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  part of ring1 following replacement of liboqs in gnutls [jsc#PED-3176]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 16 08:33:41 UTC 2025 - Pedro Monreal <pmonreal@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.1:
  * add ChaCha20 Poly 1305 AEAD
  * ChaCha20: add ARMv8 NEON, ARMv7 Neon, Intel AVX2, Intel AVX512,
    RISCV RVV/ZBB implementations
  * RISC-V entropy source: make implementation consistent to spec
  * Unify stack memory allocation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul  3 23:51:03 UTC 2025 - Lucas Mulling <lucas.mulling@suse.com>

- Update to 1.5.0:
  * Enable SHA3 CE 2x implementation for SLH-DSA and ML-DSA (performance increases 2 to 3 fold)
  * Fix lookup of RDRAND support in CPUID
  * Catch Y2038 issue on 32-bit systems that do not have 64 bit time_t support

  * Composite X.509 signatures: update implementation to match draft revision 5
  * Add support for the Linux kernel updated scatterwalk API in 6.15 for leancrypto_kernel_aead_ascon.ko
- Includes changes from 1.4.0:
  * ML-DSA: add signature generation rejection test cases and enable them during self tests
  * add HQC following reference implementation (https://pqc-hqc.org/implementation.html (versions from 2025-02-19)) but derived from PQClean implementation. NOTE: HQC is not yet considered stable as the implementation currently does not exhibit the IND-CCA2 property. Moreover, the FIPS standardization of HQC is pending. Changes to the HQC algorithm until standardization will need to be expected. I.e. the versioning rules of the library do not apply to the HQC algorithm until being announced in the CHANGES.md file.
  * ARMv8: properly save/restore SIMD registers v8 through v15 for ML-DSA/ML-KEM, X25519 and SHA3-CE (reported by Alexander Sosedkin)
  * Rust: add wrapper allowing a native interaction with the leancrypto library - the API offered by the Rust wrappers is not yet defined to be stable and may change to the next version - i.e. the versioning rules of the library do not apply to the Rust API until being announced in the CHANGES.md file.
  * Add “secure_execution” compile-time option
  * Add HQC AVX2 implementation derived from https://pqc-hqc.org/

- Changes 1.1.0

  * ML-KEM remove modulus check of decapsulation key (not required by FIPS 203)
  * ML-KEM: add key pair PCT API - leancrypto cannot invoke it itself as it does not know when both keys are provided from outside
  * ML-DSA: add consistency with FIPS 204 - the signature changes as the input data handling is added (if you want to apply the old signature, use the new lc_dilithium_[sign|verify]_ctx API with ctx->ml_dsa_internal = 1)
  * ML-DSA: add API to allow caller to provide a user context as allowed by FIPS 204, to invoke ML-DSA.Sign_internal, ML-DSA.Verify_internal and HashML-DSA

  * BIKE: Add NIST round 4 KEM candiate
  * ML-DSA: Add support to retain the expanded key to increase the performance of signature operations by 15 to 20%

  * ML-DSA, ML-KEM, SLH-DSA, BIKE, Hash, AEAD, RNG, HMAC, HKDF, symmetric: move API implementation from H to C file - this implies that no RUST wrappers are needed
  * Linux kernel: ML-DSA / SLH-DSA sigver input changed to be compliant to existing kernel structures: req->src SGL contains signature || msg, req->dst SGL is not processed

- Changes 1.0.1

  * fix: Kyber keygen - add LC_KYBER_K to initial hash (change is only relevant when storing keys as seed and for interoperability)
  * fix: Dilithium keygen - add dimensions K and L (change is only relevant when storing keys as seed and for interoperability)
  * small performance improvements for hasher apps

- Changes 1.0.0

  * enhancement: add Doxygen support - it is automatically compiled if Doxygen is present
  * enhancement: add Dilithium-ED25519 stream mode operation (i.e. init/update/final)
  * due to the Dilithium-ED25519 stream mode support, the Dilithium-ED25519 now used ED25519ph signature algorithm mode
  * Dilithium API change: the stream mode uses struct lc_dilithium_ctx instead of lc_hash_ctx to reflect the newly added Dilithium-ED25519 API - the lc_dilithium_ctx can be allocated on the stack or heap using LC_DILITHIUM_CTX_ON_STACK or lc_dilithium_ctx_alloc
  * enhancement: add Dilithium-ED25519 as Linux kernel akcipher algorithm
  * enhancement: make Kyber-X25519 as Linux kernel kpp algorithm consistent with the standalone Kyber kpp implementation and add a tester
  * seeded_rng: when using the ESDM as entropy source, use DRBG without prediction resistance. When having heavy respawning of applications, using the PR DRBG will strain the entropy source significantly.
  * Dilithium: add edge case tests as referenced by https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP/pull/1525.patch and https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/G8Zf0hC-uu0/m/Kb3qNJb0AwAJ

  * rename API lc_shake to lc_xof
  * enhancement: add Ascon Hash 128 and 128a

  * Dilithium 65: Add AVX2, ARMv8, ARMv7 support
  * Enable compilation of Kyber 1024, Kyber-768 and Kyber-512 at the same time (APIs starting with lc_kyber_768/lc_kex_768 refer to Kyber-768, APIs starting with lc_kyber_512/lc_kex_512 refer to Kyber-512, all others refer to Kyber-1024)
  * Enable compilation of Dilithium 87, Dilithium-65 and Dilithium-44 at the same time (APIs starting with lc_dilithium_65 refer to Dilithium-768, APIs starting with lc_dilithium_44 refer to Dilithium-44, all others refer to Dilithium-87)
  * enhancement: Windows is now supported as target platform using the MINGW compiler with full acceleration support
  * Dilithium: update SampleInBall implementation following https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/y8ul-ZcVWI4 - implementation is fully checked against NIST ACVP Demo server
