- Update Makefile.patch to current Makefile
- Update to version 2.0.0:
  * Human readable output format has changed.
  * Added watch mode, which will make lswt run continously,
    printing any updates to title and app-id of all toplevels as
    they happen.
  * Added support for the new ext-foreign-toplevel-info-v1
    protocol. lswt now supports both the ext- and the old wlr-
    protocol. Note that the feature set of these protocols is not
    congruent. The new ext- protocol offers unique identifiers for
    each toplevel, which should allow greater scripting abilities,
    while the older wlr- protocol supports states such as activated
    ("focused"), minimized, maximized and fullscreen. Should the
    Wayland server support both protocols, the newer ext- protocol
    is preferred.
  * The JSON output format has changed significantly. It gained a
    field indicating it's version and a field showing which
    toplevel states supported.
  * The TSV output format has been replaced by the more common and
    more widely supported CSV output format. Fields can be
    specified using a simple format string.
  * Fixed various bugs around printing NULL values and escaping
    strings for the machine readable output formats.
  * Fixed minor memory leak.
  * The Makefile has been updated to allow building on FreeBSD more
    easily.
  * lswt can now be build with clang more easiely.
