<package name="livedtd" project="openSUSE:Factory">
  <title>DTD Visualizing Tool</title>
  <description>The package comes with a Perl script (livedtd.pl) that converts an SGML
or XML DTD (Document Type Definition) into an HTML document.  The HTML
document is exactly the same text as the DTD but with &quot;live&quot; links that
let you navigate through the DTD.</description>
