- Update to 3.2.9 version
  + Decompression bug for PRDF 8 or 10 when the scanner channel
    and the NIR field are populated.
  + 3.2.8 **NOTE: The version number is 3.2.8 to be brought in line
    with the patch version number present in LAStools, which had
    been incremented without being kept in sync with the laszip.org
    version. We regret the error.
    bug fixes since 3.2.2:
    + 7 November 2018 upped to 3.2 r8 for identical legacy and
      extended flags check
    + 20 October 2018 upped to 3.2 r7 for rare bug in
      LASinterval::merge_intervals()
    + 5 October 2018 upped to 3.2 r6 for corrected 'is_empty'
      return value
    + 28 September 2018 upped to 3.2 r5 for fix in extended
      classification writing
  + 3.2.2
    + A version number was not properly incremented to 3.2.1,
    necessitating a new release to eliminate confusion.
  + 3.2.1
    + Library SOVERSIONing for libtool to 8.0.0 #36
    + Update NEWS and ChangeLog
