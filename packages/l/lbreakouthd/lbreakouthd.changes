- Add lbreakouthd-user-hiscoredir.patch: Save hiscores to user
  config dir instead of global localstatedir; patch sent upstream
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/lgames/bugs/93/]. This also fixes an
  issue with openSUSE's pkg where the installed hiscores file was
  forced to be have '0664' perms instead of '0666', causing high
  scores to not be saved at all.
- Drop hiscores.hscr file installed to _localstatedir, as it is no
  longer used in light of above patch.

- Update to version 1.0.8:
  * The paddle if controlled by keys or game pad now has a slight
    acceleration instead of going to maximum speed instantly as
    before. This makes minor adjustments of the position much
    easier and allows for a pretty nice control of the paddle now.
  * A minor bug in the levelset selection dialog was fixed
  * Cross compiling instructions were improved.
