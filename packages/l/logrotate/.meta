  <title>Rotate, compress, remove, and mail system log files</title>
  <description>The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of log
files on a system that generates a lot of log files. Logrotate allows
the automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files.
Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly, or
when the log file reaches a certain size. Normally, logrotate runs as a
daily cron job.</description>
