  * Bug Fixes
    + LUCENE-9580: Fix bug in the polygon tessellator when
      introducing collinear edges during polygon splitting.
    + LUCENE-10470: Check if polygon has been successfully
      tessellated before we fail (we are failing some valid
      tessellations) and allow filtering edges that fold on top of
      the previous one.
    + LUCENE-10563: Fix failure to tessellate complex polygon.
    + LUCENE-10678: Fix potential overflow when building a BKD tree
      with more than 4 billion points. The overflow occurs when

- Upgrade to version 8.11.2
  * API Changes
    + LUCENE-9265: SimpleFSDirectory is deprecated in favor of
      NIOFSDirectory.
    + LUCENE-9304: Removed ability to set
      DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool on IndexWriterConfig.
      The DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool is a packaged protected final
      class which made it impossible to customize.
    + LUCENE-9339: MergeScheduler#merge doesn't accept a parameter
      if a new merge was found anymore.
    + LUCENE-9330: SortFields are now responsible for writing
      themselves into index headers if they are used as index sorts.
    + LUCENE-9340: Deprecate SimpleBindings#add(SortField).
    + LUCENE-9345: MergeScheduler is now decoupled from IndexWriter.
      Instead it accepts a MergeSource interface that offers the
      basic methods to acquire pending merges, run the merge and do
      accounting around it.
    + LUCENE-9349: QueryVisitor.consumeTermsMatching() now takes a
      Supplier<ByteRunAutomaton> to enable queries that build large
      automata to provide them lazily. TermsInSetQuery switches to
      using this method to report matching terms.
    + LUCENE-9366: DocValues.emptySortedNumeric() no longer takes a
      maxDoc parameter
    + LUCENE-7822: CodecUtil#checkFooter(IndexInput, Throwable) now
      throws a CorruptIndexException if checksums mismatch or if
      checksums can't be verified.
    + LUCENE-7020: TieredMergePolicy#setMaxMergeAtOnceExplicit is
      deprecated and the number of segments that get merged via
      explicit merges is unlimited by default.
    + LUCENE-9437: Lucene's facet module's
      DocValuesOrdinalsReader.decode method is now public, making it
      easier for applications to decode facet ordinals into their
      corresponding labels
    + LUCENE-9449: Field comparators for numeric fields and _doc
      were moved to their own package. TopFieldCollector sets
      TotalHits.relation to GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO, as soon as the
      requested total hits threshold is reached, even though in some
      cases no skipping optimization is applied and all hits are
      collected.
    + LUCENE-9515: IndexingChain now accepts individual primitives
      rather than a DocumentsWriterPerThread instance in order to
      create a new DocConsumer.
    + LUCENE-9680: Removed deprecation warning from
      IndexWriter#getFieldNames().
    + LUCENE-9902: Change the getValue method from IntTaxonomyFacets
      to be protected instead of private. Users can now access the
      count of an ordinal directly without constructing an extra
      FacetLabel. Also use variable length arguments for the
      getOrdinal call in TaxonomyReader.
    + LUCENE-9962: DrillSideways allows sub-classes to provide
      "drill down" FacetsCollectors. They may provide a null
      collector if they choose to bypass "drill down" facet
      collection.
    + LUCENE-10027: Add a new Directory reader open API from
      indexCommit and a custom comparator for sorting leaf readers
    + LUCENE-10036: Replaced the ScoreCachingWrappingScorer ctor
      with a static factory method that ensures unnecessary wrapping
      doesn't occur.
  * New Features
    + LUCENE-7889: Grouping by range based on values from
      DoubleValuesSource and LongValuesSource
    + LUCENE-8962: Add IndexWriter merge-on-commit feature to
      selectively merge small segments on commit, subject to a
      configurable timeout, to improve search performance by
      reducing the number of small segments for searching
    + LUCENE-8962: Add IndexWriter merge-on-refresh feature to
      selectively merge small segments on getReader, subject to a
      configurable timeout, to improve search performance by
      reducing the number of small segments for searching.
    + LUCENE-9378: Doc values now allow configuring how to trade
      compression for retrieval speed.
    + LUCENE-9385: Add FacetsConfig option to control which
      drill-down terms are indexed for a FacetLabel
    + LUCENE-9386: RegExpQuery added case insensitive matching
      option.
    + LUCENE-9413: Add CJKWidthCharFilter and its factory
    + LUCENE-9444: Add utility class to retrieve facet labels from
      the taxonomy index for a facet field so such fields do not
      also have to be redundantly stored
    + LUCENE-9484: Allow sorting an index after it was created.
      With SortingCodecReader, existing unsorted segments can be
      wrapped and merged into a fresh index using
      IndexWriter#addIndices API.
    + LUCENE-9507: Custom order for leaves in IndexReader and
      IndexWriter
    + LUCENE-9537: Added smoothingScore method and default
      implementation to Scorable abstract class. The smoothing score
      allows scorers to calculate a score for a document where the
      search term or subquery is not present. The smoothing score
      acts like an idf so that documents that do not have terms or
      subqueries that are more frequent in the index are not
      penalized as much as documents that do not have less frequent
      terms or subqueries and prevents scores which are the product
      or terms or subqueries from going to zero. Added the
      implementation of the Indri AND and the
      IndriDirichletSimilarity from the academic Indri search
      engine: http://www.lemurproject.org/indri.php.
    + LUCENE-9552: New LatLonPoint query that accepts an array of
      LatLonGeometries.
    + LUCENE-9553: New XYPoint query that accepts an array of
      XYGeometries.
    + LUCENE-9572: TypeAsSynonymFilter has been enhanced support
      ignoring some types, and to allow the generated synonyms to
      copy some or all flags from the original token
    + LUCENE-9574 A token filter to drop tokens that match all
      specified flags.
    + LUCENE-9575: PatternTypingFilter has been added to allow
      setting a type attribute on tokens based on a configured set
      of regular expressions
    + LUCENE-9594: FeatureField supports newLinearQuery that for
      scoring uses raw indexed values of features without any
      transformation.
    + LUCENE-9641: LatLonPoint query support for spatial
      relationships.
    + LUCENE-9694: New tool for creating a deterministic index to
      enable benchmarking changes on a consistent multi-segment
      index even when they require re-indexing.
    + LUCENE-9950: New facet counting implementation for general
      string doc value fields (SortedSetDocValues / SortedDocValues)
      not created through FacetsConfig
    + LUCENE-10035: The SimpleText codec now writes skip lists.
    + LUCENE-10083: Analyzer and stemmer for Telugu language
  * Improvements
    + LUCENE-9276: Use same code-path for updateDocuments and
      updateDocument in IndexWriter and DocumentsWriter.
    + LUCENE-9279: Update dictionary version for Ukrainian analyzer
      to 4.9.1
    + LUCENE-8050: PerFieldDocValuesFormat should not get the
      DocValuesFormat on a field that has no doc values.
    + LUCENE-9304: Removed ThreadState abstraction from
      DocumentsWriter which allows pooling of DWPT directly and
      improves the approachability of the IndexWriter code.
    + LUCENE-9324: Add an ID to SegmentCommitInfo in order to
      compare commits for equality and make snapshots incremental on
      generational files.
    + LUCENE-9342: TotalHits' relation will be EQUAL_TO when the
      number of hits is lower than TopDocsColector's numHits
    + LUCENE-9353: Metadata of the terms dictionary moved to its own
      file, with the '.tmd' extension. This allows checksums of
      metadata to be verified when opening indices and helps save
      seeks when opening an index.
    + LUCENE-9359: SegmentInfos#readCommit now always returns a
      CorruptIndexException if the content of the file is invalid.
    + LUCENE-9393: Make FunctionScoreQuery use ScoreMode.COMPLETE
      for creating the inner query weight when ScoreMode.TOP_DOCS
      is requested.
    + LUCENE-9392: Make FacetsConfig.DELIM_CHAR publicly accessible
    + LUCENE-9397: UniformSplit supports encodable fields metadata.
    + LUCENE-9396: Improved truncation detection for points.
    + LUCENE-9402: Let MultiCollector handle minCompetitiveScore
    + LUCENE-8574: Add a new ExpressionValueSource which will
      enforce only one value per name per hit in dependencies,
      ExpressionFunctionValues will no longer recompute already
      computed values
    + LUCENE-9416: Fix CheckIndex to print an invalid non-zero norm
      as unsigned long when detecting corruption.
    + LUCENE-9440: FieldInfo#checkConsistency called twice from
      Lucene50(60)FieldInfosFormat#read; Removed the (redundant?)
      assert and do these checks for real.
    + LUCENE-9446: In BooleanQuery rewrite, always remove
      MatchAllDocsQuery filter clauses when possible.
    + LUCENE-9501: Improve coverage for Asserting* test classes:
      make sure to handle singleton doc values, and sometimes
      exercise Weight#scorer instead of Weight#bulkScorer for
      top-level queries.
    + LUCENE-9511: Include StoredFieldsWriter in DWPT accounting
      to ensure that it's heap consumption is taken into account
      when IndexWriter stalls or should flush DWPTs.
    + LUCENE-9514: Include TermVectorsWriter in DWPT accounting to
      ensure that it's heap consumption is taken into account when
      IndexWriter stalls or should flush DWPTs.
    + LUCENE-9523: In query shapes over shape fields, skip points
      while traversing the BKD tree when the relationship with the
      document is already known.
    + LUCENE-9539: Use more compact datastructures to represent
      sorted doc-values in memory when sorting a segment before
      flush and in SortingCodecReader.
    + LUCENE-9458: WordDelimiterGraphFilter should order tokens at
      the same position by endOffset to emit longer tokens first.
      The same graph is produced.
    + LUCENE-5309: Optimize facet counting for single-valued
      SSDV / StringValueFacetCounts.
    + LUCENE-9023: GlobalOrdinalsWithScore should not compute
      occurrences when the provided min is 1.
    + LUCENE-9177: ICUNormalizer2CharFilter no longer requires
      normalization-inert characters as boundaries for incremental
      processing, vastly improving worst-case performance.
    + LUCENE-9455: ExitableTermsEnum should sample timeout and
      interruption check before calling next().
    + LUCENE-9662: Make CheckIndex concurrent by parallelizing
      index check across segments.
    + LUCENE-9663: Add compression to terms dict from
      SortedSet/Sorted DocValues.
    + LUCENE-9675: Binary doc values fields now expose their
      configured compression mode in the attributes of the field
      info.
    + LUCENE-9725: BM25FQuery was extended to handle similarities
      beyond BM25Similarity. It was renamed to CombinedFieldQuery to
      reflect its more general scope.
    + LUCENE-9877: Reduce index size by increasing allowable
      exceptions in PForUtil from 3 to 7.
    + LUCENE-9687: Hunspell support improvements: add API for
      spell-checking and suggestions, support compound words, fix
      various behavior differences between Java and C++
      implementations, improve performance
    + LUCENE-9917: The BEST_SPEED compression mode now trades more
      compression ratio in exchange of faster reads.
    + LUCENE-9935: Enable bulk merge for stored fields with index sort.
    + LUCENE-9944: Allow DrillSideways users to provide their own
      CollectorManager without also requiring them to provide an
      ExecutorService.
    + LUCENE-9945: Extend DrillSideways to support exposing
      FacetCollectors directly.
    + LUCENE-9946: Support for multi-value fields in
      LongRangeFacetCounts and DoubleRangeFacetCounts.
    + LUCENE-9965: Added QueryProfilerIndexSearcher and
      ProfilerCollector to support debugging query execution
      strategy and timing.
    + LUCENE-9981: Operations.getCommonSuffix/Prefix(Automaton) is
      now much more efficient, from a worst case exponential down to
      quadratic cost in the number of states + transitions in the
      Automaton. These methods no longer use the costly determinize
      method, removing the risk of TooComplexToDeterminizeException
    + LUCENE-9981: Operations.determinize now throws
      TooComplexToDeterminizeException based on too much "effort"
      spent determinizing rather than a precise state count on the
      resulting returned automaton, to better handle adversarial
      cases like det(rev(regexp("(.*a){2000}"))) that spend lots of
      effort but result in smallish eventual returned automata.
    + LUCENE-9983: Stop sorting determinize powersets unnecessarily.
    + LUCENE-10030: Lazily evaluate score in
      DrillSidewaysScorer.doQueryFirstScoring
    + LUCENE-10043: Decrease default for LRUQueryCache's
      skipCacheFactor to 10. This prevents caching a query clause
      when it is much more expensive than running the top-level
      query.
    + LUCENE-10103: Make QueryCache respect Accountable queries
  * Optimizations
    + LUCENE-9254: UniformSplit keeps FST off-heap.
    + LUCENE-8103: DoubleValuesSource and QueryValueSource now use a
      TwoPhaseIterator if one is provided by the Query.
    + LUCENE-9287: UsageTrackingQueryCachingPolicy no longer caches
      DocValuesFieldExistsQuery.
    + LUCENE-9286: FST.Arc.BitTable reads directly FST bytes. Arc is
      lightweight again and FSTEnum traversal faster.
    + LUCENE-7788: fail precommit on unparameterised log messages
      and examine for wasted work/objects
    + LUCENE-9273: Speed up geometry queries by specialising
      Component2D spatial operations. Instead of using a generic
      relate method for all relations, we use specialize methods for
      each one. In addition, the type of triangle is computed at
      deserialization time, therefore we can be more selective when
      decoding points of a triangle.
    + LUCENE-9087: Build always trees with full leaves and lower the
      default value for maxPointsPerLeafNode to 512.
    + LUCENE-9148: Points now write their index in a separate file.
    + LUCENE-9280: Add an ability for field comparators to skip
      non-competitive documents. Creating a TopFieldCollector with
      totalHitsThreshold less than Integer.MAX_VALUE instructs
      Lucene to skip non-competitive documents whenever possible.
      For numeric sort fields the skipping functionality works when
      the same field is indexed both with doc values and points.
      To indicate that the same data is stored in these points and
      doc values SortField#setCanUsePoints method should be used.
    + LUCENE-9395: ConstantValuesSource now shares a single
      DoubleValues instance across all segments
    + LUCENE-9447, LUCENE-9486: Stored fields now get higer
      compression ratios on highly compressible data.
    + LUCENE-9373: FunctionMatchQuery now accepts a "matchCost"
      optimization hint.
    + LUCENE-9510: Indexing with an index sort is now faster by not
      compressing temporary representations of the data.
    + LUCENE-9449: Enhance DocComparator to provide an iterator over
      competitive documents when searching with "after". This
      iterator can quickly position on the desired "after" document
      skipping all documents and segments before "after".
    + LUCENE-9021: QueryParser: re-use the LookaheadSuccess
      exception.
    + LUCENE-9346: WANDScorer now supports queries that have a
      'minimumNumberShouldMatch' configured.
    + LUCENE-9536: Reduced memory usage for OrdinalMap when a
      segment has all values.
    + LUCENE-9636: Faster decoding of postings for some numbers of
      bits per value.
    + LUCENE-9673: Substantially improve RAM efficiency of how
      MemoryIndex stores postings in memory, and reduced a bit of
      RAM overhead in IndexWriter's internal postings book-keeping
    + LUCENE-9827: Speed up merging of stored fields and term
      vectors for smaller segments.
    + LUCENE-9932: Performance improvement for BKD index building
    + LUCENE-9996: Improved memory efficiency of IndexWriter's RAM
      buffer, in particular in the case of many fields and many
      indexing threads.
    + LUCENE-10014: Lucene90DocValuesFormat was using too many bits
      per value when compressing via gcd, unnecessarily wasting
      index storage.
    + LUCENE-10022: Rewrite empty DisjunctionMaxQuery to
      MatchNoDocsQuery.
    + LUCENE-10031: Slightly faster segment merging for sorted
      indices.
    + LUCENE-10196: Improve IntroSorter with 3-ways partitioning
    + LUCENE-10481: FacetsCollector will not request scores if it
      does not use them
  * Bug Fixes
    + LUCENE-9300: Fix corruption of the new gen field infos when
      doc values updates are applied on a segment created externally
      and added to the index with IndexWriter#addIndexes(Directory).
    + LUCENE-9350: Partial reversion of LUCENE-9068; holding
      levenshtein automata on FuzzyQuery can end up blowing up query
      caches which use query objects as cache keys, so building the
      automata is now delayed to search time again.
    + LUCENE-9259: Fix wrong NGramFilterFactory argument name for
      preserveOriginal option
    + LUCENE-8849: DocValuesRewriteMethod.visit wasn't visiting its
      embedded query
    + LUCENE-9258: DocTermsIndexDocValues assumed it was operating
      on a SortedDocValues (single valued) field when it could be
      multi-valued used with a SortedSetSelector
    + LUCENE-9164: Ensure IW processes all internal events before it
      closes itself on a rollback.
    + LUCENE-8908: Return default value from objectVal when doc
      doesn't match the query in QueryValueSource
    + LUCENE-9133: Fix for potential NPE in TermFilteredPresearcher
      for empty fields
    + LUCENE-9309: Wait for #addIndexes merges when aborting merges.
    + LUCENE-9337: Ensure CMS updates it's thread accounting
      datastructures consistently. CMS today releases it's lock
      after finishing a merge before it re-acquires it to update the
      thread accounting datastructures. This causes threading issues
      where concurrently finishing threads fail to pick up pending
      merges causing potential thread starvation on forceMerge calls
    + LUCENE-9314: Single-document monitor runs were using the less
      efficient MultiDocumentBatch implementation.
    + LUCENE-9362: Fix equality check in
      ExpressionValueSource#rewrite. This fixes rewriting of inner
      value sources.
    + LUCENE-9405: IndexWriter incorrectly calls closeMergeReaders
      twice when the merged segment is 100% deleted.
    + LUCENE-9400: Tessellator might build illegal polygons when
      several holes share the shame vertex.
    + LUCENE-9417: Tessellator might build illegal polygons when
      several holes share are connected to the same vertex.
    + LUCENE-9418: Fix ordered intervals over interleaved terms
    + LUCENE-9443: The UnifiedHighlighter was closing the underlying
      reader when there were multiple term-vector fields. This was a
      regression in 8.6.0.
    + LUCENE-9478: Prevent DWPTDeleteQueue from referencing itself
      and leaking memory. The queue passed an implicit this
      reference to the next queue instance on flush which leaked
      about 500byte of memory on each full flush, commit or
      getReader call.
    + LUCENE-9427: Fix a regression where the unified highlighter
      didn't produce highlights on fuzzy queries that correspond to
      exact matches.
    + LUCENE-9467: Fix NRTCachingDirectory to use
      Directory#fileLength to check if a file already exists instead
      of opening an IndexInput on the file which might throw a
      AccessDeniedException in some Directory implementations.
    + LUCENE-9501: Fix a bug in
      IndexSortSortedNumericDocValuesRangeQuery where it could
      violate the DocIdSetIterator contract.
    + LUCENE-9401: Include field in ComplexPhraseQuery's toString()
    + LUCENE-9578: Fix TermRangeQuery when there is no upper bound
      and the lower bound is the empty string excluded. This would
      previously match no strings at all while it should match all
      non-empty strings.
    + LUCENE-9524: Fix NPE in SpanWeight#explain when no scoring is
      required and SpanWeight has null Similarity.SimScorer.
    + LUCENE-9508: DocumentsWriter was only stalling threads for 1
      second allowing documents to be indexed even the
      DocumentsWriter wasn't able to keep up flushing. Unless IW
      can't make progress due to an ill behaving DWPT this issue
      was barely noticeable.
    + LUCENE-9581: Japanese tokenizer should discard the compound
      token instead of disabling the decomposition of long tokens
      when discardCompoundToken is activated.
    + LUCENE-9595: Make Component2D#withinPoint implementations
      consistent with ShapeQuery logic.
    + LUCENE-9606: Wrap boolean queries generated by shape fields
      with a Constant score query.
    + LUCENE-9617: Fix per-field memory leak in
      IndexWriter.deleteAll(). Reset next available internal field
      number to 0 on FieldInfos.clear(), to avoid wasting FieldInfo
      references.
    + LUCENE-9635: BM25FQuery - Mask encoded norm long value in
      array lookup.
    + LUCENE-9642: When encoding triangles in ShapeField, make sure
      generated triangles are CCW by rotating triangle points before
      checking triangle orientation.
    + LUCENE-9661: Fix deadlock in TermsEnum.EMPTY that occurs when
      trying to initialize TermsEnum and BaseTermsEnum at the same
      time
    + LUCENE-9744: NPE on a degenerate query in
      MinimumShouldMatchIntervalsSource
      $MinimumMatchesIterator.getSubMatches().
    + LUCENE-9762: DoubleValuesSource.fromQuery (also used by
      FunctionScoreQuery.boostByQuery) could throw an exception when
      the query implements TwoPhaseIterator and when the score is
      requested repeatedly.
    + LUCENE-9791: BytesRefHash.equals/find is now thread safe,
      fixing a Luwak/Monitor bug causing registered queries to
      sometimes fail to match.
    + LUCENE-9870: Fix Circle2D intersectsLine t-value (distance)
      range clamp
    + LUCENE-9887: Fixed parameter use in RadixSelector.
    + LUCENE-9953: LongValueFacetCounts should count each document
      at most once when determining the total count for a dimension.
      Prior to this fix, multi-value docs could contribute a > 1
      count to the dimension count.
    + LUCENE-9958: Fixed performance regression for boolean queries
      that configure a minimum number of matching clauses.
    + LUCENE-9963: FlattenGraphFilter is now more robust when
      handling incoming holes in the input token graph
    + LUCENE-9964: Duplicate long values in a document field should
      only be counted once when using SortedNumericDocValuesFields
    + LUCENE-9967: Do not throw NullPointerException while trying
      to handle another exception in ReplicaNode.start
    + LUCENE-9988: Fix DrillSideways correctness bug introduced in
      LUCENE-9944
    + LUCENE-9991: Fix edge case failure in
      TestStringValueFacetCounts
    + LUCENE-9999: CombinedFieldQuery can fail with an exception
      when document is missing some fields.
    + LUCENE-10008: Respect ignoreCase in CommonGramsFilterFactory
    + LUCENE-10020: DocComparator should not skip docs with the same
      docID on multiple sorts with search after
    + LUCENE-10026: Fix CombinedFieldQuery equals and hashCode,
      which ensures query rewrites don't drop CombinedFieldQuery
      clauses.
    + LUCENE-10039: Correct CombinedFieldQuery scoring when there is
      a single field.
    + LUCENE-10046: Counting bug fixed in StringValueFacetCounts.
    + LUCENE-10060: Ensure DrillSidewaysQuery instances never get
      cached.
    + LUCENE-10070 Skip deleted docs when accumulating facet counts
      for all docs
    + LUCENE-10081: KoreanTokenizer should check the max backtrace
      gap on whitespaces.
    + LUCENE-10106: Sort optimization can wrongly skip the first
      document of each segment
    + LUCENE-10110: MultiCollector now handles single leaf collector
      that wants to skip low-scoring hits but the combined score
      mode doesn't allow it
    + LUCENE-10111: Missing calculating the bytes used of
      DocsWithFieldSet in NormValuesWriter
    + LUCENE-10116: Missing calculating the bytes used of
      DocsWithFieldSet and currentValues in
      SortedSetDocValuesWriter
    + LUCENE-10119: Sort optimization with search_after can wrongly
      skip documents whose values are equal to the last value of the
      previous page
    + LUCENE-10126: Sort optimization with a chunked bulk scorer can
      wrongly skip documents
    + LUCENE-10134: ConcurrentSortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts
      shouldn't share liveDocs Bits across threads
    + LUCENE-10154: NumericLeafComparator to define getPointValues
    + LUCENE-10208: Ensure that the minimum competitive score does
      not decrease in concurrent search
    + LUCENE-10477: Highlighter:
      WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extractWeightedSpanTerms to
      Query#rewrite multiple times if necessary
    + LUCENE-10564: Make sure SparseFixedBitSet#or updates
      ramBytesUsed
  * Documentation
    + LUCENE-9424: Add a performance warning to
      AttributeSource.captureState javadocs
  * Changes in runtime behaviour
    + LUCENE-9539: SortingCodecReader now doesn't cache doc values
      fields anymore. Previously, SortingCodecReader used to cache
      all doc values fields after they were loaded into memory.
      This reader should only be used to sort segments after the
      fact using IndexWriter#addIndices.
  * Other
    + LUCENE-9257: Always keep FST off-heap. FSTLoadMode, Reader
      attributes and openedFromWriter removed.
    + LUCENE-9272: Checksums of the terms index are now verified
      when LeafReader#checkIntegrity is called rather than when
      opening the index.
    + LUCENE-9270: Update Javadoc about normalizeEntry in the
      Kuromoji DictionaryBuilder.
    + LUCENE-9275: Make TestLatLonMultiPolygonShapeQueries more
      resilient for CONTAINS queries.
    + LUCENE-9244: Adjust
      TestLucene60PointsFormat#testEstimatePointCount2Dims so it
      does not fail when a point is shared by multiple leaves.
    + LUCENE-9271: ByteBufferIndexInput was refactored to work on
      top of the ByteBuffer API.
    + LUCENE-9191: Make LineFileDocs's random seeking more
      efficient, making tests using LineFileDocs faster
    + LUCENE-9338: Refactors SimpleBindings to improve type safety
      and cycle detection
    + LUCENE-9358: Change the way the multi-dimensional BKD tree
      builder generates the intermediate tree representation to be
      equal to the one dimensional case to avoid unnecessary tree
      and leaves rotation.
    + LUCENE-9288: poll_mirrors.py release script can handle HTTPS
      mirrors.
    + LUCENE-9232: Fix or suppress 13 resource leak precommit
      warnings in lucene/replicator
    + LUCENE-9398: Always keep BKD index off-heap. BKD reader does
      not implement Accountable any more.
    + LUCENE-9292: Refactor BKD point configuration into its own
      class.
    + LUCENE-9470: Make TestXYMultiPolygonShapeQueries more
      resilient for CONTAINS queries.
    + LUCENE-9512: Move LockFactory stress test to be a
      unit/integration test.
    + LUCENE-9637: Removes some unused code and replaces the Point
      implementation on ShapeField/ShapeQuery random tests.
    + LUCENE-9836: Removed the pure Maven build. It is no longer
      possible to build artifacts using Maven (this feature was no
      longer working correctly). Due to migration to Gradle for
      Lucene/Solr 9.0, the maintenance of the Maven build was no
      longer reasonable. POM files are generated for deployment to
      Maven Central only. Please use "ant generate-maven-artifacts"
      to produce and deploy artifacts to any repository.
    + LUCENE-9836: Migrate Maven tasks to use
      "maven-resolver-ant-tasks" instead of the no longer maintained
      "maven-ant-tasks".
    + LUCENE-9985: Upgrade jetty to 9.4.41
    + LUCENE-9976: Fix WANDScorer assertion error.
    + LUCENE-10098: Add docs/links to GermanAnalyzer describing how
      to decompound nouns
    + SOLR-14995: Update Jetty to 9.4.34

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  9 09:20:58 UTC 2020 - Fridrich Strba <fstrba@suse.com>

- Upgrade to version 8.5.0
  * API Changes:
    + LUCENE-9093: Change in behavior of the UnifiedHighlighter's
      LengthGoalBreakIterator that will yield Passages sized a
      little different due to the fact that the sizing pivot is now
      the center of the first match and not its left edge.
    + LUCENE-9116: PostingsWriterBase and PostingsReaderBase no
      longer support setting a field's metadata via a 'long[]'.
    + LUCENE-9116: The FSTOrd postings format has been removed.
    + LUCENE-8369: Remove obsolete spatial module.
    + LUCENE-8621: Refactor LatLonShape, XYShape, and all query and
      utility classes to core.
    + LUCENE-9218: XY geometries API works in float space.
    + LUCENE-9212: Intervals.multiterm() takes CompiledAutomaton
      rather than plain Automaton
    + LUCENE-9150: Restore support for dynamic PlanetModel in
      spatial3d.
    + LUCENE-9171: QueryBuilder.newTermQuery() and
      .newSynonymQuery() now take boost parameters.
    + LUCENE-9029: Deprecate SloppyMath toRadians/toDegrees in
      favor of Java Math.
    + LUCENE-8620: Add CONTAINS support for LatLonShape and XYShape.
    + LUCENE-9050: MultiTermIntervalsSource.visit() was not calling
      back to its visitor.
    + LUCENE-8909: IndexWriter#getFieldNames() method is used to
      get fields present in index. After LUCENE-8316, this method is
      no longer required. Hence, deprecate
      IndexWriter#getFieldNames() method.
    + LUCENE-8755: SpatialPrefixTreeFactory now consumes the
      "version" parsed with Lucene's Version class. The quad and
      packed quad prefix trees are sensitive to this. It's
      recommended to pass the version like you should do likewise
      for analysis components for tokenized text, or else changes to
      the encoding in future versions may be incompatible with older
      indexes.
    + LUCENE-8956: QueryRescorer now only sorts the first topN hits
      instead of all initial hits.
    + LUCENE-8921: IndexSearcher.termStatistics() no longer takes a
      TermStates; it takes the docFreq and totalTermFreq. And don't
      call if docFreq <= 0. The previous implementation survives as
      deprecated and final. It's removed in 9.0.
    + LUCENE-8990: PointValues#estimateDocCount(visitor) estimates
      the number of documents that would be matched by the given
      IntersectVisitor. THe method is used to compute the cost() of
      ScorerSuppliers instead of
      PointValues#estimatePointCount(visitor).
    + LUCENE-8865: IndexSearcher now uses Executor instead of
      ExecutorService. This change is fully backwards compatible
      since ExecutorService directly implements Executor.
    + LUCENE-8856: Intervals queries have moved from the sandbox to
      the queries module.
    + LUCENE-8893: Intervals.wildcard() and Intervals.prefix()
      methods now take BytesRef rather than String.
    + LUCENE-3041: A query introspection API has been added.
      Queries should implement a visit() method, taking a
      QueryVisitor, and either pass the visitor down to any child
      queries, or call a visitX() or consumeX() method on it. All
      locations in the code that called Weight.extractTerms() have
      been changed to use this API, and the extractTerms() method
      has been deprecated.
    + LUCENE-8735: Directory.getPendingDeletions is now abstract to
      ensure subclasses override it. FilterDirectory now delegates
      the call, ensuring correct default behaviour for subclasses.
    + LUCENE-8662: TermsEnum.seekExact(BytesRef) to abstract and
      delegate seekExact(BytesRef) in
      FilterLeafReader.FilterTermsEnum.
    + LUCENE-8469: Deprecated StringHelper.compare has been removed.
    + LUCENE-8039: Introduce a "delta distance" method set to
      GeoDistance. This allows distance calculations, especially for
      paths, to take into account an "excursion" to include the
      specified point.
    + LUCENE-8007: Index statistics Terms.getSumDocFreq(),
      Terms.getDocCount() are now required to be stored by codecs.
      Additionally, TermsEnum.totalTermFreq() and
      Terms.getSumTotalTermFreq() are now required: if frequencies
      are not stored they are equal to TermsEnum.docFreq() and
      Terms.getSumDocFreq(), respectively, because all freq() values
      equal 1.
    + LUCENE-8038: Deprecated PayloadScoreQuery constructors have
      been removed
    + LUCENE-8014: Similarity.computeSlopFactor() and
      Similarity.computePayloadFactor() have been removed
    + LUCENE-7996: Queries are now required to produce positive
      scores.
    + LUCENE-8099: CustomScoreQuery, BoostedQuery and BoostingQuery
      have been removed
    + LUCENE-8012: Explanation now takes Number rather than float
    + LUCENE-8116: SimScorer now only takes a frequency and a norm
      as per-document scoring factors.
    + LUCENE-8113: TermContext has been renamed to TermStates, and
      can now be constructed lazily if term statistics are not
      required
    + LUCENE-8242: Deprecated method
      IndexSearcher#createNormalizedWeight() has been removed
    + LUCENE-8267: Memory codecs removed from the codebase
      (MemoryPostings, MemoryDocValues).
    + LUCENE-8144: Moved QueryCachingPolicy.ALWAYS_CACHE to the
      test framework.
    + LUCENE-8356: StandardFilter and StandardFilterFactory have
      been removed
    + LUCENE-8373: StandardAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORD_SET has been
      removed
    + LUCENE-8388: Unused PostingsEnum#attributes() method has been
      removed
    + LUCENE-8405: TopDocs.maxScore is removed. IndexSearcher and
      TopFieldCollector no longer have an option to compute the
      maximum score when sorting by field.
    + LUCENE-8411: TopFieldCollector no longer takes a fillFields
      option, it now always fills fields.
    + LUCENE-8412: TopFieldCollector no longer takes a
      trackDocScores option. Scores need to be set on top hits via
      TopFieldCollector#populateScores instead.
    + LUCENE-6228: A new Scorable abstract class has been added,
      containing only those methods from Scorer that should be
      called from Collectors. LeafCollector.setScorer() now takes a
      Scorable rather than a Scorer.
    + LUCENE-8475: Deprecated constants have been removed from
      RamUsageEstimator.
    + LUCENE-8483: Scorers may no longer take null as a Weight
    + LUCENE-8352: TokenStreamComponents is now final, and can take
      a Consumer<Reader> in its constructor
    + LUCENE-8498: LowerCaseTokenizer has been removed, and
      CharTokenizer no longer takes a normalizer function.
    + LUCENE-7875: Moved MultiFields static methods out of the
      class. getLiveDocs is now in MultiBits which is now public.
      getMergedFieldInfos and getIndexedFields are now in
      FieldInfos. getTerms is now in MultiTerms.
      getTermPositionsEnum and getTermDocsEnum were collapsed and
      renamed to just getTermPostingsEnum and moved to MultiTerms.
    + LUCENE-8513: MultiFields.getFields is now removed. Please
      avoid this class, and Fields in general, when possible.
    + LUCENE-8497: MultiTermAwareComponent has been removed, and in
      its place TokenFilterFactory and CharFilterFactory now expose
      type-safe normalize() methods. This decouples normalization
      from tokenization entirely.
    + LUCENE-8597: IntervalIterator now exposes a gaps() method
      that reports the number of gaps between its component
      sub-intervals. This can be used in a new filter available via
      Intervals.maxgaps().
    + LUCENE-8609: Remove IndexWriter#numDocs() and
      IndexWriter#maxDoc() in favor of IndexWriter#getDocStats().
  * Changes in Runtime Behavior
    + LUCENE-8671: Load FST off-heap also for ID-like fields if
      reader is not opened from an IndexWriter.
    + LUCENE-8730: WordDelimiterGraphFilter always emits its
      original token first. This brings its behaviour into line with
      the deprecated WordDelimiterFilter, so that the only
      difference in output between the two is in the position length
      attribute.
    + LUCENE-7386: Disjunctions nested in disjunctions are now
      flattened. This might trigger changes in the produced scores
      due to changes to the order in which scores of sub clauses are
      summed up.
    + LUCENE-8756: MoreLikeThisQuery now respects custom term
      frequencies (TermFrequencyAttribute) at search time
    + LUCENE-8333: Switch MoreLikeThis.setMaxDocFreqPct to use
      maxDoc instead of numDocs.
    + LUCENE-7837: Indices that were created before the previous
      major version will now fail to open even if they have been
      merged with the previous major version.
    + LUCENE-8020: Similarities are no longer passed terms that
      don't exist by queries such as SpanOrQuery, so scoring
      formulas no longer require divide-by-zero hacks.
      IndexSearcher.termStatistics/collectionStatistics return null
      instead of returning bogus values for a non-existent term or
      field.
    + LUCENE-7996: FunctionQuery and FunctionScoreQuery now return
      a score of 0 when the function produces a negative value.
    + LUCENE-8116: Similarities now score fields that omit norms as
      if the norm was 1. This might change score values on fields
      that omit norms.
    + LUCENE-8134: Index options are no longer automatically
      downgraded.
    + LUCENE-8031: Length normalization correctly reflects omission
      of term frequencies.
    + LUCENE-7444: StandardAnalyzer no longer defaults to removing
      English stopwords
    + LUCENE-8060: IndexSearcher's search and searchAfter methods
      now only compute total hit counts accurately up to 1,000 in
      order to enable top-hits optimizations such as block-max WAND
      (LUCENE-8135).
    + LUCENE-8505: IndexWriter#addIndices will now fail if the
      target index is sorted but the candidate is not.
    + LUCENE-8535: Highlighter and FVH doesn't support ToParent and
      ToChildBlockJoinQuery out of the box anymore. In order to
      highlight on Block-Join Queries a custom
      WeightedSpanTermExtractor / FieldQuery should be used.
    + LUCENE-8563: BM25 scores don't include the (k1+1) factor in
      their numerator anymore. This doesn't affect ordering as this
      is a constant factor which is the same for every document.
    + LUCENE-8509: WordDelimiterGraphFilter will no longer set the
      offsets of internal tokens by default, preventing a number of
      bugs when the filter is chained with tokenfilters that change
      the length of their tokens
    + LUCENE-8633: IntervalQuery scores do not use term weighting
      any more, the score is instead calculated as a function of the
      sloppy frequency of the matching intervals.
    + LUCENE-8635: FSTs can now remain off-heap, accessed via
      IndexInput, and the default codec's term dictionary
      (BlockTreeTermsReader) will now leave the FST for the terms
      index off-heap for non-primary-key fields using MMapDirectory,
      reducing heap usage for such fields.
  * New Features:
    + LUCENE-8903: Add LatLonShape and XYShape point query.
    + LUCENE-8707: Add LatLonShape and XYShape distance query.
    + LUCENE-9238: New XYPointField field and Queries for indexing,
      searching and sorting cartesian points.
    + LUCENE-8936: Add SpanishMinimalStemFilter
    + LUCENE-8764 LUCENE-8945: Add "export all terms and doc freqs"
      feature to Luke with delimiters.
    + LUCENE-8747: Composite Matches from multiple subqueries now
      allow access to their submatches, and a new NamedMatches API
      allows marking of subqueries and a simple way to find which
      subqueries have matched on a given document
    + LUCENE-8769: Introduce Range Query For Multiple Connected
      Ranges
    + LUCENE-8960: Introduce LatLonDocValuesPointInPolygonQuery for
      LatLonDocValuesField
    + LUCENE-8753: New UniformSplitPostingsFormat (name
      "UniformSplit") primarily benefiting in simplicity and
      extensibility. New STUniformSplitPostingsFormat (name
      "SharedTermsUniformSplit") that shares a single internal term
      dictionary across fields.
    + LUCENE-8632: New XYShape Field and Queries for indexing and
      searching general cartesian geometries.
    + LUCENE-8891: Snowball stemmer/analyzer for the Estonian
      language.
    + LUCENE-8815: Provide a DoubleValues implementation for
      retrieving the value of features without requiring a separate
      numeric field. Note that as feature values are stored with
      only 8 bits of mantissa the values returned may have a delta
      from the original values indexed.
    + LUCENE-8803: Provide a FeatureSortfield to allow sorting
      search hits by descending value of a feature. This is exposed
      via the factory method FeatureField#newFeatureSort.
    + LUCENE-8784: The KoreanTokenizer now preserves punctuations
      if discardPunctuation is set to false (defaults to true).
    + LUCENE-8812: Add new KoreanNumberFilter that can change
      Hangul character to number and process decimal point. It is
      similar to the JapaneseNumberFilter.
    + LUCENE-8362: Add doc-value support to range fields.
    + LUCENE-8766: Add monitor subproject (previously Luwak
      monitoring library). This allows a stream of documents to be
      matched against a set of registered queries in an efficien
      manner, for use as a monitoring or classification tool.
    + LUCENE-7714: Add a numeric range query in sandbox that takes
      advantage of index sorting.
    + LUCENE-8859: The completion suggester's postings format now
      have an option to load its internal FST off-heap.
    + LUCENE-2562: The well-known graphical user interface for
      inspecting Lucene indexes "Luke" was added as a Lucene module.
      It can be started from the binary distribution by calling the
      shell scripts in the module folder or from the source checkout
      by using 'ant -f lucene/luke/build.xml run'. Luke provides a
      Swing-based user interface and can be used to open Lucene or
      Solr (or Elasticsearch) indexes, inspect documents, check
      index commits and segments, or test (custom) analyzers. It
      also has maintenance functions to check index structures and
      force merge indexes for archival.
    + LUCENE-8340: LongPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery may be used to
      boost scores based on how close a value of a long field is
      from a configurable origin. This is typically useful to boost
      by recency.
    + LUCENE-8482: LatLonPoint#newDistanceFeatureQuery may be used
      to boost scores based on the haversine distance of a
      LatLonPoint field to a provided point. This is typically
      useful to boost by distance.
    + LUCENE-8216: Added a new BM25FQuery in sandbox to blend
      statistics across several fields using the BM25F formula.
    + LUCENE-8564: GraphTokenFilter is an abstract class useful for
      token filters that need to read-ahead in the token stream and
      take into account graph structures. This also changes
      FixedShingleFilter to extend GraphTokenFilter
    + LUCENE-8612: Intervals.extend() treats an interval as if it
      covered a wider span than it actually does, allowing users to
      force minimum gaps between intervals in a phrase.
    + LUCENE-8629: New interval functions: Intervals.before(),
      Intervals.after(), Intervals.within() and
      Intervals.overlapping().
    + LUCENE-8622: Adds a minimum-should-match interval function
      that produces intervals spanning a subset of a set of sources.
    + LUCENE-8645: Intervals.fixField() allows you to report
      intervals from one field as if they came from another.
    + LUCENE-8646: New interval functions: Intervals.prefix() and
      Intervals.wildcard()
    + LUCENE-8655: Add a getter in FunctionScoreQuery class in
      order to access to the underlying DoubleValuesSource.
    + LUCENE-8697: GraphTokenStreamFiniteStrings correctly handles
      side paths containing gaps
    + LUCENE-8702: Simplify intervals returned from vararg
      Intervals factory methods
  * Improvements:
    + LUCENE-9149: Increase data dimension limit in BKD.
    + LUCENE-9102: Add maxQueryLength option to DirectSpellchecker.
    + LUCENE-9091: UnifiedHighlighter HTML escaping should only
      escape essentials
    + LUCENE-9105: UniformSplit postings format detects corrupted
      index and better handles IO exceptions.
    + LUCENE-9106: UniformSplit postings format allows extension of
      block/line serializers.
    + LUCENE-9093: UnifiedHighlighter's LengthGoalBreakIterator has
      a new fragmentAlignment option to better center the first
      match in the passage. Also the sizing point now pivots at the
      center of the first match term and not its left edge. This
      yields Passages that won't be identical to the previous
      behavior.
    + LUCENE-9153: Allow WhitespaceAnalyzer to set a maxTokenLength
      other than the default of 255
    + LUCENE-9152: Improve line intersections with polygons when
      they are touching from the outside.
    + LUCENE-9123: Add new JapaneseTokenizer constructors with
      discardCompoundToken option that controls whether the
      tokenizer emits original (compound) tokens when the mode is
      not NORMAL.
    + UCENE-9253: KoreanTokenizer now supports custom
      dictionaries(system, unknown).
    + LUCENE-9171: QueryBuilder can now use BoostAttributes on
      input token streams to selectively boost particular terms or
      synonyms in parsed queries.
    + LUCENE-9002: Skip costly caching clause in LRUQueryCache if
      it makes the query many times slower.
    + LUCENE-9006: WordDelimiterGraphFilter's catenateAll token is
      now ordered before any token parts, like WDF did.
    + LUCENE-9028: introducing Intervals.multiterm()
    + LUCENE-9018: ConcatenateGraphFilter now has a configurable
      separator.
    + LUCENE-9036: ExitableDirectoryReader may interupt scaning
      over DocValues
    + LUCENE-9062: QueryVisitor now has a consumeTermsMatching()
      method, allowing queries that match a class of terms to pass a
      ByteRunAutomaton matching those that class back to the visitor.
    + LUCENE-9073: IntervalQuery to respond field on toString() and
      explain()
    + LUCENE-8874: Show SPI names instead of class names in Luke
      Analysis tab.
    + LUCENE-8894: Add APIs to find SPI names for
      Tokenizer/CharFilter/TokenFilter factory classes.
    + LUCENE-8914: move the logic for discarding inner modes in
      FloatPointNearestNeighbor to the IntersectVisitor so we take
      advantage of the change introduced in LUCENE-7862.
    + LUCENE-8955: move the logic for discarding inner modes in
      LatLonPoint NearestNeighbor to the IntersectVisitor so we take
      advantage of the change introduced in LUCENE-7862.
    + LUCENE-8918: PhraseQuery throws exceptions at construction
      time if it is passed null arguments.
    + LUCENE-8916: GraphTokenStreamFiniteStrings preserves all
      Token attributes through its finite strings TokenStreams
    + LUCENE-8933: Check kuromoji user dictionary beforehand to
      avoid unexpected runtime exceptions. (Tomoko Uchida
    + LUCENE-8906: Expose Lucene50PostingsFormat.IntBlockTermState
      as public so that other postings formats can re-use it.
    + LUCENE-8942: Remove redundant parameters and improve
      visibility strictness in LRUQueryCache
    + SOLR-13663: Introduce <SpanPositionRange> into XML Query
      Parser
    + LUCENE-8952: Use a sort key instead of true distance in
      NearestNeighbor
    + LUCENE-8620: Tessellator labels the edges of the generated
      triangles whether they belong to the original polygon. This
      information is added to the triangle encoding.
    + LUCENE-8964: Fix geojson shape parsing on string arrays in
      properties
    + LUCENE-8976: Use exact distance between point and bounding
      rectangle in FloatPointNearestNeighbor.
    + LUCENE-8966: The Korean analyzer now splits tokens on
      boundaries between digits and alphabetic characters.
    + LUCENE-8984: MoreLikeThis MLT is biased for uncommon fields
    + LUCENE-7840: Non-scoring BooleanQuery now removes SHOULD
      clauses before building the scorer supplier as opposed to
      eliminating them during scoring construction.
    + LUCENE-8770: BlockMaxConjunctionScorer now leverages
      two-phase iterators in order to avoid executing the second
      phase when scorers don't intersect.
    + LUCENE-8781: FST lookup performance has been improved in many
      cases by encoding Arcs using full-sized arrays with gaps. The
      new encoding is enabled for postings in the default codec and
      for suggesters.
    + LUCENE-8818: Fix smokeTestRelease.py encoding bug
    + LUCENE-8845: Allow Intervals.prefix() and
      Intervals.wildcard() to specify their maximum allowed expansions
    + LUCENE-8875: Introduce a Collector optimized for use cases
      when large number of hits are requested
    + LUCENE-8848 LUCENE-7757 LUCENE-8492: The UnifiedHighlighter
      now detects that parts of the query are not understood by it,
      and thus it should not make optimizations that result in no
      highlights or slow highlighting. This generally works best for
      WEIGHT_MATCHES mode. Consequently queries produced by
      ComplexPhraseQueryParser and the surround QueryParser will now
      highlight correctly.
    + LUCENE-8793: Luke enhanced UI for CustomAnalyzer: show
      detailed analysis steps.
    + LUCENE-8855: Add Accountable to some Query implementations
    + LUCENE-8673: Use radix partitioning when merging dimensional
      points instead of sorting all dimensions before hand.
    + LUCENE-8687: Optimise radix partitioning for points on heap.
    + LUCENE-8699: Change HeapPointWriter to use a single byte
      array instead to a list of byte arrays. In addition a new
      interface PointValue is added to abstract out the different
      formats between offline and on-heap writers.
    + LUCENE-8703: Build point writers in the BKD tree only when
      they are needed.
    + LUCENE-8652: SynonymQuery can now deboost the document
      frequency of each term when blending the score of the synonym.
    + LUCENE-8631: The Korean's user dictionary now picks the
      longest-matching word and discards the other matches.
    + LUCENE-8732: ConstantScoreQuery can now early terminate the
      query if the minimum score is greater than the constant score
      and total hits are not requested.
    + LUCENE-8750: Implements setMissingValue() on sort fields
      produced from DoubleValuesSource and LongValuesSource
    + LUCENE-8701: ToParentBlockJoinQuery now creates a child
      scorer that disallows skipping over non-competitive documents
      if the score of a parent depends on the score of multiple
      children (avg, max, min). Additionally the score mode 'none'
      that assigns a constant score to each parent can early
      terminate top scores's collection.
    + LUCENE-8751: Weight#matches now use the ScorerSupplier to
      build scorers with a lead cost of 1 (single document).
    + LUCENE-8752: Japanese new era name '令和' (Reiwa) is added to
      the dictionary used in JapaneseTokenizer so that the analyzer
      handles the era name correctly. Reiwa is set to replace the
      Heisei Era on May 1, 2019.
    + LUCENE-8671: Introduced reader attributes allows a per
      IndexReader configuration of codec internals. This enables a
      per reader configuration if FSTs are on- or off-heap on a per
      field basis
    + LUCENE-8787: spatial-extras DateRangePrefixTree used to only
      parse ISO-8601 timestamps with 0 or 3 digits of milliseconds
      precision but now parses other lengths (although > 3 not
      used).
    + LUCENE-7997: Add BaseSimilarityTestCase to sanity check
      similarities. SimilarityBase switches to 64-bit doubles
      internally to help avoid common numeric issues. Add missing
      range checks for similarity parameters. Improve BM25 and
      ClassicSimilarity's explanations.
    + LUCENE-8011: Improved similarity explanations.
    + LUCENE-4198: Codecs now have the ability to index score
      impacts.
    + LUCENE-8135: Boolean queries now implement the block-max WAND
      algorithm in order to speed up selection of top scored
      documents.
    + LUCENE-8279: CheckIndex now cross-checks terms with norms.
    + LUCENE-8660: TopDocsCollectors now return an accurate count
      (instead of a lower bound) if the total hit count is equal to
      the provided threshold.
  * Optimizations
    + LUCENE-9211: Add compression for Binary doc value fields.
    + LUCENE-4702: Better compression of terms dictionaries.
    + LUCENE-9228: Sort dvUpdates in the term order before applying
      if they all update a single field to the same value. This
      optimization can reduce the flush time by around 20% for the
      docValues update user cases.
    + LUCENE-9245: Reduce AutomatonTermsEnum memory usage.
    + LUCENE-9237: Faster UniformSplit intersect TermsEnum.
    + LUCENE-9068: FuzzyQuery builds its Automaton up-front
    + LUCENE-9113: Faster merging of SORTED/SORTED_SET doc values.
    + LUCENE-9125: Optimize Automaton.step() with binary search and
      introduce Automaton.next().
    + LUCENE-9147: The index of stored fields and term vectors in
      now off-heap.
    + LUCENE-8928: When building a kd-tree for dimensions n > 2,
      compute exact bounds for an inner node every N splits to
      improve the quality of the tree. N is defined by
      SPLITS_BEFORE_EXACT_BOUNDS which is set to 4.
    + BaseDirectoryReader no longer sums up the
      'LeafReader#numDocs' of its leaves eagerly. This especially
      helps when creating views of readers that hide documents,
      since computing the number of live documents is an expensive
      operation.
    + LUCENE-8992: TopFieldCollector and TopScoreDocCollector can
      now share minimum scores across leaves concurrently.
    + LUCENE-8932: BKDReader's index is now stored off-heap when
      the IndexInput is an instance of ByteBufferIndexInput.
    + LUCENE-9024: IntroSelector now falls back to the median of
      medians algorithm instead of sorting when the maximum
      recursion level is exceeded, providing better worst-case
      runtime.
    + LUCENE-8920: The denser arcs of FST now index labels with a
      bitset in order to provide near constant time access.
    + LUCENE-9027: Use SIMD instructions to decode postings.
    + LUCENE-9049: Remove FST cached root arcs now redundant with
      labels indexed by bitset. This frees some on-heap FST space.
    + LUCENE-9045: Do not use TreeMap/TreeSet in BlockTree and
      PerFieldPostingsFormat.
    + LUCENE-8922: DisjunctionMaxQuery more efficiently leverages
      impacts to skip non-competitive hits.
    + LUCENE-8935: BooleanQuery with no scoring clause can now
      early terminate the query when the total hits is not requested.
    + LUCENE-8941: Matches on wildcard queries will defer building
      their full disjunction until a MatchesIterator is pulled
    + LUCENE-8755: spatial-extras quad and packed quad prefix trees
      now index points faster.
    + LUCENE-8860: add additional leaf node level optimizations in
      LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery.
    + LUCENE-8968: Improve performance of WITHIN and DISJOINT
      queries for Shape queries by doing just one pass whenever
      possible.
    + LUCENE-8939: Introduce shared count based early termination
      across multiple slices
    + LUCENE-8980: Blocktree's seekExact now short-circuits false
      if the term isn't in the min-max range of the segment. Large
      perf gain for ID/time like data when populated sequentially.
    + LUCENE-8796: Use exponential search instead of binary search
      in IntArrayDocIdSet#advance method
    + LUCENE-8865: Use incoming thread for execution if
      IndexSearcher has an executor. Now caller threads execute at
      least one search on an index even if there is an executor
      provided to minimize thread context switching.
    + LUCENE-8868: New storing strategy for BKD tree leaves with
      low cardinality. It stores the distinct values once with the
      cardinality value reducing the storage cost.
    + LUCENE-8885: Optimise BKD reader by exploiting cardinality
      information stored on leaves.
    + LUCENE-8896: Override default implementation of
      IntersectVisitor#visit(DocIDSetBuilder, byte[]) for several queries.
    + LUCENE-8901: Load frequencies lazily only when needed in
      BlockDocsEnum and BlockImpactsEverythingEnum
    + LUCENE-8888: Optimize distribution of points with data
      dimensions in BKD tree leaves.
    + LUCENE-8311: Phrase queries now leverage impacts.
    + LUCENE-8040: Optimize IndexSearcher.collectionStatistics,
      avoiding MultiFields/MultiTerms
    + LUCENE-4100: Disjunctions now support faster collection of
      top hits when the total hit count is not required.
    + LUCENE-7993: Phrase queries are now faster if total hit
      counts are not required.
    + LUCENE-8109: Boolean queries propagate information about the
      minimum competitive score in order to make collection faster
      if there are disjunctions or phrase queries as sub queries,
      which know how to leverage this information to run faster.
    + LUCENE-8439: Disjunction max queries can skip blocks to
      select the top documents if the total hit count is not required.
    + LUCENE-8204: Boolean queries with a mix of required and
      optional clauses are now faster if the total hit count is not
      required.
    + LUCENE-8448: Boolean queries now propagates the mininum score
      to their sub-scorers.
    + LUCENE-8511: MultiFields.getIndexedFields is now optimized;
      does not call getMergedFieldInfos
    + LUCENE-8507: TopFieldCollector can now update the minimum
      competitive score if the primary sort is by relevancy and the
      total hit count is not required.
    + LUCENE-8464: ConstantScoreScorer now implements
      setMinCompetitveScore in order to early terminate the iterator
      if the minimum score is greater than the constant score.
    + LUCENE-8607: MatchAllDocsQuery can shortcut when total hit
      count is not required
    + LUCENE-8585: Index-time jump-tables for DocValues, for O(1)
      advance when retrieving doc values.
  * Bug Fixes
    + LUCENE-9084: Fix potential deadlock due to circular
      synchronization in AnalyzingInfixSuggester
    + LUCENE-9115: NRTCachingDirectory no longer caches files of
      unknown size.
    + LUCENE-9144: Fix error message on OneDimensionBKDWriter when
      too many points are added to the writer.
    + LUCENE-9135: Make UniformSplit FieldMetadata counters long.
    + LUCENE-9200: Fix TieredMergePolicy to use double (not float)
      math to make its merging decisions, fixing a corner-case bug
      uncovered by fun randomized tests
    + LUCENE-9099: Unordered and Ordered interval queries now
      correctly handle repeated subterms - ordered intervals could
      supply an 'extra' minimized interval, resulting in odd
      matches when combined with eg CONTAINS queries; and unordered
      intervals would match duplicate subterms on the same position,
      so an query for UNORDERED(foo, foo) would match a document
      containing 'foo' only once.
    + LUCENE-9250: Add support for Circle2d#intersectsLine around
      the dateline.
    + LUCENE-9243: Add fudge factor when creating a bounding box of
      a XYCircle.
    + LUCENE-9239: Circle2D#WithinTriangle detects properly if a
      triangle is Within distance.
    + LUCENE-9251: Fix bug in the polygon tessellator where edges
      with different value on #isEdgeFromPolygon were bot filtered
      out properly.
    + LUCENE-9263: Fix wrong transformation of distance in meters
      to radians in Geo3DPoint.
    + LUCENE-9001: Fix race condition in SetOnce.
    + LUCENE-9030: Fix WordnetSynonymParser behaviour so it behaves
      similar to SolrSynonymParser.
    + LUCENE-9054: Fix reproduceJenkinsFailures.py to not overwrite
      junit XML files when retrying
    + LUCENE-9031: UnsupportedOperationException on
      MatchesIterator.getQuery()
    + LUCENE-8996: maxScore was sometimes missing from distributed
      grouped responses.
    + LUCENE-9055: Fix the detection of lines crossing triangles
      through edge points.
    + LUCENE-9103: Disjunctions can miss some hits in some rare
      conditions.
    + LUCENE-8755: spatial-extras quad and packed quad prefix trees
      could throw a NullPointerException for certain cell edge
      coordinates
    + LUCENE-9005: BooleanQuery.visit() would pull subVisitors from
      its parent visitor, rather than from a visitor for its own
      specific query. This could cause problems when BQ was nested
      under another BQ. Instead, we now pull a MUST subvisitor, pass
      it to any MUST subclauses, and then pull SHOULD, MUST_NOT and
      FILTER visitors from it rather than from the parent.
    + LUCENE-8831: Fixed LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery .hashCode
      methods.
    + LUCENE-8775: Improve tessellator to handle better cases where
      a hole share a vertex with the polygon.
    + LUCENE-8785: Ensure new threadstates are locked before
      retrieving the number of active threadstates. This causes
      assertion errors and potentially broken field attributes in
      the IndexWriter when IndexWriter#deleteAll is called while
      actively indexing.
    + LUCENE-8804: Forbid calls to putAttribute on frozen FieldType
      instances.
    + LUCENE-8828: Removes the buggy 'disallow overlaps' boolean
      from Intervals.unordered(), and replaces it with a new
      Intervals.unorderedNoOverlaps() method
    + LUCENE-8843: Don't ignore exceptions that are thrown when
      trying to open a file in IOUtils#fsync.
    + LUCENE-8835: FileSwitchDirectory now respects the file
      extension when listing directory contents to ensure we don't
      expose pending deletes if both directory point to the same
      underlying filesystem directory.
    + LUCENE-8853: FileSwitchDirectory now applies best effort to
      place tmp files in the same directory as the target files.
    + LUCENE-8892: Add missing closing parentheses in
      MultiBoolFunction's description()
    + LUCENE-8736: LatLonShapePolygonQuery returns incorrect WITHIN
      results with shared boundaries. Point in Polygon now correctly
      includes boundary points. Box and Polygon relations with
      triangles have also been improved to correctly include
      boundary points.
    + LUCENE-8712: Polygon2D does not detect crossings through
      segment edges.
    + LUCENE-8720: NameIntCacheLRU (in the facets module) had an
      int overflow bug that disabled cleaning of the cache
    + LUCENE-8726: ValueSource.asDoubleValuesSource() could leak a
      reference to IndexSearcher
    + LUCENE-8719: FixedShingleFilter can miss shingles at the end
      of a token stream if there are multiple paths with different
      lengths.
    + LUCENE-8688: TieredMergePolicy#findForcedMerges now tries to
      create the cheapest merges that allow the index to go down to
      'maxSegmentCount' segments or less.
    + LUCENE-8477: Interval disjunctions could miss valid hits if
      some of the clauses of the disjunction are minimized away. We
      now rewrite intervals if a source contains a disjunction and
      the internal gaps matter for matching. This behaviour can be
      disabled if users are more interested in speed rather than
      accuracy of matching.
    + LUCENE-8741: ValueSource.fromDoubleValuesSource() was casting
      to Scorer instead of Scorable, leading to ClassCastExceptions
    + LUCENE-8754: Fix ConcurrentModificationException in
      SegmentInfo if attributes are accessed in MergePolicy while
      the merge is running
    + LUCENE-8765: Fixed validation of the number of added points
      in KD trees.

      expected them
    + LUCENE-8062: GlobalOrdinalsWithScoreQuery is no longer
      eligible for query caching.
