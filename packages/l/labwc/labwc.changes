-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to version 0.7.1
  + Added
    - Support libinput option sendEventsMode to allow
      enabling/disabling devices.
    - Add click method libinput option.
    - Add data/labwc.svg & data/labwc-symbolic.svg, and specify
      icon name in labwc.desktop to enable Display Managers to show
      an icons for labwc.
    - Expose output configuration test to clients.
      For example, this enables wlr-randr --dryrun
    - Add window-edge resistance for interactive moves/resizes and
      support negative strengths to indicate attractive snapping.
    - Set keyboard layout on reconfigure.
    - Reset keyboard-layout group (index) for each window on
      reconfigure if the keymap has changed.
    - Support merging multiple config files with the
      --merge-config command line option.
    - Add config option to map touch events to a named output
      (display). Optionally, make this only apply to specific named
      devices.
    - Add tablet support including:
      + Mapping of tablet to output (display)
      + Emulation of cursor movement and button press/release
      + Configuration of area and rotation
    - Add tearing support.
    - Add configuration support for mouse buttons Side, Extra,
      Forward, Back and Task.
    - config: allow <libinput><device> without category attribute
      to define a default profile because it is more user-friendly
      and intuitive.
    - Add a configuration option to enable adaptive sync only when
      an application is in fullscreen mode.
    - Add touchpad libinput device type to increase configuration
      flexibility, for example allowing naturalScroll on touchpads,
      but not on regular pointer devices such as mice.
    - Add actions:
      + AutoPlace
      + MoveToOutput, FitToOutput
      + Shade, Unshade, ToggleShade
    - Add config option <placement><policy> with supported values
      center, cursor and automatic. The latter minimizes overlap
      with other windows already on screen and is similar to
      Openbox's smart window placement.
  + Fixed
    - Delay popup-unconstrain until after first commit in response
      to a changed wlroots 0.17 interface and to get rid of the
      error message below.
    - Notify clients about configuration errors when changing
      output settings.
    - Fix output configuration bug causing compositor crash when
      refresh rate is zero.
    - Fix disappearing cursor bug on view destruction. Issue #1393
    - Use used specified config-file (using -c command line option)
      on reconfigure.
    - Assign outputs to new views on surface creation instead of
      mapping, and notify the client of the preferred output scale
      when doing so.
    - Fix crash when a minimized fullscreen window closes.
    - Execute menu actions after closing menus so that menu
      entries can issue wtype commands to the surface with
      keyboard-focus.
    - Try to honor original window geometry on layout changes.
    - Fix virtual keyboard bug experienced with wlrctl keyboard
      type xyz. Do not process virtual keyboard keycodes (just the
      keysyms).
    - Sync xdg-shell client view->pending when applying geometry
      to fix issue caused by applications choosing not respond to
      pending resize requests either by ignoring them or
      substituting alternative sizes (for example, when mpv
      constrains resizes to keep its aspect ratio fixed).
  + Changed
    - Make MoveToCursor honour <core><gap>.
    - Add Roll Up/Down client-menu entry for ToggleShade
    - When a Wayland-native window is snapped to a screen edges or
      user-defined region, labwc will notify the application that
      it is "tiled", allowing the application to better adapt its
      rendering to constrained layouts. Windows with client-side
      decorations may respond to these notices by squaring off
      corners and, in some cases, disabling resize abilities.
    - When a window is dragged from a snapped position (either a
      screen edge or a user-defined region), the snapped state is
      now discarded as soon as the dragging begins.
    - The new windowEdgeStrength setting makes windows resist
      interactive moves and resizes across the edges of other
      windows.
    - Run menu actions on button release intead of press.
    - Constrain window size to that of usable area when an
      application is started.
    - Support showing the full app_id in the window switcher. Users
      with a custom windowSwitcher configuration should use the
      trimmed_identifier field label to preserve existing behavior;
      the identifier field now refers to the full app_id. Consult
      the labwc-config(5) manual page for more details.
- Add hicolor-icon-theme BuildRequires: fix icons directory

- update to version 0.7.0
  + The main effort in this release has gone into porting labwc to
    wlroots 0.17 and tidying up regressions. Nonetheless, it
    contains a significant number of additions and fixes as
    described below. Should bug fixes be required against 0.6.6
    (built with wlroots 0.16), a 0.6 branch will be created.
  + Additions:
    - Support titlebar hover icons. Written-by: @spl237
    - Add theme options osd.workspace-switcher.boxes.{width,height}
      Written-by: @kyak
    - Add actions VirtualOutputAdd and VirtualOutputRemove to con-
      trol virtual outputs. Written-by: @kyak (gh#labwc/labwc#1287)
    - Teach MoveToEdge to move windows to adjacent outputs.
      Written-by: @ahesford
    - Implement <font place="InactiveWindow">. Written-by: @ludg1e
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1292)
    - Implement cursor-shape-v1 protocol to allow Wayland clients
      to request a buffer for a cursor shape from a compositor.
      Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Implement fractional-scale-v1 protocol to allow Wayland
      clients to properly scale on outputs with fractional scale
      factor. Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Add ResizeTo action (gh#labwc/labwc#1261)
    - Allow going backwards in window-switcher OSD by using
      arrow-up or arrow-left. Written-by: @jp7677
    - Add ToggleOmnipresent action and add an "Always on Visible
      Workspace" entry for it in the client-menu under the
      Workspaces submenu. Written-by: @bnason
    - Account for space taken up by XWayland clients with
      _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL property in the usable_area
      calculation. This increases inter-operability with X11
      desktop componenets.
    - Set XWayland's _NET_WORKAREA property based on usable area.
      XWayland clients use the _NET_WORKAREA root window property
      to determine how much of the screen is not covered by
      panels/docks. The property is used for example by Qt to
      determine areas of the screen that popup menus should not
      overlap.
  + Fixed:
    - Fix xwayland.c null pointer dereference causing crash with
      CLions. (gh#labwc/labwc#1352)
    - Fix issue with XWayland surfaces completely offscreen not
      generating commit events and therefore preventing them from
      moving onscreen.
    - Do not de-active windows when layer-shell client takes
      keyboard focus, to fix sfwbar minimize action.
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1342)
    - Move layer-shell popups from the background layer to the
      top layer to render them above normal windows. Previously
      this was only done for the bottom layer. In support of
      Raspberry Pi's pcmanfm --desktop. (gh#labwc/labwc#1293)
    - Calculate usable_area before positioning clients to ensure it
      is correct before non exclusive-zone layer-shell clients are
      positioned or resized. (gh#labwc/labwc#1285)
    - Prevent overriding XWayland maximized/fullscreen/tiled
      geometry to fix an issue where some XWayland views (example:
      xfce4-terminal) do not end up with exactly the correct
      geometry when tiled.
  + Changed:
    - Treat XWayland panel windows as if fixedPosition rule is set
    - Use the GTK3 notebook header color as the default active
      title color (small change from #dddad6 to #e1dedb).
