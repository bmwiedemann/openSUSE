- update to version 0.7.0
  + The main effort in this release has gone into porting labwc to
    wlroots 0.17 and tidying up regressions. Nonetheless, it
    contains a significant number of additions and fixes as
    described below. Should bug fixes be required against 0.6.6
    (built with wlroots 0.16), a 0.6 branch will be created.
  + Additions:
    - Support titlebar hover icons. Written-by: @spl237
    - Add theme options osd.workspace-switcher.boxes.{width,height}
      Written-by: @kyak
    - Add actions VirtualOutputAdd and VirtualOutputRemove to con-
      trol virtual outputs. Written-by: @kyak (gh#labwc/labwc#1287)
    - Teach MoveToEdge to move windows to adjacent outputs.
      Written-by: @ahesford
    - Implement <font place="InactiveWindow">. Written-by: @ludg1e
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1292)
    - Implement cursor-shape-v1 protocol to allow Wayland clients
      to request a buffer for a cursor shape from a compositor.
      Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Implement fractional-scale-v1 protocol to allow Wayland
      clients to properly scale on outputs with fractional scale
      factor. Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Add ResizeTo action (gh#labwc/labwc#1261)
    - Allow going backwards in window-switcher OSD by using
      arrow-up or arrow-left. Written-by: @jp7677
    - Add ToggleOmnipresent action and add an "Always on Visible
      Workspace" entry for it in the client-menu under the
      Workspaces submenu. Written-by: @bnason
    - Account for space taken up by XWayland clients with
      _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL property in the usable_area
      calculation. This increases inter-operability with X11
      desktop componenets.
    - Set XWayland's _NET_WORKAREA property based on usable area.
      XWayland clients use the _NET_WORKAREA root window property
      to determine how much of the screen is not covered by
      panels/docks. The property is used for example by Qt to
      determine areas of the screen that popup menus should not
      overlap.
  + Fixed:
    - Fix xwayland.c null pointer dereference causing crash with
      CLions. (gh#labwc/labwc#1352)
    - Fix issue with XWayland surfaces completely offscreen not
      generating commit events and therefore preventing them from
      moving onscreen.
    - Do not de-active windows when layer-shell client takes
      keyboard focus, to fix sfwbar minimize action.
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1342)
    - Move layer-shell popups from the background layer to the
      top layer to render them above normal windows. Previously
      this was only done for the bottom layer. In support of
      Raspberry Pi's pcmanfm --desktop. (gh#labwc/labwc#1293)
    - Calculate usable_area before positioning clients to ensure it
      is correct before non exclusive-zone layer-shell clients are
      positioned or resized. (gh#labwc/labwc#1285)
    - Prevent overriding XWayland maximized/fullscreen/tiled
      geometry to fix an issue where some XWayland views (example:
      xfce4-terminal) do not end up with exactly the correct
      geometry when tiled.
  + Changed:
    - Treat XWayland panel windows as if fixedPosition rule is set
    - Use the GTK3 notebook header color as the default active
      title color (small change from #dddad6 to #e1dedb).
