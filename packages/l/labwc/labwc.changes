- Update to version 0.8.0
  + The main focus in this release has been to port labwc to
    wlroots 0.18 and to grind out associated regressions.There are
    a couple of regression warnings when using wlroots 0.18:
    - There appears to be an issue with increased commit failures,
      particularly with intel drivers. If this turns out to be an
      issue for anyone please try running with WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1.
    - Fullscreen VRR is broken but should be fixed once wlroots
      0.18.1 is released.
  + Added
    - Add options fullscreen and fullscreenForced.
    - Optionally allow keybindings when session is locked, which
      for example can be useful for volume settings.
    - Add resistance when dragging tiled/maximized windows.
    - Implement support for renderer loss recovery.
    - Support xinitrc scripts to configure XWayland server on
      launch.

- Update to version 0.7.4
  + Fixed
    - Make SSD borders respect snapped state on Reconfigure.
    - Fix magnifier by disabling direct scanout when active.
    - Fix crash triggered by pipemenu without parent <menu>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 12 17:36:36 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.7.3
  + Added
    - Add config option `<core><xwaylandPersistence>` to support
      keeping XWayland alive even when no clients are connected.
    - Support xdg-shell protocol v3 with popup repositioning.
      which adds support on the wlroots side.
    - Add action `ToggleTabletMouseEmulation`.
    - Implement `<resize><drawContents>`.
    - Add `onRelease` option to `<keybind>` in support of binding
      `Super_L` to a menu.
    - Add initial support for `security-context-v1`
      (user configurable blocklists are still missing).
    - Add support for `tablet-v2-manager`.
    - Add action `UnMaximize`.
    - Support multiple IME popups.
    - Add `All` context for mouse bindings which need to be
      handled irrespective of the mouse pointer location. This
      enables Super+mouse-scroll to change magnification.
    - Add `SetDecorations` action.
    - Add `policy` option to `AutoPlace` action.
    - Add window type filter to If-actions.
    - Add screen magnifier which can be controlled with the
      `ZoomIn`, `ZoomOut` and `ToggleMagnify` actions.
  + Fixed
    - When looking for menu.xml, go through all paths rather than
      just giving up if not found in the first path searched.
      This makes it consistent with how other config/theme files
      are handled.
    - Fix memory leaks in theme.c and menu.c.
    - Fix session-lock bugs related to keyboard focus.
      + Clear focused surface on lock
      + Restore focused view on unlock
    - Fix memory leak in ssd/ssd-shadow.c
    - Respect `menu.overlap.x` when using pipemenus.
    - Do not try to restore windows to very small width/height on
      unmaximize.
    - Conditially set squared server-side decoration (SSD) corners
      when a view is tiled.
    - Remember initial direction when starting window-cycling with
      `PreviousView`. Also make the toggling of direction when
      shift is pressed relative to the initial direction.
    - Show dnd icon above layer-shell surfaces.
    - Initialize locale after reading environment files so that
      client-menu items and workspace names follow the env var
      `LANG` should that be set in `~/.config/labwc/environment`
      (which is not recommended, but we prefer to handle it
      properly if it is).
    - Fix crash on `menu.xml` containing `<item>` without a
      parent `<menu>`.
    - Reset XWayland cursor image on cursor theme reload to avoid
      trying to read destroyed pixel data.
    - Prevent child views from opening outside of usable area.
    - Fix IME popups issues (flicker when popup surface is
      initially mapped and incorrectly showing multiple popups).
    - Rate-limit cursor-driven resize events based on monitor's
      refresh rate. This fixes the lag when resizing windows of
      some apps on XWayland, for example Chromium and Steam.
    - Session-lock: fix flashing & update cursor shape.
    - Remove tearing-controller listeners on destroy.
    - Handle invalid `ForEach` and `If` action cofigs.
    - Delay startup of applications until event loop is ready.
    - With `SendToDesktop` action follow=no option, ensure the
      topmost window is focused.
    - Prevent XWayland from using incorrect keymap.
    - Allow keybinds containing the hyphen key to be defined
      with `-`.
    - Show/hide `top` layer more smartly. Before this commit,
      `top` layers were hidden whenever there was a fullscreen
      window in the corresponding output. With this commit,
      `top` layers are hidden only when there is a fullscreen
      window without other windows above it in the
      corresponding output.
  + Changed
    - Remove subprojects/seatd.wrap as no longer needed
    - Action `MoveToCursor` is deprecated in favour of:
      `<action name="AutoPlace" policy="cursor"/>`.
- Recommends alacritty instead foot as default terminal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 10 21:53:00 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.7.2
  + Added
    - Add <menu><ignoreButtonReleasePeriod> to prevent clicks with
      small movements from inadvertantly closing a menu or
      selecting a menu item.
    - Support drop-shadows (disabled by default) for windows using
      server-side decorations.
    - Add window-rule ignoreConfigureRequest to ignore X11
      client-side configure requests (positioning and resizing).
    - Support window-rules based on window type: 
      <windowRule type="">, where type can be for example
      NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP for an XWayland window.
    - Add none branch to the ForEach action.
    - Add -S|--session <command> option to start <command> on
      startup and to terminate the compositor when exits.
    - In theme setting color definitions, support inline alpha
      encoding like #aabbccff
    - Add window-switcher custom field inspired by printf
      formatting.
    - Support defining window-switcher width as a percentage of
      output (display) width.
    - Support Openbox compatible pipe-menus.
    - Add snap-to-edge overlay.
    - This includes the following new config and theme settings.
    - Add theme settings listed below for window-switcher preview
      border.
    - Support libinput config option for calibration matrices.
    - Add new window-switcher field content types workspace, state,
      type_short and output.
    - Support input methods.
    - Add atCursor attribute to action ShowMenu so that a window's
      "client-menu" could optionally be launched at the pointer
      using a keybind.
    - Support workspace-prefix (<desktops><prefix>) for workspace-
      switcher onscreen display when naming workspaces by digits.
    - Process all *.env files in an environment.d directory
      alongside and in the same way as each potential environment
      file.
    - Allow empty variables in environment files.
    - Add optional headless fallback output that is automatically
      created when no other output exists.
    - Optionally show windows on all workspaces in window-switcher.
    - Handle touch on headerbar using cursor emulate events.
    - Updated dbus activation environment with more environment
      variables.
    - Run shutdown script on exit
    - Add wrap argument to action MoveToOutput.
  + Fixed
    - Prevent Chromium from crashing when started after a virtual
      keyboard is destroyed.
    - Fix top-layer not showing when there is a minimized full-
      screen window.
    - Prevent the following whilst window-switcher cycling
    - Prevent shaded XWayland windows from getting cursor events.

    - Fix crash on Kill action with XWayland windows.
    - Update workspaces on --reconfigure.
    - Notify idle manager when emulating cursor movement.
    - Fix GrowToEdge/ShrinkToEdge action bug caused by clients
      ignoring the requested size, for example a terminal honouring
      size-hints. Fix assert() on VT switch.
    - Ensure titlebar has consistent look when using transparency.
    - Fix dnd bug where dnd does not finish properly on cursor-
      button-release if there is no surface under the cursor such
      as on the desktop when no background client is running.
    - Send cursor-button release event to CSD client before
      finishing window dragging to avoid a bug whereby the release
      event is incorrectly sent to a layer-shell client at the end
      of a drag.
    - Validate double-click against SSD part type because clicks on
      different parts of a client in quick succession should not be
      interpreted as a double click.
    - Fix bug that region overlay is not shown when a modifier key
      is re-pressed.
    - Fix workspace-switcher on-screen-display positioning of text
      using right-to-left (RTL) locales.
    - Unconstrain xdg-shell popups to usable area (rather than full
      output) so that popups do not cover layer-shell clients such
      as panels.
    - Exclude unfocusable XWayland windows.
    - Render text buffers with opaque backgrounds because subpixel
      text rendering over a transparent background does not work
      properly with cairo/pango.
    - Fallback on layout 'us' if a keymap cannot be created for the
      provided XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT. If keymap still cannot be
      created, exit with a helpful message instead of a segv crash.
    - Reload cursor theme and size on reconfigure.
    - Fix a number of surface-focus related short-comings.
    - Fix move/resize bug manifesting itself on touchpad taps.
    - Include always-on-top windows in window-switcher.
    - Make resize flicker free again when running labwc nested.
    - Clean up dbus and systemd activation environments on exit
    - Fix view_get_adjacent_output() bug resulting in often
      returning an incorrect output when using more than two
      outputs.
  + Changed
    - Support press-move-release when interacting with the labwc
      root-menu.
    - In theme settings, mark color definitions in the format use
      #rrggbbaa instead #rrggbb aaa (deprecated).
    - If your rc.xml contains a keybind to show menu "client-menu".
    - Change action MoveToOutput argument 'name' to 'output'
    - Do not deactivate window when giving keyboard focus to a non-
      view surface such as a popup or layer-shell surface. This
      matches Openbox behavior.
    - Treat Globally Active XWayland windows according to type to
      fix focus issues with IntelliJ IDEA and JDownloader 2.
    - Also revert f6e3527 which allowed re-focus between Globally
      Active XWayland windows of the same PID.
    - Only update dbus and systemd activation environments when
      running on the DRM backend or by explicit request using
      environment variable LABWC_UPDATE_ACTIVATION_ENV.

Sat Mar 16 22:47:44 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Enable xwayland feature

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar  1 22:59:40 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- Update to version 0.7.1
  + Added
    - Support libinput option sendEventsMode to allow
      enabling/disabling devices.
    - Add click method libinput option.
    - Add data/labwc.svg & data/labwc-symbolic.svg, and specify
      icon name in labwc.desktop to enable Display Managers to show
      an icons for labwc.
    - Expose output configuration test to clients.
      For example, this enables wlr-randr --dryrun
    - Add window-edge resistance for interactive moves/resizes and
      support negative strengths to indicate attractive snapping.
    - Set keyboard layout on reconfigure.
    - Reset keyboard-layout group (index) for each window on
      reconfigure if the keymap has changed.
    - Support merging multiple config files with the
      --merge-config command line option.
    - Add config option to map touch events to a named output
      (display). Optionally, make this only apply to specific named
      devices.
    - Add tablet support including:
      + Mapping of tablet to output (display)
      + Emulation of cursor movement and button press/release
      + Configuration of area and rotation
    - Add tearing support.
    - Add configuration support for mouse buttons Side, Extra,
      Forward, Back and Task.
    - config: allow <libinput><device> without category attribute
      to define a default profile because it is more user-friendly
      and intuitive.
    - Add a configuration option to enable adaptive sync only when
      an application is in fullscreen mode.
    - Add touchpad libinput device type to increase configuration
      flexibility, for example allowing naturalScroll on touchpads,
      but not on regular pointer devices such as mice.
    - Add actions:
      + AutoPlace
      + MoveToOutput, FitToOutput
      + Shade, Unshade, ToggleShade
    - Add config option <placement><policy> with supported values
      center, cursor and automatic. The latter minimizes overlap
      with other windows already on screen and is similar to
      Openbox's smart window placement.
  + Fixed
    - Delay popup-unconstrain until after first commit in response
      to a changed wlroots 0.17 interface and to get rid of the
      error message below.
    - Notify clients about configuration errors when changing
      output settings.
    - Fix output configuration bug causing compositor crash when
      refresh rate is zero.
    - Fix disappearing cursor bug on view destruction. Issue #1393
    - Use used specified config-file (using -c command line option)
      on reconfigure.
    - Assign outputs to new views on surface creation instead of
      mapping, and notify the client of the preferred output scale
      when doing so.
    - Fix crash when a minimized fullscreen window closes.
    - Execute menu actions after closing menus so that menu
      entries can issue wtype commands to the surface with
      keyboard-focus.
    - Try to honor original window geometry on layout changes.
    - Fix virtual keyboard bug experienced with wlrctl keyboard
      type xyz. Do not process virtual keyboard keycodes (just the
      keysyms).
    - Sync xdg-shell client view->pending when applying geometry
      to fix issue caused by applications choosing not respond to
      pending resize requests either by ignoring them or
      substituting alternative sizes (for example, when mpv
      constrains resizes to keep its aspect ratio fixed).
  + Changed
    - Make MoveToCursor honour <core><gap>.
    - Add Roll Up/Down client-menu entry for ToggleShade
    - When a Wayland-native window is snapped to a screen edges or
      user-defined region, labwc will notify the application that
      it is "tiled", allowing the application to better adapt its
      rendering to constrained layouts. Windows with client-side
      decorations may respond to these notices by squaring off
      corners and, in some cases, disabling resize abilities.
    - When a window is dragged from a snapped position (either a
      screen edge or a user-defined region), the snapped state is
      now discarded as soon as the dragging begins.
    - The new windowEdgeStrength setting makes windows resist
      interactive moves and resizes across the edges of other
      windows.
    - Run menu actions on button release intead of press.
    - Constrain window size to that of usable area when an
      application is started.
    - Support showing the full app_id in the window switcher. Users
      with a custom windowSwitcher configuration should use the
      trimmed_identifier field label to preserve existing behavior;
      the identifier field now refers to the full app_id. Consult
      the labwc-config(5) manual page for more details.
- Add hicolor-icon-theme BuildRequires: fix icons directory

Thu Jan 11 05:38:47 UTC 2024 - Muhammad Akbar Yanuar Mantari <mantarimay@pm.me>

- update to version 0.7.0
  + The main effort in this release has gone into porting labwc to
    wlroots 0.17 and tidying up regressions. Nonetheless, it
    contains a significant number of additions and fixes as
    described below. Should bug fixes be required against 0.6.6
    (built with wlroots 0.16), a 0.6 branch will be created.
  + Additions:
    - Support titlebar hover icons. Written-by: @spl237
    - Add theme options osd.workspace-switcher.boxes.{width,height}
      Written-by: @kyak
    - Add actions VirtualOutputAdd and VirtualOutputRemove to con-
      trol virtual outputs. Written-by: @kyak (gh#labwc/labwc#1287)
    - Teach MoveToEdge to move windows to adjacent outputs.
      Written-by: @ahesford
    - Implement <font place="InactiveWindow">. Written-by: @ludg1e
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1292)
    - Implement cursor-shape-v1 protocol to allow Wayland clients
      to request a buffer for a cursor shape from a compositor.
      Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Implement fractional-scale-v1 protocol to allow Wayland
      clients to properly scale on outputs with fractional scale
      factor. Written-by: @heroin-moose
    - Add ResizeTo action (gh#labwc/labwc#1261)
    - Allow going backwards in window-switcher OSD by using
      arrow-up or arrow-left. Written-by: @jp7677
    - Add ToggleOmnipresent action and add an "Always on Visible
      Workspace" entry for it in the client-menu under the
      Workspaces submenu. Written-by: @bnason
    - Account for space taken up by XWayland clients with
      _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL property in the usable_area
      calculation. This increases inter-operability with X11
      desktop componenets.
    - Set XWayland's _NET_WORKAREA property based on usable area.
      XWayland clients use the _NET_WORKAREA root window property
      to determine how much of the screen is not covered by
      panels/docks. The property is used for example by Qt to
      determine areas of the screen that popup menus should not
      overlap.
  + Fixed:
    - Fix xwayland.c null pointer dereference causing crash with
      CLions. (gh#labwc/labwc#1352)
    - Fix issue with XWayland surfaces completely offscreen not
      generating commit events and therefore preventing them from
      moving onscreen.
    - Do not de-active windows when layer-shell client takes
      keyboard focus, to fix sfwbar minimize action.
      (gh#labwc/labwc#1342)
    - Move layer-shell popups from the background layer to the
      top layer to render them above normal windows. Previously
      this was only done for the bottom layer. In support of
      Raspberry Pi's pcmanfm --desktop. (gh#labwc/labwc#1293)
    - Calculate usable_area before positioning clients to ensure it
      is correct before non exclusive-zone layer-shell clients are
      positioned or resized. (gh#labwc/labwc#1285)
    - Prevent overriding XWayland maximized/fullscreen/tiled
      geometry to fix an issue where some XWayland views (example:
      xfce4-terminal) do not end up with exactly the correct
      geometry when tiled.
  + Changed:
    - Treat XWayland panel windows as if fixedPosition rule is set
    - Use the GTK3 notebook header color as the default active
      title color (small change from #dddad6 to #e1dedb).
