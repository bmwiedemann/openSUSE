%description
lrslib is a library for the reverse search algorithm for vertex
enumeration/convex hull problems and comes with a choice of three
arithmetic packages. Input file formats are compatible with the
cddlib package. All computations are done exactly in either
multiple precision or fixed integer arithmetic. Output is not stored
in memory, so even problems with very large output sizes can
sometimes be solved.
