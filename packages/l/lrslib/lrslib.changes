Sat Jun  6 23:40:11 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 7.1
  * lrs: redund function is now performed by lrs via options, but
    legacy redund maintained.
  * lrs: extract option to extract columns from the input especially
    with linearities.
  * lrs: hvref makes a cross reference list between H and V
    representations.
  * mplrs: Temporary files no longer used for communicating with
    workers.
  * mplrs: Parallel version of redund is now available.
- Drop lrs-version.diff. Add lrs-types.diff.

Mon Nov  4 13:03:41 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 7.0a
  * Misplaced leaf test degraded performance and has been fixed.
  * Bug in volume computation in mplrs fixed.
  * Default cache limit set back to 10 to allow large parallel
    runs with low memory.
  * Reintroduced buffer for removing most duplicates when
    allbases option is set.
  * lrs1/2 on overflow no longer gives core dump.

- Update to upstream rerelease 7.0

Sat Oct 20 12:15:17 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 7.0
  * hybrid (64bit/128bit/GMP) arithmetic implemented:
  * speedups of roughly 3-5 times (64bit) and 2 times(128bit)
    over GMP for problems using small integers.
  * overflow checking for 64/128 bit arithmetic
  * __int128 (gcc v.4.6.0 or later) and FLINT arithmetic now supported
  * lrsgmp, mplrsgmp uses only GMP arithmetic, same as lrslib-062
  * lrs/redund/mplrs start in 64 bit moving to 128 bit and then
    to gmp arithmetic as necessary.
  * single arithmetic versions of lrs/mplrs available for
    comparison purposes.
  * single arithmetic versions of lrsnash are available with
    overflow checking.
  * plrs is no longer supported
  * removing the -DSAFE option disables overflow checking in
    64/128 bit mode and results are unpredicable if overflow
    occurs.
  * mplrs now prints maximum tree depth at end and supports
    printcobasis option in input files.
- Drop lrs-am.diff (no longer wanted). Add lrs-version.diff
  and lrs-128.diff.

Tue Feb 21 00:18:49 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 062
  * New command-line options -countonly, -stopafter <n>, -maxbuf <n>.
  * Volume output.
  * Counting statistics on number of jobs, size of L, number of
    times empty changed to longs.
  * Performance improvements for problems with large outputs.
