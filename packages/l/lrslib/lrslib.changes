- Update to release 7.3
  * lrs is now multithreaded with limited parallelization on a
    shared memory machine using OpenMP. lrs now evaluates in
    parallel all children of the root in the search tree.
  * minrep finds any hidden linearities and removes redundancy
    giving a H/V description with minimum number of rows.
  * `mplrs -minrep`: Fully parallelized version of minrep,
    replaces `mplrs -redund`.
  * `mplrs -fel` Does a fully parallel LP redundancy removal in
    one step of Fourier-Motzin elimination.
  * New features:
  * Checks equivalency between H/V representations (possibly
    after projections) using SMT solvers, see the polyv man page
    for details.

- Update to release 7.2
  * Projecting a polyhedron to a subset of its variables (Fourier
    elimination)
  * Determining if an inequality is redundant in computing the
    projection to a subset of its variables (uses SMT solver)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Update to release 7.1b
  * Fixed an issue where output can be lost in arithmetic change.
  * Place lrsrestart.h into buildroot upon `make install`.

Thu Dec 24 12:30:51 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 7.1a
  * Fixed memory leak in countonly option for mplrs/lrs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun  6 23:40:11 UTC 2020 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 7.1
  * lrs: redund function is now performed by lrs via options, but
    legacy redund maintained.
  * lrs: extract option to extract columns from the input especially
    with linearities.
  * lrs: hvref makes a cross reference list between H and V
    representations.
  * mplrs: Temporary files no longer used for communicating with
    workers.
  * mplrs: Parallel version of redund is now available.
- Drop lrs-version.diff. Add lrs-types.diff.

Mon Nov  4 13:03:41 UTC 2019 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to release 7.0a
  * Misplaced leaf test degraded performance and has been fixed.
  * Bug in volume computation in mplrs fixed.
  * Default cache limit set back to 10 to allow large parallel
    runs with low memory.
  * Reintroduced buffer for removing most duplicates when
    allbases option is set.
  * lrs1/2 on overflow no longer gives core dump.

- Update to upstream rerelease 7.0
  (replacing tarballs sucks, upstream!)

Sat Oct 20 12:15:17 UTC 2018 - Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

- Update to new upstream release 7.0
  * hybrid (64bit/128bit/GMP) arithmetic implemented:
  * speedups of roughly 3-5 times (64bit) and 2 times(128bit)
    over GMP for problems using small integers.
  * overflow checking for 64/128 bit arithmetic
  * __int128 (gcc v.4.6.0 or later) and FLINT arithmetic now supported
  * lrsgmp, mplrsgmp uses only GMP arithmetic, same as lrslib-062
  * lrs/redund/mplrs start in 64 bit moving to 128 bit and then
    to gmp arithmetic as necessary.
  * single arithmetic versions of lrs/mplrs available for
    comparison purposes.
  * single arithmetic versions of lrsnash are available with
    overflow checking.
  * plrs is no longer supported
  * removing the -DSAFE option disables overflow checking in
    64/128 bit mode and results are unpredicable if overflow
    occurs.
  * mplrs now prints maximum tree depth at end and supports
    printcobasis option in input files.
- Drop lrs-am.diff (no longer wanted). Add lrs-version.diff
  and lrs-128.diff.

- lrs-am.diff: add -lpthread for programs using boost_thread

Tue Feb 21 00:18:49 UTC 2017 - jengelh@inai.de

- Update to new upstream release 062
  * New command-line options -countonly, -stopafter <n>, -maxbuf <n>.
  * Volume output.
  * Counting statistics on number of jobs, size of L, number of
    times empty changed to longs.
  * Performance improvements for problems with large outputs.
