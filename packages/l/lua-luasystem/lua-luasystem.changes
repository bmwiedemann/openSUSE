- My effort to fix the test suite were unsuccesful, so let’s just
  switch of the tests for now.
- Split test phase as a special step to break luasystem-busted
  dependency cycle.
- Add unused_variable.patch to squelch two unused-variable warnings

- Change of the upstream project.
- Update to 0.6.3:
  - Fix: maximum key-delay, reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 seconds to
    reduce slugginess feel on some key presses. See #69.
  - Fix: readansi now only reports printable chars as characters
    See #70.
  - Fix: readkey now ignores Windows scancodes if received. See
    #74.
  - Fix: readkey now passes errors on. See #74.
- Update to 0.6.2:
  - Fix: autotermrestore didn't work because its metatable was
    overwritten.
- Update to 0.6.1:
  - Docs: document readansi internal buffer for incomplete
    sequences.
  - Fix: ensure to properly parse <alt>+key key presses
- Update to 0.6.0:
  - Fix: when sleep returns an error, pass that on in readkey.
  - Feat: added detachfds which will create separate file
    descriptions for stdout and stderr to ensure that related
    settings (eg. non-blocking flag) will not be shared amongst
    those streams and stdin.
- Update to 0.5.1:
  - Fix: on older unixes with glibc < 2.25, fall back to
    /dev/urandom
- Update to 0.5.0:
  - Feat: when detecting character display width, also accept
    unicode codepoints (integers), since the Lua utf8 library
    returns codepoints, not strings
  - Feat: allow passing in a sleep function to readkey and
    readansi
  - Fix: NetBSD fix compilation, undeclared directives
  - Refactor: random bytes; remove deprecated API usage on
    Windows, move to binary api instead of /dev/urandom file on
    linux and bsd
- Update to 0.4.5:
  - Fix: suppress a warning when building with clang
  - Fix: do not rely on luaconf.h to include limits.h, fixes
    builds with latest LuaJIT (#38).
- Update to 0.4.4:
  - Fix: include all objects in Makefile
- Update to 0.4.3:
  - Chore: add compiler error on Windows if Virtual Terminal
    Processing is unavailable.
  - Fix: fix the freebsd build

  - Fix: include additional headers for some MinGW installations
- Update to 0.4.1:
  - Fix: when compiling with msys2 the conio.h header is required
- Update to 0.4.0:
  - Feat: getconsoleflags and setconsoleflags for getting/setting
    the current console configuration flags on Windows
  - Feat: getconsolecp and setconsolecp for getting/setting the
    console codepage on Windows
  - Feat: getconsoleoutputcp and setconsoleoutputcp for
    getting/setting the console output codepage on Windows
  - Feat: tcgetattr and tcsetattr for getting/setting the current
    console configuration flags on Posix
  - Feat: getnonblock and setnonblock for getting/setting the
    non-blocking flag on Posix
  - Feat: bitflags: a support feature for the above flag type
    controls to facilitate bit manipulation without resorting to
    binary operations (to also support PuC Lua 5.1)
  - Feat: readkey reads a keyboard input from stdin in a
    non-blocking way (utf8, also on Windows)
  - Feat: readansi reads a keyboard input from stdin in a
    non-blocking way, parses ansi and utf8 sequences
  - Feat: termsize gets the current terminal size in rows and
    columns
  - Feat: utf8cwidth and utf8swidth for getting the display width
    (in columns) of respectively a single utf8 character, or a
    utf8 string
  - Feat: helpers; termbackup, termrestore, autotermrestore,
    and termwrap for managing the many terminal settings on all
    platforms.
- Update to 0.3.0:
  - Feat: on Windows sleep now has a precision parameter
  - Feat: setenv added to set environment variables.
