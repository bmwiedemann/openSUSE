  <title>Lightweight Text Editor and Notepad Clone</title>
  <description>Leafpad is a simple GTK+ based text editor. The user interface is
similar to &quot;notepad&quot;, and it aims to be lighter than GEdit and KWrite
and to be as useful as them.

Following features are intended...
- Minimum requirement: for portability
- Minimal menu item: to make full use of features and to learn easily
- No toolbar: to maximize area to view text
- Single document interface (SDI): to set out windows to view at a
  time
- Character coding auto detection: to open file quickly without
  multi-codeset problem
