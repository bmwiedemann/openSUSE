  <description>Many enviroments are switching from the Network Information Service (NIS) system over to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for sharing
their network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on the network.  NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages (YP).

This package implements several utilites that provide functional equivalents
to utilities from the yp-tools and util-linux-ng package.

Currently this includes: ldapcat, ldapmatch and ldapchsh.
