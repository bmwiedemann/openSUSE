%description
* A standalone binary that provides an easy way of installing, and uninstalling
  plugins from lite-xl, as well as different version of lite-xl.
* Can be used by a package manager plugin that works from inside the editor and
  calls this binary.
* Also contains a plugin_manager.lua plugin to integrate the binary with lite
  in the form of an easy-to-use GUI.
* By default in releases, lpm will automatically consume the manifest.json in
  the latest branch of this repository, which corresponds to the most recent versioned release.
* Conforms to SCPS3.
