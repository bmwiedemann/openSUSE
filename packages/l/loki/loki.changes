- also track quilt series file to make it easy to setup a quilt
  working copy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 10:35:08 UTC 2022 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- also make the config file permissions more strict:
  /etc/loki/loki.yaml     root:loki u=rw,g=r,o=
  /etc/loki/promtail.yaml root:root u=rw,g=r,o=

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 30 10:22:20 UTC 2022 - Marcus Rueckert <mrueckert@suse.de>

- default configs reference paths in /tmp. move those to proper
  places:
  loki data dir: /var/lib/loki loki:loki u=rwx,g=rx,o=
  promtail data dir: /var/lib/promtail root:root u=rwx,g=rx,o=

  Existing configs will not be updated

- Use BuildRequires: golang(API) = 1.17 instead of >=, 
  because with go1.18 it stop mmediately and rise up an error:
  "panic: Something in this program imports go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc to declare that it
  assumes a non-moving garbage collector, but your version of go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc

  run with environment variable ASSUME_NO_MOVING_GC_UNSAFE_RISK_IT_WITH=go1.18 set.
  Notably, if go1.18 adds a moving garbage collector, this program is unsafe to use."
