  <title>A GUI for backup &amp; synchronization based on rsync.</title>
  <description>... a powerful, fast and reliable backup &amp; sync tool
luckyBackup is an application that backs-up and/or synchronizes any directories with the power of rsync.

The advantage over similar applications is (apart from its simple interface) its ability to keep your data safe by checking all declared directories before proceeding in any data manipulation.</description>
