  <title>Tool for setting the special features of some Logitech mice</title>
  <description>lomoco can configure vendor-specific options on Logitech USB mice (or
dual-personality mice plugged into the USB port). A number of recent
devices are supported. The program is mostly useful in setting the
resolution to 800 cpi on mice that boot at 400 cpi (such as the
MX-500), and disabling SmartScroll or Cruise Control for those who
would rather use the two extra buttons as ordinary mouse buttons.

You can configure which features should be enabled in
/etc/sysconfig/logitech_mouse</description>
