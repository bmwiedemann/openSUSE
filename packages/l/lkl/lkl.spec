%description
LKL (Linux Kernel Library) is aiming to allow reusing the Linux kernel code as
extensively as possible with minimal effort and reduced maintenance overhead.

Examples of how LKL can be used are: creating userspace applications (running on
Linux and other operating systems) that can read or write Linux filesystems or
can use the Linux networking stack, creating kernel drivers for other operating
systems that can read Linux filesystems, bootloaders support for reading/writing
Linux filesystems, etc.

With LKL, the kernel code is compiled into an object file that can be directly
linked by applications. The API offered by LKL is based on the Linux system call
interface.

WARNING: LKL is EXPERIMENTAL; using it could cause data corruption!

%package -n lklfuse
Summary:	EXPERIMENTAL: Access storage via an unprivileged user process
Requires:	shadow
BuildRequires:	shadow
Provides:	group(lklfuse)
Provides:	user(lklfuse)

%description -n lklfuse
WARNING: lklfuse is EXPERIMENTAL; using it could cause data corruption!

lklfuse builds upon the Linux Kernel Library (LKL) to reuse kernel filesystem
drivers as part of an unprivileged user-space application.

A udev rule and corresponding systemd user service are provided to
automatically mount connected USB block devices.
