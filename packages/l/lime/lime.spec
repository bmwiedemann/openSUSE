%description
LIME is an encryption library for one-to-one and group instant
messaging, allowing users to exchange messages privately and
asynchronously. It supports multiple devices per user and multiple
users per device.

LIME offers two major security benefits to instant messaging users:
  * End-to-end encryption, which means that only you and your
    contact (and not even the server) can decrypt the content that
    you shared.
  * Perfect forward secrecy, which ensures that encrypted messages
    cannot be decrypted by a third party, even if a key is
    compromised in the future.
