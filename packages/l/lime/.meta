  <title>Instant Message End-to-End Encryption Library</title>
  <description>LIME is an encryption library for one-to-one and group instant messaging, allowing users to exchange messages privately and asynchronously. It supports multiple devices per user and multiple users per device.

LIME offers two major security benefits to instant messaging users:
  * End-to-end encryption, which means that only you and your contact (and not even the server) can decrypt the content that you shared.
  * Perfect forward secrecy, which ensures that encrypted messages cannot be decrypted by a third party, even if a key is compromised in the future.</description>
