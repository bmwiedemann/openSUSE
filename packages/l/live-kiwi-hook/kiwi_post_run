# This script saves two purposes:

# When a new snapshot gets released, a setrelease request is sent to OBS.
# It does $nbin =~ s/-([^-]+)(-Media(?:\d?)(?:\..*?)?)$/$setrelease$2/;
# which basically replaces -Media* with the Snapshot number.
# The isos written by KIWI (and subsequently renamed by the OBS KIWI
# build recipe) do not follow that name scheme, so we need to rename
# it manually to the expected names.
# Additionally, kiwi in a newer version uses "ix86" instead of the full
# arch, which is not handled/expected by various scripts. So undo that.

# The Rescue CD is intented to be written to CDs, so it must not exceed
# the 680 MiB size limit. For GNOME and KDE Lives there's an arbitrary
# 1 GiB limit for USB drives. If the maximum size is exceeded, this script
# exits with 1 and thus aborts the build.
