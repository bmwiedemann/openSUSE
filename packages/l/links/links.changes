- links 2.20.1:
  * libevent bug fixes
- includes changes from 2.20:
  * Security bug fixed: when links was connected to tor, it would
    send real dns requests outside the tor network when the
    displayed page contains link elements with rel=dns-prefetch
    boo#1149886
  * stability improvements
  * file urls support local hostnames
  * mouse support improvement

  * Use proper cookie expiry

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 05 00:59:34 UTC 2019 - seanlew@opensuse.org

- links 2.19
  * Fixed a crash on invalidn IDN URLs
  * Make font selection possible via fontconfig
  * Show certificate authority in Document info box
  * Use international error messages
  * The -dump switch didn't report errors on stdout write

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 18 06:34:48 UTC 2019 - seanlew@opensuse.org

- links 2.18
  * Automatically enable tor mode when the socks port is 9050
  * When in tor mode, invert colors on top line and bottom line
  * Fix an incorrect shift in write_ev_queue 
  * Fix runtime error sanitizer warning
  * Add a menu entry to save and load a clipboard
  * Don't synch with Xserver on every pixmap load

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 22 04:57:03 UTC 2018 - sean@suspend.net

- links 2.17
  * Fix vrifying SSL certificates for numeric IPv6 addresses
  * Delete the option -ftp.fast - it doesn't always work and ftp performance is not an issue anymore
  * Add bold and monospaced Turkish letter 'i' without a dot
  * On OS/2 allocate OpenSSL memory fro the lower heap. It fixes SSL on systems with old 16-bit TCP/IP stack
  * Fix IPv6 on OpenVMS Alpha
  * Support mouse scroll wheel in textarea
  * Delete the option -http-bugs.bug-302-redirect - RFC7231 allows the "buggy" behavior and defines new codes 307 and 308 that retain the post data
  * X11 - fixed colormap leak when creating a new window
  * Fixed an infinite loop that happened in graphics mode if the user clicked on OK in "Miscellaneous options" dialog and more than one windows were open. This bug was introduced in Links 2.15
  * Support 6x6x6 RGB palette in 256-bit color mode on framebuffer
  * Implement dithering properly on OS/2 in 15-bit and 16-bit color mode. In 8-bit mode, Links may optionally use a private palette - it improves visual quality of Links images, but degrades visual quality of other concurrently running programs.
  * Improve scrolling smoothness when the user drags the whole document
  * On OS/2, allocate large memory blocks directly (not with malloc). It reduces memory waste
  * Fixed a bug that setting terminal title and resizing a terminal didn't work on OS/2 and Windows. The bug was introduced in Links 2.16 when shutting up coverity warnings
  * Set link color to yellow by default
  * Delete the option -http-bugs.bug-post-no-keepalive. It was needed in 1999 to avoid some bug in some http server and it is not needed anymore
  * Trust Content-Length on HTTP/1.0 redirect requests. This fixes hangs with misbehaving servers that honor Connection:keep-alive but send out HTTP/1.0 reply without Connection: keep-alive. Links thought that they don't support keep-alive and waited for the connection to close (for example http://www.raspberrypi.org)
  * Use keys 'H' and 'L' to select the top and bottom link on the current page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Jun 30 16:05:23 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- links 2.16:

  * Implement the bracketed paste mode
  * Fix various bugs found by coverity
  * Fix a crash in proxy authentication code
  * Fixed internal error "invalid set_handlers call" on framebuffer
    if links is suspend and terminate at the same time

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Mar 24 19:38:59 UTC 2018 - astieger@suse.com

- links 2.15:
  * Rewrite google docs URLs to the download link, so that the file
    can be viewed in external viewer
  * Add the list of domains for which proxy is not used
  * Temporarily replace the stderr handle with /dev/null when
    decoding png or svg images because the libraries may write to
    stderr
  * Fix improper restarts of connection when http compression is 
    used
  * Free cache when using the -source flag, so that memory
    consumption is not dependent on downloaded file size
  * Do not download compressed files. When the server returns
    compressed file and we are downloading, restart the connection
    without compression.
  * Allow browsing files containing characters < 32 in the filename
  * Limit the number of OpenMP threads to 8
  * Fix premature call to OPENSSL_cleanup while some SSL objects
    could still exist
  * Enable -ftree-vectorize and -ffast-math for GCC, so that it uses
    vector instructions. It improves performance of image scaler.
  * Support international domain names
  * Fix reordering of blocked URLs each time options were saved and
    loaded
  * Fix reading one byte beyond allocated space in case of corrupted
    UTF-8 data - CVE-2017-11114 bsc#1051448
  * Support the brotli compression algorithm using libbrotli
  * Support lzip compression
  * Add a new main menu item 'Windows' for switching windows on
    framebuffer
  * Fix an internal error if the gpm server is terminated while
    links is running on a framebuffer
  * Use fsync() when writing the bookmarks or settings
  * Clear host entry in DNS cache when connection failed
  * Use built-in SSL certificates
  * Encode strings to UTF-8 when storing them in a history, it fixes
    a bug when browsing the history if Links is run on multiple
    terminals with different character sets
  * Use absolute time when calculating the time to flush DNS cache, 
    HTTPS session cache and keepalive connection cache, so that the
    cache gets flushed when the machine is kept suspended for a
    long time.
  * Report IP addresses in the "Document info" box.
  * Implement a small connection timeout when connecting to a host
    with multiple addresses, so that there is faster fallback from
    IPv6 to IPv4.
  * Replace OpenSSL malloc functions with CRYPTO_set_mem_functions,
    so that when malloc returns NULL, we can free some cached data
    and retry
  * Removed special handling of ".onion" addresses
  * Avoid memcpy with NULL source argument and zero length
  * Make the "dns-prefetch" link prefetch just dns, not the whole
    document
  * Use OpenSSL functions X509_check_host and X509_check_ip if
    available
  * Report status when formatting document or searching
  * Use session cache on https

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed bugs when downgrading SSL connection while https proxy or
    socks proxy is used
  * Security bug fixed: Don't load or render the content of
    "407 Proxy Authentication Required" reply when using https
    proxy. This avoids the FalseCONNECT attack. bsc#1022468
    Also, don't allow 401 and 407 responses to set cookies.
  * Pop openssl error stack on every error - make sure that SSL
    errors on one connection do not affect other connections
  * Never select directfb driver automatically unless started with
    the '-driver directfb' option
- previously patched:
  * Disable SSL compression to avoid the CRIME attack bsc#1022469
    drop links-nosslcomp.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Version bump to 2.9:
  * Work around some screen-corruption bugs in the OpenVMS terminal driver
  * Support mouse wheel in framebuffer (unfortunatelly we can't support it
    in text mode because when we instruct gpm to send us the wheel event,
     gpm stops drawing the cursor when the mouse is moved).
  * Pring "^" and "_" for <sub> and <sup> tags in text mode
  * An option to fake Firefox in the HTTP header. It modifies User-Agent and
    several other options to be more Firefox-like. This option is also
    automatically turned on when "Connect only via proxies or Socks (useful
    for tor)" is selected. It makes it safer to use Links with tor.
  * Fixed quadratic complexity in the text renderer when exteremely long
    lines were used
  * Do not print the character 0x9b if the display character set doesn't
    have it, because it is interpreted as a control character on the Linux
    console
  * An option to break long lines in <pre> sections
  * Consume less memory when 8-bit gamma correction is used
  * Updated the list of top level domains
  * Use malloc_trim to return unused memory to the system

  * Fix palette corruption on framebuffer when links instance was terminated
    while it was not active
  * Improve the gif decoder to accept more images
  * Increase the amount of data read from the socket, it improves speed when
    loading big images
  * Accept "text/xml" as html type

  * Use a blocking pipe when communicating with the dns process, it
    fixes a possible error when system pipe buffer is too small
  * data: url
  * Accept color in #xxx format (besides usual #xxxxxx)
  * Fixed an infinite retry loop when the server terminates
    connection prematurely

 is tested properly

- expand inks-nosslcomp.patch to fix other misuses of the openssl
  API including TLSv1 being disabled (with the wrong API too)

- build with SSL_NO_INTERN so we can escape ABI breaks in future 
  openSSL versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 11 00:24:37 UTC 2013 - crrodriguez@opensuse.org

- links was used to demonstrate bnc#803004 
   "openSSL 1.0.1d breaks most, if not all, SSL connections" 
It also turns out that links is not doing SSL stuff quite right..
HTTPS clients must not negotiate SSL compression which is compromised
since CVE-2012-4929 (aka. the CRIME attack) and should not even
try to use SSLv2 either which is broken since a very long time
(links-nosslcomp.patch)
