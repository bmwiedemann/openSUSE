    files in sorted order (bug #1659)
  * Ensure absolute path for include (bug #2075)

    ~/.config/ledger/ledgerrc first
  * Improve Python 3 support and drop support for Python 2
  * Add support for automatically reading files encrypted with GPG
    (bug #1949)
  * Add support for a "debit" column in the convert command
    (bug #1120)
  * Fix parsing of files without end of line (bug #516)

    spaces (bug #2001)
  * Fix payee metadata on postings not being validated and payee
    aliases not being honored (bug #556 & bug #1892)

    posting, which leads to it auto-balancing the posting
    (bug #1942)

  * Fix a regression where empty commodities were shown (bug #1969)
  * Fix a regression where using multiple commodities in one
    transaction triggers an assertion (bug #1998)
  * Fix --time-colon for negative time amounts
  * Use correct int return type for stream input operations
    (bug #2058)
  * Use amount_width for balance report
  * Remove some UTF-8 code that was having no effect (bug #2061)

    include cannot find the file it reports the error with full
    path now. (bug #2057 & bug #2092)
  * Rename quoted_rfc4180 to quoted_rfc, as numbers used in
    function names confuses the parser (#2007).

    names.

  the package gets build only from SLE-12 and beyond anyway
- do not use macros in the URL, as OBS is not expending these for 
  the WebUI
