Mon Sep  9 15:48:56 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.26:
   * Decimal numbers can now be written directly in music, without a
     hash sign.  Together with the previous change in the way object
     properties are specified, the code to change the length of stems
     has changed from this:
          \override Stem #'length = #5.6
          e' f' g' a'
     to this:
          \override Stem.length = 5.6
          e' f' g' a'

     One has to write a digit on both sides of the dot - values like
     `4.' or `-.3' are not allowed.

     Decimal fractions are also not accepted in `\chordmode'.

   * A number of shorthands like `(', `)', `|', `[', `]', `~', `\(',
     `\)' and others can now freely be redefined like normal commands.
     An example would be

          "\\{" = (
          "\\}" = )
          "(" = \melisma
          ")" = \melismaEnd

          \new Staff <<
            \relative c' {
              c8 \{ d e f \} % slurred
              g ( a b c ) % no slur, but with melisma
              c,1 \bar "|."
             }
             \addlyrics { Li -- ly -- pond. }
          >>
           [image of music]
   * The articulation shorthand for `\staccatissimo' has been renamed
     from `-|' to `-!'.

   * Tempo change ranges are now written as `\tempo 4 = 60 - 68' rather
     than `\tempo 4 = 60 ~ 68'.
- make-doc-crash.patch upstreamed

Tue Aug 13 07:52:45 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 27 12:36:28 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.14:
   * The meaning of `instrumentTransposition' has been reversed.  After
          \set instrumentTransposition = #{ b #}
     a written `c'' now sounds like `b'.  Previously, this would have
     been the other way round.  This and the following change should
     make dealing with transposing instruments more straightforward.

   * The music generated by `\set' and `\override' commands is no
     longer affected by `\transpose'.  The main consequence is that
     `\transpose' will transpose audible/concert pitch and printed
     pitch by the same amount even when the transposed music contains
     `\transposition'.  Previously,
          \transpose c' f' \transposition bes'
     was equivalent to `\transposition f''.  Now it stays equivalent to
     `\transposition bes''.

   * Tuplets are now created with the `\tuplet' command, which takes a
     fraction `T/N' to specify that T notes are played in the time
     usually allowed for N. One `\tuplet' command can create several
     tuplet groups if their duration is typed after the fraction.

          \tuplet 3/2 { c8 d e } \tuplet 3/2 { f e d } c2
          \tuplet 3/2 4 { c8 d e f e d } c2
           [image of music]


     The `\times' command with its inverted fraction order `N/T' is
     still available.
   etc. see NEWS.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 31 14:29:37 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to version 2.17.9:
  * The `\clef' command supports optional octavation:

          \clef "treble_(8)"
          c2 c
          \clef "bass^[15]"
          c2 c
   * The LilyPond syntax of dot-separated words `Voice.Accidental' has
     been made interchangeable with `#'(Voice Accidental)', a Scheme
     list of symbols.  As one result, code like
     \override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
     is now equivalent to
     \override Voice.TextSpanner bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     or even
     \override #'(Voice TextSpanner) bound-details.left.text = "rit."
  * Grob and grob property path no longer need to be specified as two
     separate arguments to commands like `\override' and `\revert',
     allowing for the syntax
     \override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     Since complementary music functions like `\overrideProperty'
     cannot support forms with and without separating space at the same
     time, using a single dotted path is now the preferred form.
     Specifying grob path and grob property path separately, currently
     still supported with `\override' and `\revert' for compatibility
     reasons, is deprecated.
   * Due to words now being accepted as symbol function arguments, the
     interfaces of `\accidentalStyle', `\alterBroken', `\footnote' and
     `\tweak' had to be redesigned where optional symbol arguments were
     involved.  Please check the respective music function
     documentation for details.
   * Several commands now accept symbol lists (conveniently entered as
     dot-separated words) for various kinds of arguments.  These
     include `\accidentalStyle', `\alterBroken', `\footnote', `\hide',
     `\omit', `\overrideProperty', `\shape', and `\tweak'.
   * The bar line user interface has changed. Bar glyphs now resemble
     the appearance of the bar line, so a left repeat sign has to be
     coded as `.|:'. The command `\defineBarLine' provides an easy way
     to define additional bar line styles.
   * Accidentals in the key signature may be printed in octaves other
     than their traditional positions, or in multiple octaves.
