  * beta phase to 2.18
  * bugfixes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  9 15:46:59 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.26:
   * Decimal numbers can now be written directly in music, without a
     hash sign.  Together with the previous change in the way object
     properties are specified, the code to change the length of stems
     has changed from this:
          \override Stem #'length = #5.6
          e' f' g' a'
     to this:
          \override Stem.length = 5.6
          e' f' g' a'

     One has to write a digit on both sides of the dot - values like
     `4.' or `-.3' are not allowed.

     Decimal fractions are also not accepted in `\chordmode'.

   * A number of shorthands like `(', `)', `|', `[', `]', `~', `\(',
     `\)' and others can now freely be redefined like normal commands.
     An example would be

          "\\{" = (
          "\\}" = )
          "(" = \melisma
          ")" = \melismaEnd

          \new Staff <<
            \relative c' {
              c8 \{ d e f \} % slurred
              g ( a b c ) % no slur, but with melisma
              c,1 \bar "|."
             }
             \addlyrics { Li -- ly -- pond. }
          >>
           [image of music]
   * The articulation shorthand for `\staccatissimo' has been renamed
     from `-|' to `-!'.

   * Tempo change ranges are now written as `\tempo 4 = 60 - 68' rather
     than `\tempo 4 = 60 ~ 68'.
- make-doc-crash.patch upstreamed

Tue Aug 13 07:52:45 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

  + lilypond-make-doc-crash.patch

  * bugfixes
- removed python26.patch and gcc44-relocate.patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 12 09:22:56 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.20:
   * Grob `OctavateEight' was renamed to `ClefModifier'.  Related
     context properties were renamed from `xxxOctavationyyy' to
     `xxxTranspositionyyy'.
   * There is a new `\absolute' command explicitly marking music as
     being entered in absolute pitch.  While this has been the default
     previously, an explicit `\absolute' also prevents reinterpretation
     when the passage is placed inside of `\relative':

          \relative c { c'4 \absolute { f'' g'' } c }
           [image of music]
   * When `\relative' is used without an explicit reference pitch, the
     reference pitch now is the middle of the first octave, making the
     first entered pitch indistinguishable from absolute pitch.
     Previously, omitting the reference pitch would have lead to a
     default of `c''.  Since that choice was somewhat arbitrary,
     recommended usage was to always specify the reference pitch.
   * A new command `\single' can be used for converting a property
     override into a tweak to be applied on a single music expression:

          <a \single\voiceTwoStyle e' a>1
           [image of music]
   * Two ways of letting graphical objects not appear in the output are
     overriding its `transparent' property with `#t' (retaining the
     original spacing) or overriding its `stencil' property with `#f'
     (not using any space at all).  Those two operations now have the
     shorthands `\hide' and `\omit', respectively.  They can either be
     given a music expression to tweak, or the name of a graphical
     object for which an override should be created (for specifying
     both, use `\single' on the override form):

          \new Staff \with { \omit Clef }
          \relative c'' <a e' \hide a>1
           [image of music]
   * A new command `\temporary' can be applied to overrides in order to
     not have them replace previous property settings.  If a `\revert'
     is applied to the same property subsequently, the previous setting
     reappears:
          \override NoteHead.color = #red c4
          \override NoteHead.color = #green d
          \revert NoteHead.color e2
          \override NoteHead.color = #red c4
          \temporary\override NoteHead.color = #green d
          \revert NoteHead.color e
          \revert NoteHead.color c
           [image of music]
     This is mainly useful for writing music functions that need to
     have some property changed just for the duration of the function.
   * `\tag', `\removeWithTag', and `\keepWithTag' can now accept a list
     of symbols rather than just a single symbol for marking, removing,
     and keeping music with any of multiple tags.  This is particularly
     important for `\keepWithTag' since one cannot achieve the same
     effect by using multiple consecutive `\keepWithTag' commands.
   * The `-d old-relative' option has been removed.  Not actually
     accessible from the command line any more, its remaining use was
     for interpretating `\relative' in LilyPond files converted
     automatically from version 1.8 or older.  It is unclear how much
     of this was actually still operative.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 27 10:51:23 UTC 2013 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.14:
   * The meaning of `instrumentTransposition' has been reversed.  After
          \set instrumentTransposition = #{ b #}
     a written `c'' now sounds like `b'.  Previously, this would have
     been the other way round.  This and the following change should
     make dealing with transposing instruments more straightforward.

   * The music generated by `\set' and `\override' commands is no
     longer affected by `\transpose'.  The main consequence is that
     `\transpose' will transpose audible/concert pitch and printed
     pitch by the same amount even when the transposed music contains
     `\transposition'.  Previously,
          \transpose c' f' \transposition bes'
     was equivalent to `\transposition f''.  Now it stays equivalent to
     `\transposition bes''.

   * Tuplets are now created with the `\tuplet' command, which takes a
     fraction `T/N' to specify that T notes are played in the time
     usually allowed for N. One `\tuplet' command can create several
     tuplet groups if their duration is typed after the fraction.

          \tuplet 3/2 { c8 d e } \tuplet 3/2 { f e d } c2
          \tuplet 3/2 4 { c8 d e f e d } c2
           [image of music]


     The `\times' command with its inverted fraction order `N/T' is
     still available.
   etc. see NEWS.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 31 14:25:31 UTC 2012 - pgajdos@suse.com

- updated to 2.17.9:
  * The `\clef' command supports optional octavation:

          \clef "treble_(8)"
          c2 c
          \clef "bass^[15]"
          c2 c
   * The LilyPond syntax of dot-separated words `Voice.Accidental' has
     been made interchangeable with `#'(Voice Accidental)', a Scheme
     list of symbols.  As one result, code like
     \override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
     is now equivalent to
     \override Voice.TextSpanner bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     or even
     \override #'(Voice TextSpanner) bound-details.left.text = "rit."
  * Grob and grob property path no longer need to be specified as two
     separate arguments to commands like `\override' and `\revert',
     allowing for the syntax
     \override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     Since complementary music functions like `\overrideProperty'
     cannot support forms with and without separating space at the same
     time, using a single dotted path is now the preferred form.
     Specifying grob path and grob property path separately, currently
     still supported with `\override' and `\revert' for compatibility
     reasons, is deprecated.
   * Due to words now being accepted as symbol function arguments, the
     interfaces of `\accidentalStyle', `\alterBroken', `\footnote' and
     `\tweak' had to be redesigned where optional symbol arguments were
     involved.  Please check the respective music function
     documentation for details.
   * Several commands now accept symbol lists (conveniently entered as
     dot-separated words) for various kinds of arguments.  These
     include `\accidentalStyle', `\alterBroken', `\footnote', `\hide',
     `\omit', `\overrideProperty', `\shape', and `\tweak'.
   * The bar line user interface has changed. Bar glyphs now resemble
     the appearance of the bar line, so a left repeat sign has to be
     coded as `.|:'. The command `\defineBarLine' provides an easy way
     to define additional bar line styles.
   * Accidentals in the key signature may be printed in octaves other
     than their traditional positions, or in multiple octaves.

            \bar "kievan"
          }
           [image of music]


   * Augmentation dots now avoid the other voice in two-voice polyphony
     so that users can move the `Dot_column_engraver' to set dots
     independently for each `Voice'.

          [image of music]


   * A Scheme function to adjust the control points of curves such as
     slurs and ties, developed by several users, is now included in
     LilyPond.

          g8->( bes,-.) d4
          \shape Slur #'((-0.5 . 1.5) (-3 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . 0))

Fri Dec 10 22:44:00 UTC 2010 - davejplater@gmail.com

- Fixed factory documentation build problem due to
  texlive-bin-2010-34.2 bibtex change in behaviour with patch from
  lilypond git - lilypond-bib2html.patch.
- The patch fixes the following issues :
  With the latest update of TeX Live 2009, bibtex became a "safe"
  command in that it cannot write output to any directory other than
  (a) a subdirectory of the current directory
  (b) a subdirectory of TEXMFOUTPUT
  Setting TEXMFOUTPUT to the temporary directory permits bibtex to
  write in that directory.
  Additionally, use mkstemp() instead mktemp(), since the latter
  function has been deprecated since Python 2.3.

Thu Aug 16 13:19:57 CEST 2007 - pcerny@suse.cz

- update to 2.10.29 (new stable branch, see NEWS.txt for details)
     * `lilypond-book' supports DocBook too.
   * Balloon texts can be entered more ergonomically, and are no longer
     clipped from the output.
   * Slurs now avoid clefs and key changes.
   * The `FretBoards' context will generate guitar frettings
     automatically,
   * Horizontal and vertical spacing are now done at the same time so
     that pages are filled more evenly.
   * The page breaking algorithm is capable of detecting page turns and
     formatting the music accordingly.
   * Guitar right hand fingerings may now also be added,
   * By defining a clip region, a cutout EPS file of a number of
     measures may be generated from the complete score.  Hence, it is
     no longer necessary to create separate files to create extracts of
     (long) scores.  An example is shown in
     `input/regression/clip-systems.ly'.
   * Lyric texts may include tie symbols by using the `~' symbol,
   * Calculation of note head durations is now softcoded.
   * Chords can now be partially tied,
   * Lyric extenders now have tunable padding.
   * Instrument changes are better supported: names in the margin can be
     changed half-way during a staff, and cues are printed
     automatically.
   * Barlines can be dashed now,
   * Grace notes may be forced to use floating spacing,
   * Durations of grace notes are taken into account for spacing,
   * Tuplet brackets can be made to run to prefatory matter or the next
     note
   * Falls and doits can be added to notes
   * `lilypond-book' now includes support for PDFTeX.
   * Nested tuplets can have different formatting for each nesting
     level,
   * New sections with different spacing parameters can be started with
     `newSpacingSection'.  This is useful when there are sections with
     a different notions of long and short notes.
   * A new, automated testing technique has been added. It will detect
     changes in the formatting automatically, which will make it easier
     to spot regression errors in the future.
   * Figured bass can also be added to `Staff' contexts directly. In
     this case, their vertical position is adjusted automatically.
   * Beams may be put on isolated stems, and beamlets may be paired by
     setting the `max-beam-connect' property,
   * Beaming patterns obey the `beatGrouping' property.
   * With the command `\transposedCueDuring' a cue's transposition can
     be changed locally.  This can be used to prevent excessive ledger
     lines on cues.
   * By setting `hairpinToBarline', hairpins will stop at the barline
     preceding the ending note.
   * Objects may be rotated using the `rotation' property.  [image of music]
   * Hairpins now support circled tips (al niente notation).  [image of music]
   * The MusicXML convertor has been sped up, and has rudimentary
     support for percussion notation.  It will also condense multi-bar
     rests to enable part extraction.
   * The beam printing code has been completely rewritten, and now
     includes support for feathered beaming,
     Known bug: the \featherDuration command only works with very short
     music snippets.
   * The `\note' markup command now also accepts note head styles.
   * Tie chord formatting also works with arpegiated ties.
