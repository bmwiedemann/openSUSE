Sat Oct  7 16:25:40 UTC 2023 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.17.0
  - Caps Lock is no longer treated as a modifier key in keybindings. Use
    --capslock to enable it.
  - New features:
    - The Bookmarks menu lists all of your bookmarks and folders.
    - Snippets: A collection of short text segments that can be pasted into any
      input field via the context menu. For example, useful for your gemlog
      header/footer and other often-repeated parts.
    - Snippets can be managed in Preferences > Snippets and created by
      right-clicking on links or selected text on a page.
    - Custom search queries: Snippets whose name starts with a bang (e.g., "!w")
      can be invoked in the URL field to make customized queries. The snippet
      content should be a Gemini search URL, for example:
      "gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/search".
    - Quick lookup shows matching snippets as a new type of search result.
    - Keyboard shortcut Shift+1/⇧1 for conveniently making a snippet query.
    - Input prompts, upload dialogs, and bookmark editors can be resized by
      dragging the left or right edge.
    - Text zooming in the upload text editor.
    - Gemtext syntax highlighting in the upload dialog.
    - Recently submitted input prompt contents are saved persistently and can be
      restored via the Ellipsis utility menu in the prompt dialog.
    - You can force the input prompt to appear before a certain URL is requested
      so you can enter a query string. This is useful for avoiding an extra
      request when it is known that a URL will require input (e.g., search
      engine, game input).
    - When importing links as bookmarks, you can optionally create subfolders
      from headings. You can also choose a destination folder for the imported
      bookmarks.
    - Quickly add/move a bookmark into a folder with the navbar bookmark button
      context menu.
    - User-selectable feed refresh interval. Previously the interval been
      hardcoded to four hours. (Based on a patch by Michael Nordmeyer.)
    - Setting to never/always collapse preformatted blocks, disabling the
      ability to toggle the folding.
    - "Fold All" and "Unfold All" in Bookmarks sidebar context menu.
    - "Search" context menu item on selected text to make a search query with
      it.
    - "Use as Search URL" in link context menu.
    - "Mark All Links as Visited" in the Tools submenu.
    - Option --capslock: enable Caps Lock as a modifier in keybindings.
    - Option --theme (-t): change UI color theme of open Lagrange windows. Can
      be used in scripts to switch the theme automatically (for example, see the
      darkman utility; thanks to Jason McBrayer for suggesting this).
    - Support for the Nex protocol
      (nex://nightfall.city/nex/info/specification.txt).
    - Keyboard shortcut for deleting bookmarks (Backspace). Useful when the
      Bookmarks list has input focus.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Menus can have submenus. Several of the old menus were reorganized
      accordingly. For example, the page context menu has a Tools submenu for
      translation, Titan uploads, etc.
    - Show unsupported media types as plain text if the content is valid UTF-8
      encoded text.
    - The page scrolls while selecting text near top/bottom.
    - Display a logo graphic in empty windows/tabs as a placeholder.
    - Visualize input focus in lists by drawing a focus rectangle around the
      current item.
    - Menu separators are taller and more distinct for a clearer item
      separation.
    - Adjusted colors of the Import Identity dialog.
    - Auto-hide sidebars when resizing a window/split if the document area would
      become narrower than the sidebar.
    - Tuned theme color palette and improved background colors of "Colorful
      Light".
    - Newly created client certificates have a default expiration date in the
      year 9999, which means they won't expire. One can still also set a specific
      date as before.
    - Periodically save UI state (including each tab's navigation history) to
      prevent data loss in case the app crashes. These runtime saves do not
      include any cached page content. The full cache is still saved as before
      when quitting the app.
  - Fixes:
    - Potential crash at shutdown when a feed update is ongoing.
    - Problems with window refresh when multiple windows are open. For example,
      the cursor not blinking in input fields.
    - Incorrect name displayed in page banner when URL query string contains a
      tilde name.
    - Fixed navbar spinner animation going too fast when both sides of a split
      view are being loaded.
    - Glitches during swipe navigation (touch screens, macOS trackpad). Behavior
      is more robust at ends of history and when content is not immediately
      available in cache.
    - Fixed opening of context menus via keyboard (incorrect click position).
    - Fixed a text rendering issue where glyphs were incorrect when preceded by
      a Narrow No-Break Space.

  - Context/button menus use a popup window if they would otherwise have to

    before switching back to the origin tab.
  - Center a short title under the icon in the page margin.

    - Preferences: Option for silently following scheme-changing redirects
      (Network tab; default: no).

      left-to-right order.
    - Preferences: Moved cache/memory size settings to Content tab.
    - Page title in margin omits prefix Emoji if it matches the bookmark icon.
    - Adjusted word-wrapping to break at a period inside a word (e.g., domain

      in history.
    - Fixed potential crash when closing split view during a scrolling animation

  - Fixed hang when setting a folder's parent to itself in the Edit Folder
    dialog.

- update to 1.14.0
  - New features:
    - A bookmark folder can be opened in new tabs, in the same window or a new
      one, one tab per bookmark.
    - Pinned bookmark identities. A simpler way to use identities. When the
      "Pinned identity" property is set on a bookmark, opening the bookmark
      causes the selected identity to be "pinned" to the tab: while you stay on
      the same site, the identity remains in use when opening links. However,
      when opening a link to another site, a new tab gets opened. (The old way
      of per-URL identities is still available, too.)
    - New identities can be created for use in the current directory (as opposed
      to domain or page).
    - Option --dump (-d) to print contents of URLs/paths to stdout. Metadata is
      printed to stderr.
    - Option --dump-identity (-I) selects the identity to use with --dump.
    - Option --replace-tab URL opens a URL, replacing contents of the active
      tab.
    - Option --user DIR (-U) to set the directory where user data is stored.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - When creating new identities, make it clearer what the scope of usage will
      be. The UI actions explicitly say "New Identity for Domain" when the
      default usage will be the entire domain.
    - URLs opened via system-level handlers always open a new tab, like URLs
      opened via the command line.
    - MIME types of many new file extensions are recognized (courtesy of John
      Cowan).
    - The regular expression library PCRE2 is preferred over PCRE, if available.
      The older library is in maintenance mode.
    - Updated UI translations.
  - Fixes:
    - Accidental backwards navigation when quickly refreshing the page twice.
    - Page scroll position is kept when loading finishes, if the user already
      scrolled during loading.
    - Schemeless relative URLs no longer assume "gemini" as the scheme, instead
      using the current page's scheme as default.
    - Opening a feed entry in a background tab will mark is as read, like
      opening in the foreground does.
    - ANSI escapes 39 and 49 (reset FG/BG color to default) were not working.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Nov  6 11:43:23 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

  - Fixed crash when switching view to plain text.

    side. The other side would not receive wheel events unless input focus was
    first switched over.
  - Fixed issues with popup menu positioning.
  - Fixed drawing of the widget scroll indicator when a widget doesn't fit
    vertically in the window.
  - Possible workaround for an issue with mouse hover autoscrolling on an
    external displays.
  - Don't open an endless number of bookmark creation/edit dialogs when holding
    down the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+D/⌘D).
  - Percent-encode backslashes in externally opened URLs, for improved
    compatibility.
  - Custom link icons are allowed with unsupported/unrecognized protocols (i.e.,
    Emoji at the start of link label).
  - Use file name as the tab/window title if the content has no headings.
  - Avoid redundancy in tab/window titles ("Cosmos — Cosmos" → "Cosmos").
  - Updated UI translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May 20 15:47:30 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.13.5
  - Parent navigation assumes directory URL is equivalent to index page URL
    (e.g., "/path/" == "/path/index.gmi"): this now only applies to Gemini URLs,
    and checks for "index.gemini", too, as per Gemini Best Practices.
  - Fixed crash when determining the name of a ZIP file from a URL.
  - Fixed misparsing of URL to form the name of a downloaded file (%23 decoded
    too early).

  - TUI: Tuned build flags in build-tui.sh as a Linux workaround (set -O1 on
    SEALCurses).
  - TUI: Ignore the LAGRANGE_OVERRIDE_DPI environment variable.
  - Spartan: Fixed opening URLs in other apps via operating system handlers.

Tue May  3 16:35:05 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.13.0
  - New features:
    - Curses-based clagrange for running the app in the terminal. This is a
      complete TUI port of the original GUI version including, e.g., UI
      animations, smooth scrolling, and split view mode. clagrange has separate
      preferences, UI state, and key bindings but the rest of the runtime files
      are shared with the GUI version.
    - Build option ENABLE_TUI: build a text mode version of the app so it can be
      run in the terminal. Enabling this produces an executable called clagrange
      that is not linked with SDL.
    - URL field indicator that shows if there's a bookmark for the current page.
      Clicking on the indicator opens the Add/Edit Bookmark dialog.
    - Checking server certificates using a bundled root CA file.
    - Build option CACERT_PEM_PATH: path of a cacert.pem file that contains
      trusted root CA certificates. This file is included in resources.lgr.
    - Support for the Spartan protocol. Prompt lines will open an input dialog
      for submitting text. This can be expanded to the full upload dialog using
      which a file can be uploaded, too.
    - Reopening the last closed tab. The default binding is Shift+Ctrl+T.
    - Page context menu item "View as Plain Text": show the page source as plain
      text.
    - Option to view Markdown as source or as a Gemtext conversion (default: as
      source).
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Updated Noto Emoji font with support for Unicode 14. There should be no
      more missing Emoji glyphs.
    - Improved UI keyboard navigation. The sidebar and all widgets in dialogs

      opening menus. Menu items and lists are cursor-navigable. Opening the
      sidebar automatically gives it keyboard focus.

      a bookmark for the URL. The Edit Bookmark dialog has a new Duplicate
      button for actually making a duplicate bookmark.
    - Markdown documents support horizontal rules.
    - TUI: Zoom controls resize the open sidebar (left sidebar if both visible).
  - Fixes:
    - Sidebar page outline not updated when the current tab changes.

    - Export and import user data as a ZIP archive, including identities,
      bookmarks, site-specific settings, trusted certificate fingerprints, and

      long.
    - Added new content theme "Oceanic" with support for both dark and light

    - Theme palette tuning: adjusted generated palettes of Colorful Dark/Light,
      improved the Sepia theme, and added a dark mode Sepia variant.

      displays.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Mar 18 22:26:57 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.11.2

  - New features:
    - Multiple windows. Windows can be opened via the menu, Ctrl/⌘+N, or link
      context menus.
    - Restoring tabs at launch is now optional. Added a toggle in Preferences >
      General.
    - Site-specific settings (Shift+Ctrl/⌘+Comma), with options for theme
      customization and showing ANSI escape warnings. The custom theme is based
      on a "seed string" chosen by the user.

      based on all the glyphs they provide, so one can look up which fontpacks
      provide any missing glyphs.
    - "Manage Fonts" button on the Preferences > Fonts tab. It opens
      "about:fonts".

      page. This is limited to JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF (no animations).

    - TLS session caching: reduces the need for redundant handshaking by keeping
      old TLS sessions cached for 10 minutes.
    - UI language for Italian.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - The input prompt dialog saves entered text persistently, just like the
      Upload dialog. This prevents losing text if the dialog is closed
      accidentally.

    - Sidebar context menus have more consistent "open" menu items, now
      including opening the item in a new window.

      points.
    - Downloading the Classic Set fontpack is no longer suggested since
      fontpacks can be searched as needed.
    - Abbreviate font pack descriptions on "about:fonts". The full description

      theme has a bright colorful background to avoid clashing with the UI
      accent color.
    - Adjusted colors of the Gray and Black page themes.
    - Added additional (small) variations to theme hues.
    - Data URLs have their own link icon.
    - Adjusted appearance of context menus.

  - Fixes:
    - Incorrect behavior and UI glitches related to data URLs. The UI will now
      omit the encoded part of data URLs.
    - Occasional mismatch between page and banner backgrounds. It was due to
      loss of precision when converting colors to 8-bit RGB.
    - Issues with changing UI metrics when a window moves between displays. Not
      all UI elements were rescaled properly.
    - Glitches with opening and closing context menus.

  - The "Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows" Unicode block (U+2B00...U+2BFF) is

    lay out the Emoji as double-wide characters to avoid overlapping.
  - Faster hover-scrolling of long popup menus.
  - Fixed sidebars not getting updated after identity addition/deletion.
  - Fixed "Paste Preceding Line" not being undoable.

    continuously, spiking CPU usage.
  - Fixed link numbers showing up next to image captions.
  - Fixed how the link hover popup handles extremely long URLs.
  - Updated UI translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    button.

  - Site icon ❑ replaced with ⌘ ("place of interest") for a more distinct
    appearance and to avoid similarity with the ❐ "Open in New Tab" icon.
  - Navigating to parent or root from "about:" pages goes to "about:about" to
    see overview of all the About pages.
  - Gopher: Fixed navigating to root, e.g., when clicking on the page top
    banner. Set item type to 1 to show a gophermap and not the plain source.
  - Titan: When navigating to parent/root, switch URL scheme to "gemini". This
    action occurs on a Titan response page, so initiating a new upload with the
    parent/root URL is probably not appropriate.
  - Fixed crash when a media player is active and a new download is started.
  - Fixed crash when a line contains nothing but an ANSI escape sequence.
  - Fixed a possible crash when saving state of subscribed feeds.
  - Fixed the right-hand sidebar handling the U and Shift+U key events if it was
    showing the Feeds tab, even though the sidebar was hidden.

    characters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 24 21:26:16 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.10.2

  - Linux: SDL event handling workaround adjusted to only apply to 2.0.18+.
  - Updated UI translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Customizable navbar actions. Right-click on a button to change its action.
      (Identity and hamburger buttons cannot be changed.)
    - Identity toolbar menu can be used to switch between alternate identities.
      If you have used multiple identities on one site, this makes it more
      convenient to switch between them.
    - Added "Edit Page with Titan": opens the upload dialog with current page's
      content prefilled.
    - Added "Paste Preceding Line" in the input prompt dialog. Potential use
      cases include user-editable sections on a page and suggested/example input
      values.

      unsupported.
    - Added option to disable cursor blinking in input fields.

      inlined, regardless of the file extension in the URL.
    - Inline image metadata goes under the image instead of possibly overlapping
      the label text.
    - Inline downloads have a context menu for relevant actions, and clicking on
      the download opens the file.
    - Improved highlighting of open pages. The highlight no longer goes under
      the side elements on the page.
    - Entry dates in feed links are de-emphasized for improved readability.
    - Revised link hover popup. None of the information appears on the same line
      any more (which was problematic if there wasn't enough space). Instead,
      everything is shown in a popup at the bottom/top of the view, including
      the identity that will be used when opening the link and the date of last
      visit.
    - Revised layout of the Upload dialog. There is a new edit field that lets
      you modify the file path of the URL. Identity names are in bold.
    - Optimized UI layout procedure and memory use during UI event processing.
    - Audio subsystem is only initialized when actually needed.

      same URL in history, only the latest one's content would be used when
      navigating back/forward.
    - Fixed handling of reserved characters in URLs (cf. RFC 3986, section 2.2).
    - Fixed the copy/paste context menu not showing in input fields.
    - Fixed duplicated warnings showing in the page banner.
    - Fixed very narrow input fields causing the app to hang.
    - Fixed initial scroll position in multiline input fields.

Mon Nov 29 19:46:09 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.9.1

  - Fixed crash when creating a top-level bookmark.
  - Fixed drawing the page timestamp.
  - Fixed layout of tab buttons and other resizing widgets so all available

    depending on how many tabs are open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      Read", and dropdown menu and keyboard shortcuts for changing the filter
      mode.
    - Feeds tab remembers the unread/all filter mode persistently.
    - ANSI foreground colors are modified to match colored theme backgrounds
      (e.g., Sepia).
    - Navigating back and forward in history will skip input query prompts
      (status 1x), showing only the query results.
    - Ctrl+A now selects all text in input fields.
    - The resource bundle (resources.lgr) is now a regular ZIP archive. This
      allows it to do double duty as a fontpack containing the built-in fonts.
      The archive contains a version number to avoid use of obsolete resources.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed layout issues related to footer action buttons. Sometimes the
      buttons would overlap page content.
    - Fixed handling duplicate feed entries: if multiple entries in a feed have
      the same URL, only use the first one.

    peer closed the connection prematurely.
  - Gopher: Recognize both LF and CRLF line endings in page content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 30 19:18:41 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.8.0

    is bundled with the app. If additional fonts are needed, one can use custom

  - New features:
    - Added a customizable font library. Open "about:fonts" to view and manage
      the installed fonts.
    - Added TrueType fonts as a recognized content type. When one is viewed in
      the app (e.g., via a drag-and-drop), there is an option to install it as a
      user font.
    - Added fontpacks: ZIP archives containing one or more TrueType fonts and
      parameters about how they should be used.
    - Added support for TrueType collections (.ttc).
    - Added new font options: separate preformatted and monospace body fonts, UI
      font, smoothing.
    - Added style option to show all links as bold regardless of visited status.
    - Added warning message about missing font glyphs.
    - Added warning message about terminal emulation. Lagrange supports a small
      subset of ANSI escape sequences, so page appearance may be incorrect when
      these are used in content.
    - Added tab close buttons.
    - Added style option to show links as bold regardless of visited status.
    - Added a feed subscription option to exclude web links (HTTP/HTTPS), since

      top banner, and their appearance can no longer be replicated via Gemtext.
    - Warning messages are interactive. Click on them to perform relevant
      actions.
    - Per-pixel scrolling in input fields (e.g., when using a trackpad on
      macOS).
    - "file://" pages are always unthemed.
    - Show a byte counter during large downloads instead of instantly jumping to
      a content view. Content may not viewable correctly until the download has
      finished.
    - Site-specific settings (sitespec.txt) converted to .ini format. These are
      currently used for the Titan upload port and remembering which warnings
      have been dismissed.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where the page is unscrollable until the mouse cursor is
      moved (wrong hover state).
    - Fixed wrapping of long input prompts and dialog messages.

    - Fixed various layout issues with page footer buttons.

    moved to be the last item in the folder, or out of the folder depending on
    which side of the boundary marker the mouse cursor is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 28 19:34:41 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.7.0

      represent folders.

      dependency and will be included in the build if found via pkg-config.
    - Added command line options -w, -h for setting window size at launch.
    - Added new UI languages: Esperanto, Spanish (Mexico), Galician,
      Interslavic, and Slovak. Note that some of these are still works in
      progress.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Bookmarks are now ordered manually. You can drag and drop bookmarks in the
      list to change the order.
    - The internal bookmarks file format is now a TOML subset instead of just
      being three text lines per bookmark, making it more robust and
      human-readable.
    - Context menus and other popup menus that do not fit inside the window are
      split off into independent windows.
    - Dropdown button menus position themselves on the currently selected item.
    - Dialogs that don't fit inside the window have a scroll bar. Note that such
      dialogs can only be scrolled via mouse wheel/trackpad, not by dragging the
      bar.
    - Adjusted mouse wheel smooth scrolling speed for better consistency. The
      default scrolling speeds were increased to level 2.
    - Visited URLs are remembered for six months. This affects the unread status
      of feed entries and the visited status of links.
    - Adjusted the UI color palette so that the alternative accent color is used
      more rarely. For example, input fields now use the primary accent color.
    - Adjusted button hover/press colors for better consistency, particularly
      when the button label uses a non-standard color.
    - Image links (as determined by file extension) automatically use a "photo"
      link icon if the URL is on the current site. This makes it clearer which
      links will likely show up as an inline image.
    - Alt+Shift+Tab inserts a tab character in input fields.
    - UI rendering optimizations. Some UI controls (e.g., navbar, menus) will
      buffer their contents so they can be drawn efficiently during animations.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed issues with subscribed feed entry tracking. Heading entries are not
      discarded until they are removed from the source.
    - Fixed the sidebar unread entry count showing the wrong number after
      subscribing to a Headings feed.
    - Fixed handling of tab characters in the Upload text editor (when using
      HarfBuzz).
    - Fixed hang when wrapping a very long word (with HarfBuzz disabled).
    - Fixed regressions in retaining window state, position, and size.
    - Fixed URL encoding of the % character.
    - Fixed ambiguous handling of colons in URI paths.
    - Fixed issues with cursor positioning in multi-line input fields.
    - Fixed issues with touch swipe events.
    - X11: Ask SDL not to bypass the window compositor. This should avoid issues
      on KDE, for example.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  1 19:32:57 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.5
  - Audio init errors are no longer fatal. SDL's error message will still be
    printed.
  - Fixed appearance of tab buttons (should have no top frame).
  - Fixed a cursor position regression in input fields related to handling of
    variation selectors (codepoint clusters). Moving the cursor to the start of
    a wrapped line segment put the cursor in the wrong place.
  - Fixed right-clicking on sidebar tab buttons. It was showing the wrong
    context menu when the list had been scrolled down.
  - Fixed crash when using the SDL2 KMSDRM video driver.
  - Fixed minor visual artifacts in preformatted blocks and near the bottom of
    the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 22 09:27:19 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.4
  - Local files containing UTF-8 text can be viewed regardless of their file
    extension.
  - Fixed input field cursor positioning and insertion problems around Emoji
    variation selectors.
  - Fixed "Unknown Status Code" shown in Page Information for valid status
    codes.
  - Fixed an issue with network requests that would make it appear the server
    was not responding, but the request would not time out.
  - Fixed a potential invalid memory access when clicking on sidebar items.
  - OpenBSD: Fixed a freeze after a network request is cancelled.
  - Fixed page contents not reflowing during a window resize.
  - Added build option ENABLE_RESIZE_DRAW. SDL doesn't redraw window contents on
    all platforms during resizing, so this can be used to force it.
- Removed patch lagrange-1.6.3-Updated-AppData.patch. Applied upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 15 11:46:07 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- Added patch lagrange-1.6.3-Updated-AppData.patch
  (on git this was released as a version 1.6.3-1)

  - Fixed what gets drawn in an empty tab, before a document is available for
    rendering (e.g., after switching to split view mode).
  - Fixed highlighting the domain name in URL input fields.
  - Fixed hiding the Gemini URL scheme in input fields when the window is
    narrow.
  - Fixed the line break key modifier inadvertently affecting URL input fields,
    where line breaks are not allowed.
  - Fixed the line break key modifier affecting the upload dialog's text field.
  - Fixed a potential hang when closing a socket before the connection is fully
    opened.

    segment.
  - Scroll with mouse wheel in input fields.
  - Slower cursor blink rate in input fields.
  - Adjusted dark mode colors for focused input fields.
  - Fixed incorrect behavior in input fields when typing or deleting text while
    holding down the Shift key.
  - Fixed crash in Upload dialog if server responds with a redirect.
  - Fixed buffered graphics (UI, fonts) getting lost under rare circumstances.
  - Fixed drawing of wrapped text when the app is compiled without HarfBuzz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 30 10:02:45 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.1
  - Fixed potential crash when inserting a line break in an input field.
  - Fixed cursor positioning in fixed-length input fields.
  - Fixed copying text in input fields (the wrong region was copied).
  - Fixed URL input field contents not being selected after opening a new tab.

  - Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 09:31:51 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.0
  - warning A new TOFU trust store will be created. The old one is kept around
    but ignored.
  - warning App state serialization format has been updated. Downgrading to a
    previous release will cause app state to be reset (e.g., tabs closed,
    navigation history cleared).
  - warning New build dependencies: HarfBuzz and GNU FriBidi (see README).
  - New features:
    - Added support for bidirectional text and complex scripts. العالم متنوع
    - Right-to-left paragraphs are aligned to the right. Link icons and
      list/quote symbols are moved to the right margin.
    - Added support for Titan uploads. The data to upload can be entered via a
      text field or by dropping a file on the window.
    - Added a keybinding for opening the current page URL in the upload dialog
      (Ctrl+U). This simply switches the page's URL scheme from gemini to titan.
    - Added a configuration file for defining the UI color palette (see Help,
      section 3.5).
    - Added settings for keyboard and mouse scrolling speeds.
    - Added setting for changing Return key behavior in input fields (line break
      vs. accept).
    - Added setting for adjusting line spacing.
    - Added link context menu item for deleting local files (e.g., downloads).
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Improved TOFU: if the server certificate is not trusted, the connection is
      aborted at the TLS handshake stage. Previously, only a warning was shown
      and the page contents were fetched regardless.
    - Server certificate fingerprints are generated based on public keys, which
      allows servers to renew their certificates without losing trusted status.
    - Improved handling of expired server certificates. An error page is shown
      and the connection is aborted at the TLS handshake stage. The user can
      give a temporary exception to load the page.
    - Page contents are cached in presentation form for quicker restoring during
      back/forward navigation.
    - Inline images/audio will not get discarded during back/forward navigation.
      The Network > Memory Size setting determines the maximum memory usage for
      media. Setting the Memory Size to zero is equivalent to the previous
      behavior of discarding everything when the page changes.
    - Debug information includes RAM use in addition to cache size. This
      includes document layout and media stored in memory (e.g., raw pixel data
      of images).
    - Text input fields support larger amounts of content and expand vertically
      only up to a limit, after which they start scrolling.
    - Preferences have been reorganized. There is a new Fonts tab, and some
      General settings have been moved to the Style tab. All color-related
      settings are on the Colors tab, including UI theme colors.
    - Links opened on a page are updated to reflect visited status even when
      opening into a background tab or to the side.
    - Unicode Byte Order Mark is ignored in the beginning of a page.
    - Updated Smol Emoji with new characters.
    - Query/Feeds indicators have a smaller appearance in a narrow window to
      leave room for the URL.
  - Fixes:
    - Large lede paragraph font is not applied if the paragraph has too many
      lines.
    - Fixed minor kerning issues when using Nunito.
    - Fixed sizing of characters in the Noto Symbols fonts.
    - Improved internal handling of URLs. For example, some URLs were not being
      recognized as visited because of percent-encoding differences.
    - Fixed URL in the generated page for viewing a single image (spaces weren't
      encoded).
    - Input dialog is not dismissed unless the Cancel button is clicked or
      Escape is pressed.
    - Workaround for a potential hang during the closing of a socket.
    - TLS client certificates generated by the app have identical issuer and
      subject fields, including all the provided information and not just the
      Common Name.
    - Gopher: Improved detection of ASCII art.
    - Gopher: Show contents of unrecognized line types.
    - Gopher: Don't collapse preformatted blocks since everything is
      preformatted in the source.
    - Gopher: All preformatted blocks are unindented to avoid misaligned ASCII
      art.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 16 15:50:08 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.2
  - Fixed pasting a PEM-formatted certificate and/or private key via clipboard
    in Import Identity.
  - Possible workaround for a visual glitch in the URL field.
  - Specify StartupWMClass in .desktop file.
  - Normalize page contents to avoid the most common issues with diacritics
    (Unicode NFC).
  - Expanded the set of recognized custom link icons.
  - Updated "Smol Emoji" font with new glyphs.
  - Allow use of TLS cipher "DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 14:41:51 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.1
  - Updated UI translations.
  - Updated "Smol Emoji" font with new and improved glyphs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 30 18:22:14 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.0
  - Added "Smol Emoji" and "Noto Sans Symbols" fonts, removed Symbola.
  - warning Many Emoji and pictographs defined in the last five years are
    currently missing.
  - Added document footer buttons: on certain pages (e.g., error messages) show
    relevant actions in the bottom of the page. For example, if a certificate is
    required for viewing a page, show buttons for creating a new identity and
    showing the Identities sidebar.
  - Error pages include the human-readable text sent by the server.
  - Disregard old feed entries whose unread status would have been forgotten.
  - Added UI language: Polish.
  - Identity management:
      - Revised New Identity dialog. An option is provided to automatically use
        the new identity on the current domain/page. The additional fields are
        hidden by default.
      - Improved usability of Identities sidebar. No more accidental
        activations: left-clicking an identity opens the context menu without
        making any changes. The context menu shows each active URL as a menu
        item for easy access. Identity icons reflect the usage status: all
        identities used on the current domain get highlighted in addition to the
        currently used one.
      - Identities can be exported: certificate and private key are opened in a
        new tab in plain text PEM format.
      - Fixed issues with identity usage: a higher-up URL overrides and
        deactivates all contained URLs to avoid redundant activation.
  - Text input:
      - Revised text input widgets: added support for multiple lines, and when
        entering user response to a query, show how many bytes are remaining for
        the response URL about to be submitted. In dialogs, input fields expand
        vertically instead of scrolling their content horizontally.
      - Input widgets allow inserting newlines using Shift+Return.
      - Disallow sending query responses that are too long (1024 bytes maximum).
      - Shift-click to select a range of text in input widgets (i.e, without
        dragging).
  - Rendering:
      - Animate showing and hiding of sidebars and dialogs. Animations are
        enabled by default, by can be disabled with Preferences > Interface >
        Animations.
      - Added setting for a custom TrueType symbol font for any missing
        characters. Note: Must be a .TTF file — OpenType and bitmap fonts are
        not supported.
      - Link navigation shortcut icons (home row and numbered) are drawn with a
        consistent appearance.
      - Improved icon alignment in lists.
      - Reduced line gap between word-wrapped top-level headings.
      - Modal dialog background dimming fades in/out smoothly.
  - Split view:
      - Added keybindings for split view menu items.
      - Changed default split view keys to conform to Emacs (3 for horizontal, 2
        for vertical split).
      - Fixes and improvements for touch screen event handling in split view
        mode.
  - Command line:
      - Added --url-or-search (-u) command line option. Depending on the
        parameter, either open an URL or make a search query.
      - Open all URLs/files specified on the command line in new tabs, and raise
        the window if the app is already running. (Kudos to Alyssa Rosenzweig.)
  - Gempub:
      - Linear navigation through the book with Left/Right arrow keys and via
        footer buttons. The navigation order is determined by links on the
        Gempub index page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 22 10:29:52 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.2
  - Fixed UI colors being all black on the first run.
  - Fixed right mouse click on an inactive split not having any effect.
  - Fixed action buttons showing under the Help link in an empty Identities
    sidebar.
  - Fixed potential crash at shutdown.
  - Fixed minor UI layout issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 13 15:50:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.1
  - Fixed removing the left side split by closing all its tabs. The URL input
    field got confused about which tab was currently open, and the wrong theme
    was active.
  - Fixed tab merging when unsplitting the window: keep the currently active tab
    open.
  - Fixed issue with sidebars sometimes becoming unresponsive.
  - Fixed font used for visited monospace Gopher links.
  - Fixed incorrectly shown/hidden ◧ indicator.
  - Fixed scrollbar in Preferences > Keys being hidden until the list is
    scrolled.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 19:09:26 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.0
  - Added split view modes: two tabs at once, horizontal/vertical split,
    1:1/2:1/1:2 weights, merge tabs, swap sides. See section 1.8 in Help for
    details.
  - Split view pinning: keep a page pinned on one side while all opened links go
    to the other side.
  - "file://" URLs can be used for viewing contents of local directories and ZIP
    archives.
  - Basic Gempub support: a cover page is generated based on metadata, and
    there's an automatic split view for index and contents. On macOS, Lagrange
    is registered as a viewer of .gpub files.
  - Bold link styling is used for indicating which links are unvisited.
  - Page rendering was optimized: now each line of text is rendered into the
    view buffer only once, and whenever the view is stationary, content is
    prefilled in the available space outside the viewport. Previously, at least
    one line of text was rendered every frame when the viewport was moving,
    which was mostly redundant.
  - Added UI languages: Interlingua, Toki Pona.
  - Added "New"/"Import" buttons in the bottom of the Identities tab.
  - Added an "All"/"Unread" mode switch in the bottom of the Feeds tab.
  - Added toggles for special tags in the bookmark creation/editor dialog.
  - Added "Show Downloads" to the File/main menu.
  - Added "Open Downloaded File" to the file save dialog to make it easy to find
    the local copy of the file.
  - Updated the UI font to Source Sans 3. It now has all the styles and weights
    needed for page rendering, too.
  - Added a semibold Fira Sans weight (used for unvisited links).
  - Preferences: Reorganized the fonts dropdown menu.
  - Changed popup dismiss behavior so that a click outside just dismisses the
    popup and does not trigger further actions.
  - All lists support smooth scrolling.
  - Multitouch scrolling: each finger can scroll a different widget.
  - Adjustments to how display DPI affects UI scaling.
  - Fixed allocation of page rendering buffers. Previously, some buffers may
    have gone unused or were allocated erroneously to the same position, causing
    unnecessary work for the page renderer.
  - Fixed various issues in the UI layout.
  - Fixed parsing URI scheme (limited set of characters allowed).
  - Don't percent encode equal signs in URL paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 26 18:59:12 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.4
  - Allow server certificates with a *.tld subject wildcard.
  - Updated the French UI translation.

    failed to be recognized.
  - Fixed crash after a redirect.
  - Fixed a rare issue with handling multiple rapid network requests.
  - Fixed a rare situation where a network connection would fail to open.
  - Minor stability improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 18 13:04:44 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.3
  - Added UI languages: French, German. (Note that neither is 100% finished
    yet.)
  - Added build option to disable IPC for compatibility reasons.
  - Added environment variable LAGRANGE_OVERRIDE_DPI.
  - Back/forward navigation buttons are disabled if they have no more pages to
    switch to.
  - Minor UI color tuning.
  - Fixed possible crash when closing a tab.
  - Fixed possible crash when restoring application state at launch.
  - Fixed problems parsing and making requests with literal IPv6 addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 11 16:32:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.2
  - Fixed crash after updating from v1.2 due to undefined CA file/path
    configuration.
  - Fixed conflation of pixel ratio and display DPI. Pixel ratio is now always
    separately detected so mouse events can be correctly positioned. You may
    find that adjusting the UI scale factor (Preferences > Interface) is
    necessary after upgrading.
  - Fixed sidebar width changing when moving the window to a different display.
  - Fixed inability to use Tab in keybindings.
  - Fixed opening Gopher URLs via drag-and-drop.
  - Fixed "Add bookmark..." on a feed entry.
  - Fixed keybindings list not being updated immediately when UI language
    changes.
  - Fixed trimming of link label text when a custom Emoji is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  5 17:43:32 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

  - Updated the Nunito font to the latest version.
  - Fixed crash during word wrapping.
  - Fixed keybindings overriding the home row key navigation mode.
  - Fixed kerning in the text renderer.
  - Fixed issue with overlapped drawing of list bullets vs. list items.
  - Fixed cropped list bullets when using Literata.
  - Fixed whitespace normalization in plain text files (tab characters).
  - Fixed issues buffering window contents, possibly causing missing font glyphs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 18:01:32 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.0
  - Localization
    - Added the first set of UI translations: Chinese (Simplified, Traditional),
      Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. Many thanks to the translators!
    - Added page content translation using a LibreTranslate instance running on
      xlt.skyjake.fi. This is somewhat experimental and may occasionally mess up
      Gemtext markup. Expect long pages to be quite slow to translate (more than
      a minute).
  - Resources
    - Added Noto Sans CJK (Simplified Chinese) font.
    - Added Noto Sans Arabic font. Note that right-to-left/bidirectional text
      rendering is not implemented yet.
    - Added "about:about" that lists all the available "about:" pages.
  - Browsing
    - Alt text is shown when hovering over a preformatted block.
    - Clicking on a preformatted block collapses it, leaving only the alt text.
    - Added option to collapse all preformatted blocks on page load.
    - A server certificate can also be verified by Certificate Authorities. When
      "CA file" and/or "CA path" are set in Preferences, CA verification will
      mark a certificate as trusted.
    - Relaxed TOFU certificate checking when it comes to domain names:
      domain.tld in a certificate is implicitly considered to also mean
      *.domain.tld.
    - Fixed handling of IDNs when the user sets a server certificate as trusted
      via the UI.
    - Fixed handling of unknown URI schemes. Previously they were forcefully
      converted to absolute URIs, breaking them.
  - Page content and rendering
    - Color adjustments to the "Colorful Dark", "Colorful Light", and "Gray"
      themes. "Gray" looks different in dark and light UI modes.
    - Spacing of bullet lists vs. link lists is more consistent.
    - Links are shown in bold, and tinted with the page theme color for more
      coherent appearance.
    - Custom link icons: Gemini links whose destination is on the same domain
      use as icon the Emoji or other pictograph at the start of the link label.
      (For example, see Astrobotany menus.)
    - Added option to wrap lines in plain text files. This is on by default
      because there is no horizontal scrolling for plain text.
    - Large images are downscaled to an appropriate size for presentation.
    - Improved font glyph caching to reduce stuttering during scrolling. All
      required glyphs are cached after a page load finishes. This allows more
      efficient copying of glyphs as the operations can be batched.
    - Larger content buffers for scrolling, reducing need to redraw content.
    - Gopher: Handling the 'h' line type.
    - Fixed minor issues with word wrapping.
    - Fixed minor blending artifacts with the current heading shown on the right
      side of the page.
  - User interface
    - Improved event handling to support touch screens on any platform (if
      supported by SDL).
    - UI scaling factor is applied immediately when closing Preferences.
      Restarting is no longer necessary.
    - Window rescaled automatically when moving it to a display with a different
      DPI.
    - Added unread feed entry count to the sidebar.
    - Added a context menu for toggling sidebars. The menu appears when
      right-clicking on the navbar or on the sidebar tab buttons.
    - Double/triple click selection modes. Double click and drag will select by
      word, triple click by paragraph.
    - Popup menus have icons for items to make it faster to find the item you're
      looking for.
    - Soft shadows for popup menus.
    - Scrollbars fade away on macOS/iOS and dim on other platforms.
    - Reload button moved into the URL field.
    - Narrow URL input fields will not display the default "gemini" scheme.
    - Domain name is highlighted in URL fields.
    - Added a cut/copy/paste context menu to input fields.
    - Added an "Import..." button to the empty Identities sidebar.
    - Preferences dialog was partially reorganized for clarity.
    - Tabs in Preferences look the same as tabs in the sidebar.
    - Cleaner appearance for unread feed items in the sidebar.
    - Dialog buttons show the corresponding shortcut key.
    - Fixed background activity indicators overlapping each other.
    - Fixed glitches when widgets extend beyond the left edge of the window.
    - Fixed use of plurals in UI strings, enabling support for three or more
      plural forms.
  - Keybindings
    - Default page scroll keybindings changed: PageUp/Down scroll a whole page,
      and Space/Shift+Space scrolls half a page. If you're changed these
      bindings, note that they will be reset to defaults.
    - Added keybinding for subscribing to a page.
    - Keyboard modifiers can be remapped using the modmap.txt configuration
      file.
    - Caps Lock can be used as a modifier key.
    - Internet hot keys (if present on a keyboard) can be used to navigate
      back/forward and reload the page.
  - Command line use
    - Added conventional --help, --version options.
    - A previously started instance can be controlled with command line options.
    - --list-tab-urls prints a list of the currently open URLs in the running
      instance.
  - Bug fixes
    - Only one instance of Lagrange is allowed to run per user directory. This
      prevents instances from overwriting each other's data.
    - Fixed use of multiple search terms for quick lookup.
    - Fixed handling of multiple feeds having an entry with the same URL.
    - Fixed percent-decoding of URLs on the command line and coming in via
      system URL handlers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Feb 27 15:02:24 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.2.0
  - New features
    - Atom feed subscriptions: Atom XML documents are automatically converted to
      Gemini feed index pages. This is a built-in version of the Atom-to-Gemini
      example on the Help page.
    - Inline downloads: right-click on any link that is openable inside Lagrange
      and select "Download Linked File".
    - Editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol
      to represent a bookmarked site.
    - Searching via URL field: non-URL text entered in the field is passed onto
      the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is
      shown if a query will take place.
    - Tab auto-reloading: configure a reloading interval using the page context
      menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). Auto-reloading is part of the persistent
      state of the tab.
    - "Iosevka" and "Source Sans Pro" (the UI font) can be used as heading and
      body fonts.
    - User preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
    - Keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode.
    - Keybinding for finding text on page.
  - UI design
    - Enhanced navbar: adjusted spacing, URL field has a maximum width, tab
      titles have less pronounced borders.
    - Improved sidebar appearance: bold subheadings, larger feed icons, adjusted
      spacing, background color.
    - Font consistency: all UI elements use the same font (i.e., no more
      monospace input fields).
    - Added setting for UI accent color (teal, orange).
    - General fine-tuning of the color palette.
    - Dialog buttons are aligned to the right edge, leaving room for additional
      action buttons on the left.
    - Page Information button is embedded in the URL field.
    - Page Information dialog is attached to its button.
    - Site icons use a different color in tab titles for visual distinction.
    - Fade background behind modal dialogs.
    - Responsive page margins.
  - Other changes
    - Help is opened on first run instead of the "About Lagrange" page to make
      it easier to discover important Gemini links like the FAQ.
    - "Go to Root" respects a user name found in the URL. One can still "Go to
      Parent" to get above the user level.
    - Feed entries are sorted by refresh time if they are published on the same
      date.
    - Don't show future-dated feed entries in Feeds.
    - Middle-clicking on links: open new tab in background or foreground
      depending on the Shift key.
    - Shift+Insert can be used for pasting clipboard contents into input fields.
    - Removed a strange violet-on-green color theme pairing.
  - Bug fixes
    - Fixed text prompt dialogs closing and accepting the entered text when
      switching focus away from the app.
    - Scroll position remains fixed while horizontally resizing the window or
      sidebars.
    - Fixed a crash when opening the audio player menu.
    - Fixed Gopher requests that were using URL (percent) encoded characters.
