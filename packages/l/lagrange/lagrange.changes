Sun Apr 11 16:32:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.2
  - Fixed crash after updating from v1.2 due to undefined CA file/path
    configuration.
  - Fixed conflation of pixel ratio and display DPI. Pixel ratio is now always
    separately detected so mouse events can be correctly positioned. You may
    find that adjusting the UI scale factor (Preferences > Interface) is
    necessary after upgrading.

  - Fixed inability to use Tab in keybindings.
  - Fixed opening Gopher URLs via drag-and-drop.
  - Fixed "Add bookmark..." on a feed entry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 18:01:32 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.0
  - Localization
    - Added the first set of UI translations: Chinese (Simplified, Traditional),
      Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. Many thanks to the translators!
    - Added page content translation using a LibreTranslate instance running on
      xlt.skyjake.fi. This is somewhat experimental and may occasionally mess up
      Gemtext markup. Expect long pages to be quite slow to translate (more than
      a minute).
  - Resources
    - Added Noto Sans CJK (Simplified Chinese) font.
    - Added Noto Sans Arabic font. Note that right-to-left/bidirectional text
      rendering is not implemented yet.
    - Added "about:about" that lists all the available "about:" pages.
  - Browsing
    - Alt text is shown when hovering over a preformatted block.
    - Clicking on a preformatted block collapses it, leaving only the alt text.
    - Added option to collapse all preformatted blocks on page load.
    - A server certificate can also be verified by Certificate Authorities. When
      "CA file" and/or "CA path" are set in Preferences, CA verification will
      mark a certificate as trusted.
    - Relaxed TOFU certificate checking when it comes to domain names:
      domain.tld in a certificate is implicitly considered to also mean
      *.domain.tld.
    - Fixed handling of IDNs when the user sets a server certificate as trusted
      via the UI.
    - Fixed handling of unknown URI schemes. Previously they were forcefully
      converted to absolute URIs, breaking them.
  - Page content and rendering
    - Color adjustments to the "Colorful Dark", "Colorful Light", and "Gray"
      themes. "Gray" looks different in dark and light UI modes.
    - Spacing of bullet lists vs. link lists is more consistent.
    - Links are shown in bold, and tinted with the page theme color for more
      coherent appearance.
    - Custom link icons: Gemini links whose destination is on the same domain
      use as icon the Emoji or other pictograph at the start of the link label.
      (For example, see Astrobotany menus.)
    - Added option to wrap lines in plain text files. This is on by default
      because there is no horizontal scrolling for plain text.
    - Large images are downscaled to an appropriate size for presentation.
    - Improved font glyph caching to reduce stuttering during scrolling. All
      required glyphs are cached after a page load finishes. This allows more
      efficient copying of glyphs as the operations can be batched.
    - Larger content buffers for scrolling, reducing need to redraw content.
    - Gopher: Handling the 'h' line type.
    - Fixed minor issues with word wrapping.
    - Fixed minor blending artifacts with the current heading shown on the right
      side of the page.
  - User interface
    - Improved event handling to support touch screens on any platform (if
      supported by SDL).
    - UI scaling factor is applied immediately when closing Preferences.
      Restarting is no longer necessary.
    - Window rescaled automatically when moving it to a display with a different
      DPI.
    - Added unread feed entry count to the sidebar.
    - Added a context menu for toggling sidebars. The menu appears when
      right-clicking on the navbar or on the sidebar tab buttons.
    - Double/triple click selection modes. Double click and drag will select by
      word, triple click by paragraph.
    - Popup menus have icons for items to make it faster to find the item you're
      looking for.
    - Soft shadows for popup menus.
    - Scrollbars fade away on macOS/iOS and dim on other platforms.
    - Reload button moved into the URL field.
    - Narrow URL input fields will not display the default "gemini" scheme.
    - Domain name is highlighted in URL fields.
    - Added a cut/copy/paste context menu to input fields.
    - Added an "Import..." button to the empty Identities sidebar.
    - Preferences dialog was partially reorganized for clarity.
    - Tabs in Preferences look the same as tabs in the sidebar.
    - Cleaner appearance for unread feed items in the sidebar.
    - Dialog buttons show the corresponding shortcut key.
    - Fixed background activity indicators overlapping each other.
    - Fixed glitches when widgets extend beyond the left edge of the window.
    - Fixed use of plurals in UI strings, enabling support for three or more
      plural forms.
  - Keybindings
    - Default page scroll keybindings changed: PageUp/Down scroll a whole page,
      and Space/Shift+Space scrolls half a page. If you're changed these
      bindings, note that they will be reset to defaults.
    - Added keybinding for subscribing to a page.
    - Keyboard modifiers can be remapped using the modmap.txt configuration
      file.
    - Caps Lock can be used as a modifier key.
    - Internet hot keys (if present on a keyboard) can be used to navigate
      back/forward and reload the page.
  - Command line use
    - Added conventional --help, --version options.
    - A previously started instance can be controlled with command line options.
    - --list-tab-urls prints a list of the currently open URLs in the running
      instance.
  - Bug fixes
    - Only one instance of Lagrange is allowed to run per user directory. This
      prevents instances from overwriting each other's data.
    - Fixed use of multiple search terms for quick lookup.
    - Fixed handling of multiple feeds having an entry with the same URL.
    - Fixed percent-decoding of URLs on the command line and coming in via
      system URL handlers.

  - CMake: Automatically check if lib/the_Foundation is up-to-date.
  - CMake: Build configuration fails if an SSL library is not found.

- update to 1.2.0
  - New features
    - Atom feed subscriptions: Atom XML documents are automatically converted to
      Gemini feed index pages. This is a built-in version of the Atom-to-Gemini
      example on the Help page.
    - Inline downloads: right-click on any link that is openable inside Lagrange
      and select "Download Linked File".
    - Editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol
      to represent a bookmarked site.
    - Searching via URL field: non-URL text entered in the field is passed onto
      the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is
      shown if a query will take place.
    - Tab auto-reloading: configure a reloading interval using the page context
      menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). Auto-reloading is part of the persistent
      state of the tab.
    - "Iosevka" and "Source Sans Pro" (the UI font) can be used as heading and
      body fonts.
    - User preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
    - Keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode.

      titles have less pronounced borders.
    - Improved sidebar appearance: bold subheadings, larger feed icons, adjusted
      spacing, background color.
    - Font consistency: all UI elements use the same font (i.e., no more
      monospace input fields).
    - Added setting for UI accent color (teal, orange).
    - General fine-tuning of the color palette.
    - Dialog buttons are aligned to the right edge, leaving room for additional
      action buttons on the left.
    - Page Information button is embedded in the URL field.
    - Page Information dialog is attached to its button.
    - Site icons use a different color in tab titles for visual distinction.
    - Fade background behind modal dialogs.
    - Responsive page margins.
  - Other changes
    - Help is opened on first run instead of the "About Lagrange" page to make
      it easier to discover important Gemini links like the FAQ.
    - "Go to Root" respects a user name found in the URL. One can still "Go to
      Parent" to get above the user level.
    - Feed entries are sorted by refresh time if they are published on the same
      date.
    - Don't show future-dated feed entries in Feeds.
    - Middle-clicking on links: open new tab in background or foreground
      depending on the Shift key.
