Sat Feb 27 15:02:24 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.2.0
  - New features
    - Atom feed subscriptions: Atom XML documents are automatically converted to
      Gemini feed index pages. This is a built-in version of the Atom-to-Gemini
      example on the Help page.
    - Inline downloads: right-click on any link that is openable inside Lagrange
      and select "Download Linked File".
    - Editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol
      to represent a bookmarked site.
    - Searching via URL field: non-URL text entered in the field is passed onto
      the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is
      shown if a query will take place.
    - Tab auto-reloading: configure a reloading interval using the page context
      menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). Auto-reloading is part of the persistent
      state of the tab.
    - "Iosevka" and "Source Sans Pro" (the UI font) can be used as heading and
      body fonts.
    - User preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
    - Keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode.
    - Keybinding for finding text on page.
  - UI design
    - Enhanced navbar: adjusted spacing, URL field has a maximum width, tab
      titles have less pronounced borders.
    - Improved sidebar appearance: bold subheadings, larger feed icons, adjusted
      spacing, background color.
    - Font consistency: all UI elements use the same font (i.e., no more
      monospace input fields).
    - Added setting for UI accent color (teal, orange).
    - General fine-tuning of the color palette.
    - Dialog buttons are aligned to the right edge, leaving room for additional
      action buttons on the left.
    - Page Information button is embedded in the URL field.
    - Page Information dialog is attached to its button.
    - Site icons use a different color in tab titles for visual distinction.
    - Fade background behind modal dialogs.
    - Responsive page margins.
  - Other changes
    - Help is opened on first run instead of the "About Lagrange" page to make
      it easier to discover important Gemini links like the FAQ.
    - "Go to Root" respects a user name found in the URL. One can still "Go to
      Parent" to get above the user level.
    - Feed entries are sorted by refresh time if they are published on the same
      date.
    - Don't show future-dated feed entries in Feeds.
    - Middle-clicking on links: open new tab in background or foreground
      depending on the Shift key.
    - Shift+Insert can be used for pasting clipboard contents into input fields.
    - Removed a strange violet-on-green color theme pairing.
  - Bug fixes
    - Fixed text prompt dialogs closing and accepting the entered text when
      switching focus away from the app.
    - Scroll position remains fixed while horizontally resizing the window or
      sidebars.
    - Fixed a crash when opening the audio player menu.
    - Fixed Gopher requests that were using URL (percent) encoded characters.
