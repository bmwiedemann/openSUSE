Thu Jan 20 21:05:18 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.10.1
  - Fixed bottom actions of the Feeds sidebar getting hidden when all entries
    are read. This prevented switching between Unread/All filter modes.
  - Fixed potential crash when downloading a large file (e.g., a fontpack).
  - Linux: SDL event handling workaround adjusted to only apply to 2.0.18+.
  - Updated UI translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 17 17:28:51 UTC 2022 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.10.0
  - New features:
    - Customizable navbar actions. Right-click on a button to change its action.
      (Identity and hamburger buttons cannot be changed.)
    - Identity toolbar menu can be used to switch between alternate identities.
      If you have used multiple identities on one site, this makes it more
      convenient to switch between them.
    - Added "Edit Page with Titan": opens the upload dialog with current page's
      content prefilled.
    - Added "Paste Preceding Line" in the input prompt dialog. Potential use
      cases include user-editable sections on a page and suggested/example input
      values.
    - Added footer action to open file in another app when the media type is
      unsupported.
    - Added option to disable cursor blinking in input fields.
    - Added ANSI SGR codes for light and regular font weights (2, 10).
    - macOS: Added "Show in Finder" in the Identities sidebar.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Improved image inlining: all responses with an image media type can get
      inlined, regardless of the file extension in the URL.
    - Inline image metadata goes under the image instead of possibly overlapping
      the label text.
    - Inline downloads have a context menu for relevant actions, and clicking on
      the download opens the file.
    - Improved highlighting of open pages. The highlight no longer goes under
      the side elements on the page.
    - Entry dates in feed links are de-emphasized for improved readability.
    - Revised link hover popup. None of the information appears on the same line
      any more (which was problematic if there wasn't enough space). Instead,
      everything is shown in a popup at the bottom/top of the view, including
      the identity that will be used when opening the link and the date of last
      visit.
    - Revised layout of the Upload dialog. There is a new edit field that lets
      you modify the file path of the URL. Identity names are in bold.
    - Optimized UI layout procedure and memory use during UI event processing.
    - Audio subsystem is only initialized when actually needed.
    - Prevent state file corruption if the app happens to get killed while state
      is being saved.
    - Gempub: Open books in 1:2 split mode instead of 1:1.
    - Minor improvements in page caching.
    - Detect when text is Bengali, Devanagari, Oriya, or Tamil.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed a history caching issue: if there were multiple instances of the
      same URL in history, only the latest one's content would be used when
      navigating back/forward.
    - Fixed handling of reserved characters in URLs (cf. RFC 3986, section 2.2).
    - Fixed the copy/paste context menu not showing in input fields.
    - Fixed duplicated warnings showing in the page banner.
    - Fixed very narrow input fields causing the app to hang.
    - Fixed initial scroll position in multiline input fields.
    - Fixed layout issues in the sidebar on empty Feeds and Identities tabs.
    - Fixed lookup results list becoming too narrow.
    - Fixed glitches when a widget has multiple simultanous animations.
    - Fixed mixed-language CJK word wrapping.
    - Fixed parsing Atom feed dates with leading whitespace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 29 19:46:09 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.9.1
  - Added "24-Hour Time" preference. Currently it only affects the page
    timestamp in the bottom left corner.
  - Heading level 3 is indented like regular text lines, making the difference
    to level 2 evident.
  - Fixed crash when creating a top-level bookmark.
  - Fixed drawing the page timestamp.
  - Fixed layout of tab buttons and other resizing widgets so all available
    space is used.
  - Fixed tab close buttons preventing activation of very short tab buttons. The
    close buttons only appear if there is room for them.
  - Fixed very short tab labels not getting truncated.
  - Fixed the New Tab button not staying at the right edge of the window,
    depending on how many tabs are open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov 27 13:43:18 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.9.0
  - New features:
    - Added a toolbar button for toggling the left sidebar.
    - Added an unsplit button in the toolbar when in split view mode.
    - Choose parent folder when creating or editing a bookmark.
    - Support for 24-bit RGB ANSI color sequences.
    - Support for ANSI background color escapes (disabled by default).
    - UI language for Turkish.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Adjusted font styles of heading levels 2 and 3.
    - Sidebar context menus also appear when clicking over the sidebar
      background. In this case the menu contains general functions not related
      to any item.
    - Feeds tab in the sidebar has a redesigned action toolbar with "Mark All as
      Read", and dropdown menu and keyboard shortcuts for changing the filter
      mode.
    - Feeds tab remembers the unread/all filter mode persistently.
    - ANSI foreground colors are modified to match colored theme backgrounds
      (e.g., Sepia).
    - Navigating back and forward in history will skip input query prompts
      (status 1x), showing only the query results.
    - Ctrl+A now selects all text in input fields.
    - The resource bundle (resources.lgr) is now a regular ZIP archive. This
      allows it to do double duty as a fontpack containing the built-in fonts.
      The archive contains a version number to avoid use of obsolete resources.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed layout issues related to footer action buttons. Sometimes the
      buttons would overlap page content.
    - Fixed handling duplicate feed entries: if multiple entries in a feed have
      the same URL, only use the first one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Nov 22 07:22:44 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.8.3
  - Fixed clicking on UI elements that are over the page top banner. The banner
    would always get clicked instead.
  - Titan upload identity is remembered as a site-specific setting. It is no
    longer affected by selections in the Identities sidebar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Nov 18 20:41:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.8.2
  - Fixed encoding of + characters in URLs as per RFC 3986.
  - Fixed crash when fontpack.ini specifies a file that cannot be found.

    Now the unique font ID will be included in these cases.
  - Made it possible to manually trust a certificate whose subject doesn't match
    domain name.
  - Updated UI translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Nov  6 19:57:17 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.8.1
  - Added UI translations: Hungarian, Czech.
  - Added the zip utility as a build requirement. It is used for making
    fontpacks.
  - Fixed build failure with the simple text renderer, i.e., when HarfBuzz is
    disabled.
  - Fixed issues scrolling tall popup menus (e.g., UI language selection).
  - Fixed a line spacing artifact in long headings. With some fonts, the lines
    were clipping each other so the spacing was restored to normal.
  - Fixed a socket I/O issue that caused received data to be ignored when the
    peer closed the connection prematurely.
  - Gopher: Recognize both LF and CRLF line endings in page content.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Oct 30 19:18:41 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.8.0
  - warning Font settings will be reset to defaults. Only a minimal set of fonts
    is bundled with the app. If additional fonts are needed, one can use custom
    TrueType fonts or download some from the Font Library.
  - New features:
    - Added a customizable font library. Open "about:fonts" to view and manage
      the installed fonts.
    - Added TrueType fonts as a recognized content type. When one is viewed in
      the app (e.g., via a drag-and-drop), there is an option to install it as a
      user font.
    - Added fontpacks: ZIP archives containing one or more TrueType fonts and
      parameters about how they should be used.
    - Added support for TrueType collections (.ttc).
    - Added new font options: separate preformatted and monospace body fonts, UI
      font, smoothing.
    - Added style option to show all links as bold regardless of visited status.
    - Added warning message about missing font glyphs.
    - Added warning message about terminal emulation. Lagrange supports a small
      subset of ANSI escape sequences, so page appearance may be incorrect when
      these are used in content.
    - Added tab close buttons.
    - Added style option to show links as bold regardless of visited status.
    - Added a feed subscription option to exclude web links (HTTP/HTTPS), since
      those are not viewable in the app by default.
    - Added an automatic conversion of Markdown to Gemtext when viewing local
      files. (Not all Markdown features are supported.)
    - Added UI language for Ukrainian (uk).
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Removed all alternative built-in content fonts.
    - The default content font is Source Sans, same as the UI font.
    - Redesigned error/warning messages. These now show up as part of the page
      top banner, and their appearance can no longer be replicated via Gemtext.
    - Warning messages are interactive. Click on them to perform relevant
      actions.
    - Per-pixel scrolling in input fields (e.g., when using a trackpad on
      macOS).
    - "file://" pages are always unthemed.
    - Show a byte counter during large downloads instead of instantly jumping to
      a content view. Content may not viewable correctly until the download has
      finished.
    - Site-specific settings (sitespec.txt) converted to .ini format. These are
      currently used for the Titan upload port and remembering which warnings
      have been dismissed.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where the page is unscrollable until the mouse cursor is
      moved (wrong hover state).
    - Fixed wrapping of long input prompts and dialog messages.
    - Titan upload token is remembered when the dialog is closed.
    - Fixed various layout issues with page footer buttons.
    - Fixed theme change glitches when an input prompt appears.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    from the start position or when starting from outside any text run.
  - Fixed a crash when clicking on Outline sidebar items before a page has
    finished loading.
  - Gopher: Handle the p line type (PNG image).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Oct  3 07:02:44 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.7.1
  - Fixed feed entries forgetting their (un)read status after several months.
  - Fixed feed entries being discarded before they are removed from their source
    feed, causing them to reappear on the next refresh.
  - Fixed failure to parse Atom feed entry timestamps that use space as the
    date/time separator.
  - Fixed dropdown labels staying visible in the translation dialog.
  - Fixed showing/hiding of the feed update indicator in split view.
  - Fixed a crash when selecting text.
  - Added a small progress bar to the feed update indicator.
  - When adding a bookmark/folder, the bookmarks list scrolls to show the new
    item.
  - Improved reordering bookmarks in a folder: an item inside a folder can be
    moved to be the last item in the folder, or out of the folder depending on
    which side of the boundary marker the mouse cursor is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 28 19:34:41 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.7.0
  - Warning! Bookmarks file format has changed. Your existing bookmarks will be
    imported to the new format. The old bookmarks.txt file can be found in the
    config directory and is writable only by v1.6 and earlier versions.
  - Warning! Saved UI state format has changed. Downgrading will reset window
    state, close all tabs, and clear the navigation cache.
  - New features:
    - Added bookmark folders. Folders can be nested inside each other, and the
      fold state of each folder is remembered persistently (per sidebar).
    - The Bookmarks export/list page uses subheadings (level 2 and 3) to
      represent folders.
    - Added menu item to sort (a folder of) bookmarks alphabetically.
    - Added identity selection in the Upload dialog.
    - Added image colorization setting. Images can be viewed in grayscale or
      using the page's theme colors.
    - Added UI focus cycling to all buttons with Tab and Shift+Tab. This
      includes dialog buttons and the navigation bar.
    - Added a footer action to view application/octet-stream content depending
      on recognized file extensions.
    - Added support for viewing WebP images. The libwebp library is an optional
      dependency and will be included in the build if found via pkg-config.
    - Added command line options -w, -h for setting window size at launch.
    - Added new UI languages: Esperanto, Spanish (Mexico), Galician,
      Interslavic, and Slovak. Note that some of these are still works in
      progress.
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Bookmarks are now ordered manually. You can drag and drop bookmarks in the
      list to change the order.
    - The internal bookmarks file format is now a TOML subset instead of just
      being three text lines per bookmark, making it more robust and
      human-readable.
    - Context menus and other popup menus that do not fit inside the window are
      split off into independent windows.
    - Dropdown button menus position themselves on the currently selected item.
    - Dialogs that don't fit inside the window have a scroll bar. Note that such
      dialogs can only be scrolled via mouse wheel/trackpad, not by dragging the
      bar.
    - Adjusted mouse wheel smooth scrolling speed for better consistency. The
      default scrolling speeds were increased to level 2.
    - Visited URLs are remembered for six months. This affects the unread status
      of feed entries and the visited status of links.
    - Adjusted the UI color palette so that the alternative accent color is used
      more rarely. For example, input fields now use the primary accent color.
    - Adjusted button hover/press colors for better consistency, particularly
      when the button label uses a non-standard color.
    - Image links (as determined by file extension) automatically use a "photo"
      link icon if the URL is on the current site. This makes it clearer which
      links will likely show up as an inline image.
    - Alt+Shift+Tab inserts a tab character in input fields.
    - UI rendering optimizations. Some UI controls (e.g., navbar, menus) will
      buffer their contents so they can be drawn efficiently during animations.
  - Fixes:
    - Fixed issues with subscribed feed entry tracking. Heading entries are not
      discarded until they are removed from the source.
    - Fixed the sidebar unread entry count showing the wrong number after
      subscribing to a Headings feed.
    - Fixed handling of tab characters in the Upload text editor (when using
      HarfBuzz).
    - Fixed hang when wrapping a very long word (with HarfBuzz disabled).
    - Fixed regressions in retaining window state, position, and size.
    - Fixed URL encoding of the % character.
    - Fixed ambiguous handling of colons in URI paths.
    - Fixed issues with cursor positioning in multi-line input fields.
    - Fixed issues with touch swipe events.
    - X11: Ask SDL not to bypass the window compositor. This should avoid issues
      on KDE, for example.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Sep  1 19:32:57 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.5
  - Audio init errors are no longer fatal. SDL's error message will still be
    printed.
  - Fixed appearance of tab buttons (should have no top frame).
  - Fixed a cursor position regression in input fields related to handling of
    variation selectors (codepoint clusters). Moving the cursor to the start of
    a wrapped line segment put the cursor in the wrong place.
  - Fixed right-clicking on sidebar tab buttons. It was showing the wrong
    context menu when the list had been scrolled down.
  - Fixed crash when using the SDL2 KMSDRM video driver.
  - Fixed minor visual artifacts in preformatted blocks and near the bottom of
    the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 22 09:27:19 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.4
  - Local files containing UTF-8 text can be viewed regardless of their file
    extension.
  - Fixed input field cursor positioning and insertion problems around Emoji
    variation selectors.
  - Fixed "Unknown Status Code" shown in Page Information for valid status
    codes.
  - Fixed an issue with network requests that would make it appear the server
    was not responding, but the request would not time out.
  - Fixed a potential invalid memory access when clicking on sidebar items.
  - OpenBSD: Fixed a freeze after a network request is cancelled.
  - Fixed page contents not reflowing during a window resize.
  - Added build option ENABLE_RESIZE_DRAW. SDL doesn't redraw window contents on
    all platforms during resizing, so this can be used to force it.
- Removed patch lagrange-1.6.3-Updated-AppData.patch. Applied upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 15 11:46:07 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- Added patch lagrange-1.6.3-Updated-AppData.patch
  (on git this was released as a version 1.6.3-1)

  - Input fields do not lose focus when the window becomes inactive, making it
    easier to resume input afterwards.
  - Fixed delay after switching to split view mode.
  - Fixed what gets drawn in an empty tab, before a document is available for
    rendering (e.g., after switching to split view mode).
  - Fixed highlighting the domain name in URL input fields.
  - Fixed hiding the Gemini URL scheme in input fields when the window is
    narrow.
  - Fixed the line break key modifier inadvertently affecting URL input fields,
    where line breaks are not allowed.
  - Fixed the line break key modifier affecting the upload dialog's text field.
  - Fixed a potential hang when closing a socket before the connection is fully
    opened.

    segment.
  - Scroll with mouse wheel in input fields.
  - Slower cursor blink rate in input fields.
  - Adjusted dark mode colors for focused input fields.
  - Fixed incorrect behavior in input fields when typing or deleting text while
    holding down the Shift key.
  - Fixed crash in Upload dialog if server responds with a redirect.
  - Fixed buffered graphics (UI, fonts) getting lost under rare circumstances.
  - Fixed drawing of wrapped text when the app is compiled without HarfBuzz.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 30 10:02:45 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.1
  - Fixed potential crash when inserting a line break in an input field.
  - Fixed cursor positioning in fixed-length input fields.

  - Updated translations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 09:31:51 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.0
  - warning A new TOFU trust store will be created. The old one is kept around
    but ignored.
  - warning App state serialization format has been updated. Downgrading to a
    previous release will cause app state to be reset (e.g., tabs closed,
    navigation history cleared).
  - warning New build dependencies: HarfBuzz and GNU FriBidi (see README).
  - New features:
    - Added support for bidirectional text and complex scripts. العالم متنوع
    - Right-to-left paragraphs are aligned to the right. Link icons and
      list/quote symbols are moved to the right margin.
    - Added support for Titan uploads. The data to upload can be entered via a
      text field or by dropping a file on the window.
    - Added a keybinding for opening the current page URL in the upload dialog
      (Ctrl+U). This simply switches the page's URL scheme from gemini to titan.
    - Added a configuration file for defining the UI color palette (see Help,
      section 3.5).
    - Added settings for keyboard and mouse scrolling speeds.
    - Added setting for changing Return key behavior in input fields (line break
      vs. accept).
    - Added setting for adjusting line spacing.
    - Added link context menu item for deleting local files (e.g., downloads).
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Improved TOFU: if the server certificate is not trusted, the connection is
      aborted at the TLS handshake stage. Previously, only a warning was shown
      and the page contents were fetched regardless.
    - Server certificate fingerprints are generated based on public keys, which
      allows servers to renew their certificates without losing trusted status.
    - Improved handling of expired server certificates. An error page is shown
      and the connection is aborted at the TLS handshake stage. The user can
      give a temporary exception to load the page.
    - Page contents are cached in presentation form for quicker restoring during
      back/forward navigation.
    - Inline images/audio will not get discarded during back/forward navigation.
      The Network > Memory Size setting determines the maximum memory usage for
      media. Setting the Memory Size to zero is equivalent to the previous
      behavior of discarding everything when the page changes.
    - Debug information includes RAM use in addition to cache size. This
      includes document layout and media stored in memory (e.g., raw pixel data
      of images).
    - Text input fields support larger amounts of content and expand vertically
      only up to a limit, after which they start scrolling.
    - Preferences have been reorganized. There is a new Fonts tab, and some
      General settings have been moved to the Style tab. All color-related
      settings are on the Colors tab, including UI theme colors.
    - Links opened on a page are updated to reflect visited status even when
      opening into a background tab or to the side.
    - Unicode Byte Order Mark is ignored in the beginning of a page.
    - Updated Smol Emoji with new characters.
    - Query/Feeds indicators have a smaller appearance in a narrow window to
      leave room for the URL.
  - Fixes:
    - Large lede paragraph font is not applied if the paragraph has too many
      lines.
    - Fixed minor kerning issues when using Nunito.
    - Fixed sizing of characters in the Noto Symbols fonts.
    - Improved internal handling of URLs. For example, some URLs were not being
      recognized as visited because of percent-encoding differences.
    - Fixed URL in the generated page for viewing a single image (spaces weren't
      encoded).
    - Input dialog is not dismissed unless the Cancel button is clicked or
      Escape is pressed.
    - Workaround for a potential hang during the closing of a socket.
    - TLS client certificates generated by the app have identical issuer and
      subject fields, including all the provided information and not just the
      Common Name.
    - Gopher: Improved detection of ASCII art.
    - Gopher: Show contents of unrecognized line types.
    - Gopher: Don't collapse preformatted blocks since everything is
      preformatted in the source.
    - Gopher: All preformatted blocks are unindented to avoid misaligned ASCII
      art.

- update to 1.5.0
  - Added "Smol Emoji" and "Noto Sans Symbols" fonts, removed Symbola.
  - warning Many Emoji and pictographs defined in the last five years are
    currently missing.
  - Added document footer buttons: on certain pages (e.g., error messages) show
    relevant actions in the bottom of the page. For example, if a certificate is
    required for viewing a page, show buttons for creating a new identity and
    showing the Identities sidebar.
  - Error pages include the human-readable text sent by the server.
  - Disregard old feed entries whose unread status would have been forgotten.
  - Added UI language: Polish.
  - Identity management:
      - Revised New Identity dialog. An option is provided to automatically use
        the new identity on the current domain/page. The additional fields are
        hidden by default.
      - Improved usability of Identities sidebar. No more accidental
        activations: left-clicking an identity opens the context menu without
        making any changes. The context menu shows each active URL as a menu
        item for easy access. Identity icons reflect the usage status: all
        identities used on the current domain get highlighted in addition to the
        currently used one.
      - Identities can be exported: certificate and private key are opened in a
        new tab in plain text PEM format.
      - Fixed issues with identity usage: a higher-up URL overrides and
        deactivates all contained URLs to avoid redundant activation.
  - Text input:
      - Revised text input widgets: added support for multiple lines, and when
        entering user response to a query, show how many bytes are remaining for
        the response URL about to be submitted. In dialogs, input fields expand
        vertically instead of scrolling their content horizontally.
      - Input widgets allow inserting newlines using Shift+Return.
      - Disallow sending query responses that are too long (1024 bytes maximum).
      - Shift-click to select a range of text in input widgets (i.e, without
        dragging).
  - Rendering:
      - Animate showing and hiding of sidebars and dialogs. Animations are
        enabled by default, by can be disabled with Preferences > Interface >
        Animations.
      - Added setting for a custom TrueType symbol font for any missing
        characters. Note: Must be a .TTF file — OpenType and bitmap fonts are
        not supported.
      - Link navigation shortcut icons (home row and numbered) are drawn with a
        consistent appearance.
      - Improved icon alignment in lists.
      - Reduced line gap between word-wrapped top-level headings.
      - Modal dialog background dimming fades in/out smoothly.
  - Split view:
      - Added keybindings for split view menu items.
      - Changed default split view keys to conform to Emacs (3 for horizontal, 2
        for vertical split).
      - Fixes and improvements for touch screen event handling in split view
        mode.
  - Command line:
      - Added --url-or-search (-u) command line option. Depending on the
        parameter, either open an URL or make a search query.
      - Open all URLs/files specified on the command line in new tabs, and raise
        the window if the app is already running. (Kudos to Alyssa Rosenzweig.)
  - Gempub:
      - Linear navigation through the book with Left/Right arrow keys and via
        footer buttons. The navigation order is determined by links on the
        Gempub index page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 22 10:29:52 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.2
  - Fixed UI colors being all black on the first run.
  - Fixed right mouse click on an inactive split not having any effect.
  - Fixed action buttons showing under the Help link in an empty Identities
    sidebar.
  - Fixed potential crash at shutdown.
  - Fixed minor UI layout issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 13 15:50:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.1
  - Fixed removing the left side split by closing all its tabs. The URL input
    field got confused about which tab was currently open, and the wrong theme
    was active.
  - Fixed tab merging when unsplitting the window: keep the currently active tab
    open.
  - Fixed issue with sidebars sometimes becoming unresponsive.
  - Fixed font used for visited monospace Gopher links.
  - Fixed incorrectly shown/hidden ◧ indicator.
  - Fixed scrollbar in Preferences > Keys being hidden until the list is
    scrolled.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 19:09:26 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.0
  - Added split view modes: two tabs at once, horizontal/vertical split,
    1:1/2:1/1:2 weights, merge tabs, swap sides. See section 1.8 in Help for
    details.
  - Split view pinning: keep a page pinned on one side while all opened links go
    to the other side.
  - "file://" URLs can be used for viewing contents of local directories and ZIP
    archives.
  - Basic Gempub support: a cover page is generated based on metadata, and
    there's an automatic split view for index and contents. On macOS, Lagrange
    is registered as a viewer of .gpub files.
  - Bold link styling is used for indicating which links are unvisited.
  - Page rendering was optimized: now each line of text is rendered into the
    view buffer only once, and whenever the view is stationary, content is
    prefilled in the available space outside the viewport. Previously, at least
    one line of text was rendered every frame when the viewport was moving,
    which was mostly redundant.
  - Added UI languages: Interlingua, Toki Pona.
  - Added "New"/"Import" buttons in the bottom of the Identities tab.
  - Added an "All"/"Unread" mode switch in the bottom of the Feeds tab.
  - Added toggles for special tags in the bookmark creation/editor dialog.
  - Added "Show Downloads" to the File/main menu.
  - Added "Open Downloaded File" to the file save dialog to make it easy to find
    the local copy of the file.
  - Updated the UI font to Source Sans 3. It now has all the styles and weights
    needed for page rendering, too.
  - Added a semibold Fira Sans weight (used for unvisited links).
  - Preferences: Reorganized the fonts dropdown menu.
  - Changed popup dismiss behavior so that a click outside just dismisses the
    popup and does not trigger further actions.
  - All lists support smooth scrolling.
  - Multitouch scrolling: each finger can scroll a different widget.
  - Adjustments to how display DPI affects UI scaling.
  - Fixed allocation of page rendering buffers. Previously, some buffers may
    have gone unused or were allocated erroneously to the same position, causing
    unnecessary work for the page renderer.
  - Fixed various issues in the UI layout.
  - Fixed parsing URI scheme (limited set of characters allowed).
  - Don't percent encode equal signs in URL paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 26 18:59:12 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.4
  - Allow server certificates with a *.tld subject wildcard.
  - Updated the French UI translation.
  - Fixed media type check in the audio player. Media types with parameters
    failed to be recognized.
  - Fixed crash after a redirect.
  - Fixed a rare issue with handling multiple rapid network requests.
  - Fixed a rare situation where a network connection would fail to open.
  - Minor stability improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 18 13:04:44 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.3
  - Added UI languages: French, German. (Note that neither is 100% finished
    yet.)
  - Added build option to disable IPC for compatibility reasons.
  - Added environment variable LAGRANGE_OVERRIDE_DPI.
  - Back/forward navigation buttons are disabled if they have no more pages to
    switch to.
  - Minor UI color tuning.
  - Fixed possible crash when closing a tab.
  - Fixed possible crash when restoring application state at launch.
  - Fixed problems parsing and making requests with literal IPv6 addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 11 16:32:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.2
  - Fixed crash after updating from v1.2 due to undefined CA file/path
    configuration.
  - Fixed conflation of pixel ratio and display DPI. Pixel ratio is now always
    separately detected so mouse events can be correctly positioned. You may
    find that adjusting the UI scale factor (Preferences > Interface) is
    necessary after upgrading.
  - Fixed sidebar width changing when moving the window to a different display.
  - Fixed inability to use Tab in keybindings.
  - Fixed opening Gopher URLs via drag-and-drop.
  - Fixed "Add bookmark..." on a feed entry.
  - Fixed keybindings list not being updated immediately when UI language
    changes.
  - Fixed trimming of link label text when a custom Emoji is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fixed issue with overlapped drawing of list bullets vs. list items.
  - Fixed cropped list bullets when using Literata.
  - Fixed whitespace normalization in plain text files (tab characters).
  - Fixed issues buffering window contents, possibly causing missing font glyphs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 18:01:32 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.0
  - Localization
    - Added the first set of UI translations: Chinese (Simplified, Traditional),
      Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. Many thanks to the translators!
    - Added page content translation using a LibreTranslate instance running on
      xlt.skyjake.fi. This is somewhat experimental and may occasionally mess up
      Gemtext markup. Expect long pages to be quite slow to translate (more than
      a minute).
  - Resources
    - Added Noto Sans CJK (Simplified Chinese) font.
    - Added Noto Sans Arabic font. Note that right-to-left/bidirectional text
      rendering is not implemented yet.
    - Added "about:about" that lists all the available "about:" pages.
  - Browsing
    - Alt text is shown when hovering over a preformatted block.
    - Clicking on a preformatted block collapses it, leaving only the alt text.
    - Added option to collapse all preformatted blocks on page load.
    - A server certificate can also be verified by Certificate Authorities. When
      "CA file" and/or "CA path" are set in Preferences, CA verification will
      mark a certificate as trusted.
    - Relaxed TOFU certificate checking when it comes to domain names:
      domain.tld in a certificate is implicitly considered to also mean
      *.domain.tld.
    - Fixed handling of IDNs when the user sets a server certificate as trusted
      via the UI.
    - Fixed handling of unknown URI schemes. Previously they were forcefully
      converted to absolute URIs, breaking them.
  - Page content and rendering
    - Color adjustments to the "Colorful Dark", "Colorful Light", and "Gray"
      themes. "Gray" looks different in dark and light UI modes.
    - Spacing of bullet lists vs. link lists is more consistent.
    - Links are shown in bold, and tinted with the page theme color for more
      coherent appearance.
    - Custom link icons: Gemini links whose destination is on the same domain
      use as icon the Emoji or other pictograph at the start of the link label.
      (For example, see Astrobotany menus.)
    - Added option to wrap lines in plain text files. This is on by default
      because there is no horizontal scrolling for plain text.
    - Large images are downscaled to an appropriate size for presentation.
    - Improved font glyph caching to reduce stuttering during scrolling. All
      required glyphs are cached after a page load finishes. This allows more
      efficient copying of glyphs as the operations can be batched.
    - Larger content buffers for scrolling, reducing need to redraw content.
    - Gopher: Handling the 'h' line type.
    - Fixed minor issues with word wrapping.
    - Fixed minor blending artifacts with the current heading shown on the right
      side of the page.
  - User interface
    - Improved event handling to support touch screens on any platform (if
      supported by SDL).
    - UI scaling factor is applied immediately when closing Preferences.
      Restarting is no longer necessary.
    - Window rescaled automatically when moving it to a display with a different
      DPI.
    - Added unread feed entry count to the sidebar.
    - Added a context menu for toggling sidebars. The menu appears when
      right-clicking on the navbar or on the sidebar tab buttons.
    - Double/triple click selection modes. Double click and drag will select by
      word, triple click by paragraph.
    - Popup menus have icons for items to make it faster to find the item you're
      looking for.
    - Soft shadows for popup menus.
    - Scrollbars fade away on macOS/iOS and dim on other platforms.
    - Reload button moved into the URL field.
    - Narrow URL input fields will not display the default "gemini" scheme.
    - Domain name is highlighted in URL fields.
    - Added a cut/copy/paste context menu to input fields.
    - Added an "Import..." button to the empty Identities sidebar.
    - Preferences dialog was partially reorganized for clarity.
    - Tabs in Preferences look the same as tabs in the sidebar.
    - Cleaner appearance for unread feed items in the sidebar.
    - Dialog buttons show the corresponding shortcut key.
    - Fixed background activity indicators overlapping each other.
    - Fixed glitches when widgets extend beyond the left edge of the window.
    - Fixed use of plurals in UI strings, enabling support for three or more
      plural forms.
  - Keybindings
    - Default page scroll keybindings changed: PageUp/Down scroll a whole page,
      and Space/Shift+Space scrolls half a page. If you're changed these
      bindings, note that they will be reset to defaults.
    - Added keybinding for subscribing to a page.
    - Keyboard modifiers can be remapped using the modmap.txt configuration
      file.
    - Caps Lock can be used as a modifier key.
    - Internet hot keys (if present on a keyboard) can be used to navigate
      back/forward and reload the page.
  - Command line use
    - Added conventional --help, --version options.
    - A previously started instance can be controlled with command line options.
    - --list-tab-urls prints a list of the currently open URLs in the running
      instance.
  - Bug fixes
    - Only one instance of Lagrange is allowed to run per user directory. This
      prevents instances from overwriting each other's data.
    - Fixed use of multiple search terms for quick lookup.
    - Fixed handling of multiple feeds having an entry with the same URL.
    - Fixed percent-decoding of URLs on the command line and coming in via
      system URL handlers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 14 19:11:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.2.3
  - Fixed XML parser hanging on numeric character entities.
  - Fixed "Monospace Body" option causing Gemtext line markup to be visible.

  - CMake: Automatically check if lib/the_Foundation is up-to-date.
  - CMake: Build configuration fails if an SSL library is not found.

- update to 1.2.0
  - New features
    - Atom feed subscriptions: Atom XML documents are automatically converted to
      Gemini feed index pages. This is a built-in version of the Atom-to-Gemini
      example on the Help page.
    - Inline downloads: right-click on any link that is openable inside Lagrange
      and select "Download Linked File".
    - Editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol
      to represent a bookmarked site.
    - Searching via URL field: non-URL text entered in the field is passed onto
      the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is
      shown if a query will take place.
    - Tab auto-reloading: configure a reloading interval using the page context
      menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). Auto-reloading is part of the persistent
      state of the tab.
    - "Iosevka" and "Source Sans Pro" (the UI font) can be used as heading and
      body fonts.
    - User preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
    - Keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode.

      monospace input fields).
    - Added setting for UI accent color (teal, orange).
    - General fine-tuning of the color palette.
    - Dialog buttons are aligned to the right edge, leaving room for additional
      action buttons on the left.
    - Page Information button is embedded in the URL field.
    - Page Information dialog is attached to its button.
    - Site icons use a different color in tab titles for visual distinction.
    - Fade background behind modal dialogs.
    - Responsive page margins.
  - Other changes
    - Help is opened on first run instead of the "About Lagrange" page to make
      it easier to discover important Gemini links like the FAQ.
    - "Go to Root" respects a user name found in the URL. One can still "Go to
      Parent" to get above the user level.
    - Feed entries are sorted by refresh time if they are published on the same
      date.
    - Don't show future-dated feed entries in Feeds.
    - Middle-clicking on links: open new tab in background or foreground
      depending on the Shift key.
