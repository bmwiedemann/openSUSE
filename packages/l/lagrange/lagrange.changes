Wed Sep  1 19:32:57 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.5
  - Audio init errors are no longer fatal. SDL's error message will still be
    printed.
  - Fixed appearance of tab buttons (should have no top frame).
  - Fixed a cursor position regression in input fields related to handling of
    variation selectors (codepoint clusters). Moving the cursor to the start of
    a wrapped line segment put the cursor in the wrong place.
  - Fixed right-clicking on sidebar tab buttons. It was showing the wrong
    context menu when the list had been scrolled down.
  - Fixed crash when using the SDL2 KMSDRM video driver.
  - Fixed minor visual artifacts in preformatted blocks and near the bottom of
    the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 22 09:27:19 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.4
  - Local files containing UTF-8 text can be viewed regardless of their file
    extension.
  - Fixed input field cursor positioning and insertion problems around Emoji
    variation selectors.
  - Fixed "Unknown Status Code" shown in Page Information for valid status
    codes.
  - Fixed an issue with network requests that would make it appear the server
    was not responding, but the request would not time out.
  - Fixed a potential invalid memory access when clicking on sidebar items.
  - OpenBSD: Fixed a freeze after a network request is cancelled.
  - Fixed page contents not reflowing during a window resize.
  - Added build option ENABLE_RESIZE_DRAW. SDL doesn't redraw window contents on
    all platforms during resizing, so this can be used to force it.
- Removed patch lagrange-1.6.3-Updated-AppData.patch. Applied upstream.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 15 11:46:07 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jul 27 09:31:51 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.6.0
  - warning A new TOFU trust store will be created. The old one is kept around
    but ignored.
  - warning App state serialization format has been updated. Downgrading to a
    previous release will cause app state to be reset (e.g., tabs closed,
    navigation history cleared).
  - warning New build dependencies: HarfBuzz and GNU FriBidi (see README).
  - New features:
    - Added support for bidirectional text and complex scripts. العالم متنوع
    - Right-to-left paragraphs are aligned to the right. Link icons and
      list/quote symbols are moved to the right margin.
    - Added support for Titan uploads. The data to upload can be entered via a
      text field or by dropping a file on the window.
    - Added a keybinding for opening the current page URL in the upload dialog
      (Ctrl+U). This simply switches the page's URL scheme from gemini to titan.
    - Added a configuration file for defining the UI color palette (see Help,
      section 3.5).
    - Added settings for keyboard and mouse scrolling speeds.
    - Added setting for changing Return key behavior in input fields (line break
      vs. accept).
    - Added setting for adjusting line spacing.
    - Added link context menu item for deleting local files (e.g., downloads).
  - Changes and enhancements:
    - Improved TOFU: if the server certificate is not trusted, the connection is
      aborted at the TLS handshake stage. Previously, only a warning was shown
      and the page contents were fetched regardless.
    - Server certificate fingerprints are generated based on public keys, which
      allows servers to renew their certificates without losing trusted status.
    - Improved handling of expired server certificates. An error page is shown
      and the connection is aborted at the TLS handshake stage. The user can
      give a temporary exception to load the page.
    - Page contents are cached in presentation form for quicker restoring during
      back/forward navigation.
    - Inline images/audio will not get discarded during back/forward navigation.
      The Network > Memory Size setting determines the maximum memory usage for
      media. Setting the Memory Size to zero is equivalent to the previous
      behavior of discarding everything when the page changes.
    - Debug information includes RAM use in addition to cache size. This
      includes document layout and media stored in memory (e.g., raw pixel data
      of images).
    - Text input fields support larger amounts of content and expand vertically
      only up to a limit, after which they start scrolling.
    - Preferences have been reorganized. There is a new Fonts tab, and some
      General settings have been moved to the Style tab. All color-related
      settings are on the Colors tab, including UI theme colors.
    - Links opened on a page are updated to reflect visited status even when
      opening into a background tab or to the side.
    - Unicode Byte Order Mark is ignored in the beginning of a page.
    - Updated Smol Emoji with new characters.
    - Query/Feeds indicators have a smaller appearance in a narrow window to
      leave room for the URL.
  - Fixes:
    - Large lede paragraph font is not applied if the paragraph has too many
      lines.
    - Fixed minor kerning issues when using Nunito.
    - Fixed sizing of characters in the Noto Symbols fonts.
    - Improved internal handling of URLs. For example, some URLs were not being
      recognized as visited because of percent-encoding differences.
    - Fixed URL in the generated page for viewing a single image (spaces weren't
      encoded).
    - Input dialog is not dismissed unless the Cancel button is clicked or
      Escape is pressed.
    - Workaround for a potential hang during the closing of a socket.
    - TLS client certificates generated by the app have identical issuer and
      subject fields, including all the provided information and not just the
      Common Name.
    - Gopher: Improved detection of ASCII art.
    - Gopher: Show contents of unrecognized line types.
    - Gopher: Don't collapse preformatted blocks since everything is
      preformatted in the source.
    - Gopher: All preformatted blocks are unindented to avoid misaligned ASCII
      art.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 16 15:50:08 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.2
  - Fixed pasting a PEM-formatted certificate and/or private key via clipboard
    in Import Identity.
  - Possible workaround for a visual glitch in the URL field.
  - Specify StartupWMClass in .desktop file.
  - Normalize page contents to avoid the most common issues with diacritics
    (Unicode NFC).
  - Expanded the set of recognized custom link icons.
  - Updated "Smol Emoji" font with new glyphs.
  - Allow use of TLS cipher "DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jun  6 14:41:51 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.1
  - Updated UI translations.
  - Updated "Smol Emoji" font with new and improved glyphs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 30 18:22:14 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.5.0
  - Added "Smol Emoji" and "Noto Sans Symbols" fonts, removed Symbola.
  - warning Many Emoji and pictographs defined in the last five years are
    currently missing.
  - Added document footer buttons: on certain pages (e.g., error messages) show
    relevant actions in the bottom of the page. For example, if a certificate is
    required for viewing a page, show buttons for creating a new identity and
    showing the Identities sidebar.
  - Error pages include the human-readable text sent by the server.
  - Disregard old feed entries whose unread status would have been forgotten.
  - Added UI language: Polish.
  - Identity management:
      - Revised New Identity dialog. An option is provided to automatically use
        the new identity on the current domain/page. The additional fields are
        hidden by default.
      - Improved usability of Identities sidebar. No more accidental
        activations: left-clicking an identity opens the context menu without
        making any changes. The context menu shows each active URL as a menu
        item for easy access. Identity icons reflect the usage status: all
        identities used on the current domain get highlighted in addition to the
        currently used one.
      - Identities can be exported: certificate and private key are opened in a
        new tab in plain text PEM format.
      - Fixed issues with identity usage: a higher-up URL overrides and
        deactivates all contained URLs to avoid redundant activation.
  - Text input:
      - Revised text input widgets: added support for multiple lines, and when
        entering user response to a query, show how many bytes are remaining for
        the response URL about to be submitted. In dialogs, input fields expand
        vertically instead of scrolling their content horizontally.
      - Input widgets allow inserting newlines using Shift+Return.
      - Disallow sending query responses that are too long (1024 bytes maximum).
      - Shift-click to select a range of text in input widgets (i.e, without
        dragging).
  - Rendering:
      - Animate showing and hiding of sidebars and dialogs. Animations are
        enabled by default, by can be disabled with Preferences > Interface >
        Animations.
      - Added setting for a custom TrueType symbol font for any missing
        characters. Note: Must be a .TTF file — OpenType and bitmap fonts are
        not supported.
      - Link navigation shortcut icons (home row and numbered) are drawn with a
        consistent appearance.
      - Improved icon alignment in lists.
      - Reduced line gap between word-wrapped top-level headings.
      - Modal dialog background dimming fades in/out smoothly.
  - Split view:
      - Added keybindings for split view menu items.
      - Changed default split view keys to conform to Emacs (3 for horizontal, 2
        for vertical split).
      - Fixes and improvements for touch screen event handling in split view
        mode.
  - Command line:
      - Added --url-or-search (-u) command line option. Depending on the
        parameter, either open an URL or make a search query.
      - Open all URLs/files specified on the command line in new tabs, and raise
        the window if the app is already running. (Kudos to Alyssa Rosenzweig.)
  - Gempub:
      - Linear navigation through the book with Left/Right arrow keys and via
        footer buttons. The navigation order is determined by links on the
        Gempub index page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May 22 10:29:52 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.2
  - Fixed UI colors being all black on the first run.
  - Fixed right mouse click on an inactive split not having any effect.
  - Fixed action buttons showing under the Help link in an empty Identities
    sidebar.
  - Fixed potential crash at shutdown.
  - Fixed minor UI layout issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 13 15:50:59 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.1
  - Fixed removing the left side split by closing all its tabs. The URL input
    field got confused about which tab was currently open, and the wrong theme
    was active.
  - Fixed tab merging when unsplitting the window: keep the currently active tab
    open.
  - Fixed issue with sidebars sometimes becoming unresponsive.
  - Fixed font used for visited monospace Gopher links.
  - Fixed incorrectly shown/hidden ◧ indicator.
  - Fixed scrollbar in Preferences > Keys being hidden until the list is
    scrolled.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri May  7 19:09:26 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.4.0
  - Added split view modes: two tabs at once, horizontal/vertical split,
    1:1/2:1/1:2 weights, merge tabs, swap sides. See section 1.8 in Help for
    details.
  - Split view pinning: keep a page pinned on one side while all opened links go
    to the other side.
  - "file://" URLs can be used for viewing contents of local directories and ZIP
    archives.
  - Basic Gempub support: a cover page is generated based on metadata, and
    there's an automatic split view for index and contents. On macOS, Lagrange
    is registered as a viewer of .gpub files.
  - Bold link styling is used for indicating which links are unvisited.
  - Page rendering was optimized: now each line of text is rendered into the
    view buffer only once, and whenever the view is stationary, content is
    prefilled in the available space outside the viewport. Previously, at least
    one line of text was rendered every frame when the viewport was moving,
    which was mostly redundant.
  - Added UI languages: Interlingua, Toki Pona.
  - Added "New"/"Import" buttons in the bottom of the Identities tab.
  - Added an "All"/"Unread" mode switch in the bottom of the Feeds tab.
  - Added toggles for special tags in the bookmark creation/editor dialog.
  - Added "Show Downloads" to the File/main menu.
  - Added "Open Downloaded File" to the file save dialog to make it easy to find
    the local copy of the file.
  - Updated the UI font to Source Sans 3. It now has all the styles and weights
    needed for page rendering, too.
  - Added a semibold Fira Sans weight (used for unvisited links).
  - Preferences: Reorganized the fonts dropdown menu.
  - Changed popup dismiss behavior so that a click outside just dismisses the
    popup and does not trigger further actions.
  - All lists support smooth scrolling.
  - Multitouch scrolling: each finger can scroll a different widget.
  - Adjustments to how display DPI affects UI scaling.
  - Fixed allocation of page rendering buffers. Previously, some buffers may
    have gone unused or were allocated erroneously to the same position, causing
    unnecessary work for the page renderer.
  - Fixed various issues in the UI layout.
  - Fixed parsing URI scheme (limited set of characters allowed).
  - Don't percent encode equal signs in URL paths.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr 26 18:59:12 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.4

  - Added environment variable LAGRANGE_OVERRIDE_DPI.
  - Back/forward navigation buttons are disabled if they have no more pages to
    switch to.
  - Minor UI color tuning.
  - Fixed possible crash when closing a tab.
  - Fixed possible crash when restoring application state at launch.
  - Fixed problems parsing and making requests with literal IPv6 addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Apr 11 16:32:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.2
  - Fixed crash after updating from v1.2 due to undefined CA file/path
    configuration.
  - Fixed conflation of pixel ratio and display DPI. Pixel ratio is now always
    separately detected so mouse events can be correctly positioned. You may
    find that adjusting the UI scale factor (Preferences > Interface) is
    necessary after upgrading.
  - Fixed sidebar width changing when moving the window to a different display.
  - Fixed inability to use Tab in keybindings.
  - Fixed opening Gopher URLs via drag-and-drop.
  - Fixed "Add bookmark..." on a feed entry.
  - Fixed keybindings list not being updated immediately when UI language
    changes.
  - Fixed trimming of link label text when a custom Emoji is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fixed issue with overlapped drawing of list bullets vs. list items.
  - Fixed cropped list bullets when using Literata.
  - Fixed whitespace normalization in plain text files (tab characters).
  - Fixed issues buffering window contents, possibly causing missing font glyphs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar 31 18:01:32 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.3.0
  - Localization
    - Added the first set of UI translations: Chinese (Simplified, Traditional),
      Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. Many thanks to the translators!
    - Added page content translation using a LibreTranslate instance running on
      xlt.skyjake.fi. This is somewhat experimental and may occasionally mess up
      Gemtext markup. Expect long pages to be quite slow to translate (more than
      a minute).
  - Resources
    - Added Noto Sans CJK (Simplified Chinese) font.
    - Added Noto Sans Arabic font. Note that right-to-left/bidirectional text
      rendering is not implemented yet.
    - Added "about:about" that lists all the available "about:" pages.
  - Browsing
    - Alt text is shown when hovering over a preformatted block.
    - Clicking on a preformatted block collapses it, leaving only the alt text.
    - Added option to collapse all preformatted blocks on page load.
    - A server certificate can also be verified by Certificate Authorities. When
      "CA file" and/or "CA path" are set in Preferences, CA verification will
      mark a certificate as trusted.
    - Relaxed TOFU certificate checking when it comes to domain names:
      domain.tld in a certificate is implicitly considered to also mean
      *.domain.tld.
    - Fixed handling of IDNs when the user sets a server certificate as trusted
      via the UI.
    - Fixed handling of unknown URI schemes. Previously they were forcefully
      converted to absolute URIs, breaking them.
  - Page content and rendering
    - Color adjustments to the "Colorful Dark", "Colorful Light", and "Gray"
      themes. "Gray" looks different in dark and light UI modes.
    - Spacing of bullet lists vs. link lists is more consistent.
    - Links are shown in bold, and tinted with the page theme color for more
      coherent appearance.
    - Custom link icons: Gemini links whose destination is on the same domain
      use as icon the Emoji or other pictograph at the start of the link label.
      (For example, see Astrobotany menus.)
    - Added option to wrap lines in plain text files. This is on by default
      because there is no horizontal scrolling for plain text.
    - Large images are downscaled to an appropriate size for presentation.
    - Improved font glyph caching to reduce stuttering during scrolling. All
      required glyphs are cached after a page load finishes. This allows more
      efficient copying of glyphs as the operations can be batched.
    - Larger content buffers for scrolling, reducing need to redraw content.
    - Gopher: Handling the 'h' line type.
    - Fixed minor issues with word wrapping.
    - Fixed minor blending artifacts with the current heading shown on the right
      side of the page.
  - User interface
    - Improved event handling to support touch screens on any platform (if
      supported by SDL).
    - UI scaling factor is applied immediately when closing Preferences.
      Restarting is no longer necessary.
    - Window rescaled automatically when moving it to a display with a different
      DPI.
    - Added unread feed entry count to the sidebar.
    - Added a context menu for toggling sidebars. The menu appears when
      right-clicking on the navbar or on the sidebar tab buttons.
    - Double/triple click selection modes. Double click and drag will select by
      word, triple click by paragraph.
    - Popup menus have icons for items to make it faster to find the item you're
      looking for.
    - Soft shadows for popup menus.
    - Scrollbars fade away on macOS/iOS and dim on other platforms.
    - Reload button moved into the URL field.
    - Narrow URL input fields will not display the default "gemini" scheme.
    - Domain name is highlighted in URL fields.
    - Added a cut/copy/paste context menu to input fields.
    - Added an "Import..." button to the empty Identities sidebar.
    - Preferences dialog was partially reorganized for clarity.
    - Tabs in Preferences look the same as tabs in the sidebar.
    - Cleaner appearance for unread feed items in the sidebar.
    - Dialog buttons show the corresponding shortcut key.
    - Fixed background activity indicators overlapping each other.
    - Fixed glitches when widgets extend beyond the left edge of the window.
    - Fixed use of plurals in UI strings, enabling support for three or more
      plural forms.
  - Keybindings
    - Default page scroll keybindings changed: PageUp/Down scroll a whole page,
      and Space/Shift+Space scrolls half a page. If you're changed these
      bindings, note that they will be reset to defaults.
    - Added keybinding for subscribing to a page.
    - Keyboard modifiers can be remapped using the modmap.txt configuration
      file.
    - Caps Lock can be used as a modifier key.
    - Internet hot keys (if present on a keyboard) can be used to navigate
      back/forward and reload the page.
  - Command line use
    - Added conventional --help, --version options.
    - A previously started instance can be controlled with command line options.
    - --list-tab-urls prints a list of the currently open URLs in the running
      instance.
  - Bug fixes
    - Only one instance of Lagrange is allowed to run per user directory. This
      prevents instances from overwriting each other's data.
    - Fixed use of multiple search terms for quick lookup.
    - Fixed handling of multiple feeds having an entry with the same URL.
    - Fixed percent-decoding of URLs on the command line and coming in via
      system URL handlers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar 14 19:11:47 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.2.3
  - Fixed XML parser hanging on numeric character entities.
  - Fixed "Monospace Body" option causing Gemtext line markup to be visible.
  - Fixed bookmarking a wrapped link. Now the entire label text gets used
    instead of just the clicked segment.
  - Fixed handling of non-advancing monospace glyphs.
  - CMake: Automatically check if lib/the_Foundation is up-to-date.
  - CMake: Build configuration fails if an SSL library is not found.
  - Reverted default bookmarks having "Getting Started" as a remote bookmark
    source. Now it's just a regular bookmark.

Sat Feb 27 15:02:24 UTC 2021 - Adam Mizerski <adam@mizerski.pl>

- update to 1.2.0
  - New features
    - Atom feed subscriptions: Atom XML documents are automatically converted to
      Gemini feed index pages. This is a built-in version of the Atom-to-Gemini
      example on the Help page.
    - Inline downloads: right-click on any link that is openable inside Lagrange
      and select "Download Linked File".
    - Editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol
      to represent a bookmarked site.
    - Searching via URL field: non-URL text entered in the field is passed onto
      the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is
      shown if a query will take place.
    - Tab auto-reloading: configure a reloading interval using the page context
      menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). Auto-reloading is part of the persistent
      state of the tab.
    - "Iosevka" and "Source Sans Pro" (the UI font) can be used as heading and
      body fonts.
    - User preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
    - Keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode.
    - Keybinding for finding text on page.
  - UI design

      titles have less pronounced borders.
    - Improved sidebar appearance: bold subheadings, larger feed icons, adjusted
      spacing, background color.
    - Font consistency: all UI elements use the same font (i.e., no more
      monospace input fields).
