  <title>Mail Digests of System Log Files to the System Administrator</title>
  <description>Logdigest, run by cron at night, greps through system log files
(var/log/messages, /var/log/mail, etc.) to find &quot;interesting&quot; content.

Lines matching the regular expressions in /etc/logdigest are simply
ignored. More expressions can be added to /etc/logdigest/ignore.local.
See /etc/logdigest/config for some general settings.

The results are mailed to the sysadmin daily.</description>
