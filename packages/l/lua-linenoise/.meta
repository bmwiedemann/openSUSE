  <title>Lua binding for the linenoise command line library</title>
  <description>Linenoise (https://github.com/antirez/linenoise) is a delightfully
simple command line library. This Lua module is simply a binding for it.

The main Linenoise upstream has stagnated a bit, so this binding tracks
https://github.com/yhirose/linenoise/tree/utf8-support, which includes
things like UTF-8 support and ANSI terminal escape sequence detection.</description>
