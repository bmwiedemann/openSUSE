  <title>Powerful, Multilingual File Viewer, Same User Interface as &quot;Less&quot;</title>
  <description>Lv is a powerful, multilingual file viewer. Apparently, lv looks like
less (1), a representative file viewer on UNIX, so UNIX people (and
less people on other OSs) do not have to learn a burdensome new
interface.

Lv can decode and encode multilingual streams through many coding
systems. Lv can be used as a coding system translation filter.

Lv can recognize multibyte patterns as regular expressions, and
provides multilingual grep (1) functionality under the name lgrep.

Lv can recognize ANSI escape sequences for text decoration.</description>
