  <title>Fix Broken lzip Files</title>
  <description>Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the lzip
compressed data format (.lz) able to repair slightly damaged files, recover
badly damaged files from two or more copies, extract undamaged members from
multi-member files, decompress files and test integrity of files.

Lziprecover is able to recover or decompress files produced by any of the
compressors in the lzip family; lzip, plzip, minilzip/lzlib, clzip and pdlzip.
This recovery capability contributes to make the lzip format one of the best
options for long-term data archiving.

Lziprecover is able to efficiently extract a range of bytes from a multi-member
file, because it only decompresses the members containing the desired data.

Lziprecover can print correct total file sizes and ratios even for multi-member
files.
