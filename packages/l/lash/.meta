  <title>Linux Audio Session Handler</title>
  <description>LASH (formerly LADCCA) is a session management system for JACK and ALSA
audio applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have many
different audio programs running at once and to save the setup, close
them down, then reload the setup at some other time.
