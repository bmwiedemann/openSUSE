    <comment>- Update to version 10.0.1.
  * This release contains bug-fixes for the LLVM 10.0.0 release.
    This release is API and ABI compatible with 10.0.0.
- Rebase llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch.
- Replace ValueLattice-Add-new-state-for-undef-constants.patch,
  which landed upstream in a modified version, by
  restore-llvm10-abi.patch that resets the ABI to our 10.0.0.
- Rewrite lld-default-sha1.patch to be version-independent.
- Set flags consistently, so that we don't lose -DNDEBUG on 32-bit
  architectures. Also we don't need the opt flags twice. This leads
  to a significant reduction in binary sizes on 32-bit arches.
- Make it easier to package release candidates.
- Enable most tests on 32-bit ARM, but not for libcxx.
- Add fix-atomics-test.patch for architectures where native atomics
  are not available.
- Lower build constraints for riscv64 a bit to allow building on
  more workers.
- Allow more compile jobs in stage 2.
- Factor out computation of the number of jobs into a macro.
- Choose mem_per_compile_job dependent on build stage, let stage 1
  on x86_64 use more memory.
- More generous memory allocation on riscv64.
- Add lld-default-sha1.patch to make lld generate SHA1 build-ids by
  default, otherwise our tools cannot process the debuginfo.
- Update to version 10.0.0.

    - https://releases.llvm.org/10.0.0/tools/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.html
  * New LLVM tools: llvm-ifs, llvm-install-name-tool, llvm-reduce.
  * New Clang tools: clang-move, clang-offload-wrapper, pp-trace.
  * lldb-mi moved to a separate project and is no longer available.
- Dropped obsolete patches:
  * clang-fix-powerpc-triplet.patch
  * clang-riscv64-rv64gc.diff
  * compiler-rt-move-fdp.patch
  * compiler-rt-sanitizer-ipc-perm.patch
  * D60657-riscv-pcrel_lo.diff
  * gwp-asan-lto.patch
  * libcxx-tests-linux-distribution.patch
  * link-lldb-shared.patch
  * llvm-riscv64-fix-cffi.diff
  * openmp-export-fini.patch
  * riscv-eh-frame-fixup.patch
  * riscv64-suse-linux.patch
- Rebased patches:
  * assume-opensuse.patch
  * link-clang-tools-extra-shared.patch
  * lldb-cmake.patch
  * llvm_build_tablegen_component_as_shared_library.patch
  * llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch
  * llvm-remove-clang-only-flags.patch
  * lto-disable-cache.patch
  * polly-pthread.patch
  * tests-use-python3.patch
- Add tablegen-test-link-static.patch: fix TableGenTests.
- Add ValueLattice-Add-new-state-for-undef-constants.patch: fix
  miscompilation on ppc64/s390x that was leading to test crashes.
- Enable ThinLTO on aarch64.
- Disable ThinLTO on ppc64le due to internal error in gold.
- Delete object files and static libraries from build tree in
  %install already, because debuginfo extraction happens after
  that. If we do it after %check, we run out of disk space.
- Run tests &quot;manually&quot;, because we've already removed many targets.
- Don't build unit tests, because some of them are now statically
  linked, which is very expensive with LTO. Also unit tests are
  probably not very interesting on the distribution level, we don't
  expect them to perform different than in upstream. The relevant
  upstream change for this is https://reviews.llvm.org/D54439.
- Drop %if for openSUSE 13.2.
- Remove conflicts of clang-tools with {clang,llvm}{7,8}: the
  relevant binaries have been removed from those packages. This
  allows having clang-tools together with older versions of llvm.
  For a smooth installation we add OrderWithRequires dependencies.
- Fix typos in (still inactive) !%{with clang_scripts} part.
- Require clang-tools for clangX-devel.
- Move all clang-related scripts (including those originally in
  clangX-checker), hmaptool and clang-doc into a common
  unversioned subpackage clang-tools, like python3-clang.
  The scripts reference the unversioned executables, so allowing
  multiple versions via update-alternatives would be misleading.
  The clang-doc executable will come with assets in Clang 10, so
  we have to take it out of update-alternatives as well.
  This should be the proper solution to boo#1161873.
- Include run-find-all-symbols script in clang-tools.
- Remove metadata for clangX-include-fixer subpackage that never
  had any files and thus wasn't released as rpm. There are so many
  clang binaries that packaging them separately doesn't scale.
- Fix lldb version string, adapt lldb-cmake.patch (boo#1165517).
- Remove unneccesary libtool dependency.
- Don't let clang depend on libc++, we link it with libstdc++.
- Recommend gold plugin if clang and gold are installed.
- Add vim-plugin-llvm Conflicts to clang subpackage which now
  contains files formerly in llvmN-vim-plugins, conflicting with
  packages from older llvm releases.
- Add back emacs-llvm Provides and Conflicts to clang subpackage
  originally in llvm-emacs-plugins to properly conflict with
  llvm-emacs-plugins from older llvm releases.
- Add clang5-devel to clang9-doc conflicts.
- Add compiler-rt-sanitizer-ipc-perm.patch: Fix sanitizer-common
  build with glibc 2.31.
- Move clang-{format,include-fixer,rename}.{el,py} files from
  llvm-*-plugins to clang package. (boo#1161873)
- Drop the now empty llvm-emacs-plugins package.
- Add polly and lld build conditionals, remove excessive Requires
  to clang from docs.  Fix conditional for libc++ use.
  [jsc#SLE-7400, jsc#SLE-7614, jsc#SLE-7452, jsc#SLE-8920, jsc#SLE-7390,
   jsc#SLE-7587]
- Undo spec-cleaner changes that we don't want.
  * Reintroduce blank lines in configuration.
  * Use packageand syntax that works for older versions of RPM.
  * Don't use %{_bindir} on left-hand side of sed replacements.
- riscv-eh-frame-fixup.patch: Remove changesets that alter the libLLVM ABI
- Add upstream patch to export compiler-rt FuzzedDataProvider header, 
  required by Envoy 1.12.2:
  * compiler-rt-move-fdp.patch 
- riscv-eh-frame-fixup.patch: Fix handling of .eh_frame on RISC-V
- polly-pthread.patch: Add missing -lpthread
- Enable support for riscv64
- clang-riscv64-rv64gc.diff, riscv64-suse-linux.patch,
  llvm-riscv64-fix-cffi.diff, D60657-riscv-pcrel_lo.diff: Backports from
  master
- Update to version 9.0.1.
  * This release contains bug-fixes for the LLVM 9.0.0 release.
    This release is API and ABI compatible with 9.0.0.
- Drop patches that have landed upstream:
  * dont-install-example-analyzer-plugins.patch
  * fix-module-test.patch
  * llvm-add-missing-include.patch
- Drop set-revision.patch, don't provide revision number in clang.
  The upstream repository has moved from Subversion to git, so the
  revision number is just a hash, which limits its usefulness.
- Rebase llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch.
- Modify libcxx-tests-linux-distribution.patch to remove dependency
  on python-distro again: we don't have expected failures.
- Add llvm-add-missing-include.patch in order to fix
  boo#1158367.
- Add gwp-asan-lto.patch: Make sure there are no LLVM IR files in
  static libraries that we package.
- Add libcxx-tests-linux-distribution.patch (boo#1158293):
  Replace platform.linux_distribution by distro.linux_distribution.
- Make documentation packages noarch.
- Add openmp-export-fini.patch: Export termination function for
  libomp.so, solves boo#1155108.
- Remove flaky test case in libcxx.
- Fix typo, BOLL -&gt; BOOL
- Let new {llvm,clang}*-doc packages &quot;Conflict&quot; with older devel
  packages, which they were split from.
- Let doc packages conflict with older versions of themselves.
- (Build)Require only python3-base instead of full python3 package,
  the additional modules are not required. Helps shortening the
  build dependency chain.
- Remove python3-* requires from lldb9 subpackage, and add it to
  the bindings/pretty-printer subpackage (python3-lldb9).
- Add python3-base Requires to python3-clang subpackage
- Add dont-install-example-analyzer-plugins.patch: Remove example
  analyzer plugins from install targets instead of deleting them.
- Add fix-module-test.patch: fix test instead of deleting it.
- Don't build static libc++ (with ThinLTO that's not useful anyway).
- Don't build libc++experimental.
- Don't package libc++abi.so with libc++-devel, it's already contained
  in the (required) libc++abi-devel.
- Be more specific about files in libc++-devel.
- Update to version 9.0.0.

    - https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.html
- Change License to &quot;Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception OR NCSA&quot;.
  (https://llvm.org/foundation/relicensing/)
- Allow building with ThinLTO and enable it on some architectures.
- Disable LTO cache in lto-disable-cache.patch.
- Unset MALLOC_CHECK_ for compilation to mitigate lock contention.
- No debug info for ppc like for the other 32-bit targets.
- Clean up _constraints: same constraints for 32-bit targets.
- Don't use BUILD_SHARED_LIBS for Clang anymore, since the newly
  available libclang-cpp.so should expose the full C++ API.
- Link tools with libclang-cpp.so by using CLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB,
  similar to LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB for libLLVM.so.
- Remove obsolete n_clang_allow_BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY.patch.
- Add link-clang-shared.patch to link more clang targets with
  libclang-cpp.so, especially libclang.so.
- Add link-clang-tools-extra-shared.patch, link-lldb-shared.patch:
  link targets in clang-tools-extra and lldb with libclang-cpp.so.
- Simplify llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch, also handle
  Clang, for which we now get static libraries.
- Package documentation for llvm and clang separately, recommend
  them for the main package: they are not required for development,
  but actually useful for working with the non-devel packages.
- Recommend editor plugins not just for llvm-devel.
- Recommend libstdc++ for Clang again.
- Move diagtool from llvm to clang subpackage.
- Properly distinguish between %{_relver} and %{version}.
- Drop aarch64-disable-memorytest.patch and reactivate test.
- Rebase clang-resourcedirs.patch.
- Rebase llvm-normally-versioned-libllvm.patch.
- Rebase llvm-remove-clang-only-flags.patch.
- Rebase llvm_build_tablegen_component_as_shared_library.patch.
- Rebase set-revision.patch.
- Increase disk space for build.
- Make lldb recommend python3-lldb (it contains pretty printers).
- Use python3 shebangs everywhere (boo#1146533).
- Drop obsolete opt-viewer-Do-not-require-python-2.patch.
- Remove unneccesary dependencies:
  * groff, bison and flex don't seem to be used.
  * jsoncpp is no longer used since r338461.
  * Move some BuildRequires to subpackages.
  * Don't recommend scan-{build,view} in clang (boo#1145444).
  * Devel packages are only required in other devel packages,
    when their headers are included in the installed headers.
- Add versions to Provides/Conflicts except for files.
- Remove unused (since r268685) CMake flags LLVM_ENABLE_TIMESTAMPS.
- Fix installation of opt-viewer files when python3-clang is no
  longer built.
- Update to version 8.0.1.
  * This release contains bug-fixes for the LLVM 8.0.0 release.
    This release is API and ABI compatible with 8.0.0.
- Don't run LLVM tests on ppc at all because of sporadic hangs.
- Increase RAM for armv6/7 to avoid OOM and be scheduled on fast
  worker
- Use the documented LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI to enable RTTI instead of
  LLVM_REQUIRES_RTTI, which &quot;is an internal flag that individual
  targets can use to force RTTI&quot;. (boo#1139584)
- Drop obsolete llvm-build-tests-with-rtti.patch.
- Exclude riscv64 for now since it fails to build.
- Change some groups:
  * put libraries in System/Libraries,
  * devel packages in Development/Libraries,
  * clang in Development/Languages/C and C++,
  * the gold plugin in Development/Tools/Building.
- Add some URLs, use https:// when possible.
- Remove unneeded devel dependencies.
- Only suggest a C++ standard library for clang. It's also a
  C compiler and needs no C++ library when only used as such.
- Fix Supplements for editor plugins.
- Fix some rpmlint issues:
  * Reword summary and description for Polly.
  * Fix /usr/bin/env shebangs.
  * Remove executable bit where not needed.
  * Move bash completion to /usr.
  * Remove hard dependency of libclang8 to libstdc++-devel.
- Make rpm macros work properly.
- Remove sources from documentation.
- Run %fdupes on the right directories.
- Enable tests for libcxx.
- Reduce memory requirements for compile jobs depending on arch.
- Avoid relocation overflow on ppc by not building GPU backends.
- Update baselibs.conf.
- Disable LTO (boo#1133254).
- Fix packaging on ppc: the sanitizers aren't available there, so
  the directories /usr/lib/clang/*/{lib,share} are missing.
- Package LLVMgold even when we don't use gold for linking.
  It's promised in /usr/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMExports.cmake.
- Unignore test failures on PowerPC64 architectures. The failures
  in ppc are unrelated to AMDGPU, so we remove that remark.
- Fix dependencies: the gold plugin shouldn't depend on llvm-devel.
  libc++abi-devel should depend on libc++abi.
- Fix typo.
- Enable libc++ on ARM (Needed for tensorflow)
- Update to 8.0.0

  llvm-Ensure-that-variant-part-discriminator-is-read-by-Me.patch,
  llvm-test-Fix-Assembler-debug-info.ll.patch
  * Already included upstream
- Add 0001-CMake-Add-install-targets-for-utilities-to-LLVM-expo.patch
- Remove -fno-strict-aliasing, which upstream doesn't use any more
  since r245304 in 2015. (http://reviews.llvm.org/D12036)
  It's probably also not needed for modern versions of GCC.
  It was enabled in r105644 because of some bugs there.
- Add a clang-%{_sonum} symlink, which is referenced by
  /usr/lib64/cmake/clang/ClangTargets.cmake (boo#1120098)
- Package clang builtin headers with libclang. The library is
  basically unusable without the builtin headers. Currently
  consumers of libclang have to require clang as well, although
  only the headers are needed.
- llvm-Ensure-that-variant-part-discriminator-is-read-by-Me.patch,
  llvm-test-Fix-Assembler-debug-info.ll.patch
  * Fix crash in rustc (boo#1126907)

  * PowerPC;AMDGPU;BPF;NVPTX
- Ignore testsuite failures on ppc
- llvm-drop-llvm-optional-clang-specific-optimization.patch
  * Fix ABI incompatibility when libLLVM (built with clang) is
    linked to a program build with gcc. (boo#1119092)
- opt-viewer-Find-style-css-in-usr-share.patch
  * Make sure opt-viewer installed in /usr/bin can find resources
    from /usr/share/opt-viewer. (boo#1112730)
- llvm-unittests-Don-t-install-TestPlugin.so.patch
  * It is only used for testing and is causing failures when
    processing LLVMExports.cmake.
- Update to llvm 7.0.0
  * For details, see the release notes:

  * Fixes build on i586.
- Updated llvm-remove-clang-only-flags.patch
  - Exclude also &quot;-Werror=unguarded-availability-new&quot; (bsc#1106000)
- Update to llvm 6.0.1

- Add lldb-fix-build-with-python-3.7.patch
  * Fix build with python 3.7
- llvm6-fix-gdb-index-crash.patch
  * From upstream, fix lld --gdb-index crash.
- Do not requires gcc6 for older sle versions.
  * llvm6 is not built on &lt;= 12 SP3 and this was preventing build
    on 12 SP4.
- llvm_build_tablegen_component_as_shared_library.patch
  * Build TableGen component as its own shared library because it
    is not included in the libLLVM library and is needed for ldc.
    (bsc#1086445)
- Add patch llvm6-fix-InstCombine.patch to fix InstCombine init
  * Will be fixed in 6.0.1 release
- Do not build stage1 with debug info. It was accidentally added
  with the use of %optflags. This should fix out of memory errors
  on 32bit architectures and speed up build everywhere else.
  (bsc#1092697)
- llvm-build-tests-with-rtti.patch
  * Fixes build failure with gcc 8. (bnc#1087136)
- Do not export Polly static libraries which we do not distribute.
  * Updated llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch
- Use external jsoncpp instead of the bundled one.
  * Added polly-cmake-Trust-pkg-config-in-FindJsoncpp.patch
- llvm6-devel must require llvm6-polly-devel
  * Files in llvm6-devel reference Polly.
- Update to llvm 6.0.0
  * Added polly
  * Notable changes:
    - Retpoline Spectre variant 2 mitigation
    - GlobalISel by default for AArch64 at -O0
    - improved scheduling on several x86 micro-architectures
    - Clang defaults to -std=gnu++14 instead of -std=gnu++98
    - support for some upcoming C++2a features
    - improved optimizations, new compiler warnings, many bug
      fixes, and more.
- Use alternatives for clang's bash autocomplete to prevent
  conflicts with other versions.
- Remove liblldb5 and lldb5-devel from baselibs.conf. They are only
  build for x86_64, so no point having them in baselibs.conf.
- Use %optflags, except for FORTIFY_SOURCE which is not compatible
  with compiler-rt.
- Exclude static libraries differently.
  * Drop llvm-split-static-library-exports-into-their-own-export-file.diff
  * Drop clang-split-static-library-exports-into-their-own-export-file.diff
  * Update llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch to not use
    EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL which is not available in cmake 3.5.
    - This fixes build on SLE12.
- Do not force gcc6 on OpenSUSE - fixes build.
- Reduce the amount of concurent link jobs by increasing their
  memory requirement - to reduce stalls in OBS.
- Cleanup %ifarch conditions, remove targets unintentionally added
  to s390/s390x. (bnc#1078436)
- Limit the amount of parallel link jobs, but no longer limit
  compile jobs. This should prevent running out of memory during
  linking while not longer slowing down compilation.
- Remove build dependency on procps
- Reduce disk size requirement to 30GB in _constraints. We no
  longer need that much since we stopped building static libraries.
- n_clang_allow_BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY.patch
  * Allow buildling clang with BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY while the rest
    is built with LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB. (bnc#1065464)
- Remove clang-devel-static.
- Place gold plugin to the right directory. (bnc#1073210)
  * It must be in /usr/lib/bfd-plugins on all architectures.
  * Remove llvm5-gold from baselibs.conf - nothing needs a 32bit
    version of it and it would now conflict with the 64bit one.
- Reduce _constraints requirements on 32bit architectures.
  * Since we had to disable debuginfo on them, they require much
    less.
- ignore make check error for PowerPC as bypass
  https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35871
- disable debuginfo build for ARM as well
- Delete intermediate files during build to reduce total disk usage
  (bnc#1074625)
- Update to llvm 5.0.1
  * This release contains bug-fixes for the LLVM 5.0.0 release.
  * This release is API and ABI compatible with 5.0.0.
- llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch
  * Updated.
- Increase minimum memory and disk sizes required for building in
  _constraints.
- Rename python3-lldb to python3-lldb5 so it can work with llvm
  meta package.
- Rename python packages to follow naming conventions.
- Remove unnecessary dependencies on python3.
- Make opt-viewer not require python2.
  * opt-viewer-Do-not-require-python-2.patch
- Switch to python3.
- Fix %check tests when used with python3.
  * Define LANG=C.UTF-8 when running the tests.
- Add explicit Provides/Conflicts to llvm5-devel,
  clang5-devel-static and lldb5-devel.
  * These are required to be validated by obs repo-checker.
- Use LLVM_OPTIMIZED_TABLEGEN to speed up build. (bnc#1064786)
- Fix files of lldb4 to work correctly with update-alternatives.
- Remove Conflicts clang(LLDB) from lldb4-devel - it does not
  exist. It would be provided automatically, but no such cmake file
  is installed.
- llvm-do-not-install-static-libraries.patch
  * Do not install static libraries instead of installing them and
    deleting after.
  * Reduces disk usage during build. (bnc#1064786)
- Do not build unnecessary parts during stage1.
  * Speeds up build a bit. (bnc#1064786)
- Updated baselibs.conf to reference version 5 packages.
- Deleted rogue llvm5.spec.r29 file.
- Deleted arm_suse_support.diff, llvm-add_a_LLVM_USE_LINKER.patch,
  libsanitizer.patch.
  - No longer used, applied already in the source.
- llvm-normally-versioned-libllvm.patch
  * Change libLLVM naming scheme to match our naming guidelines.
  * The reasons for the original naming scheme are no longer valid,
    more details in the patch.
- Disable all thread related tests in libcxx. Many of them use
  timeouts to detect failure. They can fail randomly if the machine
  is under heavy load (happens often in OBS).
- Drop llvm5-devel-static. llvm5-devel contains shared library with 
  the same content.
- Increase disk space requirement in _constraints to 45GB.
  Otherwise the build gets stuck in random places.
- Skip build of lldb5 python on distributions with swig &lt; 3.0.11
- Copy from llvm4.
- Update to llvm 5.0.0.
- Use LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB instead of BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to build
  single libLLVM library. This is the recommended way. The old way
  was causing various issues.
  * llvm-split-static-library-exports-into-their-own-export-file.diff
  * clang-split-static-library-exports-into-their-own-export-file.diff
  (bnc#1049703)
- Add lld, linker for Clang/LLVM
  (sr#517692)
- Include clang++-MAJOR.MINOR symbolic link
  (bnc#1012260)
- Remove unnecessary dependency on flex and bison.
- Make sure all binaries are managed by update-alternatives
- Add llvm-add_a_LLVM_USE_LINKER.patch and link using gold to
  prevent memory exhaustion on some build machines.
- Reduce debuginfo on x86 architecture. LLVM libraries are so big that they
  exhaust all memory on 32 bit machine if linked with full debuginfo.
- Speed up build by skipping parts that are not required in stage1.
- Build lldb in-tree as one of the llvm tools.
- clang-ignore-stack-clash-protector.patch: ignore -fstack-clash-protection
  for now.
- xlocale.patch: don't use obsolete &lt;xlocale.h&gt;
- libsanitizer.patch: fix use of undocumented types
- build fixes for armv6 (skip testsuite as it requires 64bit,
  set the list of targets to include ARM and remove triplet hack)
- Include provides and conflics in baselibs.conf for llvm4-devel,
  clang4-devel, llvm4-LTO-devel, and llvm4-gold.
- Update to version 4.0.1
  * Minor bugfixes
- Use gcc6 only for SLE boo#1041469
- Package libLLVMFuzzer 
- readd arm_suse_support.diff which was accidentally removed
  in the 4.0.0 update
- Enable AMDGPU and NVPTX targets everywhere except for S/390.
  The AMDGPU target is needed for Mesa Clover (sr#485802).
- Use gcc6 on SLE12 
- Package license &amp; credits 
- Update to version 4.0.0
  * See 
    + http://releases.llvm.org/4.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html and

  clang-incomplete-field-types.patch
  glibc-2.24-libcxx.patch
  llvm-install-CheckAtomic.patch
  revert-cmake-soname.patch
- Enable BPF for all arches bsc#1026191 
- libc++ must depend on libc++abi 
- Stop using otherproviders() due to an rpm parser bug, use
  self-conflicts instead as suggested by mls.
- Add amdgpu_revert_r280589.patch to fix an amdgpu regression
  bsc#1021577
- Require LLVMgold and libLTO in llvm-devel, otherwise we get in CMake:
  The imported target &quot;LLVMgold&quot; references the file
  &quot;/usr/lib64/LLVMgold.so&quot; but this file does not exist.
  This happens when requiring llvm3_9-devel directly, not llvm-devel.

        disregard trivially dead code costs, and 
        can model C++ STL iterator patterns.
   
  Optimizer Improvements
      * The loop unroll pass now is able to unroll loops with 
        run-time trip counts. This feature is turned off by default, 
        and is enabled with the -unroll-runtime flag.
      * A new basic-block autovectorization pass is available. 
        Pass -vectorize to run this pass along with some associated

      * Improved: -Wformat, -Wempty-body, -Wliteral-conversion
      * Clang 3.1 adds support for anonymous structs and anonymous unions, 
        added in the latest ISO C standard. Use -std=c11 or -std=gnu11 
        to enable support for the new language standard. 
        The new C11 features are backwards-compatible and are available 
        as an extension in all language modes.
      * All warning and language selection flags which previously accepted 
        c1x have been updated to accept c11. The old c1x forms have been removed.
      * Generalized constant expressions
      * Lambda expressions
      * Generalized initializers
      * Unrestricted unions
      * User-defined literals
      * Forward-declared enumerations
