  * Qt5.14 - release properly the edit mode animation state
    (kde#412940)

    screen edge and at the same time follow Fitt's Law

  * Latte indicators can offset their icons if they want
  * Latte indicators can provide different length padding values

    taskmanagers), now such applets can be added for all alignments
    including Left/Center/Right
  * Do not show the warning message "Your layout file is broken"

    the way this was implemented in the past it was returning false
    results in some cases
