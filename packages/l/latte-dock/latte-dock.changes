    always the current one after the user has ended its dragging
  * Support fillWidth/Height plasmoids better (such as plasma
    taskmanagers), now such applets can be added for all alignments
    including Left/Center/Right
  * Do not show the warning message "Your layout file is broken"
    when the statement is not valid. This check validates that the
    containments and applets ids are unique in a layout file but
    the way this was implemented in the past it was returning false
    results in some cases
