    specific windows
  * Add availableScreenRegion calculations for Left and Right
    screen edge docks/panels in order to be ready for new Plasma

  * Qt5.14 - release properly the edit mode animation state
    (kde#412940)

  * Improve paddings and margins for applets that are touching the
    screen edge and at the same time follow Fitt's Law
  * Remove workarounds for margins and paddings for plasma systray

  * Close multiple windows from previews when using middle-click
    (kde#411461)

  * Latte indicators can offset their icons if they want
  * Latte indicators can provide different length padding values

    the way this was implemented in the past it was returning false
    results in some cases
