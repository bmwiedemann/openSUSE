  <title>Support for infrared cameras that are not directly enabled out-of-the box</title>
  <description>linux-enable-ir-emitter provides support for infrared cameras that are not
directly enabled out-of-the box (at the very least, the kernel must recognize
your infrared camera). It can automatically configure almost any (UVC) infrared
emitter.</description>
