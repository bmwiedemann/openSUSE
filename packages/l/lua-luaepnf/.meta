  <title>Extended PEG Notation Format (easy grammars for LPeg)</title>
  <description>The LPeg library is a powerful tool to parse text and extract parts of
it using captures. It even provides grammars, which can be used to
parse non-regular languages, but the complexer the language gets, the
more difficult error handling and keeping track of captured information
becomes. luaepnf enhances usage of LPeg grammars by building an abstract
syntax tree (AST) for the input and providing tools for error reporting,
as well as offering syntax sugar and shortcuts for accessing LPeg's features.</description>
