# This is an example system-wide configuration file for the lxc client. Any
# configuration entries added here will be merged with a user's configuration
# when they run "lxc". This is primarily useful for defining system-wide
# remotes, whose certificates are stored in /etc/lxd/servercerts.

# An example configuration (from </usr/share/doc/packages/lxd/doc/remotes.md>)
# looks like the following:
#
# remotes:
#   foo:
#     addr: https://10.0.2.4:8443
#     auth_type: tls
#     project: default
#     protocol: lxd
#     public: false
#   bar:
#     addr: https://10.0.2.5:8443
#     auth_type: tls
#     project: default
#     protocol: lxd
#     public: false
