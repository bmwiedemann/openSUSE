LXD is a system container manager. It offers a user experience
similar to virtual machines but uses Linux containers (LXC) instead.

# This part is quite ugly, so I apologise upfront.
#
# We want to have our _dist/deps/* libraries be dylibs so that we don't bloat
# our lxd binary. Unfortunately, we are presented with a few challenges:
#
#  * Doing this naively (put it in {_libdir}) results in sqlite3 package
#    conflicts -- and we aren't going to maintain sqlite3 for all of openSUSE
#    here.
#
#  * Putting everything in a hidden {_libdir}/{name} with RUNPATH configured
#    accordingly works a little better, but still results in lxd ending up with
#    {Provides,Requires}: libsqlite3.so.0. This results in more esoteric
#    conflicts but is still an issue (we'd need to add Prefer: libsqlite3-0
#    everywhere).
#
# So, the only reasonable choice left is to use absolute paths as DT_NEEDED
# entries -- which bypasses the need for RUNPATH and allows us to set garbage
# sonames for our _dist/deps/* libraries. Absolute paths for DT_NEEDED is
# *slightly* undefined behaviour, but glibc has had this behaviour for a very
# long time -- and others have considered using it in a similar manner[1].
#
# What F U N.
