- Do not execute goals generateTestStubs and compileTests of
  gmavenplus-plugin, since we are not compiling or runnig tests
  during the rpm build. This also allows us to use a wider range
  of gmavenplus-plugin versions, since those executions changed
  names in 1.6.

- Upgrade to version 1.2.8 (bsc#1193795)
  * Changes of version 1.2.8
    + In response to LOGBACK-1591, all JNDI lookup code in logback
	  has been disabled until further notice. This impacts
      ContextJNDISelector and <insertFromJNDI> element in
      configuration files.
    + Also in response to LOGBACK-1591, all database (JDBC) related
	  code in the project has been removed with no replacement.
    + Note that the vulnerability mentioned in LOGBACK-1591 requires
      write access to logback's configuration file as a
      prerequisite. The log4Shell/CVE-2021-44228 and LOGBACK-1591
      are of different severity levels. A successful RCE requires
      all of the following conditions to be met:
      - write access to logback.xml
      - use of versions < 1.2.8
      - reloading of poisoned configuration data, which implies
        application restart or scan="true" set prior to attack
    + As an additional extra precaution, in addition to upgrading to
      logback version 1.2.8, the users are advised to set their
      logback configuration files as read-only.
  * Changes of version 1.2.7
    + Added hostnameVerification to property SSLSocketAppender.
      This fixes LOGBACK-1574.
  * Changes of version 1.2.6
    + To prevent XML eXternal Entity injection (XXE) attacks, Joran
      no longer reads external entities passed in XML files. This
      fixes LOGBACK-1465.
  * Changes of version 1.2.5
    + Instead of an Appender, the LayoutWrappingEncoder now accepts
      a variable of type ContextAware as a parent. This fixes
      LOGBACK-1326.
  * Changes of version 1.2.4
    + Added support for minimum length in %i filename pattern. This
      fixes LOGBACK-1248.
    + For size bound log file archiving, allow
      TimeBasedArchiveRemove to remove files with indexes containing
      upto 5 digits. This fixes LOGBACK-1175.
    + Added %prefix composite converter which automatically prefixes
      child converter output with the name of the converter. This
      feature is quite handy in environments where log files need to
      be parsed and monitored.
- Changed patch:
  * logback-1.1.11-jetty.patch -> logback-1.2.8-jetty.patch
    + Rediff to changed context

    + Access the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass by
      reflection, in order to be able to build with jdk >= 9
