  <title>Lua implementation of Project Fluent</title>
  <description>A Lua implementation of Project Fluent, a localization paradigm designed
to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language translations.
Fluent is a family of localization specifications, implementations and
good practices developed by Mozilla who extracted parts of their 'l20n'
solution (used in Firefox and other apps) into a re-usable specification.</description>
