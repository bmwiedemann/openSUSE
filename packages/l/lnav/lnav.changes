-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Nov  3 08:22:37 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.10.1:
  Features:
  * Added ":show-only-this-file" command that hides all files except the
    one for the top line in the view.
  * The ":write-raw-to" command now accepts a --view flag that specifies
    the source view for the data to write. For example, to write the
    results of a SQL query, you would pass "--view=db" to the command.
  * The commands used to access the clipboard are now configured through
    the "tuning" section of the configuration.
  * Added an "lnav_version()" SQL function that returns the current
    version string.
  * Added basic support for the logfmt file format. Currently, only files
    whose lines are entirely logfmt-encoded are supported. The lines
    must also contain either a field named "time" or "ts" that contains
    the timestamp.
  * Added the "logfmt2json()" SQL function to convert a string containing
    a logfmt-encoded message into a JSON object that can be operated on
    more easily.
  * Added the "gzip()" and "gunzip()" SQL functions to compress values
    into a blob and decompress a blob into a string.
    Interface changes:
  * The xclip implementation for accessing the system clipboard now writes
    to the "clipboard" selection instead of the "primary" selection.
  * The 'query' bookmark type and y/Y hotkeys have been removed due to
    performance issues and the functionality is probably rarely used.
  Bug Fixes:
  * The text "send-input" would show up on some terminals instead of
    ignoring the escape sequence. This control sequence was only
    intended to be used in the test suite.
  * Remote file synchronization has been optimized a bit.
  * Configuration values loaded from the ~/.lnav/configs directory
    are now included in the default configuration, so they won't be
    saved into the ~/.lnav/config.json user configuration file.
  * Key handling in the visual filter editor will no longer swallow
    certain key-presses when editing a filter.
  * Scrolling performance restored in the SQL view.
  * The ':redirect-to' command now works with '/dev/clipboard'
  * The field overlay (opened by pressing 'p') now shows 'log_time'
    for the timestamp field instead of the name defined in the format.
  * The search term in the bottom status bar will now update properly
    when switching views.
  * The "Out-Of-Time-Order Message" overlay will be shown again.
  * The tab for the "Files" panel will be highlighted in red if there
    is an issue opening a file.
  * Overwritten files should be reloaded again.
  * The "jget()" SQL function now returns numbers with the correct type.
  * The "json_contains()" SQL function now returns false if the first
    argument is NULL instead of NULL.
  * The local copies of remote files are now cleaned up after a couple
    days of the host not being accessed.
  * The initial loading and indexing phase has been optimized.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 16 13:47:34 UTC 2021 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.10.0:
  Features:
  * Files on remote machines can be viewed/tailed if they are accessible
    via SSH. The syntax for specifying the host and path is similar to
    scp. For example, to view the files in the /var/log directory on the
    machine "host1.example.org":
    user@host1.example.org:/var/log
    Note that you must be able to log into the machine without any
    interaction.
    Added the ':filter-expr' command to filter log messages based on an SQL
    expression. This command allows much greater control over filtering.
  * Added the ':mark-expr' command to mark log messages based on an SQL
    expression. This command makes it easier to programmatically mark
    log messages compared to using SQL.
  * Added support for archive files, like zip, and other compression formats,
    like xz, when compiled with libarchive. When one of these types of
    files is detected, they are unpacked into a temporary directory and
    all of the files are loaded into lnav.
  * Added an 'xpath()' table-valued function for extracting values from
    strings containing XML snippets.
  * Added the ':prompt' command to allow for more customization of prompts.
    Combined with a custom keymapping, you can now open a prompt and prefill
    it with a given value. For example, a key could be bound to the
    following command to open the command prompt with ":filter-in " already
    filled in:
    :prompt command : 'filter-in '
  * Added support for the W3C Extended Log File Format with the name
    "w3c_log". Similarly to the bro log format, the header is used to
    determine the columns in a particular file. However, since the columns
    can be different between files, the SQL table only has a well-known set
    of columns and the remainder are accessible through JSON-objects stored
    in columns like "cs_headers" and "sc_headers".
  * Added support for the S3 Access File Format.
  * To jump to the first search hit above the top line in a view, you can
    press CTRL+J instead of ENTER in the search prompt. Pressing ENTER
    will jump to the first hit below the current window.
  * Filtering, as a whole, can be now disabled/enabled without affecting
    the state of individual filters. This includes text and time-filters
    (i.e. :hide-lines-before). You can enable/disable filtering by:
    pressing 'f' in the filter editor UI; executing the ':toggle-filtering'
    command; or by doing an UPDATE on the "filtering" column of the
    "lnav_views" SQLite table.
  * Themes can now include definitions for text highlights under:
    /ui/theme-defs/<theme_name>/highlights
  * Added a "grayscale" theme that isn't so colorful.
  * Added the humanize_file_size() SQL function that converts a numeric size
    to a human-friendly string.
  * Added the sparkline() SQL function that returns a "sparkline" bar made
    out of unicode characters. It can be used with a single value or as
    an aggregator.
  * Added a "log_time_msecs" hidden column to the log tables that returns
    the timestamp as the number of milliseconds from the epoch.
  * Added an "lnav_top_file()" SQL function that can be used to get the
    name of the top line in the top view or NULL if the line did not come
    from a file.
  * Added a "mimetype" column to the lnav_file table that returns a guess as
    to the MIME type of the file contents.
  * Added a "content" hidden column to the lnav_file table that can be used
    to read the contents of the file. The contents can then be passed to
    functions that operate on XML/JSON data, like xpath() or json_tree().
  * Added an "lnav_top_view" SQL VIEW that returns the row for the top view
    in the lnav_views table.
  * The "generate_series()" SQLite extension is now included by default.
    One change from the standard implementation is that both the start and
    stop are required parameters.
  * Added the ";.read" SQL command for executing a plain SQL file.
  * Added the "-N" flag so that lnav will run without opening the default
    syslog file.
  Interface Changes:
  * When copying log lines, the file name and time offset will be included
    in the copy if they are enabled.
  * Log messages that cannot be parsed properly will be given an "invalid"
    log level and the invalid portions colored yellow.
  * The range_start and range_stop values of the regexp_capture() results
    now start at 1 instead of zero to match with what the other SQL string
    functions expect.
  * The ":write-cols-to" command has been renamed to ":write-table-to".
  * The DB view will limit the maximum column width to 120 characters.
  * The ":echo" command now evaluates its message to do variable
    substitution.
  * The ":write-raw-to" command has been changed to write the original
    log file content of marked lines. For example, when viewing a JSON
    log, the JSON-Line values from the log file will be written to the
    output file. The ":write-view-to" command has been added to perform
    the previous work of ":write-raw-to" where the raw content of the view
    is written to the file.
  Fixes:
  * Unicode text can now be entered in prompts.
  * The replicate() SQL function would cause a crash if the number of
    replications was zero.
  * Many internal improvements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 25 07:38:04 UTC 2020 - Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com>

- Update to 0.9.0:
  Features:
  * Added support for themes and included a few as well: default, eldar,
    monocai, night-owl, solarized-light, and solarized-dark. The theme
    can be changed using the ':config' command, like so:
    :config /ui/theme night-owl
    Consult the online documentation for defining a new theme at:
    https://lnav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#theme-definitions[1]
  * Added support for custom keymaps and included the following: de, fr,
    uk, us. The keymap can be changed using the ':config' command, like so:
    :config /ui/keymap uk
    Consult the online documentation for defining a new keymap at:
    https://lnav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#keymap-definitions[2]
  * The following JSON-Schemas have been published for the log format and
    configuration JSON files:
    https://lnav.org/schemas/format-v1.schema.json[3]
    https://lnav.org/schemas/config-v1.schema.json[4]
    Formats should be updated to reference the schema using the "$schema"
    property.
  * Indexing of new data in log files can now be paused by pressing '='
    and unpaused by pressing it again. The bottom status bar will display
    'Paused' in the right corner while paused.
  * CMake is now a supported way to build.
  * When viewing data from the standard-input, a symbolic name can be used
    to preserve session state. The name can be changed using the
    "rename-stdin" lnav script or by doing an UPDATE to the filepath
    column of the lnav_file table. For example, to assign the name
    "journald", the following SQL statement can be executed in lnav:
    ;UPDATE lnav_file SET filepath='journald' WHERE filepath='stdin'
  * The size of the terminal can be accessed in SQL using the $LINES and
    $COLS variables.
  * The raise_error(msg) SQL function has been added to make it easier to
    raise an error in an lnav script to stop execution and notify the user.
  * Added the json_concat() function to make it easier to append/concatenate values onto arrays.
  * Added the ":write-jsonlines-to" command that writes the result of a SQL query to a file in the JSON Lines format.
  Interface Changes:
  * Data piped into lnav is no longer dumped to the console after exit.
    Instead a file containing the data is left in .lnav/stdin-captures/
    and a message is printed to the console indicating the file name.
  * In time-offset mode, the deltas for messages before the first mark
    are now negative instead of relative to the start of the log.
  * The $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable (or ~/.config directory) are
    now respected for storing lnav's configuration. If you have an existing
    ~/.lnav directory, that will continue to be used until you move it to
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lnav or ~/.config/lnav.
  * Removed the ':save-config' command. Changes to the configuration are now
    immediately saved.
  Fixes:
  * Added 'notice' log level.
  * If a "timestamp-format" is used in an element of a "line-format", the
    field name is ignored and a formatted timestamp is always used.
  * Ignore stdin when it is connected to /dev/null.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Apr  8 09:07:57 UTC 2019 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.8.5:
  Features:
  * Added a visual filter editor to make it easier to update existing
    filters. The editor can be opened by pressing TAB. Once the editor
    is opened, you can create/delete, enable/disable, and edit the patterns
    with hotkeys.
  * Added an 'lnav_view_filters' SQL table that can be used to
    programmatically manipulate filters.
  * Added an 'lnav_view_filter_stats' SQL table that contains the number of
    times a given filter matched a line in the view.
  * Added a 'log_filters' column to log tables that can be used to see what
    filters matched the log message.
  * A history of locations in a view is now kept so that you can jump back
    to where you were previously using the '{' and '}' keys. The location
    history can also be accessed through the ":prev-location" and
    ":next-location" commands.
  * The ":write-*" commands will now accept "/dev/clipboard" as a file name
    that writes to the system clipboard.
  * The ":write-to" and ":write-raw-to" commands will now print out comments
    and tags attached to the lines.
  * Added a ":redirect-to " command to redirect command output to the
    given file. This command is mostly useful in scripts where one might
    want to redirect all output from commands like ":echo" and ":write-to -"
    to a single file.
  * If a log file format has multiple patterns for matching log messages,
    each pattern is now tried to match a message in a file. Previously,
    only one pattern was ever used for an entire file.
  * Added haproxy log format from Peter Hoffmann.
  * Added 'spooky_hash()' and 'group_spooky_hash()' SQL functions to
    generate a hash of their parameters.
  * Added 'time_offset' to the 'lnav_file' table so that the timestamps in
    a file can be adjusted programmatically.
  Interface Changes:
  * The auto-complete behavior in the prompt has been modified to fall back
    to a fuzzy search if the prefix search finds no matches. For example,
    typing in ":fin" and pressing TAB would previously not do anything.
    Now, the ":fin" will be completed to ":filter-in " since that is a
    strong fuzzy match. If there are multiple matches, as would happen
    with ":dfil", readline's menu-complete behavior will be engaged and
    you can press TAB cycle through the options.
  * Added CTRL+F to toggle the enabled/disabled state of all filters for the
    current view.
  * The '-r' flag is now for recursively loading files. The functionality
    for loading rotated files is now under the '-R' flag.
  * The current search term is now shown in the bottom status bar.
  * Some initial help text is now shown for the search and SQL prompts to
    refresh the memory.
  * When entering the ":comment" command for a line with a comment, the
    command prompt will be filled in with the existing comment to make
    editing easier.
  * Hidden fields now show up as a unicode vertical ellipsis (⋮) instead of
    three-dot ellipsis to save space.
  * Pressing 7/8 will now move to the previous/next minute.
  * The ":write-raw-to" command has been changed to write the entire
    contents of the current view and a ":write-screen-to" command has been
    added to write only the current screen contents.
  * Disabled filters are now saved in sessions.
  * The ":adjust-log-time" command now accepts relative times as input.
  Fixes:
  * The ":write-json-to" command will now pass through JSON cells as their
    JSON values instead of a JSON-encoded string.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 28 06:53:18 UTC 2018 - mvetter@suse.com

- Update to 0.8.4:
  Features:
  * Added the ':comment' command that can be used to attach a comment to a
    log line. The comment will be displayed below the line, like so:
    2017-01-01T15:30:00 error: computer is on fire
    + This is where it all went wrong
    The ':clear-comment' command will remove the attached comment. Comments
    are searchable with the standard search mechanism and they are available
    in SQL through the "log_comment" column.
  * Added the ':tag', ':untag', and ':delete-tags' commands that can be used
    to attach/detach tags on the top log line and delete all instances of
    a tag. Tags are also searchable and are available in SQL as a JSON
    array in the "log_tags" column.
  * Pressing left-arrow while viewing log messages will reveal the source
    file name for each line and the unique parts of the source path.
    Pressing again will reveal the full path.
  * The file name section of the top status line will show only the unique
    parts of the log file path if there is not enough room to show the full
    path.
  * Added the ":hide-unmarked-lines" and ":show-unmarked-lines" commands
    that hide/show lines based on whether they are bookmarked.
  * Added the "json_contains()" SQL function to check if a JSON value
    contains a number of a string.
  * The relative time parser recognizes "next" at the beginning of the
    input, for example, "next hour" or "next day". Handy for use in the
    ":goto" command.
  * Added a "text-transform" option for formatting JSON log messages. The
    supported options are: none, uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize.
  * Added a special "level" field name for formatting JSON messages so
    that the lnav level name can be used instead of the internal value in
    the JSON object.
  * Added a log format for journald JSON logs
  Interface Changes:
  * When typing in a search, instead of moving the view to the first match
    that was found, the first ten matches will be displayed in the preview
    window.
  * The pretty-print view maintains highlighting from the log view.
  * The pretty-print view no longer tries to reverse lookup IP addresses.
  * The online help for commands and SQL functions now includes a 'See Also'
    section that lists related commands/functions.
  Fixes:
  * The HOME key should now work in the command-prompt and move the cursor
    to the beginning of the line.
  * The :delete-filter command should now tab-complete existing filters.
  * Milliseconds can now be used in relative times (e.g. 10:00:00.123)
  * The J/K hotkeys were not marking lines correctly when the bottom of
    the view was reached.
  * The level field in JSON logs should now be recognized by the level
    patterns in the format.

  * The help view now includes all the command-help that would pop up as you entered commands and SQL queries.
  * Hidden fields and lines hidden before/after times are now saved in the current session and restored.
