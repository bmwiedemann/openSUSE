  <title>32-Bit Emulation Utility for x86-64</title>
  <description>This is a small tool for 32-bit emulation in Linux/x86-64. It allows
you to execute programs that need a uname -m of i386 with uname
emulation. The uname -m is inherited by all child programs, but does
not affect the current shell or processes above it in the process
hierarchy.</description>
